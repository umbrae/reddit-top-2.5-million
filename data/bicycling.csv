1352387920.0,2980,self.bicycling,12uxvc,My girlfriend was killed cycling yesterday. I fell like my heart has been torn out. I need help with a Ghost Bike.,4823,1843,627,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/12uxvc/my_girlfriend_was_killed_cycling_yesterday_i_fell/,"Hey r/bicycling.

My girlfriend was hit and killed by a truck yesterday in Denver. She was 23 years old. She just moved out there from our apartment in Brooklyn. I was going to move out there with her after Christmas. I though I was going to marry this girl, and I just don't know what to do now. I feel like my heart has been torn out and run over. 

I don't know if any of you live in Denver, but I want to get a ghost bike set up for her. I'm only going to be in Denver for a day and a half this weekend, and I don't know if I'll be able to do it myself. If you're in Denver and think you can help please let me know. 

My girlfriend and I biked everywhere. Not just for ourselves but for everyone around us. For a better world, with less pollution and healthier people. She led by example. She was constantly volunteering for organizations and events that promoted animal welfare, cycling, and environmental awareness. The world needs more people like her, not less. 

If you think you can help me in any way, please let me know. I won't be able to pay much attention to my computer till I'm out in Denver, but anything helps.

Thanks. 

**Edit:** I just wanted to say, most importantly keep riding, don't let things like this get you down. Nothing pissed my girlfriend off than people who quit riding in the winter. And stay safe. I'm going to reassess the situation when I get to Denver. I felt like I'd never be able to get a Ghost Bike, but it seems like we can make this happen now. Thanks everyone. 

**Update:** The support I've received has been massive to say the least. I've got a bike, it should be painted by the time I arrive in Denver tomorrow. I'll keep everyone updated. If I could convey to you all how much your kind words mean to me and my family I would. Thanks for sharing your stories with me, and kind words.

Additionally, he created the reddit bicycling chatroom and helped it grow to an active real-time chat where people could seek advice and discussion about everything bicycle-related. Anyone who needed help with anything could always count on Harry's kindness, experience and patience.  He inspired many with his [love for cycling](http://i.imgur.com/DxHaa.jpg).

Harry worked at  Smith College and at Laughing Dog Bicycles in Amherst, MA and was a cyclists' rights advocate, an influential attendee of the Hulbert Outdoor Center 'Homeschool week'  and an Eagle Scout. He also took his passion for learning to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he was majoring in computer science. Nothing would stop Harry's passion for cycling. Six months ago, Harry had [broken his leg in an accident](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/pq72l/what_was_your_most_recent_biking_accident/c3re2e9), and he got back on his bike as soon as he could.

Harry [was hit by a car in Northampton, MA,on May 19th](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/txofe/update_on_no_numbers_heres_condition_38_hours/), left-hooked in the middle of an intersection while riding legally. Atypically, he wasn't wearing his helmet. He [passed away from head injuries on the afternoon of Tuesday, May 22nd, 2012](http://www.wwlp.com/dpp/news/local/hampshire/harry-delmolino-of-hadley-bicyclist-hurt-in-northampton-crash-has-died).

We remember him as a kind, intelligent and lighthearted person, with an irreverent sense of humor. He was 18 years old.

We grieve for our friend Harry and give our condolences to his family and friends.

Harry, we miss you. [Ride on forever](http://i.imgur.com/k6nAu.jpg).

EDIT: Spelling.

EDIT 2: Thanks for everyone's very kind words and advice. I'm not really the kind of person who would go to a therapist. I know they help a huge amount of people, but it just isn't me. However, I do have very good friends and a close family who are always there in case i have problems and want to talk about things. Right now i feel ok, but i'm very sad for the man and his family.
I'm very glad that this post has affected people and made them reflect on how dangerous the road can be for cyclists and how caution can save lives. That's precisely why i made the post.
My best to everyone and again, keep safe.

EDIT 3: Hello everyone, thanks again for the support and condolences to the mans family. I have decided to take the description of the event down. I did not expect this post to receive as much attention as it did and as someone has fairly discussed with me in PM it may be insensitive to the mans family to have to read it. This post was placed in an effort to make cyclist more aware and safer and i think it has served that purpose. I am going to speak to the police to give a statement this afternoon and hopefully offer what condolences i have to the family. I am not interested in talking to the media.

It was a straight road (no turns or hills) and the sun could not have been in the driver's eyes.  The car hit them from behind at full speed.  At first glance you might think this was an accident.  BUT Robbie Norton, the woman who hit Jan, got out of the car, looked at Jan, yelled at her for cycling in the road, got back in her car and ran Jan over again.  There were multiple witnesses who stopped Robbie Norton by dragging her out of the car.

Below is the verbatim crash report given to her husband David Morgan:

*THE CYCLIST WAS WEST BOUND ON MS50 NEAR THE TRULOVE LOOP INTERSECTION.  V1 WAS WEST BOUND ON MS50 APPROACHING THE CYCLIST FROM THE REAR.  THE FRONT OF V1 COLLIDED WITH THE REAR OF THE BICYCLE.  THE IMPACT THREW THE CYCLIST INTO THE AIR BEFORE LANDING ON THE HOOD OF V1 AND ONTO THE WINDSHIELD.  V1 CONTINUED FOR A FEW FEET BEFORE COMING TO A STOP.  THE CYCLIST WAS THEN THROWN TO THE ASPHALT WHEN V1 STOPPED.  THE DRIVER OF V1 EXITED THE VEHICLE AND OBSERVED THE CYCLIST WHILE TALKING ON THE PHONE.  D1 THEN REENTERED HER VEHICLE AND RAN THE CYCLIST OVER AGAIN BEFORE BEING FORCED FROM HER VEHICLE BY WITNESSES.  V1 CAME TO FINAL REST FACING WEST IN THE WEST BOUND LANE ON MS 50 JUST METERS WEST OF THE TRULOVE LOOP INTERSECTION.  THE CYCLIST CAME TO FINAL REST NEAR THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE OF V1.*

***BLOG DEDICATED TO JAN***

http://getwelljan.blogspot.com/

Reddit, the problem is, we've just learned they do not intend on pressing charges.  Reason?  The District Attorney, Forrest Allgood, says there are no laws in Mississippi to protect cyclists from this.

Her husband David Morgan and son Sean Dyess would like national attention in an effort to call for cycling safety advocacy.  

If you have any national media contacts please contact David or Sean using the following:

[David Morgan](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1088554856)
https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1088554856

and

[Sean Dyess](https://www.facebook.com/mrhooch)
https://www.facebook.com/mrhooch

As promised, here are some pictures.

[I wonder what is growing in those bottles?](http://i.imgur.com/oMY09.jpg)

Reddit, the only thing Jan's husband David and son Sean are asking for is some national media attention.  If you can help them get it, please do.  They want to keep this from happening to someone else.

I have David and Sean's phone number.  If you would prefer to contact them by phone, e-mail me at: pleasehelpdavid@yahoo.com and I will give you their cell phone numbers.

PLEASE HELP THEM!

**EDIT TO ADD - Please Read:** The purpose of this post was NOT an attack on DA Forest Allgood or the person who hit Jan, Robbie Norton.  The purpose was to get David and Sean national coverage to promote cycling advocacy.  David has accepted that Robbie Norton will only get a misdemeanor charge for hitting Jan.  What he wants is to use Jan's tragedy as an example of what can happen to a cyclist when a motorist gets behind the wheel and does not pay attention.  Please don't think I have tried to intentionally mislead you in any way or to start a witch hunt.  I only want to help my friends.

**EDIT TO ADD - Please Read #2:** As of today, Jan is speaking again!!!  I just heard about it from David a few minutes ago.  After over a month, she is finally able to talk again.  There is not a lot yet, but this is major progress.",,False,self,t5_2qi0s,True,,,True,t3_i6pcr,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/i6pcr/my_friend_was_hit_from_behind_while_riding_her/,

East West Bikes in Fullerton, CA was broken into overnight; 3 bikes stolen, 1 has already been recovered this morning.

The two unrecovered bikes are pictured; the Pegoretti Marcelo has Campy Bora Ultra 2 wheels, not the Enve's pictured.  The Dogma XC is as pictured.

Both bikes are extremely rare in the states (there are fewer than 100 of those Dogma XC's and I'd bet less than 2 or 3 dozen of the Marcelos) so if you're in SoCal or AZ and see either one in the near future, please call the police.

**EDIT**: Just a little disclaimer; not my bikes, not my shop, I'm doing this as an additional outlet to get the word out for my friends who run the shop, and the guy who owns the Marcelo (really sucks for him).

I told the guys to let all the local shops know who they have contacts with, all their sales reps, and the industry rag. They've been in the biz a while and know to watch ebay, craigslist and the like.

1366920696.0,1039,self.bicycling,1d3sum,Accidentally rode in the L.A. Circuit race. I'm soooo sorry.,1227,188,219,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/1d3sum/accidentally_rode_in_the_la_circuit_race_im_soooo/,"This is embarrassing but upon reflection it is kind of funny. 

First off, I went on my normal ride last Sunday. part of this ride takes me down a popular biking stretch that as I approached I could see the car lanes were blocked off but the bike lanes on that side were not blocked. There were no signs indicating why. this road is often used for movies and other purposes so I though maybe there was an event further in. I kept riding.

About a mile or so in, I've passed a person or two and get to what I would describe as the grandstand area (more like an intersection  with a crowd and cameras and an announcer) where there were quite a few people mulling about and looking at me funny. No one said anything. 

Further up I can see tents and things so I keep riding. I feel as though somethings wrong but I haven't put it all together yet.

Just then a pack of about 10-12 riders blows past me followed by a scooter.

Scooter guy slows down a bit, looks at me and very non-chalant he says ""Just to let you know there is another pack coming from behind""

So I thank him and look back.

OMFG I am in the middle of a damn race. I see a huge pack coming. I panic. I swerve into the middle (center island) of the road and the pack (maybe 150-200 people, I'm guessing) is far enough behind that I can clear out safely in time.

So I am in the center island and I just want to GTFO. Any sane man might have just stayed behind the pack and continued on, or moved to the sidewalk. I am not that man. 

I make a decision that seemed logical for the .005 seconds my brain considered it. My embarrassment made me rush. So what did I do? I go to the other side of the road and head back as fast as I can towards the barrier.

[ Edit Clarification: The course was a long straight road that had a east bound and west bound side and u turns at either end. The island was in the middle. I started going east bound (with race traffic) when I switched sides I was now going west bound. Meanwhile the race that was going east bound was going to u turn and come west bound behind me on my side. I was not riding against traffic at any time.]

As some of you may have realized, all I did was effectively take a shortcut to get in front of the pack as it was coming back in the other direction. I start rushing. It just so happens this direction is the harder of the two as you have a slight grade and winds coming at you. I was pushing hard.

I was almost at the barricade, maybe 1/4 mile when the lead pack overtook me again and scooter guy just kept rolling without giving me a second look.

I see the  turn up ahead (at the barricades) and everyone in the lead pack is starting to veer to the right side to prepare for the left U  turn. I realize I need to get out of the fucking way for the main pack but I don't have time. 

Before I realize whats up, I'm getting passed from the left and right side by all these bikes. I'm pushing about 18 mph as a novice. rider that I am.  I'm guessing these guys are doing 25-30 mph easy.

Every other guys that passed me seemed to yell at me ""asshole!"" ""get off the course!"", ""fuck you!"", ""this is a race!"" things like that. 

All I could think was do not stop, do not pull over, do not slow down, hold your fucking line. Meanwhile I'm like a stone in a river with water (bikes) flowing all around me. Then my fear gets worse as I realize I need to be far right to get off the course. If anyone is to my immediate right at the barricade I will have to turn with the pack!

Luckily I got far right and manage to squeeze out of the barricade area as they all made the turn behind me. I was still in the somewhere in the middle of the pack by the time I got out. 

No one told me what was going on. There were no signs that said anything like ""Road Closed For Bike races"" or similar. Had I approached from the other direction it would have been a different story as there were vendor tents and registration at that end. I swear I felt like a fool but yet there was something humorous about it too.

So if any of you were witness to this, I apologize. Hopefully I did not mess you up. 

Edit: I was riding a trek fx 7.1 wearing a bright orange T shirt and a black backpack for you internet slueths.

For those in Houston, I live around Klein High School so my biggest concern are the football players/band member getting out of morning practice and texting away.  I used a helmet and rode on Champions Forest to Cypresswood, past Meyer Park.  My biggest scare were the expansion joints that run parallel to my tires.  I kept thinking I was going to get my front tire stuck in one.  I want to ride with a group but I have to build up to 20 miles for the beginner group rides.

---

This subreddit and the cycling community in general have been buzzing with discussion about Lance’s interview with Oprah tonight. Many sources have reported that Lance will admit to doping in this “no holds barred” interview.

The interview will air tonight at 9 P.M. Eastern Time (and part two tomorrow night), on the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN). ~~Live streams will be posted here when they are released~~. It is ~~expected to be~~ here:

[Live Stream](http://www.oprah.com/own_tv/onc/lance-armstrong-one.html)

Within this subreddit, we’ve seen plenty of posts about the situation (Here are a few to escape with positive karma):

[Initial Announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/167v44/oprah_winfrey_gets_exclusive_interview_with_lance/)

[Possibility of a doping admission] (http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/16f8e8/according_to_usa_today_lance_armstrong_to_make/)

[Humorous Bingo Post]( http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/1685le/bingostrong_play_bingo_while_lance_plays_oprah/)

Anyways, this post is here for everyone to discuss the situation during the interview. Consolidating the discussion to a single post will hopefully clean up the subreddit a bit while it happens. If you don't want to talk about Lance, upvote this one only so that all your misery is contained in one post you can avoid. 

Self posts about the interview will not be removed during the interview and for a few hours after. Post that stuff here in this thread. We’ll allow link posts about it (wrap-ups, reviews, insights, and opinions).

Remember: This is a self post, for which I get no karma. Please upvote it for visibility.


**Secondly, remember to sort the comments by “new” if you’d like to see discussion on things as they happen.**

~~EDIT: [Here's a video of the whole interview.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43EE9I8ZMFc) Thanks to /u/voornaam for the link.~~ The video has been removed.  [Some of the clips have been posted here on Oprah's site.](http://www.oprah.com/own_tv/onc/lance-armstrong-one.html)

EDIT2: We'll be making a separate post for part 2 of the interview. Watch for it tomorrow around 7pm EST.

EDIT3: **[Here is the link to the discussion for the second half of the interview. Discuss things related to it in that thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/16ujc5/mod_post_official_lance_on_oprah_thread_part_2/)**",,False,self,t5_2qi0s,1358554284.0,,,True,t3_16s84x,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/16s84x/mod_post_official_lance_on_oprah_thread_upvote/,moderator

I'm 25 now, and want to learn to ride for exercising, commuting, and just generally having fun with friends. I have no idea how or where to start, though.

1) I live in a fairly urban area in Vancouver, BC, and don't really know where I would/could practice riding to start with.

2) I don't know what type of bike to get. I've done a bit of research, and I know I'd eventually like to lean towards something for commuting and mostly on-road use (actually thinking a good idea could be something like a Surly Crosscheck). I'd probably need something pretty sturdy, as I'm about 5'9"" and 235 lbs. I've only really got enough money and space to consider getting one bike, so my question here is - while it would probably be easier to learn to ride on a mountain bike, would it be that much more difficult trying to learn for the first time on a road-ish bike?

3) Finding a helmet could be tricky, as I have a rather large noggin. Fitted baseball hats for me are size 8 1/8 (in metric, about a 65cm). Any suggestions as to brands/types of helmets that would work, and places in Vancouver to find them?

Thanks, /r/bicycling! Any answers you could provide would be super helpful to this nervous newbie.",,False,self,t5_2qi0s,False,,,True,t3_qhkt2,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/qhkt2/25_years_old_and_completely_new_to_cycling_halp/,

After he passed me and cut me off, he told me to get off the road in your typical misinformed road raging driver tirade.

I hear this sort of thing a lot from drivers, but coming from a uniformed police officer hit a nerve with me and I took his badge number, patrol car number, and filed an official complaint with the BPD. 

I was worried about harassment, because you have to give over lots of personal info to file an official complaint, but I was contacted by an Internal Affairs officer who was very professional. They identified the officer and enrolled him in additional training as a result of my complaint. 

A district wide email blast was also sent out, reminding employees of Maryland's 3-foot passing law (Maryland Transportation Article, 21-1209 a2, ""Failure of vehicle driver to pass safely at a distance of at least 3 feet when overtaking a (bicycle, EPAMD, motor scooter). The fine is $80.00 and 1 point, and $120.00 and 3 points when the violation contributed to an accident.)

I was happy with this. I didn't want to be vindictive and insist on citing the officer (putting points on his license), because the idea is to improve relations between cars and bikes, not worsen them. Extra training and awareness is all I had hoped for.

Still I feel the need to do this. Also, Grammar nazis please go easy on me as I am loaded on pain meds at the moment. I'm probably going to mess up a lot.)

So as I lay here in the hospital having just experienced my first chest tube insertion from my collapsed lung, I'm keep wondering over and over 'why?' Why would you push me like that as I passed you? I called out my intension, I made certain my path was clear, and it completely surprised me that our arms would make any contact. They should not have, in fact, unless you intentionally meant for it to happen. Then after the fact, why did you keep going? I flipped, my ribs broken in 16 places and 6 fractures in my spine and you just went on like nothing happened. As I struggled to get a single breath my only question for the EMT was to ask how you were, and he said you were gone. Didn't even stop. I don't understand your apparent lack of  humanity and it surprises me that you could be so cold and indifferent to a complete stranger who you directly injured. It didn't even occur to me until last night as I replayed the event over and over in my mind that what happened was an outright assault on your part. Now I feel like a naive fool for that, but at least I'm not going to let this experience change me and how I treat others. 

So pain and suffering aside I just like to let you know how your actions go to affect a lot more. I'm stuck in this hospital bed for at least another two days. I expect my final bill will be about about thirty thousand, and while it's certainly not your fault I'm uninsured I can't help but wonder if you're aware of the impact. And while it's also not your fault I'm underemployed this situation has probably ruined my chances at landing the temp-to-perm web developer job I started last week. Can't blame the agency for wanting to find another candidate that they won't have to wait around for because who knows how long it will be until I can even sit in a chair for extended periods of time. I'm possibly ruined and my wife and child will bare the brunt of that. You should know how your actions affect more than just myself. 

You probably won't read this. I will probably never find you again. You've got away with one, providing your conscious will let you, and I'm guessing it probably will. As there was nothing to gain from pushing me except perhaps you got to take your vengeance out on a total stranger who wanted nothing more but to share the path yesterday. My only nagging question to you remains 'why?'

Edit: Thank you very much for the well-wishes everyone. If anything interesting develops I will give an update. 

Edit 2: I appreciate the suggestions for donations, however the hospital does have financial aid for uninsured and I'm waiting to see how much they give me a break. Could be that they cover it up to 100%.",,False,self,t5_2qi0s,1340728283.0,,,True,t3_vls06,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/vls06/to_the_jogger_who_knocked_me_off_my_bike_yesterday/,

Seriously?

There are 4 or 5 good value entry level bikes widely available for 500 quid (more if you know where to look) or under that come with 2300 or Sora components, that are more than enough for somebody to commute hundreds of km a week or take part in sportives and club rides! The 2300 groupset may have a thumb shift, same as older Sora (you use a modern Sora the same as Tiagra, 105, etc) but that's a non-issue for almost all new riders who don't spend most of their rides at high speed with their hands on the drops (I don't find it a problem, even descending at 55+ kph).

So please, for the love of cycling, stop giving new cyclists bad advice : they don't need to spend a grand on a new bike, they don't need cat 3 or 4 racing level components for a weekend ride or a sportive or an amateur level triathlon.

Two friends of mine encouraged my wife and I to get into cycling. A local used bike shop built up a mid-90s Trek 930 for me basically taking the steel frame and adding parts to make it into a comfort bike.  We also just purchased a Giant comfort bike for my wife. 

Today was my third time on the bike and the first time I wasn't scared out of my mind that I was going to hurt myself. The first two times were only a couple of miles as got used to riding a bike again after 20 years. The ride today was on a rails-to-trails path in my city. 

I'm buzzed on endorphins right now and can't wait to take the bike out again this afternoon. Once getting over my initial mini-panic attacks my only problem is that my wrists hurt a lot after 20-30 minutes so I may need to raise up my handlebars. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share my happy day and hopefully in a few months with cycling and diet changes I'll go from morbidly obese to just obese and can get more out of life. Thanks for reading!

I had been riding my dad's old Specialized Allez around for a year or so, and I had the misfortune of snapping the chain stay right where it connects to the seat stays.  It snapped at the beginning of a climb, so I imagine there had been some sort of fault, and the sudden increase in force just snapped it through.  As it was aluminum, and old, I decided not to repair it and obtain a new frame.

I managed to get a, I believe, 1997 Specialized Allez frame.  The paint job was slightly old, and it would have worked but I decided I wanted to take opportunity to follow through on an art project that I had been thinking about for a while.  The [Sharpie Lamborghini](https://www.google.com/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1_____enUS408US408&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=794&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w_fGTtW4BJHRiAL10KTWDw&amp;ved=0CD4QvwUoAQ&amp;q=sharpie+lamborghini&amp;spell=1) was my main source of inspiration.

I used a paint remover in combination with a paint scraper to remove all the paint, finishing up with sand paper to make sure 100% of the old paint had been removed.  Using the ""Rustoleum"" paint series(I was on a budget) I initially applied 3 coats of primer, allowing it to dry between each time, doing a wet sand where there had been a paint streak or buildup.  I did the same with 3 layers of black matte.

I then made it into a community art project, and allowed people who had an influence on my life, and specifically my biking draw what every they wanted using silver sharpie.  To ensure the clear coat would stick, it was exclusively handled with latex gloves.  I then used an entire can of clear coat.

I used all the same components from the previous bike, the only difference being I had to buy a braize on front derailleur.  I wish I had the money to upgrade to new and fast components, but I used what I had available to me.  Building the bike with my friends let me learn an absurd amount about bike construction, and maintenance.  I was extremely happy with the results, it is too infrequent that we have an idea, and follow it through to fruition.  Thanks for taking the time to look at the pictures, and I apologize for the initial phone pictures.

I'd like to thank anyone who called DA Allgood about Jan.  I wasn't expecting anybody to call and I never gave out his office phone.  But  I know some of the calls he got were from here because his ADA posted a response [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/i6pcr/my_friend_was_hit_from_behind_while_riding_her/c21gbza).

News Article:
[http://nems360.com/view/full_story/14494896/article-DA-reopens-biking-case-after-outcry?](http://nems360.com/view/full_story/14494896/article-DA-reopens-biking-case-after-outcry?)

We're not asking the ADA to skirt the laws to find the woman guilty.  We just want her to go before a jury and let them decide based on the facts.  He previously said there was nothing she could be charged with, but we pointed out several possible legal codes.  We'll see what happens.

When the DA didn't press charges, we felt it was open season on cyclists in Mississippi.  See pics from original post below.

My camping gear and cameras were gone, but people are graciously helping me with money to replace those items. I'm just glad to have my bike back and have decided to name her after the badass Italian policewoman that handled the case, Anna.

Someone broke into his garage, broke the lock, and took his bike 2 weeks ago.

Just found it on craigslist in a nearby town.

Gonna go get it back.

Gonna Livestream it from one phone and record it from another. I'll post the link when meeting arrangements have been made, hoping to do it this afternoon! 

EDIT #1: called the cops, as expected they don't want to handle it. they said to call the local cops in the area the seller lives(we found the effer's name/info!!!) and if they're willing they can send a 'civil assist' or something like that. LOOKS LIKE IT""S ON. gonna be around 2-4pm TODAY I'll send a livestream link here. 

EDIT #2: It's gonna be ~2pm California time(-8 GMT). Cops are planning to attend. they need the police report from sf, which sounds like it might be tricky to obtain, but we're going over to get his bike back regardless.
Here's the Livestream link we'll use:

I had to stop at a light in my neighborhood (Washington Heights, NYC). Another cyclist on a Cervelo in a full local club kit pulls up next to me at the light. We nodded at each other as cyclists often do. I recognized his face but couldn't place it under the helmet and sunglasses. I asked him if I'd met him before. He laughed and said, ""Si! I you pizza!"" in a thick Dominican accent. He was my pizza delivery guy. We both had a good laugh and shook hands.


We were both going the same direction so we rode together, traded pulls and chatted for a while. We asked each other about kids and family, the usual small talk and pleasantries. 

After about 15 miles, I was already hurting from the pace. We got a short break when we had to walk our bikes for a block. This is when he tells me that he moved here from the Dominican Republic to train to become a professional road racer. 

He told me that delivering pizzas is the best job for him because he gets paid to ride a heavy mountain bike up steep hills and sprint up apartment building stairs on foot all day to work out his legs. When he told me he was doing all this to become a professional racer as to provide for his mother, wife and children a better life than he had as a boy, he had a special glimmer in his eye.

I had a glimmer in my eye, too, but it was because I was about to cry.

We came to the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge and I was still hurting after a couple blocks of walking rest. We got back on our bikes and clipped in. He gave me a sly grin and asked, ""Fast now?""

He jumped on the pedals and took off like a rocket up the bridge saying something like ""See you soon!"" I tried my hardest to keep up with him.

Apparently, he meant he'd see me soon when I need another pizza, not on the other side of the bridge.

A stranger asks me.",514,73,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/xeofj/would_you_want_it_for_free_a_stranger_asks_me/,"Wall of text warning, I know its practically an olympic sport to do anything for more than 5 minutes but this is worth your time, I think.

After watching the mens Olympic RR on Saturday, I headed out for a solo training ride just before noon. I wasn't feeling too hot and had some indigestion so around mile 20 I decided to grab a bite from Subway, it was right there and I felt icky.  I didn't want to turn around but I wanted to feel strong again, I had a good week on the bike so far but I was behind on my miles.

I'm in my kit and I sit down to eat, browsing the web on my phone, om nom nom nom. Tasty.

Then The guy at the table next to me finishes his phone conversation and then asks me how far I'm going today. I probably was a little too verbose saying I'm not sure, I feel like crap but I'm aiming for 50 miles. We chit chat.

He asks if I like my bike, I say yes and mention I have a couple for different reasons. He asks why would you have more than one. I explain different bikes have different feel, and there are so many bikes out there I want to try.

He mentions he bought a bike but he never could get into it for one reason or another. I sympathize, yeah that happens and its too bad because bikes aren't a cheap investment, but compared to other hobbies like motorsports, its not bad. He says he enjoys taking his motorcycle out to the track.

Yatta yatta yatta, he asks if I'd want to buy his bike. I chuckle and say no I'm not interested, I can't afford a bike, don't have room and my wife would kill me (I just sold 3 bikes), I just booked our honeymoon on credit. I'm picturing an old Allez or a Schwinn from Target. But I don't even bother to ask at this point.

He nods and lightly asks, well do you just want it for free?

I chuckle again and ask why not just put it on Craigslist, just take a nice picture and state the brand and year. He more or less ignores my suggestion. I ask what kind it is and he ignores that reply too.

You sure? It's a good bike, I paid like $5k a few years ago. Well, thats nice, but I think I really don't want a litespeed or a TT bike (I think to myself). We both kind of laugh a nervous stalemate laugh. Oh well, he wraps up his trash and walks out, have a good one we say.

He grabs his dry cleaning next door and pulls away, and I leave too. I put my helmet and gloves back on. I was slightly kicking myself for not following up. Kind of like when a girl is flirting with you and you DON'T get her number because whatever reason.

I roll up to his truck because he's waiting to turn and he rolls the window down.

""I just live two blocks that way (the direction I'm headed). 1234 whatever street. Make a left. Just come by and take a look, it might be worth your time."" He says with a generic white guy smile you only ever see in the movies when some sort of training montage is about to occur.

So I take the bait. I'm in a nice neighborhood in the suburbs of Seattle, right off Lake Washington. I pace myself to look solid and pro, fast but not eager. I pass some dude in normal clothes flapping in the wind on platform pedals. The driver paces himself in traffic and waits for me around each corner to make sure I see him. Then pulls into his long driveway. Not Mr.Burns long, but his house is behind his neighbors. On a hill. Looking out towards the lake.

This is a bad idea. My wife would never do something like this, but shes a woman. I'm a grown ass man. This is Seattle, I can handle just about anything, I've been jumped and fought back in Chicago, I've had people swerve at tail gate me as I ride, in Oakland. But I've seen American Psycho. So again, I'm in my kit and I'm rolling down this guys driveway with somewhat tall shrubs lining it creating real privacy.

He pulls into his *very* clean garage with those giant puzzle piece like floor panels made out of some polymer. I notice right away theres a very nice not-street-legal Ducati 1098 (slicks, no headlight, no turns, no mirrors) in the back and a modest arcade room. Ok this guy is serious but I'm still watching for signs that its a trap. 

He says hey and hang on a minute. I'm standing there in my kit still, with my mtb shoes (on the cross bike with road tires, new road tires actually 28c gatorskins) wondering if anyone is going to see me alive again. I'm looking up at his neighbors 2nd floor windows. Ok at least they can see me and hear me.

Then he pops back to the garage with this black and red bike with flat tires. It's got white handlebar tape and its just about my size but the seat is quite a bit lower as he's 4 or 5"" shorter than me. It's brand new (well, new old stock).

I notice within an instant, an instant filled with shock and confusion that the frame is carbon. There are No TT bars. Then I notice the components, Dura-Ace. They're slightly older (7700), but they're freaking Dura-Ace. This instant where I'm processing what I'm seeing, where I am, what this means and what I'm going to say takes less than a second and feels longer than the entire ride I was on up until this point. I don't even know the guys name and he's telling me I can *have* this bike.

http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7249/7677458074_91a0c0ae4f_b.jpg

Well here it is in my apartment. No strings. Theres no messy divorce he's going through (I really did ask). I didn't have to give him a BJ or give up my cornhole or any sort of man on man bodily fluid swap. No money involved. The dudes just doing really well for himself and wanted the bike to go to someone who'd really use it and we were in the right place at the right time. Yatta yatta yatta...He drops the bike off, wishes me best of luck, and I him.

So I just got a bike. I rode for a half hour on a bike trail against the wind. I'm exhausted. And I don't feel good. My body feels like jello. But it was fun. I think the ""feel good after working out"" thing comes when you're in shape. And I'm determined to get that feeling of exhilaration back for riding. You guys inspire me.

1338832412.0,391,self.bicycling,ukj12,One year in - what I've learned commuting by bike,467,76,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/ukj12/one_year_in_what_ive_learned_commuting_by_bike/,"I posted this on FB a few days ago when I hit my one year anniversary commuting, and a few friends told me I should post it here.   Enjoy/be annoyed by the wall of text!

---

It's been one year since I decided I'd try commuting to work by bike.   I'd thought about it for a while, but my wonderful wife convinced me on Memorial Day of 2011 to finally bite the bullet and buy a bike.   I commuted in on it that next week after my first tentative, short rides.   Now, my main wish is that I'd done it a lot sooner.
 
I realize that's a tough sell for most people.   My commute is 5 miles each way.   I tried to bike every day of the week to start and that was too much, but it only took a month or two before the commute became easy.   On the other hand, I work with people who have 2-3 mile commutes who will not try it on a bike.   Our company has serious parking issues (about 18 employees, only enough room for maybe 12 cars, and all surrounding street parking is permit only), but they still drive.   It shouldn't be a tough sell - it's fun, it gets you exercise, it costs a *ton* less than driving, and you never have to worry about traffic.   It's so much fun that, about 4-5 months after I started, I began looking for longer routes just so I could ride a bit more.   Now I regularly take a longer route up over San Vicente, then diving down the hill towards the ocean, just for fun.   I'll repeat: I make my commute longer so it's more fun.   When's the last time someone said that in LA about driving?
 
Despite that, I really, really encourage everyone reading this to rent, borrow, or buy a cheap used bike and just try for a week.   If not commuting, then just try riding around town, on the streets, for a few days.   It's good to experience the road in someone else's shoes - I find that a lot of things I've done while driving around cyclists before that I felt were completely innocuous are actually pretty harrowing for the guy on the bike.   I hear my friends complain about cyclists blocking the lane really often, and none of them realize that we don't do it to be jerks, we do it when we have to to stay safe.   The first time you nearly get doored is the point where you'll never open your door into an oncoming cyclist again.   Even if you don't ever ride a bike, please read up on what a ""right hook"" is, try not to do it, and for the love of everything good and true, use your turn signals!
 
So what have I learned in the past year?
 
It's great exercise.   I have jeans that I couldn't button at the beginning of this past year, now I have to wear a belt with them to keep them on.   I've gone back and done hikes that used to be really tough, now they're significantly easier (about to test that theory again tomorrow at Icehouse Canyon).   On the downside, it does make you sweaty, which sometimes sucks when you show up to work.   The idea that ""it never gets any easier, you just get faster"" definitely applies to me, I've nearly halved the time that it takes me to get to work, so the sweating hasn't stopped.   The nice thing is, though, at least you feel like you earned it when you're sitting there sweating!
 
It's made me a calmer person.   I don't get as aggravated as easily as I used to, and I attribute that to not being stuck in the car, in traffic, along with getting a good dose of serious exercise a couple of times a day.   Now, when I do, it's just one of those things, there's traffic.   I don't feel like it's something I deal with every single day.   Which leads to...
 
I don't have to worry about traffic reports anymore.   It doesn't matter if Obama is visiting town, or there was an accident on the 405, or there's a protest up by the federal building.   Part of my route is almost always stop and go with people from side streets trying to fight their way onto the main road, and it's a nightmare.   Driving up it is this constant battle between trying not to block intersections combined with having to assert yourself to be able to make it through the intersection at all.   I don't have to worry about that anymore.   Carmageddon?   Still making it home in 20-25 minutes.
 
You actually get to enjoy your neighborhood.   You learn more about it - I had no idea that Ohio actually goes uphill as you head east...it's actually a pretty decent climb.   You learn little side streets that now I use when I do have to drive, but never would have discovered if I didn't just ride through the neighborhood first.   You smell things you don't smell in the car, like flowers in someone's garden or something someone is cooking.   You hear things, like the parrots I heard the other day by the VA hospital in Westwood, then I got to watch them fly away, bursts of green on the blue sky, while my fellow commuters couldn't.
 
It's not as scary as you think it is.   For the most part, folks in LA, at least those on the west side, are pretty good about sharing the road.   It's rare that I've been honked at, buzzed, or tailgated, though those things have happened.   Just take some time to go through some safety guides online, and follow their advice.   Stop at stop signs and red lights (I wish more of my fellow riders would do this, especially the stop sign thing).   Signal your movements, like when you're going to be taking the lane for your own safety.   Drivers will work with you if you're predictable, I find.   When they don't, it's usually pretty easy to catch up to them at the next light/stop sign, where they will invariably roll up their windows and pretend like they don't know you're there, wallowing in their own shame.
 
Rent, borrow, or buy used to start.   I thought I knew exactly what type of bike I wanted, and spent a decent amount on one.   Turns out, I had no idea what I wanted and bought another one a few months later.   I love that second bike, and am looking to sell the first one.   Any takers?   Also, don't buy your bikes from Performance.   Just don't.   Or from a big box store like Target, Walmart, or a sporting goods store (except REI, the Marin bikes they have aren't bad, though they're not amazing either).   They will be much cheaper, yes, but they'll be unreliable and cost you more in the long run, and you'll be damn lucky if they were assembled correctly when you get them.
 
I'd list more negatives, but to be honest, there aren't many.   There's the sweating, and sometimes you're tired - damn tired.   However, I've never dreaded my commute.   I've thought ""This commute is going to be hard"", but never ""This commute is going to suck.""   I look forward to my commute every day, even a year on.   I looked back through some of my tracked rides, and I remember how hard that first ride was when I bought the bike - 2 miles around Westwood.   My legs were tired and I was breathing hard.   Now, both my wife and I are planning on doing 50 miles at the LA River Ride, and it's a distance we've both done, or at least very nearly done.
 
I honestly can't recommend it enough.   A year in and I'm hooked.   Of course, I did end up driving today to save my legs for tomorrow's hike.   Ooops.",,False,self,t5_2qi0s,False,,us,True,t3_ukj12,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/ukj12/one_year_in_what_ive_learned_commuting_by_bike/,

[Link to interview:](http://video.lequipe.fr/video/2cf051f2b00s.html) (in French)

Rough description/translation:

*Jens Voigt, alone on the mountain having been dropped from the leaders, with no chance of winning, finished his last bottle of water. He saw a young child on the side of the road and decided to roll the bottle towards him. However a man pushed the kid aside and took the bottle for himself. Jens stopped, turned around, and biked back down the hill to confront the man.  Under pressure from Jens and the rest of the crowd, he gave the bottle to the young boy. This prompted one of the biggest cheers of the day.*

EDIT: English [blog post](http://bicycling.com/blogs/hardlyserious/2011/12/28/a-gift-from-jens/) from Jens about the incident, which turns out happened two years ago. Still cool!

*Well, I was driving and this damn cyclist was right in the car lane. I mean, everybody knows cyclists are not supposed to be on the road, but on the sidewalk - you guys damaged my car.*

http://imgur.com/wxG7I

**Actually**, this is a magnet. I was thinking, about making a few of them, put them in my back pocket. Whenever you have drivers not sharing the road, or passing ridiculously close to you, throw that on his car, at the intersection. It's a magnet, so no need to carefully place it; it'll just stick without damaging the vehicle. I took a generic ""fake"" scratch design, but would like to make some more ""subliminal"" that aren't associated with fake stickers. They'd be pretty mad,when thinking their car is damaged; maybe they'll think twice next time.

What do /r/bicycling think of this?

The lane was not huge, so cars could not pass me in the single lane section, so, decent person that I hope I am, I upped my pace a little to ensure that I wasn't holding up the cars behind me too much. As I popped up out of the saddle I was surprised to see the vehicle recovery workers to down tools and run alongside me proffering water bottles and yelling ""Allez! Allez!"". Absolutely. Made. My.
