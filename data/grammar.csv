At my current job, we do a lot of work with client-specific websites -- and thus, with clients themselves.  It's expected that the client doesn't have an in-depth knowledge of computer programming or website creation - part of what we do is translate between ""client speak"" and ""programmer jargon.""

Today I was working with a system that, among other things, keeps track of people (and some specific things about them).  In the system, a single person is an ""Individual"" and groups of people are ""Individuals.""  The Individual page might contain a person's name and address, while the Individuals page might contain all people from Nevada.

So the work order comes in, please make some changes to an individual's page.  So, I go to the ""Individual"" page and start looking around for what they want changed.  Mind you, this is a big project - the code that runs this page stretches for quite a while.  Here I am, Ctrl+F searching, grimacing; debugging, cursing; drafting emails of varying politeness to the client to ask them just what in tarnation they want changed, because I sure as hell can't find anything that resembles their request.

Then it hits me: they don't mean ""an individual's page"" -- they mean the ""individuals (pl.)"" page.  

Next time someone says that their misuse of apostrophes to pluralize doesn't hurt anything, you can use this as an example of how it can.  I wasted three hours of my life because of that god-forsaken apostrophe.

But if I say, ""I like whiskey, chocolate and marshmallows,"" to me that implies that I like chocolate and marshmallows *together*, not as individual items.  Almost as if I said, ""I like whiskey chocolate and marshmallows,"" it would seem to imply I like a product called ""whiskey chocolate.""

It focuses primarily on grammar fundamentals as well as the differences between various official styles such as AP, Chicago Manual, MLA, etc.

Today was our first day, so she wasn't really lecturing on anything specific, just going over the syllabus and whatnot. When she was showing us the online homework system, one of the example questions was (what I thought to be) a classic subject-verb ACT-type question:

""This is one of those tests that _______ students crazy.""

a) drives

b) drive

She took a poll of our 12 student class. Five people including myself raised hands for A, and three raised their hands (perhaps more confidently) for B. The other four didn't vote.

I voted A because the subject is ""one,"" a singular noun, so it must agree with the singular conjugation ""drives."" However, she explained to us that B was correct because the singular ""is"" refers to the subject ""one"", while the plural ""drive"" must be used in agreement with ""tests.""

Can someone help me settle this? No one looked very shocked when she said this, so maybe I'm just an idiot. I asked some kids after class, though, and they seemed to have the same initial inclination as me, but they accepted her explanation without question.

I am still pretty confident that the prepositional phrase ""of those tests"" does not affect (what I thought was the) subject ""one."" And I don't understand her explanation for B.

It has a small following who seem to be trying to use it for something like a useful purpose, but its mod has never posted or commented on reddit and its sidebar message displays.. alarming ignorance.

I'm thinking of making a redditrequest to gain control of it; it should be uncontroversial. Before I do, though, I want to make sure I have a clear direction to take it in that doesn't overlap with [/r/grammar](/r/grammar) or any other existing, successful subs.

If there really isn't a great place for it in the current language-related ecosystem, I can at least update the sidebar to point to more appropriate places.

Possibilities:

* A focus on history/discussion/content related to English, rather than on its proper use.

* A focus on learning English as a second language. I thought there was already a dedicated reddit for this, but [/r/languagelearning](/r/languagelearning) doesn't have a sidebar link to it, it's not r/esl, [/r/learningenglish](/r/learningenglish) or [/r/learnenglish](/r/learnenglish), and I can't find the conversation I thought I remembered in my message history. So maybe this is a good idea?

* There's also the possibility of interpreting 'English' to mean 'literature', as in ""English class"". There are probably already a lot of subreddits for this though.

Any other ideas? Anyone else interested in modding?

I understand that use of the passive voice isn't actually a grammatical error, but it is heavily frowned upon, and is something that I've recently been criticized over. However, I'm having a hard time actually understanding why I shouldn't be using it. I'll start things off by providing a simple example—a sentence that utilizes the passive voice, but doesn't strike me as being weak or ambiguous or any of the other terrible qualities that passive constructions are said to possess.
&gt;I have written a number of guides related to the concept of web accessibility.

I understand what makes this sentence a passive construction: it contains an auxiliary verb (""have"") with a past participle (""written""), but I really cannot understand why ""I wrote a number of guides..."" would be preferable. In my mind, my original example has a depth of meaning that would be lost if I used the simple past tense of the verb, although I'm admittedly having a hard time articulating what that enhanced meaning is.

Now, I also realize that the appropriateness of the passive voice depends on the type of writing and its intended audience. I tend to write in a more formal manner, which is perhaps why I often find myself slipping into the passive voice, but, as I've probably made clear at this point, I'm still struggling to see why it's inappropriate in any situation. 

If you want context for the sentence I quoted above, it's from a version of my cover letter, which is obviously something I want to be as clear and concise as possible. Have I indeed committed a heinous stylistic error? I know that use of the passive voice is a topic of some contention within the wide world of grammar, so all I'm really concerned about is whether my writing is as clear as it can/should be. If my critics are just being overzealous, then, well, that sucks, but I'd be glad to know that I haven't been overlooking something significant for the past several years.

Thanks in advance for your help, grammar Nazis.  And yes, I realize that I used passive voice a few times in my post.

I'm taking a composition class and I'm currently writing an analysis of a process. The process I chose to analyze is making an espresso drink (I work at a coffeehouse and I felt that it would be an easy enough process). I handed in my first draft to my composition teacher and found slashes through each time I used *his*. For example,

&gt; The first step in the creation of an espresso drink is to take the customer’s order. A customer may decide what style of drink **he** wants, such as latte or americano, and what size and temperature drink **he** wants, either hot or cold.

Now, in this context, the customer may be either male or female. When my teacher marked my paper, she said that I need to replace each *he* with *he/she* and each *his* with *his/her*. I've since decided to reword sentences so that I don't have to use *he* or *his* to avoid the awkwardness. But my question is...

**TL;DR** Is using *his* in papers offensive to women? Do I need to use *his/her*?

**EDIT:** I'm not trying to sound chauvinistic; I'm seriously curious. I had been taught in high school, and even in elementary school, that *he* was enough to sum up both genders as a neutral-gender pronoun.

**EDIT#2:** I came across some older high school materials I had lying around the house. The curriculum I used was [A Beka Book](http://www.abeka.com/). This curriculum is geared toward private schools but is accepted as a legitimate curriculum. Here is the excerpt from my sophomore grammar handbook concerning neuter pronouns:

&gt; 7.10 d. Antecedents of common *gender* (sex not known) are referred to by *he*, *him*, *his*. It is understood that the masculine pronouns include both male and female.

I, on the other hand, feel that his definition of what's an acceptable definition is too narrow.

My understanding is this:
----
Prefix
A prefix alters the meaning of the root word it's attached to.
----
Root Word
It carries a core meaning that can be altered by suffixes/prefixes.
----
Suffix
A suffix alters the meaning of the entire preceding prefix+root group.
----
However the prefix never alters the meaning of the suffix.

Example: polyphonic vs. monophonic
Prefixes: poly- (many) &amp; mono- (one)
Root Word: phon/ (sound)
Suffix: -ic (of or pertaining to)
Meaning: in this case, -ic mods either polyphon/ or monophon/. 
polyphonic - pertains to when a synth can play many notes simultaneously.
monophonic - pertains to when a synth can play only one note at a time.
(The prefix poly- doesn't mod the meaning of the suffix -ic in any way.)

To summarize:
Suffixes and prefixes have independent meanings that are protected from each other and immune from alteration. This makes them useful for communication.

&gt; In terms of meaning, there is no difference between the two words. When you say that something was ‘worthwhile', you mean that the time, money or energy you spent on it was worth it. In other words, you are quite happy with the result. In the past, careful users of the language wrote it as one word when it was used as an adjective – when it was used before a noun. For example, Abhai wants to get involved in some worthwhile cause. In all other contexts, it was written as two words. For example, it might be worth while to talk to your uncle. Nowadays, this distinction is seldom maintained; there is a tendency to use the single word in all contexts.

Anyone back on topic, today's post was about this quirky mayor in a town in Columbia. He used mimes to mimic jaywalkers in a campaign to reduce pedestrian-traffic fatalities. Here is a direct quote describing the outcome:

&gt;Before Mockus' programs went into effect, traffic fatalaties were at about 1,300 a year; after, they dropped to 600 -- more than half.

When I read that, it just didn't look right, but I'm not sure. 600 is certainly *less* than half of 1,300, but I suppose the choice of [less/more] could be referring to the decrease, which was more than half the original. Either way the meaning is clear, I'm just not positive if it's grammatically/semantically correct. Can anyone weigh in?

EONS then explained himself like this:

&gt;[""Whomever came up with"" is a noun clause and is the subject of ""is a genius."" Whomever is the correct word.

&gt;[It can't be analyzed as ""he came up with the idea... is a genius."" ""he came up with"" is instead acting as a noun itself, which means it is the subject of ""is a genius."" Thus, you use ""whomever.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1jknpk/whose_line_is_it_anyway_sideway_scene_usa_2013/cbfrtvt?context=3)

&gt;[Use of whomever is fading out as more and more people fail to be taught the actual rule for it - and I don't blame anyone for that, the rule is complex and most high schoolers don't even know what a prepositional object is, yet alone a noun clause.

I predict the heat to win many championships down the road, but this year they have one small flaw that could be exploited by a  Tough Pacers team. 

The Heat have smacked around the entire NBA. Taking no Hostages, and holding nothing back on their phenomenal season, but in the few losses they do have there has been ne coommon denominator, and that's the clear disadvantage the have on the boards. The Heat simply cannot compete with the best of them on the glass on a night in and night out basis, and that could create a problem deep in the playoffs.

Theres an old saying ""Offense wins games, Defense wins Championships"". This phrase couldn't be more true. Just ask Peyton manning. Now when you apply this to basketball you can add rebounding to the end of that. When it comes down to championship time you can forget all the flashy offense and dunks shown on ESPN via the high-flying heat. At the end of the year it all about who's tougher and who can do the small things the best, Who can grab a board in the fourth, or who can hustle for that loose ball. When thinking of a team that does all of those things on a consistent basis only one team comes to mind, and it's not the Heat. It's the Indiana Pacers.

The Indiana Pacers are absolutely loaded with young talent. Including Paul george, Roy Hibbert, and defensive stud Lance Stephenson. The Pacers have such depth at the power forward with David West and Tyler Hansbrough that I'm not too overly concerned with the injury to Danny Granger. However he does give a lengthy body in the paint that can stretch the defense with his mid range jumper on the offensive end. The one thing the Pacers do exceptionally well that makes me love them is rebound. With the 7'3 monster that is Roy Hibbert inside. Along with all the other lengthy rebounders around him. They have proven to be a major  Hassle on the glass. Especially against a team like the Heat who struggle to get rebounds late in games. I'll admit it its a longshot at best, but if there's one team that can do it now. It's the Pacers.

I often come across sentences that will talk about a company doing something, and it will be phrased like, ""Apple have released a new phone,"" or ""Nintendo are holding a press conference today.""

This jumps out to me as being wrong, since a company, although composed of multiple people, is obviously a single entity. In that case, one should, of course, use ""has"" instead of ""have"" or ""is"" instead of ""are"".

I am still unsure how to explain it though.  It´s almost like ¨being shot¨ is a being used as a noun in this situation so therefore you use ¨his¨ to show ownership of the action.  Am I way off with this? Is it wrong to use ¨him¨in that situation or is it word choice? Anyone have any proper grammar rules for this I´ve been looking around, but I can´t find anything.

1359238000.0,8,self.grammar,17c3t8,A question on the placement of adverbs and how it affects their stress.,9,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/17c3t8/a_question_on_the_placement_of_adverbs_and_how_it/,"So I was just thinking about how switching the place of an adverb can change a sentence or make things more poetic (e.g. The fire burned brightly. vs. Brightly the fire burned.) (the latter may not be entire correct in its grammar, I can't recall, though poetry does tend to bend rules) but I started wondering if there is a typical trend in sentences that mean damn near the same thing but have some connotative stress added to them by putting the adverb closer to the beginning:

* If only I had listened to her.
* If I had only listened to her.
* If I had listened only to her. (different mean really)
* If I had listened to only her. (ibid.)
* If I had listened to her only. (slightly different than the first two, but still along the same lines.

Or:

* Actually, I didn't kill her.
* I actually didn't kill her. (bit awkward, but the point is made)
* I didn't actually kill her. (different meaning)
* I didn't kill her actually. (or is it, "", actually""?)

Anyway, in both sentences putting the adverb as close to the beginning as possible seems to give the most emphasis to the phrase. Am I completely off base or is this a relatively reliable pattern (at least among simple sentences)?

**TL;DR:** Do sentences with adverbs closer to the beginning of the phrase have more power than those with the adverb further down the line (whilst still preserving their basic meaning).",,False,,t5_2qhwy,False,,,True,t3_17c3t8,http://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/17c3t8/a_question_on_the_placement_of_adverbs_and_how_it/,

But I can't put my finger on what it's doing; at least, I can't find any definition for it that would explain its purpose. It doesn't seem to be a preposition, nor does it appear to be acting as a conjunction. Is it even correct?

Would the sentence be better off with **if** substituted in?

&gt; Due to multiple threats made against Assistant Coach Mike McQueary, the University has decided it will be in the best interest of all if Assistant Coach McQueary is not in attendance at Saturday's Nebraska game. 

Note that I've adjusted the verb tenses (""will"" instead of ""would"") to reflect a conditional ""if"" clause that predicts a possible/factual outcome instead of going with the subjunctive. Is this accurate? Knowing when and when not to use the subjunctive is a pain in the ass.

**""Ah! As if a soft breeze *is* going to... softly stroke my cheek and fly away""**

**""I'm just forgetting until the point of emptiness""** or **""I'm just forgetting to the point of emptiness""**

**Complete the second sentence so that it has a similar meaning the the first one, using a gerund.**

**e.g. It can be expensive to eat out -&gt; Eating out could be expensive.**

This exercise is pretty straightforward, but there are two sentences that bother me.

The correct answer, according to the key section, is *I hate people dropping their rubbish in the street*

The other one:

*My mother-in-law can't stand people who smoke when she's eating.*

The correct answer: *My mother-in-law can't stand people smoking when she's eating*

I might be misanalyzing that, but ""smoking"" and ""dropping"" in those cases seem to be instances of present participle and not gerund. In something like ""I hate dropping rubbish"" and ""She can't stand smoking"" dropping and smoking would be examples of gerund, of course.

I'm a first year teacher in ESL.  I was an English major back in the States, and had general interest in language and always thought I knew how language worked pretty well - but this year has taught me just how much common usage I really have difficult time explaining.  

I was explaining the word priority yesterday and used the sentence ""The children are our first priority"" and one of my brighter students asked me why it was priority and priorities. This was a sentence i had never questioned as a native speaker, but I could understand her confusion - since children is a plural word and its usage as plural is reflected by ""are"" - why then is the complement not singular?  Is it because The children are in a sense - one unit inasmuch as they relate to the priority? If so then why is the verb still are?  

Unless someone has a better suggestion that's what I intend to tell my students tomorrow.  But really, trying to explain why certain words are singular and/or plural in a given context is one of the hardest parts of trying to teach them authentic American English.  If anybody has any tips or sources to refer me to, it would be greaaatly appreciated.

 I didn't want to correct you publicly, and I do appreciate investigative reporting, especially about animal welfare.  However, confusing ""its"" with ""it's"" is a really bad mistake.  ""Its"" is a possessive pronoun which, like ""his"" and ""hers"" requires no apostrophe.  ""It's"" is a contraction for either ""it is"" or ""it has"" and does use the apostrophe.  Therefore, sadly, the dog died in its cage.
Perhaps something such as auto-correct did this, in which case, I apologize.
Here's the reply:
so nice that you're so much smarter than the reporters and editors at the [name of newspaper.] We all know the difference between   ""it's""  and ""its."" Don't need -- or appreciate the grammar lesson.....but thanks for reading.
ps-- this story was not investigative reporting. Just the kind of thing we all do every day.

OK, I understand how tone can be misinterpreted over the internet.  I understand the person was probably just having a bad day. I wasn't trying to show off that I am smarter than everyone who works for the main newspaper of a major American city, and I tried to convey that by emphasizing that I did not correct her publicly, and by acknowledging that sometimes autocorrect does this.  Perhaps publication was rushed to make a deadline.  However, these errors that make all of us ""nazis"" cringe have been occurring more often and I just couldn't take it any more.  I had never written anything like this before.
I have to admit that I am ridiculously hot over this. I had thoughts of publishing the whole thing on facebook or even writing to the rival newspaper about it. Perhaps I would apply for a job as proofreader, somehow using the mistake in the article to show this woman's boss why they need me. (I know, that's realistic!)  In my mind I constructed shitty replies, as well as kind replies. Probably, I will do the smartest and kindest thing: cool off and do nothing.  In fact, I feel much better now that I've ranted to all of you fellow language lovers, so thanks in advance.
Also, could someone please explain the difference between investigative reporting and other reporting?

&gt;.2.  Use ""which"" with nonrestrictive clauses. A nonrestrictive clause may tell us something interesting or incidental about a subject, but it does not define that subject. When writing a nonrestrictive clause, introduce it with ""which"" and insert commas around the clause. (However, if the subject is or was a human being, use ""who"" to introduce the clause and insert commas around the clause.) 

&gt;Correct Nonrestrictive Use: 
The painting, which was hanging in the foyer, was stolen.

&gt;Explanation: While this nonrestrictive use tells us that the painting was hanging in the foyer, it does not tell us which of the several paintings in the foyer was the stolen painting. **It would be incorrect to use this nonrestrictive clause if there had been only one painting in the foyer**, as the sentence leaves open the possibility that there were others.

I believe it could be correct to use the example sentence if the painting in question had been clearly identified in preceding sentences. The phrase ""which was hanging in the foyer"" could simply be used as a bit of extra information for the reader about the situation surrounding the theft, whether the painting was alone there or not.

For example:

The difference is somewhat important in how words are treated grammatically (""I have a few apples"" is correct but ""I have a few money"" is incorrect).

Now, you can usually come to a reasonable explanation as to why one noun is a count noun and why another noun is a non-count noun (apples are really easy to count and you would normally count apples as individual apples, but money is counted in a variety of different ways using many different denominations of currency and coinage).

Now, there are a few nouns that just bother me in terms of how they are treated: vegetables is a count noun but fruit is a non-count noun (""I need a few vegetables"", ""I need a a little fruit""), and corn is a non-count noun but beans is a count noun! 

I have yet to hear a good rule that distinguishes count and non-count nouns in a way that consistently categorizes nouns correctly. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, proper grammar is partly determined by common usage as opposed to common obedience to some archaic set of rules established by our ancestors.

A German friend wrote ""I actually had not known that the museum was... [insert descriptive elements]""

I have never seen this use of a past participle with have &amp; know (I'm french), it seems people just use the preterit (I did not know that...). 

I am aware that the preterit and the past participle don't express the same kind of timeline and that there is a difference of meaning between ""didn't know"" and ""hadn't known"".

Is there a rule preventing the construction ""I had not known"" out of a conditional mood? Or is it just so rarely used that I didn't know it could be done?

Specifically, I think I remember from grammar lessons that the present or past participle put a stress on the implications that the verb in the participle has on the present/past situation. Which would explain the use of ""had not known"" with a conditional sentence: ""If I had not known that, then I would (not) have done that"". The consequences of knowing or not are obvious.

Could it be that what bugs me with this use of ""had not known"" by my friend is that it's a plain statement without consequences? It's literally a description of the museum she went to a few days ago, she's in vacations. Is it still correct to use a past participle in this case, or even, is it the most correct way to do it?
