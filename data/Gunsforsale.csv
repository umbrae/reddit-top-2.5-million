He can also have a mailing address (like a P.O. Box).

Q: Can an FFL ship a firearm to an address that is different from the business premises address identified on the license?
Yes. Neither the GCA nor its implementing regulations contain specific provisions, requiring that an FFL have firearms shipped to their licensed business premises when receiving firearms. To that end, an FFL may lawfully receive firearms at their mailing address, storage location, or other address where the licensee intends to ensure safe and secure receipt of the firearms.

Source: http://www.atf.gov/publications/newsletters/ffl/ffl-newsletter-2006-03.pdf

You should also be certain that the person is indeed an FFL holder. It is not required that an individual (non-FFL) have a copy of the license; but you should believe in some manner (business card, website, storefront) that he indeed has an FFL.

An individual cannot use the USPS (Post Office) to ship a handgun, but can use UPS/FedEx.
There should be no indication on the outside of the package that it contains a firearms. Like Joe’s Gun Shop, I’d just address the package to Joe’s. Navy Arms ships their guns as “NA Corporation”.

Q: May a nonlicensee ship a firearm through the U.S. Postal Service?
A nonlicensee may not transfer a firearm to a non-licensed resident of another State. A nonlicensee may mail a shotgun or rifle to a resident of his or her own State or to a licensee in any State. The Postal Service recommends that long guns be sent by registered mail and that no marking of any kind which would indicate the nature of the contents be placed on the outside of any parcel containing firearms. Handguns are not mailable. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun.
[18 U.S.C. 1715, 922(a)(3), 922(a)(5) and 922 (a)(2)(A)]

Q: May a nonlicensee ship a firearm by common or contract carrier?
A nonlicensee may ship a firearm by a common or contract carrier to a resident of his or her own State or to a licensee in any State. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun. In addition, Federal law requires that the carrier be notified that the shipment contains a firearm and prohibits common or contract carriers from requiring or causing any label to be placed on any package indicating that it contains a firearm.
[18 U.S.C. 922(a)(2)(A), 922(a) (3), 922(a)(5) and 922(e), 27 CFR 478.31 and 478.30]

Never ship a loaded gun and never package ammo with a gun. Never ship ammo by USPS....only UPS/FedEx.

Q: What record-keeping procedures should be followed when two private individuals want to engage in a firearms transaction?
When a transaction takes place between private (unlicensed) persons who reside in the same State, the Gun Control Act (GCA) does not require any record keeping. A private person may sell a firearm to another private individual in his or her State of residence and, similarly, a private individual may buy a firearm from another private person who resides in the same State. It is not necessary under Federal law for a Federal firearms licensee (FFL) to assist in the sale or transfer when the buyer and seller are “same-State” residents. Of course, the transferor/seller may not knowingly transfer a firearm to someone who falls within any of the categories of prohibited persons contained in the GCA. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) and (n). However, as stated above, there are no GCA-required records to be completed by either party to the transfer.

There may be State or local laws or regulations that govern this type of transaction. Contact State Police units or the office of your State Attorney General for information on any such requirements.

Please note that if a private person wants to obtain a firearm from a private person who resides in another State, the firearm will have to be shipped to an FFL in the buyer’s State. The FFL will be responsible for record keeping. See also Question B3.

As of today, I'll be helping out around here to make things a little more streamlined and easier to find what you are looking for.

There are going to be some changes made both in policy and in the way the subreddit is presented. I'm going to outline them below:

* Links will now be colorized according to the type of transaction (Color suggestions welcome).

* Links will prioritize the color based on the FIRST tag (i.e. ""WTS/WTT"" will categorize as ""WTS"").

* Links will fade once visited in order to make new posts more visible.

* Users will have the ability to sort links by transaction type (e.g. ""WTS"" only or ""WTB"" only).

* Users will have the ability to sort links by state.

* Links will now be given a small flag to indicate which state the transaction originates in.

* We will be cracking down on improperly formatted posts. Please format your post as follows:

    *Example:* [WTS] Colt AR-15 .223 [NY]

    Note that the transaction type is at the beginning and the state is at the end.

* Buyers and sellers can become verified by the moderation team and given ""approved buyer/seller"" flair. If you engage in a successful transaction, please send us a link to your post and tell us how it went.

* Conversely, buyers or sellers who scam or in any way engage in fraudulent behavior will be banned.

* If your transaction is completed successfully, please message the moderators with a link to your post so that we can mark it as completed. You may also delete your post if you wish.

* If you suspect someone is engaging in illegal or fraudulent activities, please inform the moderation team. 

* Finally, if you wish to discuss the state of the subreddit or make any announcements, please use the [META] tag in your post.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback. As always, we encourage you to read the rules in the sidebar before posting. If you mess up your post, just remove the old one and repost it with the correct formatting.

Thanks,

Earlier this year, we added the ability for users to become ""trusted"" traders so that you know you are working with someone who another redditor had a smooth transaction with. 

Last week, we took things a step further and enabled all of you to collect points from each transaction, further proving just how trustworthy you are! 

Well, it turns out that this was a lot of work for our mods! Over 150 of you have become ""trusted"" traders over the past few weeks. This translated to lots of time spent editing flair and checking transactions. 

Today, we are pleased to announce the introduction of me, /u/Guns4SaleBot! I am an automated robot thing and I will be handling transactions on the mods' behalf. 

**Here's how it works:**

After you successfully complete a transaction, you will need to send me a private message. It's easiest for me to understand you if you put the name of the person you traded with in the title of the message (in the format of /u/USERNAME) and a link to your transaction in the body of the message. If you get these parts wrong, I'll write back and let you know.

Once you write me, I will update the flair for the person you traded with. If you want to get your flair updated, you will need to make sure your trading partner writes me, too! Keep bugging them until they do it or get in touch with the moderators if they refuse. Don't forget to update your post's flair to ""Completed"" -- I don't quite know how to do that yet.

If you have any problems with your transaction, please get in touch with the moderators. They can handle problems my little robot mind cannot.

There are lots of more cool features coming soon, so make sure you keep an eye out for more announcements.

Thank you all for posting and reading, and making this community happen.

Since I've started this subreddit, a few things have come up that made me decide to come up with some official ""Rules for Posting""

1. Your state **MUST** be listed in the title. Forget to list it? Copy-Paste-Delete Repost. Simple enough. 
1. Dealers **MUST** put **""FFL""** in their thread title. Not sure if you're a dealer? Easy guideline: If you can't sell the gun in a FTF transaction, you're a dealer. Typically, an 03FFL (C&amp;R) doesn't apply.
1. **ALL WTS** ads must have an **asking price.** Whether it's the price you'll let it go for or not doesn't matter, let it at least be a starting point of negotiations. 
1. **NO LINKS** to auction sites (Action Arms, Gunbroker, GunsAmerica etc.) or other sites you have the gun listed. (AR15.com, Cruffler, Craigslist etc.) This reddit is not designed to be a place to dump your link onto, take the time to post a real ad.
1. There is **NO AD-STOMPING**. Don't like the price, or think the gun is a POS? Take it to PM. Everyone has the right to sell what they want for whatever they want. If the price is outrageous, odds are it won't sell.
 

Simple enough, no!? 
I will, for now, keep posting in ads that are not of the required format, requesting they be changed. If no changes  or additional posts containing missing info are made in a reasonable amount of time, your ad will be deleted. 

 
 Furthermore, my wife and I are expecting a little girl to come into our lives any day now, and my time spent here will be less for a while. ~~I will ""be taking applications"" for a co-moderator. Shoot me a PM if you want to help.~~

I'd like to welcome **Itsgoodsoup** as the new R/Gunsforsale co-moderator!

It weighs in at a healthy 13lbs without ammo due to its steel construction and American walnut wood.

Comes with 1 50rd drum, 3 30rd stick mags and 2 20rd stick mags, 1 GI issue 3 mag pouch, and a hard foam case.

I have put around 500-700 45ACP down the pipe and she shoots great. Kinda kicks like a .22 due to its heft imho

I had the idea of sticking image flair in like /r/stopsmoking and /r/stopdrinking to give it a more ""leveling up"" kind of feel.

Everyone who is currently ""trusted"" will start off at level 1, but if you care to link your past transactions to me, I'll give you the appropriate level. It will take some time to get this implemented fully, but I plan to have a bot running things so that we don't have to. 

Here's what I need from you:

* If you complete a transaction for the first time, you will earn your Level 1 Trusted flair.
* If you already have ""trusted"" flair, PM us after a successful transaction and include **+1** in your message (as well as a link to your post and who you traded with).
* As always, it is important for both parties to contact us. This helps us be sure that the transaction was pleasant for both of you.

This way, it will be easy for us (or the bot) to go in and increase your points accordingly. 

Example transaction:

* Bob buys a 1911 from Steve. 
* Bob and Steve message the mods with a link to their post.
* Bob has no flair and earns Trusted level 1.
* Steve is already trusted, so he includes ""+1"" in his message.
* Steve is promoted to Trusted level 2.

What do you think? Let us know!

*How do I buy or sell a gun using Reddit?*


* This Reddit is only meant to connect the potential buyer and/or seller of a firearm, or firearms parts/accessories.


* **Post what you have, what you’re looking for, and where you’re located in the US in the title.**


*  Post title should read something like:  **WTS/WTT/WTB  GUN/PART/ACCESSORY (State)**


* **Make sure you add a price in the body, or what you’re looking for in trade.**


* Although not required, posting a picture (Imgur is a great and free image host) is a good idea. 


* Sellers can prefer not to ship a firearm out of state, but do an in-state face-to-face transaction. If this is the case, make sure you mention it. 

* No links to auction sites or ads hosted elsewhere. This reddit is not intended to bring traffic to Gunbroker/Gunsamerica, or wherever you have your gun listed on. 


* **make sure you check all laws applicable to yourself and the buyer/seller. **




*So I bought/sold a gun from/to someone out of state, now what??*


* As the buyer, the first thing to do, after the deal is struck and the details ironed out, is go to your local FFL, and tell them that you need to transfer a gun in from out of state. Your FFL will be able to assist you.
The idea is, that the seller can **only** ship a firearm to a FFL dealer in a state, so he must be sure that the recipient is in fact one.   

(Pro-tip: If the FFL is not willing to give out their FFL to an individual, the seller can verify the FFLs status on the [FFLeZCheck](https://www.atfonline.gov/fflezcheck/) using the first 3 and last 5 digits of the license number. 

* Once this is completed, and the gun is sent to the FFL of the buyer, the procedure for the buyer will become the same as if the gun was purchased from the FFL. Background check, call in, wait time, or whatever your state requires. 


Simple as that!

*A few more pointers*

** Be aware, there are states where certain rifles, handguns and magazines are still (or again) banned. If you have a buyer, and you're not aware of the legality of the transfer, research it, or ask. **

* Funds can typically be transferred via Certified Mail, USPS Money orders or Cashier's checks are advisable. While I don't condone it, ""discrete Paypal"" can be used, although if Paypal finds out you're violating their policy, you will lose the fund. 

* Gunbroker has a [FFL Search Function](http://www.gunbroker.com/FFL/DealerNetwork.aspx) for those who don't have a ""Regular"" dealer they use. 

* Example Bill of Sale can be found [here](http://www.kcarmstrader.com/billofsale.pdf).

If you see something you like please comment with ""I'll take XXXX"" and then shoot me a PM. If you are interested in an item but need more info or want to haggle me down and take food from my children's mouths (I don't even have kids) then just shoot me a PM. First come first serve, but I encourage you to call dibs on seconds in case a sale falls through. 

As for payment I accept DISCREET PayPal (If you mention gun stuff on the transaction and get my account frozen, I will shit in a box and mail it to your house every Monday for the rest of my life) I also accept Chase Quick Pay, or cold hard cash in a FTF transaction. If you don't have one of those options available to you, PM me and maybe we can work out a deal for a USPS Money Order or indentured servitude.

If it needs to be shipped I'll calculate the charges and add the exact amount.

Here is the breakdown of the rifle and what has been done to it:

- SLG95, desporterized with Navy G3 SEF Lower and Tac-Mag Release - $1880

- MagPul PRS-2 Stock - $250

- Bolt Microslicking (Dry Film Lubricant) - $150

- Wide Texture Forearm with H&amp;K G3 Bipod - $148

I took this thing in from an owner who had it since the and it was, and still is, in great condition. This used to be a military rifle that was then configured by FMP for export (with a welded semi-auto shelf). I had to do some work on it to fix a few things (Such as replacing the rear sight, and installing a Tactical-Mag release on it) and decided to turn it into a target and combat rifle. It has a Magpul PRS-2 sniper stock along with a microslick treatment to the bolt for a smoother action. It runs like a charm and has eaten anything I fed it, even Iraqi surplus (~80 rounds of test ammunition through it). I've got the original handguard, stock, a few replacement parts and armorers tools I will send with it as well should you buy it.

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/yqSlt)

I built it from an Izzy kit, using a KMP plate and trigger/sear.
Internals were machined by Iron Creations LLC.

It was originally built by me in 7.62x54R, but I changed it to 8mm. The only thing it's missing to run 8mm is the correct size booster. The .308 izzy booster is still on it. So with a 30.06 booster it can run 8mm, and with a .308 barrel from Sarco it can run .308. 
Included with the gun are a (bought new) Iron Creations Tripod and T&amp;E.
Also included are 1919 TM, some spare springs, cartridge stop, etc, as well as a spring buffer made for me by a member of 1919A4.com
Comes with what I estimate to be between 2500 and 3000 izzy links, a 5 round quick linker and a loader that works very well. Not built by me, but its' unmissable.
Just about everything less the driveway in the pictures is included.

I'm not looking to break up the package, and shipping is not included.
Receiver can be separated and shipped to UPS to FFL, and the rest can be shipped ground to your house.

$2,100.00. USPS Money Order/Certified Funds or discrete PayPal +4%
Once again - shipping NOT included.

I bought this gun mid panic, and would rather use the money to get a new bow. It has only 85rnds through it, so it's not even through its break in period.

Ok, here's my situation. I **just** finally got my ccw permit last week. The problem is that now the weather is warming up and all I have is a moose killing S&amp;W K frame .375 magnum revolver. Not exactly something I can conceal in summer clothes.

So, I'm hoping to acquire a pistol in the compact to subcompact range. As for caliber, I'm looking for preferably 9mm, but anything between the .38 .40 range is alright too.

So what do I have in return? A [kettle helm and a buckler](http://imgur.com/a/EEAqV). I used to do medieval living history, but I've since burned out on that. The kettle helm I bought originally for $250 and the buckler I had custom made by [François L'Archevêque](http://flarcheveque.wordpress.com/) an extremely talented French Canadian armorer. The helm is 16 gauge steel and the buckler I believe is either 16 or 14, can't remember. 
I also have an extra ash longbow with a 35lb draw weight.

I'm fairly cash poor at the moment but things are negotiable. We can mix and match items, or an item and some cash. More details and pics available on request.

**EDIT** Extra details: Ideally I'd like something with night sights on it, but it's not a deal breaker if it doesn't have that.


**2nd Edit** More items! Pictures [here](http://imgur.com/a/8H2Rs).

As I mentioned, I have a traditional style longbow with a 35lb draw weight. It has been kept dry inside for the majority of its life. The only time I had it out was a weekend here or there for an event, and never in the rain. It's linen backed with a wrapped handle.

I also have a polearm, or specifically, a glave! Also in great condition. The thing is 5 feet 7 inches in length.

And lastly, I have a **.77 caliber black powder handgonne**. It's a working replica of an early style gun. I usually used 70 grains of FFF powder in it. You need matchcord to fire the thing. I painted over it black to help protect it from rust, and put it on a oak stock. It has steel bands around the barrel to keep it tightly secured to the stock.

**EDIT 3** More items:

[Viking belt](http://imgur.com/a/Esk9M) (60 inches total) with decorative brass buckle ($35)

[POS beat up old sword](http://imgur.com/a/VPFvu) ($5)

Clarksville/Nashville TN Area

This is a C93 HK clone ""Pistol"" chambered in 5.56, with 2 original 40 round steel mags, 1 point sling, railed handguard installed (not common), original smooth handguard, owners manual, original box, and 50 rounds of 55GR 5.56 from Freedom Munitions.

This ""pistol"" is perfectly fine in it's current state with the one point sling attached to the rear butt cap, but can also be easily converted into a SBR (NFA rules apply) by simply replacing the buttcap with a collapsible or folding stock. One side of the magwell is mostly blank and would be perfect to get engraved for SBR purposes. I originally purchased it for the purpose of converting it but changed my mind.

I am looking to sell my lightly used Romanian PSL-54C. I am not the original owner but I have taken it the range  a couple times and shot no more than 60 rounds through it. The wood on it is nice and shiny with no real imperfections that I can see. The blueing on it looks good and there aren't any noticeable scratches, minor if any from its short trips to the range. The dustcover is probably the only item that looks like it may be imperfect since its a little dinged up from constant opening and cleaning (not sure why the Romanians made such a dinky dust cover). Overall its in good condition.

When I got the 8x scope, The previous owner said the bulb or battery was out so I never got a chance to try the illuminated portion of the reticle, but it worked fine for me without it. 

Breakdown:

Romanian PSL-54C , Made in Cugir Romania
Threaded Barrel with detent pin and removable Flash Suppressor
Belarus 8x POSP Illuminated Scope
PSL Sling
3 10 Rd PSL Magazines  (1 of the three has a little rust putting in a couple small spots at one time, doesn't affect it)
Harris Bipod Adapter
UTG Bipod
UTG AK Buttpad

Hey guys, my father's having some health problems so I have to liquidate part of my collection. First to go unfortunately is my safe queen and favorite rifle, my Tula AKS-74UN. It has ~150 rounds through it. Here's the specs:


- 74uLLC Receiver with Cyrillic selector markings, including full auto cut
- Bluejack v3.5 barrel with 1:6 twist rate
- Tula 1986 AKS-74U kit
- Gunsmithing and Building by Jayson Cotter at Investment Grade Firearms. This included the Envirotech finish
- Russian Improved MTK-03 side rail
- IGF Fake Can for those not wanting an NFA item. It has been blind pinned and includes the original booster, so if you want to SBR it, you can simply grind off the weld, pop the pin out, and put the booster on



It also includes the following items and add-ons:


- Russian Zenitco B-12 and B-11 handguard set. This is one of two sets in the United States
- Two 30 round Circle 25 magazines and one Circle 10 45 round magazine
- Bulgarian Peep Sight top cover from K-Var Corp
- RS Regulate AK-300 full side mount with AK-R picatinny rail attachment

I would like to get *$2150 OBO* shipped for all of this, well under what I paid to build it. This is about as good of an AKS-74U as it gets. I'm incredibly sad to sell it, but I would like my father to live a little longer.

Roughly ~500 rounds fired, maintained with regular cleaning and lubing with [FireClean.](http://www.cleanergun.com/Testimonials.html)

Started as the standard configuration. Then added a Midwest industries free float barrel, YHM muzzle brake, Ergo Suregrip, tac light, MBUS, Tapco endplate sling adapter, and BAD lever.

Specific gunsmithing was done to cut down and polish down the existing front sight to avoid any potential gas feed issues associated with replacing the A2 sight with a new low-profile sight. The gas block is still original, pins never removed.

Full spec sheet:


* M&amp;P upper, lower, barrel
* Tapco endplate mount
* Ergo suregrip
* MI SS Gen 2 12'' handguard
* YHM 5M1 brake
* Bushnell TRS-25
* Extended Magpul buttpad

I was originally trying for 1450 on Armslist, I realize now that's a bit lofty. **Asking $1350 initially but we can talk about price.** 
I can throw in 4 G2 PMAGs, 3 of which have ranger floorplates, and 60 rounds of Lake City green tip 5.56 if that sweetens the deal for you, depending on price.

He had purchased this weapon himself, but it was allowed to be carried as his sidearm, which is where he picked up the military issue magazine with lanyard loop.

Everything about this weapon is original, and the weapon itself is in excellent condition.  It is being sold WITH an original 1911 military issue magazine, as well as two original standard 1911 magazines.  The slide spring is still in excellent condition, since I keep a different spring in there to prevent spring retention loss.  You can see pics [here](http://imgur.com/a/ULFuk).  Asking $3500.

**Rifle sold, post marked complete**



I've come on some bumpy times financially and need to make ends meet. So sadly today I am putting this M1 Carbine up for sale. 

[PICTURES HERE](http://imgur.com/a/MGsrq)

Details:

This rifle is an Israel Arms International model, produced sometime between 1996 and 2003. I bought the rifle with no sling or accessories, instead of a rear sight it had a rail and cheap scope which I have removed. It has a metal heatguard that can be easily replaced with the classic wooden one. Since buying this rifle, I have added the following:

* Flip Sight: $30
* 15-Round Mag Pouch: $30
* Oiler and Sling: $15
* 15-Round Magazines: 3 Korean-made (2 marked ""U"", 1 marked ""SY-B"", $20 each, $60 total
* 30-Round Magainzes: 2 Korean-made (Both marked UU) $25 each, $50 total
* Bayonet: $20

I have fired approximately 300 rounds from this rifle and it's been a joy. The only failures I've had were with steel case ammunition, it seems to prefer brass. Does well with FMJ and Soft Point rounds though. Great for a beginner rifle, plinking, small to medium game hunting, home defense, or reenacting if you're so inclined. 

For the rifle and all accessories I am asking $600. I live in the Belltown area of Seattle.  ",WA,True,,t5_2sdvv,1374887468.0,wshn,,True,t3_1irko0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunsforsale/comments/1irko0/wts_m1_carbine_with_accessories_in_seattle_wa/,

Model: 1944 M44 Carbine  
Caliber: 7.62x54R  
Location (city or county): SF Bay Area  
Price: $275 FTF  
  
Manufactured in 1944  
Not counter-bored.  
Strong rifling, shiny bore (needs cleaned).  
Still packed in cosmoline.  
Matching numbers EXCEPT a force-matched bottom metal.  
Includes:  
- Side-folding bayonet (attached)  
- Oil can  
- Cleaning rod (attached)  
- Cleaning kit  
I don't have any slings or ammo, sorry.  
  
~~There is a fitment issue with the side-folding bayonet that came with the rifle. For some reason, the locking collar fits a bit too tightly and doesn't allow for proper operation. For that reason, the bayonet will not come attached to the rifle. I'll leave it up to the new owner to be a project of their own.~~  
**Edit:** I've contacted AIM about the fitment issue. It's possible they sent me the wrong collar and that they'll replace it with one that fits correctly.  
**Edit:** AIM is sending me a new collar that should fix this issue.  
**Edit:** The new collar arrived today. Everything fits and works as expected.

Included I'm throwing in 60 rounds of surplus ammo and a pair of stripper clips.( The rubber buttpad has been moved to the T53 so the original buttplate has been returned). Comes with bayonet and the typical accessories, I'm in Rochester NY if anyone is looking to avoid shipping, etc.

Bluing was in pretty poor condition so it's been stripped down to white and given a clear matte finish to keep from rusting, etc. Can easily be re-blued if desired. Purely an aesthetics choice to match the blonde laminate on the stock. If you're a purist you'll hate it, if you like the look you'll love it in person.

Shipped with case $470

Reason shipped w/case is more is because the case is a beast, and the box must be a lot bigger to accommodate it.

[Smith and Wesson 1911](http://imgur.com/a/UtdjH)-$800 

Round count is about 250. I am the only person to shoot it, although I did not buy it new. My neighbor kept it as his home defense backup weapon but never shot it. I carried it for about a year, so it does show some wear on the backstrap safety. The spring is VERY heavy and so is the slide, so it has about 25% the recoil a glock or springfield has even in a smaller caliber. 


~~[2 Chip McCormick Power 10 magazines .45 1911](http://imgur.com/a/NYQnm)-$20 each~~ 

Rounds were not stored in these so the spring is in perfect shape. I used these at the range to reduce reloading time. 


~~[5 Chip McCormick Shooting Stars Magazines .45 1911](http://imgur.com/a/SktNj)-$15 each~~

8 round, with removable base plates.

These magazines are unused, never loaded, but you can see marks on the bodies where they have rubbed up against each other. I took pics of all the markings, up to you to determine ban or pre-ban or whether legal for you to have them.


[2 Scopes - BSA Sweet 22 3-9x40mm IR](http://i.imgur.com/tF815.jpg)
Need to update this. Just realized there are many versions of the sweet 22. will do tonight when I get home.

UPDATE: This is a BSA Sweet 22 3-9x40mmIR (illuminated reticle). It is brand new, just opened the box to take this pic. I found underneath the scope in the box instructions, a lens cleaner, and replacement battery. This scope automatically adjusts trajectory on 36, 38, and 40 grain .22LR rounds. To do this, you need to plug in the right distance. It is illuminated green reticle, shock proof, water-proof, and fog-proof. Cheapest I have found the IR version online is $109. $95 shipped, selling 2 of them.


~~[Newer wolf ammo .223 20 round box](http://imgur.com/a/2i0IU)-$4.50 a box, 18 boxes~~

55 grain full metal jacket, steel cased, boxer primed, polymer coated. Before this becomes a thread about the validity of Wolf ammo, allow me to clear some things up. Older wolf ammo got a bad rep because they lacquer coated the rounds, causing barrels and parts to get gummed up. Acetone was the cure for that. Wolf has switched from lacquer coating to polymer because of the lack of sales or some other irrelevant reason. 

The bad now - it is steel cased, so if you use it in an M4 you may experience FTE, since the steel does not expand like brass. Up to you to decide if it is worth it. Also, it is really dirty. I mean like, you don't want to fire more than 400 rounds or so, that is when mine started to smoke pretty bad. Also, in an AR, you wont want to dry fire this or lubricate the bolt too much, results in lots of smoke and teary eyes.

The good - 22 cents a round. just requires a little more attention on your part. Polymer coated, VERY accurate. I have only been able to fire it out to 300 yards, no less competent than Federal.


~~[Wolf Military classic .223 20 round box](http://imgur.com/a/WMBeD)- $4.50 a box, 15 boxes~~

I think it is exactly the same ammo as above. Same FPS, muzzle velocity, and grain. Looks like Wolf tried some new packaging.

I'm looking to sell a gently-used CZ-75B in .40S&amp;W with the satin nickel finish. It's a fantastic pistol (the finish is 100%) and I'm only selling it because I'm not a fan of .40S&amp;W and I've already replaced it with a CZ-85 Combat. It's had 108 rounds through it. Comes with two factory 10 round magazines, all documentation (manual, warranty book, unfilled warranty registration card and factory test target), and unused cleaning rod/brush. Missing the fired casing (might be able to locate it, though). 

Asking price: $500 OBO cash or money order, FTF in Northern Virginia with CCW permit or shipped to an FFL (see below).

Also looking to sell a police trade-in H&amp;K USP in .40S&amp;W. Again, great pistol, just not for me. Manufactured in '94 and imported through Sterling, VA. Comes with two 13 round magazines (one of which is a ""restricted"" post-ban magazine, pictured). It has some holster wear, so I'd estimate the finish to be between 85% and 90%. I've put around 25 rounds through it, with an unknown number before that. 

Asking price: $450 OBO cash or money order, FTF in Northern Virginia with CCW permit, or shipped to an FFL (see below).

I'm asking $450 for the handgun with one 10 round magazine and five 15 rounders. Will trade for a GLOCK 36 and may consider trade for other (sub)compact .45 ACP handguns.

Prefer face to face transaction, but can ship through FFL if necessary.

Also be aware, this is not a gun for people with tiny hands. It's not the ""2x4 for a grip"" that a Glock 21 has, but still pretty big. The Hogue Grip makes it more manageable.

* Tromix bolt handle
* CSS axis pin retaining plate
* An extra, low-power spring for low brass ""bulk"" birdshot (also CSS)

* Mesa Tactical rear sling swivel (meant for an 870 but fit perfectly)
* Promag 10rd magazine (gen. 2, but they sent me the wrong replacement spring, so it's yours free)

Included: 
1 Magazine 
PSO LPS TIP2 4x Scope 
Leather Sling 

Price: Asking $825 Shipped to your FFL in CONUS or ONLY trade for a similar value VEPR 23"" chambered in 7.62 x 54R 

Method of Payment: Payment by CASH or US Postal money order only. Will ship from my FFL to your FFL including a bill of sale. 

Info: 
I've had this gun for a few months now and have taken in to the range a handful of times. The gun is by no means a safe queen, and does have the typical wear for a used gun. Scope is bright and clear and includes both front and rear rubber covers. As far as I know the leather sling is the genuine one that it came with. I bought the rifle from the second owner and now I have to sell it. It's a great gun and I hate to see it go, but I'll eventually get another one down the road. Please let me know if you have any questions via IM.

I'm sort of new here but I can provide a link to feedback from ebay with over 400 positive transactions.

*  ""Accurate"" for a Mosin

*  Good bore (see above)

*  Round receiver

Stock condition is also unimportant since I will be replacing it (if it doesn't have a stock, I'll still take it).  Stockless would almost be preferred since I don't really want an extra laying around.  I will also be in no need of a bayonet.

I have a nice Remington 1100 Trap model shotgun. Everything on the gun is original as it came out of the factory in April of 1978 (according to the barrel stamp). It has BOTH the 30 inch factory step rib barrel (fixed full) and monte carlo stock. The gun is in great shape, and being an older Remington, the fit and finish is excellent.  I have two 1100's, and the other one (also my first shotgun) just gets used more for trap.  $650

As far as trades go, I would be interested in Model 1903's or a nice Model 1917 (not sporterized). I would also be interested in a .410 Shotgun for skeet and a .410 reloading press. Cash can go either way depending on the trade.  A nice 357 revolver would be cool too. I'll entertain all trade offers!

This is Serial Number 16 of the special Cabela's Edition of the Witness 45 ACP / 22lr combo.  The gun is in a special brown (FDE) version of their ""Wonderfinish"", and as far as I can tell is otherwise the same as other Steel Full-size Witness 45's.

This gun is clean as a whistle (I have an ultrasonic cleaner and take extremely good care of my guns) and shoots just fine.  I am selling it because I got a MKIII hunter and I'm TRYING to buy a FNX 45 Tactical, so I'm making room in the safe.

Comes with:

* FDE full sized steel frame (Serial number is CAB0016)

* FDE .45 ACP complete slide

* Black .22lr complete slide

* 3x 10rd factory magazines in 45ACP

* 1x 10rd factory magazine in .22lr

* Complete box with original papers, bags, and cleaning rods

Condition of the gun is like new, 99%, save some light barrel wear.  This gun has seen maybe 200rds of 45, and not sure about the 22, but more.  The cleanliness of this gun will surprise you.  Always kept in humidity controlled safe, and always cleaned and lubed, and occasionally cleaned with my ultrasonic.

Everything is stock on this gun.  The 45 slide was replaced by the factory recently and it has not been shot since, so new springs and slide guts are assumed.  Barrel is original.

Asking $500, FTF in WA preferred.  I'd rather not ship, but will consider it.  Located in the south Puget Sound area.

Trades I'll entertain:

* Sub2000 in .40 with Glock mags

* Sig P938

* Mossberg MVP

* Kel-Kec KSG

* toward a FNX 45 Tac FDE

* Taurus PT100 or PT101 in SS

*As a side note, if you have a P938 for trade, I have a Sig P238 I would trade you for it, plus a little cash*

Centurion Arms CHF, chrome lined, 16"" mid length barrel, 1:7 twist, 5.56 chamber

Rainier Arms/Sampson Floating handguard w/ extra rail mounts

Rainier Arms Forged Upper

Rainier Arms Thunderbolt BCG

Stag low profile gas block

Front- Troy fixed battle sight

Rear- NcStar A2-style


EXTRAS:

2x 20 round pmag

1x 30 round pmag

There have been only 220 rounds shot through this. I just finished the build in May. Took it out for a run and loved it. But haven't shot it since and there are other things I want to spend money on. I have roughly $1500 into this rifle with the extras. So my loss is your gain.


You can get a ton of info on most of the components at the Rainier Arms website. Rest assured, it's a good quality build. You will not be disappointed.

Brand new. Never fired. I bought to make a SBR project and am unable to finish. I have a faux suppressor on order so that this can be used (legally) with an HK stock (able to be bolted on with no modification). I will include that with the sale once it arrives.

Comes with 1 brand new factory magazine and 5 lightly used HK magazines. Includes the OEM hard case (and 80 rounds of ammo if local).

This is registered as a pistol and will require an FFL transfer. I will meet within 30 mins of the East Suburbs of Pittsburgh, PA.

**For trade:**  [Remington 700 .308 SPS Tactical AAC-SD](http://i.imgur.com/y18Df.jpg) with the following:

* Bell and Carlson A5 stock

* Millett TRS-1, 30mm, 4-16x 50mm, 1/10 Mil, Green Illuminated Mil-Dot Reticle

* Burris 30mm Xtreme Tactical Rings

* EGW 20 MOA base

* Harris S-BRM 6""-9"" bipod with Alpha Bravo bipod lock

* KRG Bolt Knob

* JP Enterprises Muzzle Brake/Compensator

**Other Notes:**

* I have $1600+ into the gun.

* Approximately 200 rounds down the tube.  I mostly shot handloads (168 &amp; 175 SMK's).

* I can't comment too much on the details of its accuracy as I am/was just a beginner to long-range shooting.  However, I took it out to 440 yards and could hit 6"" diameter balloons fairly easily.  I don't have any exact MOA data.

* I have the original Hogue stock, never used.  I can throw it in with it.  Or if you are wanting to go with a stock other than the B&amp;C, I could install the Hogue and keep the B&amp;C (and lower the price).  I doubt I'd have too much trouble getting rid of the A5 by itself.

* I'm willing to ship.  Contact me about FTF options.  

* I have positive feedback on snipershide.com, ar15.com, and eBay.


**Wanted:**  I am really only interested in a few things, but will listen to and consider all offers.  I'm not really looking for another bolt action rifle or any shotguns, as I'm really more into semi-auto handguns or MAYBE an AR or an AK.  I already have an AR, but will still listen to offers.  While I'll consider many guns, I'd love to find one of the following:

* Desert Eagle, any finish and any of the three calibers.  Seems like this could be close to a straight up trade.
* CZ's.  A CZ 75 of some sort + cash if necessary or I'd love to find a CZ 97B.  If someone has a CZ 75 with the .22 Kadet kit, that would be awesome.
* I would consider a Glock + cash.  Preference would be a standard size or compact and not the subcompacts.
* Beretta 92 with the INOX finish.  I like all 92's, 96's and M9's though.
* Ruger 77/357 or MAYBE a 77/17.
* A nice .22 caliber AR isn't out of the question either.
* I'd also consider a pair of handguns to avoid the ""+ cash"" part, even a pair of Glocks or something like that.  Some other combination might be possible too (like a 22/45 and a CZ-75)

I am looking for the [above stated gun](http://i.imgur.com/B4R1NwA.jpg). I saw one at a local gun store a couple weeks back and absolutely fell in love with it. It just felt *right* in my hands, you know? Anyway, I wasn't sure if I was going to get it, so I went to dinner with a couple friends to think it over. Well, I decided to get it and went back to the gun store, and wouldn't you know it?? It had been sold. :(

The store I visited has been *incredibly* cool with prices since all of this price-hiking stuff has been going on. They had the gun marked at $650, so I'd really like to get it around that price. I am on a waiting list for it at the store, but he is not sure when he will get another in. 

So, if anyone has one that they would like to sell, I'd love to try and set up a deal! I live in Southeast WV, but can travel to other places in the state to meet.

The pistol was not cared for well before it become mine, and is now missing both of the magazines it came with.

I am willing to pay a reasonable price (I understand originals aren't inexpensive, and am willing to spend though)

If anyone has a bead on where I might find these it would also be much appreciated.

I love this gun, but I've got back problems and had to get something lighter for carry.

I've fired about 1,000+/- rounds without a single issue (this is probably much higher than reality, but I thought I should round up rather than down). I also spent way too long polishing the barrel because I hated the way the coating scratched off from the chamber. She has a little bit of holster wear, but she is in great shape.

Package includes:

* XD9 Sub Compact
* 4x 13rd magazines
* 3x 16rd magazines with grip extensions
* original XD Gear (Mag Pouch, Mag Loader, Holster, Lock, Brush)
* 1x additional XD Gear Mag Pouch
* ~~Comp-Tac Infidel IWB Holster with unattached Moleskin (I never bothered putting it on)~~
* Approximately 30 rounds of Winchester NATO Loads

* 13rd magazines - $15 each

I also have the original Beretta stock, manuals and a set of speedloader tubes and pouch. I have *never* used the speedloaders and have no idea if they work with this gun, I think they are intended for the Benelli M1, but good luck with them! I've had about a thousand rounds through this thing and only had one stoppage. It has 3 small nicks on the finish, but overall in great condition.

$600 cash or MO. I would greatly prefer a local sale in the Triad area but can ship to your FFL for $25.

Remington 1100:  This is a 2 3/4"" 12GA 1100 with a bead ""FULL"" barrel cut down to 22"" with a brass bead installed.  It has a Remington factory +2 extension, Ram-line youth synthetic stock set, Remington 1100 Competition Master shell lifter with the big bolt release button, GG&amp;G side sling mount and a Streamlight flashlight mount.  The whole thing (minus the magazine extension tube) was sandblasted, parkerized and painted in Brownells black moly-resin for a tough finish.  The Remington tube was added after I refinished it and is still in bare parkerizing.  Spares included: extra o-ring gas seals, 2 +2 Remington magazine springs, and a spare bolt handle.

The barrel is longer than the extension because I had it cut off even with the Choate magazine extension it was wearing previously, which was replaced because it was cheap and crappy.

Gun runs great, a soft recoiling tubular claymore that tightly patterns buckshot.

For an additional $150 I can include a 1100 2 3/4"" 26"" VR MOD barrel that was also parkerized and painted in grey moly-resin, plus a kind of beat Remington wood stock set, a standard length magazine spring and a stock magazine tube spring cap.  Two guns for the price of 1.25!

**Mid length and carbine length hand guards:** Both are like new, with no packaging; the carbine length ones came off an RRA, the mid length from a CMMG. Both of them have heat shields. **$15 OBO shipped for either pair**

I don't give a shit how old it is.

I don't give a shit if the barrel is shot out, bent, has a bad crown, whatever.

I don't give a shit what shape the furniture is in.

All I care about is that the receiver is serviceable, because that's all I intend to use.

Since all I care about is the receiver, I can't justify buying a brand new rifle from one of my distributors and stripping it.

And I haven't had any true beaters come into my shop lately.

The price range I'm looking at is maybe 30-40 bucks (plus shipping, of course), tops.

So if you have a beater 10/22 collecting dust in your garage or under your pickup seat, and want to make a quick buck, send me a PM and let's do this shit.

Looking to get rid of my Px4 9mm. Originally bought it because I bought a Cx4 and loved it, thought it'd be cool to own the family. Never really shot it but once or twice. Decent gun, just don't need a 3rd 9mm handgun. I recently bought a M&amp;P .40c for daily carry and love the platform and I want the fullsize. Something's gotta go, Px4 it is. 

Comes with:

 * 2 mags (willing to throw in another if need be)
 * 3 Holsters : Comp-tac MTAC IWB Holster, Blackhawk serpa retention holster, Safariland thumbswitch retention paddle holster. 
 * Box with manuals, lock, cleaning kit
 *Weird cylinder thing in the box that appears to serve no purpose but bear the Beretta logo and keep the box from getting squished. 


Can throw in rounds or cash to sweeten trade for .40 VTAC

Willing to trade for M&amp;P full size .40 or sell the whole package for $550. Selling piece by piece would be kind of annoying.  FTF in Western Washington only at this point.
