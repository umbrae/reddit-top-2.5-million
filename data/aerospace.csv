I'm looking into studying with the ADFA (Australian Defence Force Academy) largely because huge amounts of alleviated stress concerning fees, living costs and the such.

So my question is: What do you do in your job? It's a huge question for me, because I would absolutely love to be a job where I was directly working on aircraft (helis especially) in a mechanical or design aspect, or flying around in them (though I'm short sighted, so the odds aren't good).

Basically, I would absolutely loathe to be sitting behind a desk all day directing people, or thinking about some completely boring but probably terribly important aspect of flying; I'd much rather get down and dirty with an engine or maintain aircraft, or design parts or engines to be more efficient/faster/stronger.

For my year 12 subjects, I'll be studying physics, chemistry, english, systems engineering and all three levels of maths from low level to high level. I'm no dummy by any means, and do very well academically, so it's not a huge issue in that department.
I'm wondering whether any of you can tell me about what you do or give me advice on what career path I should perhaps focus on instead, whether it be mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering, I really don't know.

I have been hovering around here for a month or so now, asking questions here or there when they occur to me, and certainly getting useful feedback, but I feel like it is taking too long to really get a grasp of where I might fit in best in the industry. I am a complex individual, and on the surface the industry seems to be geared towards a fairly narrow range of personality types. I feel like it would be best to just describe myself and my misgivings a bit, and get your honest opinions about where I would fit in. So if anyone has the bandwidth and the will, please read:

I am a 26-year-old male software engineer. I received my BS in Computer Engineering in 2010, and shortly thereafter began working in web development. Web development is very lucrative - I can make a great deal of money in this field if I choose to pursue it - but it is not very technically challenging. I do not need to know calculus. I do not need to know physics. I do not need to know how to design high-performance algorithms. All I really need is a working knowledge of Ruby on Rails and I am golden.

I am a good engineer and I would like to work on more challenging projects. For me, since I also seek that nebulous thing called ""purpose"", space travel is the obvious front-runner.

The people who have worked with me express a great deal of appreciation not only for my commitment to well-designed, well-built, and well-tested software, but also my abilities as a communicator and synthesizer - ""team skills"" that can sometimes be shortfalls for specialists and engineers.

The companies I am most interested in working for, such as SpaceX, Bigelow, Blue Origin, appear to have frankly awful work/life balance. In fact, I have all but written these companies off at this point. It would be great to be that kind of engineer, but I know myself better than that. I am a complex person and I need time for arts, exercise, socializing, and sleep in my life, or I will probably fall into depression. It is my personal philosophy that there is no point doing something, however great, if it is going to make you miserable.

However those companies are the ones doing the things I want to do, which is why working for NASA or a big contractor gives me some pause as well. My impression is that these organizations represent the ""old guard"" in a way - they are in the business of serving the present state of space travel operations, whereas ""NewSpace"" is all about the future of space travel. And of course, the large contractors also do a great deal of defense work, which I want to avoid.

Are these general assumptions correct or am I completely misguided here?

Are there other options out there I am not thinking of? For example, are there any small independent/experimental projects that might be able to pay me a basic living wage to do work for them? Does such a thing exist?

Where do you think I might fit in best?

Does anyone have any suggestions for things I should think about? Please don't be afraid to speak up if you think I won't like what you have to say. Honest opinions from people with first-hand knowledge is the most valuable thing anyone can give me right now. Life involves a lot of tough decisions and sacrifice and I am prepared for that. But it never hurts to have the best information one can get before making those tough choices!

Thanks in advance for any and all help!


**EDIT**: Many people are pointing out that only having web dev experience and Ruby proficiency is not going to serve me very well. Let me address this. First off, I am currently pursuing the following activities to develop more relevant skills:

- C++ (I am in the beginning stages of my first small C++ project)

- Embedded Systems (I intend to purchase an Arduino and possibly one of those small hacker's quadcopters.)

- Robotics (I am currently enrolled in a control theory course on Coursera.)

In addition, as was pointed out, a lot of programming theory is universal and transferrable between languages. In my career so far I have been very adamant about taking the time to do proper object-oriented design, and developing my instinct for correct encapsulation and separation of concerns. In an interview where theory questions are asked, I believe I would do okay.

Of course, feel free to comment on this stuff as well!",,False,,t5_2qirz,1360734576.0,,,True,t3_18eb0y,http://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/18eb0y/alright_you_space_engineers_i_need_your_honest/,

I have been working at a defense contractor near my school for a year now and before that I worked at a defense sub-contractor. So I do believe I have great experience for my age above my peers who are graduating with me.

With that being sad, I am still nervous about the SpaceX interview. 

What are some key bullet points to keep in mind during my interview coming up?

What are some topics I should keep to and not stray away from?

What questions would be good to ask to show my interest and show I want to be a part of there company?

I have interviewed with many other companies recently but this one has more weight to it I believe.

Please, any guidance and or input would be great!

I spoke with an acquaintance in the industry who advised me (after finding out my initial resume was horrible) to stick with pursuing a job in aero propulsion.  I have been applying since December 2012 with the new resume with NO results.  In the past 2 months or so I have even applied to a few local general engineering jobs in an effort to actually find a job.

My question is am I even hirable after nearly 1 and a third years of ""stagnation""? Would the only option for an actual aero career path be to go for a masters degree?  Any advice is appreciated.

I'm an upcoming Sophomore and I plan on getting a degree in Aerospace. Since my school is relatively small (approximately 1200 in my graduating class), in order to pursue Aerospace, I need to major in Mechanical and minor in Aerospace. I also have an interest in Electrical engineering as well. My advisor suggested that I include a minor in Electrical and go on to graduate school to get a Masters in Electrical. According to him, it would make me extremely marketable. My question is: how much of a difference would the addition of a Masters in EE make?

Having just completed my Freshman year, I have time before these decisions need to be made. I'm just trying to get as many opinions as possible to make an informed decision when the time comes. Luckily, I live in New Jersey, which makes my life a little easier for my future job search.

A family friend was able to hire me at a company where they are a principle, doing land surveying.  I am not particularly interested in surveying, nor do I find it challenging.

  Recently an offer came up for me to get some professional certificates at my current company, at their expense.  These will probably come with raises (which I'm making well under what I hope I would be making upon graduation) and possibly a transfer to a salary position.  The problem is they of course want a commitment for at least a ""few years.""

If I don't take this offer, I will be stuck at my lower paying grunt work job.

As an enthusiast I've more or less eaten up the dick and jane stuff for Sunday book browsers and want something more in depth.

Right now I have a BSc in software development &amp; IT, an MSc in Intelligent Systems, and a few years of experience in software dev' in telecoms and medical devices.

My question: How important is knowledge of the ""harder"" parts of aeronautics and space (flight dynamics, physics, ...) for working in the field? Enough to justify going back to university for a few years?

Subsidiary question: Seen how many job opportunities are directed at electrical engineers, is there a chance for a software person to work on something interesting? (I do not intend to go for an EE degree!)

(advantages and applications)",13,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/1gpfzd/oblique_vs_swing_wing_advantages_and_applications/,"I was discussing earlier the function of an oblique wing, such as that found on the [NASA AD-1](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-019-DFRC.html) when the question of what the actual use of an oblique (rotating) wing was. The answer I was able to find was that it was essentially an alternative to the variable sweep ""swing wing"" found on something like an F-14 ([Tomcat](http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=1100&amp;tid=1100&amp;ct=1)), which provides a larger planform area for high lift at subsonic speeds, but then changes geometry to lower drag at transonic and supersonic regimes. My understanding is that they're basically two ways of accomplishing the same end goal.

I guess my question is this: was there really any practical advantage to an oblique wing, or was it basically just another experimental approach, a sort of ""second solution?""

I've had a read around but haven't been able to find much information which doesn't assume you already know a fair bit in this field.

I am currently a student of International Business and I am interested in pursuing a career in supply chain management &amp; procurement. I am currently exploring my research topic. Since I am new and not too familiar with the aerospace industry, I was wondering if some people here could possibly answer a few questions I had or even add something helpful/relevant?

1. I understand the benefits of competition and the risk mitigation factors, but is it uncommon for aerospace companies to competitively source [strategic?] components between two companies? 

2. The 787 supports 2 different engines (Trent 1000 and GEnx). The A380 supports two different engines as well. Do customers, like airlines, choose the set of engines from Boeing or do they order from the engine company?

3. How does a company like Boeing or Airbus choose to source an engine with a particular company? I know that may be a long or, perhaps, unanswerable question. Why, in the case of engines, do they choose two companies and not three?

I would greatly appreciate any responses as this is almost completely new to me! Any resources are helpful as well. You can simply write me a comment or send me a message as well.

Hello [/r/aerospace](/r/aerospace) folks! This is going to be largely a self-plug, but I hope you'll be interested in what I'm trying to do here; If you feel this isn't suited for this subreddit, feel free to just nuke it from orbit. I thank you for your time and patience, and I wish you all the best whatever happens. I can't wait for the day when we can all go to LEO and beyond.




So, Metro newspaper is hosting a competition where the winner gets a ride to Low Earth Orbit by the space tourism company SXC.

Needless to say, I, as a space enthusiast and generally sane person signed up in a jiffy, but I need your votes to win!

You may ask, why would you want me to win? Simply put, besides being an enthusiast and a redditor, **I hope to go up there with a HD-video camera and capture some footage from orbit, and then bring it down for all to see on YouTube!This footage, I believe, should contain a slip of paper with a picture of the reddit alien, floating serenely in microgravity. Never mind putting Reddit on the map, we'll put it into space!**


The regional competition closes on 25.3.2012, which is in a mere two days. However, as long as one is a member of the top vote gatherers (#1 is at 10 000 votes right now), they get presented to a committee that makes the decision who gets selected for the final competition. That part is all up to me, and I will do my utmost to be charismatic and win that for us.


I'll also be taking any suggestions you might have that could be realistically be realized within the constraints of a commercial spaceflight company; I'm not certain about the video, but I will honestly do anything in my power to make it happen;* However, we won't even have a chance for that if I don't at least pass the preliminaries!*** Let's show the power of reddit and make the impossible happen! Click on the below link, and share this with your friends!**


With as much personal humility as I can muster while asking for such a big opportunity, I ask you, please vote for me and maybe even click on the facebook ""like"" button in [THIS LINK](http://metroinspace.com/fi/view/ctjg/Avaruus_on_meille_kaikille) The text is in finnish, but the vote button is the yellow Äänestä button, and of course you recognize the facebook thumbs up.


Below is the short blurp I wrote for the page, translated into english:
Private Space industry provides us something we've never had: A democratic access to the stars, our origin. I don't want to be a part of a one percent that gets to see the beauty of our home planet; I don't want to be a part of a small elite that basks in the beauty of the stars and the universe itself. I want everyone to have a chance to go up there, someday. Someday that will happen, and though I cannot offer that to you, we can bring that future into fruition. The winner of this competition goes to the stars in our stead, until such a day when we can all do the same. If you choose me to be that representative, I will to the best of my ability try to bring back HD-video for all to see, and I will share as much as I can about what I saw and felt, until such a day until you can experience the same. I have from an early age tried to understand the world and its incredible beauty in any way possible, and through science my love for space and rockets awoke before I even went to school, but absurdly enough I am too tall to ever be an astronaut.

For the last one, we are supposed to propose a theme. 

We have to make a static stress analysis as well as a modal analysis of some mechanical part or structure using the finite element program Ansys. This part or structure cannot be ""very simple"" because the professor wants us to learn to mesh properly but a ""very hard"" subject would be inappropriate because i'm planning on it being a two weeks work project (approx 4 hours/day).  

The thing is, I would really like to work on some aerospace industry part rather than something else but i have no connections with any aerospace enterprise.

I have been told that Latex is not good for group projects, but I disagree. If two or more people understand Latex well enough, I think the ""programming-esque"" structure is better suited for group work.

I'm about to graduate from a large engineering university with my bachelors in aerospace engineering.  At our school in your junior/senior year you split, and I chose space.  I have taken astromechanics and spacecraft stability.  All that good stuff.

I haven't had to much luck with internships, and at our school all you hear from engineering fairs is ""Apply online!""

So, what I am looking for as I am about to graduate is advice for landing my first job; how I should present myself, interview tips, or getting an interview at all.  I feel like I must be doing something wrong, cause some of the people around me who I know aren't the brightest colleagues are getting interviews.

Or perhaps, by some miracle, someone who might be looking for a new employee at work and is looking in unorthodox places.

I'm not gonna put all my credentials on here, if there is someone looking, than I'll give it to em.

&gt;I'm in St. Louis, Missouri, and I'd like to keep my travel time/expense to a minimum. That said, I'd like to do it right and see the most awesome rocket launch that I can, and see it in the best possible way.

&gt;**I'm currently making the following assumptions. Please feel free to correct them; they may very likely be wrong**:

&gt;* If I want to watch a launch in the Continental U.S., I must choose between [Cape Canaveral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station) in Florida and [Vandenberg Air Force Base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base) in California.
&gt;* The launch platforms I have to choose from are: [Minotaur I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur_%28rocket%29), [Taurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_%28rocket%29), [Atlas V](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V), ~~Delta II~~, [Delta IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_IV), and ~~the Space Shuttle~~.
&gt;* This wikipedia [list of 2012 launches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_in_spaceflight) contains a full and complete listing of (U.S., continental) launches that will happen this year.

&gt;I have no preference for manned vs. unmanned, and am not favoring launches with any historical import – I am only wanting to see the most visually impressive launch that I can.

&gt;Am I correct in assuming that I want to be as close as is possible? NASA provides [instructions on good public viewing positions](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/viewing.html), but I'd like to be closer, if possible. (Ideally, I'd love a view like [this one](http://www.launchphotography.com/GLAST_2.jpg) if possible.) Who do I schmooze in order to get the best seats in the house? (I'm guessing that the CEO of *SatelliteMegaCorp* isn't watching the launch with binoculars from his pickup bed on the state highway...) Could choosing a poorly-attended launch help my chances of getting closer? Do different launch providers have different policies on this?

&gt;What are the differences in appearance of the various launch platforms? Is bigger better? If so, what's the closest-modern-equivalent to the Saturn V? Are launches to [GTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_transfer_orbit) *cooler looking* than launches to [LEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit)? (Forgive all of this if they are foolish questions... I have no idea).

&gt;What am I not asking that I should be? I know there must be an enthusiast community for such things (kindred spirits to Railfans and Roadgeeks), but I'm not finding any online.

Space, Astronomy, Spaceflight, etc. I wanted to study in that direction so bad when I first went to college, but I let other things get in the way to helped me to drop my dreams by the wayside.

I want to work in the space industry. I'm not sure exactly as what, but it is something I strongly believe in. Lately I've been looking at Aerospace ENgineer or Astronomer/Astrophysicist.

My college work is from 20 years ago, so I figure I'd be starting all over. I've done some searching, enough to know that I'd need to really do some studying in math to get up to speed, and I'm okay with that.

The problem is, I struggled to get through almost every engineering-specific class I took, with the exception of a select few that I was extremely interested in (mostly related to propulsion). I would have switched majors, but I have never wanted to work in any other field, anything else would be giving up on my dreams, and therefore, life. I looked into internships, but when the summers came around, I ended up staying in summer-school to help me graduate without putting myself and my family into a crushing amount of debt. As a result, I haven't had any internships within the industry, and I'm finding out now, that companies won't give them to you unless you're actively enrolled in school.

I graduated with a GPA of 2.04, and have been living at home in a state with zero aerospace opportunities, saddled with insane amounts of out-of-state debt, working for a paltry $11/hr doing retail completely unrelated aerospace, for over two years now. I've been looking, and networking, even spending the little I can afford to go to aerospace conferences to network, and hopefully try to find someone within the industry who will give me a chance. 

I've known since the beginning of my sophomore year that my grades weren't going to be my strong point and spent the rest of my college life doing everything I could to make up for that. For four years I was on a team that worked to develop a rocket entirely under sparse sponsorship funding with the end goal of making it past the Kármán line, I've designed components from the ground up, analyzed failures, made significant advances in total integration, and redesigned entire systems, all as a part of an extra curricular activity. I was even the team leader of my senior design project. I stand behind the fact that even in comparison to my peers who had far better GPA's than me, I have hands on experience that was invaluable to my understanding of aerospace and its application far above what they learned in school.

So here is what is going on for me, 2 years out of school. Last December (2011) (1 yr, 4 mo out of school), I ordered 10 grams of synthetic cannabis online wanting to try it as I had been abstaining from any substance due to drug testing in the industry. I had smoked natural cannabis while I was in school, mostly on weekends, and some nights after class as a way to relieve stress and anxiety from all the pressure.

A short synopsis of what happened next:
The Department of Homeland security intercepted my shipment in December (before the substance I ordered was actually illegal), and held onto it until January (once it was made illegal). Right before February, the local police executed a controlled delivery and subsequently a ""no-knock"" search warrant on my home where I was living with my father. Thankfully I was the only person home, but I had 5-6 police officers pointing loaded weapons at my head with 3 of them screaming conflicting instructions at me. I'm lucky as hell to be alive.

After several months of legal battles with a privately hired lawyer (I would have been *completely* screwed with a public defender), I am now on a program referred to as ""first-offender probation"".

The way things stand now, as long as I make it through these two years, my record is sealed (not expunged). Apparently, they made synthetic cannabis a felony as apposed to a misdemeanor (it took months of negotiation to even avoid 3 months of jail). For a while, I faced a 1-3 year sentence.

Regardless, my situation at the moment is untenable. My father lives with his girlfriend and son, and is constantly quick to anger over minor problems, thereby causing me anxiety-attack inducing stress. I need to be able to afford to live on my own, and soon.



Right now, I have stopped applying for aerospace jobs. If a company does a background check on you and finds out you're a felon, there is absolutely no legal recourse for you to have that removed from their private system. Publicly, It's a sealed record, but before it's sealed, the company can save your record in a database and forever prevent you from doing what you love.


So, after the most long-winded explanation ever (there are still more details), here is where I'm at.






A Place in my hometown is extremely interested in hiring me, I've got a really good shot at getting this position because it's a family company, and one of the two owners has been in a situation very similar to mine. The problem is, this company is entirely unrelated to aerospace, and I'm not sure how I would ever get back to aircraft/spacecraft design after the 3-5 years I would owe them. The starting pay is ~40k and currently that is 2-3 times what I make with my hourly salary over a year. It would be enough I could at least move out of my fathers house and start a life of my own.

My major conflict however, is the person I have been speaking to at a major aerospace company for the last two years. This is the one networking connection that I can say has gone extremely well, and he has recently been placed at the head of a hiring committee for said aerospace company. We have a good relationship, but my worry is that if I tell him everything that has happened, it will ruin it. At the same time, however, if I tell him, he could be the person who gives me the chance I need.

What I am worried about, is if he selects me as someone who he wants for the position the company will certainly do a background check, and the company will have that on file for the rest of my life.

So, after much explanation. Is it better to take a position completely unrelated to your passions with the hope of eventually getting back to what you have always wanted to do. Or is it better to hold out until any legal fuck-ups are behind you and then try to apply again being many years out with just the promise that you will do an excellent job for them.

What should I do?

Tl;Dr: Please just read it, yeah, it's long as hell, but it's the only way to understand the choice I'm looking for input on.


EDIT: Thank you all for your responses and support. I honestly had no clue how this self post would turn out or what I would hear. I really appreciate all of the reassurance that this is not the end of the road for my aspirations.

It's taken a long time to try and get past the initial shock of everything that happened and the ""My life is ruined"" feeling of it all. I've got my last interview with the local company coming up next week. I'm not going to turn down any opportunity at this point.

So I study a group of butterflies that occupies a narrow vertical stratum near the rainforest floor.  I'm exploring the idea that they have adapted to flight in ground effect.  


Now, I've found a lot of the basic information that is out there about Wing-in-Ground Effect, and I have been reading a lot.  Obviously, I can't just directly apply what is known about aircrafts to butterflies with a wingspan of &lt;5cm (right?).  And furthermore, most of the math scares me, so it's not like I'm at the point where I can just pick out what is relevant to my question.  I need to start with a human who can perhaps explain what I'm looking at.  Or tell me what I should be reading first.



I want to use an airfoil simulator with ground effect to procure ""optimal"" wing shapes.  Any ideas of where I should start?  Would I need to build one from scratch, modify an existing one, or is there already one that is perfect and suits my needs?  Do we know enough about small flying things to have a working computer simulation?  


Basically, if you've read this far, and you know anything about what I'm asking, or are just even in the slightest bit interested, I would love to have a conversation.  I want my project to be coherent from a biological perspective, and from an aerodynamic one, I just need to know what that means.  Thanks so much!

1321327274.0,7,self.aerospace,mcm0h,Please help me get into the Aerospace industry. (Any advice is appreciated).,10,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/mcm0h/please_help_me_get_into_the_aerospace_industry/,"Hey I have been trying to figure this out on my own for a long time, and while I knew that Reddit always has great advice for people, I never thought to slap a /r/aerospace on and check it out.

I will be graduating college with a BS in Physics this winter (minor in math), and I am trying my best to get into aerospace but it seems to not be going so well. I had always thought that an undergraduate physics degree would be a good foundation before making the transition, but going up against aerospace engineering undergrads for grad school admission and jobs really has me worried.

Here is my plan: While I have a strong background in experimental research (solid state physics), I am really interested in aerospace applications (particularly plasma science and more specifically I really am interested in the research going on into plasma propulsion). I live in the Seattle area, and am applying to the University of Washington's Aeronautics and Astronautics graduate program (plasma science division), and I am also applying to as many aerospace engineering internships as I can (so far have hit Boeing and Aerojet). I am also applying to Aeronautic scholarships and fellowships because I think it'll make me more attractive of a candidate to UW. It seems more likely, because I have a strong academic and research background, that I will get into UW than get a permanent Aerospace job, but I am trying to apply to those as well, with poor results.

Now I come to you for help, /r/aerospace. Any advice that you have at all would help me out. Advice on how to transition from physics, advice on how to make an appealing resume to big aerospace companies, where to look for good internship opportunities, or where to go to ask these questions if this isn't the right place. I am all ears for any help you care to offer.


Thanks so much for your time!

Duncan Harrison


**Edit:** Thanks so much for all the help! You guys are awesome. All of my advisors/professors are physicists, so they don't know much about the subject, and the professors where I am applying don't really have time to help an applicant too much. It's great to finally hear advice from people within the field. I don't feel quite so lost now.

I am currently involved in a project that involves a lot of modelling of fluid slosh using CFD.  That said, my CFD background is extremely limited (in other words, I once used Fluent to find the lift and drag coefficients of an airfoil).

As such, does anybody have any tips/resources I could use to help learn slosh modelling using CFD?  Also, any ideas on what CFD software would be good to use in this modelling?

I just performed a wind tunnel experiment on a Clark Y-14 airfoil and have created a drag coefficient versus angle of attack curve. I did the experiment by using a wake rake (if that helps at all). My curve has the same parabolic trend as found in a NACA report on the same airfoil. However, my curve is shifted to the right by approximately 9 degrees. The minimum of the NACA Cd curve is about -5 degrees, while mine is about 4 degrees.

I was just wondering if anyone could shed some light as to why this is.  My experiment was performed at a Re of 100,000 and the NACA experiment was at 600,000 and according to the Cd curve of a cylinder, the Cd should decrease as Re increases. My Cd values turn out to be smaller than the NACA values due to the shift, so I don't think this is the reason.

Do you think that it is just because of bad experimentation on my part, or is it something else?

However, I'm wondering how feasible it is to use a large gyroscope to keep a rocket from moving around a lot while in flight.

Background: Last year, in my senior year of high school, I worked with a team that competed in the NASA ""Dropping In a Microgravity Environment"" (DIME) project that allows high school students to submit experiments to be performed in the Glenn research center drop tower. My group built and tested the effects of gyroscopes on angular motion in freefall. We found that a gyroscope does a lot to stabilize and dampen motion. Soon after we finished the project, SpaceX released [this](http://www.spacex.com/multimedia/videos.php?id=0&amp;cat=recent) video showing how they wanted to land and reuse their rockets. It got me to thinking about how the rocket could be stabilized upon reentry by using a large gyroscope built into the rocket, and also made me think about how it might be used to make more precise landings.

Some friends and I are thinking about experimenting with this while we're home over break, using model rockets and things we have left over from our experiment. Before we start, though, I'd like to know what Reddit thinks about the feasibility. Thoughts? The only info I've found about this is [here](http://www.ukrocketman.com/rocketry/gimbal.shtml), although they used the gyroscopes in the ascent, not descent.

Strange question but I have never seen it posed elsewhere.

I am currently a 2nd yr Analyst at a Bank in Manhattan in an Operations group. I graduated 3 years ago from a Finance Target University that is in the top 20 Undergrad Business Schools. 
For various reasons, I have been looking into the possibilities for lateraling into the Aerospace/ Commercial Space Industry. 

One of the many problems I am having is obviously a complete lack of relevant work experience. 
Basically my question is - Is there any reasonable way to go from Finance to Aerospace/Commercial Space industries?

A. What Things can I do to bulk my resume with Aerospace goodness?
B. What Sort of jobs will be big in the coming years - business side of these industries? 

I obviously know that grad schools are the main reset button for careers, and I welcome input here - but I list my thoughts on this below

1. Debt load + Opportunity cost of not working is quite a high price
2. Ive been taught if you do not go to the top ten MBA programs then dont go. Would it be better to try to go to a top MBA program that aerospace Companies target or to attempt to get a masters of science or something like that in Aerospace focus?

I have come to believe that EE has better prospects, but it would take me an extra year and a half to get an engineering degree instead of CompSci.  And with CompSci I'd be able to take a lot more math classes.
So, what do you guys think?  In 2 years will SpaceX and Planetary Resources and DSI and.. and.. and all the rest be hiring CompSci?  
btw, the school I will be going to does not have an Aerospace degree option.

I also have absolutely no aerospace background, so help from a hobbyist or professional would be awesome.

We know helicopter blades encounter vibratory loads (primarily at 1/rev frequency) as a result of small dissimilarities between blades and the aerodynamic environment. Trail edge tabs on the helicopter blades are added to help increase stability, but are a pain in the butt to maintain and operate, expensive, and time consuming. I am interested in the use of shape memory alloys used as *in-flight* tracking mechanisms/actuators to control the trailing edge tab in the helicopter blades.

Does anyone know whether or not this option is still being explored as a somewhat common solution to helicopter blades? If it isn't being explored, does anyone know why? I believe piezoelectrics were also studied, but couldn't produce a large enough deflection in the tabs, and I know certain Nitinol shape memory alloys were produced to create a deflection of nearly 20 degrees have been obtained. I'm not sure, however, whether this was ever put into use.

Can someone enlighten me?

My motivation for asking is that I am hoping to begin working in the space industry, driven by a desire to see men explore other worlds and settle in space. I want to work on the machines that explore and take men into space, and would much prefer not to work on machines built for war.

Clearly this is not a realistic goal in the pure sense. Many (probably most) of the technologies developed for one purpose are, by their nature, well suited for the other, and would quickly be adapted to it.

So I would just like to get a sense of how the aerospace industry tends to organize projects between civil and defense, and what the nature of the overlap is from a technological, economic, or project lifecycle perspective.

There are many companies that develop exclusively for defense. Outside of newspace, are there many aerospace companies that develop exclusively civil projects? I imagine that, due to the nature of aerospace economics (being heavily reliant on government contracts), such a company would not be able to survive long, and thus would be rare or non-existent.

It seems that most of the disadvantages come from the requirement that they be seaplanes. 

What if you dispensed with the notion that they should be like seaplanes? If they were regular planes built for resistance to near ocean-surface environments, they wouldn't need the hull/airframe compromises required of seaplanes, and they wouldn't be limited to operation in calm surface conditions. They could also avoid mid-ocean collisions with ships by flying over them. In effect, they would be mostly conventional aircraft which are optimized for and operate over long distances in the near-ocean ground effect zone. 

In case of engine failure over the ocean, they could be equipped with inflatable rafts that keep the hull/airframe afloat for salvage purposes. These would be designed to allow for landing, but not necessarily to allow take-off afterwards. 

Of course, this probably won't overcome the biggest potential disadvantages: the likely unfavorable reaction of regulators and the difficulty of getting development funded, given that the fuel savings aren't large enough to offset the difficulty/risk of development.

After three years, you receive a masters in Computing. 

I have a couple of questions - 

* Is this a good program? It seems like a 3 year commitment. Also, I eventually want to end up in the aerospace industry, will this help/hurt me?

* How helpful will a MS in Computing from Marquette be for future career development? 

* How do people from other aerospace companies view GE? Let's say 5 years from now I want to go to Lockheed, will the GE name be helpful?

* For anyone familiar with GE, is it hard to transfer between different GE locations?

The aircraft has a reference wing area SW = 50 m and the drag polar is defined by Cd = 0.0220 + 0.0600CL^2.  Assuming thrust to be independent of speed and proportional to relative density, σ, find for the AUW quoted the maximum level speed at the altitude given above.

I'd love to go back to the times when there wasnt such a big fuel crisis, back in the concorde days when things were built for speed and power rather than fuel economy and budget, back in the days when the UK would have no problem building huge wind tunnels with contraction ratios of about 18 to 20 with their own in-house power plants to power it.

I have many years of test engineering experience (hardware and software), and now I'm an aerospace grad student in a terminal master's program, going to school part time while continuing to work full-time. Here is my issue: I desperately want to be working at a company that is at least nominally aerospace-related. All of my classmates are; I feel like I am the only person at a completely non-aerospace tech company, and am concerned about it hurting my future career prospects. Additionally, I am one of those people who is extremely results-oriented. I would take a job doing grunt work for minimum wage if it meant I had the chance to contribute to an interesting and important company/project. I'm not unrealistic-- I'm not expecting to get a job as a test engineer at SpaceX (though that would be my ultimate dream job, as I'm sure is the case for 99% of other people here)-- I'm applying for jobs similar to my prior ones at all kinds of aerospace-related companies, even including companies like airlines and component suppliers. I am also totally open to jobs that are unrelated to my past experience.

Anyway, I've had zero luck with jobs at aerospace companies when applying directly. I've dealt with a number of tech recruiters whose clients include the aerospace industry, but then they inevitably never find aerospace-related jobs for me, only jobs in totally unrelated industries. I don't think there's anything grievously wrong with my resume or experience, as I've asked recruiters, my advisor, and classmates point-blank. And I have no problem getting jobs in other tech fields-- but that is not what I'm looking for. 

If anyone has advice about a very aerospace-focused recruiter in the remotely Los Angeles area, or if you yourself know of any relevant job openings, I would be so grateful.

Seeing as Tucson has a number of large aero/astro companies with facilities here, I figured this was worth a shot.

So I suppose my unusual request is this: If you are an aerospace engineer working in Tucson and are willing to show me around your workplace sometime over the next four days, please send me a PM. I look forward to hearing from you.

I came across this article about Sandia Labs developing a [laser guided 50 caliber round](http://www.defensereview.com/sandia-labs-self-guided-bullet-laser-guided-50-caliber-saboted-round-coming-for-the-u-s-ordnance-m2hb-qcb-quick-change-barrel-ma-deuce-heavy-machine-gun-hmg-meet-the-possible/). It occurred to me that we could develop this into an alternative weapon for drones. Instead of firing a round out of a conventional gun, however, much weight could be saved by using a scheme like a [Gyrojet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrojet) round. Basically, we end up with small laser guided kinetic kill missiles. 

The second part of this scheme involves a smaller, disposable parasite drone with gyrostabilized observation and targeting. Since it is an order of magnitude smaller, it can get much closer to the target and still be invisible to the naked eye. This would allow for much better target identification and laser designation. Once the target has been hit, the parasite drone would self destruct. 

This system would allow for much more selective lethality. Potentially, one could kill the target but leave another person sitting at the same table untouched.

I am an engineering student and I had some questions regarding rocket engines. SpaceX's Merlin engines use a bang bang controller to regulate the pressure. How does one effectively control the turbo pump? Wouldn't a variable transmission in the turbo pump allow it to be throttled properly? For obvious reasons, that would increase the complexity, price and weight of the turbo pump. But then that would allow a PID controller to be implemented instead of a bang bang controller. Another big factor that I did not want to mention was that there will be a higher turbo pump failure rate as if the gears did not properly engage, all hell would break loose. But in my mind, that would lead a way to their landing system to be much more effective. Also, that might allow the whole gimbal system to be thrown out and directly controlled by throttling the individual engines.

So I've recently been accepted to an online program for a [Master in Aeronautical Science with a specialization in Space Operations management.](http://worldwide.erau.edu/degrees/graduate/aeronautical-science/index.html) I currently work for a military contractor that will pay for relevant education. I've gotten my supervisor to tentatively approve the funding for this program, however, he isn't thrilled about it.

My undergraduate degree is in Political Science, and I'm a bit worried about aquiring such a narrow degree. Since I do not have an engineering background, I'm obviously looking to be involved on the business and operations management side of things. Would I be better off with a [Logistics](http://worldwide.erau.edu/degrees/graduate/logistics-supply-chain-management/index.html) or [Project Mangement](http://worldwide.erau.edu/degrees/graduate/project-management/index.html) degree? 

How hard is it to work in Aerospace without an engineering background? I don't want to have nothing to show for the effort I put into my degree, but at the same time, I want to position myself to succeed in this industry.

However, I didn't really do well in most theoretical classes. I like building things and watch them come to life in front of me. I was going to go do engineering but the school offered me more money so I decided to go for Physics at undergrad and then aerospace or mechanical engineering at graduate school.
Since I didn't really do that well in my undergrads, what do you guys think my next step should be? This may sound arrogant but I know I could have handled the undergraduate coursework very well if I were really interested.

I was thinking of taking the GRE and the physics and math GREs to offset my not so shiny GPA. Any suggestions?

What's the greatest range one could get from devices we could build in theory?

Sandia National labs has [.50 caliber guided bullets that can hit within 8 inches of a laser designated target](http://www.dailytech.com/SelfGuided+Bullet+is+a+Soldiers+Best+Friend/article23927.htm). 

Could we get reliable (&gt;99%) sniper kills at distances of 6000 or 7000 feet? Could such kills be accomplished with rail guns, lasers, or small kinetic kill missiles? If such a weapon could fit in a stealthed craft like a Sentinel drone, this would be closer to enabling such assassinations, though it would fall far short in terms of deniability. That's fine, since I'm just using this as a sort of technology benchmark.

I'm trying to gauge how far away we are technologically from governments carrying out drone assassinations in densely populated regions of 1st world countries, either domestically or in other 1st world countries.

Wanted to share how I achieved success.,2,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/151db9/got_a_position_as_an_aerospace_engineer_wanted_to/,"To protect myself, I will not name locations or companys but I finally got the position of a lifetime. I have been applying for this company for about 6 months with not even a call back. About a month back, I got a call back for a similar position, but never got past the initial phone interview. Feeling frustrated, I decided to get creative. I went to the company website and found, deep with in the html code of the site, a few phone numbers to the main office. I called the main office and said that I was trying to contact an Engineer in Riverside (the area I want to work). They transferred me to that office where I talked to a secretary. After citing a bogus name from the department I wanted to work in, I got transferred to an engineers desk!!!! HE PICKED UP! LUCK! I told him that I was supposed to get an interview, but never received details on the next step. He bought it. He then gave me a job listing code that was NOT listed on any of the job boards. I applied, got a call one week later for the phone interview, got scheduled for the VALPAR exam. Dominated it. Then got my final interview and eventually, the position.
I think the point here is that in this economy with THOUSANDS of people in your area looking for work, you have to do something special to stand out. I took a bit of a back door approach with great success! Anyone else have some interesting stories on how they got hired in a job?",,False,,t5_2qirz,False,,,True,t3_151db9,http://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/151db9/got_a_position_as_an_aerospace_engineer_wanted_to/,
