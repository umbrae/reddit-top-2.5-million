Long story short, my sister married a man 20 years ago when I was 8.  This man was my brother-in-law but for all purposes he was more a brother, I don't remember life without him.  His son, my nephew, and really one of my best buds (like a little brother) introduced me to Sips and the Yogscast back in December, along with Minecraft and just the whole ""YouTube Gameplay Sensation.""  Can't think the guy enough for that, or I wouldn't be here.

Well, he got himself a girlfriend a few months ago, and his dad did him the favor of engaging in a sexual relationship with her (she was willing, too, so she's just as much a villain) and now of course the family is destroyed.  His dad's in jail for a long time, his relationship is over, he's going to have to uproot and move likely to a new school, just all sorts of messy shit.  To make matters worse, the dad was also law enforcement so yeah!  This shit, all of our woes and private pain, is all over the goddamn local television stations.  There's no fucking escape, not even the internet!  Except for Sips.

Last night, despite how destroyed and devastated everyone is, my nephew and I laughed our asses off watching some good ol' Sips.  First happy moment in what has seemed an eternity of days since Monday as this media whiplash and frenzy and.. just utter shit raining from the skies on my family continues, we escaped briefly into the mind of the Big Bastard himself.

Thanks so much, Sips, Chris, whatever.  I know you see these sappy shitty stories all the time but you're fucking making a difference.  I'm 28 years old and I haven't put even 1/1000000th of the smiles on peoples' faces as you have, just doing what you love to do.  Your style, your comedy, it's a figurative (or who knows, maybe literal) GODSEND.

I would like to bring attention to (and celebrate) the fact that Sips clearly is a feminist icon making influential contributions to the feminist discourse. I have included a short analysis of the Skyrim play-though as evidence of this claim. 

Firstly, Princess Leia is a self-sufficient whore and very proud of her profession; she claims her sexuality and lives it out the way *she* wants. She put herself through College and is now the arch-mage. *Talk about breaking the glass ceiling!* 

At same time she’s a single mother of two and is balancing a professional carrier as a whore/ arch-mage/adventurer with a family life.*Now that’s a relevant feminist narrative if I’ve ever seen one!*

While being a single mother she has still created a family consisting of strong women and together they are raising the children - and teaching Lucia to be fierce knife wielding adventurer. 

Also, the tri-force is an example of how classic gender roles are broken and replaced by a more inclusive gender idea within the narrative. Uthgerd is a masculine, butch woman (and possibly a lesbian based on her very strong emotions towards Leia) and Satan is clearly a gender-queer person changing his/her gender from episode to episode. *Double rainbow tri-force all the way!*

Obviously Sips has carefully planned out this story, and should be praised for his bold statement and inclusive You-tube game play. You go girl!  

What are your thoughts on Sips as a feminist icon?

I remain,

I'm the creator of Best of Sips (animated) (http://bit.ly/16Avi26) and I have been getting some suggestions about collaborating with Sips on his series, Storytime With Sips. I think it sounds like a pretty fantastic idea and I'm wondering what you think about it? If the guy himself reads this, maybe I could get some feedback from you?

I think, as I said before, that it would be pretty fantastic. There's one problem though. The stories might be difficult to animate. But that differs from story to story.

Anyway, I would love to hear what you think about this!

Our magnificent bastard has conquered the survival of himself, but now it's time for him to take the next step and ensure the evolutionary survival of his very own species; Sips, I think you should play Spore (www.gamingsteve.com/images/2008/02/spore1-thumb-580x324.jpg) . The game is open world with a massive degree of customisation, exploration, combat, humour and creatures that resemble Big Butts. You'll start off as a cell based organism and climb the evolutionary ladder to the top of the food chain where your species will begin the retailing of pure dirt on the inter-galactic market.

I'd love to see Sips play this game, simply because of how random it is. The creatures you create, the ones you encounter, the empire you build and the adventures you go on are all the perfect formula for a great YouTube series, and with the success of Skyrim and other open world games, I think it's obvious that people want to see Sips play games that HE enjoys, with an emphasis on open world games where he can create his own adventure and story.

I took the quest called ""Revenge of the Beaver Mafia"" which asked me to kill and collect 10 Beaver Mafia skins, but everytime I get to the 10th kill the counter in the quest log resets and I can't progress!  I can't get my ""Pink Slippers of Agility"" If I can't finish this quest and I need to get those slippers to kill the ""Loin Clothed Builder"". Please help! 

I'm on the ""Fort Fantastic"" server by the way. 

Anyone else encounter this bug? No? Just me? I asked my mum and dad and they said they haven't reached that far yet.

1374524108.0,71,self.sips,1iu2vd,"The cutting of Sips' newer series. Please read it, I feel it's important to talk about this now, with the release of Dishonored #1.",88,17,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1iu2vd/the_cutting_of_sips_newer_series_please_read_it_i/,"Alright, so this is (as stated in the title) about the way Sips cuts his newer playthrough episodes, especially Skyrim and now Dishonored.

Please note: This is *not* about the crazy edits, music overlays, etc. They are f-ing hilarious and a perfect way to express some extra sipsyness which couldn't be achieved through normal gameplay means. I think we can all agree on that, no discussion needed, they are the smelly paint in our dirty beards, the 'Living on a prayer' in our collective Bon Jovi Concert. 

No, this is about the small cuts. They hurt, man ..

Let me explain what I mean by sidetracking a little: How many people watched your 'Random Skyrim Chores' video on twitch where basically all you do is running back and forth, selling stuff to npcs and inventory management? Please correct me, if I'm wrong, but I think it's the twitch video that got the most viewers. How many people asked for a 'Building Lake View Manor' video instead of doing it completely off camera in the last few days? And why is it that people want to see this not-so-fast-paced-and-content-loaded stuff?

Because it's a part of Princess Leia's life, a character that grew dear to our hearts. No one's life is packed full of action left, right and center .. and part of getting to know, getting to love a character is not only to see them succeed but also to see them struggle, to see them fail, basically to see them **live**. That's what connects you to a character, be it in literature, cinema or games.

I can see the point in not showing a second run through an empty Haemar's shame to get to Clavicus Vile again, absolutely, no question, but this is really not about big stuff, like that, or building a house or whatever, it's the small things. I feel that a lot of what you showed in the early episodes of Skyrim and what made it 'fluid' and made it flow would have just been cut out if it came out as an episode now. We were adventuring with you and Leia early on and we loved it, we were picking flowers and upgrading our gear together. Now .. well, it feels more like 'ChinchillaDave's Skyrim Adventures' ever so often. (which I love btw, if you don't know it check it out, but you'll see what I mean - different style)

I'm getting to the point now. It's the little things: Cutting switching to a different shout/spell. Cutting looting a single chest. Ransacking a room: Either cutting it all out or making 3 cuts out of it where each one shows you facing a different direction of the room. Cutting dialogue, Cutting exploring a new town, and meeting new people! Sure, it can be beneficial to compress a dungeon run, but if it's overdone like cut after cut after cut .. sometimes, you feel like you lose connection to the character. It's not only about getting to the end, it's about enjoying (and living) the journey.

The only reason I forced myself to type this wall of text anyway is the first episode of your Dishonored playthrough. Please don't do it like this, please don't. If you don't show the journey and only bits and pieces it's just .. we don't *really* follow you along, you're leaving a little bit of our immersion behind with every unnecessary cut. Jumping through different rooms by cutting means we can't follow the map layout and therefore your decisions on how you approach stuff and situations. That shit is important in this game.

I know, I'm not alone with this. I've heard it before in this subreddit as well as in some of the the video comments. Buds, if you feel the same, please speak up now and let me know or let the guy himself know.

I am counting on you leaving a comment with your opinion on this matter, even if you disagree completely.

Thank you and your tushie.


**Edit:** Since many of the comments are about Skyrim, I just want to say that this is actually really more about Dishonored and a possible Dishonored playthrough than about Skyrim, even though I mostly talked about Skyrim and Leia in this post.

&gt;... disquieted dawn breaks over Solitude where local lawyer Nick Cage, 55, practices. Nick has spend the last few weeks collecting testimonies from across Skyrim's legal establishment concerning the rise in so-called ""Unattributable Bucket-related Deaths"" (or USDs, in the lingo of Cloud District legalists). Much has been discussed in these pages recently on the subject of bucket-deaths (and the Jarl of Falkreith has this morning hung educational posters about his hold advising citizens on proper bucket placement so as to avoid it falling), so it was with some reticence that I met Nick for a quick mead at the docks. 


&gt;According to his claims, the scenes of death in nearly all recorded cases betray tell-tale signs of up to three more bodies - signs he says were missed by Hold investigators, or covered-up. A Blue Palace spokesman stated, in response to our enquiries,

&gt;""We have reviewed the so-called evidence gathered by Mr Cage and can categorically state there is no 'Bucket Murderer' who is somehow present everytime a bucket falls and kills someone, which regretably is happening far too often. While it's true that in most cases City guards report seeing extra bootprints melted into the ground, any fire hot enough would have to be Satan's own, and in any case, the bootprints vanish after a while, which is impossible and invalidates Mr Cage's whole theory.""

If you want awesomenauts you'll have to visit my post on the [Awesomenauts subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/1f87ad/with_the_new_humble_bundle_im_sure_some_of_us_got/)

In order to prevent people from hogging too many games I'll give away a max of two games per person, just leave a post of the game you want.

I'll be waiting until 6-8 PM (GMT +1) until I give out the keys.

If there's more requests than I have for a certain game I'll choose randomly.

(so if 4 people want hotline miami I can only give away 3 copies so I'll give it away to 3 of the 4 people)",,False,,t5_2uts5,1369870957.0,,2,True,t3_1f9jzp,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1f9jzp/because_you_guys_are_such_fantastic_bastards_ill/,

The way the game is set up, unless you set the download mode to ""buddies only,"" it will automatically populate your world with the latest made creations. This results in some really hideous stuff, especially in the Civ and Space stages, where everything often ends up being a bunch of untextured squares.

I certainly don't mean to tell you how to play your game, but you'll find far more well-designed and interesting things if you take some time and look through the Sporepedia website for creators you like, and buddy them up. You also might want to go through and delete creations your buddies haven't made, to prevent them from clogging up the works.

Personally, I suggest [Parkboy](http://www.spore.com/view/myspore/Parkaboy), [dananddna](http://www.spore.com/view/myspore/dananddna), and [Andeavor](http://www.spore.com/view/myspore/Andeavor). Their stuff is excellent and really captures the cartoony coolness of Spore.

1369988430.0,45,self.sips,1fe6lt,I for one am looking forward to another millennium of Don't Starve,47,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1fe6lt/i_for_one_am_looking_forward_to_another/,"Warning: I am shit at math, so please correct me if any of this is wrong.


According to the wiki, each full day (one full rotation of the clock) in Don't Starve lasts 8 minutes. Since Sips is currently on roughly day 112, that means he has 999,888 Don't Starve days left until he reaches Day 1 million. Some basic division tells us that Sips has roughly 15.2 years of constant Don't Starve playing to reach day 1 million. This is quite some time, but not an inconceivable length of time. 


*However*, due to the fact that Sips doesn't play Don't Starve 24/7, but instead uploads a roughly 32 minute Don't Starve video every 2 days, this increases the total time for him to reach his goal massively:



- every video is roughly 4 Don't Starve days 

- Sips uploads a video ever 2 IRL days

- Every 2 IRL days = 4 DS days

- Every 1 DS day = .5 IRL days



So, for every Don't Starve day Sips survives, half a real life day goes by. Because of this, it will take him one million divided by 2, or around 500,000 IRL days to reach day 1 million, assuming of course Sips continues to post regularly and for a regular amount of time each video. **500,000 days is roughly 1,369 years.**

The only possible explanation for Sips being able to create videos for such a huge length of time is that in the next few decades scientists are going to discover an immortality serum, and of course Sips will be the first to be bestowed with it, due to his fantasticness. He will then spend the next millennium and a half continuing to produce videos! What a absolutely fantastic bastard. My descendents and I look forward to enjoying his videos for the next 13 centuries.",,False,,t5_2uts5,False,,1,True,t3_1fe6lt,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1fe6lt/i_for_one_am_looking_forward_to_another/,

Drew Darpyshyn

Jack Long

It was the end of another long week at the SipsCo offices, and the staff all quietly collected their things and exhaustively headed home. One employee, Eric Robertson, was still working hard, trying to sort out the last few bugs before their new game came out.

The game was called “Call of Judy: Flailing on the phone.”. In honesty the game had failure written all over it. What kind of person would buy a Medieval/Action-RPG game about a mysterious woman, played by Judi Dench who gives contracts to some guy? Nobody!

Eric was frustrated that he couldn’t fix a game breaking glitch, when his boss and team manager Ron Johnson announced,

“Eric, I’m giving  you,Drew and Jack a weeks vacation. It starts tomorrow. Go get your stuff and get out of here!”.

Eric thought it was strange for his boss to give him a vacation, but he said nothing of it and left with an appreciatively smug look on his face. As soon as he arrived home he booted his computer, loaded Skipe (A computer video messaging program) and called his friends-in-vacation Jack and Drew.

“Jack, Drew. We’re going to Prague.” Eric said in his most montage starting voice.

“I uh... I really don’t think skipping work is a good idea...” replied Drew.

“That’s the thing Drew, Old Man Ron gave us the week off!”

Within a few moments, the conversation turned from a regular chat to a lively debate. Discussing things such as where to stay, what travel tickets to get, where to fly from the next day and much more. The group finally decided, and met up the next morning at Jovi Airport.

When the group arrived, they walked into the terminal, checked in and took seats in a restaurant in the post check-in waiting area.

“So,” Jack said through the remnants of the burger in his mouth. “what do we call ourselves?”

“What on earth do you mean?” replied Drew over his steak and chips.

“You know, like, The Beatles?”

“No I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“We need a name for our little group to have Drew.”

“It has to be said I agree with Jack,” Eric was always one to input his opinion on everything.

Jack stood up, and turned around, he saw a shop “The Three Amigos”.

“How about that!?” He exclamed and pointed at the sign.

“The Three Amigos.” Eric repeated.

And so it was decided, from that day on, the group would be known as “The Three Amigos”!

For example: Recently I learned in Sips' ""Don't starve"" that sips is indeed a vampire, and in ""FTB with Sijn"", that his mother is still alive in the year 3000, and that she lives underwater. There is also such information on his yogpage that his mother was unfortunately killed by lamps, and etc. 
It would be wonderful if we had somewhere for all of these tales and secrets to be kept, and up to date. Where we could theorise and collect the facts together. So maybe his mother is also a vampire and that is why she lived for so long, or that he is a time traveller or psychic, to find out how she dies.

1371882817.0,39,self.sips,1guf55,[Game] The Sips Hydration Game,44,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1guf55/game_the_sips_hydration_game/,"A friend and I recently began developing a game we could play when we hang out watching videos. The aim of the game is to enjoy at least one Sips video while enjoying a beverage of your choice (though actually chocolate milk is mandatory). The general idea is to consume some of your beverage whenever you notice a classic ""Sipsism"". Two modes exist; casual mode, and hardcore mode. Essentially the rules are the same in each case, but they're more vague in hardcore mode.

**Casual Mode Rules**

In casual mode, you drink whenever Sips:

* Plays additional music,
* Zooms / cuts to another scene,
* Annotates an additional word / phrase on screen,
* Roleplays (e.g. talks to an NPC, adds some story to a character),

Additionally, certain phrases will trigger consumption:

* ""Not the best"" or ""Fantastic"",
* ""Aw [insert Sips' term for poop]"" or ""Holy [insert Sips' term for poop]"",
* ""Look at this / that"",
* ""Right in the butt"",
* ""Anybody? Just me? Maybe my mum / dad?"",
* ""It's gotta be said"",
* ""Too too much"".


**Hardcore Mode Rules**

In hardcore mode, you drink constantly while Sips:

* Plays additional music,
* Zooms / cuts to another scene,
* Annotates an additional word / phrase on screen,
* Roleplays (e.g. talks to an NPC, adds some story to a character),

Additionally, certain conversation topics will trigger consumption:

* Poo (including exclamations),
* When he describes how good something is (e.g. ""Not the best"", ""That's great"", ""Fantastic""),
* Any phrase that directs your attention to something,
* Butts,
* Sips' parents,
* Films; real, fake, or in development (i.e. PotC).


Optional rule:

* Several Sipsisms occuring at the same time or in succession require an extra consumption.

Feel free to change rules, add your own (honestly though, these are plenty), pick a few from the list to run with, or mix and match between casual and hardcore modes. Naturally some rules are more applicable to some games than others; he doesn't roleplay much in SimCity, or describe how good things are in Skyrim very often. I think they all sort of balance out though. You may need to change the rules for older videos where the Sipsisms are a bit different.


Add your own rules below, and I may edit them into the main post.

(No Spoilers),40,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1jf9cg/sips_skyrim_neighbors_no_spoilers/,"I've just started using the DLCs, and with a new character. I started a house in Lakeview Manor as well after looking at all the options. And as I walked towards my home for the first time, I happen to pass by Pinewatch. A few episodes ago, I saw a YouTube comment recommending Sips check the place out, for the 'interesting' neighbors.
So I just build what I can of the house, drop off some stuff, and take Lydia to go meet the new neighbors.
Welllll, it was not what I expected, but it was a lot of fun, and the reward at the end may be the greatest I've ever seen in Skyrim. (Sips, have Handel's Hallelujah ready for this one!)
So anyway, YES, I approve of Sips meeting his neighbors ASAP.
If there is a god, Sips has this in the works already and we'll see it soon.

What you should do with this is make a spider farm. Plant spider eggs from killing either a huge spider nests or a spider queen. Plant them close to the fleshy bulb once it has grown out a bit.

Sips has a mineshaft enterance in the middle of his house.

Apparently, lumber-jacking is what Sips does best.

Sips' original skin and character was Granny Bacon as revealed in his and Sjin's Minecraft series.

He suffers from vitamin deficiency, hence the grey skin.

He owns a Greggs in the Isle of Wight, despite the fact that there is no Greggs there.

He's Canadian, but lives in Jersey (Channel Islands).

Sips played as Granny Bacon in Shadow of Israphel, hence the name ""Granny_Bacon"" in the earlier episodes of the series ""Minecraft with Sips/Sjin.

Sips is considered by many to be the ""cult classic"" of the Yogscast, and is quickly gaining a large and loyal following due to his soothing voice, awesome orc-killing skills and surreal sense of humour.

In the third episode of Simon and Lewis' The Dropper series, at 11:30 Lewis did an impression of Sips, saying ""Hey I'm making a camp here 
guys!"" in a terrible Canadian accent.

Sips' real name was revealed on his tumblr.

Sips was born on the June 5th in 1980.

Aside from 'Icing Jokers', doing a Flip is the main way Sips escapes danger.

In ""Tekkit - Episode 15 - Geothermal Facility"", Sjin reveals that Sips is ""the bee's knees"".

It was also revealed in multiple episodes of ""Minecraft with Sips/Sjin"" that Sips is in fact the best gumshoe in the land.

Because of his series of the game Towns, Towns added Heroes with one being ""Sips, the Campmaker"" whom can raise the infamous ""Sadon"" 
from the dead to fight.

During Martyn Littlewood's stream on the 24th of August 2012, while talking about his upcoming move to YogTowers he answered a question from FrozenGhost99 which concerned Sips' presence in the Office. Martyn answered saying that Sips does not work at the office as he has a wife and kids and a decent job at a bank.

In episode 58 of his and Sjin's Minecraft series, Sips reveals that he's actually a ghost, after dying a few episodes ago in lava; Sjin is the only person that can see him.

Sips has admitted to being glassist, which means intolerant to one with glasses. He claims this to be the reason he has never seen a Harry Potter movie.

Sips recently revealed that 'lamps killed his mother'. 

Sips was the first person to eat a jaffa cake produced by Honeydew Inc.

SIPS stands for Side Impact Protection System.

During episode 73 of Tekkit 3 with Sips and Sjin, after Sjin suggested building a gauntlet, Sips revealed that his grandfather had been a barbarian and had died in a gauntlet.

Sips lived in Ottawa, Canada before moving to England.",,False,,t5_2uts5,False,,,True,t3_1c4jct,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1c4jct/sips_trivia_taken_from_the_yogscast_wiki/,

These specs aren't hugely powerful, but should be perfectly sufficient for the number of players we're currently coping with. These specs should be able to handle a good 40+ players without strain, given that we've now uninstalled the monstrous world-eater that is Essentials. Having a whole dedicated server, and not just a re-hosted Minecraft server, will allow us to host Teamspeak and web servers easily. We'll be ported all the world data to the new server, as well as some plugin data, so the change should be fairly seamless. We're buying a 3 month lease of a 4G Kimsufi server, running Debian 7.

1370638147.0,31,self.sips,1fvxry,Sips Skyrim Story,33,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1fvxry/sips_skyrim_story/,"The fierce winds hit hard and fast against the backs of the weary travelers; streaks of snow blotting out the setting sun and scratching at their skin. One, a fiery mass of death and chaos, was unaffected by the shivering cold, another traveler; a cold blooded wizard of great magic, was also braving the storm with tremendous courage. Meanwhile the fleshy meat-sack of muscle and metal shivered in her iron boots, often falling behind and having to catch up. It was a nasty night to be stuck out in the furious weather of Skyrim’s mountains, but all the same the warriors pushed on to their destination so that they may rest and regain their strength.

Echoing off the rocky cliffs were the sounds of only pain and of desperation. Winds whipped and cut at the sides, whistling through the dense storm. Fire crackled and burned, dying out; the snow was getting at the burning beast. Heavy and tired feet sunk deep into the white, soft ground and the clanking of the tired caribou warrior rattled along the path, each step seeming heavier than the last. To break the silence and dullness of the road trip, a small grey fox patted out of broken and beaten bushes, blocking the path. Before it could realize the mistake it had made, its fur became engulfed in flames and its body was flung through the air, like some sort of fireworks show. The lizard started laughing with a devious grin carved across her reptilian face. Her humor enticed the hellish apparition to let out a deep, rumbling laughter, but it could not reach the hollowed soul of the caribou warrior - killing humans was much more fun for her.

Alas, their enjoyment could only last a short time. The mountain soon shook with great power as if it were coming alive. A terrifying screech, low but fierce, rang across the arid sky and burrowed deep into the adventurers’ ears. The caribou was first on the draw, her bow already high and eager to launch furies of pain at its target. “Oh my god Uthgerd, it happens every single time!” yelled the reptilian woman in a strangely masculine voice. Uthgerd, as she must have been called, didn’t pay any attention to the scaled mage’s cries; instead she had her eyes locked on the sky and was waiting for her enemy to appear. The apparition was a bit casual about the whole ordeal and never once gave a look of shock or fear, just gently raised one flaming hand to the night sky.

The white clouds hid the roar’s true form, but all the warriors knew what they were up against. The creature was powerful, a tough foe. They had fought many before, but now this one had the advantage. Quickly, they all tried to get their footing and prepare for the attack. At long last, a dark shape formed behind the gray clouds, still cloaking the beast in shadows. Another screech sliced through the air. Then another. The clouds broke, the ground shook, and the jaw of a magnificent monster came inches from Uthgerd’s face; the apparition swears he saw the caribou warrior spit on the dragon. Drool dripped from the tongue and cheeks of the snarling giant, the gaping hole of his mouth seeming to have no end, darkness hidden within him. The foul smelling breath soon overpowered their noses.

In that short instance while the dragon had jumped at Uthgerd, she had taken in her opponent and learned what she was really up against, but before she could attack he had swiftly pulled up and flown back over her head. Uthgerd grunted.

In a burst of purple flames, the apparition was gone, lost to some other dimension. “Satan!” screamed out the mage, before summoning him back to the living world in the same ghostly fires he left. Satan still seemed unaffected by the change of events and let loose a volley of fireballs into the air, trying to locate his target and lighting up the gray sky. Meanwhile, Uthgerd paced around stupidly in a circle with her bow drawn, not wanting to miss her chance to strike.

Rocks tumbled down onto the lizard and the mountain was shook to its core. After regaining her balance, the wizard looked straight up to see the gaping jaw of the dragon looking down on her. In an instant, she was engulfed in the beast’s flames. “Oh shit!” she cried out and dashed away to the Nordic caribou, “Uthgerd, pick up the slack will ya?” She responded quickly and fired one arrow after another right into the butt of the dragon. Satan’s hellish fire sunk into the dragon’s scales and tore away at its flesh. Unable to withstand the beating, the dragon fell off of his perch up high on the mountain and tumbled down the rigid rock sides until it landed far beneath the travelers.

“Aw,” the Argonian pouted, looking down past the clouds to where the dragon had fallen, “I wanted that guy’s soul. Well no matter, we’re almost to the top.” The lizard started talking about what she was going to do next, explaining things that seemed obvious; but she was talking to herself. This was normal for her to do and her companions had learned not to say anything, though her constant babbling made Uthgerd believe she was possessed. Uthgerd once told this to Satan who merely laughed and turned away. Speaking of Satan, he once again vanished with his purple explosion of heat.

Once they reached the top it became clear that they were not the only ones who had to deal with the dragon’s fury, seeing as a great deal of bandits’ burnt and mutilated bodies were strewn around the campsite, and flames licked at the cold snow on the mountain’s peak. This didn’t bother the Argonian, but the caribou warrior was saddened that she could not be the one to have dug her blade deep into the flesh of these worthless thieves and killers. This made her anxious to continue on into the bandit lair and delve deep inside the mountain, but the mage; who had been overturning the bodies in search of loot, expressed her desire to rest.

The sun had set fully during the attack, and now the sky was peaceful and black, the full moon illuminating their humble camp. Stars shimmered gloriously overhead and created a romantic feel. Uthgerd was hoping tonight she would have the courage to tell the mage how she really felt. But as the sexy lizard drew close, Uthgerd could only nod when her companion asked her to carry some books; the unbroken woman was suffering of a broken heart. “Okay!” said the Argonian joyously as she set down the last bucket on the bandit’s head, “I think six hours of sleep will be good enough, don’t you Uthgerd?” Uthgerd said nothing, “See, look at Uthgerd, she probably doesn’t even sleep, just watches me while I’m in bed.”

The lizard laid down on her bedroll and closed her eyes, and Uthgerd tried to do the same. But, as she fell into a deep sleep, vicious images filled her head. A miller woman, blood pouring out of her neck, filling the room and drowning Uthgerd. Satan just hovering over her, laughing and laughing his deep hideous laugh. That woman’s expression, from so tough and protective to utter fear. Then to nothing. The woman screamed and screamed, then bled. “How could you do this to her Uthgerd!” “What is wrong with you!” Uthgerd couldn’t take it, she couldn’t handle the guilt, the woman didn’t deserve it, she didn’t deserve any of it!

She woke up in a cold sweat and tried to go to a happier place. She thought of the first time she met her love, the first time she met Princess Leia.
 
Uthgerd was sitting in The Bannered Mare, pouring as much mead as she could down her throat, trying to forget about what she had done to the boy, trying to block out her rage and anger at the companions, and at herself. A cold wind blew as the door slid open. The most beautiful woman Uthgerd had ever seen walked in. She had a stride that showed true power, but yet she was gentle and kind. Leia walked around and talked to some other people first, sending a shot of jealousy up Uthgerd’s spine so when it came time to talk the lizard, she made sure to act as tough as she could, be as strong as she could.
	
Leia said something about a woman named Sarah Connor and made small talk, her accent strange and deep, but then the fight started and a bet was made. Uthgerd, though only betting a little gold, really was betting her loyalty. If this slim Argonian could beat her, she would follow her wherever she may go. With the final blow, when Leia won the fight, Uthgerd knew that this feeling she had must be real. Leia approached her and asked for her help, so quickly Uthgerd responded, “Let’s not waste any time.” Uthgerd thought Leia was a different type of woman but the mage couldn’t understand what the broken warrior had implied. As they left, Uthgerd looked longingly at the special room she had rented at the inn.

Deep in hell, Satan was also thinking of his time with Leia. It bothered him that his time with her was always so short and that they never had time to just sit down and talk, but he enjoyed the battles all the same. It had been a while since anyone had been able to summon him, most would fail and bring him to Tamriel with only half of his full strength. So he was surprised when he was shifted over to the living world, amazed by the strength of his master. But he was still angry that his simplified form, a form her made so that he could remain stable among the land of the living and not explode into a nuclear disaster, still looked very feminine. Maybe one day the arch-mage could summon him in his real true form, but for now he enjoyed his time on the battlefield.

As the sun rose and Leia awoke, Uthgerd regained her gruff attitude and walked over to the entrance of the bandit camp. “Uthgerd’s ready to go!” yelled the mage, “So how about we summon Satan?” In that glorious explosion, the Devil himself stood before them. Together, they were strong enough to take on whatever challenges were set out for them, together they could take Skyrim by storm. But that’s a story you’ll have to wait and see for yourself. In the meantime, let’s turn on the Spark Mandrill theme. As loud as she could, the Argonian prostitute yelled, “Triforce activate!”

Some people here might have heard of the Maktotos, we appeared on the famous internet show of our great mayor sips_. I'm sitting in a coffee shop in Sips City right now, where I found this fantastic subreddit for our fantastic mayor, thought I would join. Life in Sips City became pretty rough for the Maktoto's the last couple of months, after my wife died on one of the famous Bon Jovi concerts, because she drowned in chocolate milk. There was some kind of huge party for our mayor, something with 1 million buds following him around the internet. Sadly, she didn't make it. After that, I had to sell our kids to Sipsville, to one of the factorys there, so we can make some money.
 I'm living in a seedy motel at the moment, I recently got a job at the newly built ferry terminal, I joined the anti-shark-task-force. That's right. Apparently those high wealth tourists are really afraid of sharks, even tho there aren't even sharks in the mississipsi river.
Well, that's enough for me today, I pretty much just survived a zombie outbreak, armed with nothing but a needle. That's even more useless, than it sounds like, so I'll take a nap. See ya buds, I hope we can all become great friends.

I'm writing an article for my company about the Mace Swinger project, and I'd love to get some insight from the people actually involved. I work in social media, and the story of Sips' success, and this new game coming out of it, is a great focus for my next article.

I know all of these guys have made appearances on this sub, and I'm hoping they'll see this. If anyone involved in Mace Swinger, or in contact with Sips is interested in shooting me a few quotes, send me an orangered and I'll give you my contact info.

* You should take the marble flooring where you picked the﻿ evil flowers with the pitchfork  
* When you make a bird cage and feed the bird fruit/veg, then the bird will give you the seeds of the plant you gave it so if you get a dragon fruit, give it too your bird! Don't just give it a crappy carrot!  
* If you give the bird any kind of meat (apart from uncooked monster meat) it will give an egg. So you can feed it cooked monster meat and get a much more nutritional egg in return, which is useful in winter.
* You can take the tall bird egg from old laser eye and hatch it! Place it next to the fire during the night but not during the day because it will cook! If you hatch it properly, it will give a small bird which will act as a follower! 
* You didn't fertilize all the grass tufts! Missed one... 
* Chester is short for Otto von Chesterfield, Esquire.
* Give more suggestions for sips!  ",,False,,t5_2uts5,1369990350.0,,,True,t3_1fe72v,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1fe72v/tips_for_sips_dont_starve/,

I will make one of these posts at significant points in the games development. I will make sure to spend more time on this that I did on my last. I have had lots of people come forward from the community offering me help which is just magnificent. If any of you bastards think you can contribute anything to the game then make sure to speak out and say so.

I'm also considering putting the game on steam greenlight. Another thing that I've been thinking about is charging a small amount (likely 99p) for the game. This is purely so that I can get people who are more skilled to help out with things like art and sound in the next game. 

Thank you so much everyone for the great comments in the last post. If you have any questions, put them below. Now that I'm on my PC, I can answer them fully. I have to get back to researching now, looking at what I should get to.

So as I embarked on this great new frontier I found people to be so rude to each other as chat and non-tolerant of my ineptness as I was learning the game. 
So it got me thinking that as someone who keeps a relatively quiet online profile that I'd just say what a bunch of fantastic bastards this community is and compared to the general rudeness of internet we are kind, accepting and brilliant bunch.

Also encouraged are happy stories that will be uplifting to others!  Tell us about a recent success you had, whether big or small.

I dunno about you guys, but I've played the game extensively and I feel a master thread of tips would be mighty helpful!

To start us off: Sips, never make your line queues too long or your guests will waste time, get fatigued and go home before spending all their money!

If your guests are too nervous to ride some of your bigger coasters, you can put Thrill rides near them to hopefully boost their confidence and bravery.

When building your own Coasters, it's wise to bank as many of the high-speed turns as possible to reduce the overall nausea rating.

Hope that's a nice start! I've got plenty more tips I'm willing to share but I'd like to get some input from other experienced Tycoons out there! Really looking forward to this series!

1) With regular livestream uploads we will get more regular Sips content. Perhaps a triple whammy a day. Two regular vids and a piece of the live stream.

2) With more videos being watched Sips gets mo money. Mo money means mo time. Mo time means mo videos or mo editing. Everybody wins.

3) Youtube uploading is slow and unreliable. Uploading in chunks is much less likely to cause issues and delay the videos.

^List of Prizes. Read on to win one of them! 

Hey there. As some of you may know, it's Sips' birthday on June the 5th. He will be turning 33 years old! 

Now, I want YOU to make him a special birthday gift. That can be anything from a drawing, to a remix, a song, an animation - WHATEVER. You don't have much time left! I will give you until midnight GMT of June the 8th to make something for him. I want this to be his best and most supported birthday ever. 
I mean c'mon, he gives us fucking everything we want, let's give him some love back! 

Now to the prizes! 
There are 9 prizes in total. I bought the latest Indie Bundles 3 times. I used all of the codes I received as give-aways to the Sips comunity so far. Most of them went to the Sipslam (steamgroup of me and some friends) and some I gave out on his twitch tv channel. For nothing at all. 

Now this time, I want you to show what you can do!! Support the best guy! 
I will try to get Sips to vote on the 9 best entries. I don't know how he will vote, not sure if funny trumps artistic or the other way around, it's a mystery. Just create something amazing for the most amazing guy we know. If I can't get him to judge the prizes, I will. I have experience with both comedic writing and art and animation on a professional level. That being said, I hope that bastard agrees to judge! 

Here are the prizes and here's how it will go down. First place gets to choose first, then second place, third - all the way through to 9th place who will receive the steam code for the last game that hasn't been picked. 

So what are you waiting for. Animation, personal letter (text), song, remix, art - anything goes. Post it in THIS subreddit thread. If you don't post it here, it won't be alegable to win any of the prizes mentioned above. 

and most of all **HAVE FUN**

I know Ol' Sipsy no longer puts up minecraft videos, but I'm just craving some Big Women Big Fun Big Money action from the Sipsco Compound!

I would love for Sips and Sjin to revive their Minecraft series! 

A reboot would be fantastic.. Think about it, Sjin is working on his farm, and has given up the big corporate life that Sipsco offered him. Meanwhile, we can assume Sips has gone off the deep end and has spend all of Sipsco's money on none other then **BIG WOMEN**. He begs Sjin to come back to Sipsco to help rebuild the company. When Sjin returns, most of the compound is destroyed and Sips has locked himself on the top floor of Sipsco HQ. 

After the revival of Sipsco Dirt, Sjin goes back to the farm, leaving Sips to manage Sipsco once again. Sjin is able to use the *premium* dirt produced by Sipsco to make his farm the most bountiful. 

All of this, with the addition of a new rivalry between Sipsco and Honeydew Inc! 

Cmon you magnificent Bastards! Lets make this happen!

So I was just thinking about all the fantastic Game Dev Tycoon inspired games that people are making, and I thought, ""What if there was a game based on his Skyrim series?"" My mind immediately jumped to the bucket murderer. Then I started creating story, gameplay, etc. ideas in my mind because I had nothing better to do. Here's what I have so far.

Story: In ""To Place a Bucket,"" you play as a retired assassin living peacefully in an isolated house in the mountains of Skyrim. In your heyday, you killed your targets by stealthily placing a bucket over their heads and suffocating them/breaking their necks in a strategic location so that it seemed like a heavy bucket had fallen from its perch and iced whoever was below it. However, people started noticing that this was becoming less of a rarity, and to avoid suspicion, you retired and went into hiding.

Now, after all these years, it seems someone has unearthed your secret. There have been more reports of these strange bucket incidents, and the hunt for the bucket murderer is back on. You set out to stop this nonsense, breaking out the old bucket. You eventually find out that it is Princess Leia: the Dragonborn, the Archmage of the College of Winterhold, and the most fantastic lizard wizard prostitute in the lands to name a few, who has been framing you. Your thirst for revenge is greater than your thirst for justice, so you set out to eliminate her. 

Gameplay: I was picturing it as a pixellated sidescroller stealth game, kinda like Gunpoint, but with less... you know, guns. Each level would be a different bandit cave, or guard tower, or something like that. You would either have to interrogate someone or get rid of them. In the case of the latter, you would have to find the designated bucket and use it on the target. The former would be simpler: just get to the target and get the information from them, then kill them.

Throughout the rest of the level, normal buckets would be scattered everywhere. If you sneak up on an enemy while holding a bucket, you will silently kill them, and they will blend into their surroundings, making other guards not notice them. You can also use a dagger to silently kill them, but other guards will notice and search for you if they come across the body. You can also use the dagger in combat if you are detected, however it is not very effective and will attract nearby enemies.

That's basically what my mind was occupied with this whole evening. You may be wondering, if you even had the endurance to read through that whole text (if so, kudos to you) - what is the point of all this rambling? Well, it really is just that - rambling. I just thought I'd share this idea with you, through this subreddit, the only valid place to post it, in the safe hands of the buds. I don't know much about coding or making games, so if anyone who does sees this, you're welcome to use the idea if it interests you. But either way, thanks for reading all the way through this, seriously.",,False,,t5_2uts5,False,,11,True,t3_1io6xc,http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1io6xc/just_an_idea/,

fall damage, you have a pretty big range of damage-free drops but after that damage scales up quickly

armour, upgrade it, ya dumdum, copper is 1 def, you have the iron/silver/gold

npc's, the ones you have arrived because you completed tasks,
mike: get 50 silver helen: get extra health demo: find a bomb
the housing works with just the one door, but you need to do stuff for the npc's to show

Hell, if you look closely at the games background the walls change from dirt to dirt with stones to stones with dirt to stone to hell, You've only gotten to stones with dirt so far.

Goals
LIGHTSABER (AKA Phaseblade)
made in a range of colours depending on the gem you use
recipe 10 gems (amethyst), 2 meteorite bars, 
meteorite crashes onto the surface of your world, when one does you get a notification, the blocks burn you but you can mine them with the gold pick.
If you don't want them to burn you, you can make your own fireproof equipable item, but you need obsidian, from hell, bring a bucket

Achievement unlocked: Bad mother.

We've moved that list over to our [Sips Wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/wiki/index) so that everyone can edit and add new catchphrases as they come up (you can click the wiki link at the top of the page to get to it as well). 

You do need to be subscribed to this subreddit, have an account older than 20 days and have at least 200 subreddit karma in order to edit the page, but let us know if you think those rules are too stringent in the comments and they can be changed. 

Also, it might be helpful if when you are adding in a new catchphrase you also include a link to the video where it's from so that people who might get behind in their youtube watching or may miss a livestream will know exactly what to catch up on, or people can use it for a quick reference (that also goes for tweets as well).
