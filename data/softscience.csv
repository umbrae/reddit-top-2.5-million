My GF hates science programs. She would honestly rather watch American Idol than something science related.

But after reading about Carl Sagan's Cosmos (here on Reddit!), I decided to give it a watch. I convinced my GF to give it a chance because I heard it was pretty good.

The next 5 hours were us in absolute awe of this show, shaking our heads in pure stunned amazement. How could I not have known about this show? It was eventually my GF who was urging me ""just more more show! I love his voice!"" 

As old as this show is, I cannot believe how relevant and accurate it still is. What an absolute prophet this guy was! This has to be one of the best TV series I have ever seen in my life (including new science shows too). 

There are still loads of episodes left, and we plan to watch the rest of it tonight. Thanks Reddit, this is seriously one of the most amazing shows I have ever seen.

This series is something I will show my children before they even go to school. It pretty much covers everything.

This also means we will be watching ""Cosmos"" tonight, instead of American Idol.

1293660657.0,14,self.softscience,etb0e,Why did creatures in ancient history grow to be so large compared to today?,15,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/softscience/comments/etb0e/why_did_creatures_in_ancient_history_grow_to_be/,"I was reading a post about ""Which extinct creature would you bring back and why?"" and most of the creatures (except for the dinosaurs) were like creatures we have today, but MASSIVE.

So I'm wondering:

* Why did animals grow so large back then but not anymore?
* Why do large animals seems to die out?
* Why do we not have any fossil record of much larger humanoids?

I can totally believe that bipedal apes/monkeys/humanoids didn't show up until things had started shrinking, but it seems that if there were giants cats, deer, dogs, birds, lizards, armadillos and fish, that there would be some giant man-like creature.

1303167272.0,9,self.softscience,gt4dn,The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Dummies.  (or at least high school grads),12,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/softscience/comments/gt4dn/the_heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_for_dummies/,"DISCLAIMER: This is a gross simplification of the theory. Don't get all butt-hurt over inaccuracies, I originally typed this as a way to explain the principle to a friend who is going to school for art.  If any of this is poorly stated (could be said in a different way that is more accurate, but still easy enough to understand to anyone who has taken basic Algebra) please let me know.  People ask me to explain this all the time, so this is a Notepad document I've made to save me time.



I'm going to explain this using electrons, since people generally can picture electrons better than other ultra-small subatomic particles. Electrons, like all other forms of matter, behave likes waves. We did a calculation for fun in one of my physics classes to determine how slow you would have to walk through a doorway so that you diffract. (When light travels through a small hole, it doesn't head straight through, it bends into a diffraction pattern. Google has some cool images of diffraction patterns you can check out) Turns out it would take longer than the universe has been in existence, but it can happen in theory.

Electron orbitals are described using something called a wavefunction. Don't overcomplicate what that means. Let's pretend that an electron follows a simple trigonometric path, such as Psi = sin(x). A wavefunction is a probability function. If the value of the wavefunction is large, the electron will probably be there. If it is zero, it cannot be there. sin(x) has a maximum value at 90 degrees (pi/2) and repeats every 360 degrees (2pi). The electron has the greatest possibility of being at these maximum points, but there is nothing keeping it from being in a lower probability area.

Now assume you want to know EXACTLY where an electron is, what do you do? It has infinitely many possible positions. The answer is to add more terms to the wavefunction. Psi would become something like sin(x) + cos(x) - tan(x) + sin(2x).... Go grab your calculator and graph sin(x). Now graph sin(x) + cos(2x). Notice how when you add more terms, the spikes in the graph become much more pronounced near a certain location and decay very rapidly once you get away from that location. The more terms in the wavefunction, the more certain you are of the electrons position. Eventually you will get to a point where you are pretty sure about where that naughty electron is hanging out at that instant in time.

Now we get to part 2 of the problem. What is the momentum of this electron (how fast is it going)? The momentum of a wave is its wavelength (sorta, let's just pretend). OH SHIT!! The wavefunction we have from when we found the position has an infinite number of wavelengths, it changes at every point. What we can do is simplify the wavefunction by removing terms. (again, not really, but this is just a simple explanation) We go all the way back to our original wavefunction of Psi = sin(x). You'll know from your trig classes that the wavelength of sin(x) is 2pi. We now know that this electron has a momentum of 2pi.

The problem is, you can't do both at the same time. The more you try to analyze where a particle is, the less you can know about its momentum. Notice that this explanation never mentions physical lab equipment. Our inability to measure position and momentum is not because we suck at experimenting, it is a mathematical fact.

Excuse me in advanced for how disgusting the following article may be to some of our more skittish readers. However, I must say, this phenomena firmly cements my opinion that nothing (and I mean NOTHING) is more awesome than science.

Okay, lets get down to it. It's a little known fact (at least it is in regards to the pregnancy section in health textbooks) that most women defecate when they deliver a baby vaginally. If you didn't know that, my apologies. It isn't like it's something most people want to talk about. So don't feel too bad. Anyhow, this action makes sense, doesn't it? After all, delivering a baby requires lots and lots of pushing. Besides the obvious pushing and straining, a baby traveling through the birth canal has the tendency to compress the intestines, which causes whatever fecal matter that's present to fall out. As gross as it sounds, it actually serves a useful purpose.

To make this the least nauseating as possible, the colon and digestive tract of a newborn is free of bacteria when it's born. Exposure to the bacteria in your mother's fecal matter and bodily juices compensate for the colon being sterile at birth, which isn't ideal primarily because it leaves the baby unprotected against the various bacteria and germs it'll eventually have to fight later on in life. When the newborn is exposed to the bacteria, it creeps up to the newborn's colon and ""infects"" it, which prevents the baby from having to develop their own bacteria from breast milk and formula over the first few months of life. The bacteria you're exposed to is the bacteria that you're stuck with for the rest of your life.

So, what does this mean for you in the long run? There are several factors that determine how your feces and farts smell. Besides your diet and health, the bacteria your mother infected you with during childbirth greatly affects not only your bowel movements, but it also affects how your body digests certain foods . Thus, how your feces smells. In fact, babies that are born via Caesarean-section that aren't exposed to the various forms of bacteria that's transferred from the mother to the baby during childbirth are sometimes at risk for digestive problems throughout their life. 

Plus, research says that babies born via c-section are *sometimes* exposed to several problems that babies that are born vaginally aren't:

(More details about that here: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090629081443.htm)

I think we can count this one as a win for both woman-kind and evolution.

Hi reddit,

I need your help for science!

I'm running a live experiment for the Science Festival at the University of Cambridge (UK) this week, as part of a public lecture on the connectivity of brains and other networks. We will be mapping the network of twitter activity about the lecture itself, both during the lecture and ahead of time. To be part of this [beautiful network](http://comms.group.cam.ac.uk/sciencefestival/twitterbrain/), all you have to do is tweet (and more importantly, get people to re-tweet) with the tag #csftwitterbrain. 
Re-tweets are important because they will form the links in the network. I will post the results at the end of next week!

[Link to diagram](http://pics.webchimp.me.uk/tempincrease.PNG)

If you plot average daily temperatures on a bell curve then shade in an area of days that have temperatures over say 32°C(90°F), then move the bell curve over slightly to represent a 1°C increase in average temperatures the shaded area increases showing a larger number of hotter days.

I'm working on an underwater film experiment, and I'm trying to create a smokey or cloudy look in the water, similar to [this](http://www.jacobsutton.com/media/large/hh0951js_01-747_f3.jpg). It would need to fill a small section of an underground pool.

Basically, I'd love to figure out how to replicate a [smoke grenade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nix1UsWRLQU&amp;feature=related) look underwater, without doing any real damage to a swimming pool.

A few things that have come to mind are soda ash, and bath-bombs, but I don't think they would cloud as much as fizz. Fabric softener or a creamer of some sort might look really cool, but I'm not sure it would be that great for the pH level of the pool, or how much cleaning would be required afterwards. 

Any help or ideas would be incredible!

Ostensibly this is simply to have a good handle on how many publications are being produced, but the reality is that this is a control mechanism -- they have and will reject publications that do not fit with NASA's mission/scope, even if it is valid scientific research.  

Below is an e-mail I received recently (I work at NASA) -- some portions redacted to protect my identity.  

If a university were to require such things, everyone would be up in arms over it -- especially with such ""threats"" to ensure compliance.  It's insanity.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------

**From the local division chief:**

Please find the below guidelines for Document Availability Authorization (DAA) submissions.  Compliance with the DAA forms submission continues to attract high scrutiny at the Center and within the Directorate.  Whereas Earth Science is far from the worst offender, I want to point out that the guidelines below now include actions when DAA forms are not submitted.  These actions include travel cancellation and/or refusal to approve for page charges and conference registrations.  As long as procedures are followed, there is nothing to worry about, but I don't want anybody to be caught or surprised by the possible implications of non-compliance with these guidelines.


---------------------------------------------------------------


Scientific and Technical Information (STI) requirement for routing a Document Availability Authorization (DAA-NF1676). (Authors should coordinate with their respective office for proper routing and submission of the DAA and STI documents.)

 

·        Obtain approval of STI information prior to its submission.

·        A Popular Summary must be submitted for journal articles 

·        If a non-civil servant is releasing the information on behalf of NASA a DAA is required.

 

Failure to comply with DAA/STI submission procedures will result in the following:

              

·        Travel orders will not be processed.

·        Conference registrations and publication charges will not be submitted/paid.

 

Examples of STI include but are not limited to:

 

·        Journal articles

·        Meetings/conference papers

·        Presentations

·        Book/Book Chapters

 

 

Information that is exempt from the definition of STI:

Information published in policy documents such as NASA directives and NASA Technical, Engineering, or Safety Standards (NPD 8070.6, Technical Standards). 

Information published as a result of mishap investigations (NPR 8621.1, NASA Procedural Requirements for Mishap Reporting, Investigating, and Recordkeeping)

Proposal information marked with confidentiality notices furnished to NASA by contractors or grantees

New Technology Reports (NTR)/Invention Disclosures. [NOTE: While NTRs are not defined as STI, STI may include information that discloses an invention so it must be handled through the appropriate NASA intellectual property counsel.]

 
 

READ ON FOR MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS AND INFORMATION:

STI is the results (the analysis of facts and data, and the resulting conclusions) of basic and applied scientific, technical, and related engineering research and development. Examples include preliminary and final meeting/conference papers, presentation slides, journal articles, abstracts, extended abstracts, books and book chapters, STI Report Series (Technical Publications, Technical Memoranda, Contractor Reports, Special Publications, Technical Translations, Conference Publications), STI documents on public Web sites, and theses and dissertations related to an employee's official work.

We have coordinated with the STI office on a corrective action plan for compliance of DAA submissions on externally published NASA STI in response to the recent CASI review of various scientific and technical websites where over 50% of STI posted were not completed through the DAA review process.  **There will be another compliance check in January 2012 by the STI office.**  (Three commercially-produced publication databases are used to create a pool of externally published articles and conference papers where authors were affiliated with NASA. The rationale for this measure is that the NF 1676 process is required for externally published STI. All NASA Civil Servants are required to use this process to publish STI.  This measure assesses the level of awareness and compliance of Civil Servant authors in regards to the STI process with particular emphasis on journal articles and conference papers.)

Specifically, I like to eat tasty food, which lead me to cultivate an interest in gardening and edible plants, which lead me to companion planting, which lead me to composting, which lead me to soil science, at which point I stopped. I needed a stronger chemistry background to understand what I was reading, and my memories of learning chemistry were intertwined with memories of anguish and stress and nearly flunking the two Chem classes I had to take. Timidly, I made a few unfruitful attempts with my old chemistry books, but even a rudimentary understanding chemistry failed to take root.


While randomly poking around on the interwebs, I saw reviews for a very well regarded book called *Ignition!* on the history of rocket propellents, which, while not really so useful for the backyard gardener, sounded like a pretty cool way to dip my toes into a chemist's pool of knowledge. I mean, hey, who doesn't love spaceships, right? The catch was that the book is out of print and crazy expensive (400 for a used copy). The copyrights holder (the estate of the author) has no plans for a reprint, and rarely respond to inquires. This made me very sad. Fortunately, some kind and wonderful soul had a pdf version of the book that I was able to download (Kind and wonderful soul, if you are a redditor, thank you so much!).


Now I can't stop reading the book! John D Clark's tone is witty and the writing is quite informative. Although it takes me a while to get through each page, now I'm motivated to actually learn the chemistry I struggled over in school. Have any of you had similar experiences? What were the books that motivated you to learn something new?
