1348781213.0,82,self.Supplements,10l1mn,TrueNutrition Custom Mix Thread 2.0,85,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/10l1mn/truenutrition_custom_mix_thread_20/,"This is the updated thread from last year's [TrueProtein Custom Mix Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/hwotp/trueprotein_custom_mix_thread/). A few things have changed, mainly the company's name and apparently options in the custom mix list; a new thread was prudent (and asked for). Like usual, custom orders can be gained through [this link](http://www.truenutrition.com/p-1126-custom-mix.aspx) and the discount code (which *does* benefit me somewhat, outlined [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/hwe5i/i_found_a_site_that_will_let_you_make_a_custom/c1yxguv)) is KSF812. I believe it is 5% off.

Ever since the Whey Protein update on Examine ([here](http://examine.com/supplements/Whey+Protein/)) which goes into workout timing a fair bit, I have honestly strayed a bit away from intra-workout protein. This isn't to say intra-workout *nutrition* is useless, it would just be a bit more complicated and not protein based.

However, due to the research on protein timing I am going to have a new division of pre/intra workout mixes.

**Fasted Training** (Haven't eaten before the gym)

This is the only one where 'fast' proteins actually matter, since the speed of a protein source doesn't seem to really matter for muscle protein synthesis when in a fed state. The mixture is:

- Hydrolyzed Casein [Milk] 15% (Can use PeptoPro if desired, but is more expensive)
- Hydrolyzed Whey Protein High Grade [Milk] 25%
- Fructose 20%
- Dextrose 40%

And to be honest, I was going to make an 'additions' list for fasted training but cannot think of anything that would *per se* be awesome for fasting. Perhaps just look at the next two addition lists and borrow some ideas, and remember that your intestines may not be as motile after fasting so to take it slow when starting these things. Squat shits are not fun.

**Power** (Alertness and Cognition, without vomiting)

This one assumes you are eating at a caloric surplus (and thus, protein timing is less important in the grand scheme of things) but aims to give at least *some* nutrition during workouts. This shake itself isn't likely to do too much for muscle protein synthesis, but it may improve performance. It has been designed with heavy squats and cleans in mind, and should be easier on the stomach. The mix is:

- Whey Protein Isolate Microfiltrated [Milk] 40%
- Maltodextrin/Dextrose 40%
- Fructose 20%

Maltodextrin and Dextrose are interchangeable for this one, use Malto if sweetness churns your stomach and Dextrose if you like the sensation of sweetness. Be aware that whey isolate is a tad astringent and bitter. For Power training, also consider:

- A basic stimulant (caffeine works *only if* naive) or N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine (NALT); ephedrine is fine too, but may be banned by some organizations if you compete in Oly lifting
- A cholinergic (choline bitartrate is the simplest, Alpha-GPC the most fancy and expensive)
- If you want to Hydracetam that shit, a racetam such as Ani or Prami (not available on TrueNutrition, Smartpowders sells them); not advised for people starting to work out or supplement or for people not used to racetam compounds

**Endurance/Hypertrophy** (Nutrient focused, not as concerned with vomiting)

Same as the above, but slower absorbing (and less likely to pass the stomach faster) and would be better for longer workouts. It probably does just as much for muscle protein synthesis as the aforementioned power mix, minimal. Can still fuel a longer workout though. The mix is:

- Whey Protein Concentrate High Grade [Milk] 20%
- Calcium Caseinate [Milk] 20%
- Dextrose 10%
- Swedish Oat Starch 35%
- Psyllium Husk Seed fiber (under carbs) 5%
- Glutamine Peptides (under the fiber header) 10%

The glutamine is added for when people actually *do* prolong exercise to 2 hours or so; otherwise, enjoy your happy intestines. The dextrose is added for hopefully quick absorption (if not buccal) and the rest is designed to somewhat sit in your stomach. Also consider:

- Citrulline, although the dose required for statisically significant benefits is something like 6-8g and may be financially steep
- Beta-Alanine
- Sodium Bicarbonate, for the love of god low-ball the dose on this lest you shit yourself (This is Baking soda, you can get this at the grocery store)

**Other Notes**

- All mixes are *not* designed to fuel you after the workout, just during; this is a reason why the protein is relatively low. Thus, eat something after your workout. Food works well.

- I omitted a health mixture because, in all honesty, food works better. If you want a health shake and food cannot work, get a veggie/greens mixture and throw it in some whey concentrate with psyllium husk powder. Done.

- Due to TrueNutrition no longer using compounds that are not protein, carbs, or MCTs in their mixes these things are quite basic and diluted down to their proteins. As such, the amount you need is reduced as well. TrueNutrition usually sends scoops along with orders, but 1-2 is *plenty* for this; most of your nutrition should be coming along in meals anywho, this is just to get you through the workout",,False,,t5_2qhb8,1348781655.0,,,True,t3_10l1mn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/10l1mn/truenutrition_custom_mix_thread_20/,
1307739997.0,74,self.Supplements,hwotp,TrueProtein Custom Mix Thread,92,18,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/hwotp/trueprotein_custom_mix_thread/,"I was recently asked (In the TrueProtein thread) if I would propose custom supplements depending on goals. I decided to make a quick post about it.

Aside from the Meal Replacement, all of these were formulated with Pre-workout and Intra-workout in mind. You can just eat good food after the workout.

Basically, these ingredients can be formulated through [this](http://www.truenutrition.com/p-1126-custom-mix.aspx) link:

**Bodybuilding:**

-	Hydrolyzed Whey Protein Supergrade (20%)
-	Soy Protein Isolate non-GMO (20%)
-	Fructose (10%)
-	Dextrose (20%)
-	L-Leucine by the Pound (10%)
-	Acetyl-L-Carnitine by the Pound (5%)
-	Creapure by the Pound (5%)
-	Citrulline Malate by the Pound (10%)

$10.26 per pound

As many scoops as desired before and during the workout, as long as it doesn’t impair actual workout performance. Basically just getting substrate into your body and letting the muscle contractions do the rest.

A note on Soy protein Isolate. The isolate form is so processed and detract from foods that it really isn’t soy anymore, it’s just a solution of amino acids. (This is why it is used as a control in most scientific research on different protein types; there is nothing fancy about Isolate aside from being a solution of amino acids). I put it in for economy and the fact that all I really wanted was extra amino acids (so why spring for more expensive amino acids?), but if you want you may replace it with more Hydrolyzed Whey Protein SuperGrade or Whey Protein concentrate.

**Powerlifting:**

-	Hydrolyzed Whey Protein Supergrade (30%)
-	Amylocel (Wazy Maize Starch) (20%)
-	Fructose (10%)
-	Dextrose (15%)
-	Acetyl-L-Carnitine by the Pound (5%)
-	Creapure by the Pound (10%)
-	Citrulline Malate by the Pound (10%)

$10.90 per pound

1-2 scoops should suffice. I mainly just chose this mix with neural efficacy in mind and not vomiting during a 1RM attempt (as, if you look at the protein and carb choices, they all pass the stomach fairly quickly)

**Muscular Endurance (Crossfit, etc.)**

-	Calcium Caseinate (20%)
-	Hydrolyzed Casein (10%)
-	Amylocel (Waxy Maize Starch) (20%)
-	Fructose (10%)
-	Maltodextrin (10%)
-	Acetyl-L-Carnitine (5%)
-	Creapure (5%)
-	Citrulline Malate (20%)

$14.69 per pound, but thankfully only 1 scoop is really needed for an hour or so.

Same idea as powerlifting in order to make it more stomach-happy, but then gave a focus to fuelling the body for a longer period of time. So essentially slow intestinal release and fast gastric digestion (casein and WMS). Added in a buttload of Citrulline Malate for the higher volume of work done.

It might be good to buy Beta-Alanine on its own, since it cannot be added in custom mix.

**Meal Replacement:**

-	Rice Protein concentrate non-GMO (20%)
-	Gemma Protein Pea isolate non-GMO (20%)
-	Whey protein concentrate (20%)
-	Taurine by the pound (5%)
-	Acetyl-L-Carnitine by the pound (5%)
-	L-Glutamine by the pound (10%)
-	Psyllium seed husk fiber (10%)
-	Medium Chain Triglyceride powder (10%)

$8.35 per pound

Formulated with health and economy  in mind. This shake is most likely going to be nice and thick after you prepare it, so be forewarned (Gemma Pea Protein and Psyllium)

**Flavoring Agents, Packaging, and other additives**

Packaging is either a large-ass thick plastic bag or a jug. Both are minimally labelled but the jug is priced more but, in my opinion, only serves the purpose of getting less ‘WTF is that?’ stares from your family than a big bag of protein would.

If you have money to burn, spring for the CEC / PEC / Vitamin / electrolyte mix, but it costs an extra $2.70 per pound. At minimum I would add the Electrolyte mix, and possibly Protein Enzyme Complex / Electrolytes if you want to aid stomach digestion even further (as the workout protocols are designed to be pre/intra workout stuff anyways).

Choose your artificial sweetener and flavouring of choice. The only thing to note here is that although all flavours (that I have tasted) are good, the ones that are naturally fatty in nature (such as peanut butter, chocolate, or cheesecake) will taste ‘off’ if not paired with dietary fats. Having these during a workout with no dietary fats will be sort of a weird taste experience, and thus I would recommend something more berry-like for workouts. 

*Discount Code*

For an extra 5% off, use the code KSF812 on your checkout. It is a personal code that does potentially benefit me (I explained it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/hwe5i/i_found_a_site_that_will_let_you_make_a_custom/c1yxguv)) so use it if you wish.

**Edit**

Since this thread is still alive to some. A while ago there was notification that some credit card numbers were leaked from TrueProtein. They seem to, for the most part, have eliminated the thread. However, this also happened in the past and they also claimed to have eliminated the threat this time.

I do not know the details of what happened, nor whether it will happen in the future (I doubt). That being said, it may be advisable to use PayPal or a Virtual Credit Card. Not many numbers were taken when you look at the overall amount of people who buy from TrueProtein, but this is still something you don't want to risk.

**Double Edit** (07/09/11)

For the past two months there have been no reported credit card number losses from ordering from TrueProtein to my knowledge.

**Triple Edit** (07/11/11)

Flavour Log, for those wondering and by yours truly:

- Key Lime Pie is godly for workouts; not too sour and does taste like limes (works with both sugared drinks and non-sugared drinks) Citrus Lime-ade is a bit tangier but still great.

- Dutch chocolate fudge is very chocolately, and works best with both sugars and fats (meal replacements); the other chocolates (banana, orange, mint) are all good, but the chocolate mint makes a great morning wake-up shooter (face really feels it)

- Strawberry Banana and Strawberry Cheesecake both taste mostly like strawberries, Orange Creamsicle does taste like an orange creamsicle but a diluted one if not paired with sugars

- Chocolate chip cookie dough, Cookies n' Cream, and Creamy Peanut butter are excellent to overcome the milky taste of bulk casein and whey protein (unflavored and unsweetened protein)",,False,,t5_2qhb8,True,,,True,t3_hwotp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/hwotp/trueprotein_custom_mix_thread/,

Because of that, I am first announcing here that I have begun a new role as nutritionist and formulator at a startup supplement company called SunDaily.  I started working with them back when it was just an idea for a company and developed their first few formulas starting in 2012.  What started as some short term assignments has now turned into a much more exciting opportunity that will allow me to use all of the research I have been doing and develop advanced new formulas in a way that I want.  The Founder (/u/the_wonda) and I share a common vision for advancing many of the boring traditional products out there and some other commonalities (hatred for ridiculous marketing claims), and now I have the opportunity to consolidate my research into specialized products (so, yay!)

Announcement of the role can be seen on SunDaily’s [blog](http://sundailyhealth.com/blog/Announcing-Kurtis-Frank-as-an-Official-Founding-Member-of-SunDaily/) and on the [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sundailyhealth) page.
 
I want to be clear that Examine and SunDaily will continue to be run independently of one another.  One will not be used to promote the other.  I think there will be mutual benefits of staying involved with the research community and a company that makes real products.

I'm open to answer questions regarding SunDaily (or anything else because I'm beta), our product philosophy, my role there,  what my goals are/ what I plan to do or anything else.

Vitamin D is going to get a ton of attention because its Vitamin D, but Licorice is too weird of a compound to not get a fair bit of attention.

Aditionally, many isolated studies of licorice components are bloody amazing yet there are fatal flaws with them. In no specific manner:

- Glycyrrhetic Acid is completely different than any other compound in licorice, and should be considered its own standalone molecule. This molecule has been linked to reductions in testosterone and increases in cortisol, the other flavanoids and Glabridin are just standard plant polyphenols and do the same general shit

Edit: For those of you who previously read ""reductions in testosterone and increases in testosterone""; sorry, I'm retarded

- The 'test reduction', to be honest, is not too statistically sound. Three unblinded studies of low sample size, and they basically follow the trend of ""Shit bro, GA halves your test (next guy: no, it doesn't reduce test at all) *fine*, it quarters your test"". Despite similar methodology, three very different effect sizes

- High doses *very* reliably increase cortisol, doses under 500mg don't seem to have much of an effect (Glycyrrhetic acid, not Licorice per se). Heck, low doses may theoretically reduce cortisol

- Yeah, *technically* GA is about half as potent as a mitochondrial uncoupler as 2,4-DNP. This **clearly doesn't** appear to be present in interventions with oral GA, probably due to plasma binding to albumin (ie, it gets into your blood but doesn't actually leave your blood into fat tissue)

- Licorice flavanoid oil (components of licorice when Glycyrrhetic Acid was taken out) appears to be a relatively potent aromatase inhibitor, due to a variety of compounds as well.

- Glycyrrhetic acid appears to augment signaling via Beta2adrenergic receptors. It has historical usage as an anti-asthmatic augmentor (not monotherapy) and given the importance of B2A receptors for this this ability of GA might be biologically plausible. That being said, no *in vivo* evidence on this; it is plausible GA is synergistic with beta-2-adrenergic agonists pending more research, which would be quite an astonishing result actually (for those wondering, it reduces the rate of receptor internalization upon ligand binding; a huge limitation of adrenergic receptors).

- Technically glabridin is a nootropic (enhancing learning in animals that do not have cognitive impairment) but I would not put too much faith in this. It was a high dose used, and the effect size was not too impressive compared to other compounds

- Liquirtigenin and Isoliquirtigenin are amazing SERMS; they act on the beta subunit while antagonising the alpha subunit (a good modulation for weightlifters) in the nanomolar concentrations

- It appears to have potent CYP3A4 inhibitory potential, and I would not be surprised if drug-drug interactions existed with licorice flavanoids

In regards to *all* effects of Licorice, all I can say is that it is a good research compound. Topical application of GA could potentially be useful to circumvent plasma binding, but [this fucking study exists](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17982260) and I'm scared of putting it on my myocytes. 

All I can really stand behind right now is the usage of Deglycyrrhizinated (without Glycyrrhizin and Glycyrrhetic Acid) Licorice Flavanoid Oil for the purposes of beneficially influencing estrogen, due to its combined SERM and AI effects; not as potent as pharmaceuticals again, but it appears to be more potent than many nutraceutical options.",,False,,t5_2qhb8,1355259749.0,,,True,t3_14nw7m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/14nw7m/glycyrrhiza_glabra_licorice_or_as_i_like_to_call/,

Edit: Buying Smartpowder's Totalis and Creatine separately and then taking half the recommended dosage of Totalis with 5g/day of Creatine might actually be cheaper long term. Alternatively you could add any missing ingredients to the Totalis (Creatine, Choline, Inositol, Theanine, Taurine) for a super mix.

Totals: $283-&gt; $328/year

**Personally what I would consider doing: Go with 1000g Beta-Alanine, 500g Choline Citrate, 400g Inositol, +all the other ingredients (obviously).**

Grand Total Then: **$316/year** before discounts, about $10 cheaper after discounts.

All you would need on top of this is protein powder methinks (available at smartpowders/trueprotein for cheap as hell), as you'd even have your ""Pump"" pretty much covered via Citrulline, Tyrosine, ALCAR, and Choline. I guess you could also get more of a lot of the aminos (for those of you who dose 5-10g Creatine, 5-10g Beta-Alanine, 3-5g Citrulline, etc). But I picked out all the ingredients I could within the same price range of AnimalPak, so yeah. Although the functionality of this stack sure as hell beats AnimalPak, because *damn is it expensive*.

For those of you in the UK/Europe I would say try and compare prices between [MyProtein](http://www.myprotein.com/uk/) and SP/True Protein/iHerb and see what comes out cheaper after shipping.

-------------------------

If you're looking to go cheapo with the stack:

1000 caps Fish Oil, Vitamin D3+K2, Vitamin K1, Magnesium, 500g Choline, 200g Inositol, 1000g Creatine, 500g ALCAR, 500g Taurine, 1000g Beta-Alanine: $217/year (less than half the price of AnimalPak).

-----------------------------

How to mix everything: 

Pre-workout Pump: Creatine, Beta-Alanine, Choline, ALCAR, Tyrosine, (optionally) half the Inositol

KEEP THE CITRULLINE SEPARATE! IT WILL CLUMP UP THE PRE-WORKOUT OTHERWISE! BUT TAKE IT AT THE SAME TIME.

Post-workout (or even pre-bedtime): Inositol, Theanine, Taurine

Taken together in the morning (fat soluble): Fish Oil, Coenzyme Q10, Vitamin D3+K2, Vitamin K1

Whenever you want: Zinc, Magnesium

Before bed: Melatonin (you can take Magnesium and Zinc at this time too)

Best with meals: Multivitamin

Don't take before sleep: Choline, ALCAR, Tyrosine, Vitamin D, Creatine


----------

In terms of *actual* mixing, I mix everything together into 3 month batches, shake the shit out of them (and occasionally even sift them), and then stir them up real good before taking anything. I have a 5mL scoop that I use to measure out stuff and I weight how much 1 scoop is of the stuff and then scale up from there (usually works out to about two scoops of the pre-workout and 1 scoop of the bed time mix)",,False,,t5_2qhb8,1371874579.0,,,True,t3_iw94v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/iw94v/my_alternative_to_animalpak_for_you/,

DrivenSports was once Designer Supplements. Designer drugs (Such as prohormones) are synthetic drugs that people get away with selling...

Designer Supplements was selling some of these designer steroids... They turned into DrivenSports...

Matt Cahill is the guy behind DS Craze. He was in prison for selling DNP (a weight loss drug / metabolic poison) that eventually killed one of his customers. In that same case it appears he was dealing multiple substances (steroids, ecstasy, etc) and mailing them out.

Many people speculate that the original formula was spiked with a synthetic stimulant not listed in the formula. Some claim the formula has never changed.

To add to the confusion someone made fake batches of DS craze and got them on the shelves. I think this was mostly just in europe...

In a thread on ThermoLife someone believes n-benzyl-2-phenethylamine  &amp; N-ethyl-Beta-Methylphenylethylamine may be in the formula.

The naming convention &amp; packaging of craze makes it impossible for anyone to understand whats in it. Try googling the PEA-like compounds and see what you can find. Probably very little! There is also little information on Dendrobium making it a good way to say it is ""all natural"".

By modifying PEA people can produce powerful drugs that require low doses. Many of these drugs are new and unsafe.

There are claims that Matt Cahill has sold fake/mislabled products in the past.

""If selling fake products like 3,4 Divanil http://www.thermolife.com/forum/thread1265.html and fake Turkersterone or destroying 1000's of peoples livers with Superdrol werent enough there is always this""

This guy seems very shady &amp; his product is extremely questionable!

- The mechanism if amazing, it seems. Increasing dendritic proliferation is the definition of a non-stimulatory way to increase neural potential over a long period of time. Rather than needing to cycle, this one seems to be a build-up effect of cognition

---------------------

This time I'm looking to do a replacement for both [Jack3d](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/usp/jacked.html) and [White Flood](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/clabs/flood.html) but for a bit cheaper and hopefully more effective. A 45 day supply of Jack3d (at 1scoop/day) is $28, which totals to $224 for the year, and 400 servings of White flood (which I think is the superior product) comes to a total of $160 at BB.com.

Given ~$250 to work with for a year's supply I'm going to try to go through a list of stuff that I think would be beneficial for a good pump, while being cost effective and hopefully better than either of the products, and providing better dosing. (Although personally I'm not comfortable supplementing with DMAA, especially for prolonged periods).

Now this might count as cheating a bit but one thing I'd like to include a bit of Scivation Xtend to the preworkout. It contains BCAAs, Glutamine, a bit of Citrulline, Electrolytes, Vitamin B6 and also some flavouring to boot. It's not necessary especially if you're not training fasted, but it's not a bad set of ingredients and it tastes delicious =D

------------------

[2500g of Scivation Xtend](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-7628-original-xtend-sale.aspx) for $78 (optional but awesome, my favourite is watermelon flavour, followed by blue raspberry)

[500g of ALCAR](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5238-acetyl-l-carnitine-powder-500-grams.aspx) for $18

[500g of Beta-Alanine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-6071-beta-alanine-500-g-176-oz.aspx) for $22 (you can double this up)

(I wouldn't personally include this) [400 caps of 20mg DMAA](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5366-13-dimethylamylamine-200-caps-20mg.aspx) for $28

[400g of Caffeine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5261-caffeine-anhydrous-400-grams.aspx) for $13 (only using between 73-146g of Caffeine for 200-400mg per serving)

[500g of Choline Citrate](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5268-choline-citrate-500-grams.aspx) for $12

[750g of Citrulline](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5273-citrulline-malate-powder-75-grams.aspx) for $45

[1000g of Creatine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5280-creatine-monohydrate-powder-1000-grams.aspx) for $12 (you can add more of this too)

[20g of Theanine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5327-l-theanine-powder-20-grams.aspx) for $7

[500g of Tyrosine](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5331-l-tyrosine-powder-500-grams.aspx) for $14 (you could also go for only [200g](https://www.smartpowders.com/p-5330-l-tyrosine-powder-200-grams.aspx) for $8)

[400g of Inositol](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5315-inositol-200-grams.aspx) or something) for $20 (you could also go for only 200g)

Total Cost: $241. Cheaper than Jack3d by quite a bit.

------------------

If you mix all of these supplements together in a big batch (excluding DMAA and only including 73-146g Caffeine) you end up with 6743-6816g of product, totaling to: 18.5-18.7g/day (+20mg DMAA if you include it)

All of this provides approximately:

5mg Vitamin B6, 1.7g Leucine, 1.2g Glutamine, 0.8g Isoleucine, 0.8g Valine, 2.5g Citrulline, 1.4g ALCAR, 20mg DMAA (I wouldn't use it), 0.2-0.4g Caffeine, 1.4g Choline Citrate (~0.5g Choline), 2.7g Creatine(can double), 55mg Theanine, 1.4g Tyrosine(can half), 1.4g Beta-Alanine(can double), 1.1g Inositol(can half).

---------------------------

I'd imagine this product is even better than 2 scoops of Jack3d or 2 servings of Whiteflood (with some benefits and some negatives, the major benefit being price and moar ingredients). There will probably be much less of the crazy jitteriness that a lot of people get from taking Jack3d (especially if you took out the DMAA). The addition of Theanine reduces a lot of the negative symptoms of Caffeine, because the two work in unison and prevent problems associated with taking too much of either. Some of the ingredients I included simply because you can find them in Whiteflood, but they might also be pretty helpful for ""the pump"" (GABA/Gluocronolactone). Some ingredients compete for absorption a bit (Tyrosine and the BCAAs), but there is a fairly substantial amount of them to allow for a decent amount of absorption of them.

-------------------

Yep, so there you go. If you have any questions or comments, or if you have any suggestions for additions.

------------------------------

**If you want to go as cheap and as barebones as possible and/or in larger proportions**:

500g Choline Citrate, 500-1000g Beta-Alanine, 1000-2000g Creatine, 500g ALCAR, 73-146g Caffeine, 375-750g Citrulline, 200-400g Inositol, 200-500g Tyrosine,
Total = $105-$168 (+maybe Theanine if you want to prevent problems from Caffeine)

-------------------

GPLC, NALT and Alpha-GPC are quite expensive compared to ALCAR/Tyrosine/Choline Citrate, which is why they weren't included in the mixes above But if you can afford it, go for it.  You can make the switch to choline citrate (1-1.5g Choline Citrate instead of 0.5g Alpha-GPC), 1:1 for Tyrosine/NALT, and ALCAR (1.25g ALCAR instead of 1.25g GPLC). If you're cheap, but don't add them to the pre-sleep stack! ALCAR and Choline Citrate both have stimulatory effects at night that small amounts ofgplc/alpha-gpc

1369074936.0,28,self.Supplements,1epjif,Agmatine: Examine update and discussion (shit might be whack),36,8,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1epjif/agmatine_examine_update_and_discussion_shit_might/,"So I was having fun these last two weeks with a few updates, and [agmatine](http://examine.com/supplements/Agmatine/) surprised me. This may be added to the short-list of 'compounds that I did not expect to be awesome yet are' (that shortlist consists of spirulina and berberine, probably agmatine now as well).

**Mechanisms?**

It's a neurotransmitter, literally. It is central to the whole 'agmatinergic' system of the brain.

The role of agmatine in the agmatinergic system is to modulate NMDA glutaminergic receptors (technically enhances it at low doses, but higher doses associated with supplements or merely neuronal activation likely block some signalling), and it is inhibitory against the nitric oxide synthase enzyme (NOS) that products nitric oxide.

It seems to only quell NOS when it is overactive, so this likely is protective in periods when NOS would normally fuck your brain over (neurotoxicity tends to do this) or when you are pharmacologically trying to enhance NOS activity, like if you had a norvaline/citrulline combination supplement as a preworkout (statement redacted: I have no clue how it affects pumps)

It also enhances serotonergic signalling and ultimately inhibits potassium channels indirectly via that, and it appears to be a direct calcium channel blocker as well.

The two *main* mechanisms of action are activating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (antagonistic of yohimbine) and activating imidazoline receptors (as far as nutraceuticals go, it is fairly unique to agmatine).

**Uses?**

The most promising usage IMO would be for neuropathic pain, since aside from being dose-dependently effective for it in isolation it also augments the efficacy of both opioids (morphine) and marijuana (via enhancing cannabinoid signalling).

And yes, I just said that agmatine enhances cannabinoid signalling; the receptor (CB1) is the one mediating the neurological effects of marijuana. What you do with this knowledge is not my business, but inform me if it turns out well please :)

Beyond those two, it is just a general drug synergist. It appears to enhance the efficacy of SSRIs and serotonin antidepression (similar to both sAME and creatine; this is the third supplement on examine to be implicated in augmenting SSRIs) and enhances all opioidergic drugs tested. It appears to abolish the anxiety caused by alcohol withdrawal, and some limited evidence suggests that a mechanism of nicotine addiction is ablated with agmatine.

Due to the interactions with nicotine, alcohol, and reducing the addictive properties of opioids (fentanyl and morphine) it is said that agmatine is antiaddictive. I would have to agree.

Beyond the analgesic and antiaddictive properties, it is highly neuroprotective (particularly against stroke) and has notable potential against excitotoxicity. If I had to classify it as either depressant or stimulant, the mechanisms are more in line with a depressant (although there is no evidence that it causes sedation, so it isn't anything like theanine).

There are mixed effects on memory formation with agmatine. It appears to stimulate activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (suggesting memory enhancement) but although it has been linked to increasing memory it does *not* appear to enhance spatial memory (water maze task) and it actually appears to be negative against emotional fear based conditioning (this might be a good thing to some people). I saw a few authors mentioning it is likely positive for cognition when looking at 'higher cognition' but either inert or inhibitory against emotional stuff, but I'm honestly waiting on some more applicable human studies for that.

**Downsides?**

Firstly, so much damn research is using injections. There are limited studies using oral intake (but it does appear to work with oral intake in those studies). There is no study on bioavailability yet, but the oral doses aren't too far off from the injection dosages. That, and it uses the same transporters as arginine/ornithine and since those things get saturated at 10g a 0.5-2g dose of agmatine is likely well absorbed.

Also, many of its effects are ablated by blocking the a2A receptor or by stimulating nitric oxide. Due to this, it is likely antagonistic (ie. not good) to consume agmatine alongside either yohimbine/rauwolscine and citrulline/arginine.

Finally, there is one human study. Just one. It showed awesome effects with higher dose agmatine against neuropathic pain but there is a problem. Agmatine is dose-depedendent for that, whereas for many cognitive effects (anxiety and depression mostly) it follows a bell curve in rats. I estimated that the highest dose one should use for cognition is 500mg, but due to the lack of human evidence I cannot be sure.

Other cognitive effects such as memory, it is not clear if it is dose dependent or not.",,False,,t5_2qhb8,1369085062.0,,,True,t3_1epjif,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1epjif/agmatine_examine_update_and_discussion_shit_might/,

1358566048.0,34,self.Supplements,16uvt1,"Responded to a thread about Animal Pak, decided the response is worthy of its own thread: Why I have an issue with Animal Pak and other popular daily packs. ",48,14,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/16uvt1/responded_to_a_thread_about_animal_pak_decided/,"Foreword: This is a response I had wrote in another thread about Animal Pak's effectiveness. IMO, this pertains to just about every supplement you see on the market today; I've posted this as a separate thread to raise some awareness of common industry practices that may be misleading the customer about just exactly what they're taking. Without further adieu;

My opinion is just *slightly* biased because I own a company that competes directly with animalpak's product. HOWEVER, I really think that overall, it's poorly formulated. There are a few tricks/legal loopholes that supplement companies can use to fluff their labels to make it seem like you're getting a hell of a lot more ingredient than you are - the reality of it, though, is that the ingredient does not have to be readily bioavailable or active. You'll see that alot in some of the most popular daily vitamins (looking at you OT) and packs on the market today. Keep this in mind, but it's very difficult to spot any of these loopholes without a lot of knowledge in 1) chemistry and 2) FDA labeling guidelines/regulations.  

My biggest issues with animal pak are the following:

* Vitamin D is obnoxiously low. we're all aware of the benefits of higher vitamin D consumption and a true daily pack should mean you don't have to go out and buy another Vit D supplement to supplement your supplement, nomsayin? 
* The entire B-complex is dosed extremely high. This may have not been a big deal if you weren't suppose to take this supplement daily - however, if you're taking it daily for extended periods of time I highly suggest you take a look at this: http://psa-rising.com/eatingwell/vb12_folate04.html (links to study in article). There's absolutely no reason that the B-complex of vitamins should be dosed this high. It's just putting unnecessary stress on your body to process and dispose of these excess vitamins. I believe they've dosed it this high due to the reported ""rush"", ""clarity"" &amp; ""energy"" b6+b12 bring you when taking in mega-doses. 
* 400mg of magnesium oxide taken at once is a laxative ;)
* the mineral portion of this product are poorly bioavailable as sulfates. At this day and age, in a quality product, they should be Amino Acid Chelates. 
* Zinc in oxide form is poorly bioavailable compared to other various forms (sulfate, methenione, AAC, picolinate) 
* Selenium should be L-Selenomethionine for proper bioavailability. 
* Amino Acid Complex is just 6 grams of Whey Protein Concentrate (listed as the subsequent amino acid breakdown of whey). This kind of thing really turns me off. What it is: cheap WPC, what they want you to think it is: advanced, homeopathic mixture of amino acids that will cause some sort of amazing effect on yo gains bruh.
* Performance Complex has quite a few fluffer ingredients, so underdosed that they wont actually do anything. These include: Carnitine, Hawthorne Berry, Oriental Ginseng ROOT (**Not the extract!!**)
* Anti-Oxident Complex is 60% fluff ingredients. Sadly, the most important ingredients on the list are all **significantly underdosed** these are: CoQ10: 5mg; Grape Seed Extract: 50mg; Lutein: 1mg; The majorly important ingredient in this section is CoQ10, and it's worthless at 5mg. 
* Digestive Enzyme Complex: Bromelain is not reported correctly. The efficacy of bromelain is measured by GDU (Gelatin Dissolving Units). There is no mention of the concentration of GDU in this bromelain. The cost differentiation between a low gdu bromelain and a high gdu bromelain can be 8x as much for the same amount of overall bromelain. Any good businessman knows if they're not saying how many gdu, they're at the cheapest dose. Even at the purest form of bromelain with an extremely high (2000+) gdu count, 100mg is not clinically enough to help digestion. Inulin aids good and bad bacteria in the gut - I don't prefer its use, seems redundant to me. Lipase is actively measured in LU (lipase activity units). There is no specification of how many LU this 10mg provides; According to UMM an adult should take a daily sum total of 18,000 LU of lipase per day to see beneficial effects. 

These are just some of the more glaringly obvious things I have a problem with in this formulation. I'm really tired of the hidden dishonesty of supplement companies trying to fluff their labels and mislead their customer base. A good daily supplement should consist of three things: 1) bioavailable, quality sources of vitamins and minerals, 2) only include herbal supplements dosed EFFECTIVELY according to clinical studies. 3) not need to be supplemented with other individual daily vitamins to be optimally effective. 

Above all else, the best customer is an educated customer. These poor formulation practices end when the customer refuses to settle for subpar ingredients and demands a better quality supplement. It means less profit margins for business owners like myself, but it means a healthier, more honest industry as a whole - that's worth it.

And there is definitely some complaints with in all the praise.

Mainly complaints about increased acne and hair loss. Then there is this research:

___________________________________________________________________________________

Objective: This study investigated resting concentrations of selected androgens after 3 weeks of creatine supplementation in male rugby players. It was hypothesized that the ratio of dihydrotestosterone (DHT, a biologically more active androgen) to testosterone (T) would change with creatine supplementation.

Design: Double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study with a 6-week washout period.

Setting: Rugby Institute in South Africa.

Participants: College-aged rugby players (n = 20) volunteered for the study, which took place during the competitive season.

Interventions: Subjects loaded with creatine (25 g/day creatine with 25 g/day glucose) or placebo (50 g/day glucose) for 7 days followed by 14 days of maintenance (5 g/day creatine with 25 g/day glucose or 30 g/day glucose placebo).

Main Outcome Measures: Serum T and DHT were measured and ratio calculated at baseline and after 7 days and 21 days of creatine supplementation (or placebo). Body composition measurements were taken at each time point.

Results: After 7 days of creatine loading, or a further 14 days of creatine maintenance dose, serum T levels did not change. However, levels of DHT increased by 56% after 7 days of creatine loading and remained 40% above baseline after 14 days maintenance (P &lt; 0.001). The ratio of DHT:T also increased by 36% after 7 days creatine supplementation and remained elevated by 22% after the maintenance dose (P &lt; 0.01).

Conclusions: Creatine supplementation may, in part, act through an increased rate of conversion of T to DHT. Further investigation is warranted as a result of the high frequency of individuals using creatine supplementation and the long-term safety of alterations in circulating androgen composition.

Statement of Clinical Relevance: Although creatine is a widely used ergogenic aid, the mechanisms of action are incompletely understood, particularly in relation to dihydrotestosterone, and therefore the long-term clinical safety cannot be guaranteed.

**#As background:**

Male, 33, have been lifting weights for about 4 years now. This time last year, I was diagnosed with both an inguinal hernia and a [varicocele](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele). I had the hernia repaired but not the varicocele (not covered by insurance), but at the time I had blood testosterone tests as well as sperm tests (as varicocele is implicated in lowering male testosterone and having poorer quality sperm). My diet at the time was a cut, and my preferred method is to mix Protein Sparing Modified Fast style eating (2-3 days at a time) with ad libitum eating for one meal every few days (usually high carb and post squats/DL's). I was also drinking quite heavily (read &gt;30 pints of strong lager per week). I'd had at least 6 pints the night before the first blood test.


Fast forward about a year, I decided to quit the booze and get back on my diet. Given I was forsaking one of my great pleasures (getting absolutely hammered) I thought I'd start supplementing with testosterone boosters and then get my bloodwork and sperm analysed again. For the 5 weeks on this protocol I drank no alcohol whatsoever, trained daily (powerlifting), followed the same diet as above and slept 8+ hours per night. During the 5 weeks I lost around 6-7lbs of bodyweight and 6% body fat (using Navy calculation method). Strength on my lifts went up (didn't try 1RMs, but hit significant improvements on volume, and all numbers went up). I'm in approximately the same shape I was when the tests were taken last year (~15% body fat).

**#The Results: Bloodwork**

| Hormone  | Before | After      | Reference                |
|:---------|--------|---------|----------------------|
| FSH Male | 4.1      | 3.8       | 1.9-13 IU/L               |
| ICSH       | 6.45    | 2.75      | 1.50-9.30 IU/L          |
| T-free     | 15.80   | 15.30    | 8.40-28.70 nmol/L     |
| T-total    | 455.36 | 440.95   | 242.09-827.13 nmol/L|
| Prolactin  | 0.27    | 0.53      | 0.09-0.76 nmol/L       |
| Prolactin  | 6.21    | 12.18     | 2.07-17.47 ng/mL      |


So, as you can see this didn't exactly set the world on fire - free testosterone and total testosterone both dropped (but only marginally). Not quite sure what to make of the other results, but I didn't think the prolactin was a good sign. Please feel free to educate me here.


**#The Results: Spunk Swim Test**

| Parameter    | Before       | After         | Reference Range        |

| Morphology%| 1%           | 6%            | 5+% fertile               |

Remarks; teratozoospermia in both cases (large heads on my spunk apparently)

So, the pills/booze ban managed to get a 50% increase in my spunk volume and more than 100% increase in the number of sperm per ml of spunk. There was also an improvement in the number of normal looking jizz swimming around in the sample too. Looks like the number moving forward dropped a bit (not that it matters as the absolute number going in the right direction will have gone up substantially).


Sadly I have no interest in fathering a child, so I was really hoping to see a much bigger improvement in the hormones and not too bothered about the changes in sperm. 


**TL;DR** Gave up booze and took T boosters. Got no boost in T but marginal improvement in jizz quality. Going to go to the pub and get hammered, as it evidently doesn't impact my hormone levels.

**EDIT** just looked up prolactin, and the elevated levels in the second test could be due to the fact I'd only just whacked off to produce the spunk sample. In the first test the blood was drawn on one day and I returned with the pot of jizz a day later, this time I did both on the same day.

It was 5 bucks for 90 capsules of 500mg each.

Decent dose, but I'm taking 5-10g daily. Should be out soon.

This is my log so far.

Inflammation is definitely down, although I do not have a standard by which to compare it against. Usually my lower back hurts like a mother fucker after leg day, and I barely felt any sensation when pre-loading the workout with 2.5g and taking another 2.5g afterwards. The only time I felt inflammation in the past 3 days was when I didn't take any Astragalus yesterday. So it is possible the anti-inflammatory effects are highly dependent on constant intake (like, one day off shoudn't reset me back to normal, amirite?)

Cognitively speaking, its fucking awesome. I cannot say that at any time have I taken Astragalus and X minutes later I felt better, but over the past few days taking 5-10g daily it appears that the amount of 'spontaneous euphoric bursts of energy' has almost doubled. I do not think this is Astragalus on its own, but I believe it may be enhancing the effects of the L-tyrosine and caffeine I ingest.

So that leads to my most interesting observation, I believe Astragalus can potentiate stimulants and dopamine precursors. This is wholly observation though, as the studies on Astragalus and how it affects neurology are what we call 'non-existent'.

The only downside is that my attention span has decreased slightly, and I am less able to sit down and work for prolonged periods of time without either taking a walk, playing some games, or spontenously dancing. 

No significant effects in physical performance whatsoever, and my diet has not been conducive to judge its effects on fat mass. Both of these topics are unexplored with Astragalus scientifically.

Is there anything else I can try? Kava helps a little, valerian helps a little, L-Theanine helps a little, but none of these work like Phenibut/Benzos.

**Time on the cycle:** 37 days or just over 5 weeks. Planned for 8 weeks, but stopped early after coming down with pukingmygutsupitis.

I did a week and a half of a 5/3/1 cycle without D-AA tog get a baseline of rep maxes. Before starting any of these supplements, I hit the following numbers:

**Squat:** 240x10

**Bench:** 180x11

**Deadlift:** 335x10

**OHP:** 110x10

The most recent rep PRs I hit were:

**Squat:** 280x10 (Was forced to skip my 1+ day due to illness, but I expected 295x8)

**Bench:** 195x10 (with 205x7 being my most recent lift, but it was also effected by me coming down with something)

**Deadlift:** 380x10

**OHP:** 135x7

My bodyweight went from 175lbs to 185lbs, although now I'm back down to 180lbs.

Thoughts: The entire thing cost about $80 and that leaves me with plenty of D-AA, 2/3 of a bottle of Erase and 1/4 of a bottle of tribulus left over for the future. Overall strength gains really start to be noticable around week 2, peak around week 3 and kept steady until week 5 when I started to notice a slight tapering off (homeostasis is a bitch). Overall I'm extremely happy with the gains I saw on this run of D-AA, much more so than when I ran D-AA alone. Unfortunately that came at the cost of violating the WADA Banned List so technically, I'm no longer considered natural. Oh well, someone pass the tren needle. I would usually wait to see what, if any, strength loss occurs after coming off the D-AA, but it would be impossible to differentiate that from loss of strength due to this illness.

Side effects:

**Good:**

* Massive increase in libido (tribulus?)

* Significant increase in testicular size

* Significant increase in body and facial hair growth

**Bad:**

* Hairline receded noticably

* Testicular discomfort/pain during weeks 1 and 2

* Significant increase in acne, both on the face and back.

For example: [Creatine](http://examine.com/supplements/Creatine/#main_clinical_results).

The problem is that it's a bit daunting, and confusing for those that don't know the jargon. For those that don't know (I am going to simplify here), statistical significance just means that the likelyhood of the result (increase, decrease, no change) was likely due to the supplement and not chance. Generally, anything which was less than 5% likely due to chance is considered ""statistically significant""

The problem is that statistically significant only gives you the ability to discern the cause/effect relationship. It does literally zero for how big the actual effect is.

What we really need to do is combine the two to make sense of it.

So we've been slowly but surely adding clinical significance to our database too. This isn't live, and it is definitely subjective to some bias, but all of our data is live and thus open to pointing-out-our-flaws.

So to that end, the question was - what value does the human trials database have? Ideally, it's a bunch of fill in the blanks: _[supplement]_ has a _[strength of effect]_ _[direction of effect]_ on _[attribute]_. For example, **Creatine** has a **strong** effect **increasing** your **power output**.

So would love to solicit your guys' feedback. Here are two quick screenshots:

- [Beta-Alanine](http://i.imgur.com/ODU61Xg.png) ([current](http://examine.com/supplements/Beta-Alanine/#main_clinical_results))
- [Creatine](http://i.imgur.com/mCdklsX.png) ([current](http://examine.com/supplements/Creatine/#main_clinical_results))

Would love for you guys to first take a quick glance and see if it makes sense ...

Okay so - the idea is now we can visually tell you what effect it has (increase/decrease/no effect), the magnitude of the effect (from irrelevant to strong), and the consensus of the research (automatically generated, basically the # of studies that show the same direction of change vs total # of studies). We also have comments, and then the previous ""show studies"" link (which will now be in a modal popup).

- It actives AMPK, which draws in nutrients

- Downstream of AMPK, atrogin-1 is also activated

- Both of these factors work nicely together. AMPK activation occurs when the cell is low on energy (for the purpose of making more ATP from ADP) and inducing atrogin-1 hinders muscle protein synthesis which is seen as a 'needless waste' of ATP, which you are currently low on

- The study noted that stopping AMPK stopped atrogin-1 and also the nutrient uptake (no overall effect) and abolishing atrogin-1 let the nutrients induce muscle protein synthesis

- The atrogin-1 induction was also abolished by mitochondrial support; particularly induction of PGC1a

Attached is just what I found right now; I sort of knew this was the case but I could not prove it until I found the study. Contractions of muscle tissue induces PGC1a and is likely to lessen any adverse skeletal effects of berberine.

Not only does it improve my sleep quality I feel that it has an immediate effect on my mental stability. It makes me feel a lot calmer, and my mind feels in order when doing daily work/activities. I've noticed the code that I write (that's what I do most of the time, write computer programs) while taking it on a regular basis is much cleaner, and easier to comprehend afterwards.  When I don't take it everything is in a mess, and even writing one line of code feels like a huge burden.

For a few month now I have not taken any glycine because I was having difficulty obtaining some. Gradually sleep quality worsened, and after only a day the code that I wrote became harder to write , and confusing. This is when I really noticed it had some sort of significant effect.

I started becoming more anxious, forgetful, impatient, less toler
ant about things, and making hasty decisions about everything (much like how I was before I started taking the supplement) Finally I was able to get some glycine today, and when I took 3000mg I felt  an immediate cure of these symptoms,  how is this even possible? Is it placebo? I stopped being so anxious, and my mind feels noticeably clearer. I haven't even gone to sleep yet, so it doesn't seem to be all related to sleep.

Today is the 2nd to last day that I am going to be taking clomid at full dose (followed by a taper down week at half dose), but because next week is a deload week the results I have as of today is what I'm considering my end results.

Firstly, my dosing looked like so.

W1: 12.5mg clomiphene/day + 3g D-AA/day

W2-6: 25mg clomiphene/day + 3g D-AA/day

W7-9: 25mg clomiphene/day, no D-AA, .5-1mg TB500/week (unrelated)

W10 (next week): 12.5mg clomiphene/day.

**The Results**

* 
**Bench Press:** 255x1 -&gt; 275x1

* 
**Squat:** 335x5 -&gt; 335x3 (my squat remained largely untrained due to a back injury, I squatted maybe 3-4 times during that 10 week period)



* 
**Deadlift:** 465x1 -&gt; 500x1

* 
**Overhead Press** 150x1 -&gt; 170x1

* 
**Bodyweight**: 182lbs on 11/18/12 -&gt; 190.5lbs on 1/21/13

I had a bit of stomach flu 3 weeks ago that dropped my weight back down to about 185, so while I would have liked to have been heavier I'm happy with the weight I gained.

**Side effects:**

* Mood swings - especially early on I had a bit of a temper, or rather just a general ""bitchiness"" about me. This decreased significantly after a month and even more so after I stopped taking D-AA (which was stopped because of the stomach flu and never restarted).

* Depression - There were a lot of inexplicable ""down"" feelings in the last month. Again this effect was lessened after I stopped taking D-AA.

* Inability to listen to music without crying like a bitch - That feel when you're driving to class and getting misty eyed at What It's Like. (Yeah man, I do know what it's like ;_;)

* Testicular discomfort - 100% sure this was the result of the D-AA, again this stopped after I stopped taking D-AA.

* Hair loss - My hairline receded like crazy.

Finally [before](http://i.imgur.com/dbPgA7x.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/TP2Q8Qz.jpg). I didn't have the foresight to take proper before pictures, so I tried to emulate the original picture the best I could. For me the visual side effects are just a bonus that comes with the increase in strength.

For those who give a fuck about this kind of thing, my arms also increased in size from 15.5"" cold to 16"" cold. Woohoo.

**Final Thoughts**

If you can handle the grating mental side effects, this drug is *fan-fucking-tastic*. I plan on stopping use for 5-6 weeks to allow myself to get back to equilibrium (during which time I will be experimenting with GHRP-6 and Mod GRF 1-29.

* Testosterone: 145
 
Starting taking bi-weekly shots.  Felt great, but then read about how it could cause infertility and I'm only 30.  He recommended I go see an endo, so I did...
 
 
The endo tells me before we do anything, get off the testosterone shots for 90 days and then we'll start with a blood test.  Did that and the results of the blood test are as follows
 
* Testosterone: 193
 
* Free Testosterone: 51.1
 
* Sex Hormone Binding Globulin: 13
 
 
We then waiting another 60 days and did another test, all the results the same +/- a very small percentage.  The endo then tells me my free testosterone is in the ""normal range"" and that I don't need any supplements.
 
Normal range for testosterone is 280-1100, I'm 194.
 
Normal range for free testosterone is 47-244, I'm 51.
 
Normal range for sex hormone binding is 13-71, I'm 13.
 
 
 
So as you can see, I'm on the low ""normal"" range of everything, except my testosterone is lower than normal.  I'm not exactly sure what to do at this point.  The endo doesn't want to put me on testosterone, but I honestly felt 100% better when I was on it.  I'm thinking of just buying it online and doing it myself as it is cheaper, but was hoping for any feedback, advice, or suggestions anyone here could provide.

&gt; Theories and Ideas that are not yet validated by scientific literature or are otherwise unsubstantiated in the context of the claim

This doesn't mean that it is inherently good or bad, just that it is kinda useless to us without further context. It could be a phenomenon that is not well known, a phenomenon that *does* occur but has not been intensively studied, or just straight up bullshit. Examples of them include:

**Phenomenon that is not well known**

&gt; Yo brah, I took my L-citrulline pump matrix before bed to get the pump in my pre-sleep push up routine, but it *knocked me the fuck out*. You should use pre-workout supplements to aid in sleep.

In truth, this 'bro' could have also taken his sleep aid or the pre-workout formulation could also have had GABA in it. It is not well known that Nitric Oxide production [increases the permeability of the blood brain barrier to GABA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11849830), meaning that increased NO can turn GABA from an absolute shit sleep aid to a very potent one. This post initially came off as broscience, but with some prodding something new was learned.

**Phenomenon that is not studied by the literature**

&gt; Yo brah, you should Mag-10 pulse 15 minutes prior to a meal in order to induce a higher state of protein anabolism at the onset of the meal and then take a serving of Carbinol-3-Glucoside with it if exceeding 67.333g of carbohydrates

Some things are not studied because there is no grant money for it. It is rare for a study to appear directly looking at a weight-lifting population for the purpose of strength and hypertrophy and, if it does exist, it is usually looking at the efficacy of supplements already 'known' to work such as beta-alanine, creatine, or caffeine.

A lot of research on bodybuilding supplements are extrapolated from studies *in vitro* and studies done in older individuals in order to prevent falls from sarcopenia. 

This does not mean that a claim not founded in the literature is false; it just means it is not yet studied. One can theorize about it, but at the end of the day unless substantial evidence surfaces it is educated circlejerking.

Oh, and sorry Biotest; I love ya guys but I need to take the marketing jab at you for C3G :P

I'll list everything I'm taking, which isn't too many different supps in my opinion, and which ones I believe might be most likely suspects.

Here's the list:
-Taurine 1000mg / 2-3x daily
-Choline and Inositol 500mg / 2-3x
-Korean Red Ginseng Root 400mg / 2-3x
-Bacopa Monnieri Extract 250mg / 2-3x
-Swanson Brand Men's Prime Multivitamin 1x a day

The first thing I suspect is the Bacopa, one reason being that it's effects should take about 4 weeks to become noticeable. That fits into the time period when I first started to feel like crap. The other is the Choline/Inositol since its supposed to have a noticeable effect on mood, just like the Bacopa. So does anyone have any experience with taking any of these and noticing a change, good or bad, on their mood? Or is there some sort of interaction between some of these that could be causing me to feel this way. I know this is a shot in the dark, but I figured this is the right place to post a questions like this. Thanks in advance for any input.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your advice. I'm going to stop the choline as a start and if that doesn't help then probably remove the bacopa and see what happens.

We want to take the bullshit out of the supplement. 

We have **NO** proprietary blend. On our label will be the exact quantities found in each dosage. 

Can people copy our recipe based off this? Yes. You could go ahead and buy bulk and copy what we are doing, but we can provide it to the average person on a mass scale and involving no work for the customer. 

All of our ingredients are supported by scientific research. I am a neuroscientist with a biochemistry background, and I'm partnered with a kinesiologist (not to lend credibility to the chemistry, but he's kind of the spearhead), a biologist, a few business boys, and a nutritionist. This kind of involves some grey area, because something that you believe is supported might not qualify our standards and vice-versa. 

[/r/supplements](/r/supplements), this is where you come in. What would you like to see in a supplement? Any chemicals you guys spit out we will do research on and make sure it lives up to what we believe is scientifically supported. 

If you guys seem to like the idea and are willing to help we can go over the 5 different supplements in a series of posts. If you don't like it, then this is the end of it.  My goal is to hopefully be able to provide this to a group of members of [/r/supplements](/r/supplements) at cost+shipping (for a single container of 1 of the supplements) for your invaluable help and to also see what you guys think. Either this or just provide a few (~5) for free to the top contributors.  But we first need to compile a list of worthwhile and scientifically supported supplements and get the recipe finalized.

Our pre workout consists of:

* creatine
 
* beta alanine

* simple sugars matched with 2:1:1 BCAAs (such as 10g of sugar would be 10g of BCAA)

* citrulline

* caffeine
 
You might find this list short, but these are the only things we think are strongly supported. On the bubble is ALCAR (which we think deserves a place somewhere in the supplement line, but don't know if it should be in the pre, post, sustain...). 

So, what say you?

For a quick introduction to this, Ray Peat's article [here](http://raypeat.com/articles/articles/gelatin.shtml) is a good starting point, though I wish he'd cite better.

Here, he claims that gelatin is missing from our diets due to our preference for essential-amino acid containing muscle tissue over collagen-containing tissue (such as chicken feet, ""head-cheese"" etc), and thus we are deficient in glycine. For reference, amino-acid analysis of gelatin is: glycine 21 %, proline 12 %, hydroxyproline 12 %, glutamic acid 10 %, alanine 9 %, arginine 8%, aspartic acid 6 %, lysine 4 %, serine 4 %, leucine 3 %, valine 2 %, phenylalanine 2 %, threonine 2 %, isoleucine 1 %,hydroxylysine 1 %, methionine and histidine &lt;1% with tyrosine &lt; 0.5 %^[[1]](http://www.gelatin.co.za/gltn1.html) This is clearly an unusually high concentration of non-essential amino acids (proline and glycine) with a complete absence of tryptophan.

Peat argues that when we eat muscle tissue, without gelatin, we take in an amino-acid profile that raises serotonin levels (due to the intake of tryptophan), which is linked with effects of ageing (i.e. immunodepression, inflammation), and that to balance this we should have an intake of glycine-rich foods, such as gelatin.

Why glycine? Research shows that L-glycine is immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective. It also seems effective at protecting the gastric mucosa against stress and chemically-induced ulcers.^[[2]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12589194)[[3]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11212343) There is also some evidence that glycine intake (3g orally) before bed improves both the quality and efficacy of sleep.^[[4]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22293292)[[5]](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jphs/118/2/118_11R04FM/_pdf)

However, we synthesise glycine in our bodies from serine (of which 3PG is the precursor), so why should we be deficient? 

**In order to gain the health benefits of glycine, should we (being those who mostly eat muscle-tissue as a protein source) be supplementing a glycine-rich source such as gelatin?**

   B) have a student discount

   C) when I say im studying biochem they start asking me about the products and what research I have seen.  They also welcome any research I can point out to them so they can educate themselves.


So my question is if any of you had this experience at a GNC, would you still be opposed to it?

Gwern claims two things:

1. Melatonin adds 1 hour to your sleep, i.e. if you slept 7 hours, you will awake feeling rested as if you slept 8 hours.
2.  There are no negative side-effects and it is safe to take melatonin forever.


I have always heard that you shouldn't use melatonin for more than 2 weeks or your body will become dependent and you won't sleep as well without it. 

Can anyone give us the low-down on melatonin, does it hold up to gwern's claims and is it safe to take forever?

The first effect I noticed was on sleep, although ashwagandha is supposed to be a stress reliever and in higher doses apparently a sedative, I noticed the opposite when trying to sleep, my mind would be racing and frantic, you know how you have imaginary conversations in your head before you sleep, well imagine that except 20 people are all talking at once. I've experienced restless leg syndrome before and ashwagandha seemed to induce it, please read up on it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_legs_syndrome) because there's a lot of misconception over restless leg syndrome and it's probably not what you think it is. It actually was not as bad with a larger dose and the effect seemed to wear off after a few days. I remember taking a day or two off ashwagandha, then taking a dose and when going to bed thinking ""yep, it's back"". 

I believe it has had a positive effect on stress during the day but not mood or anxiety. I think back to when I was trying maca and there's a big difference in stress and aggression despite a work load increase. I admit it's hard to say if I'm confirming for me maca's negative effect, or ashwagandha's stress relief potential. I'm less stressed at work that much I know.

I like to read around as many online forums as possible to get a sense of what the general opinion is, ashwagandha more than most supplements has a lot of people reporting zero noticeable effect, which is surprising because there's a fair few studies backing up its stress relieving potential.  It might have a normalizing effect where it blunts stress in a overstimulated environment and conversely winds you up in a restful environment.  It's hard to recommend as a stress reliever, like I said I feel a whole lot less stressed than a few weeks ago on maca, that I'm certain on, but was it ashwagandha's effect? Maybe. It had no effect on mood or anxiety, so as an overall feel-good supplement probably not worth it.

I was taking ashwagandha mainly to see its possible use as a sex supplement, there was no effect on erection quality so I'll just get that out of the way, I also unfortunately noticed no effect on general libido or arousal, however there was an interesting an unexpected effect on sex. I'll be blunt, I had normal sex with my girlfriend, ejaculated everywhere and did our usual clean up, but immediately after I felt like I didn't even have an orgasm, my arousal level was like I was just getting ready for sex ...and I guess I was because we continued to have sex for another 45min or more. In the morning I was wondering why I was still so keen after an orgasm, usually I just want to sleep or go do something else but I'm certainly not interested in additional sex. I thought maybe ashwagandha has an effect on that post-orgasm oh-god-what-have-I-done feeling (cue [the meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oh-god-what-have-i-done--2/photos) NSFW). It's a real thing - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory_period_(sex), *maybe* ashwagandha has an effect on the prolactin response from an orgasm, consider [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11979330) and [this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1949087.stm). I found [one study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ashwagandha%20prolactin) where ashwagandha showed reduced production of prolactin, *fucking fascinating*. If I took a larger dose it didn't increase this effect. I don't think it's a miracle supplement that makes you rebound at 100% every time, but after trying it for a few weeks confident it had a positive effect. I'm usually a one-a-day kind of guy but that went up to probably 2-to-3-a-day when with my girlfriend, but like I said no increase in arousal, just helps to get back in the mood. I started getting blue balls all the time when I increased the dose, this may have had an effect on seminal volume but if it did it was minor, to be honest I just wasn't consistent with measuring. I'm hesitant to say but it *may* have made orgasm harder to achieve, maybe through some other hormonal blunting effects it's having, that's way too much speculation though and I'll judge it against upcoming weeks off the supplement.

TLDR (in my wild speculation)

Good:

- Inhibits or reduces post-orgasm refractory period

- Stress relief

Neutral:

- No negative effects on gastrointestinal tract, nausea, etc.

- No effect on mood or anxiety

- No effect on libido, erection quality, or seminal volume

Bad:

- Sleeplessness

- Restless Leg Syndrome

- Orgasm harder to achieve

This would hypothetically work great with a PDE-5 inhibitor (viagra, horny goat weed), just be mindful of possible effects on rest or sleep. It also probably doesn't work the same on females because they apparently don't have this refractory period. If anyone has similar or contradictory experiences with ashwagandha, please share.

",19,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/nek1e/fluoride_in_a_concentration_of_20_ppm_extensively/,"Peer reviewed study [here](http://static.infowars.com/2011/12/i/general/2011_study-neurodegenerative_changes_from_fluoride_of_brain_spinal_cord_and_sciatic_nerve.pdf)

I am wondering if anyone has any opinions or can critique this study in the context of fluoride supplemention of urban drinking water.

In my opinion, the persons conducting the experiment probably chose (the high) level of 20ppm, in order to demonstrate conclusively the neurological effects, and possibly also to try and observe evidence of other additional effects.

Since the test subjects here are rats, it is not possible to directly extrapolate about potential effects on humans. However my understanding is that often for pathologies like neurotoxicity, an indication of harm for one higher vertebrate, can often be a useful indication for a different class.

In the case of humans, there are many population studies that indicate dosage in the range 4-8 ppm can produce some degree of developmental retardation in children. These adverse neurological effects on children have been widely reported/replicated in Chinese research journals.
 
Given the effects on health that have been shown in population level studies, and also experimentally, is there a reason to be concerned?  If the results from these studies were known at the time that arrangements for supplementation were being considered, would the balance of public health objectives in deciding in favor of supplemention have been different?
  
Note that individual reaction to exposure can be highly variable (I don't think there are any studies that have reported on the standard deviation of effects for an individual). Also many water supplies are dosed higher than 1ppm, so the theraputic index of safety is pretty questionable. My understanding is that it is lower than for drugs such as morphine with its attendant risk of overdose.",,False,,t5_2qhb8,False,,,True,t3_nek1e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/nek1e/fluoride_in_a_concentration_of_20_ppm_extensively/,

Is there anything you do that could be considered 'supplemental' to your health but isn't necessarily something you eat?

Exercise and proper nutrition for example, as a supplement to your health (or rather, the driving force for most people's health). Two of  these I do are light therapy, and dark therapy.

-----------------------------

Some random medical journals regarding light therapy (mostly concerning mood):

I recently bought the second one. Costco also carries them, but they're going to be more expensive for the 10,000LUX varieties (~$100-200)

Some random journals for dark therapy (most of them are regarding bipolar disorder, but there's some evidence for generally improved mood and improved sleep too):

, also a completely free program called 
[f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/)
to use for your computer (make sure to change your time zone though). You won't be able to live without f.lux after you start using it.

------------------------------------------------------

Both light and dark therapy are useful for helping to properly regulate levels of melatonin to desired levels (without having to take it in supplement form, and overdoing it; supplements come in 1mg-10mg but your body only needs about 200mcg a night). 

During the night melatonin levels in the wakefulness center of your brain are supposed to be high (to help make you sleepy) but they are broken down by blue coloured light in the range of ~450nm. The problem is we live in environments filled with light during the night. So f.lux+the glasses help. I usually put them on 3-4 hours before my intended bed time and take them off right before bed, leaving them next to my bed in case I need to get up at night to go pee or something. It's also really important to sleep without any lights on near you (no night lights) or any light creeping in from under the door or anything). This includes stuff like your cellphone, so flip it over so you don't get light in your eyes when you sleep.

During the *day time* though, you actually need this melatonin to be broken down. This used to get done by the sun in the mornings (~10,000-20,000 lux) and it helps prevent you from feeling groggy in the morning and throughout the day. Unfortunately we live indoors now and aren't exactly exposed to a whole lot of natural sunlight throughout the day (also relating to high levels of Vitamin D deficiency in the general population). What I do with my light is I have it set on a timer to turn on about fifteen minutes before my intended wake up time, and it works better than any alarm clock I've ever owned. You can also get lights with built in alarm clocks but they're at least $50 more and a timer only costs ~$5.

----------------------------------------------

**If you're broke/cheap**:

Install flux on your computer, open up your blinds and turn on all the lights in your house first thing in the morning, and try to turn off as many lights as possible during the night. Also don't sleep with a night light, and if you have to get up to pee at night try not to turn on any of the lights or at least throw a t-shirt over your eyes and squint really hard or something.

That, and lets face it, most supplements are either so common that there are already hundreds of reviews for them, or they are just rehashed products that failed before, now with shinier packaging.

Now lets get down to brass tax.

If you are anything like me, at times you get hit with a sweet tooth that strikes at the most inopportune time. Not a ""binge till you puke"" sweet tooth mind you, just the kind when you roam around the house searching through cupboards looking for just a little something sweet to get your fix. Then you find (insert person here)'s stash of leftover Easter candy and it's all over from there. Ten minutes later you contemplate throwing it back up because that completely screws up your macros for the day/week/life.

Insert: Quest Nutrition.

You have probably heard of them one way or another, my first look at their company came from the Reddit Body Transformation Fitness Challenge. One of the prizes for a winner is a box of their protein bars. I did some research into their company and their products and so far, having now tried almost half a dozen boxes of different bars, I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. So, when I ran across their new product called ""Cravings"", I was intrigued. 

*I could have my sweets fix without sacrificing those few oh so precious carbs I am allowed per day on sugar crap?* Quest had my full attention. I immediately ordered a box off their website and almost wished that I could have overnighted it, but I digress. Here is a simplified sample of what you are looking at with the Quest Cravings peanut butter cup vs. Reese's peanut butter cups:

Reese's:
*Calories: 232

*Total Fat: 14g

*Sat Fat: 5g

*Carbs: 25g

*Fiber: 2g

*Sugar:21g

*Protein: 5g

Quest:
*Calories: 232

*Total Fat: 17g

*Sat Fat: 7g

*Carbs: 10g

*Fiber: 3g

*Sugar:1g

*Protein:20g

Take what you want to from that, but if you plan on eating something sweet, this is a much better solution than splurging on the Reese's as you check out at Wal Mart.

Taste: Granted, it's no Reese's. That we have very much established. It's not as creamy, but it also it isn't full of ~~shit~~ less acceptable ingredients either. I have purposefully gone out of my way to stricken sweets from my diet until I got to the point of eating all of my kids candy stash, then ate the Quest PB cups to see if they would do the trick. To my suprise/delight, they did indeed. I now keep some at work, at home, in my gym bag, and when it's cool enough, in my car. (Yes they will still melt everywhere).

All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend these to anyone who is working to maintain their diet/macros, but still would like a little treat now and then without blowing their day's nutritional intake.

We've all heard the story. Such and such guy from such and such store is selling such and such product and he said it would boost my T levels.

Can anyone tell me about such and such product? Yes, such and such product is rubbish and marketing.

^These types of threads are not productive. Any T-booster that does a little something (which is hardly significant) has been posted about a lot (such as DAA).

The fact is true performance enhancers are well known. We know they come in 2 varieties steroids &amp; prohormones (note PH are not well known in the sense of having a long human history, but they are popular in use and have notable effects). Neither of these are supplements, they are drugs.

Steroids are a controlled substance with a long history of human use. Under proper conditions they can be safe (this is why doctors prescribe them). They have strong effects on the body which is why they have strong side effects on the body.

Prohormones are in a legal gray area. They have a poor history of human use. No doctor will prescribe these (human safety is questionable). They have strong effects on the body which is why they have strong side effects on the body.

Anything that isn't a PH/Steroid hasn't been shown to have significant levels on free T.

If you did find something that was OTC &amp; worked it would have side effects similar to a PH/Steroid. I have never seen a product that can have similar effects of a PH/steroid without side effects. The side effects are from your body's natural response. 

Any supplement that boosts T is correcting a deficiency in your diet and is not an actual T booster. These help people who have low test due to a specific deficiency. If I pop extra Zinc every day i'm not going to build significantly more muscle or muscle at all for that matter (i already get enough Zinc from my diet).

Further more even if you find ""the magic supplement"" it will have the same effects of steroids/PH. This will call for PCT which will involve drugs that are most likely controlled. OTC PCT is not adequate for products that significantly boost T.

If you just look at all the drugs/supplements out there you'll realize there is no ""magic supplement"". Anything that works will have side effects. The only stuff that doesn't have side effects simply does work (or does little to nothing).

DAA is the closest legitimate ""test booster"", but you need to understand a few things. If you don't take an AI with DAA then your E goes up and your T hasn't gone up that much. So your T:E ratio isn't too hot. If you take an AI you get side effects for what is such a minor boost... DAA also has very few human studies. If you look at all the DAA logs people are doing their results really aren't crazy. I couldn't tell that most of them were on anything at all...

I received an important question from a fellow Fittit member on how exactly I dose out and keep track of all of my supplements day to day.  Like SH, HG, and many others, I'm big on supplements and I really enjoy the tweaking, fine-tuning, and stochiometry of experimenting with the body, mind, and spirit.  And it's an important question... after all, I take a huge number of supplements in conscious and synergistic accordance with my goals, my nutrition, and my training.  I have to reconcile that with working full-time and then some.

Thus, to answer this user's question, I whipped together a little guide on how you can make supplementation easy in any situation.  I figure sharing the tip may help people out a little bit.  I put together this kit for under $10 and 5 minutes at the Japanese equivalent of a dollar store.  Total cost was 200Y for the six plastic containers, and 200Y for the six scoops as well.  The bag was a purchase freebie.  400Y translates to roughly $5 CAD/USD at the moment.

Many of us are busy folks, whether we're often parenting, at school, at work, or on business trips / vacations.

I just like experimenting.** I'm putting this in /r/supplements, because I strongly believe albuterol doesn't belong in /r/steroids

Why did I do it?  
At the end of February, I decided to cut, but it went really horribly, I didn't have enough time for excercise and I ate too little, so my lifts dropped **a lot**. In one month:  
BP: 57.5kg -&gt; 50kg  
OHP: 37.5kg -&gt; 32.5kg  
Squat: 90kg -&gt; 72.5kg  
DL: 120kg -&gt; 100kg  
(all 3x5).  

I noticed this and started eating like before, IF 2800kcal/2200kcal, 2g protein per 1kg mass, but my recovery was going painfully slow. I started researching albuterol and it seemed like a wonder drug - no sides, great efficiency. It's so safe, doctors prescribe it to kids in syrup form (4-8mg daily). I ordered some and started eating it.  

Day1: 12mg (mistake, should have started lower to avoid sides)  
Sides: Shaky hands, slight sweating, some coughing - I think it widened my bronchi and I started to cough up all the mucus build up.  
Day2: 12mg  
Sides: Shaky hands, sweating, no coughing.  
Day3-5: 12mg  
Sides: none  
Day6-10: 16mg  
Sides: none  
Day11: 20mg  
Sides: none  
Day12: 16mg  
Sides: none  
Day13: 12mg  (today)
Sides: none  
Day14: 8mg (tomorrow)  
Sides: we'll see. I don't expect anything  

I plan to pop 4mg on day 15 and 16, then stop. I've been using ketotifen since day7, 1mg before bed. No idea if it made a difference, but just to be sure. Plan to use it few days after I stop taking albuterol.

Now this has been interesting: My weight went from 74kg@19%bf to 68kg@14%bf in **7 days**. bf% measured on electronic personal scale, so it's not very precise, but it's mean from morning/noon/evening measurement. I don't know how much I weight today, but my lovehandles almost disappeared. I have fucked up fat distribution for some reason, everything goes to my lower stomach. I see my top abs even at 20% bf.

But the most interesting thing is - I regained my strength and **more**.  My stats as today:

BP: 65kg  
OHP: 35kg (still sucks, but less)  
Squat: 92.5kg  
DL: 125kg  
(3x5)

Not bad for 2 weeks, is it?  

My training was modified Greyskull LP. No cardio, sorry.  

A: BP 3x5, Curl 2x10, decline BP 3x8, chins 3x4 (+negatives), squat 3x5, calf raise 3x20  
B: OHP 3x5, DB BP 3x8, narrow grip BP (triceps press?) 3x8, machine chins 3x8, yates rows 3x5, DL (100kg) 1x5 no belt, DL 1x5 belt, shrugs 3x12
AxBxAxB...  
All 3x5 excercises are greyskull style = last set is ""as many reps as possible""  


**Was it woth it?**  HELL YES!  

I don't want to persuade anyone to take prescription only substances, this is just my personal experience and your mileage may and WILL vary.  

Any questions?

EDIT:  
I forgot to list my supplements:  
5g creatine, 5g taurine, 750mg magnesium lactate, vit D 5k IU  
10grams of BCAA 4:1:1 before fasted training

If extra arginine does = NO boost, then just an arginine booster and possibly arginase inhibitor would be sufficient right? Or could this be bad in the long run and cause [argininemia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argininemia)?

**THE GOOD**:

I noticed a definite boost in libido, not immediately but after a few days it set it, most notably sexual thoughts and spontaneous erections (I once had to get off the train holding my laptop case over my crotch to hide my shame), trivial things would set me off, I was entertaining sexual ideas that I'd lost interest in long ago, I viewed more porn because I wanted some kind of stimulation more often.

My girlfriend tells me my semen has a consistent bitter taste, about a week into the maca she tells me that I taste a lot better, she didn't know I was taking it, just something she noticed on her own.

I also wake up in the middle of every night to go to the toilet, this completely stopped when taking maca, I have no idea why, maybe it has some voodoo effect on the urinary tract.

**THE NEUTRAL:**

There was no effect on erection quality, no effects of nausea or stomach upset or any other side effects, and it also smells nice.

**THE BAD:**

This is hard to explain and I don't know how much weight you'll hold in my anecdote but I'm just going to report what I experienced. Maca is touted as an anxiolytic and stress reliever but I experienced the opposite at times. I noticed increased stress, anxiety, feelings of jealousy, the best way I can describe it is I felt emotionally fragile, that might sound fruity but it's what I felt. In stressful environments I had emotional surges where I felt like I was holding back a 5yr old's tantrum, other times when there was no real stressors around I just felt sad for no reason (*not depressed*) and lonely at times (fwiw I'm not a loner, I have friends, hobbies, a girlfriend, etc.), I was also sweating a more just throughout the day so there's a physical response to support my anecdote, maybe these emotions tie into the increase in libido some how, I don't know. The further into the trial and with a higher dose I felt increased aggression, this wasn't always a bad thing.

It could just be that I had a particular stressful time at work or something else, but this all just felt out of character for me. I was all ready to make a bulk order of maca after experiencing the effects on arousal but now I'm hesitant to even recommend it since I feel it could have more effects on your emotional spectrum than just libido.

If you were going to try it, I'd suggest having a large dose over a few days for a ""dirty weekend"" or something, possibly combined with something to calm you down (ashwagandha, panax ginseng, alcohol?), then put it away rather than take it continuously.

Then there's seminal volume, the only thing that gets more random testaments on seminal volume is maybe arginine, and unlike arginine, maca actually has some studies to back it up, so I was hopeful for some results. It didn't increase volume ([chart here](http://i.imgur.com/kX8Dj.png)), in fact it trended downward. You can't draw concrete conclusions from a two week study on one guy, but if anyone tries to tell me maca will make you ""cum buckets"" my response now is they're full of shit.

In the end it's cheap and I definitely recommend you at least try it if you're in the market for a sex supplement, just be mindful of mood swings.

BEFORE DRINKING

* L-Cysteine - counteracts effects of [acetaldehyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine#Reducing_toxic_effects_of_alcohol)
* Vitamin B6 (high dose - 400mg) - depleted by alcohol. [Can reduce symptoms by 50%](http://www.annals.org/content/132/11/897.full).
* Vitamin C (high dose - 1500mg)
* Milk Thistle - [improves liver function](http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/milk-thistle-000266.htm)
* Water - rehydrates against alcohol's diuretic effects. I find drinking 2-litres during the day before drinking makes a big difference.


BEFORE SLEEP

* Water
* Vitamin B6 (high dose - 400mg)
* Powerade/Gatorade - restores electrolyte and B vitamins (but less intense than Pedialyte/Dioralyte), raises blood sugar
* Ibuprofin - stops brain swelling?

NEXT DAY

* Water
* Vitamin C (high dose - 1500mg)
* Pedialyte/Dioralyte - [restores electrolytes and fluids](http://hangoverschool.com/pedialyte-hangover-cure/) or Powerade/Gatorade
* Alka Seltzer Morning Relief
* General movement/exercise

For a double blind trial though, one needs placebos.  For supplements, the easiest pacebo would be another supplement that looks, smells, and tastes identical to the test one.  I realize that comparing two supplements is a confounder (e.g. caffeine vs a ""control"" of ephedra for example), but we can work though that.

As such, if you look through your supplement collection, do you have any supplements that appear identical but are different (e.g. not brand 1 vs brand 2 of fish oil).  Ideally these supplements would be available to a large audience, say by a big manufacturer and/or available online.

I could really use some advice from someone more experienced than me.

I workout 3-4 times a week and prior to two weeks ago, I supplemented only with creatine, fish oil, green tea extract and CLA.

I bought a tub of MP Assault as I thought it was considered one of the more gentle PWOs on the market. I've only been doing half a scoop to keep it light.

Fast forward to Wednesday. I get off work, take my Assault (1/2 scoop) and 2 BCAA caps and head to the gym. On my way there I felt a serious tightness in my chest, as if my heart was struggling almost. Get there, walk into the locker room, drop my gym bag and I realize that my right arm, up to the elbow and especially the fingers is very numb. I get a little panicky and in my idiot state, google ""symptoms of a heart attack"". Of course tightness in chest and numbness in extremities is there so I decide to drive myself to the emergency room.

At this point I may be having a panic attack. My arm feels numb above the elbow and I think my right leg (same side) is starting to feel numb as well. I get to the emergency room and get checked in.

Here are the results:

*148/96 BP

*350 CKP

*All else normal.

*Normal blood floow on EKG.

*Normal pulse.

*No reduction of motor control, just lack of sensation.

I get released and go home. The doctor doesn't think I had a heart attack but apparently can't be 100% sure. She thinks I had too much stuff in my system without enough water to balance it.

I personally tend to agree because I had drank somewhat heavily the night before so my body was dehydrated. I did the math on some of the things I took.

*3 caplets of Excedrin for morning hang over - 195mg

*1 16oz cupf of dark coffee - 160-180mg.

*1/2 scoop of MP Assault - 150mg.


That brings me to about 525mg for about a 9 hour period. It's high and it could explain the chest tightnes, but it does not explain why other symptoms were isolated to only one side of my body. I want to think that the numbness and BP was due to me panicking and my doctor agrees that what happened to me was most likely not cardiovascular in nature, but I'm curious if there is something I might be missing.

I don't know if its related but I am taking 10mg of Lexapro, an SSRI. Stims are only supposed to have negative interactions with MOAIs but I suppose the extra detail can't hurt.

So this obnoxious plethora to choose from raises a few questions for me:

*Which is best for my goals: Whey, Soy, or Milk protein?

*What exactly is isolate? How does it affect my decision?

*Are there any more frugal options that will still optimize
the same efficiency as the leading brand powder?

I'm sure a lot of my questions are downright obvious, and I can probably answer them myself, but I just want to make sure I'm not wasting my money. When I buy the powder, I just want to know my knock off brand is as effective as the one they sell at GNC. If that analogy even makes sense..

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the suggestions and clarifications! I'll definately be looking into all the names and brands given to me below. If anyone cares to check back, I'll update with the product I actually choose. 2/27

**EDIT:** So i went with this 100% Oat and Whey supplement by ON. This decision seemed the best for many reasons:

5mg Vitamin B6, 1.7g Leucine, 1.2g Glutamine, 0.8g Isoleucine, 0.8g Valine, 2.5g Citrulline, 1.4g ALCAR, 20mg DMAA (I wouldn't use it), 0.2-0.4g Caffeine, 1.4g Choline Citrate (~0.5g Choline), 2.7g Creatine(can double), 55mg Theanine, 1.4g Tyrosine(can half), 1.4g Beta-Alanine(can double), 1.1g Inositol(can half).*

I am just looking for a little input from people who have tried this preworkout stack that was posted last year. 

With the new research and such that is available, new products and trial and error, what would you change about this stack? You guys are much more knowledgeable than I am and I would like to hear what you have changed/tried, any input is appreciated.

Side question, shipping this stuff to Canada would be about 50$, is there a better site for that?
All credit goes to herman_gill, I did message you but figured more people could benefit/share their ideas through here.

Thanks

-cardio improved

-libido went way down. this was surprising as DAA increased it. 

-testicle size (in case silverhydra is interested) and seminal volume went down also

I train for Powerlifting 3-4 days a week, bike 4-5miles/day 5 days a week (commute), and am trying to cut weight. 

On average I get 5-6 hours of sleep per night. Some of those nights might get broken up for me to look into an issue.

In the last 3 weeks, I have worked straight through the night twice (awake for 36+ hours) and while this is not common, it does happen.

Currently, I am trying to keep my diet reasonably low carb, although the last 2 weeks has been awful. In general, my diet is:

Diet: (Total Calories is usually around 2200, /w ~100g carbs (less most days) Protein 200+g the remainder being fats)

**Breakfast**: None.

**Lunch:** Meat (chicken, broccoli, steak, fish, something) + Veg (Broccoli and green beans are common, but other greens as well)

**Dinner**: Basically the same as lunch. Lunch is usually just left over dinner.

**Random Snacks** - law carb tortillas /w peanutbutter or cheese or something. Pepperoni because it is fucking delicious, random meats, low carb ice cream once in a while.

**Supplements:**

* No-Xplode or something similar pre-workout
* Whey (whatever amount is needed to hit my 200g/protein a day goal - some days this means none)
* Fishoil 6g/day
* Choline - 1g/day (I think, I need to check the scoop size, pretty sure it is 1g)
* ZMA - [This](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/now/zma.html)
* Inositol - Just started taking this as it was recommended due to the lack of fruit in my diet. 
* Caffeine - Varies, but usually around 300-600mg/day. Some days less, some more.
* Creatine - 5g/day
* Vitamin D - 4000iu (forgot this originally please don't kill me herman.)



I find that with lack of sleep, I eat more, and it is usually absolute trash as most times if I am up at 3am working, it is unplanned, so I get stuck with fast food, which can be ok, but I usually end up feeling like shit for it. I've started keep emergency food in the freezer at work (some fish and broccoli) to prevent this.


So, with that in mind, what type of supplements can be take to supplement lack of sleep?

""I take about 250 pills of nutritionals a day"".

""For boosting antioxidant levels and for general health, I take a comprehensive vitamin-and-mineral combination, alpha lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, grapeseed extract, resveratrol, bilberry extract, lycopene, silymarine (milk thistle), conjugated linoleic acid, lecithin, evening primerose oil (omega-6 essential fatty acids), n-acetyl-cystein, ginger, garlic, l-carnitine, pyrodoxal-5-phosphate, and echinacea. I also take Chinese herbs prescribed by Dr. Glenn Rothfeld. 

For reducing insulin resistance and overcoming my type 2 diabetes, I take chromium, metformine (a powerful anti-aging medication that decreases insulin resistence and which we recommend everyone over 50 consider taking) and gymnema sylvestra. 

To improve LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, I take policosanol, gugulipid, plant sterols, niacin, oat bran, grapefruit powder, psyllium, lecithine and lipitor. To improve blood vessel health I take arginine, TMG and choline. To decrease blood viscosity I take daily baby aspirin and lumbrokinase. I reduce inflammination by taking EPA/DHA and curcumin. I have dramatically reduced my homocystein level by taking folic acid, B6 and TMG. 

I have a B12 shot once a week and take a daily B12 sublingual. Several of my intravenous therapies improve my body's detoxification: weekly EDTA and monthly DMPS. I also take n-acetyl-carnitine orally. I take weekly intravenous vitamins and alpha lipoic acid to boost antioxidants. I do a weekly glutathione IV to boost liver health. 

Perhaps the most important intravenous therapy I do is a weekly phosphatidylcholine IV, wich rejuvenates all of the body's tissues by restoring youthful cell membranes. I also take PtC orally each day and supplement my hormone levels with DHEA and testosterone. I take I-3-C, chrysin, nettle, ginger and herbs to reduce the conversation of testosterone into estrogen. I take a saw palmetto complex for prostate health. For stress management I take l-theonine, beta-sitosterol, phosphatidylserine and green tea in addition to drinking 8 to 10 cups of green tea itself. 

At bedtime I take GABA and sublingual melatonin. For brain health I take acetyl-l-carnitine, vinprocetine, phosphatidylserine, ginkgo biloba, glycerylphosphatidylcholine, nextrutine and quercertin. For eye health I take lutein and bilberry extract. For skin health I use an antioxidant skin cream on my face, neck and hands every day. For digestive health I take betaine HCl, pepsin, gentian root, peppermint, acidophilus bifodobacter, fructooligosaccharides, fish proteins, l-glutamine and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine.

As much as I research and branch out, Cyanidin-3-Glucoside (the newest compound from Biotest) still remains the best compound in this general field. Why this frustrates me is:

- Biotest has a current monopoly on the liposomal delivery system (needed) for high dose Cyanidin-3-Glucoside (high dose needed)

- Its mother fucking $480 for 6 weeks

I'm looking into a way to mimic the delivery system (with help of redditor pwoolf) so potentially we can use non-liposomal delivery agents of Cyanidin-3-Glucoside for cheaper. However, I don't know if those exist.

[Week 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/vnv2f/exlaxbros_getsupps_daa_log_week_2/)

As for Week 3, I'm still trying to shake off/work around what I think is some elbow tendinitis, so that's messing me up a bit. It hits most with heavy low bar squats and then the aching continues through the rest of the week. The plan is to take 3-4 weeks off of heavy upper body and do some leg focus, so I'll be running the leg specialization from Lift-Run-Bang. This puts me doing heavy leg work highbar 3 days a week and I'll fill in the other 2 days a week with light upper body, working back to pressing and stuff as my elbow allows.

As far as the DAA goes, I don't have much of a noticeable effect. Libido is roughly the same as before and lifting, while it is hard to tell because of the elbows, feels basically the same. This kind of falls in line with my hypothesis that it won't have as profound an effect when your T levels are already high-normal. I'll see what the difference feels like after I cycle off of it though, maybe then I'll notice the difference.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/raxzc/this_week_on_human_guinea_pig_ostarine/

Today marks the final day of week 6, and I'll be starting a PCT of Nolvadex as of tomorrow. For those of you interested in my progress over the six weeks, here it is:

**DEXA scan on 9th March:**

Weight: 84.992kg

LBM: 73.627kg

BF%: 13.4%

**Commenced Ostarine at 12.5mg ED March 29th.**

Scale weight: 83.4kg

Squat 1RM (ATG): 105kgs (231lbs)

Bench 1RM: 77.5kgs (171lbs)

Deadlift 1RM: 150kgs (331lbs)

Press 1RM: 60kgs (135lbs)

**Diet:**

 Wasn't calorie-controlled, ate LG-style. Lots of Krispy Kremes, lots of pizzas, lots of fun. Maintenance is approx. 3000kcal, by the end of it had at *least* a 1000cal/day surplus.

**Exercise Routine:**

Exercise Selection: Primarily the Big 4, however included ancillary exercises such as DB row, chins, etc. in the first 3 weeks.

Programming: 3 lifts a day, eventually moving down to 2 lifts a day by the end (removed anxcillaries).

Rep Scheme: Started by pyramiding up to heavy triples, then down. Moved to heavy doubles, then singles. Eventually would do 4-8 max singles after a brief warm-up, then sub-max singles or max doubles/triples for 2-5 sets.

Frequency: Initially 4 times a week, then 5, then 6.
    
**Progress:**

Scale Weight: 89kgs (Graph charting weight progression found here: http://imgur.com/UKGsR)

Squat 1RM (ATG): 127.5kgs (281lbs)

Bench 1RM: 85kgs (187lbs)

Deadlift 1RM: 175kgs (386lbs)

Press 1RM: 67.5kgs (149lbs)

*Will update this section with DEXA Scan results at my next appointment, on June 9th.*

**Photos:**

Gratuitous nudity forthcoming, shots with &amp; without flash.

After (10th May): http://imgur.com/18fj8, http://imgur.com/8FbNa

Photos don't really show much to my eyes, unfortunately.

**Thoughts:**

 Yeah, ostarine is good. I felt no real ill-effects from the training frequency, which given it's the first time I've tried something like this is notable. Gains started out strong, then started to taper off at the end as the graph kinda shows. This means ostarine may be more suited to 4-week cycling. I also don't feel I gained a significant amount of fat, but I'll wait for the DEXA to know for sure.

 Strength gains were beyond anything else I've ever experienced (noob gains notwithstanding). Again that's likely in part due to the programming, but I'm guessing ostarine played a significant part.

**Would I recommend it?**

 Sure, why not? I didn't notice any sides, and I made gains. If you're not particularly opposed to the idea of SARMs, it's worth a shot.

Need help!",15,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1bcmus/sedentary_normalweight_friend_has_got_the_idea_to/,"Hi!

**TL:DR**

A normal weight friend wants to use Stackers for weigtloss as a quick fix without working out/controlling diet. Will this work? Is this dangerous and/or a waste of time/money?

**I would like some help on this matter.**

One of my closest friends has asked me for advice about “Stackers”. He wants to use them for weightloss. I would say that he is normal weight, maybe skinny fat. More or less totally sedentary and shies away from exercise and wants a quick fix.

He will NOT use them as part of a workout plan while taking control of his diet :) (he won’t listen to reason, I could help him with tha basics if he did, *so that is not the question here*).

I know very little about supplements in general and Stackers and similar in particular. I only think I know the basic concept that they contain a number of “uppers” as ephedrine and caffeine and such and stimulates the central nerve system for increased metabolism and energy levels?

These are my questions/concerns:

* Will this have any relevant effect on his goals or is it a waste without exercise/diet?
* How dangerous is it? Common side effects? One-in-a-million bad luck stuff?
* Will it affect mood? Risks for depression or similar (my friend has a history…)?
* Regardless of the above, what products are recommended and have good effect?
* Trusted supplier (live in Sweden)?
* Legal status (live in Sweden, buying from USA/UK/Sweden?)
* What is the correct use of such products? Get those last percent of deff when you already are pushing workout/diet to max (aka bodybuilding like competition prep?)
* Aren't they more of a pre-workout thing?

I think that is all.

I’m worried about my friend’s health, wallet and attitude on the matter of “fitness”. Any and all help and input would be much appreciated!

They explained there were doing nothing but:

* AM vitamins: fish oil, multi
* AM &amp; Breakfast - 1 scoop Muscle Pharm combat power with water
* Pre-Workout - 1 scoop Muscle Pharm assault
* Post Workout - Animal Pak Nitro
* 1 hour post workout - 1 scoop Muscle Pharm combat with almond milk

They also did a protein shake ""whenever they were hungry"".  Looking over some insight from anyone here who may know about this.  I'm usually fairly skeptical here... but now I'm honestly thinking about trying it.

Edit -- I did a little research here and with 6 shakes a day it would still only be about 1000 calories.   I think combined with eating a healthy lunch could put me into the 1600 - 1700 per day range.  Combing with 1.2g of protein per pound this might be doable.

First of all, what I'm taking:

* Clomiphene citrate - 12.5mg/day for the first week, 25mg/day after that.

* D-AA - 3g/day

* Vitamin D - 5000 IU/day

* Vitamin K - .5mg/day

* Zinc gluconate - 30mg/day

* Magnesium citrate - 500mg/day

* ALCAR - 1.5g/day

* Creatine - 5-10g/day

* Fish oil - a lot/day

**Bodyweight:**

**182lbs** on 11/18/12 (the day before starting clomid) to **190.5lbs** today (12/16/12)

Bench Press:

My working sets on 11/18/12 (testing my strength to get a baseline):

&gt;225x1 Paused

&gt;235x1 Paused (PR)

&gt;245x1

&gt;255x1

&gt;215x5

&gt;215x5

&gt;215x4

&gt;200 3x3 paused

&gt;200 2x3 paused close grip

My working sets today (12/16/12):

&gt;225x6

&gt;225x6

&gt;225x6

&gt;225x6

&gt;225x5

&gt;185x9x3, long pauses, varying grips

Tl;dr: **Just about 215 3x5 to just about 225 5x6.**

I also did 215 3x7 last session if you prefer that as a comparison.

**Overhead Press:**

145x3 on 11/16/12 to 155x2 on 12/15/12

Not much improvement here on paper, but considering the uphill battle that is my overhead press, I'm extremely happy with it.

For a more standardized comparison, I went from 135x5 to 135x9.

Unfortunately I can't give you any information on squats and deads as I've been barred from doing them for three months entirely, and heavily indefinitely.

**Noteworthy side effects:**

* General moodiness/a feeling of being ""down""

* Body hair growth

* Moderate head hair loss

Bloodwork will come as soon as I can justify spending the cash to get it done. Progress pictures will be included in the final post.

Also, for the sake of honest comparison, my pre clomid bench work set progress looked like so:

9/17: 200x8 and 9/23: 225x3 (pick which you would rather use as a metric)

10/21: 205x5x5

11/18 (Day before clomid started): 215x2x5, 215x4

12/16: 225x4x6, 215x5

So there it is, concrete proof that I made faster progress on Clomid/D-AA than when not on Clomid/D-AA.

Recently I discovered that her certification is BioSignature, which is a course that is run by Poliquin himself. Fair enough I thought, and I found the price to be (after shipping) comparable to other BCAA products. But what I also discovered was a ratio that was unlike any other product.

Typically BCAAs are 2:1:1 Leucine Isoleucine Valine but I found the one I'm taking to be 4:1:1 Leucine Isoleucine Valine + .85  Lysine HCl

I understand Leucine to be the primary ingredient for muscle growth in BCAA products, but is 4:1:1 + Lysine a good formula?

So questions: What are you guy's recommended doses for these powders, aka how many mg before working out?

Is caffeine anhydrous the same as normal caffeine?

And I am looking for a pre-workout that can provide me with the staples of muscle building, as in substances that increase/ help increase strength, but also a drink to make me ""jacked"" for the workout and increase energy. Does anyone have any recommendations or switches to my setup that would better reach these goals?

I'll start (although the stack is likely to change a little bit really soon:

---------------------------------------------------------------

Pill 1 (split into 4 doses):

* 2g arginine, 1g lysine, 1g creatine (going to 2g Creatine, and swapping 1g of Arginine for 1g Citrulline)

Pill 2: (split into 4 doses):

* 1g Beta-Alanine, 1g ALCAR, 2g Taurine (going upto 2g ALCAR, 2g Beta-Alanine)

Pill 3 is the multivitamin (split into 4 doses):

* 250mg alpha lipoic acid, 250mg coenzyme q10, 125mg grape seed extract, 100mg lactase, 

* 100ug Chromium, 1.25mg Copper, 1.25mg Iron, 300ug Iodine, 20mg Zinc, 250mg Magnesium (and I guess 500mg Chloride, and 1g Citric acid), 300ug Selenium

* 25mg Theanine, 125mg Pramiracetam, 750mg Choline (from 1.5g alpha-gpc), 500mg Inositol, 

* 500ug Biotin, 50ug B12, 25mg B-Complex (about 2.5mg-5mg of each), 500ug Folate, 1mg Fucoxanthin, 125ug Vitamin D3 (5000IU), 500ug Vitamin K1, 2mg Vitamin K2 MK4, 25mg Vitamin E Tocotrienols. (won't be a lot of major changes: take out lactase, go to 125mg theanine, 2g Alpha GPC, 1g Inositol, will require one more pill)

Pill 4 (for fasting, taken all at once in the morning) is: 

* 2g BCAAs, 4g Glutamine, 2g Leucine

Pill 5 (for mah diabetes, split into 3 doses) is: 

* 500mg black pepper, 500mg turmeric, 1g cinnamon, 1g fenugreek (switching to 5 pills daily: 1g black pepper, 1g turmeric, 2g cinnamon, 1g fenugreek)

**TL;DR:** I made a multivitamin and take 15 pills daily on non-fasting days and 23 on fasting days. This will change to 21 pills daily and 29 pills on fasted days.

In February this year I was made redundant at my place of employment. They gave me a solid payout so between that and now the money I'm receiving from the Government for studying full-time, I should be able to stretch it out for quite a while.

That said, I'm spending more than I'd like to and am trying to tighten the belt wherever I can.

Sorry in advance for the wall of text.    

I'm curious about Berberine and figure it can't hurt, and I want to experiment with my own sleep stack. 
  

I am female, 36, overweight, but otherwise in good health.  My current goals are fat loss while retaining as much muscle as I can and getting consistent good sleep.  I have a lot of trouble sleeping, have tried a whole bunch of things (even RXs, which I'd like to avoid. )  Nothing works very well, so I want to try mixing some things in higher doses.

So what I currently take could be all of the following, but I'm not always the most consistent.

First thing:  Fexofenadine 180mg (Shitty allergies)

Pre-workout:  EC(24/200mg) with Beta-Alanine(1g), Creatine(3g), Choline(1g), Cissus(1g), L-Carnitine(500mg).  (Sometimes I'm lazy and just use Whiteflood.)  I avoid stimulants after 2PM due to the sleep issues, but they happen even if I am cycling off the EC and avoid the other stuff.

At some point with a meal: Fish oil, Vit D(2000-5000mg depending on my sun exposure), CoQ10(100mg), maybe a multi

Night:  I had been taking Schiff Melatonin Ultra which contains the following: 3mg Melatonin + 25mg L-Theanine + 25mg GABA + Chamomile &amp; Valerian Extracts, along with ZMA, 5-HTP(100mg), and usually about 50mg of diphenhydramine.  Shitty allergies, again.  I can take that dose any time with no drowsy effects, though.

So my question is, since that “sleep stack” hasn't been doing the job, I wanted to play with quantities of those things and have purchased them all individually.  I've looked into to recommended doses for each, but don't want to do something stupid by stacking them.  Are there compounding effects with these things which is why they were in such small quantities in the Schiff product?  (I know about the less is more idea with melatonin.  It doesn't seem to be the case with me and I may just be a non-responder.)

Is there anything in this list of things that is a bad idea to mix and is throwing the Berberine in there going to mess with anything?  

I'm still new, but try to read up.  I'm also interesting in adding in Piracetem and/or Noopept and am still researching that.

And sorry if this is rambling.  I've had about 4 hours of sleep in the last 60 hours.

Throughout the day my diet is basically: Egg whites, bacon, and cheese for breakfast.  Handful of almonds or carrots &amp; ranch as a mid morning snack.  Chicken &amp; veggies for lunch.  Mozz sticks wrapped in ham/turkey for mid-afternoon snack.  Then when I get home I have a few oz of beef jerky as a pre-workout meal.  Low-carb, obviously.

I currently work 8:00AM-5:00PM and get to the gym around 7:00PM.  My workout lasts about an hour so I am home at 8:00-8:30pm.  When I get home around 8:45pm, I have a scoop of whey (24g), creatine (5g), and glutamine (5g) with milk (14-15oz).  

Around 9:30pm I have a post-workout meal since I am filled up from the protein shake.. I usually some kind of lean beef or chicken with veggies.  

I normally start to fall asleep around 11:00-11:30PM and I'm still pretty full from the shake and post-workout meal.

My question is: for a day like mine, should I be having casein at night before I go to bed?  Should I simply replace the whey with casein?

I guess it depends on my goals? Right now, the main goal is to reduce fat and gain muscle.

(x-post from r/nootropics),11,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/16q0zk/supplements_methods_of_increasing_dopamine/,"Sorry this is so long. I just want to get all possibly relevant information out there. Thanks for any input you have, guys.

I was wondering if anyone here has advice on this.

I cycle caffeine (200mg) + L-Theanine (400mg), then American Ginseng (480mg) + Lemon Balm (800mg). Daily, I take Fish Oil 4 times (to ensure i'm getting &gt;1g of omega-3s), Vitamin D3 2000IU, and Choline bitartrate (600mg).

I've got to say, the caffeine and l-theanine combination have been a significant help for my ADHD. Not something I can take every day though - tolerance is a bitch. Once in a while, L-Theanine does nothing for my ADHD. I'm in a pickle.

I've never been officially prescribed things like Adderall, but have tried it on a few occassions with great success. However, being amphetamine-based, I of course have concerns for my long-term health (as well as short term). I've also been on Strattera (worked somewhat well, but by the time I worked up to 80mg my stomach was in intense pain daily, so I stopped).

I'm improving my diet, moving out the junk and in with the nutritious. I've cut fast food, &gt;90% of sugar, and severely limit my grain intake. Soon, I will cut grains entirely, using Quinoa instead. I also exercise 5 days a week with a Bowflex machine (following a workout schedule), and on the other 2 days I ride an exercise bike.

ADHD is still rampant in my life, and I understand that a physiological symptom of ADHD is a low density of dopamine receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Are there any kinds of supplements / activities that could possibly increase density? I've considered Wellbutrin, but the idea of a dopamine antagonist unnerves me slightly.

I've taken neurotransmitter precursors like L-Tyrosine rather sparingly, because from my basic understanding of neurology (correct me if I'm wrong), the constant floods of dopamine will cause receptor downregulation.

TLDR; exercising and eating well, looking to somehow increase dopamine receptor density as a treatment for ADHD, or elsewise increase basal dopamine levels.",,False,,t5_2qhb8,False,,,True,t3_16q0zk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/16q0zk/supplements_methods_of_increasing_dopamine/,

I am currently looking for supplements and/or herbs which can induce hunger and appetite (as opposed to suppressing it, in the case of weight loss).

I have generalized anxiety disorder (plus panic disorder plus purely-obsessional OCD [[yup, it's a thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_Obsessional_OCD)]) which frequently plays havoc with my desire to eat. Specifically, it's anxiety-induced nausea that is occasionally so strong that the thought of food sickens me and eventually leads to frequent skipped meals. This is not a case of [body dysmorphic disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder), but simply ""too much anxiety, too much nausea, don't want to eat."" Generally, the feeling goes away when the anxiety eventually goes down and my stomach starts to growl.

One thing that helps a bit is ginger, but eating it all the time gets a bit irritating.

I eventually plan on getting back into my workout routine, but I was looking for suggestions of supplements that could help kickstart my appetite and hunger when it is lacking.

From Wikipedia

It seems that Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is the second messenger for the LH secretion (see excerpt below) I just don't know if it is ""rate limiting"". If it is... could PDE5 inhibitors prolong the anabolic effects of a D-AA supplement... much the way that MAOI's prolong the effects of things like Caffeine?

&gt;&gt;In humans and rats, sodium D-aspartate induces an enhancement of LH and testosterone release. In the rat pituitary, sodium D-aspartate increases the release and synthesis of LH through the involvement of cGMP as a second messenger, whereas in rat testis Leydig cells, it increases the synthesis and release of testosterone and cAMP is implicated as second messenger. In the pituitary and in testes D-Asp is synthesized by a D-aspartate racemase which convert L-Asp into D-Asp.

[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774316/)


I could see this being usefull by making individuals that strive to derive anabolic effects from D-AA have higher levels of LH in their bloodstream for longer periods of time... or is LH more specifically for sex drive and thus prolonging cAMP would be a better way to prolong elevated T levels???

**TRAINING**

I'm on the Strongman/Powerlifting team at my university, currently training for a powerlifting competition at the latest in mid-November, but I may find one before then. We recently finished our Strongman ""season"" with a competition at the end of May, in which I placed 4th out of 10 lightweights (&lt;190#). My 1RM's are currently 265/385/455# at 170#. My goal is to go 300/400/500 at the competition in November at a lean 175-180. My program is designed with influence from Jamie Lewis and Layne Norton to achieve gains in maximal strength and hypertrophy and looks like this:

MON: Heavy Upper

* 15 sets of 1, 12x2, or 10x3-5: compound push and pull

TUE: Heavy Lower

* 15x1, 12x2, or 10x3-5: compound lower (back/front squat or occasional deadlift)

WED: Heavy Upper

* 15x1, 12x2, or 10x3-5: compound push and pull

THUR: Hypertrophy Lower

* 6-8x1-3: Speed Squat or Full Clean

* 3-5 x 6-8: Quads/Hip-Ham/Abs

FRI: Hypertrophy Upper

* 6x3: Speed Bench/Push Press

* 3-5 x 6-8: Supersets of push/pulls with prehab/arms/battling ropes at the end

SAT or SUN: Conditioning (Sled, Hill Sprints, occasionally light implements)

**DIET**

Diet is pretty simple. I'm get 3500-4000 calories a day with carbs at breakfast (8:00AM, potatoes, oats), intra-workout (11:30-1:00PM, dextrose), and immediately post-workout (2:00PM, starchy--rice, more potatoes, whatever), low-carb after that. I hit around 250 grams of protein a day and love me some cruciferous greens.

**ME**

I'm 20 years old, male, and 5'8""/172# at estimated 12% bodyfat. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/TD6g6) are pictures taken today after a long weekend off from the gym for a family reunion. I stopped paying the Weider Tax and started seriously training in 2010 and have done Chaos and Pain or 5/3/1 for the majority of my lifting career since then. While I let my conditioning decline during Strongman training (the competition was very heavy and low-rep and I needed the energy for events), I was a regional rower in high school, wrestled for two years, and played a year of club lacrosse last year. One of my goals here is to get my conditioning back via sled and sprint so I can lean out to around 10%. I already have high sex drive and ample hubris and am fairly certain that I am not testosterone-deficient.

I also drink a lot of yerba mate (3-5 cups a day on work days) and matcha green tea (1-2 cups a day).

I will, obviously, be eating at a major surplus before and during the tapering period. Lots of fats, carbs and protein.

But more importantly, what about all of the other supplements that I take?  Are there supplements that should probably be cycled even though the bottle doesn't tell you to?  Is there something that I DEFINITELY shouldn't be doing that I might be doing right now?

I know there are the basics, like taking stims with other stims, but what about the more ""obscure"" pro-tips with generally widely used supplements (protein, creatine, fish/flax/etc oils, multi's, etc.)?

For example, some basic ones I can think of off the top of my head:

* Zinc = at night, empty stomach
* Melatonin = empty stomach
* GABA = without protein
* Vitamin D = with fat
* Calcium = with food, timing = spread throughout the day as opposed to a calcium bomb
* l-tyrosine = can block absorption of other aminos if taken in high or chronic doses.
* casein = night

I understand that this question is ridiculously broad, but hell, maybe if we get enough info together, maybe we could have a Absorption/Timing FAQ or something?  Searching the web for each and every supplement is quite cumbersome, but it's terrible for people that just don't know.  It's amazing how different the results are when you search, ""what shouldn't I take with creatine/don't take with creatine"" vs "" Creatine caffeine.""

So if you happen to know of a common mistake that people make with their supplements, mind throwing out a PSA of the wisdom you know?

- Vitamin A Tablet (MVs): 2500IU

Now because the Oil is high in EPA and DHA, I could pretty much half the dosage and STILL get more than most Oil Supps, so would this be the safest way of taking both the Cod Liver Oil, MVs and even the Vitamin D supp?

Ok i've always been an active person, playing hockey and lacrosse all throughout my youth up through high school, always active yet still overweight due to poor diet. 

Turn clock forward to last May I was 20 years old 6-1 and 255 lbs.  That summer is where I made monumental changes, after taking a nutrition class I changed my diet to low fat, low/no carb, high protein and took up running as a hobby.  After running about 3 miles 5 times a week and a very strict diet, by the time August came around and it was time to head back to college, I had dropped my mile from ~10min to 7:01 (PR) and lost 50 lbs.  The transformation was unreal.

While at college I play club ice hockey practicing 2 times a week plus 2 games on the weekend, very physically demanding, continued to run about 3 times a week throughout the semester until it got too cold.  Hockey, running and maintaining a good diet I was able to maintain my weight dropping to as low as 205 lbs for the rest of the year. 

Now fast forward to this summer, 21 years old 205 lbs. I was really happy about my weight, but the rapid loss of weight over the past year has cost me a lot of my muscle.  That is why I decided that this summers plan was going to be following Shawn T's Insanity with my brother.  Insanity was crazy to say the least for the most part we followed the first month exactly per the calendar.  The second month we tried to follow as closely as possible but vacation, hectic work schedules, and aggravating an old shoulder injury we stopped with 9 days left in the program, and I've decided to just keep running for exercise until I go back to school.  For the most part i'm happy with the results, showing obvious loss of body fat and increase in muscle tone.  

Now that i'm close to my goal weight ~200 lbs i'm looking to really get into a good lifting routine as well as play hockey when I return to school next week.  I want to continue toning and really focus on gaining muscle.  I've been doing some research lately on bodybuilding.com and created a BodySpace account and also downloaded the iPhone app.  While on body space I found ""Steve Cooks Big Man On Campus"" workout which I plan on starting on August 18th

My biggest questions have to do with supplements.  What should I be taking?? My knowledge goes as far as knowing to drink a whey protein shake after lifting and that's about it.   I found this MusclePharm supplement stack http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/musclepharm/ufc-fight-stack.html that seems to be a really good bang for my buck and has a lot of good things inside it, including: 
Amino1, Armor-V, Assault, and Z-core PM. Also in my ""wishlist"" are fish oil gel capsules.  

Are these supplements what I should be taking? Is this a good stack (I already own a tub of protein)? And if so, when do I take those supplements throughout the day? Also, any knowledge you could pass me on supplements would be greatly appreciated!!

I did the iron cocktail for a while (1000% DV of iron in liquid form taken in orange juice, essentially iron loading) and I just got it tested again this past week. It was only up to 18 ng/ml. 

Is there a delay, or do I need to be supplementing again? Is this little of an increase abnormal? Or did it bounce up and then deplete? I just want a better picture of what's going on. I'm getting worried that maybe I have trouble absorbing iron or something.

1346969088.0,9,self.Supplements,zh0b4,A (hopefully) level-headed c4 review (x-post from fitness),11,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/zh0b4/a_hopefully_levelheaded_c4_review_xpost_from/,"So I am pretty much done with my first tub of C4 and I thought I would share my experience with others.  I hope I can give a level-headed review of the product.  DISCLAIMER: I am sure that people reading this have different fitness goals so I will refrain from calling my observations ""pros"" or ""cons.""

**About me**: I am 5'9 and 150 lbs.  I rowed for a year+ in college and before that played a year of basketball and football in high school.  I am naturally skinny/fit thanks to good genetics, but I started weightlifting as a hobby when I found it enjoyable during my rowing offseason (I have been weightlifting casually for 2-3 years now).  I have trouble gaining too much weight at once (my biggest gain was 5lbs when I first started squatting) and I have a rather sensitive stomach to stimulants.  Oh and I have minor hyperhydrosis (I sweat easily).

**My workout routine**: I could only work out one day a week during my time taking c4 so this is what I did.  Squats/deadlifts to start; bench press superset with bent-over rows; barbell curls superset with close-grip bench press (tris); ab circuit (cable crunch, jack-knife, side bends, reverse crunches on pull-up bar, etc.).  All exercises are working set of 6 reps except for ab circuit which I do 20 reps.

**Other supplements**: When I started c4, I also started adding creatine mono (ON) 5g to my ON whey or my Syntha-6 (when I was overseas that is all I had).  I just recently started taking opti-men so I won't factor that into my review.

**Other PWOs that I tried**: I have tried No-xplode (3 times without the caffeine), 1mr sample, neurotech (2 or 3 times), BRX (2 or 3 times).  I stopped No-xplode because it upset my bowel movements and it made me feel really tight and hot/sweaty too early in my workout.  I stopped neurotech because of 1,3 dimeth in it.  I stopped BRX because it also made me really sweaty early on.  I stopped 1mr because it gave me EXPLOSIVE and painful diarrhea.


***REVIEW*** (sorry it's taking a while to get here):

**Dosage**: I found that one scoop was enough in the beginning, but there were times when I tried 1.5 or 2 scoops.  I'm not sure if it helped more but the times I did and it was 5pm or later, I had a terribly tough time falling asleep.  A couple times I couldn't sleep at all.  I may be stimulant sensitive.

**Timing**: Again, in the beginning, it took around 10 minutes to kick in, but later the effects were less pronounced and probably took more like 30 minutes to kick in.

**Potency**: As you can tell, I began to develop tolerance for c4.  In the beginning, it didn't matter if I was wide awake or groggy, I would take it and feel the right effects, but later on it was more difficult to get that same level.  Because of my work schedule, I could only use it once a week before my sunday lift.

**What did I feel?**:

I generally felt a bit more motivated to lift and more confident that I could push myself without hitting that wall of fatigue or indifference.

I also felt a subtle increase in energy - not quite a wired feeling that some may want, but it was enough for me.

I did not receive much if any pump/tingles/etc.  This was nice because I am not someone looking to bulk up too dramatically and when I did feel that in other products, it scared me and honestly fatigued me much quicker in my workout.

And whether it was the workout or the aftereffects of c4, I started crashing about 20 minutes after my workout ended.

**Side effects?**: Increased libido in general.  Trouble falling asleep.


*I know everyone loves ratings and whatnot so I will give a quick breakdown here (please take this lightly because I think my anecdotal review is more helpful):*

**ENERGY**: 8/10 (wasn't overwhelming and felt natural - decreased with time)

**FOCUS**: 9/10 (generally felt motivated and rarely quit a workout - decreased with time)

**PUMP**: 2/10 (I did not get any pump)

**SIDE EFFECTS**: 7/10 (no upset stomach, but trouble falling asleep occasionally and developed tolerance)


**Would I recommend?**:  Yes, especially for someone like me who is (1) just getting into PWOs, (2) not aiming to bulk/pump up that dramatically, and (3) has a sensitive stomach.


Again, I apologize for taking so long with the review and perhaps not writing it in a format that people are used to - I tried my best to be mindful that people have different goals.  I am sure that people who are as curious as I was about PWO will read this fully and I invite anyone to ask me more questions about the product and my experience with it.  Oh and if anyone could recommend a new PWO (I'm thinking animal rage/shock therapy), please let me know, too.

I'm 100kg, 6'5"" and am about 19-21% BF. I worked out my BMR as about 2300 using one calculator, and 2000 using another, and given that I've always seemed to gain weight when eating at my supposed BMR, I will be trying a pretty drastic cut. For that reason I also want some supplements that will help me retain my muscle while losing weight. I also think I might try doing a lean gains style diet.

Supps I have (or are on their way) are: Green tea extract, methy-synephrine, Compound 20, DAA, PES erase, Grape seed extract, Calcium, magnesium, Vitamin D, Creatine, Zinc, Carallumna Adscendens Fimbriata Extract

My plan is as follows:

8AM: Multivitamin, fish oil, coffee, 60mg methyl-synephrine, Green tea extract, CAF extract

After this I will do some LISS cardio for about 30-45 minutes

4.30PM: Preworkout meal of a protein shake and some fruit (~600-700 calories), 2 caps Compound 20, coffee

5.30PM: Green tea extract then go do workout (M/W/F weights, cardio every day)

8.30PM: Post workout meal (~700-800 calories), 2 caps compound 20, CAF, Magnesium and Zinc

10:30PM: Calcium and Vitamin D, 250g cottage cheese (~250 calories) on weights days

Is it worth running the DAA and Erase on top of this as well? I was running these plus creatine until I started to notice my hair thinning a bit, but this turned out to be folliculitis rather than MPB (or so I hope).

My reasoning behind the whole shebang is this: Compound 20 is a B2 adrenergic agonist, helps retain muscle and mobilise fat. Recommended to dose with meals, not stimulating so I can take it with dinner since I won't be having breakfast.

Green tea before exercise to increase thermogenesis, bit wary since i know it can affect absorption of other supplements

CAF extract is an appetite suppressant and helps mobilise fat stores, taken at breakfast to last me the rest of the day, taken with dinner to prevent me craving desert.

Methyl-synephrine is a B2/B3 agonist, taken of a morning so it won't interact with Compound 20 too much and I'll still get more lipolysis happening. Should preserve muscle mass too as far as I understand.

Vitamin D, zinc, magnesium, calcium, fish oil and multivitamin are just for general health and wellbeing.

Usually my total time I devote to working out every night is around 3 hours (of course some of that time during weightlifting is me waiting on my partner/resting. I also follow a keto diet (fairly strictly, though once every couple weeks I'll have a ""cheat""). I actually carry most of my weight very proportionally meaning I have an hourglass shape and thick legs proportionate to my body, but I've been taking progress photos and after reviewing the photos and seeing how I carry fat I'm especially seeking to reduce my neck fat. I know the best way to do this is by working out, dieting and getting a proper amount of sleep which I definitely am already doing, but based off of what I have been reading about places that fat tends to settle on me I believe that reducing my cortisol levels would be beneficial. As cortisol is a stress hormone, some of the supplements I have been reading about claim to reduce anxiety which I believe would also be helpful to me as I have a history of stressing out to the point that I experience physical pain. Anyway, I want to add one of these supplements to my daily intake, but I'm not sure which route I should go.

I'm not very knowledgeable about supplements and this is what I take at the moment - [Equate Complete multivitamin](http://tracker.dailyburn.com/nutrition/equate_equate_complete_multivitamin_calories), [Spring Valley Fish Oil 1000 mg](http://www.healthy-oil-planet.com/spring-valley-fish-oil.html), [Spring Valley Natural Potassium Gluconate](http://www.sparkpeople.com/myspark/Calorie_Finder.asp?FoodID=59473939) 

Okay, so as you can see, I take 3 pills already and I'm not sure what to add to that to help reduce cortisol levels. 

I've done some research online and have seen all kinds of suggestions that range all over the place from Magnolia Bark, Rhodiola, B-vitamins(B6 and B5 aka pantothenic acid), Glutamine, Phosphatidylserine, Theanine, Vitamin C, Phytosterols, Green Tea, Ginseng, Chamomile to even Epimedium (Horny Goat Weed), etc ... 

I'm a total newbie at all of this. How can I know what actually works and what is just nonsense?

I've been trying to read up on how to approach supplements, but it seems like there is a ton of conflicting opinions and info out there.

From what I have gathered, Gold Standard is (one of) the best proteins out there, since it also includes BCAA's, it tastes good, etc. Since I am getting low on what protein I have(AMP), this is sitting in my Amazon cart currently.

So does that make for a decent pre-workout drink? Should I go further? My roommate has a new thing of Xtend, which seems to be a similar product to Jack3d and White Flood, from what I can tell. Is it worth it to try this as well? If I do use Xtend(or one of the others) as a pre-workout supp, should I do it instead of the Protein? Or should I mix it with the protein? Should I drink it all before starting, or do more of an intra-workout thing with it? Or do I separate them all? Would mixing all of the above in milk be okay if i need more calories/protein for the day?

I've been hesitant to try any of the specific pre-workout supps because I normally don't start working out till 4 PM and I am rather sensitive to Caffeine. Well, at least I think I still am, I have a drastically lower intake these days(since quitting soft drinks and going low carb, and losing 100 pounds). I had considered moving my workouts to the morning to avoid this issue, but this conflicts with my workout partners' schedule a little, and i have been considering trying leangains, but that would not mesh well together either(ugh, so many conflicting options!) since I don't want my eating window to be completely encompassed by my 8 hours at work.

On a less important note, I take fish oil and a multivitamin most mornings as well. I keep hearing how important Vitamin D is, so i am thinking of buying that as well. My diet is currently in flux, I had been doing Keto for a long while, but I'm headed more toward Paleo right now, and am considering combining it with Leangains.

Anecdotal reports online suggest Synephrine is almost the same as Ephedrine. Do your guys have any experience with it?

According to the [PDF mention is this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/psdez/interesting_independent_discussion_of_various/) (a document for US Miltary Divers, p.39):

""Scientiﬁc Evidence: Very few scientiﬁc studies have examined the efﬁcacy of synephrine with regard 
to weight loss. One animal study using rats considered the hemodynamic effects of synephrine 
treatment in portal hypertensive rats (2). In this study, synephrine signiﬁcantly ameliorated the 
hyperkinetic state in both portal vein ligation and bile duct ligation rats. The mean arterial 
pressure in both groups was signiﬁcantly reduced, as well as, systemic and portal vascular 
resistance. 

The study concluded that an eight-day administration of synephrine had a beneﬁcial 
hemodynamic effect in both groups of rats. A human study was conducted to determine the 
cardiovascular effects of synephrine on normotensive adults (3). Subjects consumed 8 ounces of 
Seville orange juice and water in a cross-over method followed by another ingestion 8 hours later. 
A signiﬁcant increase in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and mean arterial 
pressure was noted in response to ingestion of the Seville orange juice. 

In a review by Preuss et al. (2), a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
study using a combination of Citrus aurantium, caffeine and St. John’s Wort, in combination with 
a restricted diet was described. Participants receiving the supplement combination had 
signiﬁcantly greater fat losses, but not weight losses as compared with placebo and controls (2). 
The review also describes a study involving female participants who were given no supplement 
the ﬁrst week of a weight loss regime and Citrus aurantium the second week. During the ﬁrst 
week, the mean weight lost was 0.94 kg, whereas during the second week, mean weight loss was 
2.40 kg (2). 

The researchers felt this was signiﬁcant because typically more weight is lost in the 
ﬁrst week of a diet protocol, even if only attributed to water loss. In sum, although, Citrus 
aurantium may be a reasonable thermogenic agent, more studies are needed to establish this 
deﬁnitively, and determine the risks used under various physiologic stressors. """,,False,,t5_2qhb8,True,,,True,t3_qcw8r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/qcw8r/is_synephrine_as_effect_as_ephedrine_when_used/,

### **Stats:**

* Sex: Male

* Age: 25

B.) Lifting: (3 days a week - 4 Sets x 8 Reps)



* Squats

* Bench Presses (Dumbbell)

* Bent-Over Rows (Dumbbell)

-Should I consider a whey protein supplement (breakfast, inbetween meals, post workout etc)?  

-Should I consider a creatine supplement to help with muscle recovery?

-Any other suppliments to consider other than my daily multi-vitamin &amp; omega-3 fish oil?

What amazed me is that although common to bought separately ketoacids are rarely part of protein and creatine products where they are needed more than anything.

Instead these supplements are stuffed with glutamine and taurin, things that in a way suffocate the kidney eg. inhibit the glutamine synthase enzyme and makes blood levels of ammonia, creatinin and taurine explode after protein digestion or physical exercise (increase fatigue). Exactly opposite of what most users need (professional athletes, hobbyist, bodybuilders etc) while I can't remember seeing even Ketoglutaric acid included in any protein product I bought so far. AKG binds to ammonia (toxic and corrosive chemical, product of protein digestive enzymes) to form Glutamine and concentrated protein powder digestion without it can be quite hard for the body.

Hey there Reddit.

My name is Colin Popell. 

I’d like to share with you the first public statement about my new company, Noo-Mix LLC. I took a look at the current nootropic market, and it leaves much to be desired.

A lot of the supplement market lacks a scientific bearing, and unfortunately this is true for a lot of nootropic suppliers as well. This is a problem, because I’m a firm believer that the nootropics market is one that should be supported and helped to grow.

So I decided to do my part to change it. Noo-Mix LLC will be a science based, as transparent as possible, research friendly company built with the help of, and to the benefit of, the communities it interacts with. We won’t sell you any supplements we can’t find data that supports, we’ll conduct tests and gather data as much as possible, and we’ll pull products we find to either have adverse effects or no effect.

**How are we going to do this?** I am trying to build the most comprehensive data set of the effect of various stacks, demographics, interactions, backgrounds, and any other variables that might affect interactions with nootropics.

We’re also pretty sure we’re going to offer a few features no other company yet offers, but we’ll keep that on the down-low for now.

**Where do we want to go with this?** Well, fairly obviously I’d like the company to grow and make money. I’d also like to spread nootropics more into the mainstream on college campuses (less reliance on amphetamines by people who don’t understand them), clear up misconceptions of nootropics, and gather the largest database of nootropic interactions in the world.

I’m a transhumanist too, and I’d like to use this as a platform to help support the transhumanist community. All of my investors are going into this with the understanding that a portion of our profits may be reinvested into other emerging technologies, using this company as a launch platform. I don’t want to go into details here, but you can bet that money will be going into interesting projects in both drug and technological research.

**How can you help us?** Pretty easy, actually. As ambitious as my goals might be, I’m only starting out with a finite amount of cash. So linked at the top and bottom of this page is a survey on your nootropic habits. Feel free to fill it out in as much detail or as little detail as you want (though more is obviously preferable to me), but please fill it out. The more people who fill it out, the better data we’ll get, and the better we can optimize our initial expenses. Plus it gives us market data so that we can get more money from investors to expand faster, and to serve our customers better.

Sorry, tl;dr That’s okay, I know it was wordy. Basically, new supplement company wants to set a scientific and business standard, wants your business, wants to support the community, and wants data on your nootropic habits.

* 3. I've also been drinking enough coffee to kill a dwarf since I was in high school (26 year old dude now). While I do get a good boost if I'm caffeinated on an empty stomach, I would love to compound the effect without vibrating out of existence.

For instance, it seems Creatine is a high-value add, where the ""cost+difficulty"" ratio to ""improvement"" is high. I don't have an example of a low-value add, but let's say it's a supplement that would make me do 1% better, but costs $200 and needs to be taken every two hours, all day. 

So far, it seems I should add creatine, B3+K2, fish oil, BCAA and glutamine (already doing BioX protein shakes post-workout, and C4 and creatine pre-workout). 

Also, since it probably makes a diff, I've been working out for over a year, upgraded to a 4-or-5-a-week routine, currently  working on dropping the last 25 ish lbs, moving some heavy-ass weights (or, working up to it), working on an even balance of hypertrophy/strength, although I do have 3 months of cardio upcoming to get better for hiking season. 

Anyways... what are some suggestions for the most valuable additions to my life?

I guess i'll give some background so you guys know where I'm coming from and what i'm trying to accomplish.  1) i'm a fat guy, late 20s.  2) Gyno moobs since early teens.  3) Started lifting again 2 months ago(did some in HS).  4)Started on low carb, very ""clean"" diet 4 months ago.   

So i've made some headway in loosing the extra pounds and lifts are slowing climbing.  So, i'm happy with that but I've been thinking a supplement regiment could help support/accelerate my body's transition and boost my general health.  So i'm looking to get Stronger, lose the fat and get rid of the gyno.   So here is the stack i'm thinking of after cruising Examine and google.  please shoot it down/suggest better alternatives/shit i missed compleatly:

Creatine 5g (been taking for 2 weeks) 

standard ""mens"" Multi-Vit (been on it for awhile)

I3C: 200mg  for Aromatase Inhibition + extra health goodies. 

Longifolia Jack:  200mg test boost, and Aromatase Inhibition?

D-Aspartic acid:  3g Seems to be very popular test booster 

Fucoxanthin (Xathigen): 200mg  fat burner/metabolism booster

Also, any advice on how to recognize quality brands for this stuff would be great.  The ridiculous ""Yo Broster! this shit gets you jacked!!"" style of branding I see on most all of these type products doesn't feed my confidence.  I'm just can't tell what's bull shit and whats not.

x/post with r/fitness, but I'm not getting a response there.

I develop tolerance very quickly, when it comes to stimulants. When cutting, I'll typically use the normal 25mg ephedrine sulfate / 200 mg caffeine three times per day. (I'm by no means new to this sort of thing, by the way.)

The first day, I feel fantastic. Super energetic and determined. A workout is powerful and intense. I have immense focus and usually end up getting a ridiculous amount of things done during the day. I'm calling people up, getting things done, taking a piece of the world for myself, et cetera. The second day, I feel but only slightly energetic; maybe 25% of what I felt the first day. The third day, I always feel nothing. Even if I ease into it by upping the dosage only slightly.

I would very much like for these stimulatory effects to remain. I get far better workouts (essentially as I might with any preworkout, such as Jack3d or whatever else; which is also easy to develop a tolerance to) and tend to be fiendishly productive and just immensely focused outside of the gym. I know it's probably not possible to get them every day, but even for a couple of days per week would fit quite well with workouts and productivity.

I've read through the [Examine](http://examine.com/faq/do-i-need-to-cycle-ephedrine.html) article on the subject. It suggests that the receptors resensitize fairly quickly, which implies that cycling would work, but doesn't specify any sort of cycle length - since I adapt within two days, I'm thinking that any cycle would have to be two days on followed by some indeterminate number of days off.

A load of anecdotal evidence around the internet suggests that Benadryl (diphenhydramine) taken at night will help resensitize the receptors and improve sensitivity to EC more quickly. Of course, there's no hard evidence.

I'd like to hear any advice - scientific, anecdotal, or whatever - for maintaining the stimulatory effects of the EC stack. Ever cycle it? Ever try it with Benadryl? Any experiences you'd like to share?

My question is, would it make sense to only stop taking the caffein for the 4 weeks and continue to take just the ephedrine? It's well known that cycling off of caffein is a good idea, and I realize I would lose the synergistic effects of the EC combo, but it seems to me like I may still get the effects of the ephedrine if I run it solo.

Thanks to Rhinock^@Getsupps.com for the shot to try these out!
 
I am now beginning week 5 of my D-AA/Erase Stack. If you would like to read up on these supplements, Silverhydra did a brief overview on [PES Erase](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/wbwv6/just_looked_into_pes_erase_and_the_active/), however I had a hard time finding an unbiased review of D-AA. 

Cycle: 3 weeks on/1 off/ 3 on

**Pros:**

* Body composition seems to be a little better, muscles feel fuller than at the beginning. However, this could be in relation to the new program I have been using as well. Diet has not changed so that would not really be a contributing factor.

* The big question on D-AA is almost always about sex drive. For myself, I confirm this has increased my drive substantially (read: longer, stronger, harder, faster). I also started this log with a low test level across the board so this may not pertain nearly as much for those with normal levels. I will do f/u bloodwork after my final week to confirm.

* Not sure if it is related, but I wake up more energized than normal (I hate mornings) and when I go to bed, I fall asleep faster and sleep better than I have in quite some time.

**Cons**

* With increased test, comes puberty symptoms (backne). Though, I was prone to is as a teenager so if you were not, the recurrance will probably not be noticible.

**Non-Issue**

* Hair Loss: Not experienced at all.

* Aggression: No increase at all.

I have not really noticed significant size or strength increases, however the benefits I have seen have still been worth the money it would cost for these supplements if they are along the lines of what you are looking to achieve.

So I've been trying various supplements for a year.  I got tested a year ago and found that I had exceedingly low Vitamin D levels (like 8 ng/ml - below healthy levels). After 6 months of heavy supplementation I got it up to a healthy 60 ng/ml.  However, I didn't notice any chances, feel any different etc.

Same sort of story with various aphrodiasic-like/ testosterone boosting supplements (for example Horny Goat weed) I took relgiously.  No effects at all that I could notice.

Again same with melatonin - no effect at any dosage level and my sleep patterns don't change with it.

Same with Fish oils.

Overall, I just feel let down and am starting to think the supplement industry is all a hoax.

Also, what have the general experiences been with Yohimbine HCL w/ Caffeine? I was thinking of adding in Green Tea Extract as well, and possibly down the road cycling in Ephedra. I have had good success while just taking the Green Tea Extract with proper diet and exercise. 

**UPDATE:** I took the initial dose about an hour before my cardio, which was 10 mg Yohimbine, I will be increasing to 22.5 mg as of Wednesday. Did LISS, felt pretty good and a little tingly the hour before, but I will probably feel a fuller effect starting when I up the dosage. From what it seems from the Lyle Mcdonald FAQ's thread, its best to take it fasted in the morning pre-cardio, and at night post-dinner time on non-cardio days as the dose may be too intense prior to a weight training workout, and being on keto with the possible addition of TKD may negate the effects of Yohimbine once I take in some high-glycemic food.",,False,,t5_2qhb8,True,,,True,t3_j5o6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/j5o6l/starting_yohimbine_hcl_today_some_questions/,

Submitted here since I think everybody stopped visiting my blog due to my month long hiatus and you guys care about this stuff more than fittit :(

A tl;dr is:

- Studied compounds are Tribulus Terrestris, Maca, Eurycoma Longifolia, Ecdysterone, and Horny Goat Weed

- Maca has no legitimate evidence behind it

- Eurycoma works in hypogonadism and has not been shown to work in any healthy population

- Horny goat weed (also known as Icariin) has only been shown to work in reproductively injured mice, but has a plausible mechanism behind it

- Tribulus has had unsuccessful human trials, perhaps due to low dosing. It has a probable mechanism and has been shown to increase test when injected, but oral ingestion is still not proven. Thus supplemental usage is solely a 'well, it should work' theory.

- Ecdysterone has not been shown to increase test, but it shares similarities to test and may induce test-like effects directly via acting on the receptors. However, the one study (low dose) that used it had no effects on body composition, and so ecdysterone still remains an understudied compound

The last one looks promising. And as much as I want to 'put a nail in the coffin' of these compounds, there just isn't enough evidence to do so.

I've been bodybuilding and conditioning for years with wonderful results, but recently came under internal injury for unrelated reasons. Because of that, among other things to recover, I have to take 5 tbsp of Milk of Magnesia every night. (For those that don't know, it's largely an osmotic laxative that draws water into the colon and clears things out. Heavily diuretic, lots of Magnesium.) I've also taken Creatine for years.

The first thing that happened was, the following morning, I lost almost all the water under my skin. It was pretty great, and I looked instantly shredded. I lost 3-5lbs of water weight, and my muscles looked the same. After a week, however, the effects evened out on my skin, and I started having a couple of heart arrhythmias at random throughout the day. I read this could be from dehydration or low sodium or potassium balance. I already did drink lots of water evenly spaced throughout the day (10-15 8oz cups minimum), so I upped my sodium intake and supplemented with potassium, which seemed to kick it. I've had no issues like that since.

2-3 weeks out, however, I experienced a sudden visible loss in muscle size. They don't feel as hard, look as big, and during workouts, I don't get the same level of pump no matter what I do. I didn't really lose any strength. I had to lay off a couple of exercises I needed to get back into, but for the most part it was all comparable. My bench didn't skip a beat, nor did anything else I kept to, but the visual muscle loss was everywhere, even areas involved with what I'm the same or better at like the bench.

My main question is whether or not this could be similar to the effects of coming off of Creatine and losing the water it packed into the muscle. I'm mostly concerned because I'm hoping once I'm better, I can put it all back on and get back to it fairly easily. I was obese growing up, and turning that around exponentially has been a big part of my life and career ever since.

For anyone that knows more, could it be from the consistent diuretic effects of the Milk of Magnesia? Consistent instances of dehydration interfering with Creatine volumization in the muscles? Or some electrolyte imbalance still in place that's having similar effects?",,False,,t5_2qhb8,False,,,True,t3_1ccgsd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ccgsd/dehydration_andor_electrolyte_imbalance_affect_on/,

* Biotin &amp; the Multivitamins/Minerals to help towards hair loss prevention and general health. I know Biotin doesn't really tackle baldness or receding hair, but I am using it as an experiment to on it's effects against thinning.

* Melatonin for general longevity and long term health. I don't take it for its sleep regulation, I don't have problems sleeping at all.

* Whey protein is for building muscle. Though I am not a body builder and don't aim to bulk up as such. I just have a high metabolism and am quite skinny. I've found that general weight exercise and whey protein helps me bulk out and not look too slim. Also whey protein is great for hair growth.

I've been doing this for a bit but without supps other than creatine and beta alanine. 

The stack:

PreWorkout One: Resistance training

* 25g protein &amp; some 60-ish carbs (peanut butter sandwich and whey drink)
* 7g Citrulline malate(cause blood vessels)
* 5g creatine (duh?)
* 3g beta alanine(never knew if I should take more or less.
* No caffeine because my colon(?) is thenthitive.

Post WO One @ 700 am

* Food. (Usually small meal before breakfast which is two hours later.)(Some cornflakes, protein, banana and someone suggested I add sugar if my flakes don't have it?)

Mid day, food. Always protein and leafy greens(romaine lettuce and spinach.) Mostly always some strawberries or pineapple.

Pre Workout Two: Cardio - Running (from mild to not-to-intense depending on day)

* Green Tea Extract 30 min before to poo, it's a little energy boost and some other good stuff supposedly.
* 30mg Zinc (2mg copper) cause I sweat a lot from running and sauna, and wanna experiment the testosterone thing.
* Peanut butter sandwich cause carbs.

Post Workout Two: @ 800pm

Food.

Before bed:

* Melatonin cause sleep
* 300mg Magnessium (should it be less or more?)
* Vita D causegoes well with Magnessium and the guy with the username.

I bought some other supps too but don't know when I should take them or with what.

* Vita B 1 
* Vita B 7 
* Fish Oil ( my shoulders suck and my wrists are small(people  suggest I take it when waking up because it competes with nothing but I take my pre workout right away and head out quickly)
* Vita A

Another Q, because I'm using a lot of glycogen(or glucose?), should I eat more of something specific? Should I avoid carbs after my cardio?

Google searches showed lots of people asking the same questions in other forums. I'm coming here because, frankly, I'm at a loss...  

Summary: I took OT for three weeks and started getting pretty serious achey knees and a resulting irritated IT band on my right leg. Nothing changed--not in my workouts, sleep habits, eating habits--anything (I'm on a Wendler 5/3/1 program, and I stick to it, so I know my workouts were the same with similar levels of output). After a week of that, I stopped taking OT but continued with everything else (lifting, cycling, etc.). Within four days of cutting off usage of OT, the knee pain was gone (IT band pain lingered for a few more days).  

This is extremely anecdotal, I know, but that's why I'm here: **Are there any ingredients in OT that could conceivably lead to joint pain? Maybe due to interference with other factors/foods?**

Here's what might be relevant with regard to me: I am practicing a ketogenic diet; I cycle regularly (my bike fits, at it's worst it was a contributing factor); I have seasonal allergies; I upped my protein intake by about 15 percent in the last two months; I'm 5'9"", 189 pounds (have lost 21 pounds in the last four months); my diet is clean and free of processed foods--I hit my keto macros almost perfectly.

I figure you guys are knowledgeable.)


I kind of foresee this post being crosslinked to r/fitnesscirclejerk, but hear me out.  The modern environment is way to sterile, and I think it's one of the leading drivers behind the rise in autoimmune conditions, obesity, and mental health conditions.  The immune system is out of whack, resulting in inflammation.  How can we fix it?

**[Fecal transplants](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFecal_bacteriotherapy&amp;ei=Azt3T5fqCaq80QGgp-DeDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGldc4qaMq7I3zIjOjgtMITd90FMA)** are the obvious option, but the medical community hasn't really developed it.  You could DIY, but it is difficult to find a healthy donor, and it could be dangerous.  It's also absolutely disgusting. So not viable (yet...I'm still hoping big pharma develops it into a pill-form at the local pharmacy!).


**Probiotics** won't do it.  Though they still can have many benefits, probiotics are transitory and dependent upon continuous pill-popping.  Also, they cover a very small percentage of the strains that exist in a healthy human being.  **Kefir** may be an exception.




**Eating dirt** is a hopeful option.  Similarly, eating **[worms](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelminthic_therapy&amp;ei=Bzt3T4DeGOT30gHZ3_GmDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVgu9dME8mpTDrEsuIzWBhAz-0Fg)**, or at the very least, eating **unwashed, muddy vegetables** straight from the backyard garden.  THESE ARE POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS.

Lastly, simply **playing dirty**.  I suspect that sex, kissing, as well as simply interacting with children, livestock and pets, can foster increased gut biodiversity.  As far as I can tell, this seems like the best option..

If you avoided antibiotics, were breastfed, and born vaginally, your gut health is probably superb and you don't need to worry about this.  However, just one round of antibiotics permanently alters the gut flora.

My mom got these ""all natural pills"" called [Remophan plus](http://www.amazon.com/Reumofan/dp/B006ZTP5Y6/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) from her friend at work. The pills are manufactured in Tijuana Mexico (my skeptisim began right there...). I spent some time researching it on the internet, [but the reviews I find all seem to be a bit sketchy](http://www.amazon.com/Reumofan/product-reviews/B006ZTP5Y6/ref=sr_1_1_cm_cr_acr_img?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1) (seriously all 5 star perfect reviews). 

I decided to try a pill anyway and my knee pain was gone within 2 hours. There is no way that a glucosamine, chondroitin, and ""all natural"" extracts can make pain go away that fast. 

I am starting to think that there may be cortisone or some form of steroid in the pills that the manufacturer is not listing on the [ingredient list](http://www.nopain.ws/Whats_in_it_). 

The website for the product states that many knock off versions of their product have hit shelves all throughout Latin America and these bootleg versions may have steroids, or strong pain relievers.

However, my personal experience differs, and I wonder if anyone can shed some light on to why.

Last time I took creatine was during a 9 week strength cycle leading up to my powerlifting meet. I weighed about 185 pounds, and intended on competing in the 181 pound class. About 3 days before the meet, I stopped taking creatine in order to shed a few pounds to make weight. Instead, I ended up dropping down from 185 pounds to 171 pounds in a matter of 3 days. I ended up feeling very tired at the meet, and missed a few lifts. Luckily, I still won my weight class.

Since the meet, I have stayed off creatine. Personally, I feel that I look much leaner and ""ripped"" since going off the creatine. During my strength cycle, when I weighed 185 pounds, I looked bloated and a little fat. 

Is there any reason that creatine would have caused me to hold on to 14 extra pounds?

So, any information would be lovely and most appreciated.

Multi vitamin(s). My hectic work/life schedule sometimes leaves me having quick meals that don't necessarily have all the proper nutrients. While I still try and eat as healthily as possible I am surely missing some nutrients. 

Creatine. I've never (in 5 years lifting) done creatine consistently. I'm ready to start. I just need to know what to look for and avoid? 

Pre-workout mix. I don't want a store bought pre-workout. I only drink caffeine regularly in my morning coffee. I've thought maybe I should start mixing Arginine and other supplements? On this topic I have no idea where to begin and would love some advice. 

Recovery/growth mix. What extra supplements do I need to work in for growth and recovery? I lift at least 3 days a week, mostly olympic lifts with crossfit workouts mixed in. I also bike or run as many days a week as I can. What should I start looking for or adding to promote recovery and growth?

My only goal is what I've always had as a goal, decrease or maintain body fat and maintain or increase muscle size/strength.

Hey everyone, sorry to bore you with another hold-my-hand pls post regarding supplements. Anyways, I've been taking Cellucor C4 for the past month now, and after reading examine.com's extensive review on creatine I'm going to try that. 

Well, here are my tedious questions:

* Should I cycle Cellucor C4? I intake caffeine only on workout days (wake up early day), does this affect C4 at all? It also seems that the effects of C4 are wearing off (or is this my caffeine intake that's ruining this?). **I no longer feel tingling sensations** (feels fucking amazing) unless I get my heartbeat up rather high; I also  don't get an energy rush like the first time I took it. What I still retain is the long-enduring energy for my whole workout, is this how this shit is suppose to work?

* Creatine (monohydrate) from what I understand isn't harmful, and is a very beneficial supplement. I know it's very water intensive, so **how much water should I drink a day**? On a good day I easily drink 3/4 of a gallon of water. Also, after reading examine.com's article on Creatine, they note some medical concerns. One of these would be Minor Liver Lesion they found, and they found in mice. Now I've taken some heavy drugs (acutane) that affect my liver, but I would not like to take anything like that again? **Is creatine hard on my liver**, is my question (**wtf is liver lesion in other words**)?


**TL;DR** I don't feel the effects of C4, should I cycle or remove caffeine from diet; Creatine, how much water should I be intaking, and is liver lesion bad, and would it be hard on my liver?

Hey, it's free for the first time, and looks to have many healthy uses. Some of these benefits are said to be increased testosterone, less anxiety, and enhanced libido. I've recently finished my first cycle of Liftmode's Tongkat Ali 200:1, so let me tell you about my experience.

  First of all, I mainly took this because I wanted an effective workout supplement. A supplement that gives me an extra kick in the ass when I lift, but doesn't get me jittery like caffeine or other substances that have stimulant properties. I noticed a slight increase in workout intensity, endurance, and I healed quite a bit faster sometimes when I was sore post workout. As far as a testosterone increase goes, I really can't tell. I had no blood tests done, so I cannot comment on that.

  For anxiety, I found that it does help. Not every day I took it, but most of the days I took it. I just feel a better sense of well being. It's nice for someone like me who has severe anxiety and depression, to feel more relaxed and positive.

  Regarding an enhanced libido, it's definitely there. Oh yeah, I can feel it! The gym isn't the only place I have more endurance, I'll just say that. I last longer in bed, am harder, and have a more intense climax. It's no insta-erection powder though, just know that. When you're in the mood, you simply get into that mood some more.

  Misc feelings: I felt better waking up and getting out of bed. I had more energy most days while using Tongkat Ali when I wake up.

  Overall, I'd say the most noticeable effects for me have been quicker healing from exercise related muscle soreness, a better sense of well being, ENHANCED libido, and feeling better when I wake up in the morning.

Currently trying to simplify!,7,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1cwdjd/i_think_i_may_take_totally_redundant_vitamins_and/,"Ive noticed that my fitness regiment, the supplements I'm taking, etc look more like a home with no plan that has been added onto over decades rather than a concise plan.


So I figured I might just post all the vitamins and supplements I'm taking, and see what people more educated than I on the topic think I might be sorely missing, redundant, or not really necessary.


For background, I am 38 6'5"", 225lbs and have been an athlete all my life. I'm in above average shape I'd say. I currently play competitive 2's beach volleyball at least 3-4 times a week, varying from 2 hours to 6 hours at a stretch, occasional tournaments, as well as a very strenuous 1 hr 'jump training"" class 3 times a week, which is a plyometrics volleyball specific workout. 2 days a week I lift weights for an hour with a buddy (the off days).


I try to have 2 or 3 protein shakes a day (when I'm hungry, I work from home), starting with breakfast, and eat regularly for dinner or lunch with veggies and honestly, usually a burger or something for dinner. i snack on yogurt and almonds. My shakes are made up a scoop of protein, a frozen banana, some blueberries or mixed frozen fruit from costco, and unprocessed oatmeal blended up.


So here goes.

Vitamins:
I buy almost all of them at costco or linberg nutrition by my house, and try to take one of each pill per day.

===========================

Initially it seems the B-100 complex is totally redundant. BUT, i do realize that because I exercise a LOT that higher instances of some of these might be great. The vitamin C could be doing good. I started on flax seed oil when I had eye surgery at the doctors request, and never let it go. maybe I can. The glucosamin seemed like a good idea andfer my ACL surgery, and never stopped... maybe I can. 

I've considered just outright mixing my protein powder and the creatine together so i dont have so many bottles on my counter. 

Any suggestions on holes I should fill, or vitamins/supplements I can stop taking without consequences?

She thinks it will be a solution to her metabolism/thyroid problems.  I've watched the videos from the two well-known doctors that are promoting Iodine supplementation but everything I have read from reputable sources say that our bodies can only tolerate very small amounts of iodine (1-2 mg) before it becomes toxic.

I know some of the studies are referencing urine or blood levels and not the amount you can consume but I am not able to find any valid source that talk about upper limits for consumption and in what form.

I have read that condensed kelp is not a good source due to the fact that the impurities are condensed as well.
She bought a product called Iodoral and the regimen she subscribes to calls for 12.5mg/day.  From what I've read the thyroid only needs a few micrograms of iodine to function properly.

If anyone is really interested she has normal TSH and T4 but very low T3.  Hormone drugs have not had any benefit for her but I dont recall the two she tried.

I don't mind her experimenting with Iodine supplementation as long as her dose is in safe limits.  I just need some help determining what those are.

**TLDR;** Does anyone know of a good source that talks about upper limits of iodine consumption?

The best would be one that references Iodide(potassium salt).

-Caffeine
-Beta-Alanine

Post-Workout:

With regard to Aspartame, I've been able to argue him down to the Phenylalanine. This is the point where he claims that it's basically a chemical that ages you... but what I don't understand is this: it's a necessary element of the human diet. Hell, it's found in breast milk. This one I feel like I'm on terra firma, more or less, but could use some rebuttal points as well. The whole ""it kills rats"" argument was easily refuted by explaining ph levels are higher in rats and therefore led to crystallization in the bladder.

-----
**Anecdotal evidence:** I can't really speak to them individually, but I can talk about the different groupings

* **Morning:** obviously, largely nootropics. I haven't experienced quite the intensity that the right tail reports (e.g. enhanced/more vivid colors, etc), but I have experienced a very noticeable increase in:

    (1) *Verbal acuity* - my sentence form, structure, vocabulary, &amp; flow work in a much more harmonious nature. It's probably my favorite effect

    (2) *More intelligent prioritization and organizational skills*, both personal and professional. I tend to carry an enormously large workload, and it often gets very hard to manage. Combined with my personal life, I tend to focus too much or too little time on certain tasks. Since starting my nootropic regimen, I have started balancing that much better - to the extent that other people (friends, boss, etc) are taking notice

    (3) *Motivation* - I don't really have many days where I'm dragging ass. I'm very much on the ball and eager to conquer the day.

    (4) *Alertness* - the effects take place approximately 20 minutes after ingestion. At that point, I start becoming very alert - both mental and sensory effects. It's a nice kick in the ass in the morning

    (5) The yohimbine and caffeine serve two purposes: (1) the former kick starts my endothermic metabolism while I fast, and (2) the later aids a bit with metabolism, but mostly it helps satiate while I fast. My first meal of the day is usually around 12p. Because I can't really attribute all of my progress to the former, I won't speak to it directly. That being said, I feel they're both pivotal in helping boost cutting while simultaneously bulking.

* **Midday:** I honestly can't speak to CoQ10 or vitamin D, mostly because I started fish oil before them. In regards to fish oil, they're mostly physical effects - my skin (softer, naturally moisturized), nails (stronger), &amp; hair (feels very supple and full) seem to be affected the most. I didn't get any colds/flu over the season, and that is very atypical, though I can't logically attribute all of that it to just fish oil. Re: CoQ10 &amp; vitamin D, I've read great things about the former, and I've had deficiencies of the latter come up in blood tests in the past.

* **Afternoon:** no major anecdotes other than taming appetite. The main goal here is to give a slight kick to endothermic metabolism before my workouts.

* **Night:** my sleeping patterns are measurably more restful. I have an app (Sleep as Android) that records my level physical movements &amp; auditory accompaniments each night, and I've seen that get gradually more restful while on this stack. I also feel much more rested in the morning, though you have to be careful with the melatonin. Everyone's mileage will vary in terms of tolerance, and even your own will vary on factors I have yet to determine - some mornings I wake up VERY groggy. I occasionally depend on my morning stack to get me going

* **Custom pre &amp; peri workout mix**: this has been huge. I noticed right away how much energy it was supplementing during my workouts, and I was able to start hitting weights that were previously getting difficult. When I started out on SS, my first big roadblock was hitting that mental barrier of double plates on squat (225). I had to reset twice before I finally hit it, but once I started the custom mix, I didn't do a single reset until I hit 285, and that's only been once.

Testosterone is converted to estrogen (via the enzyme aromatase) in fat cells in both men and women. In fact, most of the estrogen in males (and in post-menopausal women) comes from the conversion of testosterone in fat cells. Carrying more body fat for males means not only more estrogen, but also less testosterone (yet another reason for athletes to avoid getting too fat). Athletes who use anabolic steroids (or even prohormones) without using an anti-aromatase will get more conversion to estrogen if they are carrying more body fat. The metabolism of other hormones such as DHEA and androstenedione also occurs in fat cells.

",8,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/qlszv/respiratory_effects_from_13_dimethylamylamine/,"I took some 1,3 Dimethylamylamine with caffeine at the levels of 90mg, and 210mg respectively. I had been fasting for 10 hours so Stomach was pretty much empty. Administration route was oral and both were in liquid form (powder dissolved in water) before a morning abdominal workout.
ALso took 4g of L-arginine and 750mg vitamin C, 150mg vit.B6, 600mg taurine, 3g creatine, and 600mg beta alanine. All at the same time, and same form (disolved in water)
Blood pressure dropped pretty quickly so I got a powerade and ate some skittles - that seemed to help alot. 

About 30 minutes after administration I definitely felt the CNS stimulation from the combination and was reading through emails/reddit really fast. 

Anyway at about 45 minutes after administration I felt my breaths come into my lungs really smoothly... my lungs felt soft and silky and effortless. In addition about an hour in I felt a mild nasal decongestant effect - similar to Pseudoephedrine (sudafed).  Basically I was in a convienince store buying a powerade, and just taking in the most efficient breaths I've ever taken in my life. I wasn't aware that 1,3 had this effect at all (It wasn't simply L-arginine? because I take L-arginine all the time and don't feel this effect.)

During my Workout I felt like my blood pressure was low. HR was about 100bpm but my stroke volume felt pretty low. If I would have taken any more bottoming out could have been a possibility. Recovery from sets was fast fast fast, not sure if that was real or just the CNS stimulation blunting pain - probably the later. 
Definitely feeling an appetite suppressant effect (not hungry at all really) but this is supposed to be one of the effects of 1,3 (and of course caffeine). 

Euphoria: (Disclaimer: I don't pursue, desire, or want to use supplements for abuse in fact i haven't felt the need for recreation uses of substances -even alcohol- after my first regimen of nootropics but thats a different story entirely) **I'm simply reporting the effects I experienced.** 
So about about an hour from taking the caffeine and 1,3 Dimethylamylamine I definitely felt *different* my body felt like it had more of a liquid feel to it, I was doing some floor routines to work my abs and after every set I would finish the last rep and then proceed to feel a total body effect that extremely calming- slight melt into the floor feel, the muscles didn't feel sore at all and definately felt like I could keep going just seconds after reps-till-failure. Honestly the feeling was like an orgasm but spread evenly around every cell of the body. The respiratory effect and decongestion were still strong at this point (ans still are during typing ~3hours in). I don't think this effect will last with chronic usage of 1,3 and caffeine as I've read reports of the body blunting the effects of the CNS stimulation pretty quick. 


Edit: the recovery was probably from the beta-alanine I will probably stop taking this one because I feel like its combating my efforts to cause maximum muscle hypertrophy (noob theory: making my workokuts easy so my body dosn't need to adapt...)",,False,,t5_2qhb8,False,,,True,t3_qlszv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/qlszv/respiratory_effects_from_13_dimethylamylamine/,

In the quest to ""Keep It Simple, Stupid"", I've color coded my intake.  I try to have with each meal something green (kale, spinach, broccoli, collard greens, mustard greens), something red or yellow (onions or tomatoes), and once per day I'll have something blue and orange (berries and a grapefruit).  I'm restricting calories now, so in addition to being my only source of carbs, these fruits and vegetables are my only source of many micronutrients.  I also take a multi-vitamin (Opti-Men, at 1/2 to 1/3rd the recommended dosage), Vitamin D, and fish-oil on days I don't eat sardines or salmon.  I recently decided to evaluate my micro-nutrient intake and found that in a typical *meal* I was consuming 100% to 250% of my RDA of Vitamin A.  

I know that Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that is toxic at high doses, and the recommend tolerable upper limit is set at 10,000 IU's for someone my age and size.  I've also read that Vitamin A from plant sources isn't as bioavailable as Vitamin A from liver and from multi-vitamins, but I'm still worried.  Should I drop my multi-vitamin from my daily stack and keep pounding back the veggies, or should I scale back my rabbit-like behavior and keep supplementing with the vitamin?

Seemed like as good a place as any.

In any case, the 0-10 star rating doesn't reflect how I think about supplements, although I can see why it might make sorting them easy. The main issue is that it doesn't address negative effects at all - what if something increases fat loss but decreases muscle building for instance. Second is that the majority of categories will not apply to a given supplement, and giving it zero stars seems to imply something negative about it.

What I'd like to see is the rating per supplement-category narrowed down of this set of icons, more or less:

[/\\/\\]  - two green up arrows, strong positive effect

[/\\] - single green up arrow, weak positive effect

[--] - grey dash, imperceivable effect or doesn't apply

[\\/] - red down arrow, weak negative

[\\/\\/] - double red down arrow, strong negative

Other additions might be [/\\?] and [\\/?] for a 'maybe' positive or negative effect, and [*] for a ""oh god I'm dying"" effect (aka caution).

Another benefit would be that you could show more ratings in less space - ie. show 5 sets of user ratings at once instead of being limited to one or two. For sorting, you would probably just apply a numeric value to each one (+2, +1, 0, -1, -2) and average them, although there might be more clever ways to do it.

I live in Iceland and we have access to, probably, the highest grade fish oil on the planet. I buy it liquid in large bottles and I really like it. I started taking it on a whim and realized I felt a lot better and my skin much better as well. So I do not think it is just a placebo effect.

Now what I have realized is that I´m pretty sure I was pretty vitamin D deficient before I started taking it. The past years I actually go outside very rarely. I work inside. I train inside. I play inside. So not much sun time for me.

But my questions are these:

**1) How much fish oil is too much? I take a large swig of oil every day. Which probably amounts to 4-6 tablespoons. Which is many times the recommended dosage. Is this OK? I feel best when I take it in pretty large volumes. But I do not want over dose and cause toxicity. Specially since the liver oil is also very high in vitamin A.**

**2. Should I start taking vitamin D3 or something like that, along side with my fish oil? If so, what should I buy and how should I stack it?**

**3. What is the difference between Vitamin D3 and the Vitamin D in fish oil?**

**4. Do you also need sunlight or will Vitamin D supplementation sufficient?**

I got free bottle of Yok3d when I bought Jack3d at GNC.  I don't usually buy at GNC, but the price was right.

http://www.jack-3d.com/yok3d

I loved it. I took 3 Yok3d capsules 2 hours before my workout with a meal. About 30 minutes before my workout, I took 3 scoops of Jack3d as well.  With Jack3d alone, I've had good workouts with amazing energy and focus.

With the addition of Yok3d, I had an amazing pump.  I did chest today,and I could feel my pecs blowing up and engorged.  I did extra sets for all my exercises and I added 10-15 pounds per set above what I did last. Usually I can add maybe 2.5-5lbs to each end of the bar.  I was still able to do my HIIT cardio on the gauntlet/stairs (level 3 for 45 secs, level 16 for 45 secs - I think that counts as HIIT - for 15 minutes).

Weights today:

* Bench press - 135lbs  3x5
* Bench press - 155lbs 2x5
* Hammer strength seated chest press - (each side) 45lb 1x8,  55lb 1x8, 65lb 1x8, 80lb 1x8, 90lb 2x6
* Incline dumbbell - 50lb 2x8, 45lb 3x8
* push ups - 10x8
* HIIT cardio workout-20 minutes
* machine chest flyes (I did negatives with 100lb setting)

For boosting GH, it seems to make sense to either take it pre-workout or pre-bed, but at the same time it could be good pre-studying, so I'm really curious to hear some feedback on this.

If I dose an ECY stack (25mg / 200+mg / 7.5mg) every four hours or so, does it make sense to dose more yohimbine after two hours and ride the longer effects of the E and C? My goal is to maximize the fat-burning effects during my fasted period, and I kinda get obsessive about optimization and  efficiency. It would look something like this:
  
* **8:00 AM:** ECY (25mg / 200+mg / 7.5mg) + green tea  
  
* **10:00 AM:** Y (7.5mg) + green tea  
  
* **12:00 PM** ECY (25mg / 200mg / 7.5mg)",,False,,t5_2qhb8,False,,,True,t3_iger2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/iger2/yohimbine_half_life_and_dosing_frequency/,

I recently ordered some D-Aspartic Acid after reading [Silverhydra's post.](http://www.silverhydra.com/2011/05/d-aspartic-acid-and-the-secret-to-italian-loving/) (It was kind of a impulse purchase to be honest.)


My order is due to arive in a couple days and I just want to nail down a plan before it arrives.


So from what I've gathered, 3g a day is the recomended dosage and it should be stacked with an aromatase inhibitor.

***
I plan on taking 2g a day and combine it with the 26mg of zinc / day I already take.


I reduced the dosage to 2mg because:

* I'm not that big (5'10.5'', 170lbs., ~9% BF)
* I don't have some crazy aromatase inhibitor.

***

Questions:

* How was your experience with D-Aspartic Acid?
* Does my plan seem sensible?
* What kind of a cycle should I be looking at?


Thanks in advance,

ADC

This is my second post here, y'all were quite helpful the first time around. Before I jump the gun and get into the supplements I take, I'd like to preface this by explaining my goals, fitness routine and diet routine.

**My Goal:**

I am working towards losing Body Fat (I am currently about 13%-14%), and gain muscle mass/strength. In other words, I'm cutting and bulking. I feel with my fitness and diet and supplementation, I am doing it right.

**My Fitness:**


I do weight training 4 times a week targeting different muscle groups depending on the day. Every work out is continual for about an hour, I go for 5 supersets at 12 reps. Besides weight training, I do cardio about 5 times a week, usually a 1.5-4 mile run depending on how I'm feeling. I take three days in a row off weight training per week to focus on recovery. 


**My Diet:**

I am on a carb cycle comprised of 3 low-carb days and 1 high-carb days.
My BMR is around 1527 calories, and my TDEE is around 2634 calories. 

My calories, carbs, protein and fat consumed for both low and high days are:

*Low:* 1887.25 Cal, 134.91g, 210.81g, 57.225g

*High:* 2365.5 Cal, 297.5g, 194.05g, 58.35g

^do ^note ^this ^includes ^my ^protein ^shakes

Anyways, on to the good stuff!

***Supplements:***


**Mornings:**

* Synedrex *(Methylxanthine, Synephrine, Green tea extract, Sulbutiamine, R-β-Methylphenylethylamine, 1,3 Dymethylamylamine, Yohimbine, ALA, Sandalwood Oil, Poly-iiodo-Thyronine, Simmondsin, Meridextrine-this last one is trade marked)*

* Fish Oil 1.2g

* Multivitamin (upgrading to Ortho Core soon)

**Meal 2:**

* ON Gold Standard Whey Protein Shake


**Meal 4:**

* ON Gold Standard Whey Protein Shake


**Pre-Workout**

* Hyde (basically a shit ton of caffeine and 1,3 DMAA) I wonder if I even need this shit especially since the Synedrex has 1,3 DMAA.....

* 5g creatine monohydrate

* 3000 mg Betaine Nitrate (trimethylglycine NO3)

**During Workout:**

* Amino Acid Matrix 7.6g, **a.** BCAA (2:1:1) *L-Leucine:L-Valine:L-Isoleucine* **b.** SAA *L-Alanine, L-Glycine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Cystine, L-Tyrosine, L-Methionine, L-Lysine* **c.** *Taurine, Vit-C, Vit-E, Vit-A*

**Before Bed, low-carb days:**

* ON Gold Standard Casein 


So there you have it folks. I'm no chemist/biologist, so those amino acids were a pain in the ass to type lol.

Any comments, recommendations would be awesome. Lately I've been questioning the Hyde and amino acids: specifically, do I really need the Hyde and is there a better amino acid matrix I could be taking?

I understand that beta-alanine has no benefit in terms of workout energy but is it worth it to take it anyways, for the endurance benefits?

Is there anything else worth stacking with the caffeine? Also, any good and cheap flavoring I could get?

EDIT: This is my stack so far: 

- Caffeine 200mg

- L-Theanine 400mg

- Citrulline Malate 6g

- Beta-Alanine 2g (Should I do 4g?)

- Creatine Monohydrate 5g

- MiO for Flavoring (Alternatives please!)

Total cost is about $0.64 per serving, the two most expensive being the Citrulline and MiO. This is 15 cents cheaper than white flood reborn, the only pre workout I've used where you actually only need 1 serving. In addition, I know exactly whats in my PWO as opposed to some prop blend like in most pre workouts.

What I want is something relatively short-term (2-3 months at the outside, ideally) to help me burn off the last stubborn bit of noticeable body fat, then I'll see if my diet and exercise are sufficient to keep it off.

From other threads in this sub, the thing that seems most promising is to try an ECA Stack a while, followed by Yohimbine once the fat is gone and to help me taper off the ECA. Given what I've shared about myself, does that seem like a decent plan to the good folks of r/Supplements?

Thanks :)


*EDIT*: Because I've previously had prescribed stimulants, I'm now wondering: is there any real difference between, say, Adderall and an ECA Stack? From what I've read about that stack, it sounds basically like a ""weaker"" amphetamine.

Therefore:

* for +- four weeks I've been taking 200mg magnesium a day (was taking 300mg in the first week)
* for around two and a half week 800mg calcium a day
* three chamomile and lemon balm teas a day
* 1g of inositol for around one and a half week

Around a week ago, suddenly, I noticed a red mark like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/LMmThHH.jpg) on my calf and three elliptical red spots on my belly. I ignored it and today, a week after, none of them disappeared (or even became less apparent) and I also got three new, very small but still, red circles above my belly button. Therefore, it looks like some allergic reaction, right? None of these rash and all of them are smooth like the rest of the skin around them. The one on my calf sometimes seems redder, sometimes paler but it doesn't look like it's going anywhere.

I had blood tests a month ago and everything was fine. I also don't think calcium is the culprit since:

a) I experience muscle fasciculations which...

b) ...are more than likely connected to my low calcium levels since I took a D3 vitamin tests and I have 18ng/ml so quite a good deficit (started supplementing it two days ago)

Any ideas? If I were to find something which was the closest in time to these spots, I'd say inositol - there were maybe 2-3 days between taking the first pills of it and showing up of these spots. Everywhere I read, though, it seemed inositol has practically no adverse effects...
