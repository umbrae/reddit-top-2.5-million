Why are you ignoring this?",162,35,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1guiav/we_have_analyzed_tor_hidden_services_and_shown/,"I have already mentioned this a number of times. The paper has also been posted both in /r/Tor and here. I feel as though a large part of this community is either ignorant of this or is downplaying it. This is from an academic paper. Those guys don't usually make baseless claims and it would be very much in the interest of your community to pay attention to what they have shown.

From another post of mine:

In fact, Tor hidden services are in dire need of a revamp, because right now, they are unsafe ,as shown by [this paper](http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a080.pdf), which was published about a month ago. I am still a bit baffled as to why this isn't given much more attention in this subreddit. I consider it required reading for everyone in here.

Here's what it boils down to:

&gt;IX. Conclusion

&gt;**We have analyzed the security properties of Tor hidden services and shown that attacks to deanonymize hidden services at a large scale are practically possible with only a moderate amount of resources. We have demonstrated that collecting the descriptors of all Tor hidden services is possible in approximately 2 days by spending less than USD 100 in Amazon EC2 resources. Running one or more guard nodes then allows an attacker to correlate hidden services to IP addresses using a primitive traffic analysis attack.** Furthermore, we have shown that attackers can impact the availability and sample the popularity of arbitrary hidden services not under their control by selectively becoming their hidden service directories.

&gt;To address these vulnerabilities we have proposed countermeasures. These prevent hidden service directories from learning the content of any the descriptors unless they also know their corresponding onion address and significantly increase the resources required to selectively become a hidden service directory for a targeted hidden service.

&gt;However, note that the above suggestions are nothing more than stop-gap measures. We believe that the problems we have shown are grave enough to warrant a careful redesign of Tor’s hidden services.",,False,self,t5_2r552,False,,,True,t3_1guiav,http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1guiav/we_have_analyzed_tor_hidden_services_and_shown/,
1370242924.0,120,self.onions,1fkgti,"PSA: Do not use TorShops, EuCanna, Peoples Drug Store or EasyCoin wallet.",138,18,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1fkgti/psa_do_not_use_torshops_eucanna_peoples_drug/,"Figured I should lay some good ol' Tor justice smackdown on whoever this is. If you don't want to get into the juicy details just read the title and store it in your brain for future reference. This entire thing really fucking rustled my jimmies and I'm going to get it out there.

Earlier I received an e-mail from someone frantically encouraging me to take down TorShops off the Cleaned Hidden Wiki. They alleged that the vendor stole $500 from them and that he'd actually faked a ton of feedback across various sites and even came up with elaborate forums/communities as a part of the operation. I get these e-mails once a week - occasionally from a legit scam, occasionally from a competing vendor trying to tarnish another vendor's reputation. The entire thing seemed really far-fetched and complex and didn't scream ""scam"" by any measures to me. That's usually the most dangerous kind of scam though; the one that looks like it could easily pass as any legitimate marketplace and doesn't cause a second glance.

However, I decided to investigate. I remember this vendor sending me an e-mail a while back, so I cracked open TrueCrypt, searched around a bit for archived e-mails (I occasionally keep them when someone asks me to add something to CHW - can become useful in events like these), and finally found it. He'd asked me to add 3 different links to CHW - [EuCanna](http://rso4hutlefirefqp.onion/), [EasyCoin](http://easycoinsayj7p5l.onion), and the actual [TorShops](http://shopsat2dotfotbs.onion/) site. This maybe should've sent alarm bells ringing (this wide of a variety of products is rare unless you have a whole team working on it). I thought nothing of it, the sites looked pretty fancied up and it likely took effort to build them so I didn't worry about it too much.

Fast forward a bit, I see TorShops advertising on reddit. Not odd at all, some reasonable site operators advertise here when they want to get the word out about a service.

Fast forward to today. I check out EasyCoin. I notice the banner at the top of the page - it advertises the clearnet URL and .onion URL. I check out the [clearnet site](http://easycoin.net). 

This is what sent me for a loop. The banner at the top didn't include any .onion address. In fact, I found no sign of an .onion counterpart at all on the entire site. This happens with scams all the time. I remember a Bitcoin laundry that blatantly ripped off part of Fog's descriptions and a clearnet site's interface.

The reason why I included Peoples Drug Store. [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1a10fo/torshops_create_your_own_onion_store_with_full/). Site located at [this](http://newpdsuslmzqazvr.onion/) URL.

All of these drug sites include escrow. The escrow is provided by the drug sites. All of these sites appear custom-made except for EasyCoin (which is where this scam artist dun fuck'd up).

Moral of the story: Trust *NO ONE* in Onionland. Never go by appearances alone. Use a guaranteed third party escrow that isn't affiliated with the vendor. Make reviews regarding vendors in [Evil|Wiki's Reviews page](http://wvk32thojln4gpp4.onion/wiki/index.php/Reviews). Always warn others if you come across a scam.

Q: Is encrypting my email any good at defeating the NSA surveillance? Is my data protected by standard encryption?

A: Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it.

How do you interpret the answer?

I just wanted to remind you that TOR hides your IP, but it doesn't make you untraceable.  There are many other things that could be used to find out who you are (spelling/wording/typos, date/time; the user-agent string of your browser or other identifiers of a software you are using, user names, passwords, email addresses and everything else that could be associated with your real identity).  
 


**Background**: I managed to identify a (misbehaving) TOR user based on other patterns like 2 months ago.  I'm not really trying to hide my identity, but if I wanted to do that I would use completely different programs, user names and services to create a 'new identity' (as good as possible).  


There are some very experienced TOR users in this subreddit, but I think there are more people who are not really careful when using it.  In most cases nobody will try to find out who you are, but if you're only hiding your IP address then you don't really need TOR unless you just want to visit a hidden service.  Of course, if many people changed their behaviour it would be very difficult to find a single person.

About a month or two ago, the 'Admin' stepped in and put a 30 day protection on the main page of the hidden wiki as a curb against vandalism, a captcha was installed and he promptly disappeared never to be heard from again. I'm not sure whether this was intentional or whether the Administrator has just forgotten about the Hidden Wiki, it doesn't matter so much now. 

Since the Administrator left the edit wars started off slowly, a few links deleted here or there, some users got irate, eventually that persistance and the Hidden Wiki's dominance laid the foundations for a small market of those that would sit there for hours on end replacing links and combating spammers. Of course, the otherside then grew to like this technique too and the Edit Wars spiralled. 

Over the last week or so we have seen the culmination of this where one, rather cunning entrepreneur decided to create a bot that could ease its way through the Captcha and do all of that hard work for him without needing to spend a penny, in revenge for his site constantly being removed by 'do gooders'. 

A while back if one would care to check the history, the Hidden Wiki was there to list ALL hidden services, regardless of what they actually were, including blank pages, including hello world pages. Some users thought that scams and phishing attempts shouldn't be listed which was in effect the start of the war. 

This war against the bot has escalated into the other side also using a bot (apparently) and so the Hidden Wiki has effectively been crippled by a Sandbox scenario. I think this teaches us something important about Human behaviour. 

Humans, will always try to do what they think is right, even at the expense of the resource itself. If one side doesn't back down, then the whole reason why the two sides were fighting in the first place will be destroyed and returned to dust. It's clear from this 'simulation' that some framework or structure of authority is required in order to ensure some sense of fair play, especially if trying to protect or rather preserve a resource. 

It goes to show that true liberty cannot exist without the rule of law. I would also caution that law should only be there to organize and make society more efficient rather than being there to follow the whim of whoever holds the majority at the time. This sounds contradictory, but unfortunately true Anarchism leads to true destruction of everything around us. 

In the mean time, if everyone would like to start using the Cleaned Wiki or The Evil Wiki, I'm sure the respective owners would appreciate it and hope that such an event can be avoided in the future.

1. **What happened?**
The biggest hosting service for hidden services (onions) got caught. FBI took down his servers, inserted a JavaScript exploit to unmask visitors and put them on-line again. 

2. **Does this mean Tor/Silk Road/Insert hidden service is not safe anymore?**
Not necessarily. Until we know how he was caught we do not know if this method could be used against other services and/or users.

3. **I heard he was caught by Java exploit which backtracked him?**
No. As far as we know the owner of Freedom Hosting did NOT get caught BECAUSE OF the JavaSCRIPT exploit but the FBI (or someone else) inserted it to all Freedom Hosting websites AFTER they caught him to catch visitors of websites hosted on his servers.

4. **I am on Windows, should I be worried?**
Possibly. Yes if you visited a FH website last week using a version Tor Browser Bundle BEFORE v0.2.3.25-10 OR with a Firefox version before 17.0.7 WITHOUT disabling all scripts.

5. **I am on Linux/Mac/Tails/Newest TBB. Should I be worried?**
Most likely no.

6. **Is this good or bad?**
Depends. He did not only host arguably terrible material but also many useful legal services. Services which could have been used in country's with oppressive regimes. He is not a ""CP host"" like the media tells you but a host without rules on which people from around the world hosted all kinds of websites. I hate CP but true freedom is also for things you hate the most.
FBI exploit is bad because it will catch lots of innocent people.

7. **Now what.**
Use Tails if you can. ALWAYS DISABLE SCRIPTS.

8. **OMG I PLACED WEED SR ORDER HOW MANY TIMES SHOULD I FORMAT???**
Over 9000.


Interesting facts: 

+ FH owner started a new service called ""Onion Bank"" days before the take down. My guess is he screwed up.
+ The owner of FH was the owner of Tormail.org, suspected to be owned by Russians.
+ FH did not only host CP. Legal services (like Tormail) are hosted on FH. FBI exploit is on these legal websites too.

[This link](http://drwho.virtadpt.net/archive/2007/02/09/college-professor-asked-to-stop-using-and-teaching-tor) featured a professor who used TOR in a computer science class. He later received a call from the IT department of his university claiming that he was one of only two TOR users on campus, and one of them was doing something illegal.

~~I'll go ahead and admit right now that I've never run a hidden service before, nor have I had any experience running a clone of Reddit.~~

~~/r/onions isn't tiny in numbers, so maybe with some interest we can make ReddiTOR a neat corner of onionland to hang out in. *ReddiTOR is NOT intended for illegal content, so I take no responsibility if you do choose to post it.* I'd love any suggestions on how to run/improve the site. Right now it's effectively a naked babby Reddit over there (0 subs), so what do you say we get started making some cool onioney subreddits?~~

~~Also, I just want to say that if [TorRedditTor](/u/torreddittor) ever shows up again, I'll be more than glad to hand everything back over to him (:~~

 
~~**\*EDIT**: There's a lot of heated debate about allowing CP, or JB, or any amount of other illegal content. In my mind, I believe that the entire premise of the darknet is that no one has the authority to tell someone else what's right or wrong. However, as Reddit--and by extension ReddiTOR--is a community-driven system, I'll make damn sure that people aren't being made to see things they don't willingly want to see. If you've made a subreddit, **please be clear in your sidebar about what is or isn't allowed on your sub**. Delete anything that violates your rules, and ban offenders from your sub. Don't want CP? Great. Put it on your sidebar under RULES and I'll subscribe to your sub and help you kick out unwanted content. Don't want illegal transactions being solicited on your subreddit? Fantastic. Put it on your rules and get moderating. I'll help you out. Don't want pictures of wildlife on your sub? Weird, but fine! Make sure it's an official rule and stamp it out of your little corner of ReddiTOR. I probably won't bother helping you. The point is, the reddit model is that you choose what you want to see, discuss, and post. So do it! I do NOT want to be imposing my morality on any of you. In onionland, no one's got that right.~~

~~As an admin, the most I'll do is ensure that sensitive content is NOT included in the default. As far as I'm concerned, If no one's allowed to limit what others can see, no one's allowed to force others to see things they don't want to.~~

~~**As a side note**, anyone *should* be able to create a subreddit by going to gmyzy5exjw4pimvf.onion/reddits/create  
As stated above, PLEASE be clear with the rules for your sub, and vigilant in your moderation of it.~~

Of course even if they can get your traffic, due to the routing nodes they wouldn't know who it was coming from - unless they made the use of Tor (providing even internal nodes) an offence (facilitating crime? aiding and abetting?). And so long as you use decent encryption your traffic should be safe as well, although actually perhaps not, as the authorities could easily bend the certification authorities to their will and then act as a man in the middle on the exit nodes, impersonating the public key of the intended destination.

The 'web of trust' approach (used by PGP?) could work there though I guess as then even if the web is compromised only a few people's communications would be vulnerable rather than everyones.

Also what if the real tin-foil hat types are right and the NSA etc. can break RSA/ElGamal anyway then are we pretty much screwed?

server source code is on [github](https://github.com/majestrate/nameless-ircd)

the network is at irc://smt4wjpa3r7tkczs.onion/

additional server added: irc://ad52wtwp2goynr3a.onion/

i also made a [python script](http://smt4wjpa3r7tkczs.onion/easy.py) that makes irc with onions a lot easier

I've found:

[Liberte Linux](http://dee.su/liberte)
and 
[Tail's Linux](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html)

Both are built with anonymity in mind. Any other recommended linux versions? Are those secure? it seems like linux advertising anonymity would be a target for breaching access.. 

I've read a bit about backdoors in chips. How reasonable is it to believe that 'they' have access to something like my network card and regardless of the OS I install, I can still be accessed?

I've got access to a ton of machines: old win2000, new server 2012 - would any of these fair any better, as far as potential for breach? Would I be better building an old machine with obscure parts, and using that to run that linux, maybe behind a firewall?

On firewalls - if I were to put a sonicwall or similar into play, it seems like it's possible they too could be compromised. Is that possible? Is there a better solution than a firewall appliance as far as locking down communication?

On Wan/WLAN - should I assume they can intercept my modem's communications and go straight for a VPN? Is there a better or necessary encryption over wpa2?

**edit:** I found this: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-focused_operating_system

Which references this under the header discription of Linux OS':

&gt;The Linux kernel itself has a module, specifically Linux Security Module(LSM), called Security-Enhanced Linux(SELinux) that has enjoyed official integration status with the mainline Linux kernel since 2003. Despite the initial objections of Linus Torvalds, the kernels gatekeeper, the NSA eventually got him to accept their proposal to integrate SELinux

People recommending linux distros, does that not concern you? The main alternative is BSD and there's a bunch of other OS on that wiki page. But I still wonder how probable it's all been compromised.

I believe in a free and open internet where information is easily obtained and people can safely and anonymously express themselves if they choose.  It's something I feel very strongly about. These feelings have lead me to wonder two things as I browse onionland:

A) Is there a charity that sends flashdrives and/or DVDs with the software needed to bypass firewalls in oppressed countries? If so, I'd like to help.

Like a lot of you, I've been playing around with the [Tor security guide](http://pastebin.com/6EGZm25G) that was posted recently and wasn't having much luck.

Every time I would get to the end of the guide, the final commands would not work, I'd get error messages in Terminal, and my network connection would continuously time out.

After spending endless hours troubleshooting I think I've finally got it sorted, so I just thought I'd post this up in case it can help out anyone else who's currently in the same predicament that I was in.



First up:

* This method has been tested on Windows 7 only - you may be able to tweak the guide for XP, but I have not tested it.

* It is assumed that your intention is to browse using Tor network solely inside your Ubuntu VM (and not on your main PC).

* For this guide you **MUST** use Ubuntu 11.10 as your VM OS -***not*** Ubuntu 10.10 [(ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso)](http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=desktop&amp;bits=32&amp;release=latest)

* I allocated my DSL Firewall VM 128MB RAM, rather than the 32MB suggested in the guide. Technically, this should not make any difference, but I thought it was worth mentioning just in case.

* None of the **optional** steps in the original guide were followed (ie installing IRC &amp; Torchat).

* Aside from the changes I've listed in this tutorial, the rest of the original guide should be followed pretty much exactly as written.

* Even if you have already performed the original guide multiple times, I would still highly recommend reading through these instructions just to get the overall gist, then starting anew with a completely fresh setup using the original guide combined with these alterations.

----------

Ok, so here is what worked for me:


**1 : Obtaining Tor Browser**


Instead of installing the Tor Browser Bundle, download and install the Vidalia Bundle from [here](https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia-bundles/vidalia-bundle-0.2.2.35-0.2.17.exe).




* Once it's downloaded, run the installer and select your language.

* Hit 'Next', then ***uncheck*** 'Torbutton 1.4.5' on the list *(you only want to install Vidalia, Tor and Polipo)*

* Hit 'Next', then 'Install' - the installation will run.

* Once the installer finishes hit 'Next' then 'Finish'

The Vidalia Control Panel should pop up and after a while you'll get the message 'Connected to the Tor network!'

Hit 'Hide' and continue on with **'Section 3 : Securing Your Harddrive'** in the original guide.


**11 : Installing Ubuntu**

***Installing the VirtualBox Guest Additions***
 
When you're at the end of **'Section 11. Installing Ubuntu'** in the original guide (just after you've recorded your encryption passphrase) perform the following steps:

* Up in the top right corner you should see a little icon that's a picture of some green hardware with a lock - click it and select 'Install Drivers' from the dropdown box.

* An 'Additional Drivers' box should pop up with some text that mentions 'x86 virtualization solution - guest addition module source for dkms'

* Click 'Activate' in the lower right corner, enter your password and click 'Authenticate'.

The VirtualBox Guest Additions will now download and install.
Once it's finished, there should be a green icon in the lower left of the window next to 'This driver is activated and currently in use.'

* Click 'Close', and continue on with **'Section 12 : Ubuntu Initial Setup'** in the original guide.




* ****&gt;&gt;&gt; As you have already installed the Guest Additions using an alternative method, you can skip 'Section 13: Installing Guest Additions' in the original guide &lt;&lt;&lt;**** *
----------

* ****&gt;&gt;&gt; I also skipped Sections 14 &amp; 15 and did not install IRC or Torchat &lt;&lt;&lt;**** *
----------

**16 : Creating TOR-Only Internet Environment**

Once you have completed **Step 20** in the original guide (finished configuring Firefox to use Tor), do the following in Ubuntu 11.10:

* Click on the Wireless Radio icon that's over to the right up in the top menu bar, and select 'Edit Connections'

* Your default connection should be named something like 'Wired connection 1' - click on it, and select 'Edit' on the right.
* ***Uncheck*** the box next to 'Connect Automatically' and hit 'Save', then Close the first window.

You've almost finished! Now return to the original guide and continue on from **Step 21** - hopefully this time you will get a connection when you perform the final steps!

----------
So that's it - I hope this guide can help some of you out. I'm really just a n00b at all this, but if you run into any problems, let me know and I'll do what I can to help out.

Also, it would be really great if someone could confirm as to whether or not they were also able to have any success by using the method outlined above.

I checked out the cleaned wiki, the links on the sidebar of /r/onions and didn't find anything interesting. Even the tor version of reddit was dead. Is it that there is no need to use tor in the free world to exchange political ideas and one is free to state and defend his political views? 
Or are those who could really benefit from tor not from free countries but from ones where stating your political views openly can be harmful? 
Is there a good site on tor about politics that is significantly better than the ones on the surface web? 





The other thing I wanted to ask about were the tor sites by revolutionaries. It is unrealistic to expect them to be openly accessible and in English, so I wanted to know if they are real and if tor has really benefited revolutions. 


And finally, what information can you find on tor that is not available on the surface web? What do you use it for? 


PS I used tor browser quite a while ago (probably more than 6 months) and am not tech savvy in any way, so I hope I haven't annoyed anyone  with this completely layman post and what might be considered stupid questions. I tried using the reddit search engine but didn't find anything on the subject.

The service consist of something like:
User --&gt; .onion --&gt; Tor --&gt; Service  --&gt; Tor --&gt; Normal IP:Port

(Basically you enter a .onion address in the tor browser and that gets routed to an IP:Port that you previously specified)

Of course this has a fee (small), bandwidth isn't free. Do you get the point? Would you be interested in buying something like this?
[The implementation of this one is almost finished]

2) Another service i'm thinking to implement is a VPS service with tor integrated in ""low level"" layers, so you will receive your root access, login via ssh to an .onion address, get # and finally do ""apt-get update"" and everything fully anonymous. Nobody (nor you) will ever know where the server is hosted and you will get all the feeling of a normal vps. The downside is that only TCP traffic will work out of the box, but you can setup a VPN to fix this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           3) Vanity address generation (.onion, bitcoin addr, etc) for a fee.

4) PHP+MySQL webhosting. Free small accounts and paid upgrades.

5) Long term backup service. You pay months/years plans and i store your data in a safe place in some points of the world. Then when you need it you just download it the same as you stored it.

6) I'm open to ideas.

I want to run a service based on tor so i'm collecting my own ideas and i'm also open to suggestions/requests. I have far more the required technical knowledge to run any of the services described above and i'm sure that i will be capable to run any suggestion too.

I'll start:

For instance, when people post links to the ""clearweb"" on .onion sites they always warn people, and I've never understood why. Is this because of accessing clearweb sites over Tor makes you increasingly vulnerable to ""rogue"" exit nodes? (if so, what is the exact danger here- can they pinpoint your traffic back to you?) Or is it because of man in the middle attacks? (If so, what is the specific danger here?)

Additionally, what is everyone's best practices regarding scripts. I've always just universally blocked all scripts but sites like reddit require scripts for quite basic functions. Is allowing scripts on clearnet sites dangerous?

I'm more than happy to read linked articles, but answers to these specific questions one way or another would be greatly appreciated.

Groups are incredibly useful - they're basically small forums that only you and whoever you invite can see.

I think there should be a Tor site that lets you create an account and talk with other people anonymously. You would register with a username, then you could create multiple aliases.

Then you could create a discussion group, inviting as many people as you want by their aliases. In the group, people could make and comment on threads. Only people invited to the group could see what's being talked about.
This would allow us to create discussion groups that aren't monitored by facebook or whoever else. They also wouldn't be as instant as IRC, so you could go back and comment later.

Honestly this is something I'd like to code myself but can't figure out where I'd start to learn

Edit: When you log into your account, perhaps you can see updates to all discussions you're participating in 

Edit2: perhaps aliases are unique to groups

I cancelled service with them, and am trying to find a more TOR friendly ISP.


Anyway: Please be respectful. TOR is not designed for torrenting, and you stand to screw over honest, generous people if you do.

UPDATE:
Spoke with a new ISP (Socket), and they're fine with me running an exit node on a dedicated IP. Looks like not-being-a-dick just earned them a new customer.",,False,self,t5_2r552,True,,,True,t3_pyduw,http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/pyduw/please_be_respectful_how_dmca_notices_screwed_me/,

Let's try set a new onionland standard....it's the first onion file-share site to incorporate: 

* Chat
* Account management: mass delete, account privacy, friends list
* Community moderation: Vote down accounts which the community sees as bad for business
* Browse: From the left menu, click links to view - latest 50 uploads, latest 50 galleries/accounts.

**Features**

* Simplicity: No usernames, no passwords. Just bookmark your account page (1-click account creation)
* Encryption: Raw files don't touch the hard-disc. Data encrypted on-the-fly as you upload. Not even a temporary file is used. Database text is encrypted before written.
* Sharing: browse each others uploads, and set the profile name to indicate content.
* Freedom: Your account, your rules
* Chat: basic chat board (think late 90's style)
* No scripts: the site is light weight and has no images or java scripts to serve the pure HTML.There is a CSS script.
* Dynamic: upvote and downvote entire accounts into oblivion (Feedback on this feature please)
* Privacy: Account status can be set to private or public
* Flexibility: Nominate which members can see your profile / files


**To-do**

* Messaging: Private messaging, or per account comments box.
* Security: Locate and address security concerns. Community feedback requested!
* Load test: the site has yet to serve multiple simultaneous clients. 
* Client-side encryption: For private accounts only. If there is demand then this should be implemented too.

* **who built it?** - Just me! For now its a one-person show folks.

[Edit 3]

**Important**: If your files are not to be snooped at  then client side manual encryption is a must. This foremost is a file-sharing site with the emphasis being in sharing. The 256AES encryption on this site is implemented as a safety net for everyone as a community and especially the admins if there server lost/stolen etc.

The ""Browse"" and ""Recent 50"" button on the left menu show your account and files, unless you set your account to private. 

**To-Do**:

 What feature do you want to see in a file sharing website on Tor?

[Edit March 9] 
Update: Database isn't great with simultaneous users online. I assume its poor coding from me. This means soon all the files will be wiped and new database install.

I made a comment about how to do it... realized it'd be better up here... and deleted the comment. :)

So anyway, you can update to 0.2.3.10-alpha (Tor's current) with these bleeding-edge experimental instructions...

1 - open a root terminal (or ""su"", password amnesia)

2 - enter this command exactly: 

echo ""deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/ tor-0.2.3.x-squeeze main"" &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list 

3 - apt-get update

4 - apt-get install tor=0.2.3.10-alpha-1~~squeeze+1

Note: always check [here](http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/dists/tor-0.2.3.x-squeeze/main/binary-i386/Packages) first to verify the correct and current version string

5 - run ""service tor start"" to (re)start Tor and confirm correct version

6 - when updates are complete, exit Vidalia (right click on the onion icon at top-right)

7 - (re)launch Vidalia (Applications -&gt; Internet -&gt; Vidalia).

When your onion goes from yellow to green, PROFIT!

You should also confirm the correct running version in the root terminal. You should also get this notice: ""[notice] This version is not a stable Tor release. Expect more bugs than usual."" This is the whole bleeding-edge part I mentioned earlier.

Also: ""Tails Is Amnesiac"" so you have to do this on every boot of it.",,False,self,t5_2r552,True,,,True,t3_nn4gl,http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/nn4gl/quick_reminder_that_tors_been_updated_but_tails/,

Well, I heard about it back a while ago, but it seems like the whole tor/darknet things has gotten bigger.

I downloaded the Tor browser from Torproject.org via this link:

https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en

I turned it on for a bit to see if it worked and it did, turned it back off again later and didn't really explore much.

However, I have two big questions related to security and using it anonymously.

First, I will be downloading tails to prevent anything from being saved on my computer (I believe that is what it is called).  I just have to go out and get a burnable DVD sometime to run it.  Is that basically enough to prevent anything from being saved on my computer?  

Second, is there anything else I would need to do to prevent my ""identity"" from being leaked onto there?  AKA, is using the tor browser enough?  Would somehow stuff from my computer via flash or other things somehow ""leak"" onto that browser and reveal my real ""identity""?  Or is the browser set up to prevent that?

Last, how do I stop my computer from being a ""nod"".  AKA, how can I set it up so that I am just a user and not on the ""end"" of a request?  From my understanding, at some point a computer is randomly selected to being the one retrieving the request for another user.  How can I prevent that from happening?  How can I just be a user and NEVER be at the end of a request or a ""nod""?

Hopefully all that makes since.  I did some searching on here and also saw a big post about how to use it.  But I really didn't feel like any of the above was made 100% clear.

Anyways, thanks for any information.

I will admit I was not truly around to experience the actual Onion Forums. From what I heard, it was fun and respectable but the owner silently shut it down (like the owner killed it silently)

I recently checked out Onion 2.0 and well... it sucks. There is only 1 place called ""Talk, Talk, Talk"" and the mods + admin is never on.

I want to start another forum, maybe called Onion 3.0 but im actually going to dedicate time to it. Ive ran 3 small forums in the past and I feel like I can handle this one BUT I NEED YOUR IDEAS.

The forum will almost look like most forums where there are topics and you can discuss in these topics. I, the Admin, will moderate and make sure the forum is okay. The only rule I have in mind is no CP discussion but that could change (In my opinion, im strongly against CP but I understand there are those who are not and I must respect them but Ill see)

Tell me, WHAT MADE THE FIRST ONION FORUM GREAT!? Dont hesitate to comment anything. Im up for it! If there is anything private you want to suggest, please feel free to email me at ""idea1015@tormail.org""

I am having trouble finding a clear source explaining exactly what goes on behind the scenes.  Someone directed me to https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/path-spec.txt, but it didn't really answer my questions.  Wikipedia states:

“To create and transmit an onion, the following steps are taken:

1. The sender picks nodes from a list provided by a special node called the directory node (traffic between the sender and the directory node may also be encrypted or otherwise anonymised or decentralised); the chosen nodes are ordered to provide a path through which the message may be transmitted; this ordering of the nodes is called a chain or a circuit.”

Does this mean that onion routing is a dial-on-demand circuit, like an ATM SVC?  Let's say for example I want to web browse to www.google.com.  Where does my DNS request go?  Does my TOR web client ask the directory node(s) to build a VC to the IP address of google?  Does this happen for every new request I send?  How is the exit node chosen?  Is it geographically close to the destination IP address of my packets, or is it a random place in the Internet?  What does a packet capture look like of an onion routed packet?  I'm assuming it uses TCP for transport, correct?  If so, what port numbers does it use?  Does packet fragmentation become a problem based on the number of intermediary nodes in the onion network?

Is this still something people would make use of, if it existed?

If so, I'd be grateful if you'd answer the following:

* The most important features are obviously security, anonymity, reliability. Those are a given though, so what 'cool' features would you most like to see, as a user?
* This will be free, largely, because Tor should be available to all. However, funding, while there, is not infinite, and its unlikely I can provide free hosting to everyone that wants it without sacrificing quality. What would be, in your opinion, the least objectionable way to offset this? My current thinking is that free accounts would be in a first come first serve queue, with the ability to pay BTC to queue jump, but I thought some people may not like this. I refuse to do invite-only, as it goes against my view of what the service should be.
* My current TOS in my head is 'no child pornography'. That's about all I care about. Can anyone think of anything else I should care about? (Suggestions will probably mostly be ignored, but don't take it personally, I wouldn't ask if I didnt care).

In Temporary Autonomous Zones, Hakim Bey poses this criticism of cyber utopianists:

&gt;Let's say that for both political and personal reasons I desire good food, better than I can obtain from Capitalism-- unpolluted food still blessed with strong and natural flavors. To complicate the game imagine that the food I crave is illegal--raw milk perhaps, or the exquisite Cuban fruit mamey, which cannot be imported fresh into the U.S. because its seed is hallucinogenic (or so I'm told). I am not a farmer. Let's pretend I'm an importer of rare perfumes and aphrodisiacs, and sharpen the play by assuming most of my stock is also illegal. Or maybe I only want to trade word processing services for organic turnips, but refuse to report the transaction to the IRS (as required by law, believe it or not). Or maybe I want to meet other humans for consensual but illegal acts of mutual pleasure (this has actually been tried, but all the hard-sex BBSs have been busted--and what use is an underground with lousy security?). In short, assume that I'm fed up with mere information, the ghost in the machine. According to you, computers should already be quite capable of facilitating my desires for food, drugs, sex, tax evasion. So what's the matter? Why isn't it happening?

&gt; Why is NoScript configured to allow JavaScript by default in the Tor Browser Bundle? Isn't that unsafe?

&gt; We configure NoScript to allow JavaScript by default in the Tor Browser Bundle because many websites will not work with JavaScript disabled. Most users would give up on Tor entirely if a website they want to use requires JavaScript, because they would not know how to allow a website to use JavaScript (or that enabling JavaScript might make a website work).

&gt; I'm an expert! (No, really!) Can I configure NoScript to block JavaScript by default?

&gt; You can configure your copies of Tor Browser Bundle however you want to. However, we recommend that even users who know how to use NoScript leave JavaScript enabled if possible, because a website or exit node can easily distinguish users who disable JavaScript from users who use Tor Browser bundle with its default settings (thus users who disable JavaScript are less anonymous).

&gt; Disabling JavaScript by default, then allowing a few websites to run scripts, is especially bad for your anonymity: the set of websites which you allow to run scripts is very likely to uniquely identify your browser.

What happens is, I open the Tor browser folder, click on ""Start Tor browser,"" and, rather than the Vidalia control box popping up, nothing happens. Then, if I try to close the folder, open the task manager, ctrl+alt+del, or anything else, it just won't happen.

* Firefox, privoxy, tor, and all essential system services running in a secure sandbox. The sandbox is provided by a Linux kernel level [mandatory access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control) implementation known as [Tomoyo](http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/index.html.en). This sandbox protects against exploits, both known and unknown by restricting programs to only predetermined behaviors. It also prevents clear net access by denying tor clients (i.e. Firefox) network access to anything other than the Tor network.

* Firefox browser profile stored in an AES encrypted kernel-level stacked filesystem ([eCryptfs](http://ecryptfs.org/)).

* Firefox configured to disable JavaScript, Flash, and Java via the [QuickJava](http://quickjavaplugin.blogspot.com/) plugin. (Note that finer grained access control policies could negate the effects of external programs running in-browser though, so you could theoretically use a feature full Firefox in a tight sandbox!).

Seeing as they surely don't have my private or public key, it would remain encrypted? And vise versa, if I was sent an encrypted message from someone, how would I be able to read it?

I can't get my head around it. If the ultimate in encryption is using a one time pad - where the key is known only to you and the recipient (and only used once) - how do public keys fit in to the picture with PGP so that you don't need to use a one time pad?

I've disabled every Windows feature as none of them seemed necessary, and uninstalled everything from Add/Remove that doesn't seem required.  This includes .NET (I don't need this framework to run the tor browser, correct?).  What about Java - Would I need that for a VM that's solely being used to run the TOR browser?

Any other suggestions to strip this VM?  I'm going to try to shrink the size of it after everything's stripped away... might require a bit of hacking since VMWare hates small VMs.  But I'll figure that out after this is set.

Payable via Bitcoin, the price is 250 USD / month for a server with:

- No setup fee

- 1 dedicated CPU core

- 4 GB RAM

- 200 GB HDD (optional +15 USD for +500 GB, up to 6 TB total)

- 5 .onion addresses

- operating system of your choice (I recommend CentOS or Debian, but be my guest and run Windows 95 if that tickles your fancy)

- custom services may be free or may have a price (ask!), free tutorial on how to connect and manage the server, and using basic Linux shell commands, setting up web applications (may cost if it needs a lot of time)

- no logging, strong privacy laws

- optional +150 USD/month for each +1 core +4 GB RAM +10 .onion addresses, up to 4 cores and 16 GB RAM (if you get all 4 cores, you get free +4 GB RAM and unlimited .onion addresses)

All connections go through the Tor network and they are routed so the physical hardware is impossible to locate even if someone tries to shut down half of the Internet (lol). You will receive basic tech lessons on how to connect to the server through Tor and use basic services. There is no way in or out of the servers except through Tor.

Payable only via Bitcoin. At the time of this writing, 250 USD ~ 3 BTC. **All prices are negotiable.** Server can be upgraded at any time. If more people join or you order more CPU cores, the price will drop significantly for everybody, especially for older users.

**edit2** I will need orders for at least 2 CPU cores before I start this (it can be 1 user requesting 2 cores or 2 users requesting 1 core each). Seriously, I won't bother for a 1 person for 1 core. The hardware is in place and ready for a few dozen users (dozens of cores).

If a lot of people join in, I can set it up so you may share cores (only if you wish) to drop the price for the people sharing the same cores.

1. A cool (non US based ) domain. I am feeling something like ""MrAwesome@Ghostmail.sx"" .sx is what The pirate bay uses, I figure if it's good enough for them its good enough for us It's out of 'Merica's hands so that's something.

2. Make it compatible with TOR.

3. Make it functional and good nice to look at. Why do all encrypted email services have to look like 1995?

4. Features, I think it should have features comparable to G-mail or Outlook

5. End to end encryption. 

6. Self Destruct feature. All email sent to unsecured email addresses like Gmail, Yahoo, outlook etc. can get a self destruct feature so it deletes itself within a certain amount of time or after the email is read. It must also contain the words ""This message will self destruct"" 

7. Temporary accounts and/or aliases for those one time emails. 

8. The company has no owner. It is owned by the people. I am not sure exactly how to do this, but I think it would be awesome. That way there is no one for FeeBeeI or NeeSeeA or DoHoSsa can come after any one person because there is no one owner or provider. WE pay for the hosting/server/domain with the kickstarter funding.

9. A developer to take our hard earned Kickstarter loot. 

10. Someone to make a nifty, video to put on Kickstarter to sell the idea. 

11. IOS and Android support. 

12...  Public elections to pick the caretakers. The potential caretakers should submit an application and a Resume to say the top backers who will then go through them all and choose say 5 - 10 people who will sign an agreement to take care of the website, that they represent the users etc. Imagine it, a democratically owned and operated email service completely out of the hands of any and all governments. Built for the user and owned by the users. 

What do you guys think? I think we can do all this for under 20K and do it in a really professional way. If we can get 5K backers that runs USD $4.00 each.

I have been looking at the deepweb recently, and I highly suspect the existence of a very big network of scam website, probably controlled by a little group of persons (or one alone, who knows).

I can't give all the links here because not everything would be legit, but to sum up, here is what I noticed :

 - There is three escrow websites commonly cited : abescrow, thrucoin, and btcrow
 - These websites always appear on the same suspect website selling services that are ""too good to be true""
 - A research on some forums (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47068.0 for exemple) shows that these escrow websites do not seem trustable 
 - All of the websites I saw that were advertising these escrow were with almost no doubt fakes. Some of them were actually listed as scams on some onion link boards.

Given all that, the only thing I can think of is that there is a network of people using the same three escrow websites to run an enormous amount of scams on onion.

What are your thoughts on that ? Has anyone more information that could confirm or contradict what I saw ?

I have tried the ""Linux USB Builder"" but that has failed twice. To make sure it wasn't my drive, I used the builder to install Ubuntu from the built in menu and that worked perfectly, so the drive works and is bootable. I can get Tails running in VirtualBox but I can't get the USB to mount (if I can mount the usb then I can install it with the usb installer built into tails).

I also tried the manual install as detailed from tails website, the files show up fine but still won't boot. Any help here would be greatly appreciated, best case scenario is that it can be done through Virtualbox so I can have a persistent drive, worst case being that nothing I do will ever work. Thanks everyone.

UPDATE: I am trying the Builder again and it looks like it's working this time, the times it didn't work were finished too fast and this one looks like it's taking as long as the Ubuntu install did. I'd still like to install from virtualbox if possible though so I can have the persistent drive. I'll be rebooting in a minute to test this install and will post results.

UPDATE 2: That didn't work, basically it's hanging at 90%. I'm going to let it sit for a while to see if it eventually continues but it should have finished by now. :-(

UPDATE 3: I ran Virtualbox again, this time with the extension pack which I forgot to do last time, I had to add the USB in the filters list but it still showed grayed out and came across an article about user rights. From my Mac, I gave the USB read and write for everyone (not secure but the disk will get wiped anyway) Loaded up Tails from VB and went to the Tails USB installer, my USB showed up and I just finished the process. Going to reboot now to test it out. Good luck to me. :-)

UPDATE 4: Didn't work, it looked like it was going to boot but stopped with a flashing cursor. Maybe I'll try redoing it again, any tips or pointers from anyone?

1370408062.0,3,self.onions,1fpbsd,Is there a market for a simpler Bitcoin mixing service? (x-post from /r/Bitcoin),4,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1fpbsd/is_there_a_market_for_a_simpler_bitcoin_mixing/,"*I'd like feedback on an idea for a simpler Bitcoin mixing service. Skip to the header below if you don't want background.*

In searching for a good mixing service I found very few, only one that seemed to be used regularly (Bitcoin Fog).

I recognize that many vendors and platforms have their own services built-in now, but for folks who want anonymous coins who aren't buying anything from those vendors there aren't many options available.

The main option, [Bitcoin Fog](http://www.bitcoinfog.com/), requires registration, and you need to request a withdrawal for your funds after they've cleared. The site recommends anywhere from 1 day to a whole week for this process.

I've been thinking about a simpler way to do this, that could easily be implemented by many developers-. In fact, it might not even need a website at all. I don't have much spare time so I'm throwing the idea out here and seeing if it makes sense and if people are interested. If you are interested my contact information is below.

###How it works

I want to avoid registration, withdrawal requests, and significant delay -  the user would only need to fill out a simple form (or send an email), send the Bitcoin to a certain address, and get the same amount (minus fee) in a new address within a day.

This isn't possible with a specific amount of coins (such as 3.825), because the original address depositing the funds would be easily traced to the new address, based on the unique amount. The solution is a tiered system of depositing - only deposits of an exact amount are allowed. Everyone depositing the same amount and receiving the same amount will ensure the new addresses cannot be traced.

But the mixing service needs payment, and with this system they cannot take a percentage (Bitcoin Fog takes between 1-3%). The solution is to have the initial deposit be slightly larger than the new address. For example, a possible fee schedule is below.

| Deposit   | New Address |
|:-----------|------------:|
| 0.1005     | 0.1000      |        
| 1.0010     | 1.0000      |    
| 10.0100   |10.0000     | 

How does the mixing service know where to send the coins? I propose an input either from a website or even over email, that requires the following information *before* funds are sent:

- The ""dirty"" public address of the sender, where funds originate  
- The new ""clean"" public address they want to fund
- The amount they are sending - probably choosing a tier
- The exact time they will send the coins, presumably immediately afterwards

Once a deposit is made, the system would check the time stated by the user to verify. If it doesn't match, the coins are returned to sender. If it does match, then after an appropriate waiting period to ensure there are no other claims on the same deposit, then the coins would be deposited in the sender's clean address.

If there are multiple claims with the same accurate time, the coins would be returned to sender.

This system would only work if there are many incoming deposits in the same amount. Before the service became popular, it could only disburse funds when a certain amount of users made deposits - say a threshold of 15 deposits. That would then trigger an automatic dispersal.

Once the service is popular enough, it wouldn't need an arbitrary number, but could disperse on a schedule. Once a day should be adequate, but could be adjusted based on number of deposits. I imagine larger tiers (such as 100BTC) would receive limited enough deposits that they might make less frequent dispersal.

An obvious problem with mixing services is trust, since the owner of the address which deposits will be mixed could run away with the coins at any moment. I don't think I have a great answer to this, except to say that a flat rate mixing service with high volume could be profitable, and anyone with brains would rather run a profitable operation for a long time without ripping anyone off than destroy your reputation by cheating people.

Those are my thoughts. I'd love feedback here, point out flaws or ask questions. Would you use such a service?

TL;DR **I'm proposing a simpler system for Bitcoin mixing that doesn't require registration or withdrawal requests, and relies on matching the senders input with the details of the deposit to verify and disperse the clean coins.**",,False,self,t5_2r552,False,,,True,t3_1fpbsd,http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1fpbsd/is_there_a_market_for_a_simpler_bitcoin_mixing/,

1. Looking at code from a few .onion sites it looks just like regular html. Is the only difference the way its hosted? If so, are there things i cant or shouldnt do that i would have normally been able to do with a .com? Security and anonymity are obviously priority.

2. As far as hosting, i noticed Freedom Host (i believe thats what its called) seemed to be the only .onion host after reading through some forums and blogs, are there others? whats the pros and cons of that host? I have only ever used large companies like iPage and Bluehost. Also, as far as using one of my own computers as a server, is there any good tutorials on that anyone can link me to? I understand the concept and that its relatively easy, but is there a drastic difference from hosting a .com and a .onion? All the tutorials i find are on hosting .com's.

Well open up the tor browser and whois the IP of the exit node you've been allocated.

Anways here is two very good providers for dedicated/vps servers where you can run an exit node:
https://serverastra.com/ (They accept bitcoin, I've heard they are okay with it, but email them to be sure before running an exit node, most hosting providers have a policy of being able to change their terms of service/privacy policy without notifying you.)
http://www.100tb.com/ (Had a chat with them attached is the screen shot)
Here is a list of the cloudservers that 100tb offers with locations and test speeds: http://cloudtestfiles.net/

people to consider running a Tor node. I'm guessing a lot of you, like me,
don't have much use for Tor. But maybe you want to help out the Tor
network and the people who use it. Setting up a node is a relatively easy way
to do that.

I'm nowhere near as brilliant as the Tor developers and I have
neither the time nor the expertise to describe all the ins and
outs of being an operator of all the various node types in detail. So instead,
I'm just gonna describe a few things I considered when setting up a node as a
starting point for further research (the [Tor
project](https://www.torproject.org/) and google are both good resources).

First thing I considered was whether or not running a node was a good idea.
I got motivated to set one up by [this talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX46Qv_b7F4) given by two Tor
developers at 28c3. I think it's fantastic that by operating a node, I'm
helping out dissidents and citizens of oppressive governments, but I think
it's important to realize that Tor also enables people to hire assassins and
distribute CP, and I have no way of telling what content is passing through my
node. Ultimately, I feel that providing people with a way to help maintain
their anonymity online is generally a good thing, but others may feel
differently.

Another thing to consider is the risk involved, particularly for operating an
exit node. Traffic leaving the Tor network through your node will appear to be
coming from that node's IP, and if that traffic happens to be someone
downloading copyrighted media, you're the one that'll get the cease and desist
notice from RIAA. If a website gets spammed by someone, your IP address is the
one they'll block. [These](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/five-years-exit-node-operator) [two](https://blog.torproject.org/running-exit-node) blog posts cover how to mitigate a lot of
these risks. TL;DR, don't run an exit node from the same connection you use for
regular browsing.

It might also be worthwhile to consider running a [bridge
relay](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) or onion service. I haven't
done either of these so can't really say much about them. What I can say
is that if I were to run an onion site, I'd try to avoid leaking info as much
as humanly possible.

Erm, that's all I have. Hope this was helpful. If you're interested in setting up a node, the Tor project has instructions [here](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en).

If you have done all correctly when you connect through the proxy to check.torproject.org you should get the green onion! Enjoy!

The reaction to recent revelations about government surveillance has been a defensive one: use encryption, use Tor, use PGP, etc. This is good advice, but it won't prevent further government encroachment, and certainly won't roll back any intrusions.

But funding anonymous actions that question government authority is very difficult, especially for an entire community. To address this problem, I'm proposing a platform that will allow for the anonymous funding and verification of crowd-directed action.

The paper is hosted here: vg7remvvo2dnyeo3.onion/Treasury.html

**Abstract**. *This paper discusses the establishment of an online system that would (1.) allow a community to propose actions, (2.) enable the community to signal support for those actions by funding them, (3.) establish a mechanism to verify which agent(s) can claim the reward for completing the action, and (4.) disperse payment. Using a variety of existing technologies, such as Tor and Bitcoin, both funders and agents would remain anonymous.*

However, when I attempted to see the site via the onion address that TOR gave me, it (I assume properly) attempts to redirect me to the localhost address, but won't run it.

Can anyone give some aid to this?

Edit: This line in particular in regards to localhost ""This ensures your website is only accessible from your local computer, so people can’t access it over the normal Web and see you’re hosting the hidden service Tor site."" has me a bit confused.

I need to be able to pay online anonymously for a VPS to run a Tor Hidden Service. Bitcoin is not an option. I've looked into prepaid credit card but every single one I find needs to be activated with an ID card or a passport.

The cost of the service I need is around $100/yr, I'm willing to double it for anonymity, but not much more (because I can't).

I don't know if that matters to you, but I want to say that the only reason I want to protect my privacy is because of unclear copyright issue, no drugs or pedobear stuff involved.

I downloaded the latest version of Wordpress (3.4.1) from http://wordpress.org/ and unzipped it. I created a folder called ""blog"" just to test it (since if i upload all the files automatically to the main folder, it fails too) and uploaded all the files.

Im able to pass the 5-minute Wordpress installation easily. Im also able to access the wp-admin page (which is the admin panel of my blog) but the problem is, when I go DIRECTLY to the homepage of my blog, it fails. It just shows something like this:

Before it was blocked, I would use chrome, find a Torrent I want, click ""Download this torrent using magnet."" Then, a message saying something like ""An external application is needed to handle:..."" would pop up, and I'd click ""launch application"". UTorrent would click in, I'd choose the folder to download into and the torrent would download. Easy peasy. Using Tor, when I click ""launch application"" nothing happens. The dialogue box disappears, UTorrent doesn't kick in and nothing is downloaded.

I'm guessing there's an easy way to fix this, but I can't think what it could be. I'm no expert.
