Take the internet, for example: kids in high school are making some terrible decisions about their online identity and privacy, which could potentially be damaging in the future. How is a class informing them how to use the internet responsibly any different than a sex-ed class teaching them to use condoms?  They should learn about personal finance, predatory lending and the risks of credit card debt, their basic rights, how to write a résumé, maybe how to change a tire and CPR.

In this way, they're basically saying that ""black person"" and ""slave"" are synonymous. Which, given the time and place they sort of were. I understand that that's not their intention, and the way the word is used in the book it does fit. 

* ie ""When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with a quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a **nigger** a good ways off."" -Pg. 5

However, for some reason the whole concept just doesn't sit well with me. Having Huck as the unreliable narrator is a major thematic device in that book. Readers *need* to cringe every time they read innocent, likeable Huck saying such a derogatory term so casually. Huck as the unreliable narrator is a major device in the book. That language is a part of his lens. His transformation as he learns that everything his society has taught him (including the use of the n-word) is the point of the book. 

Maybe I'm wrong, it's been a long time since I've read it, but I was just wondering what everyone else thinks.

I was given the ""gifted"" label in kindergarten, and that began 13 years of constant reminders that I was ""smart."" In second grade, my school transferred the ""gifted"" kids into an AG program where we learned accelerated science, math, and English skills for a couple hours a day while the rest of our class stayed with the curriculum.

The kids that were on that same ""smart kid"" ride with me, at some point or another, ended up completely burned out, lazy, clinically depressed, and/or neurotic.

In 6th grade, they split the ~90 kids in my grade into three classes: 6A, the ""above average"" kids, 6B, the ""average"" kids, and 6C, the ""below average"" kids. This was a clear message to us, at 11, that we were either ""smart,"" ""normal,"" or ""dumb."" This continued on through 8th grade.

I don't know if they thought we were are completely ambivalent to how we'd been categorized, but these classes caused so many ridiculous issues. When all the kids went on field trips together or attended dances, socialization with the other classes was always really weird. There were clear delineations as to who could hang out with whom. Effectively, we ended up with class segregation.

In 6A, most of us were white, either very popular or very dorky, and we all came from middle and upper class families in the same part of town. The kids in 6C were almost all from just one lower-class neighborhood, many were black or Hispanic, and most of them had been labeled by the school as having ""behavioral issues.""

Every single one of us ""smart kids"" ended up taking entirely AP, Advanced, and CP classes in high school. We'd been told our entire lives that we were budding geniuses, and that's why we were taking these classes.

If we performed poorly (for any reason), we were basically just told that we were ""smarter than that"" and that we were being lazy (cue parental Look of Disapproval). The ""below average"" kids were expected to screw up, and no one had any expectations for them, so they had pretty much no incentive to perform well.

We're all 23 and 24 now, and maybe three or four of those kids in my advanced classes actually went on to become doctors/teachers/rocket scientists or whatever they expected us to be. All us ""smart"" kids went to college, all the ""dumb"" kids took vocational classes in high school and may have ended up at the local community college (if they were lucky). Now, most of us ""smart kids"" are living mostly ""average"" lives -- at some point, we all got burned out on being told how ""smart"" we were and not being able to handle the pressure of having the gift of being ""gifted.""

Our greatest fears had been letting our parents/teachers down, because clearly they already knew that we were ""smart"" -- and if we couldn't live up to that, there was something wrong with us.

The segregation that I experienced, in my opinion, did a complete disservice to all of us. The ""smart"" kids burned out and most the ""dumb"" kids (who, for the most part, weren't really ""dumb"" at all) were under the poverty line within a year after high school -- if anyone benefited from that stupid system, it was the ""average"" kids who were taught that work was actually worth something.

I've heard similar stories from friends who came from other school systems, but I always wonder how widespread this actually is -- particularly across age groups. I get the impression that people in their 30s+ didn't experience the whole ""you're smart, so your life will be great without you needing to lift a finger"" thing quite as much as those of us in our teens and 20s.

**TL;DR**: School system segregated ""smart/average/dumb"" kids for over a decade; ""smart"" kids fell on their asses in the real world because we didn't understand that ""Smart"" was not going to be a qualifier on a résumés. Have you experienced something similar?

**Edit:** I know this is already a novel, but I think a lot of points need to be mentioned here.

Many people have mentioned [this research](http://nymag.com/print/?/news/features/27840/) into the ""smart"" label, which is definitely worth a read for everyone (especially if you have/plan on having kids) -- domirillo made [a comment about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/e449s/recent_story_about_the_proficiency_of_black/c156t9v), which prompted me to post this thread. 

YouJustLostTheGame also makes some excellent points and analysis [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/e4ejp/dae_feel_like_being_labeled_a_smart_kid_set_them/c158f4b).

General advice to redditors who experienced ""smart kid"" syndrome and have found themselves lost is pretty much the same -- to focus on work ethic, controlling your own expectations, and not to withdraw for fear of failure, but personally, I think there are different bits of advice for people of different ages, [some of which I added in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/e4ejp/dae_feel_like_being_labeled_a_smart_kid_set_them/c15fb8a). **Please feel free to add your own advice**. A lot of redditors seem to relate to this issue, and the more perspective and experience we put together, the more helpful we can be to each other.

The younger you are, the better chance you have of escaping the most severe burn-outs. A lot of redditors out of high school have commented that they developed serious drug/alcohol issues, and while it's incredibly inspiring that some of them have been able to turn things around, it's definitely a very real cautionary tale.

Since so many people expressed problems with addictions, depression, and suicidal thoughts: Keep in mind that if you're not comfortable with ""conventional"" ways of handling these issues, remember that reddit is a huge community, and chances are there are hundreds (if not thousands) of people who have been in your shoes and can offer help.

I want to point out that KarmaDecay is good for more than just reducing reposts.

  * You know the image was posted already and you want to find the comments about it.
  * You have a gif and want to see if it was on reddit, because that will usually lead you to the source.
  * You personally don't want to look like a noob.
  * Its funny to watch people keep reposting their image many times believing that each time it fails it is just because of timing. They won't accept that it just isn't funny.

The spirit of the message remains, though others who agree with me below have stated the argument a little more eloquently than I did originally. This is certainly not the biggest problem facing us right now by a long shot, I just feel it's indicative of a society that praises kids too much for the mundane and that such behavior has consequences that, while subtle, are important to consider. I'm not against fun or parties, I just feel like have graduations at virtually every step of the way seems a little silly, it seems like praise overkill, and at the extremes at may be teaching the kids to be extrinsically motivated to learn. I don't know, I still don't think I'm being clear, read through all of the comments, maybe everyone will shift a little closer to center.

Personally, I'm a little offended that I'm being teased for utilizing my intelligence, and what's worse is that I don't know if I'm in the right or if I'm actually being [pretentious, snobbish, etc.]. I've resorted to ""dumbing-down"" a lot of my conversation and, increasingly, tend to keep to myself. Not that we all don't joke around like this from time to time, but I feel like this is an example of a much scarier attitude found throughout America.

At any given moment, I am thinking of my guilty acts, my regrets, my fears or pornography. Self destruction gets the best of me.

I wish I could just defrag my brain and organize everything. I wish I wouldn't have to think about the things I find myself thinking about. Like when my puppy died. The image will randomly appear without warning and I'll be mentally paralyzed for a short moment. It drives me crazy.

EDIT: I already put this as a comment, but I think it should go here so that it will get more attention, and I'll get fewer responses saying the same things. 

What works for many, may not work for all.

Also, drugs. While this comment does not mention it, many other comments have encouraged me to use marijuana, LSD or mushrooms to sort myself out. I've never done any of these drugs(or drank, for that matter). I'm NOT straight edge. I don't slap beers out of peoples hands at parties. I have many friends who drink and do drugs and I have absolutely zero problem with them. I'm gonna repeat that, because I recently had a friend flip her shit out on me because I made a joke (the both of us have a very acerbic sense of humor) at her rampant drug use and sexual forays. She took it very seriously, and one thing lead to another and she told me that I am pretentious(because I do not do drugs/drink), that I'll live a life of regrets (because I do not do drugs/drink) and that she wants me out of her life permanently. Oh well. She was a good friend.

Other people do drugs, that's fine with me. I don't. I don't want to. I've never wanted to. There are many ways of solving problems. The way that you've chosen may suit you, but it may not suit others. I'm not being picky. I have one field that I do not want to enter. The rest of the entire world of recovery and wellness is open game for me.

And because of the wildly perverse nature of my dreams, my inability to fall asleep without hours of twitching on an uncomfortable metal spring mattress (lol, tempurpedic), sleep isn't the lovely, warm escape for me that it is for you.

Watch The Machinist, with Christian Bale. It explains life without rest better than I can.

And finally, no. I'm not saying or doing anything for pity. I'm not fourteen. I'm not trying to pull your heartstrings or make you or anyone worried, at all, ever. Period. I made this post not because I want to have a bunch of people cooing to me, telling me to please be better, but to see if others were as disorganized as me.

That is all. Thank you, everyone, for your responses.

It's obvious that people are going through this and simply downvoting every comment I have made, because even the most innocuous statements are getting negative votes. I really don't get some people.

EDIT AGAIN: 

Holy shit, nine hundred or so upvotes. That's fantastic. Thank you everyone for responding...and I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I sounded harsh or abrasive in my commenting. I really had no intention to step on any toes. Really, seriously, my apologies. 

Thanks again for all your input. I'm gonna meditate for ten minutes a day, for thirty days, and record my results.

I'm not going to start smoking pot or taking shrooms. Money and I simply don't want to do it. 

And I'm not going to blow my brains out with a shotgun, as the lowest downvoted comment suggests. Mainly because that shit is expensive, and I've got to record a few albums before anyone would give a shit. Ha.

I've received a lot of hand me down clothing over the years and very one of them that has been from an event or location has been dropped off at a donation box.


Same goes with branded things in general, I guess I just dislike being a billboard.

I even own a bunch of cool shirts *(band shirts, gun shirts, geeky shirts)* but I never wear them, I just haven't found an appropriate time to wear them around yet.

In the US, we generally are taught to drive in high school in a brief amount of time (split time with gym class, in many cases), then put on the road at age 16. Never again do we have to prove that we know the rules of the road, driving etiquette, maneuvering skills, or even very basic knowledge of the law. 

Would it be economically viable for the states to require another written and on-road exam every 10 years after your license is granted? 

**The key part is this:** the test would get more difficult every 10 years, based on the assumption that your experience has made you that much of a better driver, and that much more aware of the rules and laws associated with operating a motor vehicle.

My basis and reasoning behind this is pretty obvious: most drivers are *terrible*. Everyone, yes even you, has at least one thing that they *think* is the law, that is actually wrong. They practice this habit and rage when people don't yield to them, or do things differently. 

I think a better **mandatory** education and accreditation process could avoid a substantial amount of the road rage, accidents, confusion, and general chaos that takes place on our public roads. It could even be a viable way for states to fund the DOT programs, who knows.

There could be a fee to go along with this, something like $100 per written exam (over 10 years that isn't much at all), and all on-road classes would have to be accredited by strict standards, but private companies could also compete. The driver would have a full year to complete both, which is a very ample amount of time. 

This would ideally weed out those that simply don't belong behind the wheel. Yes, this would likely affect grandpa. But how many times have you heard of an elderly person veering off the road and mowing down a crowd of people? I've heard of that happening twice in the past few years. 

Remember folks, driving is a PRIVILEGE, not a RIGHT. There is public transportation for a reason. 

Does this belong on /r/getoffmylawn/ or do you think this is a good idea? How could it be accomplished? I'm really interested in everyone's opinion. If there is support and I can craft a case, I might write to my governor. 

tl;dr: Drivers suck. Making mandatory education and testing every decade after issue of license might make everyone's lives easier in the end.

What I meant in the title by ""super shy [people]"" was people who used to be overly shy/socially anxious, were very critical about themselves, self-conscious, etc. These are just examples, but if you've had something similar please share, your input is just as awesome!!!

Would be really interesting discussion and good for all my fellow 'forever-aloners' and what not who are lurking around here.

EDIT: Removed tl;dr which may have appeared rude and not complying with reddiquette.

EDIT: Those still shy should have a look at top comment. To be really blunt it is a pretty arduous journey, but don't get discouraged... Sorry for being short... it's 3am and I need to sleep! 

And thanks for the upvotes guys! Not only are you giving me an over-inflated feeling of self worth (haha), but you're improving the chances that someone shy might see this thread and hopefully take something good out of it. Your upvotes are good and you should feel good! (bah that sounded cheesy but I just had to make that reference)

EDIT: weirdwun mentioned that it sounded like I was implying shyness is wrong. It isn't! Sorry about the wording of the title, I didn't mean to imply that, but perhaps for me it felt wrong, but that doesn't mean that it is wrong.

EDIT: Had 2 hours of sleep... couldn't get back to it :(... Anyway, thanks guys so much for your awesome responses!! It's really reassuring to see that practically all people here went through very similar journeys to get to where they want to be! You're doing a great service by posting a comment, so don't be shy... (I know, I cringe every time someone says 'don't be shy')

**Those who would like to make a change please read these steps:**
 Okay, I've read a lot of the comment here and have learnt a lot. Here's my attempt at a step by step solution for shy busting using both my knowledge/experience and the collective Reddit knowledge/experiences:

Zero. Make sure that you really want to this. Main reasons for wanting it are: feel depressed, don't have many friends and would like more, want a girl/boyfriend, find it harder than you think you should to do some things (eg ask people for directions). Its good to know your motivation for doing this before doing so.

1. Make a change in your lifestyle and/or circumstances. Examples include but not limited to: change of environment (move houses, take a long trip to somewhere new, fix bad sleeping habits, change schools/job, start working out)
2. Recognise the patterns of thought that you go through when in a position of shyness. Try to come up with some opposing thoughts to those (was very hard for me). When you get the urges to think the negative thoughts about yourself, try remember the opposing thoughts you came up with earlier.
3. If you start feeling less shy and whatever you're doing is working, then first off: congratulations! You've done one big half of the work. The next part, which is actually what I'm up to is: staying on track and not letting yourself slip back to bad habits. I think it generally takes 4 to 6 weeks for a habit to stick so keep that in mind and try your best to keep it up!
4. ??? 
5. Profit.

Feel free to analyze the meaning of my dream or tell me what dreams you had and still think about.

My Dream:
I went to a restaurant, and for whatever reason, the restaurant, by tradition, hands out fishing rods to those waiting to be seated so they can fish in the nearby water while they waited.  I was handed a rod, and took it across the street to the water, which seemed like a lake, though instead of a gradual shore, it went deep immediately at the edge, like a swimming pool or the canals in Venice.  Before I cast, I noticed the line on the rod split about a foot or two from the end and had two large hooks, one for each line.  I thought it seemed odd, but I shrugged it off and cast into the water anyways.  Almost immediately I got a catch and reeled it in.  To my surprise I had caught 2 fish, one on each hook.  When I reeled it in, I realized I had caught a large mouth bass on one hook and a sea turtle on the other.  With both the sea turtle and bass still in the water I reached down to try and free the sea turtle as I didn’t want to hurt it any more than I already had. As I was struggling to free the turtle, (and with each attempt to free it, I seemed to be ripping a larger hole in the turtle’s mouth), a shark came and ripped the bass off the line and ate it.  In my surprise I stepped back, and then watched the shark eat the sea turtle as well.  After both had been eaten, an even larger shark came and ate the shark that had just finished devouring the bass and sea turtle.  The larger shark ate everything but the tailfin of the smaller shark.

(clarification: intentionally ironic)

I feel like feminists are overdramatic.  I get the sense they feel like all men are out to get women and think of women as pure sex objects, when that's just not true.

For instance, the hockey team at my school painted the central message board with an ad for their upcoming game, and painted a scantily-clad woman to attract attention to it.  Obviously this was very wrong, but the feminist group on campus rallied the troops to paint another message next to it saying this is an example of ""rape culture"" and that women are oppressed because of this picture.  Having a WTF look on my face, I googled the term and saw it meant portraying sexualized violence as acceptable.  This had absolutely nothing to do with what the hockey team did.

I know someone who takes the opportunity to every joking comment about women on Facebook to decry how men are pigs and women need help overcoming the evil world awaiting them.  I cringe every time I see that she's commented on something because she takes everything to a whole new level.

I'm a strong supporter of equal treatment and think proactive steps should be taken to make sure opportunities are the same for everyone.  But when things like this happen, I tend to lose a little bit of that passion and feel like feminists could only be hurting their cause.

Commence the downvoting!

Edit: thank you to MuForceShoelace for the revised tl;dr

Edit 2: As expected, I see a lot of comments that I don't understand feminism.  I'm simply stating that the outspoken feminists (the ones representing feminists as a whole) often overexaggerate events and comments.  I'd be a lot more supportive of feminists if they would approach subjects more reasonably, because at present, I wouldn't associate with feminists even though I support women's rights.

Compare this to what was invented or came in to popular use in the *previous* 60 year period:

* Airplanes/aviation
* Electricity
* Rocket space ships
* Cars
* Telephones
* Radio
* Televison/cinematography
* Relativity/quantum physics (scientist started to mess with TIME itself)
* Nuclear physics (scientists started messing with the fabric of matter to create and use MINI SUNS)

It would only be natural to assume in the 1950s that the next 60 years would be marked by almost unimaginable changes - yet it seems to me, someone time travelling from the 1890s to the 1950s would be way more impressed by the changes than someone travelling from the 1950s to to the 2010s. singularity my ass
