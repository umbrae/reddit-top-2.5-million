",3243,1239,842,http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/arc79/reddit_i_got_the_best_present_a_girl_developer/,"So, to give you a little background me and this guy went on a few dates and he moved far away. We got along well, things didn't get very far. He is really nice, however, I wasn't leaning one way or the other. 

He sent me the Post Secret books for xmas. He hinted at another present, but said I had to wait. It's a little after Christmas, but I got this email yesterday with the title ""I wanted to make something for you for Christmas"":

""So I told the computer, and it showed me how to write a poem in byte-form.  I can't tell what you're thinking these days, but this will either remind you of something that was good, or send you off.""


It included a link to a poem.zip file, which I downloaded. Inside, there was a file called magicfile with no extension and a ReadMe that said:

""Intructions:

 1: &gt; copy magicfile magicfile.jpg
 2: &gt; copy magicfile magicfile.zip
 ... skip a few ...
 X: Ask it for help""

When I renamed magicfile it turned into a picture of me! (a bad one that he took, but ok) and when I changed magicfile to a .zip inside it contained: Magicfile.exe and a txt called ""Go Ahead"" that said:

""It's safe.  Requires WPF and .Net 3.5 I think...

Whatever, it works on my machine.""

I opened magicfile, and an interface popped up that said ""enter a passphrase"". So, I typed in ""help"" and got this:

""Hi Sara!

As you are just about figuring out, this is just the very beginning of a very, very large rabbit hole you're about to fall into.

You see, sometime in early November, I had an idea for an awesome program.  Simultaneously I was just beginning to think of what might be a decent Christmas present for you.  Put 2 and 2 together, and you get this thing.  I worked on it on and off for a few weeks - it was a pretty fun way to learn WPF and do a lot of interesting byte manipulation.

You see, it's a completely self-contained magical file.  This magical file is three parts:
 1. If you name it .jpg - it's an image!
 2. If you name it .zip - it's a zip file, containing a program
 3. It's a database of many, many more parts that the program reads

Now, when you run the program, it reads the magic file, and asks for a passphrase.

You're obviously gotten that far, or you wouldn't be reading this.  As you can imagine - there are a bunch of passwords.  Not infinite, but many.  I encourage you to guess at words and try to figure them out.  I'll give you the hints that they would be things relevant to you or to us.

With a little ingenuity, you'll be able to figure out a very important passphrase that will take you to the next step...""


As I have gone on and solved some of the mysteries I have found that pictures of me come up, things he's researched, things we did together and so on and so forth. I still am trying to figure out the important passphrase. 

Reddit, this is the most beautiful gift I have ever gotten and it leaves me in a funny place possibly going on the other side of the world to see what happens here. He is an avid redditor, and though I hate the ""VOTE THIS UP, PLOX"" posts I'd love to get this on the front page to show him what this meant. Thank you. 

tl;dr:

A nerd made a beautiful nerd gift for me, it was a program that was a mystery and shows things we did together. Please vote this up to show him how much it meant. 



**EDIT:** A lot of people are saying that the fact that I am unsure about what to do means I don't like him. That is not at all the case, I like him a lot. I really enjoyed spending time with him, he is brilliant (there is nothing I like more than a man that can teach me things), funny, and best of all a great time. 

In order to go see him right now I have to take a 14hr plane flight. Which means I would be staying a week, and I'm not sure I'm quite at that point yet.

Here's the whole story: http://www.theweinerworks.com/?p=86

***********

My sites are down, so perhaps I can reach out through reddit:

Dear dude who keeps hacking my sites,
A lot of people would take this opportunity to rant about hackers being dickheads. I'm not going to do that. It's unproductive, and it fails to recognize the contributions hackers and ex-hackers have made to society. I firmly believe that a strong community of hackers is part of citizens' protection from government encroachment on freedom of speech online.

That said, let me tell you why  you shouldn't hack my site.

First, the professional. Regardless of what you think of me personally (though I don't know if this is whence the maliciousness), SMBC's success helps a lot of people. I have a part time assistant and a business manager who make an important part of their income off my ad revenue. Whenever you knock down the site (or lessen its traffic by loading trojans), you decrease my income, and thereby decrease my ability to pay for these people.

Additionally, the success of SMBC helps pay for SMBC Theater. SMBC Theater is a project that, on any given weekend, might bring together one or two dozen talented people putting in their spare time for something they love. When you mess with my revenue stream, you also jeopardize that. Again, regardless of how you feel about me or that project, what you're doing poses potential harm to a lot of nice, intelligent, hard working people.

Whenever you knock down my servers, other websites go down as well. This includes Snowflakes, The Weinerworks, and Weinersmith. All of these are sites that I, James, Chris Jones, and Kelly work on without making much of return, and all of them are educational sites. When you down these, the way I see it, it makes the world a teeny tiny little bit worse. 

I don't consider myself to have a great amount of influence over the way people behave, but in my short career I have the privilege of helping a lot of young people. I've gotten countless emails from people saying I helped them through depression, inspired them to take on challenges, and encouraged them to stay in difficult academic programs. I don't believe for a second that they did these things BECAUSE of me - nobody does anything hard without putting in the bulk of the effort  personally. But, I do believe SMBC provides a helpful service to a lot of good people, and I'm very lucky to be the conduit for that service. When you down my site (or any of the others), this goes away.

I suspect a lot of the above could be said about many websites, and that's sort of my point. I understand hackers who try to get at sensitive information, or who try to harass jerks. I don't understand what the value is in taking down a site like mine, which provides nothing but jokes and information.

Lastly, whenever you hack my site, it causes a lot of anxiety for me, and for everyone who works with me. Right now, because of this latest attack, my brother (who was at work, and who has two lovely kids) had to run home to deal with this problem. In other words - when you attack my site, you're not just attacking some abstract thing on the Internet. You're causing physical distress to a lot of people who don't deserve it.

So please, please just stop.

Thanks,
Zach Weinersmith

tl;dr: When you hack my servers, you distress me and others physically and financially. We're not a black box - we're real people. So we'd all take it very kindly if you'd stop.

PS: Because this is reddit, I want to be clear: I'm not asking for any internet justice. Just sending a message in a bottle, hoping it falls into the right hands.

EDIT: Holy crap! Thanks for all the upvotes and advice. I think we have resolved the problem, and I'll see if I can get Marty (webmaster/brother) to post about it.

There are fancier ways to do this, but this is so much more usable than the stupid crap volume controls you guys are putting on so many apps right now.

* [dragon fractal clock](http://www.blahbleh.com/clock.php) (clock) is a clock that counts down to the end of the hour in the shape of a dragon curve. Handy for counting down to the end of a boring lecture/lesson/meeting/party.

* [sierpinski clock](http://www.blahbleh.com/clock3.php) (clock3) is a clock that (again) counts down to the end of the hour, but this time as a Sierpinski triangle. (I'm starting to wish there were more weird-shaped progress bars around!) See also, the slightly fancier version (clock3a).

* [binary solo](http://www.blahbleh.com/clock7b.php) (clock7b) is a binary clock (that's pretty much it). To be honest, I can't use it myself to tell the time even though I made it, because... it's binary.

* [timedrain](http://www.blahbleh.com/clock4.php) (clock4) is the one I'm happiest with — you can watch your seconds (and minutes and hours) slowly drain away. Depressing and fun, at the same time! This is the only one that works in IE.

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback guys and gals, much appreciated! :D

Then you bring up the very beginning of what you just coded, not even really describing what you did, just that you did it, and the eyes glaze over and silence arises. It's mystifying. 

I feel like I'm fairly interested in a lot of things. I'll take a chance to hear about some geo-thermic shit, I play guitar so I want to know about some jazz chords, but I've yet to meet anyone outside of the programming world seem *at all* interested in coding. It's weird. 

What I'm really trying to say is, when I finish something I've been coding for a while and I want to show it to someone in real life, I can't (I never made friends in the comp. sci. dept. of my school, those guys are the most socially awkward people ever). My friend can show me the song he wrote, or my other friend can talk to me about some work he was doing with physics and the Tesla coil he built himself, but damn if some code I write isn't worth the pixels it's held on. 

I'm the programmer in the house, so whenever I say I'm coding they call it ""1s and 0s"" (indeed, my music major roommate and I even wrote a song about it called ""Binary Blues""), ""hax0ring"" (we say that out loud). One of my roommate refers to everything I do as ""buffering"".

1255379079.0,689,self.programming,9tcn5,"The RIAA's favorite thread of all time: A discussion of designs for sustainable (anonymous, high performance, lawsuit-proof) file sharing networks.",1005,316,675,http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9tcn5/the_riaas_favorite_thread_of_all_time_a/,"I feel like there are a bunch of ideas floating around right now and if they were combined in the right way, then the game is over.

Any successful sustainable file sharing needs to offer the following features:

-High performance (this is why Kazaa, Limewire, Bittorrent, and Rapidshare all did so well in their respective heyday periods, slow will always fail like [Freenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet) and [Tor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network\))'s current state)

-Anonymity between the uploaders and the downloaders to prevent MAFIAA B.S.

-Useful search tools (any number of solutions for this, but it is tricky on a [DHT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) system)

-[Poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_group_efforts_against_file_sharing#Peer-to-peer_network_poisoning) resistance (basically, better hashing than was done in Kazaa, modern stuff generally has this solved)

-Incentives to share (the BT trackers get this right)

-All traffic encrypted to prevent ISPs and proxies from observing traffic (Tor/Freenet style to keep everyone that forwards traffic blind)

-Prefer to keep everything internal to the network and have no concept of exit nodes (like [Tor's hidden services](http://www.torproject.org/hidden-services.html.en) or something similar)

-Open to anyone that wants to join without invites (this eliminates [friend-to-friend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend)/[darknets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing\)))

-Flexible routing and robust storage (DHTs are great for this, also makes F2F useless IMHO)

-Completely open source and decentralized so no companies can be sued to take the network down (BT already figured this out). More on this here: http://www.eff.org/files/p2p_copyright_wp_v5_0.pdf

There may be more requirements, but I feel like if all of these were combined, then the game is over and the nerds win. In particular, with anonymous communication and incentives to upload, downloaders can just leave all of their files available permanently, vastly increasing the performance, which further adds to the utility in a positive feedback loop.

Obviously, some of these requirements seem to conflict at first glance. But given how fast P2P systems have come in a decade, which includes the entire history from Napster to DHTs to everything else, I think they will be overcome in the relatively near future. This is a classic example of how arms races promote technology. I feel that without extremely draconian laws that outlaw cryptography and network neutrality, there is absolutely no way for big content to win this in the long run. Digital information is, for all practice purposes, a [public good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) (it is non-rival and non-exclusive thanks to the ability to make infinite copies for almost free). The legal system is set up assuming that IP is a [private good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_good) and will not change unless it is forced by outside pressure. Eventually, they will either accept file sharing or not. But if the technology makes enforcement impossible, it really doesn't matter.

One protocol that looks promising to me is [BitBlinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitblinder). I have not been able to test it yet though (haven't got an invite), but the [incentive structure](http://bitblinder.com/learn/dev/) they present might be enough to get a fast onion routing network working. Although onion routing adds computation overhead and 3x or more latency, in theory it should be able to sustain high throughput (which is all we care about for high performance file sharing) if there are enough routers in the network.

Please reply with comments on the issues I mentioned, any additional requirements you can think of, any systems you know of that meet these requirements, and anything else related.

Note: I am not here to discuss the morality of file sharing. I am not even a file sharer myself (haven't even used BT in a couple years). I just want to see innovation and see some good old fashioned [creative destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction). In Reddit's meme language: I just want to see the world burn.

Edit: added links.

Edit 2: Holy shit. Great response. Thanks for contributing and keep the good info coming. I'm going to try to comb through this info and hopefully can refine this idea further. Maybe a Wiki page is in order. Any suggestions for where to post?

Edit 3: 
OneSwarm has been nominated. I'm still a bit skeptical b/c it's F2F, but within that constraint, it seems to be otherwise ideal.

Website: http://oneswarm.cs.washington.edu/

sub-reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/oneswarm/
