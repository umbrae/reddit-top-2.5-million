1352756709.0,69,self.ccna,13323l,"Today I scored 937 and 944 on back-to-back ICND1 and ICND2 tests, first attempt. Here's how:",79,10,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/13323l/today_i_scored_937_and_944_on_backtoback_icnd1/,"Today I scored 937 and 944 on back-to-back ICND1 and ICND2 tests, first attempt. Here's how:
Since my local testing center recently had some sort of falling out with Pearson VUE, I had to catch a 2-hour flight (cost: $200!) to get certified. This encouraged me to prepare extra-thoroughly, in order to one-shot my CCNA and avoid the cost of multiple round-trips to another city.  
  
Here's an important disclaimer: I built my study plan around my own particular circumstances, and so your mileage will inevitably vary. For context, here's a bit on my educational background: I've had to put my undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science on hold during my fourth year, thanks to recession-induced financial collapse. I earned my A+ and Network+ certs back in 2003, and since then have accumulated what's perhaps the equivalent of 3 full-time years of semi-relevant work experience. I knew enough, for example, about ping, tracert and ipconfig, but hardly anything about subnets, switching or routing.  
  
There are two more important details. By the time I began to prepare for my CCNA, I'd had the good fortune of landing a marginally-acceptable job. For this reason, while I had (and still have) a profound yearning for a better life, I wasn't in an un(der)employment-fueled mad rush. Also, I decided to go the two-exam route to ""bank"" my intellectual investment, so to speak. That said, here is the plan I settled on:  
  
Phase 1: I read Lammle's study guide. Specifically, I did nothing but read the guide, cover to cover. I didn't take notes or do review exercises, or even spend much time lost in thought about unfamiliar topics. This wasn't skimming, per se; instead, I truly read the entire book, and only stopped to re-read parts when basic reading comprehension eluded me (i.e. upon encountering poorly-worded sections or sleep-induced idiocy). The take-home message here is not to stress over parts that seem strange. Instead, just let them stew.  
  
Phase 2: I re-read Lammle's study guide. This time, however, I took notes and completed all written labs and review exercises. Unlike my last time through the book, I also read the hands-on labs. However, my sheer infantile impatience and motivatonal inertia prevented me from actually doing them, despite having already installed Cisco Packet Tracer.  
Here's the gist of my note-taking strategy: I produced a summary of Lammle's book that doesn't contain Lammle's ""bonus commentary"". I was left with fairly cut-and-dry facts and IOS commands that were much easier to use as reference material.  
  
Phase 3: I compiled every IOS command mentioned in Lammle's study guide into a handy-dandy reference hierarchy (tree structure). The tree's root was ""USER EXEC MODE"", which is what you'd encounter on a freshly-rebooted router or switch. This would branch out into other modes (like ""PRIVELIGED EXEC MODE"") and commands (like ""enable""). Instead of adding multi-keyword commands like ""show ip interface brief"" as a single entry in the tree, I represented them as a network of branches and leaves, so that, for example, both [""ip"" -&gt; ""interface"" -&gt; ""brief""] and [""cdp"" -&gt; ""neighbors""] would branch off of the ""show"" node. The upshot: it's easier to remember interrelated pathways that traverse concisely-named nodes than long and perhaps seemingly-unrelated commands. I used MindJet, my favorite mapping program, but there's no reason why you can't do this with any other mind-mapping program, or indentations in any text editor, or paper and pen.  
  
Phase 4: I watched Jeremy Cioara's CBT Nuggets videos for ICND1 and ICND2. While sticklers for grammar, diction and brevity might find it difficult to sit through hour upon hour of this material, it's still a great resource. It's more ""visual"" than a textbook, which helps, and it fills many of the lacunae left by Lammle. Highly recommended.  
  
Phase 5: I experimented with simulators and emulators. I found Cisco Packet Tracer easier to use than GNS3, even though is omits some IOS functionality. Learning switching with GNS3 was too problematic for me, and this became a key reason for choosing CPT over GNS3. After testing a few different approaches to simulation, I found one that worked best for me. I would start with two hosts attached to one switch and configure a functional LAN. This covered base configurations, followed by IP addressing and VLANS. I then moved up to a router-on-a-stick by adding one router, and then added more routers to practice routing and WAN technologies. While I enjoyed this ""bottom-up"" approach more than a ""top-down"" sequence (starting from a pair of routers connected point-to-point), do what feels right to you.  
  
Phase 6: I attempted all the practice questions I could get my hands on. While nearly all of them were multiple-choice questions, they certainly helped. It is crucial that you attempt each question before you check the answer: Cognitive Science studies (e.g. Siefert et al 1995) show that reaching an impasse greatly facilitates problem solving ability. Reading the answer right away is far less useful. In any case, save the practice question marathon for the very end, after you've gained a strong understanding of more basic principles and theory. It's your exam-prep dessert, and not an appetizer like Phase 1 was.  
  
The result: over 93% on both tests, with 40 and 7 minutes to spare respectively.  
  
And now for some much-needed shut-eye...

Implement an IP addressing scheme and IP Services to meet network requirements in a medium-size Enterprise branch office network: 88%

Configure and troubleshoot basic operation and routing on Cisco devices: 73%

Implement, verify, and troubleshoot NAT and ACLs in a medium-size Enterprise branch office network: 67%

I will admit, I did spend the least amount of time on NAT and ACLs in my studying.

(My IPV6 studying consisted of me watching a video on the basics the night before the exam)

I thought I would have enough time on the exam by just taking my time and thinking through the questions deliberately, but I was very wrong, I came very close to not finishing on time if I hadn't picked up my pace during the end.

Though on the 640-802 there was limited actual subnetting questions it was extremely nice to be able to cross out bogus answers by quickly eliminating them with this. This was paramount on questions with network diagrams, 6-7 multiple choice questions and several of them being pcA is on the wrong subnet, or routerA is addressed incorrectly.


So here it is [Cheat Sheet](http://i.imgur.com/LNKrys3.jpg?1)

Yes its hand drawn, i got it down to about a minute :)


The main factor I wanted with a cheat sheet was that I only wanted to remember a very small group of things going in. I knew I was going to be nervous and I didn't want to be trying to recall to much and stumbling out of the gate.

**So to create it all I needed to know was the following:**

1)How to divide 128 by 2 then take its result and divide by 2 again. Honestly going into these exams you will know this step forwards and backwards :)

2)Take 255 and start subtracting it in reverse order 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 from it. That gives you all that jazz. ex 255 - 1 = 254...254 - 2 = 252...252 - 4 = 248...and so on

3) Fill in your 1s and 0s. You will remember how it should look.

4)Your 3 mnemonic phrase 

-All People Seem To Need Data Processing

-tcp in A TIN cup (A TIN is what you care about)

-Did Sally Pack For Bermuda

5)Powers. 

Quick Note...All of this is simple but DO NOT RUSH IT..one simple mistake in your powers table like a 1048 instead of 1024 will cause you grief. Also keep it neat as you dont want to be second guessing things on it.


**How to use it.**

This chart represents a starting point of a class C, imagine Classes B and A to the left of it, they would look the same. 

Ex1) What is the broadcast for 192.168.144.0 255.255.255.224??

-Scroll down the left hand column until you find 224 move over to the right until the last '1' in the row and lookup. You got 32, 0-32 is the range 31 is the Broadcast.

Ex2) What valid host range is the ip address 10.128.3.233/20 a part of??

-For this one you start counting from left to right from 17 (Everything 16 and less is on the imaginary chart to your left). Since a /20 falls on 16 you know the range you just need remember to exclude the first and last (10.128.0.1 and 10.128.15.254). For Class B start counting from 17, Class C start counting from 25. Itll make sense once you do it a few times.

Ex3) How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you get from the network 10.0.0.0 255.255.240.0?

-Scroll down the left hand column until you find 240 now scroll right until you hit a 0, count all the zeros in this row all the way over to the right and now since this is a Class B imagine in your head this chart extending to the right you would just keep counting (another 8 0s). So 12 0s dont do the math just look at your power chart and find 2^12 = 4096 then subtract -2 (because were looking for hosts) and blammo 4094. The same thing goes for for the subnets counts the 1s going towards the left and then look at your power table. You will get 4094.

Introduction  
&gt;First off, thanks for all the tips, tricks, and practice info submitted by the faithful redditors here. Though I've never posted, I troll /r/ccna a every day, and your thoughts definitely contributed to my passing this exam. Know this, 2 months ago my knowledge of networking was zilch. I knew absolutely nothing. This test can be overcome by people with little to no understanding in networking, it just takes practice. The advantages I had were the fact that I work Help Desk and have two very talented network engineers guiding me through the cert/learning/understanding process. Also, I had access to older Cisco routers they weren't using.

Materials and Software I used
&gt;I used Lammle's book exclusively for theory. For lab setup I bought the 841 without wireless just to familiarize myself with the CLI, then I used an image from a router at work to set up all the routing/acl/nat examples using GNS3 (you can google for an IOS image if you don't own one, though I'm not sure as to the legality there). I didn't download packet tracer until the end, and it showed in my knowledge of switching. I had to review STP, VTP, and port security an awful lot the last week before my test. The genetics lottery did bless me with a decent memory though, and I find that memory is a core component of the CCNA. Networking is a contrived concept, it is a series of standards, protocols, specifications, and software/hardware developed by human beings. It is important to recognize that a lot of things in networking were simply decided that way. My math professor used to call this the White House rule. The White House is white because it's white. Or something like that... 

Cisco commands
&gt;I recommend keeping a google doc or a notebook filled with the most vital cisco commands you come across, and commit them to memory. Know the output of show cdp neighbor and show cdp neighbor detail like the back of your hand, for the love of God. These commands allowed me to do very well on my sims. Some other common ones are:

    ip address //used frequently, assigns ip addresses to interfaces
    show ip route // good to verify your routing setup
    show run //just use this all the time, any time you're stuck
    copy run start //save your changes to nvram when you're done!

Know everything?
&gt; 
Everybody says, ""Know everything"". I didn't want to believe that was true going into the exam, but it really is. They ask you the most random assortment of questions (I mean, Frame Relay? WTF) It's ridiculous how broad this exam really is. I'm glad they're changing it, because the 640-802 covers so much. And my survey responses reflected that ;)
    
Is subnetting really that important?
&gt;As far as the most important topic to know? The obvious answer is subnetting. But most people stop right there, and may not tell you why. Lammle likes to say two things about subnetting. 1) Every question is a subnetting question, and 2) Know subnetting: know CCNA, no subnetting: no CCNA. The reason he says these things is because so many topics and, consequently, questions on the 640-802 stem from your understanding of proper IP addressing, and subnetting is at the core of IP addressing. 

Tips and tricks for subnetting?
&gt;Know them in your head, really. Don't do that binary thing unless you're absolutely stuck. Know that /28 means a mask of 255.255.255.240, has a block size of 16, and has a corresponding wildcard of 0.0.0.15. Know the difference between a wildcard and a mask. Know that the amount of usable IP addressing is block size - 2. Here's my little tip for Class B subnetting: I don't know how to explain this well, but, here goes. Ok. So say you're given the subnetwork 172.16.0.0 /20, and you want to find the last usable address in this subnet. I found the best way to do this in my head was to add 8 to the prefix-length, giving us 28. So the block size for the third octect will be the block size that would be in the fourth octet with a /28 prefix on a class C address. So the last usable IP address in the subnetwork 172.16.0.0 /20 is 172.16.15.254 (remember that the last IP address is the broadcast address. See what I did there? I added 16 to the third octect and subtracted 2 from the last octet to account for the network address of the next subnetwork and the broadcast address of this subnetwork. If that makes no sense whatsoever, and I'm sure it may not, PM and I can further explain it. I find that the best prefixes to commit to memory are /28 and /24. Know /28's block size is 16. That way, if you're asked about a /29 prefix. You just divide 16 by 2 and you have 8. Or if you're given a /27 you just multiply by 2 and you have 32. Then use your respective block sizes to find the mask. There's no reason to memorize masks, just subtract the block size of any given subnet from 256 and you'll get your mask. For instance, /28 is a block size of 16, 256 - 16 = 240, therefore the mask is 255.255.255.240. Know that wildcards are just 1 less than the block size associated with the subnet. Know that the last ip address in a subnetwork is the broadcast address. Cisco loves to test your knowledge of this by frequently applying broadcast addresses to interfaces and then ask you why it's not working. Cisco also loves to trick you up with the first IP address in a subnetwork. The first IP address is reserved for the subnetwork address, therefore it is not valid for host addressing. Why commit /24 to memory? Just so you know that is where the class c and class b subnetting is differentiated. 255.255.255.0, block size 256. Subnetting is easy, just practice it a lot, and it will come. I didn't know a thing about subnetting two weeks ago, and I didn't miss a single ip addressing question on the exam. 

Non technical related tips and tricks
&gt;If you're self studying, schedule your exam. This was the best piece of advice given to me, if I had not scheduled my exam, I would not be a CCNA right now. Also, bring two forms of ID to the test. I almost forgot to do this, I was lucky they accepted a credit card as the second form of ID.

Other thoughts
&gt;Besides knowing subnetting, you should know your weaknesses. I had two big weaknesses going into the test. 1) I didn't know switching as well as I should, and 2) I didn't know ACL's as well as I should. I recognized my weakness in these topics last week and spent a good portion of my review time studying them just to make sure I'd be ready. And it paid off, I had to apply my knowledge of ACL in a sim. You never know what Cisco will throw at you. Know your subnetting, know your weakness, study hard, study early, study often, and you'll pass the CCNA.

I taught myself.  There are many ways to go about doing that, here is what I did:

1. Started watching a video series. CBT NUggets - Jeremy Ciara
   I like CBT because the videos are all under an hour and Jeremy is a good teacher. I was not happy with TrainSignal, Chris Bryant. It is hard to explain but Jeremy makes you wish you were having as much fun as he is when he explains everything, Chris made me feel like he was as bored teaching as I was watching.  Whatever series you choose, there are others,I recommend watching a sample before you buy. 

2. Get some practice tests. I used testkingworld and it was exactly like what I saw during the real test. By taking practice tests you are ready for the types of questions asked on the exam. For example: you may be able to subnet but can you look at a network diagram with 8 devices and quickly tell which one is not on the same subnet as everything else? 

3. Home lab.  Home labs are nice but not essential to passing, IMHO. That being said, it was nice to work on real equipment and to really set up a WAN connection.  If you are going to get a lab I recommend buying one switch (2950's are like $50 on ebay) first, configure it, make VLAN's, have fun. If you feel that you need more, then buy everything else.

Here is what I would buy(ebay ebay ebay) for a complete home CCNA lab: two 2950's and three 2961's. Don't spend more than $60 on each device. ",,False,self,t5_2qjhh,False,,,True,t3_1fgfa4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/1fgfa4/how_i_self_studied_for_my_ccna_and_you_can_too/,

I felt the need to post on here as I have been reading these forums for the past month in final preparation for my test. I took the CCENT (ICND1) yesterday and passed with a scrore of 937/1000. The test was very straight forward with little intent to trick me with fancy wording. The test is difficult, but I will say I was completely prepared for it. 

My studying resouces are listed below (By priority):

1- CCENT/ICND1 Third edition. (Wendell Obom) 

2- Cisco Press Simulators that correspond with the book above (This helped me out big time)

3- ICND1 series from CBT Nuggets with Jeremy C. (This stuff is golden)

4- Packet Tracer

Guess I can put that CCNA on my resume now.
Passed the test with 944/1000. Honestly didn't feel as good on this one as the ICND1 going into it or during the test. Spent a lot of time double guessing myself. 43 questions, most of mine seemed focused on VTP, VLANs, Trunking, and ACLs. Very little OSPF, EIGRP, and routing in general. Which is funny, cause I studied the other way around.

I got really lucky and reviewed some VTP configuration notes last night that saved me today.

I used Wendell Odom's ICND2 book, GSN3, and a coworker lent me Todd Lammle's CCNA book. Borrowed a Cisco switch at work from a senior engineer to practice switch configuration, that was an insane help.

I ordered the Cisco Press books for CCNP, I actually have training at work this week for Carrier Ethernet Associate. So once I complete that I'll get back into Cisco stuff. Maybe take a week off, not positive yet.

The only part I did poorly on (50%) is the simulations, but that was only because they blocked most of the major commands. I don't understand the actual point of blocking commands like show running-config, etc.. I get the idea of them wanting you to know more commands than the standard ones... but why...

Anyways, passed. Test was a lot easier then I anticipated. Test I took was the 640-822.

I used Wendell Odom, along with Chris Bryant series.
There is a lot of subnetting involved, but now it is almost a reflex of mine. I don't even need to do math.

Today was the result of over a year worth of spending several hours a day studying for my CCNA certification using the online NetAcademy of Cisco. As my company also didn't cover any of the fees, I had to pay the entire thing including the certification exam out of my own pocket (which makes me so much more glad not having to retake it)

[](/scootaplease) The first 15-20 questions and simlets were extremely hard - I was down half of my time and I felt like I didn't do really good on those. Especially the ACL one gave me trouble - I can never quite figure out what kind of ACL Cisco wants /exactly/. Needless to say I felt like I was not going to pass it.

The questions got easier and easier towards the end though, and I was able to do the last 25 questions in about 10-15 minutes.

I couldn't believe I passed at the end, and it still feels quite unreal. I felt unprepared, especially after a friend asked me a few questions out of the ""CCNA Flash Cards and Exam Practice Pack"" he had and which I never used before. Some of the questions there were extremely deep in theory grounds and I was sure I wouldn't pass after I messed up quite a few questions with that.

[](/scootaderp-in)Yet here I am!

I think I will still get the Flash Cards pack as it successfully showed some areas in which I still feel weak.

For my future I have ambitious plans! My instructor gave me the ability to go to join a Cisco Academy of an university nearby to do my CCNA Security and my CCNP - I plan on finishing both in the course of next year.

I am actually a junior network engineer by trade, but we're an Enterasys shop, so some of the syntax I wasn't really familiar with.

To prepare, I just read Wendell Odom's (Cisco Press) ICND1 book and took notes over the course of about 2 weeks.

Advice:

- Know your CLI syntax, especially related to security.  You should be very comfortable with how to set up remote access (telnet/ssh) and secure your config.  This is an area where Enterasys equipment differs *substantially* from Cisco.

- Know CDP.  This is good advice for any network exam or situation.

- This is a given, but KNOW HOW TO SUBNET.  Every testing resource ever will tell you this, but Wendell Odom does NOT do a good job of connecting the dots on subnetting.  Odom will tell you how to do it, but doesn't provide a good context for it.

- Know your L2, L3, and L4 protocols and what they are used for.

- This is more of a general ""test taking"" tip, but applies especially to the ICND1 multiple-choice and ""choose x of the following"" questions: instead of looking for the correct answer right away, eliminate the answers that you *know* cannot possibly be true.

- Eat breakfast!

edit: One more piece of advice - go to a somewhat well-known or controlled testing facility (like a community college) if you can.  I arrived at the testing...facility (Network Technology Academy in Somerville, MA) about 20 minutes beforehand for a 9:00 AM test as recommended by Pearson Vue, and the guy who ran the business was 20 minutes late getting to his shop, so I had to start the test at 930 and stressed out the entire time about my meter running out.  He then took me to a computer lab and closed the door with no formal procedural introduction, so in theory, it was an environment where someone could've easily put a ""cheat sheet"" or test materials in their pocket or wallet and just carried it in.  The entire experience was *incredibly* unprofessional, and that's just one more thing you don't need right before you take the ICND1.

I've gotten a lot of useful information out of this subreddit so I wanted to give something back by sharing some awesome Packet Tracer labs I came across today on the Cisco Learning Network forum. It had a bunch of separate links for labs, so I download them all and made them into a .rar and uploaded them. 

These labs don't walk you through it like the ones do on the discs in the back of the CCNA Exploration books. There are instructions on what you need to do, but you are left to your own devices to figure out *how* to do it. I like this because it really tests whether you know what you're doing, and forces you to research the answer rather than explaining everything for you. There *is* a folder with the solutions in them, but I recommend against using that. I don't think that's going to help in really learning the subject.

[Here](http://www.mediafire.com/?fbzj28d36d20dn1) is the link to the labs to download; feel free to check it for viruses. If you're curious, I found them [here](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/thread/4933).

I think anyone pursuing the CCNA would benefit from these. Packet Tracer is a wonderful tool and while it might not give you hands-on experience, it's a great supplement and will suffice for the exam.

My battery on my car was dead because I left a light on last night and I had no one to give me a jump, and it was now an hour before the exam was set to begin. I was determined to take the exam today so I called a taxi. The taxi driver said he'd be at my house in 5-10 minutes, and he doesn't show up until 25 minutes later. I got to my local community college where the exam was taken and went to the wrong building. Eventually, I made it to the right place at exactly 12:00, when the exam was supposed to start. Of all the days that my battery could have died, today was the worst. Nonetheless, I was excited to take the test.

The test was pretty much what I expected. With all the hype, it was actually easier than I had expected. I scored an 899 with over 30 minutes left at the end of the test. I was worried about time throughout the exam so kept moving fast, and ended up having a bunch of time left over.

I went through the Cisco Networking Academy and finished over a year ago. I was working 52 hours a week at the time while taking 5 classes and I didn't get as much from the courses as I should have. A couple months ago I decided to start studying for the exam, having forgotten a lot of things from the courses. I used CBT Nuggets, which is amazing. Back at my community college, the teacher was boring and I became almost uninterested in computer networking. CBT Nuggets rejuvenated my interest in it; Jeremy is an awesome guy. I also used the books I had left over from the courses (4 of them) and most recently I got the Todd Lamle 640-802 book. I used packet tracer a lot. I got a couple routers and a switch from Ebay but admittedly I've only messed around on the 2950 switch so far. 

As others have said time and time again, know subnetting very well. I had a lot of questions that required you to know subnetting. I wrote a subnet chart out on my whiteboard as soon as I started the test, but I've gotten to the point where I can subnet fast enough in my head that it wasn't necessary. Either way, it's definitely a good idea to have it there; it only takes a few minutes to write it out at the beginning of the exam. I didn't write it during the tutorial because I was too afraid that I'd get in trouble for it since the actual exam hadn't started (I found that people have had mixed experiences with this depending on the location).

Good luck to anyone who plans to take the exam. Tomorrow I'll begin studying for the ICND2, which will probably require a lot more studying.

I’ve been lurking around here since I thought about getting my CCNA in Feb and I got a lot of great study advice and materials here.  

What I did to pass:

1) Booked my test.  This for me was the most important step.  Like I said above, I’ve been thinking about getting my CCNA since Feb, but I didn’t get serious until around mid-May when I booked my exam.  If you’re thinking about getting your CCENT/CCNA, do it.  Book it today.

2) Watched Jeremy’s CBT Nuggets videos.  

3) Read Odom’s CCENT/CCNA ICND 1 Prep Book, did subnetting problems from Subnettingquestions.com, and labs from subnet192.com.  The labs from subnet192.com are well-worth the 12 bucks and I plan on getting the lab book for ICND2.  

4) Did the practice tests that came with Odom’s book. These tests are quite the humbling experience.  Seriously, these practice tests were quite a bit harder than the actual exam for me.

5) Hit Wikipedia/Google and looked up any concepts I was still fuzzy on.

6) Re-watched key CBT videos (WAN Connectivity, Subnetting, etc).

7) Ate a well-balanced breakfast.

On a side note, I'm an American expat living in Japan and if anyone else is in the Kansai region, I highly recommend the WAVE Osaka-Eki Mae testing center for IT testing.  Really easy to get to from Umeda Station, English-speaking staff, and really well-run.

My CCENT expires on May 12, so I knew several months ahead of time that I needed to pass the ICND2 test before then in order to save a lot of time &amp; money studying for both tests (or the one test option.)

Here's my study path:

* Last week of January, sat in a 40-hour classroom course sponsored by my employer for ICND1.

* Last week of February, sat in a 40 hour classroom course sponsored by my employer for ICND2.

* Watched CBTNuggets over the course of the next month and a half. (Yea, slacking off.)

* Ordered [Odem's guide](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1587204355/) from Amazon, took the practice test included with the book to identify my weak areas.

I do a lot of switching stuff at work, but absolutely no routing. The practice test will break out what % of which subjects you got right. This helped tremendously by allowing me to work only on my weak spots.

Studied the book and re-took the practice tests for 3 weeks, major cramming over the past week.

Leading up to the test, I was not 100% confident in my ability to pass, but I wanted to give it a shot. If I failed today, I would have one more chance to take it before my CCENT expired on the 12th. (Because you can re-take a test on the 6th day after failing it.)

Luckily, that wasn't needed, and I passed with a 888/1000 (passing score is 825) I had about 12 minutes to spare when I finished.

Feel free to ask me any questions, I'll answer anything that I'm able to (and without breaching contract - no specifics about questions.)

My biggest piece of advice - as you may already know - is to KNOW SUBNETTING! You need to be able to find the decimal subnet mask (or CIDR prefix), network id, broadcast IP and where the next subnet starts of any IP address and mask/prefix within 20 seconds.

1363808573.0,17,self.ccna,1aol6p,Passed the ICND1 today!! 850 meh :(,18,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/1aol6p/passed_the_icnd1_today_850_meh/,"I figured I would post my experiences as I have been using this subreddit for help/info throughout my studies. I graduated college in 2010 and have since been kicking around the Odom books promising myself I would get certified. After realizing how much interest I took in networking (and reading lots of the posts in /r/networking) I finally hunkered down and took the test. 

Studying: First thing I did was read Odom's book cover to cover. I admit his materials are VERY dry and read much like a manual. The first couple times reading through his book I lost interest mid chapter and often had to reread whole sections before it started to sink in. I eventually bought a sub to the CBT nuggets videos and reach each chapter in correspondence with the CBT nuggets videos to reinforce the info. By the time I was ready for the test I could open any chapter and be able to answer the ""Do you already know this"" questions and skim the chapter and know exactly what each section referred to. 

Test: I had a somewhat unique experience with the test I hope no one has to go through, but my testing computer froze on the last question upon submitting it. I grabbed the proctor immediately and we filled out an incident report. After some nerve wracking 20 minutes she said all my answers were saved and that I would be allowed to continue with the time I had left when the test froze. As soon as we got the test back up I submitted my test without reviewing any of my answers (dumb).

Also, I don't know if due to my technical issues I didn't see the opportunity but I was never able to go back and review my answers. On other certification exams I have taken I could, from any question, hit back and return to previous questions to review. If I had a chance to review I might have been able to score higher, but again due to my technical difficulties I might have just simply missed the chance at the end of the test.

The part that killed my score were the SIM questions, I ended up studying with practice exams so thoroughly the SIM questions threw me off every time they came up. Study your show commands and if you have the time look into how the SIM questions work on the test so you aren't as thrown off as me.

ICND2 Studying: My plan is to give my brain a week of rest and schedule the ICND2 a month from now. For me it's a lot harder to procrastinate studying when I know I have the test date looming. Odom book/CBT nuggets will be how I study for the second test.

I hope my experience gives you all insight and wish you all the best of luck!!!

I little background. I've been working in tech support for a year and a half now. I have basic Tier 1 networking knowledge and have recently decided to make a push into getting my CCNA.

I recently purchased Lammle's CCNA Study Guide, I have all the CBT nuggets downloaded, and I have packet tracer (Though I don't know how to use it yet)

My question is that my local community college is offering the four course Cisco Academy program that takes you through various networking fundamentals.

I.) Network Fundamentals, Routing Protocols, Advanced Switching and LAN Switching &amp; Wireless.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone has taken any of these courses and if they're worth the cost. I'm probably looking at about at least 600 dollars a course, without the cost of reading materials.

I have and had a good grasp of networking basics but am not a Cisco guy and have had trouble organizing the volume of more advanced material. Finally making the push to dedicate time to synthesize all the info and make the final push (thanks, Sandy!!!)

I put together the following as part of my learning process. If others find it helpful I will post more as I go. Additions/corrections/criticisms welcome.

EIGRP 

-AD = 90 (External EIGRP AD = 170)
-Hybrid (Cisco defines as distance vector)
-Proprietary
-Composite Metric determines best routes - Bandwidth, Delay, Reliability, Load
-AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS (AS) organization
-Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) - Allows for backup route determination, support of VLSMs, Dynamic Route Recoveries, Queries for alternate route if no Feasible Successor can be found
-Reliable Transport Protocal (RTP) -  Proprietary, uses multicast class D address 24.0.0.10, then follows with 16 unicast attempts before declaring neighbor dead (reliable multicast)  
-Supports multiple network layer protocols via Protocol Dependent Modules (PDMs)
-Neighbor/adjacency based on:
	-Hellos received
	-AS Number Match
	-Identical K Value Metrics 
-Only advertises complete information when new neighbor is discovered and adjacency is formed via hello packet exchange
-After adjacency is formed only changes to routing table are propagated

-Topology Table - Stored in RAM, populated by PDMs, acted upon by DUAL, contains all destinations advertised by neighbors, holds each destination address, neighbors which advertised the destination and its metric.
	-Routes should show as P (Passive), which means everything is functioning normally and the path is known. A (Active) means searching for replacement route
	-Each entry indicates FD, AD and next-hop neighbor, and also includes the best Feasible Successor (backup) route  
 	Successor - Best route, stored in routing table
	Feasible Successor - Backup route, up to 16, best is viewable in topology table (in order to be a FS, AD must eq less than FD of successor)
	-Stores neighbor updates, contains all known routes from all known neighbors
	-Selects best routes and places in routing table
	-Feasible Distance (FD) - best metric, includes distance to reporting neighbor, lowest FD=Routing Table
	-Reported/Advertised Distance(AD) - Reported distance by neighbor, routing table metric of said neighbor, displayed next to FD in topology table
	-Raw material from which routes are selected

-Neighbor Table - stored in RAM, contains adjacency info including address and interface, 1 table per PDM, uses sequence #'s to match ack's with update packets
	-H field indicates order of neighbor discovery
	-Hold is how long the router will wait for a hello packet for that specific neighbor 	-Uptime is how long adjacency has been up
	-SRRT=Smooth Round-Trip timer - time for round trip to and from that neighbor (expected receipt of multicast reply, if not received, will go to unicast)
	-RTO=Retransmission Time Out - time to wait before retransmitting a packet from the retransmission queue to a neighbor
	-Q field is messages in queue, large value mean no good
	-Seq field indicated sequence number of last update from that neighbor, used to maintain synchronization 

OTHER CHARACTERISTICS/FEATURES:
-Supports large network by using multiple AS's, External EIGRP (170 AD) represents any route originated outside the AS, whether another EIGRP AS or an OSPF route, all appear the same when redistributed by EIGRP
-Supports VLSM, thus allows for summarization and discontiguous networking (not by default, like OSPF)
-Equal Cost Load Balancing on up to 4 links by default, 16 if the maximum-paths command is used
-variance command allows unequal cost load-balancing (1=equal cost, 2= 2 lt or eq to 2x successor route)
-Default hop count of 100, up to 255 if the metric maximum-hops command is used
-Routes in routing table market with D designation for DUAL


MAJOR CONFIGURATION COMMANDS:
Router{config}#router eigrp [AS#1-65535]
Router{config-router}#network [network #]
Router{config-router}#passive-interface [interface] - sets and interface to passive, means EIGRP will not work, (no hellos, no adjacencies)
Router{config-router}#no auto-summary - turns of auto-summarization, allows support for discontiguous networks
Router{config-router}#maximum-paths [1-16] - allows load balancing across up to 16 links, default 4
Router{config-router}#metric maximum-hops [1-255] - allows hop count increase or decrease, default 100

TROUBLESHOOTING COMMANDS:
show ip route - Shows whole routing table
show ip protocols - Shows routing protocols configuration (AS#s and Metric Weights [K-values], also hop count and variance [load balancing])
show ip route eigrp - Shows EIGRP routes only
show ip eigrp neighbors - Shows all EIGRP neighbors (neighbor table)
show ip eigrp topology - Shows entries in topology table
debug eigrp packet- Shows hello packets sent/received between adjacent routers
debug ip eigrp events - Shows EIGRP updates in real time

Overall  the exam was way easier than I expected from reading the prep materials. Here is what happened on the test (ymmv):  
  
-TONS of subnetting questions and questions that required subnetting - be quick on these.  
-Dispiste the description of materials covered by the new ICND1 there were no mention of OSPF or routing protocols at all on the test  
-Nary a mention of ipv6 despite my study (i was disappointed really).  
-More than a few quesstions that simply required knowledge of what  happens to mac addresses as they get forwareded thru network.  
-Static routing  
-Basic security stuff - like how to encrypt passwords protect telnet etc.  
-Some very general NAT questions.   
-very basic yet trickily worded questions about access lists (know your extended lists too)

it seems that there are 2 strategies those of us who are studying now could use to deal with this. 

But neither strategy sounds ideal to me: 

________

1) RUSH TO DO EXAMS? 

In the first strategy we could just rush and try to do the current 2 CCNA exams now, since that's what we're studying for now (and spending all our free time, energy and money getting ready for).

But the problem I see with that approach, is that I would be short changing myself with important networking knowledge. 

Obviously if Cisco is going to change the exam, they must feel this new knowledge is important!

So if I rush to do the current exams, then I'll be missing out on that new knowledge. 

Also ""rushing"" through the knowledge and studying process now, just so that I can take the current exams, might mean that I come away with a less deep overall understanding of the material. 


________


2) DELAY AND WAIT FOR NEW MATERIAL? 

So instead of killing ourselves, and rushing rapidly through the current study material, we could just wait for the new material to come out. 

But ""delaying"" and ""waiting"" and waffling too much is usually never a good approach to accomplishing important life goals! 

So while I do want to take my time to properly absorb and learn the material (and also learn the new exam material) I also don't want to go to the other extreme of delaying things too far into the future. 


________



3) ANOTHER PROBLEM:

Finally... another problem with ""waiting"" and ""delaying"" is that we don't know how long it will take for authors, writers, and course-curriculum planners, to come up with new material that covers the new exam in a very good way. 

So for example if I say, ""Ok, I'll wait for the new material,"" and Cisco announces their changes in the summer, but it takes authors and curriculum planners until the fall/end of the year to adequately cover the changes, then I've put off my dreams/future for yet another year! 


________


CONCLUSION:
It's never an easy thing to get caught in the middle of a transition like this. 

It kinda sucks, and it's frustrating! 

But at some point Cisco has to update the exam, in order for the Cisco certifications to remain valuable. (But it just sucks getting caught in that transition.)

I think the only strategy I can really use is just to keep pushing forward, by learning the knowledge in all the CCNA books I bought now, absorb that knowledge in a deep and meaningful way (so I can become a great networking professional) and then take it one day at a time.

Everything I have read with extended named ACLs shows the syntax that source address is listed first and destination address is listed second. On my switch, the ACLs are all applied at the vlan interface as inbound rule, but it appears the source/destination is flipped. 

I wanted to create a rule that would allow VLAN3 (192.168.1.0/24) to connect to a single host on VLAN2 (192.168.0.2) over port 80. My thinking is that I would need to show a source address of 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 and a destination of 192.168.0.2. However, when i went to apply the rules, it would only work if I flipped the entries. I'm curious as to why this is? I cannot seem to find documentation on it.  

I thought this would work:

    10 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.0.2 eq www

However, this does not work. It does work, however when i enter the following:

    10 permit tcp host 192.168.0.2 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 eq www

I'm curious why this is. The direction of all ACLs edited are inbound, and applied at the destination vlan.

2. RouterA sends a triggered update to RouterB for the failed route with a metric of 16
3. RouterB updates its routing table for the failed route
4. RouterB suspends it's split horizon rules and sends a triggered update back to RouterA
5. RouterA updates its routing table for the failed route
6. The route is removed from both routers once there respective timers expire

Writing down those steps has given me a thought:

Is split hoizon with poison reverse useful to account for the fact that RouterA has removed the failed route from it's routing table thereby exposing it to a routing update from say RouterC which would have a route to the failed route? So the poison reverse is to make sure the RouterA has a metric 16 entry in it's routing table as soon as possible? But then again RouterC would also have received a triggered update so wouldn't have any reason to advertise the route...

Since there's not really an active CCNA: DC subreddit, I wanted to give you all my impression of the first part of the two exams.  I passed today with a 968/1000 (818 to pass.)  The 640-911 is very basic stuff for the most part.  If you guys have your CCENT, it's worth looking into.  A few questions about MDS's and Nexus 5k/7k devices and most of the rest of the material covered is straightforward CCNA-level stuff.  I found the questions to be written more concise and easier to comprehend.  

For study material, it was mostly previous knowledge from the past CCNA and I went through the objectives listed [here](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/docs/DOC-16160).  Since there is no official book out, I went through the objectives and read about them in my past book and googled the concepts I was weak on.

I apologize and walk over to pick it and the papers up.  I place them onto the counter and I look down.  As I went to grab the filer, it cut my hand, except this was no minor paper cut.

I had 2 questions on wireless, and about 3 on WAN stuff.  The rest was SUBNETTING and application thereof, along with about 3 simple discovery simlets.

After a long battle on wait-list with my local community college's semester long CCNA prep course I finally got in. I'm extremely excited to begin. We have 4 hours a week in class on Wednesdays + tons of online work + I work full-time + I also go to school full-time.

Do you think that will increase my chances at all at getting a new job once I get my CCNA? 11$/hr is a little rough to live on right now. 

Our CIO said he would be willing to have the guys get me some hands on experience on equipment and what not while I take the course, but at the end of the day it largely depends on whether or not they have time or if it is convenient for them or not (it is often not).

I hated the help desk politics of being held personally responsible when the users found out something they weren't supposed to know about something being down and it was supposed to be secret, but I looked at the rest of the IT dept. and they were all stressed, over weight, and depressed, and I didn't see anywhere I actually wanted to go (their network guy had actually just left to go to another position).

Is CCNA the best cert to try and get a foot in networking basics like deployments, or do those not usually require CCNA?  Also, I've already put in my two weeks notice and left the employer I mentioned.  The burnout and antagonizing over frying over politics ate at me to the point where I couldn't see a future in IT at all, I just hated it all.

Here is how I did it,14,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/1cjn43/just_passed_icnd1_this_morning_here_is_how_i_did/,"I decided I wanted to start the Cisco track in early March of this year. It took me a month and a half of study. It could have been less, but I was busy at some points(at one point I went 5 days straight without study). 

This is all for the 640-822 exam, which you still have plenty of time to study for and take, including the ICND2.

These are the materials I used:

1. CBTNuggets video series for ICND1 - If you are just starting out and want to firmly grasp the concept of what a network is and how it works, this is a GREAT resource. I feel like these videos should be required for anyone taking the exam. Jeremy explains everything in an easy-to-learn format. I was not bored watching the videos. I will say that the videos did not cover enough of what is in the exam (BY FAR). 

2. Wendell Odom's ICND1 book [click here for link to buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/CCENT-ICND1-640-822-Official-Edition/dp/1587204258/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366219367&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=wendell+odom) - This book covers all the material you need. This is a great book for study and one of the main reasons is, the practice exams on the included DVD! These questions really test your knowledge of the material to make sure you really know what you are doing. If you are making passing grades on these exams, you should be in good shape for the real thing!

3. www.subnettingquestions.com - This was used to practice my subnetting until I got it down with ease. 

4. [some packet tracer lab simulations](http://www.packettracernetwork.com/packettracer53labs.html) this is to test your knowledge on CLI commands and configurations.

I also want to thank everyone in here for the advice I got, answered questions, and also for everyone's posts. I was in here checking things daily!!

I will say to KNOW your subnetting and your show commands(the command and an understanding of what it shows) for the exam! I cannot stress that enough.

Time to celebrate, then onto ICND2!!

However, when I connect a PC on the farthest end of the link and attempt to tracert the router on the other end, I'm unable to reach the device.  After a few more tests, I find out I'm able to ping the interface on the router that connects to the far end router once every 6 pings.  Any idea as to why these requests keep timing out? Is it due to some default configuration I'm unaware of or is this being caused by the limitations of packet tracer itself?

Edit: After taking trying out EukaryoteZ suggestion, it looks like the ICMP packets were going back through the port they arrived in with default routes set, which was the cause of the dropped packets.  I gave up using packet tracer, and decided to dip my toes back into GNS3.  Using default routes lead to the same effect, so I just put all routers on the same EIGRP AS with network 0.0.0.0 and things started to work the way I wanted.

I tried various online (reputable) practice tests and found I just need to review a few things (like fiber connector types, distances) but other than that it was rather straight forward.

Two questions, if anyone with experience with both Network+ and CCNA has any insight:

* I was surprised by a lack of subnetting questions on the practice questions, they didn't really go much farther than identifying IP classes. I can do the practice sections on http://www.subnetskills.com/ in my head with pretty high accuracy so I'm not concerned about subnetting tasks, but is it correct to assume the ICND1 will have more comprehensive questions for this?
* What would you recommend I spend time on before taking the ICND1 exam, assuming I do score high on the Network+ exam Tuesday, and my subnetting is already pretty solid? (And I do have some experience with a fairly simple new Cisco router deployment/configuration.)


*TL;DR* - Subnetting: No problem. Network+: No problem. IOS: Some IRL Experience. What are my hurdles for passing ICND1?

**The answer**
I was still a bit confused. In good old regular NAT that I'm used to at home, my router's inside global address is whatever happens to be on it's outside interface. In dynamic NAT, I guess your ISP just routes in your direction whatever bunch of ip's it's assigned to you.

CBT Nuggets, good for subnetting (the tricks) and in general a good run through. You will be hard-pressed to get any detailed information out of these. Good for subnetting and a quick go through. I played them in WMP with playspeed at 2X. LOL!


Trainsignal. I feel this is good for everything else other than subnetting. Pay good attention. Detailed and helpful



INE. Good, but the instructor does drag some topics from time to time. I came thru this at the very last moment and did not have the patience to go through the whole series. These videos, especially the switching (VLAN, SPT) are very detailed.

9TUT. You could study all you want with those videos, but if you really want to know how and what would be there on your exams, this is the place to be. No questions asked. Hands down the best material, when you have about 1 week left for your exam. They have users regularly updating what was there on the exam. The content is good, but I think you should go through some of the comments on each topic. Might help you, might also clear some of your doubts


Books. HAHA - None. 

Practice. GNS3 and Packet Tracer. GNS3 for everything but Spanning tree. For Spanning tree I had no option but PT. 

Some hints I can give are

. shortcut for commands are quick and most of them worked in the simulations, but there are questions that ask, what command can do this - I got burnt in a few such questions.

. learn the cbt subnetting method. very easy. Also I used to spend 1 hr couple of times a week here http://www.subnettingquestions.com/ Very helpful. I can subnet/answer a question in under 15 seconds. 

. do not forget the routing metrics and how the routing protocols calculate routes. There was an EIGRP question that dealt with metrics. I saw it on 9tut, but was not thorough on the workings, cost me there.



Mostly folks, just relax. Its not the end of the world. $295, I know, its not a small amount but I went prepared, that the 300 I am paying was for the experience, pass or fail. 

I hope this helps some of you. I definitly do not remember all the questions, but again, I urge you to go thru 9tut. I'm now moving on to CCNP.

I was able to figure out the IP addresses just based on the network diagrams. So, I thought I would just have to telnet into each router from the console and use the show commands to find the answers. But when I tried to telnet, it gave me an ""invalid input"" at the IP address.

I'm thinking that prices for access are probably going to end up, for ease of management, at $10 for the switch rack, and $7.50 for the CCNA rack, for an entire 23 hour period, instead of 5.5 hour blocks, as I originally intended.

The CCNA rack will still have 3x 1841's, and 3x3550's, the Switch rack, 2 x 3560's, 2x 3550's, 3 x 1841's, and 2 x 2611's. They will be run from a 2509 terminal server, which is menu driven. The CCNA rack will have TFTP access to a server, where you will be able to upgrade/downgrade one of the routers IOS, and save configs to the server for later use. The Switch rack will also have the same config saving ability. The switch rack, also has the remote ip power reboot function available, and the CCNA rack will soon.

Before the first person goes there, this is not anything you can't do yourself, but the equipment available here is pricey, and the setup to make it this easy to use, is time consuming, so if you want to just study, this will be available shortly as soon as it's locked down a bit better. I'm not out to make a mint, but am here using this as a commercial entity, and so, will be trying to provide the best service possible. There is a appointment-taking system already set up. If anyone is interested in being part of a short Beta, for the CCNA rack, let me know, either here, or on my Blog.

If you want to go your own way, there is a good amount of info on my blog to help get you there, and my racks are available on E-bay, but are not budget, by any means. I may be building some budget systems, in the $500 range with the same philosophy, coming with a terminal server and fully configured like the more expensive ones.

I have had Odom's books for over 2 years with the intention of getting my CCNA and finally today realized that goal. Enough about here here's my inputs;

Study: As I did with the ICND1 I used a combination of Odom's book and CBT nuggets. Typically reading the chapter then watching the corresponding video. I did poorly on the SIM's in ICND1 so I got into a habit of having packet tracer open during the videos and going through same configurations are Jeremy. This helped me remember command syntax and really understand what he was trying to do while keeping me interested in the video. Finally, I found that Odom's book will cover topics, in depth, which might not be pertinent for the test. Make sure you review exam topics prior to your final study/cram so you don't waste time memorizing materials you won't be tested on.

Test: On the ICND1 I scored a 850, I felt very confident during the test and was surprised by the score at the end. On the ICND2 I went in feeling more confident, but found myself panicking (again) because I got ALL of my SIM's during the first few questions. Take your time with the SIM's there are LOTS of gotcha's but if you are meticulous and feel confident in the CLI no one should have any major trouble (remember the ? is always available and tab DOES complete your commands). 

Beyond: I am at a cross-roads of what my next certification will be. I would love to jump into the VCP but I hear the class is insanely expensive ($3k?) so i'm deciding between the CCNA Voice and the new MCSA 2012.

1367614384.0,11,self.ccna,1dn45n,"Just passed 640-822 (CCENT). Here's what worked for me, and what didn't.",19,8,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/1dn45n/just_passed_640822_ccent_heres_what_worked_for_me/,"I passed the test with 887/100, with a required pass of 804.  I failed the test 3 years ago, but recently got my shit together and decided to try again.  

Here's what I did 3 years ago:

- Took a course at a local university designed to prepare for the test.  I didn't find it terribly helpful, and I think the router simulations would do just as much to teach the material as classroom time would.  If you're really new to this stuff, though, it would probably be a good bet to get you started.

- Read the chapters of the Lammle combined CCNA book that I thought pertained to the 822 exam: not easy.  There's a lot of detail in that book that's not required for this exam but is useful to know and helps toward the ultimate goal of CCNA.  The book itself is very well written, has great examples, and is thoroughly fact-checked.  9/10 would recommend. 

- Failed with a 690/1000.  

Here's where I feel the need to explain my mistake.  I pretty much gave up.  I read the Lammle book half-heartedly again over the next few years, but when it's over such a long time period, you forget the material.  It was bad and I felt bad.

I use Cisco switches at work (network admin), and that helps with the IOS familiarity, but not the random trivia pertaining to Frame Relay and coaxial token ring museum exhibits.  

So then 2 weeks ago I was like 'god damn it this is killing me'.  I did the following to prepare for the test, all of which accomplished in 1 week while working (studying evenings and weekends):

- I got a book out of the library - the CCENT Walker and Walker book.  The material was a review, but really helped concisely reinforce the necessary testable topics.  I had [problems](http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/1dcs6l/avoid_the_book_ccent_study_guide_by_walker_and/) with that book so I wouldn't recommend it on its own.  As a concise review, however, it was fine. For my situation it was 7/10, for the general CCENT candidate, however, I would rate it as 5/10.

- I read that sucker cover to cover.  Did all the tests: got about 11-13/15 on them - not great. 

- I got the [certified4less](http://www.getcertified4less.com/) exam voucher + practice test combo, and did all of the practice exams.  That helped because the explanations are fairly good when you get a problem wrong.  And really, what else is there to do once you've read the material and practiced the commands?  That being said, I had problems with the Transcender material.  For one thing, there's a bunch of stuff they don't tell you.  You need Windows, for one thing.  The core product is a Windows installer into which you load the test pack, all downloaded from the site.  There's a web module, but it requires - get this - Internet Explorer.  The flash cards are difficult to use, the interface is very poorly designed, and it feels like a Soviet-era product coded by minimum wage drones in a Mumbai slum.  I haven't even gotten to the content.  Several test questions contain glaring grammatical errors, confusing wording, or are simply incomprehensible.  There's one test question, for which there are two almost-identical answers: *interface_type interface_number* and *interface-type interface-number*.  Pick the wrong one, and that's a wrong answer.  It's not even a matter of command syntax; it's a publishing placeholder!  My average over the 4 tests was 74%.  Refer to my grade on the real test (887/1000) and you'll see how representative the Transcender practice tests are.  Oh, I didn't tell you there are only 4 tests?  4/10 would not recommend.

I'm currently trying to obtain my CCNA-ICND1 cert and have a couple of questions regarding my preparation process.
  
 Age:21 |
 Previous Experiences with Networking: None |
 Certificates: A+ |
 Method of studying: Self teach
 
1. I currently have the Boson CCENT Guide (Matt Walker/Angela Walker) and the Cisco Official CCNA-ICND1 guide (Wendell ODOM). If I just study off of these two textbooks, will my knowledge suffice to pass the exam? If not, what else should I look into to better prepare myself?
2. What hardware (if any) do I need to practice with for the CCNA-ICND1 test?
3. I was looking at a Net+ textbook, and it seemed to go into a lot more depth than my CCNA textbooks. For example, the Net+ textbook explained each field of the internet header, while both my CCNA textbooks just showed me a diagram and didn't bother explaining it. Should I concern my self with the details the Net+ textbook offers?
4. Any tips and tricks you found that helped you save time and/or improve efficiency during your study process?

 
Thank you to all who took their time to read my post, and extra gratitude to those who answers my questions! Have an excellent day.

I have even had it just ""click"", only to come back later to forget how I understood it. I have searched many forums and this sub to gain some perspective on how to understand this, and at times I have found the solution that best helps me, but it is usually buried within other posts and hard to find. I figured I would make a post, not only for everyone, but for myself in case I forget this again in the future. I will try to make this as simple as I can, because a lot of times I get confused with explanations from people who understand this completely. 

Simply put, *Remember The Block Sizes!!* 

What I mean by this is if you remember the block sizes, you can easily determine what subnet a particular IP address belongs in. 

Example:

Say you have a /21 CIDR netmask. What this means is that the first two octets are all turned on (255.255.) and the third octet is where you will be concentrating on figuring out the subnet. 
 
The first two octets will take up 16 bits, leaving you with 5 more bits to turn on to complete the mask (16 + 5 = 21). 
 
So you take those 5 bits and use the subnet cheat sheet (you should remember at least this part in your head) to determine the Block Size. 
 
Mask Bits: 128  64  32  16  **8**  4  2  1

Our Bits:     1    2    3   4   **5**
 
Now, this means that our subnet will increase in a Block Size of 8. So you can start from 0 and count up in multiples of 8...until you get to the range that your target IP falls into. Be mindful not to go past that range, or you are incorrect. 
 
Let's look at an example again:
 
192.168.127.60 /21
 
=
 
255.255.248.0
 
So, now that you know the Block Size is 8, so we begin counting:
 
0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, **120, 128**.....
 
Notice that our target IP of 127 falls into the range of 120-128. 
 
The first number (120) is your Network ID, because it is the first number that fits into that range, and the last number (128) is the beginning of the next network. So your Broadcast IP is one less than the next network (127.255). Your last host would be two less than the next sub network (127.254)
 
BAM! That's it! That is the EASIEST way to understand subnetting in your head. There are many other ways to understand this, and no one is incorrect. People learn different ways, and this way worked the best for me. 
 
Another tip to consider is memorizing the block size increments, such as:

240 mask: 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, etc.

248 mask: 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128, etc.

(Credit to /u/getonthebag ) 

You should also memorize the most common subnet masks for quick recall. There are only a handful of masks that are used commonly, so memorizing those will help you out greatly: 


128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252, 253, 255


One more thing, when presented with a CIDR notation, you must remember that the CIDR does not equal exactly one netmask, that is because there are multiple octets. See [THIS](https://kb.wisc.edu/ns/page.php?id=3493) link for more information on this.

It really is coming. I have built a menu-driven access server, and at this point am only waiting on some AUI Tranceivers for the 2509's. I tried with a remote breakout router, but it causes issues with reverse telnet when getting back to the terminal services menu from the remote device. This was more for security than anything. I may attempt to provide the security via TACACS+ instead. Something I need to learn anyway.

Anyway the question here is, once again if people are interested at $5 - $7.50 per day, and also, since it looks like I'll be able to get two up and running(in addition to the CCNP R/S rack @ $10 day), what would peoples request be for configuration? 

It was my intention to run one as a R&amp;S rack, but the second is up for comment. I'd either make it a dual R&amp;S and Security(ASA5505), or a Wireless(WLC2106), or a Voice rack(CME 8.6,CUCM, Unity). Eventually, it could have all three. Because I'm a geek, when the voice rack goes in, it will have remote access to a camera to view the phone screens (probably two 7960's.)


for those of you that would like to do it yourself, here is a simple menu for access:

I am currently studying for the ICNDs and have been using the Boson BEE mock exams to practice, however, I am having problems making sense of this ostensibly straightforward question..

A router has been configured with the 'password exsim', 'enable password cisco' and 'enable secret boson' commands. The 'login' command has not been issued. 

Which of the following passwords can be used to log in to the router?

a) both boson and cisco
b) only boson
c) only cisco
d) boson, cisco and exsim

To my understanding (and after testing in a lab) it is absolutely possible to log onto this router (albeit only to user mode) via a console cable without being prompted for a password. However, the 'correct' answer is apparently 'only boson'. 

Am I misunderstanding the term 'log in' or am I not truly logged in until I have reached privileged level?

Or perhaps I have misunderstood exactly what the 'enable secret' command is doing?

Thanks very much for reading, I would post this in the Cisco forums but I dont think they like Boson being mentioned over there.",,False,self,t5_2qjhh,False,,,True,t3_1h8z78,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/1h8z78/misunderstanding_regarding_the_enable_secret/,

I'm working on setting up a CCNA lab at home. The problem I'm running into is that test machines behind my cisco router (which is behind my home router) cannot ping out to the internet, but the cisco router can. If I run NAT on the cisco router everything works, but I feel like I shouldn't need NAT. Am I wrong? Details below:

Diagram: http://i.imgur.com/yZz8PlC.png

My home network consists of a Actiontec MI424WR router, that has a 172.16.0.0/16 network space (router is 172.16.0.1).

My CCNA lab consists currently of a Cisco 3825 router, and two Cisco 3548 XL switches. The cisco router is plugged into the Actiontec router with the address 172.16.100.1, and has a gateway of last resort set like so:

    ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.0.1
The router can now send and recieve pings to google's DNS server at 8.8.8.8.

Now on the second router interface I have my internal CCNA lab network of 192.168.1.0/24. I have added a static route from my home actiontec router to point toward this network, and all machines on the home network of 172.16.0.0/16 can ping machines on the 192.168.1.0/24 network. However, none of the machines in 192.168.1.0/24 can ping out to the internet.

If I configure NAT on the cisco router, I'm able to have machines in the 192.168.1.0/24 ping out to the internet, but I feel like this should work without the need for NAT.

I was made redundant as of Friday which really sucks! As it happens my exams for CCNA 2 (in London) start on Monday so at least I have a week to study without distraction. 

I have a degree in Comp Sci from many years ago that I never used, I'm doing the CCNA to get into the industry but without any real experiences PLUS (assuming I pass my exam on Monday), the fact that I will only have completed half of my course; final exams for ccna 3 &amp; 4 are in Oct and Dec respectively. 

My question is this - how likely is it that an employer will hire me with only half my course done? Or do I have to find bar work and wait until after I get my full cert. before I can seriously look for an IT job? My ideal would be to work in a data center.

&gt; ·         Configure US-PC2 with the last IP address in the US-R2 subnet.

&gt; ·         Configure the Fa0/1 interface on US-R1 with the last IP address in the subnet.

i figure i'd use the last address in the fa0/0 for US-R2 so i think pc2's IP would be ""192.168.20.95 | 255.255.255.224""

but i have NO idea what to put for fa0/1 in the US-R1 topology.

I'm literally at the very beginning, but I'm willing to learn as much as I can!

The company I work for are moving office within the next 3 weeks to a new building that supplies internet &amp; a network already within the building.  The idea behind it is you come in and you can plug your computer into the Ethernet point on the wall and you are ready to work away.

Our current setup is something like this...

fibre router --&gt; apple airport --&gt; 24 port switch --&gt; 22 devices then connected to this

the 22 devices would be:

- 8 Cisco VOIP Phones (these plug-in to the network point on the wall, then there is an Ethernet cable that goes from the phone to 8 of the computers)
- 2 Network Printers
- 1 MAC Mini File Server
- 1 Backup Server
- 5 MACS
- 5 PCS

So in the new place we are basically going to be creating a private network within the overall network.

As far as I'm aware the new building has a patch panel room which then distributes the internet all over the building.

I'm going to take a guess that for us to create a private network in the network we will need to have a router off their patch panel into a switch which we will then plug-in all of our own devices some of which will have static ips and some which will be supplied via DHCP.  We will have be given an IP which has a different host? so that no one else can access our computers/servers.

Is this correct? Is my theory behind this correct? Terminology may be a bit rough lol

What is the difference, and why is one used sometimes and the other used other times?


-  In my first example, with the subinterfaces, how do you decide which physical interface to pick when creating your subinterface?  If you have multiple physical ports that will all use that VLAN, for instance, which interface should you use to create your subint and why?

At each site I would like to place a VM server that is on the same subnet. Sounds like a VLAN, and that's true, that's what I've created, network 192.168.3.0. However each server has the gateway address of the router connected to each switch.

Is it possible to have PC's at separate sites to have the same gateway information, this way I can move virtual images (read Mail and Web servers) without having to change their network configuration.

I get a little confused with routing though, discontiguous networks always threw me a little. If network 192.168.3.0 is being advertised by both routers, then it wont work?

Is there any way I can get this working? I'd rather not have to use NAT.

This may be incoherent and I'm happy to answer any questions if they help!

What about this: I have a spare fiber patch panel and cabling, if I order two Fiber Transceivers (each switch has spare slots for them) and directly connect them, trunk it, then only allow VLAN 3 across that trunk?

2 switches connected via crossover, one configured for VLAN 10 on all ports and the other VLAN 20 on all ports,
    
Host at each end,
    
Hosts will be able to communicate if they're on the same IP network,

Is there anything in particular you think I should pay more attention to? Or any tips for the test tomorrow? I am pretty good at subnetting, but I think I will write down the multiples of 16 and 8 on the whiteboard tomorrow because I have trouble remembering them in my head when I'm subnetting. I am going to review more stuff tonight after class to prepare for tomorrow.

So a few years back I took a class and passed my ICND1 exam. Immediately after that, I went on to an ICND2 course, but made the terrible mistake of not taking my ICND2 exam. I kept putting it off and now it's almost three years later and my CCENT is about to expire. I started hitting the books again, but I'm getting pretty low on time (I *really* slacked off on this).

Anyways, I have two options: I can re-certify for CCENT and then focus on ICND2, or I can study both and take the comprehensive exam. It seems to me that it would be easier to take the comp. exam, but if I take the time to study both ICND1 and ICND2 I think my certification will expire on me. Should I re-certify CCENT and take the two exams, or would it be better for me to take the comp exam even though my certification will lapse for a month or so?

(any suggestions regarding the aforementioned is appreciated)

I'd really like to get into wireless, is the CWNA a good next step to take inorder to climb the ladder so to speak? I've heard it's more comprehensive than the CCNAW. My current plan is to land any kind of networking job to get accustomed to the field a bit more, and while I'm working I'd be studying for the CWNA.

Would the CCNP benefit me a great deal if I want to focus on wireless, the two certainly overlap but to what degree I'm not sure.

So my question is why would I use 172.20.250.0/23 and not 172.20.251.0/23?  I believe this is because binary representation of 172.20.251.0/23 in the third (important) octet is 1111101|1 which would give a network address of 1111101|0 or 172.20.250.0/23.  **Am I looking at this correctly?**

**Second question:**

On the CCNA Discovery exams multiple answer questions received partial credit if part of the answer given was correct.  On the practice exams I have from Pearson IT (The ones that come with the 640-802 Odom books) they are marked completely incorrect even if part is correct.  Is this the same on the CCNA exam?

**Final question:** 

In CCNA Discovery exams multiple answer questions would have the additional instruction of ""Choose Two"" or ""Choose all that apply"" or ""Choose 3.""  On the Odom/Pearson IT practice exams there is no additional instruction for these questions.  How is it formatted on the CCNA exam?  

Yes I am taking the 640-802 not the 640-816/640-822 and yes I will be taking them before September 30th.

For example:

::1 is the abbreviated notation for the loopback address
0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
:: is the abbreviated notation for the unspecified address
0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000

It's pretty clear to me the the 0's are always going to be 0's in a loopback address and unspecified address but with other address types you have ranges and I'm unsure of what the ranges are and what ranges will be tested.

So for example Multicast high order bits are FF (1111 1111) and I take that to mean the Multicast range is from:

FF00:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001-
FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF

First off I would like to mention that I know there's more than a few threads on this topic but I feel like they don't really cover my exact questions and concerns. I have a few questions and concerns regarding Cisco Lab Kits. I really want to look into purchasing a few routers and switches but I would like your advice on a few areas. I've looked at a few devices on Ebay, Amazon, etc.. but I just don't think that you really get what you see. Some of the pictures aren't even of the actual switch, jut a generic picture of a brand new 2960. I want to know exactly what I'm buying before I hit that purchase button.

If you guys have any advice for me when it comes to purchasing router/switches, please let me know. Also, if you know of a good site to buy these devices, it would help out a ton.

We had another networking group that did the major work like maintaining firewalls, VPN access, data center work, and major network architecture. Due to some organizational changes we are now working closely with our other networking group and management has agreed to send us to training. They don't care if we get the certs but I'd like to get my self lined up to take the exams soon. I know cisco is changing some of their certification tracks so I am not sure how it will work out.

The CCENT 640-822 ICND1 is not available after Sept 30th. How much different will the new exam be? Have training materials been made available yet? Are online training sites updating their courses?

If I were to take the older ICND1 exam before sept 30th and pass would I be able to take the new second test for the CCNA? Would I have a hard time with it if I didnt take the ICND v2.0 exam?

I think I have a great opportunity as they are planning on sending me to a course ever 3-4 months all the way up to CCNP level courses for routing, switching, and security so I really want to put myself in the best position possible to take advantage of the opportunity.

Trying to make the decision, TODAY if I am ready, or whether I should reschedule. I am starting to get the jitters guys! I am starting to realize just HOW MUCH you need to know/remember for this exam, especially the composite, and having my doubts about being able to pass.
This is what I have covered:    
1) Basic TCP/IP &amp; Ethernet, OSI Model - I feel proficient with this, as well as what layers of the OSI model do what, using OSI for troubleshooting, etc. I know common port numbers, and the components of a network    
2) Familiar with Switching, the methods, the process, broadcast domains, hierarchical model of switching, VTP, VLANS, and I have hammered into my head STP (root elections, port states, etc. This one was complicated. I'm dreading STP questions on the test) I do know RSTP, PVST, and have done lab upon lab for STP. Still feel intimidated by it. I am comfortable with port security.     
3) Comfortable with DHCP and DNS. I have worked with these services extensively and have multiple DHCP servers and 1 BIND9 DNS server on my network    
4) Pretty OK with IPv6. I know the types of addresses, and some of the fundamentals. Started working with core concepts such as EUI-64, DPD, Neighbor Discovery, etc. today. Hitting IPv6 hard currently, but am still unsure how much of it will be on the EXAM. Have built multi-area OSPFv3 network over Frame Relay using Link Local addresses in my Dynamips Lab at least once.      
5) I feel like I could do frame relay in my sleep. I've built my frame relay cloud (including frame relay switch) at least 10 times throughout the course of setting up my Dynamips VM, having it crash or accidentally deleting it. I've set it up for IPv4 and IPv6 with multiple frame mappings and routes.     
6) Familiar with RIPv2 and loop prevention mechanisms.      
7) Familiar with OSPF and I have run multiple area OSPF in my home lab between sites with GRE tunnels. I feel pretty darn comfortable with OSPF. Know the defaults and differences between hello and dead timers.    
8) I know the basics of EIGRP. I don't use it much because I am in a multi-vendor environment lab at home. I know the parameters for neighbor relationships, multicast address, differences in tables, successors, etc. I still feel fuzzy on this simply because I have not used it as intimately as OSPF.       
9) I have access lists and WAN links to review yet! Those are two HUGE topics for TWO WEEKS. I would like to do practice tests for a while just so I can re-familiarize myself with how Cisco asks questions etc.     

**TL;DR** I really don't know if I am ready for this. How does one know, and do you have any advice? Two weeks left, do I still have time to reschedule?

1346780693.0,8,self.ccna,zcga4,Why taking the CCNA and failing is not a bad idea.,9,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/zcga4/why_taking_the_ccna_and_failing_is_not_a_bad_idea/,"A lot of people I tutor informally, from the NOC technicians here at my current employer, to friends and co-workers who are supplementing a Red Hat or Microsoft certification with a CCNA to make themselves more attractive on the job market, or they are taking additional duties and need additional understanding of network technology seem afraid, on some level to even attempt the test. Due to this I have started recommending that hopeful CCNAs take the test before they think they are ready. I think the $300 investment into the test is well worth it, and in the long run will save you a lot of time. Here is why:

**TIME SAVINGS**  

Taking the CCNA and failing will give you an excellent picture of what you can improve and what you already know. This will help you prioritize your hours when you study, such at switching? Spend time on that. Got busted doing the NAT Lab question? Do similar labs 20 times. Taking too long doing subnetting? Learn how to make yourself faster.  

**MONEY SAVINGS** 

On of my NOC guys spend $500 to $1000 on routers, despite the fact that he is pretty much the best route guy in the NOC. I viewed it as a waste of money as he could easily do any route lab that comes up, but he still thinks a spanning-tree involves leaves. When he gave the test his first go, the Layer 2 stuff caught him off guard, especially the early Layer 2 lab, and it threw him for the rest of the test, by eating up too much time and shaking his confidence. Had he taken the test, I think he could have spend less money to acquire gear to help him pass what he was weak at. 

**YOU GET TO LEARN THE TEST** 

The test is weird, its not like other tests, and it can vary greatly buy what testing center you choose (I recommend that people near where I live drive about 40 minutes to a better environment). Many people can actually get intimidated by the environment, causing them to do slightly worse than expected. Do bring foam earplugs, some places have them to hand out, other locations don't mind if you have them STILL IN THE WRAPPER. This will help you keep your focus if you are easily distracted by noise. 

**YOU DO NEED TO FAIL WELL**  

Bring a notepad with you, when you are done with the test, get your stuff, including the notepad and write down everything that was a problem, as much as you can. Write down as much as you can remember about the lab questions, and what was easy or hard about them. 

Note your weaknesses, and focus on those. You get a handy test sheet which tells you what you did well or poorly on. Its broad, but its 100% better than nothing. More experienced engineers can help you find resources to work on your weaknesses.

I'm an incredibly anxious person and would rather spend more time getting things right with one exam than sitting two.

That being said. I'm having troubles deciding when to go for the exam? How do you know when you're ready?

At the moment, I've read through Lamelles guide, watch all the CBT nuggets, taken notes. Installed GNS3 and can get a multi node lab up and routing in minutes, I've also been able to work through frame relay switching on GNS3.

I also have several physical devices, 1800 and 3560 switches, to practice VLANs and STP. All of which I've done successfully.

I have subnetting down. I can pretty much reverse engineer a subnet in under 20 seconds. I do get thrown a little with class A's with C masks etc, but I'm better.

I also work in a company with a CCM, and fully CISCO setup running EIGRP. 

I'm at the point now where I'm going over notes, and of course there's weak areas (access lists and NAT, but I'm working on it) my routers don't have SDM installed as they're running Voice IOS. So I'm rusty on SDM, however it's GUI based and very easy from what i've seen.

However I dont know when to schedule it. It costs me $350 to sit it and I really dont have the kind of money to waste. If I pass, I get it back, if I fail, I don't. I want to be ready, and confident, but at the moment I feel like I'm going in circles. I'll go over STP and VLANS then forget OSPF stuff. Study up on OSPF and Frame relay and forget something else.

     PC 1.x   PC 2.x   PC 3.x   PC 4.x


I made the serial connections connecting them in the 10.0.0.0/30, starting from 0.

On each router I had an Fast Ethernet coming off into a 192.169.x.x/24 range each to a PC.

On each router, I did 
Router rip
version 2
network 10.0.0.0
network 192.168.0.0
On R1 and R4 which were connected to PC's in the 172.16.x.x range, I also had network 172.16.0.0

I waited for RIP to converge, in the end. R4 couldn't see back to R1, but R1 could see and ping everything. In fact from right to left, they seemed to be able to see only direct connected networks, while R1 could see everything.

Am I missing something? I didn't have any default routes set, my goal was to be able to ping all the PCs. The IP's for each serial link are in their own subnet i.e (R1 to R2 is 10.0.0.1/30 and 10.0.0.2/30, R2 to R3 is 10.0.0.5/30 to 10.0.0.6/30

Let me tell you a bit about myself in brief. I was in school (4 yr Uni) when my studies were cut short due to financial complications about a quarter or two shy of graduating. Searching for purpose, I stumbled upon Cisco certs as a way of potentially breaking into the tech industry without a degree. I read a few success stories,was sold and started studying.

Here I am almost a year later with a fairly firm grasp on the material. I understand everything but when I take practice tests, I find certain details eluded me and this shakes my confidence. Moreover, where I thought I had read tales of people finding employment after putting in the work to get their CCNA, even without a degree; I have more recently been seeing more mixed feedback, with a tendency toward the negative. 

This isn't so much a technical post as it is a psychological one. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut. The more I try to get a hold on the material I feel like I'm now backpedaling. Instead of progressing as I once was when trying to familiarize myself with networking as a whole, prepping for the actual test leaves me feeling stagnated. I get discouraged when I read that after all this effort I could end up fighting tooth and nail for a next to meaningless position until I can amass some experience or more certs. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting 6 figures out of the door upon passing. I was just hoping to make at least a living wage so I can move out, get my life on track and work my way up. I thought this was possible at first but upon further research the outlook seems increasingly bleak.

I'm planning on postponing my test date to next week.  Are there any other resources I can use to brush up on the topics I'm ""okay"" with?  If I had to choose my weakest areas, it would be: STP, the three different routing protocols, IPv6 and possibly WAN.

BTW I recommend 9tut.com as a great resource.

Anyways, this is my 4th time to re-certify since CCNA was my first cert in IT when I was 17 so I feel I have really good experience with the Cisco exams. On the flip side I also have several certs on the MS side (MCSE 2003/MCITP/MCSE 2012/Exchange 2010 MCITP as well as Microsoft Certified Master for Exchange 2010).

Here's my point regarding my preference of Cisco exams over Microsoft exams in terms of fairness. I've attended the Cisco Network Academy when I first got my CCNA, I've attended Microsoft Official Curriculum courses, read Cisco Press as well as Microsoft Press cert prep books. 

It's my personal opinion that the Cisco courses &amp; materials does a MUCH better job of preparing you for the actual test. I have never taken a Cisco exam &amp; said to myself ""WTF, I've never even heard of that or seen this talked about"". However, it seems I always end up saying that when taking MS exams. It seems they have one group of people building the study book &amp; courses and another group coming up with the questions which seem to just randomly grab them from pieces of Technet. I can actually somewhat confirm this because I know they outsource the test question creation process to a 3rd party which takes people who currently have the cert &amp; gets them all in a room together to randomly pick topics from Technet.

I think this is really poor strategy on their part which just leads to people brain dumping the exams instead of taking the time to actually learn it. what's everyone else's thought?",,False,self,t5_2qjhh,False,,,True,t3_1ft45t,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/1ft45t/why_i_prefer_cisco_exams_over_microsoft_just/,

I have not yet scheduled it, as I am relatively new (and I know I have a lot of work to do before I'm ready). Anyway... I am currently using Lammle's CCNA study guide for 640-802, and am attending the ICND2v2 class in a few months (by then I'll have made it through this guide and will have had some hands-on experience with our Cisco hardware). At that point, do you all feel I'll be adequately prepared for taking the full on CCNA v2 class? Am I missing anything by not specifically covering the ""ICND1v2"" material?

2) I just covered address summaries in my book. I understand how and why. But I have a specific question that is bugging me... Hoping someone could shed some light. This is a part of a question within a chapter review, and it's driving me nuts:

For the following sets of networks [I'm listing 2 of 10], provide the summary address and mask that will summarize the subnets:
66.66.0.0 through 66.66.15.0  |  192.168.1.0 through 192.168.120.0

My answers were (respectively):
66.66.0.0/20  |  192.168.0.0/17

Here are the answers in the book (respectively):
66.66.0.0 255.255.240.0  |  192.168.0.0/25

What is bugging me...
Why did the book avoid CIDR notation on the first one (and actually there are only 2 in the list of 10, where the book did use it)? Is there some reason for using the notation vs. listing out the full mask? I've re-read the material and have not found a reason to use one over the other (and I do understand that in the real world, it will typically only matter if the hardware doesn't support that notation/syntax). I'm just trying to make sure I'm not missing something as to why it's listed one way over the other in the book (and might also be required on the test).

The other part, is that I obviously got the second one wrong (unless it's a mistake by the author). I the others right (as long as CIDR notation would have been accepted in place of full masks). Why is the second one a /25 and not a /17? Wouldn't /17 equate to ""192.168.0-127.x"" and be the right answer? I see a /25 summary as ""192.168.0.0-127"" which would not cover the range specified in the 3rd octet. Am I missing something, or is this a typo? If anyone has this book, I'm looking at pages 198 and 204.

I attended the Cisco academy and out of 30 people, was only 1 of 5 to graduate.. by the skin of my teeth.  I never obtained certification, though, so it sort of was all for naught.  I'm currently working for a local ISP and they are requiring me to obtain CCNA certification before I can actually move up into any sort of network engineering position (currently in the NOC).  I have the CCENT, and am currently working on ICND2.  I already have taken the ICND2 once and failed it (not by much, but still failed it).  I've read Wendell Odom's INCD2 book front-to-back twice and am working on the third time.  I've watched all of the CBTNugget videos.  I can go into a simulation program and build a network from ground-up using VLANs, access lists, NAT, WAN links, EIGRP or OSPF, autosummarization, and basically anything else in the book without running into many problems.  But when it comes to answering questions, I seem to go blank.  The questions all seem so convoluted and confusing to me.  I recently signed up at a practice test site and I find myself STILL failing (Again, not by much, but it doesn't do much for my confidence if I can't pass the practice tests).   So, I'm here asking for help.. can ANYONE give me pointers on how to study and get over this ICND2 hump?  It's driving me mad, I've wanted to obtain CCNA certification for years and now I feel like I NEED to to further my career.

   However, routers are designed to not forward data link broadcasts (mac address broadcasts), as well as ip broadcasts. So how would you include routers in the ""management vlan""? 

   Take for example three routers connected in a line, end to end. One on the end could be configured to have an interface in the management vlan (this one will be doing routing on a stick for the switches), but the other two.. I'm guessing it involves applying an acl to a certain interface on each and then targeting specific ip addresses outside of the management vlan's subnet. So, not really a management vlan per se, but rather a management interface.  TIA

**TL;DR** Management vlans on routers? Is there such a thing? Or just use a management interface and an ACL  (would be on a different subnet than the management vlan) ?",,False,self,t5_2qjhh,False,,,True,t3_yqgzm,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/yqgzm/question_about_management_vlans/,

Everything seems to be in order. Thanks to anyone who read this and replied!

...I'll fill you in on my study methods in a moment, but for the most part, I'm paranoid about the fine print! It says that the score I got (854/1000) is ""preliminary"" and ""may be classified as indeterminate"". I'm not sure what this is how how it works.

I had kind of an unusual time taking the test, since that alleged 110 minutes for test time, but the timer began at 90 minutes. Also, I wasn't all that confident on the sims, since on one of them I was unclear about how to get the required results involving ""show"" commands.

Then at about 50 minutes in, all that coffee I drank started to kick in and I REALLY had to go to the bathroom! I wrapped up in about 65-70 minutes. I was hurrying because of my discomfort level. I didn't think I would pass, but I gave it 100%.

So, does anyone know about this validation process? What are my chances of having my test score revoked?

As for my learning methods:

I was fresh off of getting my Network+ certification, so that helped me on some of the material. Overall I studied for 8 weeks. I took a 6 week, intensive hands-on course. 16 hours a week of class time spent configuring routers and going over test objectives. We got to use actual Cisco equipment in class, which wasn't strictly necessary, but helped.

The teacher's emphasis was on ""practice practice practice"", and he ran us through a LOT of scenarios using Packet Tracer. The source material was written by Todd Lammle and published by Sybex. I spent another two weeks after the course was over, re-reading the book and going over the practice material at the end of the chapter.",,False,self,t5_2qjhh,1343486458.0,,,True,t3_x7myc,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/x7myc/passed_ccna_640802_but_what_is_this_about_waiting/,

**Question 2:**
I get what the *spanning-tree vlan 1 priority* does, but how do the spanning-tree commands on the actualy interface work?  If I set the port-priority on fa0/12 to something, and I set the global vlan priority to something else, which one is used to make forwarding decisions?

The reason I want to get the CCNA is that networking is probably my weakest area in terms of IT. I have worked in IT related jobs for 4 years now. First as a co-op student with the datacenter admin group of a fairly large company (10,000 employees) doing support for server hardware, Windows, VMWare and AIX. I had a chance to do a lot of lower level networking functions such as running cables and setting IP/gateway settings for the devices, but nothing on the switch side. Next I worked a year in application/database support for the company's test environments. Currently I am working for the government in a regulatory testing capacity, with a focus on system and network security.

I have a fairly solid grasp of network basics (OSI model, TCP/IP fundamentals, basic subnetting, DNS) but would like to expand on that knowledge to also include switch/router configs, VPN setups, TLS/SSL and routing.

So what is the best approach to preparing for ICND1/2 for someone in my situation? The Cisco official courses seem too expensive, but I'd prefer to have preparation with hands on experience.

I am currently working on my CCNA. It will be my first cert. I decided after searching Reddit that it will be more worthwhile than an A+/Net+

After that I am considering my Security+ because it seems like it opens doors for certain types of jobs. Would it be better than say the Cisco Security certs as for entry level stuff?

I am also considering maybe something along the lines of a VMware cert, or some other virtualization cert, because it is so prevalent and growing. 

So my question to the professionals of Reddit is what would you change/suggest about the direction I'm heading? Trying for the most bang for my buck and what will open more doors for myself.

I am also currently Interning with my local municipality's IT dept just to start gaining Experience time to put on my resume.

Weak areas for me were Wifi and WAN Links (I think I only got 3 questions on WAN though, hence the 33%). The wifi questions I didn't know were regarding the encryption and WPA vs WPA2, TKIP - AES, etc.

Suggestions to others: CBT Nuggets videos were far superior than the Odom books, or Train Signal videos. The narrator makes it very clear with subtle hints what is on the test, so pick up on it and write notes. 

The people saying ZOMG study subnetting are blowing it out of proportion, Just know your CIDR notation, what subnet mask goes along with that notation, and the interval of each mask.

I just took yet another practice exam and missed 2 questions on it that I'm not sure why I missed...

http://i.imgur.com/04Vswr6.jpg  
This question I answered A (which would give me 4 equal sized subnets) but they wanted F (which gives 8 equal sized subnets).  By the question I see that they want 1 subnet each for the 2 VLANs on SwitchC and SwitchD (2 total subnets) 1 subnet for the LAN off RouterA (3 total subnets) and 1 subnet for the link between RouterA and RouterB (4 total subnets)  

Where did I go wrong on this one?  Is it something to do with the ""ip subnet zero"" not being enabled?  What does that mean?

http://i.imgur.com/HXJOmWx.jpg

The obvious answer here for me is B and F as they are the only devices with public addresses however it asks for 3 choices.  I originally put C as well because it wont accept only 2 answers but the correct answer is B, D, and F as depicted.  

What am I missing here?

EDIT: HostB is on 172.1.1.9/24 and the private IP space starts at 172.16.0.0/20.....  Derrrrp, is that the right answer then?  I could just remove my own idiocy but mayhaps it will help some other poor soul out.

It's surprising to me that it wasn't featured at all on the exam. I do appreciate that there are a number of versions of the 100-101 exam out there (and I'm guessing a random selection from a pool of questions is at play as well), but it still seems odd that one of the big topics that was moved to CCENT for the 100-101 and 200-101 series wasn't even touched on. I was hoping someone might shed a little light on how often Cisco makes changes to the exams; is it a topic that they might be phasing in over the life of these exams, or is what I saw today essentially the same exam that someone will see in a couple of years? I realize that Cisco keeps their methods pretty secret, but I imagine there are a few people on this subreddit that've seen a number of exams come and go. My own feeling, which I freely admit could be totally wrong, is that they're slowly introducing it as an exam topic while the 640 series is still being taken and studied.

Today I scraped through the 640-802 with 841/1000.

Been using this subreddit a lot over the past six weeks, it's been soo useful. I passed my first CCNA in 2007 so I suppose I had a good foundation, but that timed out in 2010.

Anyway, thought I'd share the wealth on what I did.

The first thing I did was just book the exam. I booked it on 1st May and have just studied with almost all of my free time since. On average, I'd say 2 hours a night after work and around 14-15 hours some weekends. I personally found it _really_ useful having a definite date set to sit it. Otherwise I was scared of just revising into oblivion and never getting round to doing the thing.

I ordered Wendell Odom's CCNA Certification Library: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1587204371/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

I'd say reading through those books and working through all the extra material with it was the most useful resource.
I also used the CBT Nuggets video series. I found Jeremy Cioara was a breathe of fresh air when reviewing topics; something about the way he teaches really gets you motivated to start labbing after having read the really complex details in the book.

I did my research and built a CCNA lab, ordering all the parts off Ebay/Amazon. I used Wendell Odom's site as a guide: http://www.certskills.com/LabGear/CCNA/BuildLists.aspx

Here's the lab:
http://imgur.com/JXwoGAO

For info, it's 3 x 1760's from Ebay, each with a WIC-2T and 3 x Back to Back serial cables. Three cheap 2950's too.

I also used Packet Tracer to create a huge lab involving all the different technologies (frame relay, routing protocols, VLSM, VLANs, STP etc etc).

To practice subnetting, I simply used www.subnettingquestions.com

Having done the CCNA before, I'd already learned a particular way to do subnetting and I'm comfortable with it. In fact, the sections of Wendell Odom's book and the CBT Nuggets videos regarding subnetting I just completely skipped. All I'd say is find a way that's good for you and stick with it. Learning multiple ways of doing it I'd say would be a bad idea. Mostly it just comes with practice, so find a way you like (and that works!) and just keep practicing with it. If you're gonna sit the single CCNA exam I would say you need to be pretty snappy with it though.

What I did in the last week was activate the exams that came with Wendell Odom's library. These were super useful, I only wished I'd activated them sooner as they would have been a great way to test my knowledge on areas I'd just read up and done lab work on.

That pretty much sums up everything I used to learn the material. 

My thoughts on the actual exam... it was _hard_. I found it very difficult anyway. I had two labs to work through, one to set up ACLs and another to configure/troubleshoot EIGRP. Getting to question 50 of 50 with 5 minutes on the clock only to be presented with an EIGRP lab was heart breaking. In the end I found the actual solution but didn't have enough time to type in the command and the exam finished. I swear if I could have just finished that lab my mark would have been closer to the 90 mark!

Anyway, it feels great to be back certified, I now intend to kick back and head to Glastonbury festival tomorrow :)

Just having one of those moments where something almost entirely makes sense, but I can't tell if it's a typo and this exact question hasn't come up in the errata.

The following networks need summarization:

172.1.4.0/25

172.1.4.128/25

172.1.5.0/24

172.1.6.0/24

172.1.7.0/24

From what I can see, the 3rd (interesting) octet appears to increase in a way that would fall within a block size of 4. So, we can say the summarization is 172.1.0.0/22 (/22 being a 252 mask, so 4 block size).

What confuses me is that, if we're using a /22, that means the ranges are:

172.1.0.1 through 172.1.3.254

172.1.4.1 through 172.1.7.254

etc.

This makes sense for all of the above networks that need summarization, except for the 172.1.4.0/25...Or is it that valid host ranges don't really matter in summarization and that you can lump a 172.1.4.0/25 network into summarization under a 172.1.0.0/22 without worrying about it being invalid?

My question is how that would change if the network mask is /25? Or /23? I realize it's likely a pretty simple answer but I don't know how that would impact my calculations. Hoping someone can help on this?

Promptly failed when renewing my CCNA.,12,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/1fb00b/angry_passed_ccnp_exams_last_august_promptly/,"I originally passed my CCNA rather easily in 2003, then let it lapse.  Didn't really care about it.  Took my CCNP exams this past summer only to find out it doesn't actually count unless I renew my CCNA.  So I re-took my CCNA and failed it.  I was angry.  VERY angry.

I finally got around to rescheduling the test (at $300 a pop, I was a in no hurry!), and this time I'm not screwing around.  I'm using every method to make sure I give the ""right"" answers this time.  I am legitimately angry because the access list lab is rigged to make you give the wrong answer.

It specifically tells you to ""allow web access from host X to server Y.  Block all other types of traffic"".  Not ""all other tcp traffic"".  ALL OTHER TYPES OF TRAFFIC.

I know for fact when I did the test last August, and in fact in any implementation in the last decade or more, if you told me to do this, I would allow ports 80 and 443 TCP, and then deny all IP.

Reading several test tutorials, it seems Cisco wants you to allow only port 80 TCP (pedantic, but okay), then turn around and deny all TCP traffic.

I got at least that lab wrong despite having a functional implementation (it passed all connectivity tests, of course) because they want you to give the wrong answer.

UUUUUUGGGGGHHHHH.  So now I'm memorizing the wrong answer so I can pass this flipping test so that my CCN**P** will be valid.

Screw you very much, Cisco.

***

EDIT - Okay, perhaps my anger is unwarranted here.  I'm reading reports that there was a bug in the sim and that it should be fixed now.  This is just getting under my skin.  I obviously know how to network.  This is now about me know what they want me to regurgitate into their sim so I can have my cert be valid.  There's no human way I pass all three of the CCNP exams and not know the basics.

Screw it, I'm rolling with this solution.  I know it is the correct one.  If they fail me on it again, they can take their cert and shove it:

&gt;access-list 100 permit tcp host (allowed host) host (restricted server) eq www  
access-list 100 deny ip any host (restricted server)  
access-list 100 permit ip any host (unrestricted server) 

Apply this access-list to the interface nearest the web servers.  If I were presented with these requirements IRL, this is how I would do it.

**It was incredibly easy and took 30 minutes if you have the stuff laying around! It's also pretty cheap.**

**[SETUP DIAGRAM](http://imgur.com/6qSMg5Q)**

My network lab isn't connected to my home network in any way as I make a ton of changes while practicing for my CCNA. I thought about connecting them to manage the stuff, but frequent changes of VLANs and IP addresses would have screwed me up.

###Here is what you need:

1. [USB&gt;Serial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007T27H8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) adapters for each device in your lab (or enough serial ports )
2. An old computer fast enough to run a Linux distribution. 

  **(I used Ubuntu Server 12.10...and that's how I'll write this tutorial for)**
3. Enough USB ports for all your devices.

  **(I used a Hub to make the setup as clean as possible. I'd reccommend a powered hub if you have boat loads of devices)**

You can obviously do the wiring any way you want...like using console cables instead of the DB9/RJ45 adapters like I did. **[HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/19odee/cisco_rollover_cable_your_services_are_no_longer/)** is the post on how to to wire the adapters.

I used **[these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007T27H8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)** USB/Serial Adapters since they were cheap and they worked without effort in Ubuntu 12.10.

###**Here are the steps I took:**

1. Hook it all up

2. Install Ubuntu Server 12.10 on the PC.

  **(I made my hostname AccessServer...I also selected to OpenSSH Server option when presented with tasksel)**

3. Install the software to make the magic happen (ser2net)

  Here are the terminal commands I used...**[this](http://cciedynamips.wordpress.com/category/6-installing-setting-up-ser2net/)** and **[this](http://mellowd.co.uk/ccie/?tag=ser2net)** will probably help you.

**Update your packages:**

    sudo apt-get update

**Install ser2net**

    sudo apt-get install ser2net

**Determine the names of your serial ports**
  
My built in ports were ttyS0 (serial) and ttyS1 (parallel).

My USB/Serial adapters were ttyUSB0, ttyUSB1...

    dmesg | grep tty

**Edit the config file in a text editor**

    sudo nano /etc/ser2net.conf

**Modify the end of the file**

This is what mine looked like...I used all USB adapters to make the physical wiring nice and clean

    2000:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB0:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2001:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB1:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2002:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB2:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2003:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB3:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    ...

Press Ctrl+O to write the file, CTRL+X to exit nano

**Restart ser2net so the changes are there**

    sudo /etc/init.d/ser2net restart

**All Done! Now test via telnet from another computer on your LAN**

    telnet AccessServer [port]

Use the port number that lines up with the tty device you typed into the config file. I like to use SecureCRT and keep sessions open with all devices in tabs.

You could make a few changes to the setup if you want to access the server remotely, but I had not interest in doing so. I will only access the lab from the local network.

**I simply did this to remove wires from my apartment and make it so I only need to get up for topology changes. Changes to router/switch configurations no longer disconnect me. Think of it as a local out-of-band management**

I'm not the first person to ask this question. However, I feel that I have a different skill set that the other people I have seen post and I just wanted to run this by other Cisco/Networking folks and get your opinions.
Basically, I am 27 years old, have a BA in history and live in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I landed my first job out of college and part of the job requirement was integrating our product into the clients existing infrastructure (which sounds cool but was really just setting up vlans or bugging the admin to put a rout to our subnet in his router and occasionally getting to mess around in a wire closet). So in July the company starts having trouble and by September we show up on a Monday and they had locked the doors on us. 
I started attending the Cisco netacad at my local community college in the Fall and hope to have my CCNA in hand by May. I felt this was a better route &lt;--- Network humor --- than just braindumpping for an exam. The program really does push you and I have logged about 300 hours in the lab working mostly on 2900 series switches and 2600 series routers and feel that I am really getting a good foundation in networking - I've made A's through fundamentals and routing and am holding down an A in switching . In addition I've also been able to take some security classes and plan on getting my Security+ around May around the same time I get the CCNA and eventually a CCNA Security. 
So basically what I'm curious about is how marketable is that kind of skill set in a rather large market like DFW and secondly what kind of job should I aim for. I am certainly not above starting at the bottom and working my way up in the industry but at the same time my wife is on my back to get out there and make money. 
Thanks, any input would be helpful and greatly appreciated.

Basically, I had to use a CLI to answer questions about the configuration of a router. One of the questions went a little something like this:
What connection was the WAN interface on?
A) Serial 0/0
B) Serial 0/1
C) Fast Ethernet 0/0
D) Fast Ethernet 0/1

Doing a show_ip_interface I looked at the interfaces. Serial 0/0 was up and had the usual information tied with that and a matching WAN IP from the diagram. . Serial 0/1 was administratively down. Easy answer right?


 Later on in the same question, I used the command show_ip_interface_brief. This had a truncated view of the interfaces, and I saw that serial 0/0 was administrativley down, and serial 0/1 was up, and that it had THE SAME IP as serial 0/0 shown in the show_ip_interface.

Anyone here who started CCNA with zero experience have any tips? Or even those that did? The courses are a month long at 56 hours, and there are 4 in total.

I see great potential for career progression here, but not in the field I’m in.
Now here’s my question, I have ZERO networking skills/knowledge. What is my best root to get into it?

The entire course is based around a physical and logical topology of a network which consists of several switches and routers, including a PC which telnets into network devices. During the course the network is slowly configured from the beginning until the given topologies are built at the end. Apparently, the whole thing was setup by folks at INE for its students who practiced on the setup during the week of the course. We see all that on the videos as it happens, and as I progressed into 6th or 7th video, I realized that I'm not going to learn much just by looking, I simply have to follow the material hands-on, just the way the students did during that week.

Now I'm a beginner in internetworking, I have obtained a copy of Cisco Packet Tracer, and was thinking of taking a screenshot of the given topologies and trying to replicate the setup in Packet Tracer. The topologies don't look super-complex, but I have a feeling that trying to set it up would be a hell of a task for a beginner like me.

My question is, is it doable, did anyone manage to do it, is there maybe a better solution for following the material in the videos? Or, is there an obtainable finished PT setup from the videos, saving me from much hassle?

As part of a prac test we are doing for the Accessing the WAN component of my CCNA study course, we are required to set a standard ACL on R1 that prevents traffic from the PC3 in the 10.0.0.128 /25 network from reaching PC 1 in the 10.0.0.10 /25. 
No problem - create the standard ACL and assign it to the fa0/1 interface that is on the 10.0.0.10 /25 network.  

Then we're required to set up NAT so that PC3 can reach PC1.

PC1 connected to R1, PC3 to R3, there's a serial link between the two routers on the 172.16.0.8 /30 subnet.

I've been doing my head in trying to get this to work in packet tracer, with no luck, by making a static NAT on R3, translating PC3's ip to 192.168.1.1, and setting a static route on R1 that points 192.168.1.1 to R3. 

If anyone has read this far - got any advice? I'm missing something here but I don't know what. Either that, or NAT doesn't work well on packet tracer.

I'm wrapping up the 100-101 study guide, and just got through the portion of IPv6 regarding static routes. It's all pretty clear to me (in fact I like IPv6 more than IPv4), but I don't see why configuring static routes with the link local address of the next-hop was even included as an option in the IOS - it seems rather pointless; in order to even use it you have to include the outgoing local interface as well, so why not just stop there? What circumstances would make the link local a preferable alternative to the neighbor's unicast address or the outgoing local interface? It's clearly a well-thought-out protocol, so I'm guessing there must be a reason beyond my current level of knowledge.

I do typical on-site/field ticket resolution, and after replacing hard drives and reseating RAM/disk controllers and cards, I'd say I know my way around a server pretty darn well. Then again, pretty sure anyone with a modest degree of basic computer knowledge could say the same to some degree. As far as certifications go, it's my understanding that the A+ certification is essentially a piece of paper saying you possess this knowledge (after you pass their test obviously).

I've recently started working with fiber connections as well, which is really exciting. The technology is just fucking crazy. Plus lots of new gadgets like light meters and fiber cleaners. However, this has been the first new thing in my entire tenure, and I'm tired of resting on my laurels.

So, besides my hands-on time with servers, I have a slightly above average tech background knowledge as a 25 year old. Built my own bastard tower, have a basic idea of how the internetz works, etc. I got that deal on the cisco online learning from IT University on Groupon, and I've only gotten halfway through Module 1 because the guy is such a bore. I liked the CBT Nuggets video I watched the other day, I think I might subscribe to them for a bit.

But, my question to you is - should I do the CISCO recommended route of ICND1--&gt;ICND2, and THEN my CCNA? Or just go right for the CCNA? I was gonna power through these modules for the CCNA and just find that there's a lot of underlying knowledge that I lack, I'll just head back and do ICND1--&gt;ICND2. I turn to you, CCNA'ers of Reddit! Give me all your knowledge =p

I can subnet in my head and can configure anything from memory. The exam just seemed SO hard and a lot more focused on troubleshooting then anything else.

My dad bought this course for me a bit back when they were running a Groupon deal.  He asked me if I was interested first, so I checked it out, and discussion on Spiceworks wasn't *fantastic*, but people said it was a decent starting point.

I just have some concerns, because another user I was PM'ing a while back said he's in hiring for his department, and can easily tell when someone has just run through a bootcamp to pass a test, as opposed to those who know their stuff. I want to actually know this stuff.  I want to be good at it.  That said, I'm kind of lost as to a starting point outside of the handful of houses I've wired up.

I took a look at some textbooks at B&amp;N the other day, to get some ideas of what to possibly supplement this course with.  Not quite sure if I should supplement this course with something, or something with this course, or not worry about it.

I just kind of feel in over my head right now.  I am pretty sharp when it comes to this sort of thing, but I also have a tendency to overthink things and second guess myself.

Something for everyone under the CCIE level. 

Eventually, I'll be renting out several lab racks expressly for CCNA study, at CCNA $$$ prices, ($5 or less, per 5.5 hour block.)with 3 1841's, 3 3550's, and possibly even a TFTP server for IOS upgrade training. It will have some of the bells and whistles that the CCIE rack rental companies, like remote reboot(not sure that is really needed in CCNA) and then some things that let you know it's a mom-and-pop show, like scheduling, which for a while will probably be by google calendar and e-mail, with at least a couple hours notice. Not looking to make a ton of money, just provide what appears to be a needed service. Eventually. I'd like to branch off into a security, wireless, and voice (then Juniper) racks as well. You won't even have to drop and config your routers as in GNS3. 
They will already be set up, and all you will have to do is no shut the ports you want to use. Most scenarios you will find in the config vids from CBT Nuggets will be available.

The whole idea for me is to follow my favorite online passtime, iracing.com, whose motto is ""sit down and race"", following the Keep it simple philosophy. 

The blog is three years old, and I'm posting more now than I have ever. I work somewhat in the industry, more on alcatel, Juniper, and Cisco transport equipment, though. After I finish the CCNP, there will be info from my attempts at those certs as well.

* Using different terminal software, teraterm, putty, hyperterminal
* Using a different baud rate (tried every common one I could find out there)
* Tried booting them in ROMMON mode
* Tried different usb ports (using usb to db9 adaptor + console cable)
 
What am I missing? I can access my routers perfectly fine but both switches act identically. Boot up fine, pass frames fine, but nothing from the console connection.

Onto the question:
I have a router, on the inside I have a couple of PCS that I've locked down to accessing specific servers and ports.

I've created an ACL applied it to the outside interface, but was having trouble accessing the machine remotely.

Probably because the machine I'm accessing it on isn't apart of the network it's allowed to access.

So I remembered ""established"" command and I've applied it to the interface.

So my access list looks like this:
Extended IP access list 110

    10 permit tcp any 192.168.192.0 0.0.31.255 eq 40100 (380 matches)

    20 permit tcp any 192.168.192.0 0.0.31.255 eq www (51 matches)

    30 permit tcp any 192.168.192.0 0.0.31.255 eq 443 (10 matches)

    40 permit tcp any 192.168.192.0 0.0.31.255 eq 6464

    50 permit tcp any 192.168.192.0 0.0.31.255 eq 7575

    60 permit icmp any 192.168.192.0 0.0.31.255

    70 permit ip host 192.168.58.15 any (66 matches)

    80 permit ip host 192.168.58.10 any

    90 permit ip host 192.168.58.12 any (723422 matches)

    100 permit ip host 192.168.58.16 any

    120 permit tcp any any established (7585 matches)


It's all working fine, but I want to make sure that the any any established command hasn't circumvented the preceding entries.

The singular hosts 70-100 are servers allowed to access anything.

Anyone able to confirm this?

I assume that the real exam pulls from a much larger database of questions, and in different formats.  I'm also only about 70% confident in my subnetting skills, but does that really matter if I'm very prepared for every other topic type?  I plan on using the finger method of deriving useful subnets (powers of 2) and writing out a table and using the circle method of deriving hosts.  Are subnetting word problems usually a large chunk of the test?  (Disregard that one if it's a no-no.)

The practice test came from the IT University Online 640-822 course that I think was produced in 2007, but possibly earlier.  Because of my very good general understanding of networking, I have chosen not to utilize other sources for my CCENT studies.  (I will utilize more sources for my CCNA later)  Has anyone else used IT Uni online?  I am concerned that the course and practice tests are insufficient.  I've been in networking for over 10 years, but don't have much Cisco-specific experience.  My conceptual understanding of networking is very thorough, but I will certainly miss some questions on Cisco CLI commands and syntax.

I don't expect anyone to give me a conclusive answer, so I won't be holding anyone to their response.  I guess I'm just looking for a bit of a pat on the back; enough to allow me to sleep confidently.

So my understanding is that you set up NAT as dynamic, and ""overloaded"" so that you can potentially have fewer real registered IP addresses than you have hosts who need simultaneous internet connectivity. This means that you're implementing PAT = port address translation, where the port refers to the port of the actual TCP segment.

My question is, when the router is screwing around with the lookup tables for a given TCP port, it should have *several* TCP ports associated with a given private address, right? Several different TCP ports that map to the same IP address? (I am assuming one computer is using several different TCP source ports because it is communicating with multiple other hosts).

Also, if the TCP port number needs to me something like http or telnet, is it impossible for this device to communicate if it's on the wrong end of PAT? e.g., let's say two FTP servers are on a private network and I wanted to have a host on a different LAN communicate with both of them.

Just a little background, I am a IT teacher for my high school, and we have just implemented Cisco networking into our classrooms.  My background happens to be in maintenance and programming, but I was very excited to get into the material.  After teaching it for the past month and a half, I have to say that I may enjoy networking more than any other IT field.  I do have a couple of questions though so try not to judge me, as I have only been doing this for  a month and a half haha(I am getting certified as a Cisco Instructor and I am probably going to take the CCNA this summer)

Anywho, here is my dilemma. I am have a huge culminating project over routing, switching, and routing protocols.  I have in my possession 14 computers, 3 layer 2 Cisco switches (can't think of the model at the moment), and a couple of 1800 series routers.  We have an open fiber connection that is connected to our football field that I would like the kids to use.  We have cable ran to the school that is connected to a Cisco small business router (basically a home networking router), and a layer 2 switch.

Here is what I would like to do.  I would like to have 7 computers on one switch, 7 on the other, and those 2 switches connected to  2 different routers that are connected with a DCE/DTE cable to simulate a WAN connection.  I would then like to set up a connection to my small business router so the computers could hook up to the internet.  So here is my question:  how would I got about connecting the computers to the internet?  I understand how to connect the two routers together, how to simulate a WAN connection, and how to assign IP addresses dynamically and statically.  The problem I am worried about is twofold:  Setting up NAT with the routers, and IP address conflicts.  Should I (or do I have to) let the small business router deal with the NAT and IP assigning (currently the small business router dynamically assigns IP addresses to the 3 computers it is connected to), and if I do that, what commands do I have to put in my 1800 series routers in order to successfully forward traffic to the small business internet router.  Should I, instead, just create a Windows 2008 DHCP server?  I know this is confusing, but maybe you can help me!

tl;dr - I need to set up a small network of 14 computers, two layer 2 switches, and 2 Cisco 1800 series routers to connect to a home router in order to get those computers on the net....help!

Ok guys, get me to the ""cloud router"" (router 3) without using a routing protocol.  That is all I have left to figure out my topology.  I must not be doing static routes correctly!

NINJA EDIT:  I do not mind if you use RIP, EIGRP, etc to set up the internal, but I need to know how to connect to the 3 router from the first router using a static route.  Thanks!

Each router has two serial cards now.  They originally came with one serial card, but I needed to multilink two T1 lines a couple years ago and purchased additional cards.  I don't remember the model numbers exactly, but the extra cards I purchased were configured a bit differently than the original cards that shipped.  Almost like there are sub-interfaces.  It's been awhile, so I don't remember the component capabilities.

I assume these routers would more than work for the CCNA, but I think I read something about having three routers would work best for studying/practicing frame relay.  Would an additional, cheaper, router work well in this situation?

I also would like to purchase a few switches, but I am not very knowledgeable on the models.  I think the models suggested were 2950 and 3550.  In the end, I would like to have hardware to support CCNP without buying new hardware.

In addition, I've set up GNS3, linked it to a physical network, and thought I might be able to use this as an additional router with the other physical devices.

I've begun a class recently for the CCNA. I've studied for about a day and the professor mentioned that jobs can be found in other parts of my state, but not here. I want to relocate when I get certified but I want to be sure that I have a job lined up for me, so I have a couple of questions and some concerns about all of this.

I don't have much experience with jobs. I have a little volunteer experience from high school, about a year as a cashier and 4 months as a computer repair guy at a small shop. All I'll have is a CCNA after that and it'll be a year before the class ends, so I have some time to look for a job and work around my weird school schedule.

I'm very scared of the job market right now. I just went to monster.com and there were a total of 7 network admin jobs listed for the place I wanted to relocate to. I went to simplyhired and there were a lot of pages, but also a lot of unrelated jobs as the pages went on. And every network admin job wanted 5 - 7 years of experience.

I'm really lost, scared and honestly feeling pretty low right now about other things in my life that I don't need to go into. But this CCNA stuff is basically my dream at the moment. The material looks really cool -- I actually think I'm going to like this stuff a lot. The professor even said it's really fun, even if it doesn't look that way. It was surprising, actually. But how can I find a job after getting certified without any networking *work* experience?

I read another thread here where someone mentioned government contracting jobs, but when I spoke to someone about that they said I might have to move somewhere else. There's a certain city I want to move to and I don't know if I want to work for the government only because it seems a bit limiting and not too secure.

**------Material--------**


* **Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching 200-120 Official Cert Guide Library** [link!](http://www.ciscopress.com/store/cisco-ccna-routing-and-switching-200-120-official-cert-9781587143878)
--This book was good value for money it came with a pearsonvue testing software and 650 Questions and its all sectioned into chapters, so when you read a chapter of the book you can test yourself on questions relating to that chapter, its also good to use these to see if you need to read a chapter thoroughly or if you can just summarize Key Points

++if you are considering using braindumps.... dont, buy this book instead...ciscos 650 questions are going to help you study far better than braindumps, braindumps are unorganised and do not help you reinforce your knowledge as good as the pearsonvue testing software does.

* **Ranet Packet Tracer Labs** [Link!](http://www.ranet.co.th/articlesi.php?id=012)cant read arabic... neither download [here](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/servlet/JiveServlet/download/12808-1-42776/Ranet_Labs_and_Solutions.zip)
-- I found these good despite there being some issues with NAT and DHCP and ACL labs...and the phrasing is a bit...international? trying not to sound arrogant, ill clear it up ...you can tell whoever wrote it...english is a 2nd language, however still completely understandable.

I nailed all of the Packet tracer exercises in just under 12 hours...with breaks, I tried to get into GNS3, but well theres no switch emulation right? 


**--------Study Plan----------  ** 52 Chapters in Total
     
* **Phase 1** (ICND1) 30 Chapters

Today I've been trying to hook up my home CCNA lab to my internet connection. The first problem I had was my little D-Link router would not let me configure routes so I had to remove the old firmware and put DD-WRT on it. It's a D-Link DIR-615.

Anyway, I cannot get any hosts from within my lab network to communicate with the outside world (I'm trying to just get web access). I can ping the WAN interface with a connected laptop within my lab. And from my lab with a router having an interface sitting in the same network as my usual home network, I can ping the default gateway for my WAN interface.

I've put an album here of my current set up and the tests I've been doing: http://imgur.com/a/pJPHR

I'm convinced its to do with the routing on my home router (RydalHigh) but I just cannot understand what's happening with some of the tracerts on my hosts. They'll trace to my router's WAN interface just fine, but refuse to trace to my WAN default gateway and also seem to take a different route?

Anyway, if anyone's got the time to take a look at this and give me some pointers that'd be great. Sorry if this seems a bit disjointed but I've been trying to configure this for hours and have quickly put this together! I'm more than happy to provide any further info...
