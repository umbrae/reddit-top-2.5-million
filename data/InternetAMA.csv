1350139487.0,766,self.InternetAMA,11eydk,"I am POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS, shadow-banned by the lying Admin /u/Dacvak. Ask me anything.",1660,894,1413,http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/11eydk/i_am_potato_in_my_anus_shadowbanned_by_the_lying/,"I believe some people know who I am. I have been shadow-banned by the Admin /u/Dacvak, who has now started spreading lies about the reasons why he banned me.

Please feel free to ask me anything.

But first, I would like to say this, which is important regarding the screenshot that was posted in Subredditdrama yesterday. The screenshot was NOT altered in any way.

There have been a lot of stories flying around about why I am shadow-banned and the simple, true reason is this: I was shadow-banned because yesterday I made a post asking users to be extremely careful when posting in NSFW subreddits, because Redditors are now being doxxed. The website Jezebel had linked to a Tumblr which doxxed dozens of Redditors and linked their Facebook profiles to their Reddit comments, along with their actual pictures. I wanted Redditors to be extra careful so that no harm ever comes to them in real life.

I then logged into my Gmail yesterday where the Admin /u/Dacvak had a conversation with me. This is the full, unedited screenshot (the only information removed is my email address at the top but many people already know it so if you can find it, feel free to email me):

Full screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/rz41P.png

The reason why Dacvak shadow banned me is because 'I created drama within 24 hours' and that is all. I was banned minutes after that conversation ended.

Dacvak, however, has decided to completely lie about what happened. There is this [post he made earlier on today](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11c4j3/admins_have_shadow_banned_upotato_in_my_anus/c6l5w5o?context=3) where he says

&gt; ""There are actually a lot of rules that we (the admins) recently found out when we investigated his (PIMA's) account that he had broken. The most recent one was creating a subreddit that disregarded the rules of reddit regarding sexualizing teens/minors, and not being active in moderating posts that broke that rule. He's had multiple offenses in that category."" [Screenshot in case he edits it again](http://i.imgur.com/v5kqX.png)

There are three things to say about this (the last one being the absolute most important). Firstly, regarding this:

&gt; ""The most recent one was creating a subreddit that disregarded the rules of reddit regarding sexualizing teens/minors, and not being active in moderating posts that broke that rule.""

This is a complete lie. I was not creating any subreddit that disregarded the rules and Dacvak's lie is obvious. If I was allegedly creating a Reddit that sexualised minors, and not active in moderating posts that broke that rule...

Then would I still have my account if I HAD been active in moderating the posts? 

But of course, Dacvak has no answer to that, because it is a lie. There was no subreddit created by me for that purpose.

And secondly, again, Dacvak states that I was shadow-banned because I was not active in moderating posts in this alleged subreddit.

Alot of you will remember a subreddit called /r/Xsmall that was banned by the Admins because CP was being posted and there was only one moderator for the subreddit. [The saga can be read here](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/wnxj2/rxsmall_has_been_incorrectly_banned/)

This moderator was /u/baconfan... who still has his account.

By that logic, /u/baconfan should also be shadow-banned for not actively moderating his subreddit. But of course, that won't happen, and nor should it, because this is all fiction by Dacvak.

And now, finally, I would like to say this. Again, regarding this comment by Dacvak:

&gt; ""There are actually a lot of rules that we (the admins) recently found out when we investigated his (PIMA's) account that he had broken.""

Really?

Funny, because only a few days ago when you we spoke on Gmail chat, you said **I was in no danger of being shadow-banned**

Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/G6lBJ.png

Amazing how things change in the matter of a few days, right? 

No doubt you are going to say these screenshots are edited too, but I am happy to have them verified. So... if the community still doubts me, and the truth of the conversations with Dacvak, please select a Redditor who is respected and trustworthy...

**AND I WILL GIVE THEM THE PASSWORD TO MY GMAIL ACCOUNT SO THEY CAN VERIFY THE TRUTH OF THESE CHAT RECORDS**

I really do not care what happens to me, but I find it utterly disgraceful and unethical that a Reddit Administrator no less can so brazenly lie about what has happened. You were appointed to be the Community manager, Dacvak, but when the community manager himself is openly distorting the truth just to cover his own tracks, then... well, what is there to say?

And to other Redditors I ask you this much, again:

PLEASE STAY SAFE WHEN POSTING ON NSFW SUBREDDITS.

You have all heard about what has happened, and how some people with a vendetta can completely dox you, even if you post very rarely, and even, in some cases, if your comments are spun out of context and deliberately misinterpreted.

I couldn't give a damn about my account and being shadow-banned. But I DO give a damn about peoples safety, more so than the Admins who would rather ban me for 'posting drama within a 24 hour period' than alert you to taking precautions.

Again... I am happy to hand over the password to a respected Redditor who can verify the chats I had with Dacvak.",,False,,t5_2v33w,1350139705.0,,,True,t3_11eydk,http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/11eydk/i_am_potato_in_my_anus_shadowbanned_by_the_lying/,

I definitely *do* know how to make bots because I made this one and it's been running smoothly for 10 months as of today (it went live Jan 1st, 2012).

qkme_transcriber is a bot that posts transcriptions of Quickmeme.com links ([like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1268vy/my_girlfriend_says_im_too_shy_online/c6si2eg?context=3)).

The bot has a [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/qkme_transcriber/comments/o426k/faq_for_the_qkme_transcriber_bot/) and a [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/qkme_transcriber/).

I usually only respond ""in character"" as if the bot were sentient for various reasons (like: it's fun, people like it, it makes people more accepting of the bot, it's an interesting writing exercise), but here I will be answering questions out of character as the dude who programmed the bot and keeps it running. 

My [first AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/vxeak/hello_i_am_a_bot_who_posts_transcriptions_of/) was done in-character, if you want to see how that works.

Admins are saying I accepted payment from a spammer named poweromania and that I never reported it. Unfortunately for them, I have the report right here: http://np.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/102sm1/overview_for_poweromania/

The thing that I think stinks about this is that the admins have taken multiple hours out of their days to take punitive action against me and other mods for completely false accusations and simply won't take any time to remove illegal or questionable material that I report to them. 

Over the last few months I have reported multiple instances of illegal or questionable material to the admins and they have simply ignored all of my messages. They also refuse to remove the URLs as you can see here: http://i.imgur.com/s7bn9.png

Admins are the only ones who can *delete* those URLs, moderators can only remove them from visibility. As you can see, that's what we did. Unfortunately, Reddit admin cannot be bothered to take 5 extra seconds to delete this link and protect children that are being abused. They would rather punish myself and my 2 co-mods and accuse us of something we absolutely never did. 

I have to step away for a few minutes but please ask any questions and I will respond when I return.

* Co-organizer of the Reddit Jet Blue Travel project, and drove the travelers to Kansas to attend the Kansas State Fair
* Former mod of AskReddit, IAmA, Pets, and some others I can't recall--one of the original mods of Relationship\_Advice (and still a mod there now as well as a couple other small subs)
* Adopted a cat I rescued out through Reddit, made the local paper for it under a fake name, sadly the adoption did not work out and the cat now has a new-new home
* Created /r/Equality and got it stolen by pn6 (now kloo2yoo) but it was later returned
* Banned from SRS for being friends with VA
* Was in that ill-fated Reddit calendar
* /u/Warlizard says I'm his favorite spammer

Oh yeah and there was that witch hunt thing.

Non-reddit items of interest:

* Equestrian
* Victim advocate
* Involved in local politics
* Own a Corgi mix
* This space left vacant for future use because I refuse to accept that I am less than five bullet points worth of interesting outside Reddit

I hate flounces and long goodbyes, but it would be disingenuous not to mention that I've deleted most of my submissions and comments (left the cute animals I used to submit back in the day though) and will be deleting my account in a day or so. I'm not mad at anyone, I still love Reddit, and I have registered /u/PreviouslySaydrah in case I want to pop in verifiably as myself and comment if people mention me or something. It's just time to move on from this account and go back to enjoying Reddit as a source of interesting links and a place to occasionally comment if I have something of value to say. I have some alts that I used in the past that I'll probably pick up again. It's really more enjoyable just being a Redditor than being a recognizable name here. Maybe I'll start doing the thing where you delete your account every six months. I don't really know--I just know I've been thinking for a long time about this and I came to the conclusion that it's time to make a change. The VA incident did influence me, but only by a couple months--I was originally planning to do this on 12/12/12, just for giggles.

I debated about posting this and came to the compromise that I do want to say goodbye and give anyone who has questions for me a chance to ask them, but that I'm posting it at a low-traffic time on purpose. Please don't make a big deal or crosspost or anything like that. I can't stop you, but it's really not what I want. I just want to have a last conversation as ""Saydrah"" with the people who care enough about Reddit history and ""Internet fame"" to already be subscribed here.

I reserve the right not to answer anything that I don't want to answer. What are you going to do about it, force me to delete my account? :)

Oh, and I have no plans to stop using Saydrah as my AIM name, so you can still reach me if you want to. 

That said, AMA. I'm going to bed now (well after this episode of Firefly is over) but I'll answer some questions in the morning and stick around until I feel like pulling the plug and moving on.

I love you all, and I would not be the person I am today had I never discovered Reddit. Take that as a good or a bad thing, as you will.

ETA: I've asked an admin to shadowban me. If they actually grant my request, I could be gone here real soon. If not, I'm going to delete the account sometime in the next day or so. I'd rather be shadowbanned and have the vague option of getting the account back someday in a year or two if the admins at that point are okay with restoring it, but I don't really expect them to say yes.

Anyway, in case these are the last words I type since he's actually online at the moment, I would like those last words to be ""thank you"" to the people who have let me into their lives through /r/relationship\_advice. You have meant so much to me and inspired me in ways I can't even articulate. Thank you for trusting a bunch of anonymous Internet people to be there in your darkest moments and to help you make your hardest decisions. Thank you for listening to things you didn't always want to here. You mean the world to me.

Hey guys, I've gotten a few requests this past year, and in the end had a mod contact me about doing this AMA. I'm a fourth year member of The Best Damn Band in the Land, The Ohio State University Marching Band.

Some Proof: http://i.imgur.com/bD8Pe.jpg
These are just the parts of my uniform I had within easy reach. There are quite a few more that aren't pictured.

Although this last halftime in the Nebraska game was among the best shows we've ever done, we're definitely not just a one trick pony(or in this case one pony trick). [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrDNprWcwSA) is a tribute to the Beach Boys. Some of you probably saw the surfer .gif when it was getting upvoted a few weeks ago. Then there's [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfxETOrzpFk&amp;feature=related) of a Hollywood show, including an awesome part with the Titanic and the Pirates of the Caribbean, though the music is hard to hear. In any case, it's definitely worth looking up some of our other shows: while some may have stood out, they've all been excellent.

The band actually has a social media clause, so I want to be very clear that I'm not here in any official capacity. I'm not a director and I'm not speaking for anyone in the band except myself, nor do my opinions reflect those held by the band. That being said, I don't really expect that to be a problem.

Enough about me. The comments I've seen all over the web about this show and about us have shown me that there are a whole lot of misconceptions about the show and about marching band in general(including our band). 
TL;DR Ask me anything about the show, our band, the university, video games and basically anything else. I'll be back around noon to start answering any questions you guys have, and I'll be here basically as long as you ask me questions; we have practice off for today.

I deleted my main account in protest of recent actions by the admins, starting with ""Gawkergate"" and leading to the recent shadowbanning of Scopolamina, AMAA.",168,105,248,http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/16fkld/i_am_syncretic_creator_of_the_sfwporn_network_and/,"I'd like to begin by sharing some personal details about my life outside of reddit. My name is Sean, I'm 27 years old, married to my lovely wife Gina and we have a beautiful 15 month old daughter named Kylie who is absolutely the most important thing in my life right now. One of the reasons I had been neglecting my moderator duties as of late is because I have been spending more and more time with my daughter and less and less time on the computer, which is definitely not a bad thing at all. When she was a younger infant, she spent a lot of time with her mother, since she was breast fed, and I had a lot more free time which meant more time for reddit or going out with friends. Now that she is eating more table food, she is more willing to spend time alone with Daddy and give Mommy a break for a while, and I am loving every minute of it. I particularly love reading books to her, she throws a fit when I get to the last page, and I have to either start over from the beginning or quickly find another book. Her favorites are the ""touch and feel"" books, especially the ones with cats &amp; dogs. Her first word was ""kitty,"" not surprisingly since we have two cats and she chases them around enthusiastically whenever they come within reach.

I teach an after-school and summer program for predominantly low-income K-8th grade student, but I do not (yet) have a college degree. I sort of fell into this job, actually, but it has completely changed my outlook on life and I absolutely love it. I have learned so much about early childhood development and specifically how children learn and how wording things a certain way or in a certain tone of voice can have a dramatic effect on how a child understands what you are trying to teach them that I feel I am even a better father as a result. I feel like I am actually making the world a better place one child at a time and it's the first time in my life that I actually feel satisfied with myself at the end of the work day. I'm often amazed I ended up in this position, considering that I come from a conservative Christian household and my father loathed teachers and psychologists because he believed they were indoctrinating the population with ""the liberal agenda."" I was fed a steady stream of Fox News growing up, and as a result I was a good little republican just like the rest of my family. It seems strange to distinctly remember feeling that liberal politicians were actually *evil* and literally doing the work of the Devil. My father actually believes that Obama is the antichrist... I'm not joking.

My experience on reddit has changed my political beliefs dramatically, first introducing me to libertarianism in 2008 when Ron Paul was all the rage on the front page, and then slowly introducing me to socialism and left-libertarianism. As I learn more and more about the safety net in Europe and experience the horrors of living without health insurance in the United States first hand, I realize how dangerous corporate influence in politics can be. I'm not extremely outspoken politically or active in local politics at all, but I do vote regularly, and I am grateful for Obamacare, considering my wife and I are currently living without insurance and I haven't been to a regular doctor in years (I go to a low-cost local clinic when I am sick). Thankfully my daughter qualifies for free health insurance from the state, or I would be forced to quit the job I love and get a higher-paying job, and since I don't have a college degree, it would be soul-sucking, unskilled manual labor, and I really don't want to go back to that lifestyle. We are so close to the poverty line as it is now, I think if I ever lost the job I have currently, I would simply collect unemployment apply for food stamps / any other government assistance I could get and go back to school full time so I could become a real teacher. I still plan on doing that anyway (going back to school, I mean, not living off the government), except I'm planning to go back part-time in a year or so and take night classes when my daughter is a little older and slightly more self-sufficient (so it won't be so much of a burden on her mother, being alone every day after work). Raising an infant is a stressful, full-time job, and I think if I had to do that and go to school at the same time, my grades would suffer immensely as a result. I have some college hours already, I was even on the dean's list with a 3.8 gpa, but I had to drop out when my dad lost his business, as he was paying for most of it, and he made too much the previous year so I couldn't qualify for financial aid. I was planning on going back to school before now, but life happened, I met my wife, we had a daughter, and I wouldn't change a minute of it for anything in the world, not if it meant I wouldn't have those beautiful blue eyes staring back at me, that precious little voice calling ""dada"" and those adorable little arms wrapped around my neck giving me a hug every day.

I would like to go back to school and pursue a career in education. I would like to be a middle school science teacher, or perhaps an elementary school art teacher, and I would love to volunteer at an after-school program when my normal school day is over, if my workload allows.

My dream job would be working in social media or an online university, I think the internet is the future of education, and hopefully sometime in the near future, higher education will be entirely free and available to everyone. I could never relocate out of state, though, so I think pursuing a teaching career at a nearby local school is my best option. Both my family and my wife's family live within 30 minutes driving distance, and while I am not particularly close with my family (I'm definitely closer with my sister and my grandmother than I am with my father or my uncle, for example), my wife is completely inseparable from hers. She has a large family and we have family get-togethers very frequently, sometimes as often as twice a month. Every holiday and birthday is accompanied with a large family gathering, and they all absolutely love Kylie, I would not want her to be hours and hours away from the people in her life who love her.

I have an account on several private bittorrent trackers, my oldest account having almost 2TB uploaded. I won't mention any names, since it could very well result in my accounts being taken away, depending on how aggressively the individual trackers prohibit mentioning them elsewhere on the internet. My username on all of them is ""syncretic,"" though, so if you're involved in the private tracker community, it's not hard to find me. I'm on most of the big ones.

When I was a teenager I was heavily involved with the ""warez scene"" on Efnet and Linknet. This was during 2000-2004, before bittorrent hit the mainstream and before I matured enough to realize that this was not a game, the risk of federal prison was real and that I probably shouldn't be actively involved in an international music pirating ring. It started with those ""attach an mp3 and hit reply to all"" mailing lists on AOL, really bloomed during the peak of Napster, and then when Napster got shut down I was really hungry for more free music online, which lead me to dcc servers on efnet irc, which put me in contact with people who were actively involved in the larger mp3 scene groups. I started out making ""Tuesday runs,"" which basically involved waking up early on a Tuesday and buying some new album from some new or obscure band, you know, because all of the big names are more sought after and have their stuff leaked prior to the official release date. Eventually I ended up running my own scene group. Bittorrent is much less personal risk, and I have access to more now than I could have ever imagined during my stint in the irc scene. The cloud really is the future of online media.

Let's see, what else... I don't remember 2004-2006 very well, those three years were pretty much a blur of Mountain Dew and WoW. **World of Warcrack. Not even once.**

That about sums it up, I think. Feel free to ask me anything about my online activities, including my stint in the irc piracy scene, my involvement with private torrent trackers (although I still won't mention any tracker names, just basic info about private trackers in general), and my experience in social media, specifically moderating large subreddits, creating new communities and my decision to delete my account in protest to recent admin actions (and inactions) and use hubski as my preferred link aggregator. I reserve the right to ignore questions about my personal life, but feel free to ask anyway, if it's not too intrusive I might answer it. It's not too hard to track down my real name &amp; hometown, but I do prefer to leave my real life separate from my online life, since people tend to say nasty things online that they wouldn't say in person, and if they would say them in person, I really don't want them anywhere near me, my family, or my students.",,False,,t5_2v33w,1357997405.0,,,True,t3_16fkld,http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/16fkld/i_am_syncretic_creator_of_the_sfwporn_network_and/,

I'd like to imagine I'm a funny guy and people enjoy my comments, but in reality it's probably because of my placement of comments. 

I'm conflicted on if everyone can though. I used to think that was the case but when RisingThreads opened I noticed a lot of people trying to karmawhore and there were a lot of just awful comments.

When I mentioned this in a thread here, a mod suggested I submit here.

Long story short. I grew up never knowing my father. From what I knew, he left my mother a few months before I was born and never wanted any contact.

I was raised  being told that he was in prison, he was illiterate, that he wanted nothing to do with me, that he had pushed my mother to absolve him of parental rights, etc. Basically, anything that a young kid might believe to keep me from trying to contact him.

So, there I was. Age 29 (a few months ago), my wife and husband were away on a trip so I had the house to myself and was feeling a little alone and depressed. And I decided that I was going to at least try to find my father.

The next morning, I did some research online using every source I could possibly think of. After an hour or so, I made a phone call. It went to voicemail, because who answers the phone with an unrecognized number?

""Hi, my name is *ReverendDS* and I'm sorry to bother you, but I am looking for my father, *ReverendDS' father*, and my research indicates that you may be related to him or know where he is located.""

""If you have any information that could help me, I would greatly appreciate it if you could call me back at *ReverendDS' number*. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, I apologize for bothering you and hope you have a great day.""

Twenty minutes later, my phone rang. It was from the same area code as the number I had left a message at.

It was my dad.

I had to take the day off and spent the entire day, first on the phone, then on Skype. Meeting my father and my half-sister.

Let's see... I mod for TorChan, the biggest and baddest (i.e. best) imageboard on Tor. I co-admin for AnonChan, another imageboard which went to crap a little less than a year ago. I have janitor duties on Hidden Image Site. I used to be a co-admin for a Reddit clone (gotta love open source) before it went down for an indefinite amount of time. I own a blog, which I update sort of frequently. I may be forgetting something. I'm fairly active on most forums.

Almost all the communities are awesome down there. There's quite an abundance of knowledge and information. I've learned my fair share of IT and crypto-related information in my time lurking.

Anyways, ask me a question. I'll try to answer everything.

/r/standupshots was started because redditors will only watch videos from famous comedians.

After reddit user [Cevian](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cevian) created a comic in [r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/) titled [Dark Captcha Magic](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/eybba/dark_captcha_magic/), he summoned the great deity Inglip, who speaks through ReCaptcha. His cultist followers called Gropagas find themselves in odd, usually funny orders by Inglip or situations. For more info about the basics of Inglip, I suggest you read this introduction post created by my fellow mod [Erivandi](http://www.reddit.com/user/Erivandi) before you continue [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Inglip/comments/16xdnl/an_introduction_to_inglip/). It explains a lot, but it's a little lengthy.

r/Inglip is a writer's/comic maker's dream. It can be used to tell great stories in a fantasy world filled with magic, monsters, war, and technology. So much has been established, that it can be a little daunting to dive into. Thankfully, I have created an updated version of something called the [Inglipnomicon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Inglip/comments/16vzke/the_inglipnomiconnewest_print/) The Inglipnomicon has everything that's considered canon in the Inglipverse. But how exactly does something become canon. Simple. For something to be established in Trathiran lore, it just needs to get 100+ karma on reddit.

You see, lately the activity in r/Inglip has become stagnant, probably due to all that's been introduced. Those who want to join in are lost and move away from it while others think it's just done and nothing more is in store for it. That's hardly the case. Inglip's universe can be so much more, it just needs the activity, which is why I, and my fellow mods, are here. 

We need fantasy writers, artists, and comedians who'd like to delve into this really strange world of Trathira and we'd appreciate if you could join us at r/Inglip!

I got really into anime in my teen years, and when I moved into uni - the freedom turned into an unhealthy spiral of obsessing over 2D girls. 

It got worse when I transferred to a university overseas (Perth). While I tried for a while to 'renew' myself and make friends, my social awkwardness then was horrible and I gave up soon after. 

Went into a hermit stage for probably a good month or two there, only going out when I needed food. Had an alcohol problem too. 

Only after I graduated and got a job (and slowly getting exposed to people) did I move away from that lifestyle. There were a few times over the past years where I almost fell into the hermit (not otaku) trap again, but I managed to avoid it due to good friends and lots of self-reflection. 

I'm typing this on my phone - about to head off to the gym (I have a life now - yay), but I'll be back to answer questions in an hour or two.

1349200981.0,22,self.InternetAMA,10tsws,"I am ""IMadeYouATeeShirt"", Reddit's First Ever Self-Proclaimed Sponsored Novelty Account. AMA",30,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/10tsws/i_am_imadeyouateeshirt_reddits_first_ever/,"Greetings. RedditTreasures and theKingMan were kind enough to request this AMA. I created Reddit's First Ever Self-Proclaimed Sponsored Novelty Account, and you can read all about it in [this blog post](http://www.funnyshirts.org/blog/?p=139).

**Quick summary of the strategy:**

I pay $8.99 for every comment I make as IMadeYouATeeShirt. $5.00 goes to DonorsChoose.org, via RedditDonate.com, in the name of reddit. $3.99 goes directly to reddit in the form of one month of reddit gold for the parent commenter.

IMadeYouATeeShirt is a novelty account in the same vein of Sure_Ill_Draw_That or Shitty_Watercolour, but instead of ink and paper my medium is t-shirt design.

Each comment will have a “footer”. The footer will link to that blog post, it will give the transaction ID of the RedditDonate.com donation, and it will link to the user who just received a month of reddit gold. 

The reason I'm paying money is because, I’m linking back to a site (FunnyShirts.org) that actually sells t-shirts. I realize now a novelty account linking to a commercial website wouldn’t be genuine unless it was completely transparent. Plus, it should pay for its comments. This where the ""sponsored"" part comes into play.

**Latest developments:**

Everything was going really well until Saturday, when it appeared that an Admin banned the account. I explain that situation, and give a rundown of every comment I made in [this blog post](http://www.funnyshirts.org/blog/?p=184).

Obviously you can't see the comments from my original account, [IMadeYouATeeShirt](http://www.reddit.com/user/IMadeYouATeeShirt/) because of the ban, which is why I tried to be so thorough in the above blog post. 

I'm still hoping the original account will be unbanned. Any Admins want to drop me a line?

By age 8 Isaiah had listened to comics such as Blowfly, Redd Foxx, Mom's Mabley and his favorite Richard Pryor. By his teenage years those influences grew to include Richard Jeni, Eddie Murphy, George Carlin, Sam Kinison and Franklin Ajaye. Isai...ah first tried stand-up while attending historically black college Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. Eventhough he was lustily booed during that first performance it gave him the motivation to persue a career as a comedian. So he dropped out of college and lived on campus for a year to hone his craft whilst getting free room and board!

Isaiah became a parent in 1999 when his beautiful daughter Alexis was born. Parenthood meant the dream of being a comedian had to be postponed for more stable work. Isaiah would spend the next 10 years working in the IT field before becoming a victim of the big bad recession. This would be his perfect opportunity to get back into comedy. He loves to perform whenever possible and strives every day to evolve as an artist. Isaiah brings his unique comic perspective, cerebral insight and wit into each and every performance.

Feel free to ask here or there (bit.ly/UPohVV). 

If you've ever tried to learn how to play guitar on the internet, you've probably come across one of our videos. I've been an internet video guitar tutorialist for about 4 and a half years and my team and I have produced hundreds of music instructional videos for free on the internet, most of which are hosted on eHow and Expert Village.

When I first signed on with Expert Village (before they got bought out by Demand Media), I had no idea that these goofy little tutorials were going to launch me into a niche market of a pretty controversial online industry. For better or worse, this work has given me my claim to fame. Somehow, we survived the how-to market boom and bust and have been working on a project called HowToPlayAnySong  for the last few years. Which, of course, is why I'm here.

We've been working our hot little asses off at HTPAS  and we're pretty excited about our fresh re-launch. We've worked with a lot of talented people and been through some ups and downs so we're proud to go live again. Check it out, it's fun!
My areas of expertise are obviously guitar, music gear, music performance, and music culture, but I'd love to hear your thoughts and discussions on internet marketing, internet culture, content farms, how lame the internet how-to industry is, and online education.

**NO**. The remix song was completely made by KeatonKeaton999. He posted the song on a forum in 2006, and asked someone to make a video to it. My video got so popular that a lot of people thought I made the song, no matter how clear I tried to make it that that was not true. This got Keaton very angry with me, and even a special mention on his website for ""stealing"" his song. I have sent him an apology for the confusion, but he did not respond.



&gt;Did you create the gif images in the video?

I made most of those gifs. Not all of them. They were made with a really awesome gif editor that I found a long time ago and now don't remember what it was now that I know how to ~pirate full versions of stuff~.

I have a long history of ""catfishing""- that is, pretending to be other people online. It started at approximately the age of 12, when I would sign into a mobile chatroom under the name ""Punkboy"". This was before the social networking boom- pictures on profiles were still fairly uncommon. I entered a relationship under the Punkboy alias with a very troubled girl. She was morose and suicidal. Our relationship lasted for a year or two, even after my Mother discovered text messages between us and revealed to her that I was actually thirteen and a girl. I got back online and lied, saying that the call was a ""friend"" of mine and it was a joke of sorts.
My second ""catfishing"" incident happened in my first year of high school. Feeling confused by the new social pool, I began to regale the other girls with tales of my ""friends"". I gained popularity. I created Myspace profiles of my ""friends"" and talked to my actual friends under the aliases for a year until finally, that summer, I was exposed. Luckily, I was already transferring into a different school.
The most recent incident is my worst yet. I began to log onto a lesbian chat site after taking a hiatus from college. I used pictures of a girl that I knew. She was attractive but not enough to cause suspicion. I made up fantastical lies- I was a drug dealer, I lived in the hood, I had an ex in jail. I had several relationships via the site. The chatroom was a tightly knit community, with ""popular"" users. I became a popular member, with a reputation for shit talking and ""fucking over bitches."" I soon created yet another profile. Again, a picture of a girl I knew vaguely, attractive but not alarmingly so. She quickly became known as the Internet ""slut"". Nicknamed the ""Phonebone Queen"". I developed her personality even more- she had a child, she was abused, she was an ex-stripper, she was a kind-hearted poet. In a sense she became my martyr. Four chat members fell in love with her. Her and my other profile were good friends/exes. Recently, I killed her off, wanting to lay to rest the endless lies I had been spinning for two years. The chatroom was heartbroken, and others were suspicious. Someone traced my number back to me. I got busted. The girl whose pictures I had been using found out and attempted to press charges for harassment, with no luck. 
Anyway, this post is an attempt to sort my own thoughts since this whole Catfish thing has really fucked my head up. When I first saw the movie Catfish, I felt slightly better- I finally had a name for my....habit? Fixation? and other people did it as well. I felt less alone. It also gave me hope that I could stop one day. It's strange that I do this, because on the surface I am extremely social and outgoing. I was somewhat of a legend at my college. I have plenty of friends. I am gay, with plenty of prospects. I am known for being ""hilarious"". I am overweight, but good-looking. I am intelligent. I don't understand why I do the things that I do. I don't understand why I ""catfish"". I have turned this over in my mind endlessly. My own theory is that I have too much time on my hands, too little stimulation, and an imagination that runs rampant. I enjoyed weaving storylines, creating and playing characters. I enjoyed the drama, elation, arguments, reconciliations, and plot developments. I was happy when I got busted for a few reasons; one being that I was glad that it was finally over. I didn't have to continue with the lies anymore. I was ashamed. My true face was finally shown. I deserved what I got. It felt good for people to see me as what I was- a monster.  
I've also thought about the term ""Catfish"" quite a bit. I know the term was inspired by a quote from the movie: 
""They used to tank cod from Alaska all the way to China. They’d keep them in vats in the ship. By the time the codfish reached China, the flesh was mush and tasteless. So this guy came up with the idea that if you put these cods in these big vats, put some catfish in with them and the catfish will keep the cod agile. And there are those people who are catfish in life. And they keep you on your toes. They keep you guessing, they keep you thinking, they keep you fresh. And I thank god for the catfish because we would be droll, boring and dull if we didn't have somebody nipping at our fin.""
But I don't agree with that definition. I think it's a great term with a rather stupid explanation.  I don't see us ""Catfish"" as prodding any sort of growth or quick thought along. 
We ""Catfish"" are indeed predators, but not for any greater good of the ""cod"". 
Species of catfish are primarily bottom-feeders and scavengers. Their existence falls better in line with the online Catfish.
Online Catfish are scavengers. We take the pieces of different lives to form our own stories. We accept the hollow imitation of life and love that we have created. We are content to live in the dead skin of another.
We are cloaked by murky waters. If you're lucky enough to pull us out, you still risk getting stung.
And eventually, catfish get cooked. ",,False,,t5_2v33w,False,,,True,t3_1c9c0t,http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/1c9c0t/i_am_a_catfish_and_this_is_my_story/,

AMA",19,14,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/1ia0wk/i_am_riningear_been_on_internet_since_age_4/,"I began using the Internet at age 4, mainly for Yahoo! and stuff like that. My interests spanned out to more kids' sites, mainly Nick.com forums, then FunnyJunk and flowgo (when they were still actually good sites) around age 8. 

One interesting experience: I did Disney's VMK obsessively for a while, but my parents apparently filed a lawsuit against one of the Community Leaders because they were being stalkerish. I don't know what happened to that, but even in hindsight, I really don't recall any kinds of stalkerish activities. 

Starting early 2010, I think, I was on 4chan, mainly /b/. In May 2010, I started drawfagging under the name ""Rin"" (which is where my username now is derived from). I was there when multiple drawfags were banned for no reason, myself being one of them. ...Though I've honestly backed out on that community due to 1) drama that I ended up fueling and 2) lack of motivation. Also a broken tablet replaced by a shitty tablet. That would do it. I still keep in touch with some of them via tumblr and Facebook, though. 

Since then, I've joined tumblr, amassing 1000 followers on the latter as a typical ""fandom"" blog. However, I've taken a hiatus on regular usage of tumblr due to how shitty the community is. 

Nowadays I haven't been doing much, but I'm starting to try to get a college major in Internet Culture Studies (an unofficial name since I have yet to work out the technical aspects) by piecing together knowledge from Computer Science, Anthropology, Sociology, and Communications. So I have a lot to say about different online communities, now that I know how to approach them with an unbiased point of view, and with often first-hand experience and engagement. 

I also play Dota 2 and Guns of Icarus Online on a regular basis. I consider myself an egalitarian-based/cyber-/post-structural/intersectionalist feminist. (In other words, I take males and non-white females into account, don't like to support the gender binary, and study feminism in the context of the Internet and computer science.) 

Not expecting to get too much on this, but if you're curious, AMA!

For the first 4 and a half years I created content because I could and I loved it, I still do, I never had a certain genre of videos I uploaded, I have sort of gone through a timeline of them.

I started off in 2008 just filming crappy short films with friends, after a few years my friends just kinda disappeared and left me to do everything on my own.

I've taught myself how to edit semi-professionally and I'm quite good at graphic designing as well.

I've recently started making mainly gaming videos that aren't the generic call of duty montages with dubstep in the background or overdone minecraft bollocks, that is the exact opposite of what I want to be, I also make the occasionally comedy sketch too.

A lot of people have said to me that I deserve a lot more popularity than I get and this AMA totally isn't a publicity stunt at all... ppssshhhhttt.

So yeah, you can see my gaming channel [here] (http://youtube.com/16bittom) so you know what you're up against.

The term ""YouTube famous"" comes from my friends who constantly mock me for working my arse off every single day to produce content and have gotten nothing in return.

I did kill them all, Mostly because FEAR is High Population = Less skilled members. I went ""I just took this whole fucking base, Without any help, I should do this more often"". So I did, I spread to other groups such as RAT, VAK and John's Cobras. But my main target was always and still is Alversian People's Navy. The challenge was there with well-trained members, The leader was rich as all fuck, The fort looked nice and APN is a bunch of dicks anyways. Two years into this fucking war with two accounts hacked. 1 vs 11k+ Motherfuckers. I did kill Bobatheman (Old Leader of APN) when they were attempting to evacuate the island fort with and few friends and a few raiding groups. APN was sold to an user that goes by the name Reaven (New and current leader of APN) because the gang patrols were so great they couldn't  even get into the fucking fort, Let alone manage it and the patrols were 24/7. Then Fort Xie came and that was when I started mapping, I mapped the whole area. The shortcuts, The hidden weapon stashes, The guard patrols, The gate control rooms and of course, THE FLAG. Then Xie was retired and replaced with the Communications Outpost. I'm sure I have a stash of maps of bases and retired bases and training rooms lying around somewhere. I'm helping to finish their miserable asses tonight as they party at the Outpost.

If anyone speaks to me in a sentence that does not contain either a reference to J-Pop, or an anime, you will be ignored, as well as shunned.

If you think you are too good for me, better than me, or simply think you are on the same level as Science. You are wrong and you deserve to go die. Also, whoever made the subreddit /r/atheism deserves to have his arms and legs broken, and to be thrown into a lake full of hungry believers.

Before posting on ***MY*** AMA, please ask yourself this;

Does either,

[This,](http://www.reddit.com/r/popping/comments/yoibk/this_may_not_be_the_appropriate_place_but_i/c5xta25)

or,

[this.]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/109awg/you_thought_the_shoebox_was_bad_my_cousins/)

Do anything for you? If suddenly you are feeling aroused, then this is the AMA for you. Why? you may ask. I dunno, I'm not a faggot and neither do I enjoy yaoi.

Please make all serious responses in the form of copypasta, or a 'Tree Fiddy' story.

What is your favorite anime? If you don't watch anime, I would kindly like to ask you to take a dragon dildo, and shove it up your ass. So far up your ass that it ruptures an organ and you die.

Now, you are probably wondering, ""If this is his AMA, shouldn't he be telling us things about him, so far all he has done is ramble on and ask us questions.""

Well, I suppose you are correct, so let me tell you something about me... wait no, ask me questions you faggots. This is an AMA, if you want to know something ask me science dammit.

Just keep in mind that I won't answer your question unless you meet the criteria outlined earlier in the post.

Now, please enjoy this video

---

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PUhrX5a-J4

^

Please add a six word response to that video to each question you ask me. Follow up questions won't require it but it would be appreciated.

---

At this point you're probably wondering why I'm still adding to this. ""What more could he possibly have to say to us?"" you may be asking yourselves. Well, I decided to ask you one more question! Yeyyyyy.

This is without a doubt the most serious question on this thread. No I am not a weeaboo. No I don't add 'desu' to the end of every sentence (that wouldn't even make sense). Since I'm speaking in english, why the fuck would I replace the word 'cute' with 'kawaii'. No I'm not a faggot, and neither are you if you just keep calm and upvote.

So... uhh, yeah. The question...

Who's your waifu? It's okay, I won't bite your head off if you and I have the same one. I am a civil human being and will appreciate your tastes.

If you want to be my friend, please PM nudes to either me, /u/DIAMOND_OR_NOT_DIAMO, /u/dacvak, /u/bodom2245, /u/Digital_Buddha, or to the /r/jerktalkdiamond modmail bag.

And please send gay porn to /u/dont_buy_me_gold.

I await your questions with enthusiasm.

KEEP THE COMMENTS COMING! MO POINTS MO POINTS MO POINTS!

I was told to come here to tell my short story. Someone about a week ago sent me a message that my information was placed up on a site, (which I was told I can not mention here) about some guys taking pictures of women. The information is correct, but I never even heard of Reddit until a week ago.

Two nights ago, after some heated exchanges with the owner of that website, two men in a Green Ford Prius got out of their car in front of my home and in front of my son, and attempted to attack me. They screamed ""rapists, pedophiles and creepers get what is coming to them."" I hit one of the attackers with a broom and both got in their car and drove off.

It shut him up, at least.  And I've just recently found people using the term.  I sadly cannot provide proof, as real life situations caused me to delete that account.
