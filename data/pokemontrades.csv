I believe that the pokerus should be common courtesy when trading, if you have it, ask the person you're trading with if they want the pokemon you're trading them to be infected with the virus (without it having affect the quality of the trade).

If you're offering the pokerus, make it a giveaway of sorts, I mean its fairly easy to just infect a common patrat with it, and hey, people who are looking for it might trade you something pretty good, just all depends on how giving other people are, but be the first one to be the most giving by offering a ""free"" infected pokemon.

About 2 days ago I made request asking for help from someone to transfer Pokes from a Platinum game onto my HG game. [Here is the original post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/qzwae/4th_need_help_transferring_pokemon_from_used/). 

User **mikikjoe** *FC:* **1547 2552 1350** decided to help me out. 

Everything went well.. or so I thought it did. When I was going to breed a shiny Flygon I was supposed to have gotten from him that was from *my* game, it was no where to be found. It was not in my HG or Platinum game. I then send him a message  informing him that my shiny  Flygon was missing. Two days later I still haven't gotten a reply and checking his account, he's obviously been active. [Here is an image of our PM conversation](http://i.imgur.com/odSAg.jpg). My conclusion? He decided to steal my shiny Flygon in the mess of what was the transferring of 16+ Pokemon. Shiny pokes seemed to be the only thing he was interested in so why not take more from me?

I messaged the mods telling them what I've told you to see if anything can be done about it, but they've not responded either so now I'm making this post to warn my fellow trainers to watch out for this user.

Yeah it gets the point across, but it's inconvenient. 

 I know that I personally am QUITE lazy and want to see the green link or the blue link and search from there, rather than having to open every few links just because i don't know whether they're even applicable to me. but if half the 4th gen posts are blue links because people don't mark them, and half the blue links are either not 5th gen or are other kinds of posts, then it gets super confusing at a surface level.

I know i'm sounding really bitchy about this, but this has gone SIGNIFICANTLY downhill lately. It kind of sucks when all you see in the title is ""need a charmander"". nothing else.

Also, there's a new subreddit, /r/pokemongiveaway. if you need a charmander and have absolutely nothing to offer, go there. if you fail, try to get something interesting to trade and then ask for a charmander offering what you have. 

PRO TIP: There is a 90% chance that someone on this subreddit doesn't have and will want whatever starter you have. breed one, and offer it, then ask what you want in return. 

Guys, i'm so sorry i've been a total tool about all of this and being all angry and stuff, but this is such a great subreddit and has got me so much and I want it to be as amazing as possible for EVERYONE.

&gt; Hello mod, so yesterday lukydude made a post looking for the Nobunaga Event Shiny Rayquaza and offered some shinies. Turns out his shinies were hacked which I told him, and he said he had no prior knowledge which I thought was weird because he managed to obtain the shiny I asked for on the spot. I asked for a pokecheck and turns out it was indeed hacked ([heres the analysis](http://gyazo.com/07aab504b94ea688db2a4082df9a76cb)). So today I noticed he made a new post offering 5 shinies this time, and once again they all seem to hacked, all of them have been caught on March 21, 2012 and hes offering all 5 for the Rayquaza. Anyways there's my story, just wanted to let you know.

I have made out a spreadsheet, strictly banned and blacklisted users. People can check this anytime they want. 

[Here's said spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av3XconGSiKvdFFZckdhYi1yOHN4SkVpRXdORkZGQVE#gid=0)

I hope this helps with identifying not to be trusted codes, as people will try scam again under a new name, but more than likely don't have a second DS system or game to change their code. 

There's no foolproof way to prevent scammers on this sub, so when making a trade when dealing with events and shiny pokemon, be as careful as you can when trading. Never accept a trade without a pokecheck, (don't accept Imgur checks of shinies. Events can be accepted in some cases. Shiny pokemon have no reason to be on imgur) and if you feel the need, ask for a link to their box, so you know this pokemon is theirs, on their account and didn't take a random one from someone else and end up trading a similar hack/clone. If it's a ribboned event, ask who checked their event and ask them about it to make sure they checked that particular event and turned out legit.

Happy trading everyone :)

Edit - great idea from /u/PKM_Trainer_Tye  when making a trade with someone who seems a bit shady, keep your own pokecheck. If they trade you a hack or clone, you can set your own pokemon you traded public, making it worthless to trade and prevents them from gaining a thing out of it.

His friend code is - **2537-5733-2011** DON'T TRUST THIS CODE. He made a second account just to try trade again, who knows if he'll try again.

Regarding trade backs - please, please make sure they are not a brand new user with a 5 minute old account. If it's their first post, I advise not doing tradebacks if someone seems very off/demanding. If they are on an older account, check if they have trading history and a good reputation. This is not the first time pokemon have been stolen.

For trade backs, provide a Pokecheck, people will use hacked pokemon as collateral sometimes and run off, don't trust them without a pokecheck even for tradebacks. Tradebacks are common here, but we have had some incidents where people get scammed unfortunately.

-Please make reasonable offers.  Shiny/ legendaries go for other shiny/legendaries/ rare items/ and maybe RNG'd pokes.

Giveaways are called giveaways for a reason:

-I know this has been said here before but unless you are asking for nothing in return than your giveaway is not a giveaway.  Go ahead and ask for ""donations"" for doing your giveaway but do not demand anything in return.

It's not hard, there are some guidlines on www.pokecheck.org on the front page.

I don't really know how everyone else feels about hacked Pokemon, but I saw a post a few days ago about how it decreases the value of legit pokes so I would say keep the hacked trades to a minimum or just don't do them(after all what's the point of cheating).

***cryo's Trading Guide For Beginners***

------------------------------------------------------------

Hey you.  Yeah, you with the hat.  I know you want to be the very best.  But to be better than anyone ever was, you've gotta learn the rules of the game.  You thought catching that Mewtwo in a pokeball was hard work?  Try trading it for a Darkrai.  No luck? That's what I thought.  If you want to build up an awesome pokemon collection, you've simply got to be informed about the whole process.  You've got to know what's worth what in order to make the most out of your trades.  And be patient.  You're not going to go from nothing to everything in a week unless you cheat.  And cheaters suck, so don't cheat bro (or lady bro).  But don't worry.  I'm here to give you some (maybe) helpful tips to get you started.

------------------------------------------------------------

**HOW TO TRADE**  (this portion of the guide courtesy of Hypobasis)

First off, there's two ways to trade.

* Using the GTS

* Using r/pokemontrades

Both require you to have a WiFi connection to connect to. The WiFi needs to be secured with WEP encryption or no encryption at all (unsecured). However, if your DS is a DSi or DSi XL (not the original model or the DS lite) you can use WPA encryption. Basically, if your DS has a camera and doesn't have a GBA slot then you can use WPA.

So, in summary, Original Model DS and DS lite only support open connections and wep connections
DSi and DSi XL support WEP, Open and WPA networks.

If you own an older model, without WPA support, and you don't want to/can't mess with your router, your best bet is to head to a starbucks or McDonald's and take advantage of the free wifi they have.
Next, lets assume your connection is compatible with your DS. You need to get it setup with your connection. To do this, start up your Pokemon game and select ""Wi-Fi Connection Settings"". After that, follow this guide.
Right, now your all set up to trade. Lets say, for example, you wanted a Magikarp and your offering a Elekid. So, in r/pokemontrades, you'd click ""Submit a link"" and change to the ""text"" tab. Next, you'd in the title box, you'd put the generation your game is.

The reason we need to do this is because 4th generation games are incompatible with 5th generation games. That way we don't get confused on what game your trading for.

If your game is Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heart Gold, or Soul Silver, your game is a 4th generation game.

If your game is Black, White, Black 2, or White 2, your game is a 5th generation game.

 So, in the title box you'd type [4th] or [5th] then what your looking for and what you have. So, in this case it would be ""[4th] Looking for a Magikarp, offering Elekid"".

Then, you wait. Once you get an offer in the comments, you need to exchange friend codes. You can find and register friend codes using the ""Pal Pad"" item in your key items box in your games inventory. You both need to exchange friend codes to trade. Use the ""Your friend code"" option to see your friend code, and use ""register friend code"" to add the other guy to your friend code list.

Finally, you need to head to a pokecenter. In 4th gen games, you'll need to go downstairs, in 5th gen games you head upstairs. Talk to the lady in the middle, who asks you if you want to go into the Wi-Fi club. Agree, save and enter the wi-fi club. Run up to the TV on the opposite end of the room and press A, set your status to ""Trade"" and wait till your partner goes online and accepts your invite. After that, it's fairly self explanatory.
If your buddy is online, run up to him on the top screen and press A to accept his invite.
That's all it takes! Happy trading!

------------------------------------------------------------

***Value Tiers*** *(A loose guide.  Not to be taken as Law)*

* Tier 1: Shiny Events.  (Old Sea Map Mew, Birth Island Deoxys, Flower Paradise Shaymin, Newmoon Island Darkrai, Ranger Manaphy)  Hard to determine Legitimacy.  Only trade with trusted users.

* Tier 1.5: Super Rare Events.  Mostly very old in-person limited and mostly foreign events.  Stuff like Space C Deoxys and other rare Gen 3 and Early Gen 4 events go here.  Like Tier 1 stuff,  often hard to determine legitimacy.

* Tier 2: Rare Events.  Mostly in-person stuff.  The older and more limited in distrobution, the more valuable.  Lots of foreign events go here.  Dream world starters go here.

* Tier 3: Shiny Legends.  The in-game stuff.  People's value on these vary a lot.  Can be relatively simple to obtain if you are talented at RNG.  Gen 3/4 stuff is usually worth a little more than Gen 5.

* Tier 4: Regular Events.  All other events.  Most all wifi events go here.  Stuff that's widely available.  The more recent and more available, the less valuable.  Pretty big gap in value from the most valuable stuff I'd put in this tier to the least.  (e.g. Plasma Deoxys would be at the bottom of this list at the moment, and some of the more common 4th gen WiFi events would probably be at the top.  Needless to say, the two are not equal in value, and you probably won't find anyone willing to do a 1:1 trade.)

* Tier 5: Breedable Shinies.

**----MASSIVELY HUGE VALUE DROP----**

* Tier 6: Dream World Legends

* Tier 6.5: In-game Legends

* Tier 7: DWF Breedables [*Currently Available DW Pokemon*](http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/list-of-released-dream-world-pokemon-mark-ii.3454925/)

* Tier 8: Standard breedables.

**The RNG FACTOR** - As far as RNGed stuff goes, it depends on the person.  Some people value them more and some people value them less than normally encountered pokemon.  This just has to be considered on a case-by-case basis.  If you want to learn more about RNG, head to /r/pokemonrng

No quantity of T6-T8 is really worth anything above to most users.  One item from any tier is worth approximately 2-3 from the tier below (again, a general guideline, not a rule).  For the half tiers, they're broken down that way because I've seen stuff traded 1:1 between them in some cases.  And 2:1 from a half tier for the tier above might be overpaying in most cases.  As an example, I've seen trades where someone might trade 1 from Tier 1.5 and 1 from tier 2 or 3 for a Tier 1.  And even within the same tiers, like I mentioned in Tier 4, there is often a lot of gap in value, to where a 1:1 trade within the tier isn't really fair.  This is something that you'll just have to pick up on over time, and not really something I can feasibly lay out in a guide like this.

Obviously in the end, stuff is worth what people are willing to trade for, so as I mentioned above, these tiers are only meant to be helpful guidelines, not strict rules.  Just don't be dissapointed because no one wants to trade their Mew for your Cobalion.  Just do some reasearch on events and watch other trade threads, and you'll easily start to pick up on the proper values of things.

Outside of that, some things can on occasion rise and fall in value outside of the rest of their tier.  Usually cases like this are all supply and demand.  Somebody posted a trade of a bunch of old events they farmed 2 years ago but have just been collecting dust in a box?  They'll probably let them go for a value.  Again, just hang out long enough and you'll pick up on this stuff.

***ALL POKEMON FROM TIER 5 AND UP ARE REQUIRED TO BE POKECHECKED TO BE TRADED ON /R/POKEMONTRADES***  [Find out how to do this here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jg6mx/announcement_how_to_use_pok%C3%A9check_a_quick_guide/)

------------------------------------------------------------

**A Note on Gen 3 Events:**  As several users have pointed out, trading Gen 3 events can often be a tricky process.  The fact is simply that the games have been out for so long that the stuff is really easy to hack.  And not only that, but its easy to hack and appear legal on pokecheck (as it wasn't ever really designed for Gen 3 stuff).  My advice on this is to just use extra caution when trading these, and make sure you trust the person offering them.  Don't be afraid to ask in the pokecheck shoutbox for a second opinion on legitimacy.

A similar caution should be used around Shiny Events/Legends.  There are a few ways to spot hacks that appear legal at first glance, so again just use some extra caution and discretion.  There ARE legit versions of these that exist, (that users here do have) you just have to be a little more careful.

------------------------------------------------------------

**Bartering** - Honestly, most of the people who you're going to trade with are HORRIBLE salesmen/women.  Learn to barter.  If you're making an offer to someone else, always lowball it.  Gradually come up until either they trade or you aren't willing to give up any more.  On the flip side, if you're taking offers, don't necessarily just jump on every good offer.  If you reject an offer, they'll either up it (since they followed my advice and lowballed you), or they'll give up.  You can always go back and accept the original offer though if this happens.  Like anything else, it just takes practice.  And to really effectively barter, you've got to have a really good grip on what stuff is worth.

***SUPER PRO TIP*** - Be nice to people, and don't take advantage of somebody who doesn't know their TRU Arceus isn't worth your crappy Bold Kyogre.  Enlighten them instead.  Negotiate a fair bargain, but don't abuse your new found knowledge.  Scamming is for losers, son.

------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, my best advice to someone just getting started in trading is to make sure you farm the crap out of the next available wifi event.  (Stay tuned to sites like [Serebii.net]( http://serebii.net/index2.shtml) to find out when they are going to happen.)  And I'm talking like, 60 of them. Wait for a month or so after the event's over and try to trade off 10-20 for some other lower-valued events or shinies (doesn't matter what, they're just trade fodder. They're your new currency.) Then wait another couple months and try trading another batch. Except now chances are better that more people may want one if they missed the event, and now you have some other events and shinies to throw in the mix to trade up the ladder. Keep repeating this process over the next year or two, and you should have yourself a pretty awesome collection. I know that's not the answer you wanted to hear, but like anything, a (legit) pokemon collection takes time and effort to obtain.

Another shorter-term option would be to learn how to RNG shinies, and simply trade them for what you can.

1362246564.0,39,self.pokemontrades,19j434,[Question] Can the users here post better?,49,10,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/19j434/question_can_the_users_here_post_better/,"Sorry if the title isn't great, I don't want to offend anyone. The following is not to bitch about the subreddit or call anyone out, it is simply to enlighten the members of this community in hopes of improving the subreddit. 

Basically it seems that recently people have not been making the best judgement with trades. For example I think we all need to really think about what would constitute a ""fair"" trade. The most erroneous example of this seems to be people offering in-game shinies (LoR Gyarados, NP Haxorus) for other shinies. These offers are clearly not fair, and can get rather annoying as they always seem to appear at least once a trading post. **An in-game shiny is *generally* not worth more than a breedable or another in-game shiny**. I know some users point out that they won't accept these offers, but can it be considered reddiquette not to even offer them?

My next point is over the actual rules themselves. It seems that recently several traders here are disregarding them. In the last few days here I've seen a few being broken. 

-No Giveaways.

-Post a Pokecheck.

-Use proper post formats.

For the first one, I know people want to be generous here, which is great, but /r/Pokemongiveaway is where that should happen. It just clogs up the front page to do it.

As for posting a pokecheck, this one really needs to be followed. People can hack, we have to face the fact that the honor code does not apply here. It is a main essential for a rare pokemon. /u/Tyranitard (who is a mod here) even made a video to help people out with Pokechecking, and there is a guide on the Pokecheck home page. The excuse ""I don't have a Pokecheck because I don't know how"" doesn't work. If you really do need more help, simply ask a question and the people here would be willing to help you.

Finally, I know /u/Automoderator does a great job scanning the submissions, but a few slip by to the front page without the proper formatting. The thing is, it only takes a second to check what formatted heading you need. Heck, I was going to use [Meta] as my format until I checked to see what I could use. It's not hard and it makes the front page look cleaner. 

As a final note I just want to say that nothing I have mentioned is the mod's fault. I know a lot of the mods here work behind the scenes to keep this place running great. Really what we have to remember is that the mods are the authority in this community, but that doesn't mean they are mommy and daddy cleaning up our mistakes. If we all want to have a great community here, we need to take a little responsibility. Check the rules before posting and use a little reddiquette. If we do this, we can make /r/pokemontrades a community we all can enjoy. So I ask all of you, ""Can the users here post better?"".

1359856776.0,40,self.pokemontrades,17s9wu,[Announcement] You can pokecheck your ribbon event pokemon without a flash cart.,42,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/17s9wu/announcement_you_can_pokecheck_your_ribbon_event/,"So reading the recent announcement, I saw that a lot of people had trouble pokechecking event pokemon with ribbons. They had to hassle users with flash carts so they could extract the pokemon and upload them. Here's a solution I found out that you can do yourself, WITHOUT buying a flash cart. There's a fair bit of setup involved initially, but once you get started, it's easy. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it!

**Step 1**: Download the Desmume emulator WIFI edition.  
**Step 2**: Get it set up with the proper BIOS and firmware files. You'll have to google this yourself, there's plenty of guides out there.  
**Step 3**: Download a ROM of the Pokemon version you own (technically this isn't illegal, as you own the game).  
**Step 4**: Start a new game on it and get up to the point where you can trade on the GTS/WFC. Alternatively, you can just download a save file that is past that point.  
**Step 5**: Ensure that you actually can trade on the GTS, so you know that the emulator's networking is working correctly.  
**Step 6**: Register the friend codes of your legit game (the one with the event pokemon on it) and the emulator game.    

Right, so that's all the initial setup done.    

**Step 7**: Trade your event pokemon to the emulator game in the WiFi Club room (the middle one in B/W/B2/W2).  
**Step 8: BACKUP THE SAVE FILE. It now has your event pokemon, you don't want to accidently lose it.**  
**Step 9**: Use a save file editor such as Pokegen to extract it as a pkm file.  
**Step 10**: Upload it to Pokecheck.    

I've successfully done this on my PC, that is on the same router providing the WiFi for my DSi. It works. I have a feeling that most people will get stuck connecting the emulator game to the WFC/GTS, **but it is critical that you get this working**. Just google ""GTS desmume"" and you'll see plenty of guides pop up. I won't link to any here because I don't want to get in trouble, but the thread on romulation has a very good guide. It should be the first search result on google.

Your Pokemon will be worth something similar. End of story.

1372714020.0,31,self.pokemontrades,1hgbdp,"A community discussion regarding the [Question] of Legality, Illegality, and Legitimacy.",37,6,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1hgbdp/a_community_discussion_regarding_the_question_of/,"At the request of several users, I've decided to not give up on this great community as easily as I was ready to after a pretty frustrating conversation with one of the mods (MrJAPoe) last night.  For those that missed it, the main comment thread [can be read here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1hdctg/question_farming_and_legality/cat94z6)  

Basically, MrJAPoe and I have different definitions for what Legit, Legal, and Illegal means in regards to pokemon being traded here.  He laid down his personal interpretation of the rules as law, despite there being no clear definitions anywhere on this page.  The rule on the sidebar simply states the following:

* *Trading Hacked, Cloned, Illegal or scamming for Pokemon will result in a ban.*

No explanations, no definitions.  And especially in light of all of the events from the past couple of weeks, I feel like this community needs to come together to voice their thoughts and clearly and explicitly define what all of these terms mean.  I will be putting forth what I propose to be the new definitions, as judging by the PM responses I got last night and the upvoting/downvoting of my discussion with the mod, I believe my stance is the one held by the vast majority of this community.

Defining Legality:

* A pokemon shall be considered legal if it has no clear signs of being hacked or edited.  Legal pokemon will have no red flags on pokecheck, and will hold up under scrutiny when checked against others in the pokecheck database.  A pokemon must check legal to be traded in this subreddit.  Legality does not and can not, however, speak to the source of the pokemon.

Defining Legitimacy:

* A pokemon shall be considered legit if and only if it checks as legal and the *source* of said pokemon is the original and intended source.  An event pokemon will be considered legit if it comes from a *unique* wondercard downloaded from an official Nintendo source (Nintendo WFC, Local WiFi at participating locations, or infrared) during the official time frame of the event.  The *destination* of the event does not change its legitimacy (e.g. Flashcart vs. Retail)

Breaking down Illegality:

* **Hacks** - Any pokemon that does not originate from the original, intended source.  This includes anything and everything generated by action replay, pokemon generating websites and apps, pokemon edited by 3rd party software, and illegal wondercards.  Abusing saves to re-use wondercards is illegal (be it on a rom or retail).  Some hacks can look 100% legal.

* **Clones** - Any pokemon that is not the original, unique version directly obtained from the original source.  Anything downloaded through pokecheck is a clone.  Some 4th gen Static PID events can be clones, yet still Legit.  This is to be determined on a case by case basis.

Now, as was the case in the thread last night, the main point of disagreement seems to be in the legitimacy section regarding the destination of an event changing its legality.  I personally see this as the exact same issue as RNGing.  RNGed pokemon are Legit, as they are 100% generated by your game.  Some people prefer not to use them though, as they feel that it goes against the original, or pure, intent of the game.  And its fully everyone's right to decide that for themselves.  The solution developed for this sub was simply that any RNGed pokemon offered for trade need to be identified as such.  As a solution to this current issue, I propose a new rule be added that states if a pokemon being offered for trade comes from a rom, it needs to be identified as such so people can decide for themselves whether they want to trade or not.

So that's what I've got.  If you agree with what I've said, let us know.  If you disagree, or just have something to maybe add or tweak, let your voice be heard as well!  I've been a part of many different gaming communities over the years, and all that were successful were communities governed by and for the people.  MrJAPoe said in our discussion yesterday that he does listen to the community, so I truly hope that whatever the consensus is here is what will be officially enforced, even if it goes against his personal preferences.  And if it is decided that I am in the wrong and am in fact a dirty rotten hacker, I will accept the community's decision and take my leave.

*edit for typos.

*edit2 for some additional thoughts:

Some people seem to, at least in some small way, perceive me to be advocating cheating by defending the use of flashcarts.  Allow me to try and clear this up.

While it is true that many methods of manipulation and cheating are made easier through the use of flashcarts, this fact has *absolutely no bearing* on the issue at hand regarding legality and legitimacy.  Just because something can be used in one way does not mean that it *has to* or *can only* be used in that way.  Yes, plenty of illegitimate pokemon are created through the use of roms and flashcarts.  However, plenty of illegitimate pokemon are also created on retail carts through various methods.  Similarly, legitimate pokemon can be obtained on both flashcarts and retail carts when holding to the definitions outlined above.

This confusion serves to highlight the most crucial part of my definition of legitimacy, and the reason for this entire thread.

tl;dr -  The **source** of a pokemon determines its legitimacy, not its **location** or **legality**.",,False,,t5_2rmov,1372780097.0,,cryo,True,t3_1hgbdp,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1hgbdp/a_community_discussion_regarding_the_question_of/,

When your making an exotic trade, say, a Shiny Groudon or something, you need to give a pokecheck report of the new Pokemon. 

**Why do you need to do this?**

* It proves that you actually have said Pokemon
* It allows people who want to trade with you to see exactly what they are getting
* It allows everyone to see a legality analysis of said Pokemon.

It's not perfect, but it's enough to give us an overview of the Pokemon.

* Note, if your just trading off regular Pokemon, it's fine. You don't need to do a Pokecheck analysis of your Bidoofs, but feel free to do so if you want.

**For those of you who've never used Pokecheck:**

PokeCheck is a stat checker that works as if it's the GTS. It allows you to see ALL of the pokemon stats. It works by ""uploading"" your pokemon to a fake GTS and reading all the data as it goes through.

Your Pokemon doesn't actually leave your game (the server ""rejects"" the Pokemon) so there's no need to worry about having your Pokemon stolen or anything.

**How do do a Pokecheck Analysis?**

* First, follow the steps on the main page of [PokeCheck](http://pokecheck.kraftpaper.org/). In the end, you should have changed ""Auto Obtain DNS"" to ""off"" and changed the ""Primary DNS"" to the address on the Pokecheck site.

* Load up your save and talk to the lady on the far right of the second floor of the PokeCenter, and select ""Global Trade"" then ""GTS"".

* This will start up the GTS, you enter the room and be given the option to deposit, view a summary or seek a pokemon. Select deposit and select the Pokemon you wish to do the PokeCheck analysis for and deposit it into the GTS. To be on the save side (in case you got the DNS settings wrong or something) look for something impossible, like a level 0 -9 Charizard or something, that way if it does upload your Pokemon to the real GTS it will be unlikely that someone will take it right away.

* If all goes well, you should see an error code that ends in ""66"". If you don't see that error code. If the Deposit goes through without an error, you got the DNS settings wrong. If you get an error that ends in ""67"", you either have a hacked pokemon, or have a pokemon that has a name with a profane word in it (Corafagious actually counts for this, you have to nickname him in order to upload him to the GTS).

* Assuming you got error 66, head to back to [PokeCheck](http://pokecheck.kraftpaper.org/) in your web browser and click ""See unclaimed Pokemon from my IP"". (Note the device you browse pokecheck on needs to be on the same network as your DS, you can't use a phone with pokecheck unless it's on WiFi).

* You should now see your pokemon on that list, click on him to see a report.

* At the bottom of the pokemons page, click the button that says ""Show legality analysis"". Assuming your Pokemon isn't hacked, copy the URL into your post on r/pokemontrades. Also grab a screenshot by clicking the ""Download screenshot with legality analysis"" button. Upload the resulting screenshot to imgur and include it in your post.

EDIT: Update, you have to make an account and ""claim"" the pokemon to link to a Pokemon. I suggest doing that, but if you don't want to, the screenshot alone will suffice.

* Finally, got back into your Wi-Fi settings and change Auto-Obtain DNS back to

**Example**


For example, here's a post I'd make for my Shiny Groudon:

*Offering Shiny Groudon*

Hey dudes, I got myself a Shiny groudon, and I'm taking offers on it.

Here's the [Pokecheck Analysis](http://pokecheck.kraftpaper.org/?p=detail&amp;uid=119461) and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/vdoCu.png) the legality analysis.


**What should I be looking at in a Analysis?**

* First, make sure the legality analysis screenshot and the link to the Pokemons page on Pokecheck match up. Make sure they aren't Photoshopped. Check the name in the legality analysis, the shiny status, all that jazz. Also, check to see if the font match up. Use my links above as a template, that's what the font SHOULD look like.

* On the Pokemon page, click the OT's. This shows uploaded Pokemon from OT's with that name. This isn't 100% accurate though, so take it at face value. Also, be sure to check the OT's trainer ID and game against the ones you see on that list. Use mine as an example, there are a few ""Hiro's"" from diamond and pearl anda  few of them have uploaded hacked pokemon, but none from emerald like my groudon.

* Finally, check the age of the Reddit account that's posting it, brand new accounts or accounts that haven't made a lot of trades can be pretty suspicious.

**The person offering a shiny didn't do a Analysis, what do I do?**

Plain and simple: Don't make any offers until they do one. Demand one in the comments.

The person may have not see the warnings or something, or some other reason.

If they constantly refuse to do a Analysis, your probably looking at a hacker, avoid him and hit the mods up with a message linking to the thread.

**Final Notes:**

I highly suggest making an account on PokeCheck, it allows you to keep your Pokemon permanently and see all their stats. SUPER useful with EV's.

1300749668.0,35,self.pokemontrades,g8io8,[Guide] Quick guide to trading in both the 4th and 5th generations.,40,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/g8io8/guide_quick_guide_to_trading_in_both_the_4th_and/,"Hey guys, we got a few requests on how to trade, I thought I'd write up a quick guide on how to do it so nobodys confused.

First off, there's two ways to trade.

* Using the GTS
* Using r/pokemontrades

Both require you to have a WiFi connection to connect to. The WiFi needs to be secured with **WEP** encryption or no encryption at all (unsecured). However, if your DS is a DSi or DSi XL (not the original model or the DS lite) you can use **WPA** encryption. Basically, if your DS has a camera and doesn't have a GBA slot then you can use WPA.

So, in summary:

* Original Model DS and DS lite only support open connections and wep connections
* DSi and DSi XL support WEP, Open and WPA networks.

If you own an older model, without WPA support, and you don't want to/can't mess with your router, your best bet is to head to a starbucks or McDonald's and take advantage of the free wifi they have.

Next, lets assume your connection is compatible with your DS. You need to get it setup with your connection. To do this, start up your Pokemon game and select ""Wi-Fi Connection Settings"". After that, follow [this](http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/connect.jsp) guide.

Right, now your all set up to trade. Lets say, for example, you wanted a Magikarp and your offering a Elekid. So, in r/pokemontrades, you'd click ""Submit a link"" and change to the ""text"" tab. Next, you'd in the title box, you'd put the generation your game is.

The reason we need to do this is because 4th generation games are incompatible with 5th generation games. That way we don't get confused on what game your trading for.

If your game is:

* Diamond
* Pearl
* Platinum
* HeartGold
* SoulSilver

Your game is a **4th** generation game.

If your game is:

* Black
* White

Your a 5th generation game. So, in the title box you'd type [4th] or [5th] then what your looking for and what you have. So, in this case it would be ""[4th] Looking for a Magikarp, offering Elekid"".

Then, you wait. Once you get an offer in the comments, you need to exchange friend codes. You can find and register friend codes using the ""Pal Pad"" item in your key items box in your games inventory. You both need to exchange friend codes to trade. Use the ""Your friend code"" option to see your friend code, and use ""register friend code"" to add the other guy to your friend code list.

Finally, you need to head to a pokecenter. In 4th gen games, you'll need to go downstairs, in 5th gen games you head upstairs. Talk to the lady in the middle, who asks you if you want to go into the Wi-Fi club. Agree, save and enter the wi-fi club. Run up to the TV on the opposite end of the room and press A, set your status to ""Trade"" and wait till your partner goes online and accepts your invite. After that, it's fairly self explanatory.

If your buddy is online, run up to him on the top screen and press A to accept his invite.

That's all it takes! Happy trading!",,False,,t5_2rmov,False,,,True,t3_g8io8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/g8io8/guide_quick_guide_to_trading_in_both_the_4th_and/,moderator

Well, I have almost all level 1 shinies, and would love to distribute these beautiful mofo's. If anyone has paid any attention, I haven't traded in a while, mainly collecting these shinies. 

You may request 1 shiny. 

They **CANNOT** be nicknamed. 

First come first served. I will look at time stamps. 

Give me back whatever I'm giving you. I don't want a bunch of the same stupid shit. 

EDIT on legality analysis. Since I don't feel like doing each one individually through imgur, you can pokecheck it, and if it is not to your liking then I will take it back from you. I will however post a pokecheck link to my box that has all of these shinies in it, but you wont be able to the legality analysis. Sorry for any inconvenience. 

I won't be home until 3PM central tomorrow, and that's when I'll hopefully be able to start trading. 

If you think I'm trying to scam you, that makes no sense, and you can lose out on a shiny.

I know a few of you haven't read the sidebar, read over it, and feel free to message us moderators any questions. I and other mods do read all the messages that come through daily.

1 - **Pokechecks!**As the address bar says, pokecheck of any valuable pokemon MUST have a pokecheck. I will accept NO reason for you to agree to a trade where a person doesn't post a pokecheck.

* ''It has a ribbon and can't be checked'' WRONG. There are users who can post pokechecks of your events, the most trustworthy being /u/tone21, /u/DanTheRip, /u/DevinXtreme and /u/PlUmPaSsChIcKeN. They are not always around and are busy themselves, so they can't get a check all the time. However, not posting pokechecks is against the rules. Alternatively, if you agree to a trade where you didn't ask for a pokecheck, don't be surprised if you get a hacked pokemon.

* ''I have a bad internet connection'' I just won't accept this at all.

* Pokemon like events  (Mew, Shaymin, Darkrai, Keldeo, Jirachi etc) must have pokechecks, as do shinies and DW starters. No exceptions. Do not post imgur checks if you can avoid them. The people who check events may keep them on pokecheck for a limited amount of time. I personally don't accept imgur checks. It's easy to edit a photo that's screen capped and HAS happened before. 

2 - **Even trades!** I have seen a couple people trying to get events for their Phiones. PHIONE IS NOT A LEGENDARY. It is a breedable pokemon and I have/had about 3 boxes of them at one stage. Manaphy though, is an event. This is because Phione can never evolve. It maybe the offspring of an event, but that means nothing. 

Shinies go for other shinies and events/DW starters.

Events go for other events and shinies and DW starters.

In some cases, DW legends can go for shinies if you feel it's fair, some users take different opinions on this.

However, starters, breedable pokemon, EV trained pokemon/IV bred pokemon aren't worth shinies/events/DW starters. In most cases, DW starters are hacked so asking them usually will result in nothing.

3 - **Rudeness!**. I do not like rude people and you have no place on this subreddit if all you want to do is nitpick and complain. It's not the type of community we are. 

4 - **A new rule, please state if your pokemon is RNG'd or not** It's common courtesy. If they are not RNG'd, please represent them as such. There are users who do not like RNG.

5 - **Absolutely no giveaways.** Don't post here if you looking for something but nothing to offer/giving away stuff. There's /r/pokemongiveaway for that reason. HOWEVER, don't go to that community if you want shinies or events, as asking them for free over there is just greedy and you'll be directed back here.

**Side note** - DanTheRip and Devinxtreme can't check events currently, so you can't ask them to check right now, so I apologize to them if their inboxes have been completely spammed. I am unsure about /u/tone21 however.

Please don't make this look like me telling everybody what the law is of this subreddit because that's completely contrary to my point.  Please tell me what you're opinions are.**

Now, this community is very noble.  I rarely see anyone trying to cheat people out of the poor new guy who is offering a shiny for a starter or something.  In fact, I see many people going onto these threads and explaining to the rookie the value of what he actually has.  And, if someone attempts to take advantage of one of these people, the community stops the trade.

This is noble and completely understandable.  I respect you all for this.  But I don't think that a lot of people are making a good conversion from the capitalistic system of the real world to the loose barter system of /r/pokemontrades.  The fact of the matter is that we can't assign set values to Pokemon.  We can assign general values, but we can't definitely say that Rattata is more valuable than Bidoof.  Shiny is definitely far more valuable than Rattata, but there's a huge difference between these two general values and their rarity.

When we enter into the legendary/event/shiny tier, it's much more vague.  You can't definitely say that shiny Pupitar is more valuable than shiny Drowzee.  Say I'm offering said shiny Drowzee.  John may offer his shiny Pupitar, but I decline because I'm looking for something more valuable.  Then, Bob comes onto my thread and he *really* wants a shiny Drowzee.  Drowzee is his favorite Pokemon after all!  Bob offers me shiny Rattata, but I'm not interested.  Bob then offers his Arceus, but I'm not interested still.

Now, Bob still really wants my shiny Drowzee, and he fears that someone else will get it.  He makes a last ditch effort by offering both his Arceus *and* his shiny Rattata.  This is where I see a lot of people jump in and attack the person who's running the thread when they eagerly jump on a chance to make some profit. Bob has completely justified this trade in his mind.  He doesn't feel like he's being ripped off, and he is completely willing to make this trade.  I haven't gone and held his arm behind his back to make him give up these shinies in an unfair trade.  Bob came to *me* with this offer, and he knows exactly what he's doing.  

It's not /r/pokemontrades' place to stonewall this trade because they don't value shiny Drowzee as much as Bob genuinely does.  This is because we are operating in a barter system.  There is no set value for each Pokemon.  It varies from person to person.  We can't go around pretending like we know the exact value of each and every Pokemon that's being offered because you don't.  Not everybody follows your line of thinking.  This is what makes the world a diverse and great place, and it's *supposed* to be the entire point of Reddit.  But we're not gonna get into that pool.

So, if you don't like a trade, don't make it.  And I don't mean to deter people from stopping the genuinely unfair trades.  Please continue to do this.  It's awesome, and I really respect your selflessness, but don't attack OP because the person he's trading with doesn't value everything the same as you.

Thank you for reading, and everybody have a great night.  Happy trading!

-- OldBreed4816

TL;DR: This is a barter system.  Please don't pretend like you know the value of a Pokemon.

Today I threw out the old CSS based tagging system in favour of the new automatic system created by [Extreme Popcorn](http://bigfriendlyrobot.reddit.com).

I've removed all of the current tags, so you'll need to resubmit your friend codes. The process is pretty quick, however it'll probably take 10 to 15 minutes to show up, so be patient.

To get a new tag you will need click [this](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=BigFriendlyRobot&amp;message=[4th]+XXXX-XXXX-XXXX+[5th]+XXXX-XXXX-XXXX&amp;subject=pokemontrades) link and replace the X's with your friend codes and press send.

For example, I would put:

&gt; [4th] 0617-9789-2401 [5th] 0617-9789-2401

If you only have one game, send only that friend code with the generation before it, for example:

&gt; [4th] 0617-9789-2401

or

&gt; [5th] 0617-9789-2401


In case anyone doesn't know which generation of game they have

Fourth generation games:

* Diamond
* Pearl
* Platinum
* HeartGold
* SoulSilver

Fifth generation games:

* Black
* White


Again, it should take 10 to 15 minutes to show up. If you did it wrong, it will tell you.

When your tag has been added, you should be able to see it under the ""frontpage"" button on the side bar.

If you want to update your tag (new DS or a new game) just repeat the same process.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!",,False,,t5_2rmov,False,,,True,t3_jjqxl,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/jjqxl/announcement_new_flair_based_friend_codes/,moderator

1375306178.0,26,self.pokemontrades,1jg6mx,[Announcement] How to use Pokécheck - A quick guide,30,4,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jg6mx/announcement_how_to_use_pokécheck_a_quick_guide/,"This guide aims to explain how to setup/use Pokécheck to trade on this subreddit.
I know there is a video guide on the sidebar, but I've never been a fan of videos. So without further ado, here's the how to.

*****

Pokécheck is a website that is used to conduct legality analysis of Pokémons. In a GTS-like fashion, it allows you to upload a copy of your pokémon on Pokécheck's server (your pokémon remains unaffected in your game). From there, you can view your pokémon's stats as well as other pieces of information about it.

**Prerequisites:**

* A DS/DSi/3DS/3DS XL
* A Generation 4 (Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold and SoulSilver) or Generation 5 (Black, White, Black 2 and White 2) game
* A working Wifi access

**Step 1: Creating an account on Pokécheck**

Pokémons deposited on Pokécheck must be claimed by their owner. If they are not claimed 24 hours after being deposited, they will be made public. To avoid any issues, create an account on the site first. Don't forget to pick a strong password.

**Step 2: Account options**

While we are at it, let's set up your account for trading. Click on ""Account options"". I encourage you to select the following options:

Option|Explanation
:---|:---
Show legality analysis by default|This will save you the effort of clicking on ""Show legality analysis"" while viewing a pokemon's page
Allow other users to see the legality analysis of my non public Pokémon|Self-explanatory, but mandatory for trading on this subreddit
Use private as default privacy setting|The pokémons that you deposit will automatically be set as private

Optional: there are also customization options that you might want to edit:

Option|Explanation
:---|:---
Custom theme|Change the appearance of Pokécheck. Kaphotics suggests Modern, I personally love Clean
Columns to display in Pokémon lists|Changes the information displayed in boxes

Feel free to experiment. I've settled for the following columns: 

&gt;sprite,shinyicon,gendersign,nick,nature,ability,itemicon,level,otflag,tid,sid,ivs,evs,format

**Step 3: Setting up your console**

Follow the guide on Pokécheck's main page on how to set up the custom DNS address on your console. If you encounter any issues, use the shoutbox to ask for help.

**Step 4: Your first upload**

Pick any pokémon of low value (Bidoof will do), connect to the GTS as usual in any Pokemon center, deposit the poor Bidoof by asking for any pokémon in return (any will do).

[Screenshot 1](http://i.imgur.com/Gct7rKj.png)

You should get an error/rejection message.

[Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/zMQhD2h.png)

If you did not get rejected, this means that you have not set the DNS properly or your internet provider blocks Pokécheck.

**Step 5: Claiming the Pokémon**

Click on ""Unclaimed Pokémon from my IP"". You should see your Bidoof.

[Screenshot 3](http://i.imgur.com/hIVdnbN.png)

Tick the box to its left, and associate the pokémon to your account. The pokémon is moved to your default box, or whatever box is currently active on your account. Click on ""Manage my Pokémon"", and on your Bidoof's name to view its marvelous stats.


**Step 6: Creating a new box**

Create a new box on which you will move the pokémon you want to trade. Give it a descriptive name (""totally not hacked pokémons"" will be just fine) and move the pokes you want to trade in it.

**Step 7: Showcasing your collection**

If you followed the guide this far, all of the pokémons that you have deposited are set as private. You can verify that by checking the state of the Public/Private checkboxes. There are three possible configurations:

Private|Public|Status|Effect
:--:|:--:|:---|:---
X|_|Private|The pokémon is private and no one but its owner can see/download it
_|X|Public|The pokémon is public, can be searched for in the search engine and can be downloaded by anyone
_|_|Read-only|The pokémon is read-only. Other viewers can view its page but not download it

The last configuration (unticking both Public and Private boxes) is the configuration you want to setup for the pokémons to show to other people.

**Step 8: Enabling public view**

The public view does not mean that your Pokémons are going to be public. It just allows you to link your box to someone else. Only the pokémons that are set as read-only or public will be visible on public view. Private pokémon will remain invisible. Public viewing is not available for your default box.

While in your trading box, click on ""Enable public view"".

[Screenshot 4](http://i.imgur.com/c9XcZa2.png)

A new option appears: ""Open public view"". Click on that link.

[Screenshot 5](http://i.imgur.com/b6w70YB.png)

The link to this page is the one you want to give out publicly. It has the following format:

&gt;https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=number&amp;u=nickname

The following link:

&gt;https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=user

is NOT a link to your trading box or to any of your boxes. If you ended up with this link, you did something wrong!

You're now ready to trade. Do not forget to review the rules of the subreddit before posting.

*****

**Addendum: the case of ribonned events**

Some pokémons come with a special ribbon that forbids them from being traded on the GTS. As a consequence, they cannot be checked on Pokécheck. Ironically, those are the pokémons that are the most in need of being checked.

If you want to check one of them, there are a few options:

* If you play on a emulator or a flashcard, all you have to do is to open your save with Pokegen to extract the pkm file of your pokemons.
* If you play on a retail game, you will have to use specialized hardware or a slot-1 flashcard to extract the save, or trade with another game running on a flashcard (requires another DS and a slot-1 flashcard), or trade with a Wifi-enabled emulator. That done, extract the pkm files from the save.

Once you have the pkm files, you can manually upload them on Pokécheck.

* If you are unable to do the above, you will have to request an event check on this subreddit, or wait for an event checker to create a thread dedicated to just that.

*****

**Addendum: the profanity filter**

Pokémons that have names/nicknames that may be offensive to children cannot be uploaded to the GTS, and thus, checked on Pokécheck. However Game Freak did not bother to exclude the official names and as a result, Cofagrigus, Froslass, Nosepass and Probopass cannot be traded out of the box on the GTS. You will need to nickname them before offering them for trade, or ask an event checker for a check.

*****

**Addendum: Pokémons deposited but not claimed**

You have 24 hours to claim a pokémon. If you deposited one but did not claim it during the 24-hour delay, the pokémon will go into a limbo in which it cannot be downloaded, viewed, or deleted. If you check this pokémon again, the legality analysis will mark it as a clone, because the pokémon is already in the database. If you are the original trainer of the pokémon, you can still claim it by registering your save file (see Pokécheck's main page for explanations). If you are not the OT, there is nothing you can do about it.",,False,,t5_2rmov,1375735592.0,,,True,t3_1jg6mx,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jg6mx/announcement_how_to_use_pokécheck_a_quick_guide/,

We were informed a while back that someone traded a non-shiny Groudon to this user and a couple days later, it turned up shiny in a different thread, clearly hacked, having the same info down to the last IV, just shiny. It was put up for offer for trading and almost was traded to an unsuspecting user. 

**People caught hacking do not get away with it.**

There is a lot of suspicion surrounding his other shinies, they were very likely hacked like the Groudon was, including a certain Charizard which I deem very suspicious. If you were involved with some trades, let us know what they were.

**Friend Code - 4342-2825-5366**

When trading, it's a standard, be careful when trading. If someone seems suspicious, it's better off not to trade. Always double check the origins of pokemon. If some pokemon seem a bit odd to you, you can always click the OT to see other pokemon belonging to that OT to check if anything else is a bit odd (not applicable to pre-set OT events unfortunately like Movie14 or 10 ANIV) 

Side note - Pokechecks are REQUIRED for trading here. I know there's some hassle regarding event pokemon, but it's being worked on. Anyone who has submitted, is being/has been considered. For new users, anyone with a Master Ball in their flair is an approved event checker.

1364270325.0,27,self.pokemontrades,1b0t59,[Announcement] Tutorial on how to pokecheck events using a flashcart.,30,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1b0t59/announcement_tutorial_on_how_to_pokecheck_events/,"This is a tutorial on how to pokecheck event pokemon (ribboned pokemon) if you have a flashcart. I know this might not apply to most of you but I hope I can help someone who wants to know.

**Requirements**

* Flashcart

* ROM of Pokemon Black or White

* Pokesav BW version or Pokegen

(I will not post a download link for pokesav because I dont want to get in any trouble, but it should be fairly easy to find by just googling it)


**Try this with a normal pokemon (i.e. Bidoof) first to prevent any mistakes from ruining your event pokemon.**

******

**Steps using Pokesav**

1. Make sure that you have got to the part where you can trade in your ROM, you will have to trade in the union room since most flashcarts dont have infrared capabilities.

2. Trade the pokemon you want to check over to your game in your flashcart.

3. Save your flashcart game and turn it off.

4. Connect your flashcart to your computer.

5. Open your flashkart folder and search for the .sav file of your Pokemon BW ROM.

6. Copy it to your desktop. At this moment you can safely extract your flashkart and trade back your pokemon.

7. Open Pokesav and open your .sav file of your ROM using Pokesav

8. You will see all the data of your game, it is important **not** to change anything since it could affect your game.

9. Go to the Party Section and you will see an outline of the pokemon in your party. Save the file of the pokemon you want to check.

* You can also go to 'Storage' and search through your boxes if your pokemon is in any of your boxes

10 . Finally upload them to pokecheck using the 'Choose File' section where you will pick the file of the pokemon and 'Import 5 Gen .pkmn file' option at the bottom of the page.

*******

**NOTE:** This is only the way to do it using Pokesav. I dont have any experience on using Pokegen so if someone knows how to please let me know and I will add it to the instructions.

Also, if you have any points on how to improve this please let me know :).

A few things regarding the current status of /r/PokemonTrades:

* This is a hard time of the year, everyone has been busy with the holidays, finals, family, traveling, and working to recover from the holiday spending.  

* We can't just assign new mods on the spot, I have been actively reaching out to the other existing mods to see if they would like to participate still.  If we feel that we need new mods I will be selecting who I see fit as a moderator. (Things are look for are users who have tenure and conduct business with respect and help the community).  

* We need your help: This is a community, not a dictatorship. I don't want mods to be running this community and nit-picking at everything going wrong.  If you know how this sub runs, please help a new user out.

* **PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF SWEET BABY ARCEUS BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR TRADES.** Do some research on the user to see if they are new or an active member.  If it is an event Pokemon you are trading for, please do a quick search to make sure the pokecheck is correct.  Look for things like the OT, met date, met location, the pokeball it is in, move set, and level if it is untrained...

* Please be patient with these upcoming changes.

* Any comments or concerns regarding the community should be handled through the mods first, try not to make any posts ranting about issues. It brings down the moral of everyone. Then everyone needs to get their torches and pitchforks and head somewhere, and usually that's to me. And it's not fun dealing with an angry mob.

* Also, any suggestions for events I can host for you guys please let me know, I know the last mystery egg swap was somewhat half-assed, but it was finals time and the holidays.  I will be hosting more once my personal matters settle down.

My username may not show it, but I have a long tenure with this community, I had to change my username for personal reasons(fuck it, this is enzo, some of you may remember me).  I truly care about this community and I always want the best for it.  I am trying to do everything in my power to get everything going here.  I want to be honest and open with you guys too.  I do not participate in this community as much mainly because I am tied up with personal matters, work, and running /r/PokemonLeagueDS.

1375960237.0,26,self.pokemontrades,1jy6ea,[Mod Post] Anti-scamming measures.,33,7,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jy6ea/mod_post_antiscamming_measures/,"You all know we have trouble with hackers, and rest assured, we DO look into them. HOWEVER, you guys play a major role in helping us, we are powerless to ban anyone without sufficient proof. ''a ban that didn't take MONTHS to go through!'' is an example of this. We are very much a user-run subreddit, and the mods either make changes to this place, or ban people who disturb it. Here's how YOU guys can push a ban to be handed out quicker and avoid being scammed.

------------------------

**One** - **No. Jumping. The gun.** I know everyone wants to be the one that points out someone is hacking but the moment you do that they delete the evidence. All of it. All we have is your word and while we trust it, we can't bank on someone's word. It COULD be wrong, a misunderstanding. If you see someone hacking, don't call them out on it immediately. 

Take screenshots, message anyone involved in the trade **privately** and message us. THIS is the best way to report someone. And please, **never** message 1 of us. It WILL be answered quicker through ''message the mods'' since it sends it at once through mod mail.

**Two** - Pokecheck box. Now, personally, this should be the most common practice. It stops people stealing boxes. Instead of linking a check like [this example](https://www.pokecheck.org/?pk=5553656) you should link it [like this example](https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=2&amp;u=keichy) so that way, nobody can steal your Pokemon and claim it as their own.

**Three** Check the users account. Account age, activity, have they ever been here before etc. Walking into a trade with events and shinies with a guy barely here a day is a bad idea. 

**Four** Check serebii, bulbapedia and Pokecheck for answers. DO NOT confuse legality with legitimacy, if something is all green, it does not mean it is legitimate, but a well trained eye could spot any sign of hacking if there.

**Five** SCREENSHOTS. Again with the screenshots, but when downloading events through wi-fi or through in-life events, try take a picture of you downloading them, not after you've download them. This helps a lot with toning down suspicion. Also, include your username.

**Six** If someone has given you a hard time in a trade or anything of the sort, don't be afraid to leave a BAD reference. The references subreddit is not a place of praise, it's a reference for a reason, bad references are also encouraged, the worst thing is painting a picture of someone who they aren't.


**Seven** Avoid trading in PM's like the plague. We cannot help you spot a hack if nobody is there to see it. They are extremely suspicious trades, so I've declined almost all trades through PM unless I trusted the user and was getting a direct trade, like their own RNG's.


**Eight** ASK QUESTIONS AND ASK FOR PROOF - If something seems shady in a trade, especially with a new user, ask them about it. Don't press them too hard, but make them come up with some kind of a story. Usually its really easy to spot the shady ones. e.g. ""I got it from a friend at school he says its legit""


**Nine** Don't be afraid to get a second opinion before trading. We have a handy flair system now. Find a mod, or a user with a high flair level to help you out and give you their opinion before agreeing to a potentially risky trade. Lots of people will be happy to help you out.

**Ten** Collect all the info you can. Friend Codes, Pokecheck Usernames, and OT ID/SID are crucial.

**Eleven** REPORT REPORT REPORT Use that little report button to silently draw our attention to shady threads and posts.


That's some of my anti-scamming advice, and please, be careful when trading. This is meant to be fun, and we don't need more people get scammed. ",,False,,t5_2rmov,1375961823.0,,gsball,True,t3_1jy6ea,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jy6ea/mod_post_antiscamming_measures/,moderator

Please do NOT upvote comments or reply ''agreed'' to comments with nominees. It's harder to see. For future reference, comment so it's easier to tally!**

This subreddit, while small, is pretty busy. We have plenty of regular users, lurkers and occasional traders who just want their Charmander to start their Black 2 adventure. We have all sorts of users.

Nonetheless, it's busy, and we occasionally miss things or maybe we all just get busy and it causes things to pile up, leaving a cluster of things to deal with later on.

Anyway, we've decided a user-voted moderator is most beneficial to the subreddit, so please feel free to either **comment your suggestion** or **private message your application to be a moderater by clicking on 'message the moderators''**. However, with a position being a moderator, the rules are quite strict so read carefully;

-------------------------------

**Required**

* Be active/known. Someone who traded/trades regularly with a good name and respected. 

* Be willing to dedicate time. Some people view being a mod as nothing more than novelty, and abandon their mod status and become inactive. This is seen reddit-wide. Please note there's a lot of things to deal with being a moderator, this includes; 

-Reviewing event check applications (if available) I'm currently the only one reviewing these since I just have more time available, and they take a hell of a long time.

-Checking and looking into any scammer or hacker reports. All mods do this but like mentioned, we get busy and sometimes things just slip between the cracks.

-Automod slacks off sometimes and the spam filter will still flag something that has been automod-approved, meaning some posts need to be re-approved because that damn spam filter acts up.

-Misc. jobs, such as helping new users and pointing them in the right direction, removing spam posts (like ''[Question] what's pokecheck'') and explaining there's something in the sidebar on it/linking them the guide. We try keep easily answered questions off the front page to make room for actual trades. 

* No shady history. Self-explanatory, shady trades that didn't end well because the Pokemon in question had odd origins with little to no explanation how you got them. (though these people don't stick around too long anyway...)

----------------------

**Optional**  

* Different timezones. Current timezones the current mods have listed are GMT, CST and EST. The mods have noticed that sometimes we are relatively on around the same time (but I blame my late-night internet surfing habits on that one)

* Ability to check events.

It's become a serious issue on this subreddit. Half of the threads posted here offering shiny or event pokemon offer up no pokechecks or back out as soon as they are requested. I wanted to bring this to light and also point out how to tell a fake from a genuine pokemon. 

[
This pokemon has been downloaded and re uploaded to pokecheck. As an event pokemon, chances are it's a clone if you get offered one.](https://www.pokecheck.org/?screenshot=2045841&amp;la) 

And while I can't find a great example of this right now, the more red and yellow you see, the better the chances you have of receiving a hacked/downloaded pokemon. However RNG abused pokemon are still legitamate. (look in the IV section of the legal check)

Pokemon uploaded by default are set to private. If someone links you a pokemon that you can find in pokecheck search results, ask them to take it off public. This is easy to do if they own the account tied to the pokemon. 

searching for a pokemon is easy. Just pick out the trainer ID in the image and search using pokecheck.org search utility. 

**Common Excuses:**

&gt; ""I can't pokecheck.""

If you can connect to trade, you can pokecheck. Changing the DNS settings is easy and undoable after it's pokechecked. 

&gt; ""My pokemon can't be checked, it has a ribbon""

I'd personally steer clear of any ""ribbon"" pokemon. The pokecheck website attaches a premiere ribbon to the pokemon so it can't be traded on the GTS or passed of as legit. There's a chance they've just downloaded that pokemon from pokecheck.
That said, keep this in mind: event mew and mewtwo have premiere ribbons. Good chance those are legit.  The other ribbon that prevents upload to pokecheck is the classic ribbon. If you want a pokemon from an event. look it up first. 

[Take a look here to see if the pokemon you want should or shouldn't have a ribbon.](http://projectpokemon.org/events/en-V.php)

&gt; Just plain backing out or refusal to pokecheck

Just avoid. 

**When you pokecheck:**

* Make your account and ""claim"" the pokemon you've just uploaded. 
* at the very bottom there's a legality analysis button. Click that
* at the bottom of THAT window you can ""download the screen shot""
* copy paste that analysis in your trade.
* Be sure your pokemon is set to PRIVATE. Otherwise people can just search for your pokemon and download it without trading. Which I assume you don't want. 

**Other things you can do:**

Look at the users /r/pokemontrade comments, do they come through on trades often? Are they comfortable posting pokechecks in other threads? Be your own detective.
And if you get scammed with a hacked pokemon, post proof in a message to the mods. 

------------------------------

Having grown up with pokemon since red and blue I hold a uniquely caught and bred pokemon in a higher esteem than a cloned one. I hope this PSA helps others figure out if they're getting a legitimate Pokemon in future trades.

As part of my thanks to him for helping me fill out my Unova Pokedex, I'd like to practice a little pay it forward mentality and will gladly breed you whatever 1st, 3rd, 5th generation starter, or Zorua you want.  Want to get the whole set?  No problem!  Just let me know ahead of when you're ready to trade so that I can get the breeding done.  Also, please note that I am NOT just breeding a limited amount.  This is by request.



If you really want to be awesome, I'm looking for Generation 2 and Generation 4 starters, any legendary Pokemon you'd be willing to part with, a damn Gible, a Bagon, the fossil turtle thing from Generation 5, Black version exclusives, or any other rare Pokemon from past generations.


Now, I know what you're thinking right now: ""But mahelke, I don't have any of those!  How can I get my hands on a brand new trio of starters?""  No problem!  If you don't have any of the Pokemon I'm looking for, just send me over some things you don't need.  Yes, I won't mind getting Patrats and Lillipups, but it'd be nice to get something a little better, depending on what you can offer.



I'll be able to trade all weekend.  Drop an orangered or a PM letting me know when you can trade and what you want to trade for and we'll do this thing.

**P.S.:**  If you're looking for a starter with a specific nature or that is bred with another specific Pokemon for some reason, I'm afraid I can't help you there.  I know little to nothing about that kind of stuff and won't be able to help you there.  All starters will be bred with Ditto for the sake of brevity.


Also, my Treeckos for some reason are all hatching with Solar Beam as one of the moves, so I hope you're cool with that.




**IMPORTANT EDIT:**  Two things:

1) When you make your request, PLEASE let me know if you've completed the story or not.  This way, I'll know whether to just send you the eggs or hatch you the Pokemon.


2) Make sure you've got your connection settings right.  If you have any firewalls up or anything like that, please make sure they aren't blocking your DS's access to Nintendo WFC.  I've been having problems trading with people all day because of this, and I've already tweaked my connection settings for this.


**EDIT 2:  Unfortunately, all trades are going to have to be put on hold.  I've got all of your requested Pokemon bred and ready to go, but out of ten or eleven trades I tried to do today, I was only able to complete two of them successfully.

Due to the recent drama/scamming/OopsFests I'm going to remind the newer traders (and some older traders if they've forgotten) of some helpful tips when trading within this community and protecting your investments.

FIRST (this has been beaten to death, but it's always important) ALWAYS ask for a pokecheck when trading legendaries, events, or shinies. You should also be ready to post yours when asked. Got an event? There are plenty of people here who can check them for you. 

Secondly, do some research if what you're trading is valuable. SteveThePokedestroyer is offering a darkrai for your genesect? Check his past posts quickly. We as a community tend to remember the ones who have been shitty. Also if it's a brand new account be wary as well, it may be fine but take precautions. 

Thirdly, and I think this is exceptionally important and not followed often: KEEP BIG TRADES PUBLIC. This has many advantages, most notably, you have more eyes. Many of us will call out a fake or clone if we see it. If SteveThePokedestroyer has a cloned poke we'll say so. If it's all pm's we can't help as a community. If someone is trading the same poke to different people we're much more likely to notice if there are similar threads popping up. Hell, I had no idea that wondercards could be easily hacked until someone pointed one out. 

Finally if you do get scammed please be tactful. Message the person message the mods first. There have been cases of people unknowingly having hacked or cloned pokes. So just be careful before sharpening your pitchfork. 

Cheers, 
Minister_of_truth

Prizes will consist of shiny pokemon (here is the prize pool): http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=2&amp;u=kryzen13.

First place will also walk away with all of the following shinies, guaranteed: http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=3&amp;u=kryzen13

1373735485.0,24,self.pokemontrades,1i84ma,[PSA] Legality Analyses,31,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1i84ma/psa_legality_analyses/,"In case you guys haven't known, Pokecheck's legality analyses have never been 100% accurate. Recently, that fact has become painfully clear. 

Some people - not a large number, but enough to cause plenty of problems - have begun to take advantage of this fact. They've begun to hack Pokemon in such a way that that don't show up as hacked on Pokecheck. Meaning that some people can make just about any Pokemon appear ""real"" to the untrained eye. 

Now, your random Magikarps and Bidoofs are safe, as well as any ""generic"" Pokemon, so your Dex-filling will be fine. No one wants to hack as run-of-the-mill Poke. But this means that any events you need and/or want are potentially cloned, hacked or both. 

Some things to keep in mind when looking at legality analyses:

* Look at the location where the Pokemon was met

* Look at the level when it was caught

* Look up the Original Trainer and their Trainer ID and Secret ID. If a person hacks one Pokemon, they'll probably hack more  

* Look at the moves the Pokemon knows

* Cross-reference any event you trade for on something like Bulbapedia, Serebii, etc.. Make sure the OT is the same, the moves and level are correct, and so on. 

And possibly the most important advice I can give: 

*Look up the history of whomever you may be trading with.* Someone could have had problems trading with that person and never reported them, someone could have gotten scammed by that person and not known it, and just about anything else you can think of. I'm not blaming the victim here, but it takes two people for someone to get scammed.

He's going to absolutely love the little guy. Thanks to Davidkiin!***

**If you have a shiny Dratini I would still love to trade for him but this Charmander alone will make an amazing gift**

So my older brother's birthday was a bit ago and I haven't had a chance to see him until now. He originally introduced me to Pokemon back in the R/B/Y era and I have been hooked since. I had originally planned to use the Masuda Method to breed him one of these Pokemon as a gift for his birthday and a thank you as well. However I have been breeding for weeks and nothing. I have been too busy to really focus and breed a shit-ton of them to get one. So I come humbly to you [/r/pokemontrades](/r/pokemontrades) in the hopes that one of you would be so kind as to trade me one for the measly scraps that I offer. 

I don't have much in the way of legendary's or any shinies. I do however have:

- An entire National Dex of breed-able Pokemon of which you can have any number of them.

- The Bird Trio, Moltres, Zapdos, Articuno.

~~- The Tower Duo, Ho-Oh, Lugia.~~

- The Beast Trio, Suicune, Entei, Raicune. 

- The Regi Trio, Regice, Registeel, Regirock.

- The Creation Trio, Palkia, ~~Dialga,~~ Giratina.

- Wifi Event ~~Mewtwo,~~ Victini, Reshiram

- DW Arceus

**Take any number of Pokemon that you would like.**

**Legit only please, I would ask that you post a Poke-check but since even I can't figure that shit out I can't expect you to do so for me.**

As many of you have seen, we have a new flair system in place. This flair system is similar to the one in /r/gameswap, as in the more trades you get the higher tier Pokeball you get. There is one thing I would like to stress, when you apply for the Pokeballs you must link your own trades as we cannot go through and count every single trade you have ever done.  You should link your /r/poketradereferences page, there is an example below. **Please make sure you post your trades inside your reference thread!**  With that said, here are how many trades you need to get a Pokeball, as well as the different tiers of Pokeballs:

Tier 1 Pokeballs (Every Pokemon trade counts)

* Pokeball: 5 successful trades

* Premier Ball: 10 successful trades

Tier 2 Pokeballs (You must deal with shinies/events/valuables)

* Great Ball: 20 successful trades

* Ultra Ball: 30 successful trades

Tier 3 Pokeballs

* GS Ball: 50+ successful trades
The GS Ball is special, as it is the counterpart to the masterball flair. It will be granted to people who are trusted in the community, have cleared 50+ trades and have **NO** sketchy history whatsoever. So to apply for the GS Ball, you need a good history and proper behavior as well as 50+ successful trades under your belt.

I would like to remind everyone that **YOU** must link your references pages as well as the trade numbers that you have done and the links. If you do 5 trades in 1 thread, that still counts as 5 trades. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/poketradereferences/comments/1j2nt8/pkmn_trades_examples_reference/) is an example of a proper references page.

Any questions? Unclear points? Feel free to ask!

Common Q&amp;A:

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: I have a lot of people I have traded with and asked for a reference but they have either not left one, or did not specify what we traded for. How can I get these to count as well? Will a link verification suffice?

* A: Try to get a link and add to your reference page. The person does not have to post to your reference page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: I'm hearing a lot about multiple trades in one session. So I traded 30-40 Pokemon with &lt;insertusername&gt;. How do I document this properly for credit? Do I need to name all 40 Pokemon that were traded?

* A: A link to the thread with the number of trades is what is required. You don't need to include an entire list of all the pokemon traded. (Unless Shiny/Event/Legendary i believe?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: Is it possible to have multiple Pokeballs in Flair indicating the highest level achieved per tier? Or will it just be 1 ball for the highest level?

* A: No, the CSS doesn't support that

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: Do trades through /r/pokemongiveaways count as well? Can't give something for nothing after all, these are technically trades...

* A: No, only trades on /r/pokemontrades

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: Do tradebacks count?

* A: No, they do not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: Do trades made before this post count?

* A: Yes, so long as they follow the format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q: When will I know when I have my Flair?

* A: Well...perhaps when you see that sweet little pokeball in your flair, then you've got it!

People do know event checkers carry worthwhile stuff when checking events, so they will probably just try to scam you by downloading obvious clones and getting your legitimate stuff and take off. 

If people seem pushy to get events or shinies instead of common breedables from you when checking their events, they probably intended to rip you off. They have no reason not to believe you aren't trustworthy, nobody gets that flair easily.

Just convenience due many mobile users not having access to our rules]*

**Rule 1** - No giveaways. If you want to give something away, or want something but have nothing to trade, go to /r/pokemongiveaway. For contests, go to /r/pokemoncontests.

------------------

**Rule 2** - No hacks, clones, illegal or otherwise scamming for Pokémon. 

* Hacked Pokémon - a Pokémon obtained through external uses, via Action Replay, Gameshark, Pokegen or other similar program. Any pokemon that does not originate from the original, intended source.  For events, this includes the timeframe it was intended to be available. This includes anything and everything generated by action replay, pokemon generating websites and apps, pokemon edited by 3rd party software, and illegal wondercards. Abusing saves to re-use wondercards is illegal (be it on a rom or retail).

* Cloned Pokémon - a Pokémon with multiple copies of itself, usually obtained through PokeGTS or downloaded through Pokécheck.

* Illegal Pokémon - a Pokémon obtained through glitching the game, ie, a Flareon with Flare Blitz or a Pearl Oak's Letter Shaymin. 

* Scamming for Pokémon - trading any of the above for a legitimate Pokémon, or ripping people off similarly. 

-------------

**Rule 3** - Do proper post formats. 

* [4th] for gen 4 games. *Pearl, Diamond, Platinum, Soul Silver, Heart Gold*

* [5th] for gen 5 games. *Black, White, Black 2, White 2*

* [6th] for gen 6 games. *X, Y*

* [Question] If you have a question, keep it relevant, read the rules before consulting the subreddit and check google. 

* [Announcement] When you have something to announce, ie, ''doing event checks''

* LF - Looking For

* FT - For Trade

--------------------

**Rule 4** - Do a Pokécheck analysis on every event, legendary or shiny Pokemon. Guides below.

We have been having a lot of issues lately with scamming and hacking.  The mods have had an extremely heavy load with this huge wave of people scamming around here.  We wanted to be transparent about this and bring it to the community's attention.  We are not completely sure what to do while we figure out how to handle all of these issues and we would appreciate any feedback you can give us.  Please post in this thread with ideas on how to cutback on the scamming that has been going on in our fine sub.

----

In the mean time, here are somethings we need YOU to do:

* RESEARCH YOUR TRADE- please please PLEASE research what you are trading for and who you are trading with

* Do some slight research on who you are trading with, if they are new and offering a bunch of events and shiny Pokemon then that should raise a red flag

* For event Pokemon you should cross reference [Serebii's Event Database](http://www.serebii.net/events/), it will give you every little detail on every event Pokemon worldwide

* Check shiny and legendary Pokemon you trade for, make sure they were met in the right game, at the right level, etc

* If you see suspicious activity, report it to the mods in a **mod message**, we have a list of people to keep an eye on

I've noticed a bit of an increase in troll accounts and all-around assholes just trying to get a rise out of people because that's how they get their kicks in life. Do not respond to these people and don't comment on their threads. That's what they want. Trolls do crave attention, but the attention they hate the most is having everyone hear them while having everyone ignore them. 

This is a great subreddit and has been mostly self-governing ever since us new mods stepped in (including me with my warpath about FCs and Pokechecks). One of the good things about this community is that it's not too big like /r/pokemon, so the people that frequent here are good at keeping the content quality. As long as we ignore the Bidoofs in life, we can all trade in a much more peaceful manner.

For those who are new, an egg extravaganza is where everyone breeds a metric crapload of eggs. You then trade off your eggs for somebody elses eggs. Then, you hatch them and see what you get.

You could get Bidoofs, you could get Axews, you could get Mankeys or Gibles. It could be anything.

A couple of things rules to note:

* Feel free to trade (Saturday), tomorrow (Sunday) and for certain (awesome) people, Monday.
* Please don't try to pull a fast one and hand out eggs with legendaries in them. We're not morons. You will get a warning (which is quite visible).
* Try and trade something cool, and maybe you'll get something cool in return.
* Giveaways are welcome of course, you don't have to accept anything in return if you don't want to.

A couple of things to note when you receive an egg:

* If it's something incredible common and quite boring, check it's IV's using pokecheck or the dude in the subway tunnel, it could be a beast awaiting training. Also check the moves, as it could have DW moves or egg moves.
* Don't tell anyone what you received. Keep it a surprise until the day after, I'll post a ""wrap up"" thread so you can talk about what you got.
* Note the side bar, your probabbly going to get a crap load of eggs, so remember, Flame Body and Magma Armor abilities halve hatch times.

**How To**

There's two ways to join in.

a) You can ""broadcast"". Basically, you make a post in this thread with the following information:

    Time(s) Available: 
     XX:XX PM/AM - XX:XX PM/AM {TIMEZONE} {DATE} (XX hours from this post) 

    Number of Eggs available: XX 

    Current Amount of Eggs: XX

Simply copy and paste the above template into your post replacing all the X's and {TIMEZONE} with just your info. **MAKE SURE YOU FILL OUT THE ""HOURS FROM THIS POST""** section. It makes it amazingly easy to figure out what time your available if the person is in a different time zone than you.

Multiple ""available"" times are perfectly acceptable, and multiple egg types are cool too. Adjust the template as needed.

As you make trades, decrement the ""Current amount of eggs"" by editing your post, leave the total number of eggs as a history. If you have multiple egg types, feel free to make a bunch of options for a person to accept (say, pick a number between 1 and 3, then give them the corresponding egg)

When your time comes up, start your DS up and wait just outside the wifi room, when someone reply's to your broadcast, enter their friend code, make the trade, and reply to their post so you know it's complete. If you got multiple people waiting, tell them to hold on while you get the person ahead of you.

b) You can trade without a ""broadcast""

To do this, find someone elses broadcast and reply to their main post (essentially make a new comment thread) saying something along the lines of ""hey, I'll trade with you"". Be sure to enter their friend code before you make the post, that way you can make the trade as fast as possible. Trade one of your eggs for one of theirs.

**Important:**

It's a statutory holiday for us master race Canadians on Monday. So feel free to trade on those days too.

1376747432.0,20,self.pokemontrades,1kjrx5,[Mod Post] Please make sure you're reading the rules!,21,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1kjrx5/mod_post_please_make_sure_youre_reading_the_rules/,"Hey all, its cryo with a friendly PSA.

As our time in 5th gen nears a close and hype for gen 6 is at its peak, we've seen a pretty big influx of new or casual users to the sub.  Recently, I've been noticing a larger-than-average number of rule-breaking threads popping up, in spite of changes to the sub design made primarily to put important information in a more visible and accessible layout.

If you haven't done so yet, or even if you're a long time user who hasn't looked for a while, make sure you're [familiar with all of our rules.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jnjd2/mod_post_convenience_rules_link_for_mobile_users/)  They're all there for a reason, mostly to keep actual trading threads from disappearing among a sea of off-topic questions, ditto requests, beggars, and value/legality posts.

Also recently, I've noticed that lots of people, even some veteran users, are responding and going along with threads that are against the rules.  All this does is teach these users that breaking the rules is fine, and they don't need to be bothered reading them.  I know most of you are just trying to help, but if you want to do that, just take it to PMs.  Please, if you see a post that is breaking one of the sub rules, the correct course of action would be to report it and make a simple post reminding them they're breaking the rules, and one of the mods will find it ASAP and take care of it.  Don't bother reporting threads by messaging us though unless its something really serious.  With flair requests coming in, that would just cause more chaos than good.

Anyways, for those of you who didn't jump over to the rules page via the hyperlink above (yeah, I called you on it), here's what the main offenders have been lately:

1.  **DON'T ASK FOR DITTOS READ THE SIDEBAR**
2.  Don't ask questions that aren't directly related to the trading of pokemon.  There are bunches of other pokemon related subs that can help.  Have a question about RNG or competitive battling?  There are subs for that, and there's a list of a bunch toward the bottom of the sidebar.  Question about pokecheck?  Go to pokecheck, or read the guide in the sidebar.
3.  Don't ask questions that are already clearly answered in the guides posted in the sidebar.  **READ THEM FIRST**.
4.  **DON'T ASK FOR DITTOS READ THE SIDEBAR**
5.  Don't ask what something is worth.  Again, read the first guide in the sidebar.  Aside from that, use common sense.  Everything is worth something similar in rarity.  Pretty straightforward.
6.  Don't ask if every single one of your pokemon is legit.  If you don't know where it came from, you can never really know if its legit.  If its all green on pokecheck, its *likely* (but not guaranteed to be) legal.  Asking for help on pokecheck about questionable things is generally the best way to go.  Other than that, try to find a trusted user or a mod to help you out.  If you have questions about something that looks suspicious though, **DON'T TRADE IT**.  Common sense.  
7.  **DON'T ASK FOR DITTOS READ THE SIDEBAR**
8.  Don't ask for handouts, or give them away.  If someone is asking for something with little in return, point them to /r/pokemongiveaway.  Don't encourage them by granting their requests here!

And not necessarily a solid rule, but a good guideline to follow:

* Be specific.  Don't post threads like ""LF: Offers FT: Ask""  Come prepared with pokechecks, and lists of things you want and can offer.  Obviously there can be other negotiations, but have something specific in mind.  If you're just looking for what's out there, check out everyone else's threads first.

On the whole, you all do a great job of staying on-topic and helping each other out, so keep that up!

1375652823.0,19,self.pokemontrades,1jp9rf,[Feedback] Changes to the sub and flair system.,20,1,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jp9rf/feedback_changes_to_the_sub_and_flair_system/,"So as I'm pretty sure you've all noticed, a lot has changed in the sub over the past 24 hours.  In what was kind of a spur of the moment thing in chatting yesterday, we started talking about possibly changing around how a lot of stuff looked (even though we're all pretty clueless about CSS).  What you see is the result.

We are using a brand new CSS template for the entire sub, giving it a slightly sleeker feel.  The sidebar was completely re-done to get rid of some clutter and make sure that the most important information was easily and immediately viewable in an attempt to cut down on questions being asked that are already answered in the sidebar.

With that said, the changes are far from done.  As cursedbanana and I figure out more of the CSS, we plan on making things look even sleeker and awesome.  For now though, we welcome any input you may have on the design, or suggestions you might have to improve it.

Now, for the Flair changes.  After discussion, several of the mods felt that with the addition of the new flair system, the Master Ball didn't make as much sense to be used for event checkers, and was more naturally the choice to give to the most trusted traders.  For this reason, we decided to switch the event check flair over to the Cherish Ball (since, you know, all events come in them nowadays).  We understand this might cause some confusion initially, but with the new chart in the sidebar, hopefully confusion is minimal.

The Pokeball flair has also been changed to be achievable at 5 successful trades, and a premier ball at 10 trades.  This was done both to allow the pokeball to best function as the ""basic level"" flair, and to make at least 10 high-value trades necessary to achieve a great ball instead of only 5, making it a more impressive jump to match the importance of changing from basic trades to shinies and events.

However, your input is always important, and the flair exists for your benefit, so if you as a community want the flair switched back to how it was, or have other suggestions of what they should be, please let us know here.

*edit: Oh, and as changes will still be coming as we finalize and tweak things in the coming weeks.  So if you happen to come on and something is broken or looks weird, it probably just means one of us is testing stuff out.

1372489072.0,19,self.pokemontrades,1hatf9,[Announcement] How everyone (with a wired [Ethernet] connection can do Pokéchecks themselves,20,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1hatf9/announcement_how_everyone_with_a_wired_ethernet/,"I found this sub about a month ago and the main problem (other than those pesky hackers, scammers and all-round arseholes) seemed to be that many couldn't easily get pokechecks, so here's some help.

Download [this](http://ubuntuone.com/4PJs98KD227M0fJO6sYzi5) first and extract the files.

~~-----~~

Instructions:

1. Install WinPCap using the exe. (If it says 'This program has compatability issues' then just press 'run the program...')

2. Open the correct version of DeSmuME (32- or 64-bit, as necessary) and go to *config &gt; wifi settings*. Make sure *Infrastructure* is selected and make sure the 'Bridge Network Adapter' is your Ethernet card (for those who don't what this should be, it'll probably be the long and complicated name, mine happens to be *Intel(R) 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection* (Just as an example).

3. Open *config &gt; emulation settings* and check *Use external BIOS images*, then for the ARM9 image, select your *biosnds9.bin* from the download folder, and for the ARM7 image, select your *biosnds7.bin*.

4. In the same window check *Use external firmware image* and use the *firmware.bin* from the download folder. Then check *Boot form firmware (like the NDS)*.

5. Find a suitable rom, copy to *Roms* folder, and in the Rom's Wi-Fi settings, select *Search for an access point* which should give *SoftAP* as the only option. Select this and then continue.

6. Play through the game a bit so WiFi functionality is available (e.g. Defeat Cheren in B2W2), catch a pokemon to trade, and do the normal trade through the WiFi room (making sure to register the FCs first :P I forgot this while testing).

7. Use pokegen to open the save file (will be a .dsv file in the *Battery* folder) and extract the .pkm(s) of your Pokémon and then use them as normal with Pokécheck.

---Possible Error 20104---

To fix this, copy the *firmware.dfc* in the *Firmware*  folder into the main folder (it should replace the one automatically generated by DeSmuME), and restart DeSmuME. The console which pops up when you start DeSmuME should say *firmware save confing-done* when you start up the rom. (This fix worked for me, hopefully it will for you to)

--Note--

For those on laptops, all you need to do is turn off WiFi and use a Ethernet cable temporarily.

I have only tested this for Black 2, but I presume it will work for all Gen IV/V, but I can't guarantee it.

Edit: For anyone who tries this, if you're successful then please leave a comment, I just want to see if this works for everyone, not just for me (although I don't know why that would be)

Edit 2: Just found out that if you did have to use the firmware.dfc patch, the patch file is overwritten if you refresh (Ctrl+R) DeSmuME, so either don't, or just copy the firmware.dfc back into your main folder again after a refresh.",,False,,t5_2rmov,1372540635.0,,,True,t3_1hatf9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1hatf9/announcement_how_everyone_with_a_wired_ethernet/,

I have played pokemon since red/blue was released and played through gold. I took a break for some several years due to school and such. I started playing again in feburary. Since then i've taken a more serious approach on it and have been trying to learn the metagame and learn as much as i can about the game. I've always tried to play any game competive that i got into, I used to run a fairly sucessful raiding guild through patch 4.1 in WoW. I currently play League of Legends and some SC2.

  I want to make this subreddit better and more streamlined. I also would like to foster a community of people trying to help each other out. ((not begging)) i tend to be online quiet a bit due to the nature of  my job. so if there is ever any questions or comments feel free to PM them to me. 

   Also i will field some questions and comments here if there are any. thank you for your time and as always happy trading. 

I also will be adding a 4th gen game to my collection ""soonish"" so i can better help 4th gen players.

I'm good at getting events off the GTS, so I figure I get a Mew, have you RNG me three shinies or so, and then in a couple weeks when I need more you do the same again.

A lot of people are complaining about how Pokemon is just too cool. We full on agree. It's tiring seeing the same game released every couple of years with a brand new storyline and a handful of awesome new Pokemon. Still, the games become more and more popular, which, we agree, annoys us too.

At both r/Pokemon and r/Pokemontrades, we felt that Pokemon is just too.... popular. Everyone's heard of it, and it's driving us crazy. We can't sit in Starbucks anymore sipping our Grande no fat triple cream double Cinnamon mocha cappuccino's with a red stir stick instead of green and discuss Pokemon while listening to like Lucerin Blue (but you probably haven't heard of them, they're pretty underground) on our Mac Book's without someone knowing who they are.

So, its with our pleasure that both r/Pokemon and r/Pokemontrades have partaken in a joint operation to revitalize the whole concept of the two subreddits, which has ascended from it's mainstream roots to a more underground and ironic theme and subject.

We created..... **r/Digimon** and **r/Digimontrades**! The premier places to trade/discuss your favorite Digimon!

We really hope you guys also enjoy the artistic changes we've made to the subreddit. I'd tell you guys the names of the Digimon in the banner, but you probably haven't heard of them.",,False,,t5_2rmov,False,,,True,t3_gg2tq,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/gg2tq/announcement_adjustments_to_the_goals_and_styles/,moderator

While that's great, I don't think we should let that cause problems for anyone still working with D/P/HG/SS.

I therefore propose that we adopt a similar practice to /r/gameswap and other subreddits.  In your post, put a label, like [Gen V] or [Gen IV] to make it easier to distinguish.  Eventually (few months? year?) we can do away with that, as almost no one will be asking for gen IV trades, but until then, I think it's a good way to keep things somewhat organized.

1375910020.0,14,self.pokemontrades,1jwspa,[Mod Post] Finalized Flair Information,16,2,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jwspa/mod_post_finalized_flair_information/,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on your recent community input and mod decision, the new flair system has been officially finalized.  As you can see from the sidebar, the GS ball has been brought back by popular demand, with an awesome original ""official"" sprite courtesy of /u/nextlevelcolors.

Now, the process of obtaining the flair is still exactly the same.  The first step is creating a thread for yourself on /r/poketradereferences.  Then, whenever you complete a trade, link the thread and what you traded into your reference page ([Here is an example of a good format.](http://www.reddit.com/r/poketradereferences/comments/1j2nt8/pkmn_trades_examples_reference/))

Once that is done, click the button in the sidebar that says ""Message the Mods"" and we'll review it as soon as we can.  Please take note that the higher the ball level you are applying for, the longer the processing will take.

So now, the Balls:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tier 1 Balls** (Any Trades Count)

* Pokeball - - 5+ Trades
* Premier Ball - - 10+ Trades

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tier 2 Balls** (Only trades involving shinies/events count toward your total beyond 10 trades)

* Great Ball - - 20+ Trades
* Ultra Ball - - 30+ Trades
* Master Ball - - 50+ Trades

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Special Balls**

* G/S Ball - - These users are 100% Trusted by the Mods.  Not only have they completed many trades, they are active and helpful members of the community.  They help new users regularly and help keep the sub hack-free.  You can apply for a G/S ball, but the process will take quite some time to complete (likely 2-4 weeks), and the distribution is completely up to the mods' decision.  If you have not already been approved for a masterball, the chances of being approved for a G/S ball are slim to none.
* Cherish Ball - - These users are also 100% trusted by the mods, and have the ability to check events.  You have no worries about being scammed when getting checks done by these users.  The application process is identical to the G/S Ball app with a similar timeline.  Trade at your own risk when getting checks done by users without this flair.
* Other Balls/Flairs - - Any other ball or other flair image you see is mod-only.  Simply something used to set us apart from the sea of other balls.  Call it a job perk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, to clarify a couple issues that have been unclear.

First, if you trade with one user in a thread and each exchange 3 pokemon (or any number), that entire transaction only counts as **1 trade**, not 3.

Tier 1 trades only count up to 10, so the premier ball is as high as you can go without trading events/shinies.  Those first 10 will, however, count towards higher balls also.  This means a minimum of 10 high-valued trades (along with 10 standard) are required to reach Great Ball status, and so on.

**Giveaways, Event Checks, and Tradebacks DO NOT COUNT toward any ball.**

It is not possible to have multiple flairs.

If you've already submitted an app, please don't submit again if its been a while and you haven't got your flair.  We're working on it, and you'll be promptly notified when its updated.

Also, having a large number of other users post references isn't required for any of the standard trade flairs (poke through master), but they do certainly help us see that you're an honest trader.

Similarly, the mods reserve the right to deny *any* flair due to a shady trade history.

**!!!!!** **Important Note** - If you are *reapplying* for a higher flair, please please please make sure that your new trades are somehow separated and highlighted from the ones that have already been reviewed.  Our memories aren't that good.  If you don't do this, we'll probably just tell you to fix it anyways. **!!!!!**

I apologize for any confusion that there's been while we've been trying to get the system implemented.  Now that the levels are set, we should be able to start getting through more apps and get everyone caught up soon (I hope).

So that's it, ladies and gentlemen.  Please follow the rules, and happy trading!",,False,,t5_2rmov,1376532516.0,,cryo,True,t3_1jwspa,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1jwspa/mod_post_finalized_flair_information/,moderator

Going to try to get as many different people as possible, so I'm limiting the amount of checks to *3 per person*.

For the most part, it will simply be first come, first served.  However, if you can post and link to a trade thread where you have a trade that is pending on a check, I will give you priority.

Everyone needs to be fast and efficient so that we can get as much done as possible.  If we enter the room and there seems to be any kind of connection issues, immediately leave and come back, don't wait to send messages about it.  After we trade, stay in the room and wait for me to come back.  It will only take about 2 minutes once I leave to check them and come back.

Once you recieve a PM from me saying you're up, you need to respond with your FC and your pokecheck info. But, if you post early and fail to respond within about 5 minutes to my PM telling you I'm ready to do your check, you will be skipped over.  Again, its all about being as fast and ready as possible.

Another tip is to have the pokemon you need checked in your party so you don't have to sit and look through your boxes in the trade room.

Also, please don't ask to check more than 3.  If you have more, you can always contact me later, but if you want a bunch done, like 10+, we're going to need to plan a time, and I'll probably ask for something in return for the time commitment.

*edit: For those in different time-zones, [go here to see what time it is in EDT](http://www.thetimenow.com/edt/eastern_daylight_time).

Edit2: I forgot to mention it, but please make sure you turn voice chat off when going in to trade.  Starting checks now.

3dit: Just a heads up, I'm going to try to get through everyone who's posted so far, but I might not (sorry).  I can almost guarantee, unless you've got an immediate trade on hold, if you post after this point, I won't have time for now.

edit4: Really sorry, but I have to cut this a bit short.  Just got a phone call and I need to head out for a little bit.  Gonna try to do at least one thread per week if I can, so please keep an eye out, or feel free to message me and we'll try to work something out if I can.",,True,,t5_2rmov,1371421116.0,,cryo,True,t3_1ggquw,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1ggquw/announcement_5th_doing_event_checks_starting_430/,

I am available for the next hour to help you out with these checks but I have a couple of requests to make the process quick and easy. The quicker the process, the more checks I can do. 

1. Post here requesting an event check. I will respond to you, **and I will PM you** asking for your pokecheck account username/password (set up a temporary one... use 'porkchopsammich' if you want to make it really easy.)

2. Please only request a check once you're ready to have one done. Don't ask now and then tell me that you'll be home in 25 mins. to trade. If you request an event check, you should be waiting on me to be ready, not the other way around.

2. I will meet you in the wifi room and we can trade. I will exit and you should **STAY IN THE ROOM**. Doing the checks only takes a minute, and I don't want to waste time chasing you down to give you back your Pokemon.

3. Max of 6 checks per person. If you're farming Deoxys and want more than 6 done, then I ask that you give me one Deoxys in return (time that I spend doing checks, is time that I'm not able to farm them myself.)

I have a couple days in front of me where I have very little happening outside of work. So, why not breed?

I like to think I have gotten pretty good at breeding as a whole. I can breed for egg moves, ability, nature and IVs, and any combination of the four. So make your requests as specific as you want and I will try to make it happen.
A few notes:

- One per person. I will be doing this for the benefit of all of you, and I don't want to get stuck up on one person who wants 5 very specific breeds. If you want more than one, we can talk of an actual trade and see if it will happen
- I have work every night from 5:30-11 EST (potentially later, dependent on scheduling). I will not be able to breed much at these times. Feel free to leave requests and I will get back to you when I get home.
- Naturally, this will take some time. I will work as fast as I can to help anyone who asks, but don't be impatient. Depending on potential demand, it may take a day or two to get it to you.

The price you may ask? Nothing really. If you want to toss in something neat like a PP Up/Max/Rare Candy, I certainly wouldn't complain, but I will do it for free.
My FC is 4127-0083-9761.

**EDIT:** I **do not** RNG abuse. I can do some regular breeding and see what comes up, but I highly doubt I can get you perfect IVS across the board, the perfect nature and the perfect ability at the same time. 

**EDIT 2:** Thought it might be nice to leave an up to date queue up here so you can see potential wait.

~~Hello ladies and gentlemen of /r/pokemontrades!! It is my great pleasure to bring to you 30 Wishmaker Jirachi this holiday season. I've had kind of a crappy year but still want to try and end it on a high note as best I can. One of the ways I thought I could achieve this was by showing my appreciation to one of my most frequented subreddits!! You guys have helped me complete pokedexes, given me legendaries and shinies, and have at the very least tripled the amount of DW pokemon in my possession. So for the past two weeks I've been playing my copy of Sapphire, downloading a Jirachi from my Wishmaker Bonus Disc, trading it over to my copy of Leaf Green and then doing the whole process all over again until I had an entire box full for you guys. With that said, we can now proceed to the details.~~

~~Currently all the Jirachi are on my copy of Diamond (4th Gen). None of them have been transferred up to my copy of White (5th Gen), yet. I want to give the folks with only 4th Gen games an equal chance at one and want an idea of how many I will need to transfer up before actually having to do so.~~ 

~~If you would like one, please [go here to see the box full of Jirachi](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=6&amp;u=monutz). Pick one out and then reply to this post. In your post reply please let me know which Generation you want the Jirachi on and let me know which item the Jirachi you would like is holding (**ex. May I have the Jirachi holding the Lum Berry for my 5th Gen?**). They will be given out on a first come, first serve basis. Also, in order to give as many people as possible a chance at owning this awesome little guy I will unfortunately have to impose the rule of **one per person**.~~

~~Anyhoo, I hope this helps spread a little happiness to the folks here that have helped me out so much. I have X-Mas appearances to make tonight and tomorrow so I will be busy the next two days. I'm leaving for my parents' house as soon as I post this and most likely won't be able to check things until later on tonight. It may take me a while to reply to all of you so please be patient. I will, however, try my best to post an up to date list of who is getting one and which one they are getting so check back if you haven't received a reply. As for the trades themselves, I would like to keep them interesting, because let's face it nobody likes a box full of Bidoof :P, but anything will be acceptable and none shall be refused as this is indeed a giveaway!!!~~

There is already a color-coded link system to tell different generation trades apart, but what if the links also had some sort of ""Trade Completed!"" notification next to the link?

[/r/tipofmytongue](http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue) has a similar system in place, where the submitter can post the word ""SOLVED!"" in a message and a little check mark appears next to the post.  The process is handled through an automated bot, and the most a moderator may do is prompt the submitter to write ""SOLVED!""

This addition could make scanning for people who need assistance much more effective.  A glance at the PT front page could show who has completed a trade and who hasn't, instead of going through each thread individually and wading through all the comments only to realize that the pokemon I could have offered was 4 hours too late to the party.

Can we make this happen, mods of PokemonTrades?

It took three games, 700 hours, a good IRL friend, and many of the kind people at /r/pokemontrades.  That's why I've decided to give back what I can.  For the next two hours, I will be giving away any breedable to those who ask for it.  Please specify if you would like it in an egg or at level one.  All requests made before 12:05 EST will be honored, but know that I may not get to yours until later than that.  I'll also help evolve your pokemon via trade.

The Rules:

Due to the expected steady traffic, I've decided that you may only ask for up to five pokemon per post, and must wait five minutes before you post again.  There is no limit to the number of times you may post.  If you don't have FC flair, please tell me what it is in the comment, as I would like to keep this going as smoothly as possible.

**Newest update: this is the important part**

This looks to be ready to roll. Please excuse the first month if things don't go quite so smoothly while things get settled and worked out. I've left the other edits in place for reference (so some of the comments make sense), but this is the important part.

Here are the rules for the Egg Swap:

1. Subreddit rules still apply (hacked, illegal pokes not allowed, and if a way exists to scam via eggs, it's still not allowed)



2. You must have filled out **[this registration form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&amp;formkey=dDZhWUdHcm5ob1BsLS1jc1VKSEJKcmc6MQ)** before 23:00 Pacific 14th of the month. These are timestamped automatically. 

3. Partnerships (and FC's) will be sent as close to 00:01 Pacific on the 15th of every month, as early as possible but not before. This first month will most likely be midday or evening on the 15th to make up for the short notice.

4. It is 100% your responsibility to make contact with your assigned partner and arrange a trade. You'll be given their reddit username and FC, and they will have yours.

5. If you want to trade more than 1 egg with a person, that's fine and dandy. Only report the first one (see below), and make sure your partner is aware that you're bringing a bunch of eggs so they can do the same.

6. After you're assigned, you have until the following 10th (23:59 Pacific) to make the trade. For example, if you participate in this first Swap, the trade must have been completed by May 10th.

7. After you Swap, you are required to fill out **[the feedback form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE9kTjlDbjNjX1lPbUFvOG14SXd0RkE6MQ)** before the 23:59 Pacific on the 11th (i.e. May 11th). Failure to do so will result in a warning, and possible exclusion from future Swaps. **The results of this form will be available to the public.**

8. If you'd like to trade with more than 1 person for month, I'll be happy to set you up with someone else who has already finished when a partner is available. Please make a note of this on the feedback form above.

9. If, for any reason, you don't want to trade with someone, please fill out the feedback form before any trade occurs, noting ‘REFUSED’ in the required pokemon fields. They will be contacted ASAP with a new partner. You will not be able to be re-matched for that month, and this refusal will be publicly available.  No refusal will be accepted after the 1st of the new month.

10. If, for any reason the community judges your trade exceedingly unfair or a 'dud', you will be warned once. 

11. 2 warnings will be investigated; there is a possibility of banning from the program. 3 or more warnings will always result in a ban from the program. I don't have a ban list set up and I don't want to start one, so please trade with Karma in mind.

If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment below or PM me. I realize there are a lot of 'rules', and I'm not always as clear as I'd like to be. It should be relatively straightforward, I'd just like to head off any problems as early as possible.

---

**EDIT 1:**

After thinking on this a lot, and talking the idea out with a few friends, here's the direction I'd like to go with this idea. Pending all sorts of changes, feedback, etc. what follows is a list of what I'd **like** to do with this.

1. To participate in the coming month's Swap, you need to have 'registered' (gotten me your FC, probably through an online form or something) by the 14th of the month.

2. On the 15th, I'll PM people via reddit who their designated partner is for the month.

3. It is then on both of you to make contact, and make the Egg Swap happen before the next month's 10th day (4 days-ish to give me some time to prepare, breathe, etc.)

4. After you've made the first Swap of the month, (with your permission) I'll add your FC to a more visible document so you can trade with others who are also finished and want to trade more eggs.

5. If something goes wrong, there'd be a system in place for you to report that sort of thing. No immediate expulsion from the fun, but after a few reports (with warnings, of course) I'd just stop including them.

---

**OP**

I've beengetting more in to trading lately, and one of my favorite things is to trade egg for egg. It's addictive, like playing the lottery!

A few of my local friends and I even started playing 3-poke monte: 2 decent eggs, 1 bidoof, hope you each guess wisely. This is beside the point, but brought up as an example of neat things you can do.

I'd like to do a day a week (or month, what not) and trade a random egg for a random egg with people from reddit. Obviously there's not a good way to enforce any sort of rules, but the usual Karma does apply: if all you ever give are useless pokes, eventually that's all anyone will give.

Thoughts? Feel free to tell me it's a horrible idea. I realize it's going to be challenging, logistically. Maybe you can enter FC's in to a pool, and match people up once a month to trade egg(s)?

I was wondering how people would feel about having another list in the sidebar with the OT information of found hacks. That way, even if something passed Pokecheck, you could know that hacked pokemon from that OT has been found before so it's best to assume anything from that OT is hacked.

Like earlier tonight, /u/atoastfan had a hacked shiny Uxie that they didn't know about with an OT of JEFFREY and an ID of 33223/33793 so you would probably want to avoid anything from that OT.

This is an ongoing current event in Korea, and I've been farming as time permits over the past couple of weeks.  I do have a few more available if needed, but atm I'm saving them for myself/future trades.

I haven't been around on this sub for too long, but from what I've seen, there's not a lot of events floating around that aren't japan/us.  So hopefully there'll be a lot of interest, and I plan on farming future events as I have time also since I finally got a Korean W2 a few weeks ago.

Anyways, I don't have a bunch of specific things I'm looking for.  I'd love a Shiny Magikarp event, and really just other foreign events in general.  I'll consider shinies, but probably would only take 3:1 or 4:1 on bredables, or 1:1 on Legends.  Feel free to just make an offer though, as I'll consider pretty much anything.  It's hard telling from day to day what will pique my interest :D

* Personally I think 4th gen trading needs it's own subreddit, but that's just my opinion.

* I liked the idea of tagging the post nsfw when you're done.

* Zorua's are not rare. I see many post offering zoruas for legends and stuff.

* Although you may get lucky, it is extremely rare someone is going to pretty much giveaway shinys or events.

* Pokecheck stuff please, it's easy to do and there are instructions on the homepage of pokecheck.

* Everyone should get their FC beside their name.

* There is a link in the sidebar to an explanation on how to trade, so stop asking people to explain it to you.

* Put LF/FT in the title please, it makes everything so much easier.

* If someone is doing a giveaway, put your FC in your comment, that way they can just look at their inbox and see your FC instantly.

* Stop saying ""FT: Ask, or FT: Offers"" Then we don't know what you have and it's just annoying.

And that's pretty much it.

EDIT: More points

* Posts asking about wifi advice or pokecheck assurance etc isn't what this subreddit is about.

I can provide pics of the disk / case if needed. 
Gen 4 or 5. 

I was looking for the following - Dream world Eevee, Dream world Nidoran(female), Dream world Gligar, Deoxys, Darkrai, Shaymin, Celebi, Mew, Manaphy, and Phione. 

Of course I'll also accept any reasonable trades as well :) 
Sorry if the above list is ridiculous! 
Depending on the feedback I get it may take me a few days to get enough Jirachis since I'm going to be busy and every Jirachi requires me to make a new save file on Ruby.



One last thing... I don't know how to find my friend code.
Like I said, I'm all new to this wifi trading.

Thanks!  

**EDIT**: I didn't expect this many replies, I don't have enough Jirachis yet, but I'm going to get to work on them asap. I should have them ready around Saturday, sorry for the delay!

If anyone wants anything I can get you it as long as it can be breed, that includes starters and rare pokemon from the earlier generations.  

I also have a Japanese version of White and if you'd like I can get you Japanese pokemon from White for all of your shiny breeding needs.  That includes dittos, but it'd be easier for me to get you just the pokemon you want to try for shiny since dittos are sort of a pain to catch (but if you really want one, I can get you one easily enough).

I also can infect any traded pokemon with pokerus upon request and also I'm willing to breed egg moves on to you pokemon (including some egg moves that require gen IV breeding to get, such as a Turtwig with stealth rock and leech seed for all of your Ferrothorn breeding needs).

I also have two shinies.  Machamp, and Durant.  I may be willing to trade these for other shinies, but I'd have to prefer that shiny to mine to make the trade.  (Durant is the best bet if you want to get your hands on one of these)

I don't really need anything in return.  If possible though, I'm still looking for an Oshawott, Gothita, and Sawk, and if you are feeling really generous, I need a life orb in Gen V.  If you don't have any of these to give away though, just send me whatever Patrats or Lilipups you have lying around.

My friend code is 3782 8989 5634.  I'll be up and ready to make some trades for the next couple of hours and then back again tomorrow at some point.

EDIT1: Oops, typed my friend code in wrong, its 3782 not 3982.

EDIT2: I got Oshawott, Sawk, and Gothita taken care of.  If you have a life orb that you would give away, I still need that, if not, anything works.

EDIT3: I'm done for tonight, although I'll make sure to be on tomorrow to get anybody any of the pokemon they are looking for.  Just leave a post and I'll make sure to find what you are looking for tomorrow.

EDIT4: I'm back and filling out the remaining requests here.  Feel free to keep the requests coming though, I'm always ready to help.

Il probably only be doing them for an hour or so, unless I have nothing else to do later.

Rules:

- I will be doing 3 each for now, unless I have time for more.

- Please comment with how many checks you want done, along with the FC you will be using.

- I will reply when i am ready. If you don't reply within a couple of minutes, il have to move on with more checks

- When I message you, please PM me your e-mail to send the checks to. It makes it much quicker to do the checks.

- Please stay in the room when I check. It takes about a minute to do so. Most of the time is spent trading/waiting to trade.

I really want that shiny Pidove, I'm not too bothered about the Vulpix, but if anyone has it, it is Adamant with Flash Fire, with the OT Kate I think, that or Roxy. I've checked Pokecheck to see if anyone still has them on pokecheck, but it looks like they aren't up.

Thanks to everyone who was able to trade me one of the pokes I needed!**

Been trying to breed a perfect Ferrothorn, so of course I have a lot of guys who were good when I started, but are no longer needed in my quest to play god.

These guys are just taking up space in my boxes and I really don't want them anymore. Please feel free to take them off my hands. They have been stripped of their original identities and are known only by number (all their nicknames are just numbers, made it easier on me for breeding). I will provide IV's for the ones I know.

Once again, all of them have leech seed and spikes as egg moves as well as 0 speed. Most of them have 1 perfect IV or at least a 30. Without further adieu, here's the list:

Note: Some of these guys were thrown into the love pit for a night or two of debauchery. So not all of them are lvl 1, but none of them have any EVs (or at least they shouldn't).

Pokemons I want:

I know we have all seen these postings. They crop up at least once every few weeks, but, as someone who has been unknowingly traded hacked pokemon recently, I really wanted to toss a post up for some of the newer members to the community.

 * Trading Hacked Pokemon is Forbidden

 * Trading Cloned Pokemon is Forbidden

 * Screenshots do not *always* suffice (e.g. certain events).

 * Not sure if the Pokecheck means the Pokemon is hacked? Ask a valued community member. (If you haven't been here long enough to know who they are, make a post asking about it. That is why we are a sub, a community, to help each other.)

 * Need an Event checked? Look around - Every day there are posts made about people Event checking pokemon because they know how important it is we keep this sub clear of hacked/cloned pokemon.

 * Not sure about someone? Check the Reddit Username's age. If the account is a day old, maybe ask for some more solid verification if they aren't giving any. Account age is something often overlooked, if someone needs a throwaway to trade Pokemon I would question that. Ask around.

I know how important dex is to some people. I know how important shiny is to some people, but trading hacked or cloned pokemon goes against the founding ideals of this community. The people who trade you hacked pokemon often move on to trade more hacked pokemon for legit pokemon and then just leave. They will not make valued contributions to this community in most cases, so where does /r/pokemontrades benefit?

I appeal to the individuals, the ones who would make the trade because it simply benefits themselves. Think about the integrity of the sub, and of yourself. Purposely trading hacked pokemon to unsuspecting users is just wrong. Don't do it. 

If you read this far I appreciate the time you spent doing so; I hope this posting helped. If you need information on services provided here, or have any questions please feel free to message the moderators or check out our sidebar for more details.

There are many other resources these are just a few!

**TL;DR: Trading a Shiny/Event/Legendary/Not-So-Sure-Special Pokemon? Get a Pokecheck first because without it the trade is illegitimate. Be smart for yourself, and others.

/u/Minister_of_truth suggested test pokécheck first by using a random pokemon like a Patrat, so that way you don't mess up and make it public. Ask for help here on this sub first, as seeing your own pokemon from your IP changes. You might be able to see a pokemon but it's private to us.

**If you have an unregistered account/game only the ''unclaimed from my IP'' is important. If it's registered, go to Manage my Pokemon instead**

* Go to unclaimed from my IP on pokecheck. Under the box of the pokemon it will say ''associate this pokemon with my account. Click that. **Do not make the pokemon public or private. Public means it's a download, private means it's unseeable**

* Go to account options and you'll see an option ''allow other users to see legality analysis of my non public pokemon'' and save that.

Your pokemon will be then set on a [neutral status](http://i.imgur.com/cFatr.png?1) and the legality analysis will be able to be seen. (Imgur photo by /u/DanTheRip) 

And there you go, your pokemon is now on pokecheck and is able to viewed without being a download/private. Good luck trading and have a nice day. 

Edit - How to link a box.

* Create a new box. Pokecheck has a default box that is unable to be linked. So let's say I wanted a box with my Smeargle for trade. 

* Go to manage my pokemon and there will be ''box management'' with Existing boxes and create a new box. Name it 'smeargle'' and click create. Then set ''Smeargle'' as your active box 

* Once you made your box, start uploading pokemon to pokecheck. 

* Once all your pokemon are in the desired box, you will see ''enable public view'' Click that. Then you will see ''open public view'' so then click that. Copy the link. [Here's my Smeargle!](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=1&amp;u=7asses)

How to link a screenshot without imgur 

* Pick any pokemon you want the screenshot of. At the end of the analysis, it will say ''download screenshot with legality analysis''. Click that and copy the link. [Here's another Smeargle as an example](http://www.pokecheck.org/?screenshot=3091299&amp;la)

1) Go into your router settings on your pc. (For example: on my qwest router you have to type in 192.168.0.1 in the address bar on my web browser)

2) Go to the wireless security settings and change the security type from WPA (or whatever it's set as) to WEP.

3) Make the authentication type is ""shared"" and use the custom key/passphrase to what you want. This will be the password for any device you want to connect in the future (ie. Laptop, Game console, etc.)

4) Set to 64 bits, if you have the option

5) Turn on your DS/DSi/3DS and go to ""System Settings"" then ""Internet Settings""

6) If you're on the DS/DSi, go to ""Connection Settings"". 3DS users go to ""Nintendo DS Connections"" and select OK

I'll notify everyone before we trade.*** *Adenundum to EDIT 5: Turns out that the last time that I tried to switch my flair, it didn't go through, so the FC I posted above is the same as the flair as of 7:45PM CST (I just sent in a message requesting a new flair be put in). Anyways, to clear up any confusion, the FC where I'll be RECEIVING your Pokemon is 1378-5391-4881, and the one where I will be GIVING you yours is 2366-1949-4974.  I apologize for any confusion!*

**EDIT: Breeding does count as UT and they automatically come in Poke Balls.  I'd prefer the legendaries not be PokeTransferred because of name capitalization.  Also, if you have a lower evolution, feel free to evolve it by grinding it up in the wild.  A few EVs won't kill me, nor will a few odd moves.  Just no nicknames, please.**

**EDIT 2: I actually will need Pokechecks for ALL Pokemon, legendaries or otherwise, to confirm their UT status and Poke Ball.  I also have a shit ton of Pokemon to RNG now, so please be patient with me.  I have work and school, so it might be slow going, but I promise that I'm good for all trades.  Thank you to everyone!**

~~**EDIT 3: I have all of the regular Pokémon taken care of, so all I need now are the legendaries, which are 1:1 shinies.**~~

**EDIT 4: All Pokemon are accounted for, and as soon as I get all of the regular Pokemon trades outta the way, I'll mark the thread Completed.  Thank you all for your help!**

I'm a bit OCD about my Pokemon.  I catch all of my Pokemon in Poke Balls and all of my legendaries in Premier Balls.  I only have a copy of Black 2, so I can't go through all the trouble to do this myself, so I figure I'll pay adequately for a set of **untrained** White 2 exclusives in **Poke Balls** and nothing else.  Just to ensure this, I will need Pokechecks for the Pokemon.  I've been cheated out of shinies in past, so I'm going to be a bit more cautious this time, so I apologize for the inconvenience. 

Anyways, here are the Pokemon I need:

- ~~Caterpie~~
- ~~Metapod~~
- ~~Butterfree~~
- ~~Mime Jr.~~
- ~~Mr. Mime~~
- ~~Elekid~~
- ~~Electabuzz~~
- ~~Electrivire~~
- ~~Pinsir~~
- ~~Ledyba~~
- ~~Ledian~~
- ~~Skitty~~
- ~~Delcatty~~
- ~~Minun~~
- ~~Illumise~~
- ~~Numel~~
- ~~Camerupt~~
- ~~Glameow~~
- ~~Purugly~~
- ~~Petilil~~
- ~~Liligant~~
- ~~Solosis~~
- ~~Duosion~~
- ~~Reuniclus~~
- ~~Rufflet~~
- ~~Braviary~~
- ~~Archen~~
- ~~Archeops~~
- ~~Caracosta~~

I don't expect any one person to get *all* of these Pokemon for me, so I will RNG **one** Pokemon (you can choose the IVs, nature, ability, shininess, gender, etc.) of your choosing for every **six** of these Pokemon you can give me.  I hope that's enough considering the particularity of my request, haha!  Of course, if someone gives me **twelve** Pokemon, I'll give him or her two RNG'd shinies.  In fact, if you give me **ten** Pokemon, I'll round up to six and still give you **two** shinies in return.  Again, I do need Pokechecks to verify the untrained status and Poke Ball.

I don't expect this to happen overnight either, so please feel free to put in an offer, and that way we both have time to fulfill our sides of the bargain.  It'll be first-come-first-serve, but if I'm unable to reach you for an extended period of time after I've finished your Pokemon, I'll move on to the next offer, so KIT.

*If you've already caught your legendaries, you can probably stop reading here.*

Now, since I don't have a copy of White 2, I'll still need the legendaries from the game.  Like I said, I catch all of my legendaries in **Premier Balls** and I hope to keep my collection that way.  So, I make you this offer: I'll give you **one** RNG'd shiny of your choice for **each untrained legendary caught in a Premier Ball.**  The legendaries I need are:

- ~~Reshiram~~
- ~~Regice~~
- ~~Latias~~

I will need Pokechecks for these guys as well.

I think that I've been more than fair in my overtly OCD request, but maybe I can get some shinies into some shiniless hands while I'm at it :)  Leave a comment below if you can help me out, and we'll start working out a deal.  If you can offer to catch more than just six Pokemon, wait to see if I can get some more offers and get some shinies to other people, but if I can't find anyone else to fill the order, I'll most definitely hit you up.  Thank you all!

I think gamefreak should put in some system where players can flag trade offers like that, or program their GTN so that when people put in the pokemon they are looking for, it only makes level selection based on the minimum level that pokemon can be found.

First come, first serve. No limit. Anything you don't take I'm just going to release so don't be shy. 

I will check in periodically throughout the day. Make sure to reserve the Pokemon you want.

~~Trading shall begin later tonight, around 7:30pm PST.~~

Trades will commence in the order the responses to my message are received.

Trades can be saved for a later date but **not** earlier.

You have one full calendar week to claim your prize unless you let me know that you can't collect it in that time-span. If you do not it goes to the next person who wanted it.

Also be on the lookout for my Super Pokemon Giveaway coming sometime in the next few weeks in celebration of me completing my very first National Pokedex. 

**Edit:** Time for sleep, I'll check back in the morning before class.

**Morning Edit:** Everyone seems to love Sudowoodo so I shall breed him for anybody who wanted one.

**Morning Edit 2:** Only 5 left.

**Edit 3:** A little late but let the trading ***begin***!

**Edit 4:** Everything went snafu, so Ill get to each person as I can. The order went out the window.

It goes like this, I ask the community for 1 egg from 6 people and use those 6 eggs as my team throughout the game. Unfortunately due to trading mechanics the first gym has to be beaten, but this is offset by the huge amount of grind it will take to become master near the end.


What I'm looking for is 6 generous trainers to each donate ONE egg, the pokemon doesn't matter (although I prefer no normal types). I will update you as I progress through the game, and hopefully start something new here (much like the recent nuzlocke craze).


Are any of you willing to breed something FUN/SURPRISING/AMAZINGLY OP/TERRIBLE for me to tackle Pokemon White with? Keep in mind if you all pick something terrible I might cry.


If you're in do NOT tell me what is in the egg, and let me know when you want to trade (I'll be on for another hour or so, then later tomorrow for many hours).

Lapras - Cthulhu

Eevee (so cute!!) - Maltmaker

Rufflet - Elvisnake

Croagunk - Reecoli

Axew - Adrian_Moriarti

Lotad - Arbitraryletters

It would allow you to send Pokemon to a database (similar to Pokecheck, but you would lose said Pokemon). These Pokemon would then be held on a server and connecting to download would give you a random Pokemon. Hopefully this would allow users to dump their breeding leftovers for others to access. Not sure how this would work in practice, as I would like the speed of depositing to Pokecheck, but with the Pokemon being deleted from the DS (without playing that long animation every time). 

I've already started looking into this, and I'm hoping to do it in Python (there are some open source projects that already deal with connecting to a DS).

So, I can't technically do a giveaway here, but I got the last event Pokemon that I needed: Deoxys, which was the whole reason I even started trading shinies.  So, basically, I don't really need these guys anymore.  But, I felt it would be better to reintroduce the shinies back into the /r/pokemontrades economy rather than have it end up in some 12-year-old's PC box over at /r/pokemongiveaway.  Seriously though, guys, use /r/pokemongiveaway.  It's a good way to be generous, and a good way to get Pokemon that you have nothing to trade for.  And, if more of you browsed over there, then I wouldn't feel so bad about posting a shiny giveaway over there. But, since this *is* in /r/pokemontrades, I'm only accepting Pokemon that I don't have in my PokeDex yet.  It shouldn't be too bad, but there will be at least a little bartering done here, so just lemme know what you have that's an evolved form of an in-gen Pokemon, or pretty much any out-of-gen Poke. Anyways, follow the rules below or you won't be participating.

**Rules:**

- Shinies are only open to people who don't have shinies yet
- I will not trade with new accounts as to actually give shinies to people who don't have them.  Sorry if you're new, it's just a precaution.
- One shiny per person
- Legendaries are open to everybody
- Two legendaries per person
- We need to trade for something that I don't already have as to consider this a trade and not a giveaway
- If you don't follow the rules, I won't be trading with you.

**Shinies:**

- ~~Aggron~~
- ~~Crobat~~
- ~~Dustox~~
- ~~Liepard~~

**Legendaries:**

- ~~Groudon~~
- ~~Lugia~~
- ~~Moltres~~
- ~~Rayquaza~~
- ~~Reshiram~~
- ~~Uxie~~
- ~~Virizion~~
- ~~Zapdos~~
- ~~Zekrom~~

First off, from **DizzyDrone**:

&gt; I've recently been playing pokemon black on my pc using an emulator, and I want to do some trading and battling. I have already done some trades with people I know (and who know that I'm playing from my pc) without any problems (aside from a constantly changing friend code) and I was wondering if it would be concidered hacking and against the rules to trade with people from /r/pokemontrades. Obviously I won't be trading with anyone if you feel this is the case.

&gt; Thanks in advance for the answer

Basically, he's using the enabled version of DSEMU that allows you to connect to Wifi like a regular DS, only, via an emulator.

**lolcoster** replied with:
&gt; As long as these are pokemon that you're catching legitimately (no AR or pokesav) then it should be fine. If you want to trade, perhaps it would be best if you warned the person you want to trade with beforehand, saying in your post that you're on an emulator.

&gt;Just don't cheat and you should be fine.

Just a reminder, even if he's not running on a DS, his Pokemon ARE legit. He worked just as hard to train his Pokemon. The real issue lies in how easy it is to hack those Pokemon.

As usual, when your trading with someone, double check what your getting in case that persons trying to trade you a hack. Things like starters being caught in anything other than a Pokeball, or ""Too good to be true"" trades are dead giveaways.

If you happen to be using an emulator for a trade, **TELL THE PERSON YOUR TRADING WITH THAT YOUR USING AN EMULATOR.**

Next, on 3rd Party GTS's, from **epyonmx**:

&gt; A few days back I posted about finding a Mew for my copy of HeartGold. I missed the event, and wanted to see if I could find one.

&gt;Someone responded with 151GTS, a server that collected event pokemon and made them available for download. None of the posts were flagged or deleted and I don't believe the pokemon are hacked, but I'm curious about how the community would react to me using the pokemon in a battle with other people.

&gt;I have no problem using the mew I downloaded in my own game. It reminds me of my Mew from Yellow, and I'm not talking about fielding a team of 6 level 70 Entei's (which I didn't download). But would I be run out of the subreddit on a rail if I used my mew? or another one of the pokemon from the site?

&gt;Thoughts?

and my Reply: 

&gt; Those websites produce ""Legal"" Pokemon , not ""Legit"" Pokemon . They ARE hacked, but they are perfectly legal (stats should be correct, moves are fine).

&gt; I'm not a fan of these sites. To me, it defeats the purpose. If your gonna get exactly the Pokemon you want through one of these sites rather than trade for it/catch it and train it up, why not just play Pokemon online and get whatever the hell team you want and not have drop $30 - $40 on the game in the first place?

&gt; However, my feelings on third party GTS's and Legendary (event) Pokemon are a different story. What you did is fine, your not being lazy, you just can't have possibly gotten that Mew ever, which is disappointing. When it comes to legendaries, knock yourself out. Just keep in mind a few things so people don't get pissy at you:

&gt; *    Make sure they're legit (check up the Serebii site for the stats on the event Mew and make sure they're the same)
&gt; *    Make sure explain to the person your battling against that your Mew, while ""hacked"" is legal.
&gt; *    Never, (if you even can) ever trade it. Legit Mews are supposed to be rare. The MyPokemonRanch one is the best example. If suddenly we have 3000 mews on Pokemon trades, all of which hacked off of this 151GTS site, the effect of ""I'm trading a mew, make me an offer"" diminishes.

&gt; That being said, Mew is in Smogons Uber tier, meaning it'll banned from most competitive tournaments anyway (including RPL) so you might not have to worry about that.

&gt; Hmm, I'm going to make a post about this on r/trades, just to gauge other peoples opinions on it.

Even though I knew I had checked it, I didn't have it in any of my boxes. I thought perhaps I deleted it by accident.

Now for the weird stuff:

I checked the Kyurem and discovered I had the first check still on Pokecheck. (new check for reference: https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=detail&amp;uid=4801417)

Going through my old posts, I found where I had posted a question of it's value: http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/1cs2da/5th_question_how_much_would_a_nonrngd_shiny/

As you can tell by the check, it is telling everyone (including myself) that the Pokemon is private. I cannot change this.

Now before anyone says it, I can confirm that the pokemon was claimed. I remember even moving it to a different box when I reorganized my pokemon. 

My question is, **WHERE THE HELL DID THE FIRST POKECHECK GO, AND WHY CAN'T I ACCESS IT?!**

Also, this pokecheck account is the only one I use, so it's not a case of mistaken accounts.

EDIT 1: I've sent a message to feedback. I'll update if this is settled or if I get a response.~~

* Only 2 pokemon per person, as I said I only have little time also to prevent people from waiting too long

* Post your FC if its not on your flair

* The check will be deleted the following day so take a screenshot !!

* Wait for your turn, I will reply when its your turn afterwards please wait until I contact you

* In the room either be ready with a trade invitation or wait for me to contact you, it makes things easier

* Please after 8 people have posted do not post, even though I would like to help you right now I dont have enough time. Again sorry.

The rules for this giveaway is going to be a lot different than my first 3, which consisted of guessing random numbers.

I've picked up some ideas from [/r/sharedota2](/r/sharedota2) which I will be applying for this giveaway.

The Winner will be able to choose any Pokemon off my **[Shiny List](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/s9zp6/4th_5th_lf_shinies_ft_various_shinies/)**.

**Note**: If your desired Shiny is in 4th gen, I will have it transferred to 5th.

Rules on how to enter:

1. Your Reddit Account must be atleast 3 months old. (To prevent people from using multiple accounts to enter)

2. Your Link and Comment Karma **combined**, must be atleast 300.

3. Must have made contributions (posts) in either [/r/pokemon](/r/pokemon) or [/r/pokemontrades](/r/pokemontrades).

4. Your favorite Pokemon.

To make sure everyone has read my post, please post a random animal name with rule number Four. Three Random winners who meets all these criteria will be chosen at the end of the day around **8-10PM EST**.

**EDIT: Sorry I should've mentioned, you DON'T have to post anything about Rules 1 - 3. I will check the accounts myself.**

**EDIT 2**: Since my professor decided to reduce the number of papers my class needs to write and this is turning out to be an awesome week, I've decided to pick **3 winners in total!** Winners will be chosen from 1 - 3, 1st winner has priority on their pick, 2nd winner has second, 3rd winner has last pick.

**EDIT 3**: Choosing Second winner after Sephrix confirms his priority pick.

For those that were able to make it to see me I hope you guys enjoyed this day as much as I have. Every pokemon traded out today had this thing called Pokerus. For those of you who don't know it is a virus that can spread from each member of your team through battling. It will leave a pokemon on the third midnight it is left out of a box. To keep simply stick it in a pc box and it will be safe. If it does happen to leave a pokemon do not fear. The effects of it stay forever. How ever it can no longer be passed on to other pokemon. 

For those who were unable to get your pokemon today I am sorry but I have closed this giveaway. I however will be making another giveaway within the next few weeks I will post a date and the new pokemon. I will give you guys the first opportunity at the new/old (if you would still like them). I will keep this list as what I did not accomplish to make sure.

Next Giveaway: I will make a post saying the next day, what pokemon will be available to obtain, and order time frames. How it will work is I stop taking orders the day before and work all day that day breeding and fixing everything up. That will give you guys/girls ample time as well to get together what ever you would like. I will always do a [5th] during my giveaways.

Once again, like I have stated previously, (now deleted as to not make this too long) this was my only day I could do this I will be searching for a job here in the near future and will be bouncing from my cousins place to my girlfriends place to widen my opportunity window. While at his place I can not trade because his internet has a password and anyone who has traded/done anything with Nintendo wifi knows you can not use protected internet. Back on topic, I am leaving tomorrow/today for his place. Have fun for now guys and see you soon

1330990756.0,7,self.pokemontrades,qjaqp,[5th] Birthday Giveaway! Lotto Style,11,4,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/qjaqp/5th_birthday_giveaway_lotto_style/,"So my birthday is coming up. I'm giving away 26 pokemon to 26 people because... guess what? I'm turning 26 soon.

----
The Prizes
----

Some are pokemon I gave away before (Ditto, Terrakion), and some are completely new. I wanted to go for the under appreciated pokemon of Unova that no one wants (like Druddigon and Cryogonal), but I also have some rare prizes like the Unova starters and *gasp!* DW Torchic. 

All of the pokemon are shiny (except 1). You can see everything I am giving away **[HERE](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=5&amp;u=cocky).**

I've also been playing around with Trick Room, hence why a few pokemon have -Speed natures and 0 IVs in Speed. 

All of these pokemon were [RNG abused](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pseudo-random_number_generation_in_Pok%C3%A9mon#RNG_Abuse) and cloned. The DW Torchic wasn't rnged by me, but it should be legal. 

----
How to play
----
ALL 26 SLOTS ARE FILLED! 

~~This giveaway is.. Lotto Style!~~

~~I assigned a random number to each pokemon, from 1 to 26. Pick 3 numbers and comment in this thread with the 3 numbers you chose. I'll meet you in the wifi room with 3 pokemon and you may pick **only 1 out of the 3.** I'm only taking the first 26 entries.~~

Thanks for everybody that wanted to participate! I'll breed everything up tonight and begin messaging the recipients as their gift hatches! Happy holidays, everyone!

~~Thanks to the mighty efforts of over a dozen redditors and about 50 hours of tedious slogging through the dream world, I have managed to acquire all the DW pokemon. I would like to give back to the community that helped me out so much, so I decided to give away some DW pokemon to you guys as my holiday gift.~~

~~I shall give to the first 10 unique redditors a single DW female (or male, in the case of Nidoran and Volbeat/Illumise). You can choose from any DW pokemon that was legitimately released (this includes Japanese-only DW pokemon) and can get its DW ability through breeding. Please [check out this link](http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3454925) for a list of all the released DW Pokemon.~~

~~**NOTE:** *This means I can't trade DW starters, genderless pokes, Tauros, or anything not in the link above.*~~

~~Just a few of the ones you can request:~~

* Abra
* Aerodactyl
* Chansey (Japan-only)
* Dratini
* Eevee (Japan-only)
* Growlithe
* Natu
* Poliwag
* Sableye
* Vulpix
* ...And a whole lot more!


~~I'm generally free on weeknights from around 6:00PM CST until midnight, and by appointment on weekends. Depending on the gender ratio of the pokemon you ask for, it may take a while to get it for you; so please don't get angry that I can't get your *free* pokemon to you fast enough. If you're feeling generous, I will gladly accept pokemon from previous generations or evolutionary stones, but junk pokemon are perfectly acceptable, too.~~

~~I will do my best to check timestamps on the comments to ensure everything is as fair as possible. I reserve the right to change the conditions of this giveaway at any time, though I will try my best to accommodate your wishes.~~

~~GO, INTERNET! GO, GO, GO!!!~~

I'm breeding Growlithe with Morning Sun, Close Combat, and Flare Blitz.  Most should have perfect HP/Attack IVs (if I did this right) and will become appropriately monstrous Arcanine with sunny weather.  I also still have about a box of Scraggy with Drain Punch and 28 eggs that no one wanted during the egg exchanges.  

I'll breed Growlithe off and on all day, but I'll be available to trade starting at **9 PM EST** (unless something comes up, in which case I'll edit this).  I'll take any interesting (IV bred, egg move) pokemon you have, or most things from previous gens.

**EDIT**  Okay, that's a lot of people.  I'm gonna be breeding frantically until 9 PM EST when I'll be ready to get online (I'll put up another edit to confirm), and I should be up until at least midnight.  If that time doesn't work for you, I'd be glad to hold on to one until you're available.  It looks like most everyone wants a male, so I'll try to get as many as I can set.

**EDIT 2** So I guess I'm really bad at breeding or something, because only the last few I bred came out with perfect Attack and HP (even though I never switched the held power items...) but I believe I have enough good Growlithe that I won't have to trade one that doesn't have at least 1 perfect IV.  I'm heading into the room now, and I'll post something here if I need to leave for a bit.  

**ALSO** The markings on the Growlithe correspond to their perfect IV (1st mark is HP, 2nd mark Attack, etc)

Would those *children* be accepted as trades here? (Movesets are always 100% legal according to what the father can[bulbapedia] legitimately learn in gen V. If its a gen 4 poke I go back and breed it in diamond the old fashioned way and rare candy to check IV's)

These are the Pokemon I have available:

Axew

Chansey

Absol

Porygon x ~8

Beldum x 1, also have a Metang you could have

Archen

Deino x 7

Larvesta x 4 

Ferroseed with Spikes and Leech Seed

Lapras

Larvitar x 10

Gastly x 4

Ralts. 5 Jolly Ralts, 9 Modest Ralts

Mienfoo x 5

Scraggy with Dragon Dance x 10

Drilbur x 8

Joltik x 10

Deerling with Agility x 18

If there isn't a x # after it that means I have more than I think I would trade away. I should be available to trade most of today, most of the week, and even this weekend if you reserve a certain pokemon for me to not throw away. Once I clean up my boxes I plan on breeding next some Litwicks, Pawniards, Bagons with Dragon Dance and Hydro Pump, and Lotads. :D

edit: If you want something please comment on this page, as it helps me keep everyones trades more organized instead of having to go through messages. Thanks!

edit2: sorry about being gone, my mom had to use the computer. I'm back! Give me a couple minutes to add everyone, also I no longer need those two starters, but anything unique, obscure, rare is always appreciated

edit3: while I was gone I was able to breed a little bit more and now have 5 Bagons, 5 Lotads, and 3 Pawniards if  anyone wants them

That is, I wanna start trading with the big dogs xD

So here it goes: to the active traders of this subreddit (those who regularly trade ribboned events), do you (still) have a Living Dex full of events that you refuse to trade? If so, do you value those events more than than the ones you're willing to trade? I mean, is it worth keeping your rarest pokes on display?

I know answers to this question greatly vary from user to trainer, where some people just farm events. I also know that preference is a factor, where some people don't even care about a Living Dex.

When trading events (especially if you can't pokecheck events), if you guys ask the person you are trading with to send you the save pokecheck file, of the pokemon you are trading through email, you can upload them to pokecheck (any pokemon including events) without having to go through the trouble of finding someone to pokecheck the event for you. Hopefully this helps people out! Have an incredible night everyone.

EDIT: For people who want directions: On the bottom of a pokemon that you (or in the case of a trade, the person has) it will say ""Download .pkm file"". So you click on that, then you download the file. Than you can email that file to the person who you are trading with. And they can ""Import Gen 5 .pkm file"" on their pokecheck and voula.

[I have a reference thread here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/poketradereferences/comments/1f0i3g/cryophantoms_reference/) with a few people I've done checks for having commented.  I am being considered for a masterball atm, so if you do get a check done and are satisfied with the service, I would appreciate a good word be put in.

In order to get checks done for multiple people, I'm going to limit the amount being done at once to **3 checks**.  I'm not asking for anything in return for the service except a good word in my reference thread.

As for the process, It'll just be first come first serve for the most part.  Though, if I see someone has a trade that is pending on a check, I might skip ahead and prioritize them.  During the check, please stay in the room, as it will only take a minute for me to hop off and dump the .pkm files.  Also, when we start trading, you have two choices as far as pokecheck goes.  Either pm me your username and a temporary password and I'll upload them to your account, or pm me a name to use for a new account which I will create and then give you the password to.

* Most everything seems to match up (dates, Japanese, et cetera)

Cons: 

* Nothing was asked in return. Given the value of the Pokemon, this seems off.

Pokérus is a serious hazard these days, and you can never be too careful.

Anyway; I'm a totally kind-hearted trainer, and all of my Pokémon really respect me as a person. I'm the ""cool trainer"" who sets up co-ed sleepovers for his Pokémon at the daycare, and lets them experiment with poffins in a safe, supervised environment.

So, I'll just update this every few hours with a new one.

**EDIT:** Some friends are beginning to back out on what they want so I'll just keep giving them away. I'll put 'Final' up instead of the number for the last Pokemon I offer so people will know when to stop checking.

**EDIT:** Sorry about not continuing to update, but obviously reddit was not having it last night, so I just went to sleep. Granted it doesn't go down again, I'll keep going now (2:14 PM CST).

Leave a comment here and I will message you when I’m ready. If I don’t hear back within 5 minutes of responding to you, I will go to the next person.

PM me back your FC and Pokecheck login info with a temp password.

Move all the pokemon you want traded into 1 place so you know where they are before asking for Checks.

I don't care if you trade me back the same pokemon I gave you (unless I tell you). They are just extras for trading.

Stay in the room until we are done.

Oh not much, just a mere impossible-to-legally-obtain lvl 9 Reshiram/Zekrom! Why? Who knows....Anyways every now and then you find a good trade. Here’s some things I think people should know and consider when using the GTS. 

- Hacked pokemon CAN go on GTS. Always pokecheck rare stuff you get from there. If it looks shady, you’re probably better off leaving it there and coming here. 

- Don’t be afraid to change the country when searching, there are more countries that typically offer the pokemon you’re looking for than just Japan and U.S.A.

- Be quick: Oftentimes you’ll find a killer good deal like a Squirtle for a Tornadus. Make sure you know how to search your own boxes quickly to get that trade before it’s gone. (Helps to keep your boxes organized. 

- Coil/Magnemite: If you want to get more visitors to Join Avenue, just throw up a Magnemite for another one. You’ll usually get a trade within minutes.

3. I will meet you in the wifi room and we can trade. I will exit and you should **STAY IN THE ROOM**. Doing the checks only takes a minute, it's the trades that take forever... I don't want to waste time chasing you down to give you back your Pokemon.

I've got a treat for you! Many of you have seen my Mew trades before but I have worked hard to get you guys some more hard to get legendaries! 

Both Mews and Deoxys can be farmed more, so if you don't get it in this trade, just PM me! Mews can be made on my own, but Deoxys needs to be made with my friend (So i can only make more when HE is available)

I am looking for legit shinies cause I have achieved a legit full living dex.. and now my goal is a legit SHINY (as much as possible) living dex which proves to be quite the difficult task.

As the title implies, everything is free! I'm doing this giveaway as a token of gratitude for the excellent folk in this subreddit who have helped me so much with mah pogeymanz. I have seven different species of Pokemon, and fifteen of each species (well, thirty Scraggy). Italics indicate an egg move. Nicknaming and Pokerus are also free, but if you ask for one/both you can expect it to take a few minutes more. I'll be on tonight for an hour, maybe longer (11 PST?), and I have just about all day tomorrow.

**Kabuto**

* Many have an **Impish** nature (sorry, the best I could do)

I work at a video game store so any pokemon game we get in I check to see if anything good is there. Long story short, I have a box full of level 1 Rotoms and a few others. There is also:
a dragonite I can breed, few fossil pokemon, white exclusives.

And I can get starters from: Samurott, Charizard, Blastoise, Serperior, Torterra, Empoleon.

Mostly, I'm looking for people who would like these rotoms. :)

OH! Since I missed out on the easter egg trade, I'd L.O.V.E. to get some mystery eggs in return! My pokedex is rather empty looking. :x Please don't think the pokemon I've listed are the only ones I have! Don't hesitate to ask!

2) I report Circa: As mentioned, I reported Circa a while ago. I understand things fall threw the cracks, but I'm still kinda down about it. Don't blame yourselves mods, it was an honest mistake and you guys do a lot.

3) I really haven't touched Pokemon in like a while: Yeah, this one is a big one too. Ever since KH3 was announced, I've been playing DDD and plan on playing the PS2 games as well.
