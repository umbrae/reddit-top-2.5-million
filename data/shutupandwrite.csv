1354467037.0,224,self.shutupandwrite,145lhi,"""Write Drunk, Edit Sober"" and the myth of inspiration",253,29,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/145lhi/write_drunk_edit_sober_and_the_myth_of_inspiration/,"Everything that's wrong with the global writing community can be summarized in one word: *inspiration*.

What is inspiration? No one seems to know. But they do know what inspiration does. Inspiration makes you jot down ideas on napkins. Inspiration wakes you up at 3am and forces your hands on the keyboard. Inspiration makes you crazy, makes you work, makes you, somehow, into a writer.

The problem with inspiration is that it's a good story, and worse, a good story told to people who are predisposed to love a good story. There's something romantic, dramatic, *sexy* about pounding out a novella fueled only by caffeine and determination through endless sleep-deprived nights. There's hardly anything interesting at all about constructing a novel slowly, over the course of weeks, months, even years, and having small, quiet realizations about characters or scenes or the right place to put a word.

Inspiration is a story we want to come true, a story that we want to happen to us. And like any good story, it is, ultimately, fake.

For a while I've been wondering why Hemingway's quote, ""write drunk, edit sober"" has achieved the godlike status it has in so many writing communities. Today, I finally made the connection: like anything else, ""writing drunk"" is appealing because it invites us to change our mental state into something different.

And changing our mental state is where, according to legend, *inspiration* will happen.

It's a myth that won't die, helped along every time a well-known creative person admits to somehow altering their mental state, even if that alteration is completely unrelated to what they produce. We go through our daily lives, waiting for Inspiration to strike us at any moment, and eventually we have the realization that we're Doing It Wrong; inspiration doesn't lie in the mind of the sober! We must get drunk, get high, go 48 hours without sleeping, or some other quasi-religious ritual to get in touch with our inner creative self.

The reason for this, best I can tell, is that *we* don't want to be writers. We want some heretofore undiscovered part of ourselves, our Inner Writer, our Muse, our Creative Spirit, to be a writer, and for the rest of our conscious mind to reap the rewards.

And even if that were possible, would it be satisfying to know that some part of yourself that you don't associate with the rest of your identity is responsible for your success? Or maybe you're not happy with that identity, and you're hoping that some new part of yourself that's ""always been there"" is just going to pop out and take over. Good luck with that.

The point is, this kind of bullshit is mentally blocking. It makes us do stupid things, think stupid things. I'm a massive skeptic about writing and the creative process and even I've stayed up late with a blank Word document somehow expecting something to happen because I'm overtired, or buzzed, or what have you.

What's worse about this is that inspiration isn't fake, but in hoping that it will somehow leap to the forefront of our minds and take the wheel, we miss out on it. You have to actually *start* something for inspiration to happen. Inspiration is that moment when your mind recombines two or more ideas in a unique and meaningful way, and that can only happen if you are *already thinking*. And yes, you may think better during a certain time of day, or with certain music playing, or in a specific place, or whatever. But the point is that you aren't just sitting there waiting to be inspired during those times; you are already puzzling your way towards an idea when creativity happens.

The point is, *you* want to be a writer. Not some magical Idea Fairy that lives in your head, *you*. So start acting like it, and stop acting like there's some writerly part of you that needs unlocking first. Because while that may be a good story, I think actually managing to achieve your dreams, even if it's through things as humdrum as hard work and practice, is much more narratively satisfying.

1363010217.0,178,self.shutupandwrite,1a2xxl,Original Ideas Considered Harmful? (x-post by request),200,22,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1a2xxl/original_ideas_considered_harmful_xpost_by_request/,"Sorry to double-post, but it was mentioned to me that this subreddit may be a better place for long, thoughtful (I hope) articles like this one than that ""other"" sub, a proposition to which I readily agreed. Enjoy (or let me know why you didn't):

It's an oft-repeated maxim in writing that good ideas are overrated: a good writer can make a good book out of an awful idea, and conversely, a bad writer will take a great idea and usually turn it an awful book. A common story, first brought to my attention by Brandon Sanderson, tells the origin of Jim Butcher's [Codex Alera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alera) series. To quote Wikipedia:

*The inspiration for the series came from a bet Jim was challenged to by a member of the Delray Online Writer’s Workshop. The challenger bet that Jim could not write a good story based on a lame idea, and Jim countered that he could do it using two lame ideas of the challenger’s choosing. The “lame” ideas given were “Lost Roman Legion"", and “Pokémon”.*

The moral of the story, aside from ""don't make bets with Jim Butcher 'cuz he really takes that shit seriously,"" is: don't spend too much time worrying about whether your ideas are good or not, when you could be using that time to write (and thus becoming a better writer in the process).

There's a flaw in this story which I'll elaborate on later, but overall the utility of this advice is obvious. Just consider the structure of a typical novel: if the average novel contains 30 chapters, each of which contains 1-3 scenes (or more if you're feeling frisky), and each of these scenes requires at least a few ideas to make them interesting (to say nothing of the ideas needed for characters, the setting and the premise of the book as a whole), it's clear that a professional novelist absolutely must be able to generate a lot of ideas quickly to stay in business. Of course, we don't want to write books by always chaining together the first things that pop into our heads (at least, I assume we don't; who knows, I haven't tried it), but we can't afford to spend hours or days deciding what path to take on every little detail either. So for the most part, once we have the ""big picture"" laid down the way we like it, it's better to just take what your brain will give you and trust your writing skills to paper over any residual lameness that's left over.

Now, all of the above is pretty standard craft-talk, but it's a subject that's close to my heart, because I was a longtime sufferer of the ""is my idea good enough?"" syndrome. In my particular variant, I had an unhealthy, often subconscious aversion to any idea which I perceived as ""cliché"" or overdone. And I wasn't alone either: I can't count the number of times I've seen people post variants of ""how do I get past the feeling that everything has been done before?"" to various writing forums.

It's easy to understand where this feeling comes from; literature, if not society as a whole, places a high value on originality. How many times have you seen a critic quoted on a movie poster or book jacket describing a work as ""dazzlingly original"" (or ""brilliantly original"" or ""wonderfully original"" or some similar adverb)? Conversely, re-using ideas that have already been done is associated with plagiarism; do it too much, and you might be labeled a hack. Sure, maybe there's really no use in trying to be original since everything has been done before, but we don't want our books to be like everything else, do we? We want to be special, and if that means we have to try a little harder, then so be it.

It's a convincing fiction, and an easy trap to fall into, but for the rest of this article I'm going to make the best argument I can that the exact opposite of the above statement is true. Originality is not necessarily any better than being unoriginal, and in many cases may actually limit the potential audience for your work.

The basic tenet of my thesis is this: when consuming media, most humans are hard wired to desire familiarity first, and novelty only in small doses.

Rather than speculate on how this came to be (I have some ideas, but I'm not an evolutionary psychologist and this post is going to be long enough), I'll start with the example of my 3-year-old son, for whom we purchased a Netflix subscription a few months ago (ah Netflix, ultimate tool of the lazy parent). Right now, he's on a massive Spiderman kick--every time he sits down, it's Spiderman, Spiderman, Spiderman, which is fine since Netflix has approximately 10,000 Spiderman cartoon episodes available for streaming. Except, he doesn't want to watch 10,000 Spiderman cartoons; he wants to watch one cartoon, the first one he ever saw, where Spiderman fights the ice monsters. Over and over and over. It's a pattern he's engaged in ever since we started letting him watch TV: unless you demand that he watches something else, he will ask to watch the same thing again and again until some sort of threshold is reached and his brain switches and says I don't want to see this anymore, give me something new.

Of course, that might be typical for a toddler, but what about an adult? I'd argue that the degree to which this behavior changes as one enters adulthood is highly dependent on the individual. Some people will watch the same movie 200 times or read the same book every year for their entire life, while others are put off by anything that isn't very different from what they've seen before.

Personally, I'm probably in the upper quartile of novelty seekers; I hardly ever see movies twice and I never re-read books, which might account for some of the anxiety about originality mentioned above (and it would be interesting to see how many other creative-types feel the same way). However, my unscientific viewpoint is that the majority of humans actually fall closer to the familiarity-seeking side of the scale than the opposite. Just look at popular music: remember the [Four Chord Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I)? Those with a background in music theory know that this video isn't just a clever joke: most rock songs really are very structured very similarly, drawn from a small set of intervals that people are used to hearing, which in turn makes those intervals sound pleasing to western ears. Then there are genres where the differences are even more shallow, like the blues; there are blues fanatics who would gladly listen to blues every day, even when almost every song uses the same twelve bar progression or the same minor pentatonic scale!

In terms of print, the amount of novelty the average reader seeks also varies by genre. Some genres (i.e. Gothic romance) are so predictable they could almost be written by filling in character names on a Mad Lib. Literary fiction sits on the opposite end of the spectrum, because almost anything is acceptable as long as the prose has good ""style"" (which in itself is subjective). There are some forms of science fiction where the goal is to come up with completely new ideas, and others where the same concepts are recycled over and over (space opera, etc.). But for the most part, if you survey the most popular works from any given genre, you'll find that they borrow liberally from popular books that came before.

And here's the key point: *this is not a bad thing*. On one level, a genre is nothing more than a set of promises made to a reader: the reader goes to a particular shelf and selects a particular book cover *because they think they already know what's going to happen in that book*. Of course, you as the author want to surprise them, toss them a curveball once in a while the same way a good songwriter will sometimes change up and add an accidental or put in that iii chord before the V-IV-I turnaround. But if you examine the above-mentioned popular books, you'll see for yourself how light of a touch they tend to use with originality: they pick one, maybe two existing tropes and invert them, or inject one completely new concept, but leave the rest of their genre's conventions alone. And that's what *most* people crave: to have their hands held, then be shaken up just a bit before being gently placed back into their comfort zone.

And therein lies the flaw in the Codex Alera story: ""Lost Roman Legion"" crossed with ""Pokémon"" isn't a lame idea at all. It's actually an *awesome* idea, because *it re-uses two concepts that most people are already familiar with*. If you don't believe me, try pitching a book to an editor that doesn't have some obvious comparison to another book which readers are likely to know already. Or, try doing an elevator pitch for a complex, completely original story and watch an agent's eyes glaze over, then repeat the process by saying ""it's X meets Y!"" (example: Tale Spin in the Warring States Period) and observe the result.

So, if you're going to be anxious about something, be anxious that maybe your ideas are too original to sell, and you need to dial it back and start stealing more. Start with the Tale Spin thing. That one's free.

-W.W.

P.S. Please don't interpret this article as me encouraging people to defy their own artistic sensibilities for the sake of sales. If your ideas have rarely or never been done before and that's the book you want to write, then go for it. But you can still be aware of humanity's propensity for familiarity and use that to understand your audience: you're aiming for the experimental noise-rock listeners, not the people that listen to Justin Bieber. On one hand, there's a lot less of the former than the latter, but on the other, if you can find those core fans and really speak to what they crave, you may find yourself with a truly devoted fanbase. After all, there's so little out there for a true novelty-seeker to enjoy.",Discussion,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-discussion,,True,t3_1a2xxl,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1a2xxl/original_ideas_considered_harmful_xpost_by_request/,

Yes, some of the oldest and most cliched writing advice in the modern world. Why? **Because it's fucking true,** that's why. And new writers ignore it all the time. When you are describing one of your characters, try to imagine whether your prose reads like ambient description of setting and action, or if it reads like [Morgan Freeman doing a voiceover.] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJCuz3J8Y-w&amp;feature=relmfu) If it's the latter, you have a problem. 

**Ex.** Johnny was a jackass. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Johnny walked past the table of otakus and flipped over the lunch tray at the end with a casual air. He didn't even bother looking over his shoulder as his victim stared after him with mashed potatoes in her lap. **(YES)**

* **Dialogue tags.** One of the most useful and contentious tricks of writing fiction prose, and yet very few beginning writers know how to use these properly. In almost all cases, he said/she said are the only dialogue tags that your fiction needs (if any at all - if your characters are distinct enough, you don't even have to tag dialogue). Dialogue tags are not capitalized - they are an extension of the dialogue that comes before them. If you are continuing dialogue with a break in the middle for a dialogue tag, the previous piece of dialogue should be closed off by punctuation, usually a comma. 

**Ex.** ""How could you do this to me?!"" She sobbed. **(NO)**

**Ex.** ""This is the cruelest thing you have ever done,"" she said. ""And that's saying a lot."" She turned away from him. **(YES)**

* **It's vs. its.** The former is a contraction of ""it is"", the latter is a possessive. 

**Ex.** ""**It's** a boy.""

**Ex.** ""The dog played with **its** bone.""

* **You're vs. your.** Same issue. the former is a contraction of ""you are"", the latter is a possessive.

**Ex.** ""**You're** a coldblooded bastard,"" the writer said to the editor.

**Ex.** ""Hey, don't make the changes if you don't want to. It's **your** book,"" the editor replied. 

* **Names in dialogue.** 

**Example:** 

""Billy, why you be puttin' all those names in your dialogue?"" 

""I don't know Jim, I guess I just don't understand how natural dialogue works.""

Listen to the people speaking around you. People don't usually use the names of others while speaking to them unless they are a) very angry, or b) speaking to another person about someone. 

* **Mixed tense.** There are three major tenses used in writing: past, present, and future. Look them up, learn the difference. 

* **Mixed perspective.** There are two major perspectives utilized in writing: third person (either limited or omniscient), and first person. Second person perspective is also an option, but outside of the very select choose-your-own-adventure genre, second person perspective is generally frowned upon by many editors and is notoriously difficult to pull off. 

* **-ly ending adverbs.** The lazy writer's friend. If you feel the urge to write the following, you have not put enough emotion in the prose itself to depict these feelings: nervously, sadly, calmly, angrily, etc...

**Ex.** ""Quit using those goddamned -ly ending adverbs!"" Ronin said angrily. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Ronin held out a copy of *On Writing* as she stalked towards the fledgling writer. She brandished the book before the amateur's downward-cast eyes, admonishing him for piddling all over his work. *""No more -ly ending adverbs!""* **(YES)**

[props to ohgobwhatisthis for providing a much better example than I did]

* **Exposition dumps.** This is where the writer has a shit-ton of information that they need to convey to the reader, but instead of doing it through ambient dialogue, setting, and characterization, they decide to just lump it into a paragraph. See [Basil Exposition.] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJR1H5tf5wE&amp;list=PL3315B59A64D820AB&amp;feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_536151&amp;src_vid=E-PIidaqCyU)

* **Overuse of passive voice.** As opposed to active voice, which is dynamic and kickass, passive voice often comes across as boring and detaches the reader from the action at hand. Active voice is more forceful, especially when dealing with narrative action. Sometimes passive voice is necessary due to the context of the scene, but in many cases it can be eliminated for the active voice in order to bring more vibrancy to a piece of writing.  

**Ex.** The proposed initiative to limit passive voice was being bitterly opposed by some writers. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Some writers stood in bitter opposition against the initiative to limit passive voice.**(YES)**

* **Lack of conflict.** You have 2,500 words of a guy wanking internally to himself in an inner monologue that you find fascinating and the other 99% of humanity finds mind-numbingly tedious. The best source of internal conflict, which can be poignant if used well, is a strong source of external conflict.

**Ex.** Boring short story – Wife thinks about how dull her life has become. Does nothing about it, but we are forced to listen to how (internally) miserable she is. DULL. 

**Ex.** Cool short story – Wife is abused or neglected by her husband, and as a result makes the impromptu decision to take off in the night and fly to Cambodia. 

* **OVERUSE OF EXCLAMATION!!!!** No, I'm not trying to outlaw exclamation marks, or even all-caps dialogue. Both choices have their place in narrative fiction. But in many cases, an exclamation mark can be suitably removed in exchange for making the entire piece of dialogue stronger, and the all-caps YELLING dialogue can be replaced with the smoother, more stylish *italics.*

**Ex.** “OH MY GOD!” Christian exclaimed. “THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY FUCKING EXCLAMATION POINTS IN THIS STORY!! [LOUD NOISES!!!] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pdWAcK6Eh8)” **(NO)**

**Ex.** “Oh my God,” Christian said. “I can't believe that you can get emphasis across without exclamation  marks or all-caps dialogue. It's fucking *genius.”* **(YES)**

* **Semicolon abuse**. Somewhere, as we speak, someone is throwing in a semicolon between two sentence fragments because they think it looks cool. Just don't do it kids. Semicolons lead to indiscriminate dashes, and indiscriminate dashes lead to James Joyce. Given his notorious wordcount (or lack thereof) nobody wants that. So don't let it happen to you. Learn how to use irregular punctuation correctly. You have to master the rules before you can break them. 

* **Giving up because somebody said something mean about your writing.** Writing is a tough sport man. People always think of writers as these frilly guys (or gals) hanging out in coffee shops with their laptops and their fluffy cats, pulling awesome out of the ether. But the real truth is that writing is hard and having your work critiqued is even harder. It's like having someone tell you that your baby is ugly. Sometimes people say it with the best of intentions – sometimes people say it just to be an ass to you. The only difference between you and the mother of an ugly baby is that you actually have the chance to make your baby beautiful. So don't throw your baby in a dumpster just because someone said something mean about it that one time. Criticism happens. It's part of writing. It should *never* define your work.

* **Not starting at all**. Common excuses: I have too much homework, my dog ate my Macbook, it's four degrees shy of comfortable in here, I haven't finished my outline yet, I haven't finished worldbuilding yet, I'm not satisfied, I'm not ready, I can't do it. Suck it up and write. You're never going to be in perfect conditions. Your first drafts are always going to be shitty. Even Stephen King's first drafts are shitty. Just shut up and write. You can always fix it in post. 


So that's it. Keep these things in mind as you write, and your writing should improve in leaps and bounds.

Love,

The month of November is upon us. You may have heard tell of a certain event. An event national in scope. An event in which considerable quantities of writing are to be produced. Perhaps this is an event you would like to be a part of. But perhaps, for some of you, it is not.

But all is not lost. For those of us who have, for whatever reason, decided against participation in this national phenomenon, or even for those who are participants but want to make it something more than it already is, I present to you an alternative: get your shit together.

Not enough, you say? Fine. Let us make it a Month. Not a month - not some mere chunk of our planet's orbit - but a *Month*, a sacred window of time in which things happen.

And the name of this month shall be:

### National Get Your Shit Together Month.
----
#### The gist of GYST
Writing a novel in a month is all well and good, but let's get real here: it's a short term thing. Once the end of November hits, the magic is over and you're left with a less-than-amazing draft that needs editing. Lots of editing. Maybe you're the sort of person who doesn't mind that and will keep at it as the months wear on. Congratulations: you have your shit together.

Many of us do not, however. Get Your Shit Together Month is for those of us whose shit is slightly more spaced apart than we would prefer. GYST is about establishing long-term writing and editing habits that will serve you for all months of the year instead of just the one.

#### How to participate in GYST
Make a list of the shit in your life that is not together. Yes, *your entire life*. This may be a slightly painful list to make, but don't worry. The month ahead will be way more painful.

Why a list of everything in your life? Because writing isn't something that occurs outside of life. Yes, we may use it to escape, and yes, we may have our creative oases far apart from everything else. But really, all that stuff is an illusion. We're still very much *alive* when we're writing (for some of us, it may be the time we are *most* alive, which is a really good indication of shit not being together). So, paradoxically, writing may not be the primary focus of everyone's GYST experience. But that's because, in order to write regularly, your shit must first be at least somewhat together.

By the end of the month, all the stuff on that list should be in one of three states:

1. Fixed.
2. A plan has been made to fix it, or to get closer to fixing it. (This will probably be most of your stuff.)
3. Nothing more can be done at this time.

If you have confronted everything on that list, congratulations! You have ""won"" GYST.

#### The shared goal
One thing that should be on everyone's list is to establish a writing routine. That is the end goal here: to develop good writing habits. However, do not, do **not** overemphasize this for yourself. Once you've made that list, make as accurate of an assessment as you can about the togetherness of your shit. Maybe you can start working on writing today; maybe you won't be able to even *think* about writing for the next few weeks. Do what you have to do.

To that end, GYST Month is very open-ended. The end goal is to write more, and write more regularly, than you did coming into it. That's it. You don't have an explicit writing goal this month, but you do have to make sure you are *more capable* of producing writing than you were before.

If you're interested in participating, sign up here. Obviously your lists are likely to be private and personal, so you're responsible for holding yourself to those goals.",Meta,False,,t5_2u32d,1351747841.0,tag-meta,,True,t3_12fzhi,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/12fzhi/get_your_shit_together_month_starts_today_heres/,

Like most writers, I have a desk. It has a snake-neck lamp, unplugged and never lit. It has a wireless printer still in the box. It has a pack of unopened printer paper, never used. It has a warm forgotten beer, never opened.

I would take a picture of these things, but none of them has anything to do with writing. They are the physical manifestation of everything that writing is not. I have never written at this desk, it is not my place for that. But I have written many things.

**The first rule of Write Club is that no one gives a shit about your desk.** Your desk has nothing to do with your writing. Hemingway wrote in cafes. Stephen King started out at a child's desk that he could barely fit his gangly knees under. Grisham wrote on the subway on steno pads. Chee writes on trains in sleeper cars. Capote wrote in bed. Thomas Clayton Wolfe wrote on the top of a refrigerator. 

Try finding pictures of this. With the exception of Capote (that flamboyant bastard) you won't. That's because these people were too busy writing to have their pictures taken. 

**The second rule of Write Club is that you don't spend more time talking about writing than you spend writing.** Of course writers are going to talk about writing, it's inevitable. It's such a lonely job, we are all just solitary creatures of expression howling for some form of validation. But every minute you spend talking about writing is a minute you are spending not writing. And some day - maybe today, maybe one day soon, maybe years from now - you are going to die.  So now is the moment you ask: do you want to be remembered as someone who talked about his unfinished novel a lot, or do you want to be remembered as a writer?

**The third rule of Write Club is that if you stop, go limp, tap out, and/or give up, based on criticism or laziness or the general inability to effectively manage your lifespan, the writing is over.** You can call yourself a writer if you sit around talking about notes and outlines and drinking and reading and musing, but writers do one thing: write. All the time. Short stories. Screenplays. Blogs. Articles. Stageplays. Novels. Writing prompts. Novellas. Books. No matter how shitty your writing is, if you are writing, then you are a writer. If you are not writing, then you are not. 

**The fourth rule of Write Club is that there are only two guys to a story: you against yourself.**

**The fifth rule of Write Club: one story at a time.** Finish it, beat it into submission or have your ass kicked by it, but do not start another story until your story is done. 

**Sixth rule of Write Club: Your tools don't matter.** Pens, pencils, typewriters, cats, writing books, influential novels, highlighters, napkins, index cards, binders, notebooks, Macbooks, laptops, desktops, iPads, iPhones, none of it is worth a flying blue fuck if you're not actively writing on it.

Their plot ideas feel overused and they want to mix it up a bit. Perhaps they’re worried about stepping on a published author’s toes by writing a story that seems too close to one that author has released.

What a load of garbage.

A long time ago, on a drive with my father, we started talking about creativity. Since creation and consumption of art in various forms is important to my father, he had a lot to say on the subject. The one thing he said that sticks out more than anything else is this: There are no original plots. There haven’t been any for a very long time. The fact is that there’s a limited amount of things somebody can even *do* if what they are going to do is worth making a story of it.

I wanted to disagree. It was so discouraging, somehow. It meant nobody could really be creative again. Nothing new would ever be made. That could not be possible, because it just couldn’t.

Being a contrary child, I set out to prove him wrong by writing a totally new plot. For the longest time, that meant I churned out page after page of the most boring crap imaginable. I look back on my writing and just cringe. Every criticism I received said largely the same thing: ""You obviously know the language, you can put together your thoughts fairly coherently, but *what is the point?*"" In trying to create an original plot, I wound up not telling any stories at all.

**So, Tenspeed, what *is* the point, then?**

The point, when you really think about it, is that the fact that every plot has been done, far from limiting your creativity, **truly sets you free.** An interesting plot can certainly drive a story, but plot is ultimately unreliable when it comes to engaging readers. Everyone has a different preference, plots they prefer over others. On the other hand, settings are as complex and mysterious as the writer’s imagination will allow. The pacing and tone of the story are entirely yours to command. Characters are as many and varied as the people or things that inspire them. While your protagonist may walk a path walked by thousands or millions before them, they are still a unique personality, and they will not solve their problems in exactly the same way as any of those who came before.

I use the analogy of food frequently when I discuss this subject because I cooked professionally until health forced me out of it, and I still enjoy it a great deal at home. In cooking, there are really only so many ingredients you can use. While we have access, through global trade, to a truly unprecedented variety of ingredients, the amount is still limited to what already exists. But the point of cooking isn’t to provide all new ingredients. The point is to use existing ingredients in such a way that you make something that, if it isn’t entirely original, is nonetheless innovative or otherwise inspired.

That’s what writing is, as well. We use existing ingredients to create new masterpieces. There is nothing new under the sun, but that doesn’t mean we can’t redesign the old in a new and exciting way.

**TL;DR: There are no new plots, but that’s okay because your plot is the least of your worries. Write the story you want to write, worry about making the story, characters, and setting engaging, and the lack of original plot won’t matter at all.**

Some of this advice is probably geared more toward novices.

* An easy way to narrow down details/help develop a character is to pick a primary sense through which they experience the world.

* There’s probably a time of day that’s your golden hour in terms of writing. If you can, figure out what it is and write during that time.

* It can be awkward when you’re first writing to talk about stories (yours and other’s) in terms of: character, conflict, dialogue, sensory details, objects, plot, and language. Using this type of vocabulary allows you pull apart your text and analyze what’s working, and what isn’t. Sometimes things will run together (character and dialogue) and that’s okay, it’s still useful to think about stories in these terms.

* I’ve run into the terms “pantsers” and “plotters” before. “Putter-inner” and “taker-outer” were new ones to me. If you are a pantser, you may want to consider just sticking annotations into the text that something (a description, a scene) goes here when you’re not sure, or write a kind of scaffold to build on. I wrote a vague story, fleshed it out with some sensory details, then added more to characters after I got a critique from the group. 

* Use the an external detail (like the light on someone’s face) to move into internal space (how they feel about the person).

* Don’t use phrases like, “He had a bone-chilling smile,” but try and chill the reader to the bones using sensory details.",Craft,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-craft,,True,t3_14pdlp,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/14pdlp/quick_and_dirty_trick_from_my_erotica_class_sfw/,

So according to some Gregorian calendar system or whatever, tomorrow begins a new year. This is every bit as relevant to your productivity as the Mayan calendar was to the end of the world.

However, despite this arbitrary system having approximately zero influence on your life at all, you may feel tempted by some cultural ideals surrounding this shift from December to January to make yourself an ambitious writing goal. That is all well and good and fine, but nobody cares, for two reasons:

* New Year's resolutions are generally bullshit. It's difficult to summarize all of human motivation or lack thereof in a sentence, but the conventional wisdom is, if you *really* wanted change, you would have done it by now instead of waiting for some arbitrary orbital completion of celestial bodies.
* There is only one place in this subreddit for people who talk about what they're going to do, and that is the weekly checkin thread, and you are expected to actually get stuff done in time for next week. This is far more effective at causing guilt than a year-long goal that you have approximately 365 days to talk yourself out of.

So if you feel you absolutely *must* mention your utterly crap goal, do it on [this week's checkin thread](http://redd.it/15q39z). You could also have a less utterly crap goal, as well, one that you can start putting into practice, dare I say it, this very week.

It was fantastic. Everything was going to fit perfectly together and would flow with mellifluous ease. You knew exactly what you wanted to do with the story, the way it would impact the reader, would make him see the world in a new and peculiar way. Or maybe not quite yet, but you had a strong enough idea that there was no way it wouldn't work. 

Now you're stuck knee-deep, toiling away at a story whose usefulness you begin to doubt every time you even think about working on it. It has gotten to be such a mess that you can't even grasp it as a whole anymore. That initial inspiration, your whole reason for beginning the piece, has either changed or is muddled to the point where it hardly even matters anymore. And the stuff that has come out is shit. The characters aren't fleshed out enough. This chapter doesn't lead into that chapter in the way you want it to. Every time you write something that you think sounds great, you reread it only to discover that it sounds like you're trying way too hard. And all that besides, the plot that you thought was so cool? It's boring. You've thought about it so much that you can't possibly imagine what you saw in it at first.

Somehow you've gotten this far. But is it worth it to keep pushing? What's the point? Shouldn't you just start afresh? Cut your losses and start something new, using the experience you've gained from this failure? After all, there's this cool new idea that you have... maybe it would work better...

**NO.**

Now, and this is just, like, my opinion, man, but I'm a very firm proponent to doing everything you can to finish each story you start. I want to explain why, and how. It's easier than you think. Really, it is. No, I know, I know how hard it is, how fucking painful every fucking word can be, how easy it is to feel stuck in a Vietnam War-like scenario, but trust me. Or at least hear me out.

I used to hop from one story to the next. Didn't finish anything, didn't think it was worth it. Thought I was developing too rapidly, that my skills were improving to the point where I was leaving my old stories in the dust. But after months and years, I realized that, like [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/u5n4x/i_just_want_to_tell_a_good_story_is_that_too_much/), I had nothing to show for it but broken fragments of stories, unfleshed-out ideas, half-formed characters, etc. So I decided, one day, that I would start a new story (hah) but THIS TIME I would push myself and finish it, not matter how shit it was.

And guess what? It was shit.

But, guess what else? I finished, and it felt *great*. From then on, I was hooked.

Finishing a story is hard. Sometimes it's easy, sure; sometimes you're in the zone and it all just comes out. Splat. But don't count on that if you want to actually make something worthwhile. Nine times out of ten, it's hard. And sometimes it can be more mentally demanding than anything a lot of us have ever dealt with in our lives, particularly if you're smart and sailed through school without really having to push yourself to the limit. You feel like you've lost the thread, like there's no hope for anything, like a failure. Those feelings are not something you would normally volunteer to deal with. So it's easier to just cut your losses and start afresh. Feels good. But those bad feelings are precisely the ones that you will **and should** have to go through one way or the other if you want to finish anything worthwhile. 

Listen. Not everything you write is going to work. A lot of it won't. A lot of it should just remain hidden in the recesses of your harddrive and should never be shown to anybody under any circumstances. And guess what? That's **fine.** It sucks, it's really fucking hard to come to terms with, but it's fine. You *have* to fail repeatedly if you want to succeed. And each failure is a step in the right direction. 

But if you don't finish your story, how will you **know** it's a failure? How will you know why it failed? How will you know where in the story the failure happened? And how will you know it cannot possibly be salvaged? 

That initial inspiration came from somewhere. It's an itch that you need to scratch. So just keep scratching at it until you find the best way to scratch it. 

You can always edit. Always. You can take a story you wrote ten years ago and edit it. Come up with a new ending, a new intro, whatever. You can rework it, you can steal bits and pieces from it and make something new. But you need to have something there to work with. 

What's more, no matter how shitty your current story is, writing it will give you experience, so that your next story, which you can start AFTER YOU FINISH THIS ONE, will be that much better.

So keep going. All those doubts, fears, insecurities; don't let them stop you. Yeah, you suck, you're a shit writer, you don't know how to put words together, your sentences sound like they've been dragged along the highway for three hundred miles, your characters are idiots and they're not doing what they're supposed to, the reader will never get it, etc.

Don't listen. Just keep going, one word after the other, one sentence after the other, one page after the other, one chapter after the other, one story after the other, one book after the other. Story isn't working? Skip ahead a bit if you need to. Edit your earlier chapters. Delete, as I once did, 16,000 words and reroute the entire path of the story if you need to. Set a daily word limit, a daily time limit, and mark on your calendar for each day you've done that until you have a nice long uninterrupted line. But keep going. You'll make it out alive.

Addendum: Okay, yes, I know, some stories really just don't work and they're never going to and you were an idiot for even thinking they would. If you really really really want to abandon something, go ahead. But at LEAST put SOME kind of ending in there, even if it's as stupid as ""Then a meteorite came and blew them to smithereens. FUCK YEAH."" It'll give you some sense of closure and I really do think will help you move on with your life. Just... don't publish it.

Be a writer.,41,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/xi75h/think_like_a_writer_act_like_a_writer_be_a_writer/,"Writers like to pretend. That's the essence of writing: playing and pretending like a child does.

So let's pretend for a second.

Pretend that you've written dozens of books and are a career writer. You've made it. No more struggling or anything. You *are* a writer, not an amateur, not a wannabe, not trying to be a writer. *You are*.

I find that this mindset helps boost my confidence when I'm writing. At the risk of sounding like a broken record or a horrible fanboy, John Cleese talks about confidence - the confidence to play, to do this, to do that, without the fear of making a mistake. This is how children play and explore, and this is the mindset you must find.

What I'm proposing is an extension of the confidence idea. When you sit down to brainstorm or develop your first draft, give yourself confidence by *pretending* that you're an accomplished writer, and that you know what you're doing.

**You know what you're doing.**

If you truly believe that you're a writer, and that you know what you're doing, you'll question and doubt a lot less. This is important, especially when working on your first draft. Give yourself the freedom to explore, to try new things, to make a mistake. Nobody's going to fault you or laugh at you.

When it comes time to edit, though, drop the confidence mask and pick up the critic mask. Now it's time to constructively criticize everything you accomplished.

So, now you're a writer. Go write.

EDIT: added a few things to clarify that I'm talking about when brainstorming/drafting only.

Why on earth would anyone call “Show, Don’t Tell” a lazy piece of advice? Probably because that’s what it is. SDT is a staple remark that many critics use, the more experienced ones probably knowing what they’re talking about, while others just repeat it because they were told the same thing with their own works. The principle itself is valid, it is sometimes better to *show* something to your reader, than to simply state that it is. However, it is a particularly lazy piece of advice because that’s usually all people say about the matter. There is no example, there is no reasoning, just a simple repetition of the same tired line.

As came up a lot in my [How To Swallow Criticism When You're Told You Suck](http://redd.it/13etgh) thread, there are good ways and bad ways to give advice. More than once it was said that vague advice or critiques were not helpful, because you don’t know for sure what they mean. I entirely agree with that, in most cases, but sometimes there are things you need to put together yourself. That being said, a ‘general practice’ rule that so many swear by doesn’t fall into the latter category of self-definition. 

The biggest bone I have to pick with advice like SDT is the fact that it doesn’t actually show or tell you much of anything as a stand alone piece of advice. The heart of your problem may be that you aren’t showing as much as you’re telling, but unless you know *where* that occurs, or what the preferred ratio is, it doesn’t push you one lick further, especially if you’re new to writing and getting it over and over again (which seems to be the case a lot of the time).

A fellow writer of mine got the advice that they needed to show and not tell. They let me read over their story, and it was by far the most descriptive piece I’d ever written—And that was by far the worst thing that I’d ever seen. This writer took SDT to heart for *every* bit of their story, which is what one would assume you should do if that’s what everyone says, and went as far as to have an entire scene dedicated to how one character built their sandwich. The problem with this is that nobody is actually going to read anything that is fully just descriptions of everything in excruciating detail. It detracts from the things that actually need to be described, because the whole story turns in to a Shakespearian hoj poj of lengthy descriptions.

It is not impossible to turn ‘Show, Don’t Tell’ into a more constructive piece of advice. There are many people who have tried to explain it in more usable terms. Jerz’s Literary Blog features a post called [*Show, Don’t (Just) Tell*](http://jerz.setonhill.edu/writing/creative1/showing/) and shows specific examples of how and when showing and telling should be done. One quote that he references, as a good time to tell instead of show, being Darth Vader’s famous line, “I am your father”. Many people have forgotten that simply saying the shortest and simplest form of something doesn’t always make it the best way to say it. Grammar Girl also has an engaging article on the subject, along with a host of other blogs and posts from around the internet. If it is really this easy to expand on, why do people refuse to do it in their regular dealings with critiques?

I say the same reason we still hear things like `Never do xyz` and `Always do abc`, and of course those tidbits like `Write Drunk, Edit Sober`. These critiques are usually more lazy than the writing they are being applied to, because they are over generalized, widely unsupported with examples to the particular work, and do not apply to *every* situation, though the persons saying it would have you believe they do. Everything needs a balance of sorts, and these lazy, vague pieces of advice rarely address what that balance is. I wouldn’t expect a piece of historical non-fiction to detail everything in all sorts of details all the time, there needs to be some solid telling; just as I wouldn’t expect for a romance to skip clichés, because sometimes that’s what makes it a fun read. These ‘writer rules’ are more like guidelines that only apply *some* of the time for most of the work. The sooner people begin to realize that sticking to these mantras of old for the sake of tradition is not actually as good as using things that are actually helpful, the better off writers will be.",Critique,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-critique,,True,t3_14i4te,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/14i4te/show_dont_tell_and_other_lazy_advice/,

As I want to talk not just about the progress of my books but also the process of writing them, finishing the first draft seems like an apt time to talk about them in general.

To me the most important role of first drafts is this:

**They tell you what is wrong with your story.**

This is awesome. Actually it's not awesome, it's **amazing**, but it can only be done once you've got a completed first draft in front of you.
I work from an outline, which has about four or five bullet points for each chapter/section outlining what should happen in each. But it cannot tell me whether the story works, or if the characters are right, or if the pacing is all over the place (it is). You can only judge that once you have a whole story in front of you.

Sure you can spend ages on each chapter in your first draft, making the grammar and prose amazing as you go along, but to me that is wasted time. At that point you don't know how much you will need to change so focusing on those issues is just wasting time. Get that first draft finished and you will have an overview of the whole story and a much better idea of what you need to do going forward.

Remember that story is everything with a book, get that nailed down first you can worry about the details later. It's no good having wonderful prose if the story is rubbish, or moves as fast as dried cement.

**They help find your characters voices.**

Sometimes characters jump full formed into your mind, complete with how they speak and act. The rest of the time that will evolve as your write each draft and put them into situations they have to react to. A first draft that focus on dialogue and story can help build those distinctive voices you want because you have time writing them and getting a clearer picture of who they are in your head.

Having your characters worked out also feeds back into your story, as your characters evolve you may find the story you had planned no longer works with the personalities you have now given them. 

This is great. 

Embrace this and change the story as needed to fit them because it will make both stronger. You will have a story that moves with characters and characters actions that fit with the personality you have given them.

So coming to the second draft you will hopefully have a much better picture of the characters you are writing and be able to feed that into it, and also make your story longer as a result.

**They let you suck.**

This may be more important than either of the two points above. First drafts will be bad, they are for almost every single writer live today and who has ever lived. Sure they be some exceptions but they're the special cases. For most terrible, cringe-worthy and clichéd first drafts are part of the process of every book they write. It is them getting ideas down, getting a story finished and then making it better.
I often see budding writers on the internet saying how worried they are that what they are writing is bad, or sucks, or isn't worth continuing with. Ignore that voice, kick it into the back of the closet in your mind and lock it away. Take your chance to just write what you want (though don't go insane, remember the story you are meant to be telling), and get it done. 

Be proud that you have finished something, and that is important, but remember you then have to make it good. First drafts may be a chance to get the story down and see what needs changing but things **wil** need changing. First drafts should be for your eyes, and maybe a few trusted people whose advice you value, and **no one else's!**

You still have to make it good. 

So go and finish your first drafts, embrace their bad stories, learn from them, and then get on with finishing the book to the absolute best of your abilities.

Going back to one fundamental in story-telling,34,7,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/13t8zu/no_plot_yes_problem_going_back_to_one_fundamental/,"As we reach the final few days of National Novel Writing Month, I thought it might be noteworthy to address one of the biggest differences between the idea behind this writing subreddit and the biggest mass-writing event of the year. 

To the standard observer, it *seems* like the only difference is that Shut Up &amp; Write is the same thing as Nanowrimo, but it happens all year. We're dedicated enough to stick it out, push past just the initial month burst. But I think the differences are bigger than that: Nanowrimo is almost about empowering yourself, to give yourself the confidence that you *can* write a novel, and it technically only takes a month. SU&amp;W lives in reality: we want to produce good writing - something good enough to publish - and realistically, that takes more than a month of glorified free-writing. 

Don't get me wrong. I actually think Nanowrimo is a great idea. There are many people out there who just think they can't do it, and the month long event is a wonderful way to just get people to shut up and write, effectively de-mystifying the whole process of writing. This is something SU&amp;W fully supports.

However, Chris Baty, the founder of Nanowrimo, wrote the book [*No Plot? No Problem! The Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days*](http://www.amazon.com/No-Plot-Problem-Low-Stress-High-Velocity/dp/0811845052), and while it address the goal of Nanowrimo, it does *not* aid in the endeavor to write a good first draft of a book.

Why? Because having no plot *is* a problem! There is no story if there is no plot.  And if someone participating in Nanowrimo wanted to actually use their book for something other than a feel-good accomplishment, then without a story, their efforts were wasted.

I'm not sitting here saying that everyone who does Nanowrimo doesn't have plot. I'm sure there are many who do.  In fact, having a plot would really aid the endeavor to write 50k words because stuff is actually happening that people can write about.

You may be wondering what I mean by plot. I'm not particularly scriptive when it comes to the details. I personally love to experiment with structure. There are many places to find more information on plot. [This article](http://suite101.com/article/the-five-basic-elements-of-plot-structure-explained-a262022) explains the basic plot structure of any story, [this article](http://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/plot-outline.html) is some sort of attempt on how to write plot, and [this SU&amp;W post](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/uqfce/from_short_story_to_novel/) outlines ways to stretch a short story out until a novel. You can buy/find books on structure that will help you with the details if you're really having problems. [Book 1](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0898799058?tag=theevepeosgui-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0898799058&amp;adid=06J1WGAE6HSNNNVP2M52&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.musik-therapie.at%2FPederHill%2FStructure%26Plot.htm), [Book 2](http://www.amazon.com/dp/158297294X?tag=theevepeosgui-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=158297294X&amp;adid=1AR15XN7H4WC5WEB58F0&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.musik-therapie.at%2FPederHill%2FStructure%26Plot.htm), and [Book 3](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1582973253?tag=theevepeosgui-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=1582973253&amp;adid=1AT0VHQYX57HT0W258P1&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.musik-therapie.at%2FPederHill%2FStructure%26Plot.htm)  

What I would like to stress about all this seemingly complicated talk about plot and structure is having a *conflict* and having it *early on*.  There are ways to expand the exposition in interesting ways (i.e. mini conflicts), but in general, the story will be much easier to write when you thrust the major problem on the character right away and make the problem difficult to solve.  The story is essentially over once the conflict is resolved, so extending the resolution is also a bad idea. The whole middle part? Filled with *obstacles* in achieving the conflict.  

Once you have a conflict, obstacles, and a resolution (of sorts), then you have plot. It's not as hard as it sounds, but it's the most basic and necessary part to story-telling there is.

To clarify, I'm not saying that a good story is all about the plot ([Martin Scorcese is all about da characters, not the plot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrkHyvl5NeI&amp;feature=related)), but rather plot is just a fundamental you need to *have* a story. Just ask [Steven Spielberg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpevTh7Ve9A&amp;feature=fvwrel).

**TL;DR: You need conflict to write a story.**

*Edit*: There has been a lot of discussion about the definition of ""plot"".  I apologize for not making this clearer.  Plot, traditionally, is just the events that happen in a novel. I'm referring to plot structure, not this definition.  Please refer to [the Wikipedia page on narrative plot](http://tinyurl.com/yfa8hsm). Aristotle felt that plot was a beginning, middle and end, and Freytag was the guy who went specifically into the whole inciting incident, rising action, climax, falling action, etc. I sort of simplified the basic plot structure of ""conflict, middle (character obstacles), and resolution,"" because I think there are all sorts of ways to structure things. I do believe that we need to have those three elements.  However, this topic has caused an interesting discussion about novel structure being more episodic instead of having an entire overarching plot.  Do you think this is a good way of structuring a novel? Do you have any good examples of it? I could be totally wrong!!

When referring to Chris Baty's book, I have read it, and I enjoyed it. I thought it was a good way to approach novel writing for those who are too scared to do it. There are many people who argue Nanowrimo, but please note that I am not one of them. My whole point with the plot structure is that some people get to the end of the month and can't actually do anything with their book because it has no... intrigue and suspense. In a way, conflict creates the traditional idea of plot.  I'm also not stressing planning versus ""pantsing"" as some people have suggested. You can invent conflict on the fly. It just needs to be there.

So when we go back to his book ""No Plot? No problem!"" I'm only referring to plot structure period.  Baty is referring to the fact that you don't need to preplan every event in your book before you write it. I actually agree with this, and I apologize for wording my post in a way that completely misconstrued both what he meant and what I meant.",Structure,False,,t5_2u32d,1353974182.0,tag-structure,,True,t3_13t8zu,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/13t8zu/no_plot_yes_problem_going_back_to_one_fundamental/,

These elements have been parroted on the various writing and reading subreddits over and over, but usually as parts of long, confusing posts that require effort to sift through and collate into something useful.

Here is the product of that effort. SU&amp;W, I present to you the [Story Pillars Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XEwlwYb48m1PoyfGSXRsvXZnKDoBsM1Hogfmi6CDz8U/edit). Allow me to explain how it works. 

The above link will send you to a GDrive document with 27 key touch points that will make a well-defined story. The writer goes through each touch point and answers each question. These 27 points are what makes a story *yours* and no one elses. When you define all of these parameters, everything else is style and dressing. Some of these questions, such as 'Does the protagonist have a goal?', maybe be answered more than once- maybe she has three goals. Whether the answer is yes or no, or how many, doesn't matter. All that matters is you've answered them and thus, defined your story.

What does matter is that there is a reasonable answer. If you answer any of these touch points with ""I don't know"", your piece isn't ready yet. If you ask for help on defining any of these touch points, you're no longer writing your own story. I know this is not that relevant in this sub (thank goodness), but to those who do try to crowdsource Reddit with these basic Pillar questions- **STOP**. Once you get someone else answering these questions for you, the story stops being yours. Take responsibility and credit for your ideas!

This is only the first iteration, so any suggestions for further pillars to add are welcome. Hopefully this can help those of you struggling with your own works, or provide a handy guideline to outline your next piece.

Since the info on how to choose keywords online is somewhat fragmented/incomplete/not targeted toward authors, I thought I'd put together a little to what I did, so that others can benefit or tell me what they think I'm doing wrong.

Just to make it clear: I don't claim any proven results from this method. The below is just what I chose to do based on some logical inferences, using the best tools I can find. All feedback is welcomed.

**What is an Amazon Keyword?**

When you publish a book on [KDP](https://kdp.amazon.com), Amazon lets you specify two categories and seven keywords to help readers find your book. Keywords can be a single word or more than one (called a ""phrase""). These keywords are used when a user searches amazon--to oversimplify a bit, if a keyword in the user's search matches one of your book's keywords (or your title), your book will appear in the search results. There are three main criteria for what constitutes a ""good"" keyword:

1. Volume: How often is a keyword searched for? If no one is looking for books with a particular keyword, it won't do you any good to use it.
2. Competition: How many other books use the same keyword, and will they be ranked above you in searches? Of particular importance is whether your book will show up in the first page of results, since this will exponentially increase how many people see it.
3. Relevance: Is your book going to appeal to people who are searching for this keyword? It's nice to appear in the #1 position in a search for romance novels, but if your book is a gritty post-apocalyptic space marine bloodfest, you're probably not going to see much revenues from it.

**Aside: Categories**

Choices of categories and keywords are intrinsically linked with each other, as the below content will make clear. I would encourage anyone reading this guide to also read Michael J. Sullivan's [category guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Write2Publish/comments/1aqm7v/making_the_most_of_your_amazon_categories/), and make sure you take the time to really understand it. You will notice he mentions that some categories are ""easier"" than others, i.e. your book doesn't need to be ranked as high in them to appear in a bestseller list. One thing to keep in mind is that this concept is only useful if your book is already selling well; in other words, lets say I have two categories available:

* Category A's #10 book is ranked 3,000 and my book fits into it really well
* Category B's #10 book is ranked 50,000 and my book isn't a perfect fit for it.

If my book is ranked above 50,000, then B may be the better choice, because it will show up when readers browse the bestseller list for that category. However, unless you already have an established audience, odds are when you first start out your books will start ranked somewhere around 800k or higher. In this case, category A is a better choice, because then people who find your book via keyword search in that category will find your work more relevant, and you aren't going to show up in the top 10 for either category anyway. Once you've done the legwork and sold enough copies of your book to rise above the 50k mark, you can always go back and change the category to take advantage of your new status.

So, go ahead and browse Amazon and choose two categories for your book before continuing on with this guide.

**Step 1: Brainstorm**

Create a new spreadsheet, and in the first column, start entering all the keywords and phrases you can think of to describe your book. To begin with, remember what makes your book special; the elements you thought of that made you want to write it in the first place. Write a synopsis, and go through it chapter by chapter looking for ideas. Mine settings, characters and plot devices. The trick here is not to worry yet whether a keyword is good or bad--this will only slow you down. The next two steps will take care of whittling down the list, so just let ideas flow out of your brain unimpeded for now. Some tips on keywords:

* As mentioned above, any word in your book title automatically becomes a keyword, without counting against the seven allotted to you by Amazon. This is why you often see books with titles like ""The Arwen Chronicles - Urban Fantasy Romance."" This is a clever trick to expand your keyword count, although perhaps it makes your listing look a little cheesy.
* Conversely, your book description is *not* used in keyword searches, so any exciting elements from your description need to be captured separately in a keyword.
* Don't be afraid to consider common two or three (or more?) word phrases. These so-called ""long tail"" keywords are often under-utilized.
* Make sure you consider variant spellings and different ways of saying the same thing (werewolf, werewolves, wolves, wolfkin, lycanthrope, etc.), though Google will help with this (see step 2). 
* Generic keywords like ""fantasy"" are generally useless because there is too much competition, but if in doubt, just include it; if a keyword is too generic then it will be weeded out in step 3.

**Step 2: Look up Volume**

The 100,000 pound gorilla of the keyword research game is undoubtedly the [Google Adwords Keyword Lookup Tool](https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__c=1000000000&amp;__u=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS). This handy tool is meant to evaluate and suggest keywords for Adwords campaigns, but it's enormously useful to see estimated volumes for Amazon keywords as well. Note the word ""estimated,"" here; we're making somewhat of a leap in faith that the number of people searching for a keyword on google is approximately proportionate to that same keyword on Amazon. Whether or not this generally holds true in real life is debatable, but since the Adwords data is the best we have, we'll go ahead and use it anyway, secure in the knowledge that at least we're not just leaving things to blind chance.

So here's what to do:

1. In the ""Word or phrase"" box, copy and paste your keywords/phrases, one per line.
2. Leave ""Website"" blank. Set ""Category"" to ""Books &amp; Literature"" to improve the quality of keyword suggestions.
3. Click Search.

You'll be given two tables of data; the first contains the monthly search volumes for your keywords, and the second contains additional keyword suggestions, again with volume data. Most of the suggestions will be crap, but sometimes you'll find some good ones in there. Ignore the ""Competition"" column, it tells you how many people are bidding on an Adwords keyword and is of no use to you. That leaves two more columns of data: Global Monthly Searches and Local Monthly Searches. The ""local"" column means searches only from your selected region (the USA by default). I tend to use the global data instead since people buy Amazon books from all of the world, but to each his own. Whichever you choose, copy the numbers from that column into your spreadsheet, along with any additional keywords you want to use.

**Step 3: Look up Competition**

Sort your spreadsheet by volume number, descending. Again, don't take the actual numbers here too seriously. For our purposes, they're essentially fictitious, except for their values *relative* to each other. So, if one keyword has a volume of 42,000, and another has 46,000, you may as well just consider them equal. But if another has a volume of 460,000, that's perhaps reason to consider it as a better option.

Now comes the tedious part. This process could be automated using the Amazon APIs, but from my reading, doing so would violate their ToS, so I'll just continue as if we're doing this by hand:

1. Open amazon.com and in the dropdown next to the seach box, select ""Kindle Store.""
2. Enter your first keyword and search.
3. On the search results page, change ""Sort by"" from ""Relevance"" to ""New and Popular"" (note, this is probably not indicative of what an average reader will do, but it is more conducive to estimating how popular your book needs to be for a given keyword. As your Amazon rank rises, so will your position in the ""Relevance"" search as well (I assume), just not in as predictable a manner).
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and open the last book listed on the first page of results in a new window.
5. Scroll to or search for ""Amazon Best Sellers Rank."" It will say something like ""#XXXX Paid in Kindle Store."" That is the rank you need to beat to come up on the first page of global results. Note it in your spreadsheet in a new column. If you like, you can also note the number of results of the search (at the top of the result page), but this number is not nearly as important; if a search only returns 300 results, it's still not much good to you if they are the 300 most popular books on Amazon!
6. Back on the result page, under ""Departments"" on the left hand side, find your book's first category and click it. If your category is not listed, click ""Kindle eBooks"" and select it from the new list that comes up. If it's still not listed, then no other books in your category use that keyword--this *might* be a good thing, but it might also indicate that the keyword in question is not very popular with readers of your genre.
7. If the category is present, select it and then repeat steps 4-5 above. Note the category-specific competition rank in yet another spreadsheet column. Then rinse and repeat for category #2, followed by the rest of your keywords with enough volume to consider bothering.
8. Depending on your dedication level and how popular your categories are, you may also want to repeat this process for the parents and grandparents of your categories, since your book will also show up there as well. Doing this exhaustively could suck up a lot of time, but in general you'll find after few searches the results are pretty predictable for how much a rank will go up for each child level. In my case, one of my categories is Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy -&gt; Science Fiction -&gt; Adventure. I spent most of my time looking around in the top level and in Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy -&gt; Science Fiction, while also dipping into the Adventure sub-category for some keywords I was particularly interested in. But there's no reason to check every single category level for every single keyword.

During this process, you should also be thinking about relevance. In general, you want the list of books that come up to be at least somewhat similar to yours. Of course, sometimes you may have a cross-genre book, like a space opera with elements of a political thriller, that you're comfortable being listed with a bunch of political thrillers. But other times, you want to avoid attracting readers that aren't looking for what you're offering. For example, in the novel I'm publishing, there is a lot of fictional stuff about mathematics, some of the heroes are mathematicians, etc. The problem is, while some fiction readers will be interested in those elements, it's obvious that the vast majority of searches for ""math"" or ""mathematics"" will be for math textbooks, so the volume numbers for these keywords should be considered to be seriously inflated at best.

**Step 4: Choose**

This is the easy part, only made difficult because Amazon limits you to seven options. But now you have all the data in front of you: (approximately) how many people are searching for each keyword, followed by (approximately) how popular your book has to be to show up in both a global and category-specific search. Generally speaking, you're looking for keywords that provide ""high"" numbers in all columns (keeping in mind that books numbered higher on amazon are lower ranked), but which ones you pick depends once again on your current standing and goals. Most likely, with a little salesmanship and dedication any book can break the top 300k; in this case, a medium-volume keyword where the first page contains 400k ranked books is gold. On the other hand, if you think you have the wherewithal to break 50k or even 10k with your book, then you'll want to target higher-volume, more generic and more competitive searches. And of course, don't be afraid to go back and repeat this process later if your book grows in popularity.

**Aside: How important are keywords?**

Very important, and also not important at all.

Keywords work as a form of ""passive"" promotion; you spend a few hours one time setting them up, and they will continue to pay dividends in the form of a steady trickle of exposure without you having to do anything. For a working writer, this is enormously useful, since it frees your time to write your next book instead of wasting it on active promotion. Chosen correctly, a good set of keywords can provide a recurring income that grows and grows with each new book you add to the market.

On the other hand, *all a keyword can do is put your book in a list of search results*. In order to actually sell a copy, your cover must be better than any of the other options available (although if you look at as many Amazon searches as I have, you'll realize quickly this isn't such a tall order), your blurb must draw the reader in, and your sample must seal the deal. If any of these elements are lacking, the best keyword in the world isn't going to help you at all, so while marketing can be interesting in itself, don't lose sight of what's important: putting out the best product you possibly can.

That's it. Good luck!

You've got your protagonist, antagonist and conflict. You've ~~wasted~~ spent time planning out the personalities, have a detailed, thorough outline. You write the rough draft, edit, edit again, and send it out for beta readers. And somehow, you get feedback stating your story is boring, bland, cliche, and formulaic. How?! You'd done everything right, hadn't you?

That depends. How much color did you add to your plot? By color, I mean do you have more than a black and white, good versus evil in your story? Or does it look more like a Napoleonic battle, with both sides lining up on a field of battle in neat ranks before rushing headlong at each other through a hail of cannon fire? If you said the latter, you have no color in your piece. Color can come in many forms, but this post focuses mainly on adding in other points of view to the narrative, so it's not so two-sided. 

Start with your central conflict. Try brainstorming all the possible ways it can be resolved- don't forget to put in the resolutions that the protaognists and antagonists have decided! Just this alone shows that there's more than just two sides to your story. So. Start putting them in!

When adding in these varied elements, remember not to make it seem like it's just a faction on one side or the other. How any one side sees the others should be different. There may be a scenario where Faction A sees Faction B as the lesser of three evils, when compared with Factions C and D. Yet, Faction C sees Faction D as heretics or traitors. Adding in these varied reactions will add depth to each faction, and to the characters.

Just because I say 'faction' or 'side', doesn't mean that there's more than one person in it. And have each faction interact with one another. Challenge the chaarcters to create their own conclusions for the faction, and come to change their preconceptions. This shows growth, and growth is important. Growth makes characters seem less bland and boring. 

Got that? All right, let's look at an example. 

You have your antagonist planning a corporate takeover of an apartment complex to knock them down and build a power plant. The apartment owners don't want to be homeless, so they try to prevent the takeover. It's black and white. So, let's add some color.

What about the landlord for the apartment complex? Maybe the money will go to building a set of apartments on a better lot. See how his motives can be non-evil, but his actions would go against the protagonists? What about nearby homeowners, who don't want to live near a power plant, and move to block the purchase. They do the right thing, but for selfish reasons. Add in an environmental group that doesn't want more pollution in the area- and will resort to violence to prevent the takeover. See now how varied and colored the conflict can be? Now, instead of a bland one side versus the other, you have a varied set of characters, with several different sets of consequences. 

So, now that you've got a better idea of coloring your plot, go do it! ",Characterization,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-characterization,,True,t3_18bec8,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/18bec8/writing_is_not_pvp_why_we_need_more_than_just_the/,

It was a slightly less-than-flattering post about NaNo that finally inspired me to post it. I figure it's a bit more productive for someone on the more neutral side of things to kick it off, though, so we can have actual discussion instead of putting one side so far on the defensive.

Now, when I'm talking about NaNoWriMo, I'm mostly talking about the culture *behind* NaNo. It's really not just a writing goal anymore; it's become, for better or for worse, a phenomenon. And the way I see it, there are two ways to interpret it:

**NaNo is great! It encourages people to shut up and write.**

NaNo *does* have a goal of actually writing, and writing a lot. People who participate in NaNo are encouraged to write as much as they can, even if they've never written before. It may not be the best writing, but of course that's not the point - the point is to get started on something you've been procrastinating on. For some people, they've been procrastinating on it their entire lives.

I won't go on about this part too much because it's the part of NaNo we're mostly familiar with - basically how NaNo sells itself to the public. 

**NaNo is stupid! It shields people from any real criticism.**

But at the same time, NaNo basically lets you write *anything* and get away with it. 50,000 words of Pokemon fanfiction? Sure. 50,000 words of the same repetitive sentence structure over and over? Fantastic. The word ""butt"" repeated 50,000 times? You win!

Part of the NaNo culture is feeling good and accomplished about writing 50,000 words, no matter what they are, in a month. But is this really something that needs encouragement? Start writing, yes, keep writing, yes, but if you're new to writing and you exist in a bubble for a month where everyone encourages everyone else *no matter how shitty they may be*, how is that going to impact your writing long-term?

----
In short, NaNo is a circlejerk, but that's what it was created to be. I'm having difficulty deciding whether that excuses it or makes it worse. I'll lay my cards on the table and say I've never been one for blind encouragement of effort. Sure, when you first make the leap to begin writing, that's great. I'll get behind it. But eventually I'm going to stop encouraging someone who writes crap to keep writing crap. It just seems unfair to *them*; they'll keep producing junk and think it's good. But then again, maybe NaNo is that first step for people, and needs all the encouragement it can get.

Another problem is, I can't really see writing 50,000 words in a month as an accomplishment. Sure, it's hard to do. Sure, I've failed to do it. Sure, I might want to give it a go someday. But I find much more value in finding a good pace to crank out writing year-round. Just because something is challenging doesn't make completing that challenge impressive unto itself. That's just me though.

This is kind of a long post to type out for waffling back and forth, but I figured I'd get my thoughts out there, as disorganized as they may be, to kick off the discussion. So what do you think? Is it *good* that NaNo is as encouraging as it is? Or is it encouraging the wrong things?

We know. It's a fairly safe topic to discuss around other writers or, for that matter, other literate human beings. We all love to feel superior to the sheeple shelling out money for dumb books about dumb things.

Take a step back for a moment, though, and realize that most popular books have a certain element of genius to them: they managed to get popular and stay popular *despite sucking in every conceivable way*.

I worked at a Barnes &amp; Noble part-time for about a year and a half. During that time, *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* suddenly exploded into popularity. Little naive me decided to give the book a read. I managed to get about two hundred pages before realizing nothing had come even close to progressing in the story. This in itself was sort of an achievement. No one can write 200 pages about nothing in quite the same way Stieg Larsson could.

Anyway, after adding *Dragon Tattoo* to the very short list of books I've started and never finished, I decided to ask customers about the book or its sequels whenever they bought it/asked about it. Subtly, conversationally, you know.

The responses were baffling and continue to be baffling to this day. Most of them bought it because they'd heard it was good, or been told it was good by some news outlet or other, and barely even knew what the book was about. When I mentioned the difficulty I'd had getting through the first book, *more than one* customer told me ""well, it's boring for the first half, but if you can get through it it's worthwhile.""

The first half of the book is two hundred pages! *Two hundred*! I think we've all experienced the frustration in trying to get someone to read just ten pages of one of our favorite books. And here these people were slugging through 200+ pages of material they themselves confessed to find boring. *Why?*

I haven't a clue. Maybe it's peer pressure. Maybe after a work hits a certain degree of popularity and news stories start running about it, people feel like they have to read it to stay in the know. Maybe it's because the author was dead, or the title was catchy. No idea. (I can tell you this, though - not one of them opened the book and started to read it before buying it. So don't bank on making a sale with your killer opening line.)

These are the questions worth asking about popular literature. It gets popular and stays popular somehow, and as many of us have already realized, writing skill has virtually nothing to do with it.

We’ll call one side of this fandom Ennui, also known as the “OMG-another-one-we’ve-seen-this-done-a-million-times!” faction. These are the people whose resounding battle cry is, “Let it *DIE ALREADY.”* They are the ones who say, “Ugh, another MMO? We already have WoW, why are you even trying to compete?” They bitch about tired character archetypes and recycled level design maps.

Lest I seem too scathing of this side of the house, let me be the first to say that as soul-sucking as some of this criticism can seem, it serves a valuable purpose in the creation of fictional worlds. Storytelling is a sort of enchantment, really one of the only spell bindings modern man has left (I’d nominate good cooking as a distant second).

One of the reasons that tired writing is dangerous and draws the attention of the Ennui hordes is because it destroys suspension of disbelief. On the one hand, character archetypes are extremely useful for writers – they touch something subconscious in our psyches, if you believe the likes of Jung and Joseph Campbell. Take, for example, the orphan/bastard king (think Alistair Theirin, Aragorn of Arathorn, and Luke Skywalker, to name a few). If it wasn’t a well-loved trope, the theme of everyman rising from obscurity to celebrity would never have survived as long as it has. But in order for it to work, any writer striving to use an archetype or an established setting/character must seek ways to make his character archetypes into real people.

Alistair, Aragorn, and Luke don’t resonate with people because they’re bastard kings – I mean, who can actually relate to that particular life experience? – but because they have been shaped into people who are as real to fans as many of the people who are walking around alive. Luke is the son of an Imperial overlord, but he’s also just a bored teenager who feels trapped in the boondocks of the galaxy – every too-smart kid from BFE, Montana or One-Horse-Town, Alabama can relate. Aragorn is afraid to turn into his father. This strikes a chord with anyone who has ever had a parent who failed them in some vital way, everyone from children of divorce to children of drug addicts. Alistair is afraid of the responsibility that is being asked of him, and doesn’t feel like he is good enough to shoulder the roles that he is expected to uptake. Speaking from personal experience, every English major who has spent years walking in the shadows of the likes of Hemingway and Faulkner and is then thrust into a world after graduation where they may or may not spend the next few years living in a cardboard box or working at Target to pay rent can relate to a heavy legacy that one may or may not be able to take on.

In short, the best antidote for fan ennui is realism. Your characters cannot feel like cardboard stand-ups and your settings cannot feel like Hollywood sets. They must have backstory, historical significance, favorite foods, popular culture, and – most importantly – a universe-specific conflict which drives them to continue the hero’s journey through whatever landscape they happen to be traversing, preferably with some moral ambiguity thrown in for good measure. Every hero must have moments of weakness, every villain moments of grace. These are the things that turn good stories into legendary ones.

The other side of this fandom equation is the people who believe that the universe was just fine the way it was, thankyouverymuch, and any attempts to extrapolate are akin to heresy. We’ll call these folks Purists, for lack of a more politically correct term. For these people, every *Star Wars* movie past the first three are blasphemy, no *Lord of the Rings* movie should ever have been made without mention of Tom Bombadil, and heaven forbid you ever write a sentence which might be either scientifically unsound or unbacked by wheelbarrows of lore-based research, because if you publish that sentence you’re getting a letter about it, by-gods.

These people also have their purpose, because for better or worse, these are your Die Hard Fans(tm). The folks who will stand outside a theater for days to get tickets, the ones who can give you the planetary specs of every sky-ball Shepard ever visited in *Mass Effect,* and could give an hour lecture on the genealogy of Westeros nobility. These folks will be buying your story when Ennui kids have already gotten bored and went home to play *Call of Duty.*

Purists are the antidotes to your plot holes and your *deux ex machinas.* Purists will *not* let you cheat, you dirty bird, and in that regard, they will make your writing better if you let them. They force you to go back to your backstory, searching for ways that you can make it deeper, and as a result, bring even more emotional resonance and realism to your story. They are the driving force behind worldbuilding. And if you spellbind them, they will be reading your stories and preaching – at length – about the glories of the world you built long after those driven by novelty have forgotten what made your world so great in the first place.",Inspiration,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-inspiration,,True,t3_1ig9z0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1ig9z0/im_in_your_universe_breaking_your_headcanon_ennui/,
1368118609.0,23,self.shutupandwrite,1e0e8q,Serial Writing,26,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1e0e8q/serial_writing/,"A quick search hasn't turned up anything, so here goes...

Serial fiction is slowly rising in prominence, but it's well behind staples like webcomics and standard fiction.  The idea is simple: the work isn't released as a complete text, but as a series of regular installments.  Mark Twain used to release his works in this fashion, and it slowly declined in popularity over time, until the internet made web serials a possibility.

Above all, I think serials really do exemplify the 'shut up and write' mentality.  It's a different and relatively unknown format, and I think that it really offers a lot in terms of what it does for the writing process, for the writer and the reader.

What does they offer to the reader?

*  Readers can pace themselves, which is nice for those who can devour a complete novel in 2-5 hours or for those who want something as a 'lunch break' read.
*  Readers can keep at pace with a community.  Excepting the people that are working on catching up, everyone is reading the same chapters at the same time.  This foments discussion and interaction with people of similar tastes.
* Serials are more fluid in format.  Where a book tends to be somewhat predictable in terms of rising action, climax, conclusion &amp; denouement, serials are harder to anticipate in the same 'there's only 50 pages left, the conclusion's coming soon' way.
*  Serials tend to *sprawl*.  With less restrictions as a whole, they can run longer or branch off into side stories.
*  Serials offer more exciting stories, as a general rule.  A book can afford to go on for 10 pages about the landscape or the bloody history of the Candy Kingdom, but the serial needs to draw the reader in for the next installment.  To do that, the serial author has to hook the reader, often through cliffhangers and unanswered questions.

More of interest to **you**, what does it offer the *author*?

*  Structure.  As fluid as the serial is, the act of setting a schedule and maintaining it can give you a framework and a natural forward momentum.
*  Feedback.  Readers benefit from community, but so do you.  You can get input on the work while it's in progress, a mutually beneficial relationship between you and the audience.  It's up to you how much you'll listen, but knowing which characters are well liked or what plot devices just aren't selling can make a difference if you get that input before you write the next 5,000 words.
*  Flexibility.  You can write and not dwell on the issues of fitting in a certain pagecount or standard.  Or it can serve to get your ideas on the page so you can get them into the right format later.
*  Income.  Writing as a whole is something of a combination between an investment and a gamble.  You put in hundreds or thousands of hours and only after you're done do you cast your line into the water and see if the bait catches.  Serial writing can leverage donations, merchandise, or ad revenue to bring in a little pocket change to make the process easier.  Truly successful serial writing can pay the bills while the story is in progress.  Best of all, none of this precludes the eventual sale of the work as a print novel or ebook (though it may throw a wrench into the works if you're aspiring towards traditional, big-name publishers - a heads up).

**Personal Experience**

Speaking for myself, I was a struggling writer for about ten years.  Couldn't get beyond a few pages, kept getting bogged down in editing and revising.  I started a serial because I wanted to keep moving forward, and I felt the schedule coupled with the pressures of audience expectations (though I didn't think I'd get more than five readers) would keep me going in a way that I wasn't on my own.

Serial writing was what got me in that mindset of 'shut up and write'.  I set my schedule (a proper, complete 'chapter' twice a week, each with a proper conclusion/cliffhanger/lead-in to the next chapter), and later scaled up the word count I was expecting of myself to a 4,000 word minimum.  Above all else, I forbade myself from missing an update.  No excuses, whether I had an ear infection or a cold, whether I was moving, or the power died, or I crushed my right hand in a car door.  Write, and keep writing.

In April of 2012 (10 months in) I set up a donation button, and promised a third chapter on any week that the total amount of donations reached a certain amount; $75.  I scaled up the amount over time, with the intent of writing one bonus chapter every two weeks (though the amount sits at $600 now, more to slow things down than out of expectations, and I'm writing two bonus chapters every three weeks to get caught up with the backlog).

I set my expectations low, telling myself that I wouldn't get any readers, any feedback or reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised in every respect, and I especially love seeing links pop up across the web, linking back to my work, even with the story still a ways from its conclusion (currently at 1,200,000 words in length, after nearly two years).

Maybe it's a new piece, maybe you're continuing a draft, or editing one, I really don't give a fuck. Point is, you're ready to work, like you're supposed to. 

**EXCEPT!**

You decide that you need to get into your comfortable sweats and put on something to listen to, something to really get you into the mood. Which is all fine and good, but I have one question for you.

If you didn't have these things, would you still be able to write?

If you said yes, you've got yourself a few writing aids. Items, sounds, or behaviors that assist in getting you to work. Things that you like to have around, but their absence won't keep you from sitting the fuck down and getting to business, like the goddamn boss you are. 

If you said no, fuck you. Seriously, just go find a corner and cry, because you're pathetic. Well okay, there may still be hope for you. Once you recognize that all those rituals and lucky footy pajamas and other bullshit are nothing more than crutches, hampering your ability to write. 

The first step to beating the shit out of a problem and leaving it in a gutter is to identify and admit it. So, if you've got the balls to finally admit that you're crutching it, there's hope for you. Writing is work. When you're at work, or in class, and you don't feel like doing something, what happens?

*Consequences*, motherfucker, that's what happens. 

Same thing for writing. You can whinge and bemoan your lack of progress, but when you're crutching, the only one standing in the way of that progress is you. Not the fact that some asshole took your favorite seat at Starbucks, or because the cat is sitting in the window and ruining your natural sunlight illumination. You're the only thing standing between yourself and that finished draft. 

Having writing aids is fine. Unwinding with a nice slice of key lime pie before getting down to business is fine. In fact, sometimes those aids are useful. But they're only help. All the work actually comes from you. Don't fuck yourself over on credit, and take some PFR- Personal Fucking Responsibility. PFR is a big deal. It doesn't just help you in writing, but in all aspects of your life. So knock out that excuse-making bullshit, turn on the music, and get to work.

1354978604.0,21,self.shutupandwrite,14hyxg,[Mythbusting] Rules are made to be broken.,22,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/14hyxg/mythbusting_rules_are_made_to_be_broken/,"**Ten Rules for Writing.**

There's just something sort of inherently pretentious about that phrase, isn't there?  Oh, you didn't know?  There are *rules* for writing.  You must follow the *rules* if you're going to write.  Do *these* things and more people will think you're great.  Do *those* things and you're **bad**, you're **naughty**, you're a **dirty-foot philistine and I'm going to murder you with a shovel**.

When it comes to writing, I can't really say that I don't like rules.  There are some great rules out there written by really insightful people, but they are not a dime a dozen and they typically can't be found on every half-cocked blog you see every day on other subreddits.  Really good rules are precious things like, say, diamonds.  They're rare, they're valuable, and someone was more than likely crushed to death in a mine somewhere trying to liberate them from the earth.  They're also not what I'm going to talk about today.

**Make sure you enjoy writing.**

One of the most common rules you may find, and also total shit.  You don't have to enjoy writing.  Hell, when you're somewhere in the middle between 20,000 and 20,001 words and you're wondering where the hell your life has gone over the last couple of months, you're probably not enjoying a damned thing.  You're lost, you're frustrated, you're doubting yourself, you're fearful of the devastation you'll feel if you really, truly decide to give up on this godawful endeavor and go walk the dog.

There will not always be butterflies and rainbows.  You're going to want to set your house on fire and conquering that urge will make you stronger.  Nothing about that situation is enjoyable, but it serves a purpose.  You keep writing.

Alright, one down.

**Love your characters.**

Fuck your characters.  

Maybe one of your characters does some really terrible shit because it feels like no one ever loved it.  That can't be true if *you* love it, and ultimately that will cheapen the whole experience of having that character burn down a nunnery.  Fuck that character.  Send that character to the gutter where it belongs and let it fester and suffer and grow bad mutton chops.

Think about life for a moment.  You are the character's creator.  To the character, you are god.  People sometimes do really terrible things or think really terrible thoughts for no other reason than the fact that they feel removed from their god.  God can be great, but god can also be silent in your most intense moment of pain.  Know which you need to be for your character and be it, but don't love the character unconditionally.  It might be a jackass.

The important thing is that your character evokes some sort of emotion.  Feed that character the emotion you want and it will regurgitate it for the reader.

**You don't owe anything to anyone.**

Better watch out, we got a badass over here.  You do owe something and you do owe it to someone.  That something is the rare feeling of getting one's time and money's worth, and that someone is the reader.  Do not forget that.

**Always start from the middle.**

Start from wherever the hell you feel like.  In some cases, the end is where you fart from.  It is entirely possible to start with one character and one situation and have that simple little scene turn into 80,000 words.  People do it every day and you can too.

**Try not to know how it ends.**

Doesn't really matter.  If you need to have the feeling that you're writing towards *something*, *anything* then go ahead and speculate about the ending.  Maybe you'll be right or maybe it'll change before you get there.  The really important thing is to stay loose, be dynamic, prepare yourself for anything and everything and don't be afraid to run alongside if the plot you've forged so meticulously decides to fly off the rails halfway through.

Maybe I'm preaching to the choir here and maybe I could go on for days anyway and maybe we could argue about whether my examples are 'rules' or 'guidelines' or whatever have you, but this kind of stuff really chaps my ass.  Rules, rules, rules.  Fuck the rules.  I say you'd be better off following no rules at all than following one bad one.  

I'm a writer.  You could say I'm an author or novelist, if you really wanted to.  Either way, just wanted to let you know that I'm not just plucking all of this out of thin air.

1339103368.0,21,self.shutupandwrite,uqfce,From Short Story to Novel,41,20,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/uqfce/from_short_story_to_novel/,"Oh Shit.  You know enough about the craft of writing to string together some ideas, make your sentences flow, get your point across for ten or twenty pages.

One night you wake up from a fever dream, ideas pumping like the Beverly Hillbillies just struck black gold in your brain, ideas for the best novel ever.  You realize, ready or not, you're about to write a book.  And you're damn right, you should.

But before you go approaching this task like you work the handful of short stories you've written, there are some things to consider.

First, these are apples and planets.  The only thing the two have in common are words/sentences, the carbon of your world as a writer.  There are a few other consistencies, but they can be lumped together with your carbon, or main building blocks.  Your approach, your methodologies, they will be different.

Second, Instead of one keen idea and branching details in a short story, a book consists of hundreds of these.  Planning is key.  Many of us have written so many short stories, it's rather easy to plot the 1-3 characters and their traits, plot the points that lead to conflicts, climax, and resolution, if any.  But a book, you'll need the much more preparation.

I'll use my current project as an example without going into too much detail.  I need to *______________ before I begin writing.  These methods change from writer to writer, but if you're transitioning from short story to novel (as this post assumes) follow these rules, break from them as needed.

1. Structure, structure, and more structure.  Start by taking note card (or using a program like Scrivener with a note card tool) and go basic- see below:

a. Dog finds a bone.

b. Bone has magical powers.

c. Dog can understand humans.

d. Dog overhears master in trouble.

e. Dog helps master.

f. Dog loses bone.

g. Dog accepts his ordinary life, reveling in owner's love.

2.  You're still not writing.  You going to flush out your outline several times.  All details, from what type of bone, to the human dilemma that needs solving, to the dialogue the dog hears, every single detail needs to be in place.  Expert writers used to the novel format don't need this.  But you do.  You're doing all the preparation now, in order to free your mind to write.  Change to the plot and structure can be made.  This is an evolution of creativity.  But from a beginner's standpoint, you have to understand the convention before you deviate from it.

3. Now that you have as much detail and structure as you can stand, and you're itching to write, you'll have a wait a bit longer.  Now's time for research and questions?

a. Read books about the canine relationship with dogs and owners.

b. Read books about talismans, about luck charms, about religious artifacts, and their presumed magical properties.

c. What human problems can a dog help solve?  Will it be entertaining?

This section is used to expose weaknesses the reader might find in your logic, and to use real-world research to add credibility, even in a children's book.  This section is vital and can't be skipped.  Here you're reading, jotting down questions, posing answers to yourself, and acting like a crazy person, allowing ideas to hit you and being prepared to write them down in church, on a subway, in the middle of sex.  Anywhere.

4.  Here's the part where you stop talking or seeing people.  You write.  You come home from work, walk your dog, split a can of tuna with your cat, you look at the dust on your TV.  You sit down and write, you might get up and pace with pad and pencil, you sit down and write more, thinking what crap it is.  But you move on, blind faith and the idea that you trust your story completely.  You must trust in this, or else it'll show in your writing.  Your doubt will show.

5.  You've written all scenes outlined, you've hammered out all dialogue and now is the time to reorganize, cut sections, add sections- this is your first edit.  It will take a large amount of time.  This is the equivilant of having a mound of clay in front of you and you must craft it so people who view the end result will see the same thing you saw all along in your head.  This is the hardest part of a very hard process.

6. Continuity, the thing you've been building up toward.  As a short story writer, you understand how to tell an intense yarn in a few pages.  But now each segment must flow into the next, each character must build themselves up, surprise the reader, gain the reader's trust, all progressively.  And most important, the story must lay itself out slowly, quickly, in steady steps, so the reader is neither overwhelmed nor bored.  A good novel carries with it a delicate balance.  And now that you've edited and sit with your second draft, it's time to work out those details.

The characters must change in a logical way, or defy change in a logical way.  Logical to them, so the reader can understand.  The plot must escalate, must build properly, and there should be several moments where the reader expects one thing and something entirely different happens.

7.  Next, a read-through and edit.  Does everything mesh?  Is something out of place or not belong?  Anything need clarification or did you over-elaborate?  

8.  Find a editor, shop the story around, pray nightly to Hermes and Bacchus, that your drunk episodes help you keep the faith until your book is picked up.

I want it noted that I'm vague for a reason.  I wrote this to inspire folks who are timid or overwhelmed by the idea of a novel.  This is by no means a how-to guide.

So, naturally, here I am doing it a day later.

Six months ago, we at /r/writingcirclejerk [had a dream](http://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/tjr78/lets_talk_what_kind_of_writing_community_would/). A dream that someday there would be, as /u/lophyte so eloquently put it:

&gt; I just want a writing community that's populated with people who realize writing is hard work and do it anyway, who want to discuss character development, outlining, plot devices, etc. Also, a place with no fucking delusional people would be great.

A few days later, we realized that dream. We set out to create a subreddit based on discussion, and not circlejerking. A subreddit where treating writing as mystic and unattainable would be banned as unproductive. A subreddit where people who actually *wrote* would discuss writing.

And we failed.

Which is a good thing, because that was all part of the plan.

----

You have to be a little bit delusional to create a subreddit that acts as an alternative to another subreddit with tens of thousands of subscribers. /r/shutupandwrite is one of those experiments that was built to fail. And with something that is made to fail, there is only one viable option: to fail *spectacularly*.

It worked. After a few extremely well-thought-out essays and a brief period of one user dropping entirely more knowledge than anyone on the subreddit could handle at once, /r/shutupandwrite fell mostly quiet. Oh, there were murmurs. There's the weekly check-in threads, for example. Or the occasional post that inevitably got ignored. But these were just the creaks of an abandoned house settling; /r/shutupandwrite was, and remains, fairly dead.

Running a community is a fair bit like writing, really. You can't possibly write your first novel and think to yourself, truly and honestly, that this is the novel that's going to make you rich, or famous, or whatever your endgame might be. Failure is the only realistic option. And you can either fail quietly, nitpicking at sentences no one will ever read, tiptoeing carefully around literary conventions, or you can fail *as hard as you possibly can*, writing exactly how you want to write, not giving a damn how off it might sound or how absurdly silly your plot is.

You'll learn something if you take either option, but one's going to help you learn a lot faster.

----

For the most part, you can get something out of a failure; often you end up getting more interesting things out of a failure than you do a success, because the positives of a failure tend to be a surprise.

In /r/shutupandwrite's case, the failure was the subreddit, but the success was our IRC channel. [#shutupandwrite](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=shutupandwrite) is [consistently active](http://shutupandwrite.net/ircstats/) and full of intelligent, interesting, thoughtful, funny people. When, several months ago, I thought to myself, ""I'd really like to meet other writers who aren't fucking delusional,"" I didn't think I'd be able to find so many in the same place. We've made an oasis on the Internet for writers actually *produce* and enjoy that process of production without taking writing to some mystical, otherworldly level. And if it took /r/shutupandwrite's failure to create that, then it was well worth it.

----

The past six months have been surprising. I was surprised that there were others like me out there, who wanted to talk about writing with people who didn't sit around feeling sorry for themselves all the time. I was surprised that there were *so many* of us, and that we continue to grow.

What do the next six months have in store for us? I don't know; I can't know. I didn't think we'd get here. But I'll tell you where I wish we would go.

I think we are awesome. I think we should take that awesome and show the rest of the world how awesome we are. If we could even take a fraction of the interesting stuff that goes on in the IRC channel and find a way to channel that into the subreddit, we'd have one of the most information-dense writing subreddits on the entirety of Reddit. In the past few days we've been moving towards that already, and it's pretty sweet to see that. I'd also like some of us to branch out into the Real World a little bit more. Join a writing group. Talk us up. Maybe even host a meetup in the name of SU&amp;W. It seems far off now, but who knows where we'll be in terms of reach in another half-year.

We may very well fail. But, as with writing, that's what makes any of this *fun*.

Ladies and gentlemen, the state of the community is *pretty damn awesome*.

1352500009.0,21,self.shutupandwrite,12xpsf,Getting Shit Published - information from a writer and a publisher of Graywolf Press,22,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/12xpsf/getting_shit_published_information_from_a_writer/,"Let me start by saying that I am neither the writer nor the publisher mentioned in the title.  Fiona McCrae and J.R.Lennon conducted a panel at my school about their experiences with the publishing industry.  I felt it very informative, and I took lots of notes to share with you guys.  As a whole, I found it less advice-based and more fact-based.  In the end when people started asking questions about what they should do to get published, Fiona and J.R. essentially just responded with ""good luck...""


**Biographical Information**

Graywolf Press is an independent publishing company that publishes about 30 books a year, made up of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.  They do not publish genre fiction, but rather literary fiction - I'll get into that later.

Fiona McCrae is the director of Graywolf Press.

J.R. Lennon is an author who has been published by Graywolf Press.  (He's also a professor of advanced creative writing at Cornell University.)


**Fiona McCrae on ""literary"" fiction**

Graywolf Press is a small publishing company, as I said, and they have the luxury of choosing the books they publish.  They prefer not to engage in huge bidding wars because there ends up being this expectation that the book needs to sell a certain number of copies to be successful.  They don't like being strapped in this uncomfortable scenario.

Additionally, Graywolf Press prefers to publish ""literary fiction.""  So let me define what that is. Genre fiction is all about plot and the story, usually set in a particular genre with its own set of rules. Then there is a set of writing that's all about the structure and the actual *way* you write. Literary fiction is a marriage between these two forms of writing - it blends an interesting plot and story with an interesting, unique, creative, experimental way of telling the story.  In particular, Fiona mentioned that ""a strong voice/slant and style, surprising language "" are elements that really attract Graywolf Press. 

What I got out of this is that if you really want to publish literary fiction, try looking around at houses that are concentrating on this kind of fiction instead of the Big Ones.  In fact, it could be fair to generalize this a bit.  If you want to get a particular type of work published, try scouting for smaller houses that focus on that genre.


**Fiona McCrae on book launches**

Most of you may be familiar with book launches - the idea is that you have to thrust a book into the market as soon as it's published.  If you don't thrust it out enough, it may fall flat and possibly never sell.

However, she cited the case of Salvatore Scibona who had such a unique voice and style (with some minor adjustments) that Graywolf had to publish him.  Unfortunately, after the initial review or two, absolutely nothing happened.  In fact, nothing happened for 7 months, and miraculously the book ended up winning an award and then there was an explosion.  Fiona says if you do manage to get published, don't lose hope if you don't sell right away.


**Fiona McCrae on literary agents &amp; query letters**

In general, Graywolf likes to have lit agents for fiction but not for poetry. It occasionally takes fiction that doesn’t have a literary agent, but Fiona said that they haven’t had much luck sifting through the slush piles.

Someone asked a question about query letters, but I gathered from Fiona’s response that every publisher is peculiar in what they prefer.  Fiona in particular prefers only 2-3 lines of description about the piece in the letter, perhaps what other works the piece resembles that the publisher has also published, and maybe even the authors and professors the writer has studied under.  She emphasized that she really likes in the query letter instances of being published elsewhere, particularly short stories published in literary magazines.  It shows her that the writer is serious about getting published and not just wildly throwing their manuscript around.

However, she prefers the manuscript with the query letter so that she can reduce the number of times she has to communicate with the author.  The query letter usually says nothing about what the piece actually is.

Finally, both J.R. and Fiona really suggested networking and getting out and knowing people because sometimes this leads to opportunities you would have never expected otherwise.


**Fiona McCrae on miscellaneous**

Apparently killing the mother often makes manuscripts better.
*Context (because that’s necessary when making a sweeping claim such as this): Fiona’s husband is a children’s writer, and he was writing a book with the father and son in the front seat and the mother and daughter in the backseat.  He realized the people in the back seat were actually absolutely unnecessary for the storyline, so he got rid of them, much to his dismay.  It’s a joke in the industry that killing the mom ends up improving writing, and he didn’t want to fall into that stereotype.*

Also, never start with a character in an airplane seat landing in the airport. Begin with the character already landed. Begin somewhere that has some kind of significance.


**J.R. Lennon on literary agents, his publishing experience, and writing process**

J.R. basically just wrote letters to agents of authors who wrote similarly to him, and added that in his query letter.  Eventually he got an agent.  (Sounds like luck to me.)

J.R. got published by Riverhead, I believe, and his first book sold 75k copies. However, he has never sold that many copies of books since then.  He thinks part of the reason was that he’s a writer of literary fiction in a culture that’s valuing it less and less.  Luckily for him, he’s getting a bit more popular, but he said that it sometimes never gets easier to sell a book.  He still routinely gets rejected and he just has to deal with that.  Part of being a career writer is knocking on doors all over the place.

He did get published by a major house once, and he said his experience was always a bit unpleasant because the houses were always coming out with a book that was more important.  At Graywolf, he got a team more hands-on with editing and also with marketing. He enjoyed the experience with Graywolf far more.

As for his process, he tends to produce quickly and edit many times.  This process part depends completely on the writer; he generally has several people read it and makes many edits to his novel before he pushes it off to his editor, but this is slightly different for every book.

Someone asked J.R. when he knows a book is finished and the answer he gave was “never. I will never, ever, not to the day I die believe a novel is finished.  But after a certain amount of time, you just have to give it up and not give it another look.”


**Conclusion**

Overall, I got out of this discussion that for some writers, getting published is easy after the first book.  For others, it's a constant struggle to write something others will want to read. I thought both speakers offered unique insight into the publishing world from a perspective other than the major houses.

What do you guys think?  How does your process differ from J.R.'s? Did Fiona say anything that surprised you?

In fact, I'm not; quite the opposite really.

See, the one thing that will make me unlikely to finish reading a piece (or at least to finish it without too much eye-rolling) is when I can feel the author trying too hard to grab my attention. When the first sentence is full of blood and contradictions, there's a decent chance the author can't or won't keep up that level of intensity. Why would I want to continue reading the story's already blown its proverbial load?

Maybe I'm unique in this, but I've never felt ""grabbed"" by the first sentence or even the first paragraph of a story. It's absurdly difficult to construct a full scene in such a short space of time. That's not to say it can't be done or hasn't been done, but it's damn hard to pull off. Yet somehow this is an oft-repeated bit of writing advice given to people independent of their genre or skill level, resulting in hooks that are painfully obvious and ill-fitting.

Here's how I see it. I start to read a story. Somehow I managed to get to this point. I've cleared my head, swatted away distractions, and I'm ready to be absorbed in your story's world. *You already have me.* Stop trying to provoke shock and awe on page one.

That's not to say the opening of a story isn't important. There's a lot you can glean from the first few sentences - the style, the POV, the characters... I could go on. Shocking, in-your-face statements don't intrigue me. Maybe a witty line or a thoughtful question, but not ""omg! action.""

I'm going to steal someone else's opinion here and say that hooks are designed to work on editors and publishers, but not a general audience. A general audience does not typically browse a bookstore, read the first sentence or two of each book, and decide accordingly. They're far more likely to have heard about it from somewhere, have a general idea of what the book is about, maybe read the inside flap, and buy it. Either that or they'll sit there reading it for a few minutes and then decide. I don't think many people make decisions based on a ""hook"" alone.

Of course, this is all my experience and observation. Maybe traditional hooks do work for some people. So to conclude I'll just ask this: what *does* intrigue you about a book enough to keep reading?

Ask yourself that question. For every answer you come up with, ask it again. Is there anybody else this hurts more?

I have a tendency to come up with vague ideas for worlds or situations. For example, a record-breaking earthquake destroys a city.

That's not a story, it's a vague concept of a situation. I always have troubles turning that concept in to a story, and I've found that asking myself, ""who does this hurt most?"" leads me to interesting conclusions.

Take humanity itself as an example, sure our races have basic stereotypes, but after that, no two people are the same in likes, skills, opinions, etc. They may have regional customs, but that is as far as it goes.

Also, once people have the means to travel, travel they will. They will ""mix"" with other races, and a city will not remain a city of a single race for very long.

I learned to read at five, and naturally began writing stories about princesses and princes and knights and the like, as befitted my wonderfully cheery, girly imagination. The stories were never more than one or two pages, but I kept writing them.

When I was in my earlier teens, I decided to write a short novel (or novella, if you would) that was aimed at kids, probably from age ten to age fifteen or so. I undertook this task with a friend, and we made some good headway. My mother read some of it, though, and begged the question: **Why is everyone white?**

I honestly hadn’t thought about it. My main character, Sam, was a fiery redhead with freckles and a slight temper. Her younger sister was a girly, princess-obsessed brunette named Zoe. The people from the ‘other world’ were all… well, white (and tended to have very peculiarly colored eyes). I added in a few black characters, just for diversity sake, and it went *relatively* well until school started up again, creativity sputtered, and we dropped the story altogether.

That little comment from my mom has always reminded me to make sure I wasn’t idealizing any one particular kind of character. I grew up with the idea that behaving a certain way, looking a certain way, or living a certain way was “better” and thus I transposed this into my stories. I now focus on building characters, not stereotypes. I don’t do token characters—If someone is going to be Black, or gay, or rich, or a supermodel, it’s going to be because that’s their character, not because it’d be an ‘ideal’ inclusion. I was a little put off with the thought at first, ‘Why *can’t* they all be white?’, but it has honestly pushed me to make more dynamic characters, and gives my stories that much more depth.",Characterization,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-characterization,,True,t3_1354wd,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1354wd/all_white_everything/,

They’re up in the clouds, their accomplishments are many and varied, and we mortals cannot compete. You look at the pitiful first draft in front of you and you think “Oh god, why am I even doing this?” This leads to a loss of confidence that brings us to writing forums where we sit and discuss what tools we use, how people get the work done, and wonder aloud about whether anyone feels the same way we do (answer: yes) instead of actually getting down to the business of writing.

 The solution I’ve found lies in embracing an open secret: all of the great creators suck in some way, and they all make mistakes. Highlighting those mistakes makes them seem a bit more approachable. Since this is meant to point out that we’re not all that far from the authors everyone knows, I’d like to address modern fantasy’s biggest name: J. R. R. Tolkien.

Let’s look at his prose. The man was horrible at telling a story. He couldn’t write something exciting if his life depended on it. The reason for this is that the stories of Middle Earth are written in the form of histories: dry and void of emotion except for a few moments that are over far too quickly. These stories are not presented as fiction, and that’s a big problem. A novel should not give its reader flashbacks to history classes spent half asleep.

Tolkien couldn’t move a story forward at a good pace. His entire career, his approach seems to’ve been “never describe in one sentence what you can describe in several paragraphs, especially if it never needed describing to begin with”. The poetry and songs are pointless and there are several events going on throughout the books that are irrelevant to the plot. Do you know why the scenes with Tom Bombadil or the barrow wight were cut out of the Lord of the Rings movies? Because they are *utterly unimportant*.

Tolkien designed his characters around stereotypes rather than as individuals. As a result, these characters are all quite predictable once you learn their type. To make a bad situation worse, the dialogue is boring and sounds forced. This is where Tolkien sucks the very most, because unique, relatable characters are essential to creating a moving story.

Finally, Tolkien’s plots throughout all of his books are taken right out of mythology with almost no editing or inspiration. You can identify the sources he nabbed his material from simply by following along. The Silmarillion is a retelling of the Abrahamic creation myth. The Hobbit is a redesign of Beowulf. Lord of the Rings is about as inspired as it gets by blending multiple themes, but it still falls short of complexity in that the book sees everything in terms of black and white, good and evil. There is no middle ground, nobody is caught by moral grey areas. Either you’re on the good side, the evil side, or entirely irrelevant to the story.

Pre-Tolkien we were given masterpieces like Alice in Wonderland, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Conan the Cimmerian, and A Princess of Mars. Tolkien decimated a vibrant and open fantasy landscape, creating a cage that most fantasy authors simply refuse to see beyond. We're held back by so many preconceived notions about fantasy thanks, in large part, to him. Those novels that break this mold stand out simply for the fact that they go against the grain.

**TL;DR:** Tolkien’s prose is boring and his characterization is bad. His plots meander, they’re overly simple and completely uninspired.

Disclaimer: So who the fuck do I think I am, right? I have obvious flaws in my own writing, and I’m not trying to say otherwise. The fact is that I love Tolkien, and the world he created is vast, complex, and alive. I’ve spent hundreds of hours wrapped up in his books, read them through multiple times, and he’s probably one of my favorite authors of all time. This post is not meant to say Tolkien is horrible. If anything it’s meant to say the opposite. Whatever flaws you think you might have, the only way that can defeat you is if you let it. Just keep writing.

What should I be writing? Should I just let my fingers spit out any old word? I know there are days where I’m mentally exhausted and my brain is stuck on repeat. I end up thinking of  the same word thirty times in a row. Does typing this word thirty times in a row really help me write better?

Which skills are being improved? The skill of letting myself write garbage so the good stuff comes out when I’m done? What about the days when the garbage never gets out of the way? Is that still helping somehow?

Or should I focus on specific techniques? Description, dialogue, exposition, etc. But if I’m focused on ‘improving’ these things, doesn’t that mean my left brain is getting in the way of my right brain?

Does the writing subconsciously increase my vocabulary over time? How?

Does writing every day just make me more open to new ideas?

Does this everyday writing include analysis? If not, should it? If I don’t consciously try to review my work, am I cheating myself out of improvement?

This is part of what makes overly cliched plots unenjoyable. You *know* what's going to happen next - or to be more specific, it requires very little creative thought to predict what will happen next. That's not to say a story with a cliched plot is unenjoyable, of course, but something *besides* the plot must carry it, because the plot by itself is boring.

Plots are exciting when you don't have enough time to come up with a creative solution before the plot delivers it to you. And this, in my opinion, is why it is not only expected for writers to get stuck, but imperative that they do.

""Getting stuck"" isn't passive, as [John Cleese points out in this video you really ought to watch if you haven't yet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VShmtsLhkQg). Instead, it's an active period of creative thought. Just because you aren't getting results doesn't mean your subconscious isn't working on it. (Unless you're not bothering to think about your problem at all, you lazy bum.)

Regardless, it's still a bit weird to get used to being stumped as being productive. You have to believe that, somewhere down the timeline, future-you is typing up the solution to your problem, and it's an awesome one. You have to trust that you *will* solve the problem. And you have to realize that the discomfort you feel is important, because it's the discomfort your audience will feel - and that discomfort is vital to get them absorbed in your story's conflict.

On the flip side, if you feel like you can bang out a detailed plot in a relatively short space of time, it might be worth rethinking how you plot. Are you taking the easy and predictable ways out? Are you failing to escalate the conflict enough? Do you keep the audience guessing, or is it painfully obvious what will happen next?

The best thing to do with these questions is to answer them in the voice of your character.

Just Plain English,37,22,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/vgvqi/rules_of_writing_not_flowery_not_newspeak_just/,"*r/shutupandwrite, I posted this to my magazine's blog this morning and thought it relevant to your cause. (Not going to link it. I just don't swing that way.* [#NoPromo](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/AaRzpeGj7UU/0.jpg)

A few years before the release of his now-classic dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell penned an essay he titled “[Politics and the English Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language).” Somewhat of a dense read, this essay packs quite a punch with the information it contains. Admittedly, some things he discusses are not as relevant today as others, but overall, it ought to be a must-read for all writers of the English language.

You may think to yourself, “But it must be all about politics. I don’t want to read any of that stuff. With it being an election year, I hear too much about politics as is.” You’d be partly correct about the politics statement. But that means you would also be partly wrong. Orwell took most issue against English becoming a bureaucratic and stale language, with [Newspeak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak) in Nineteen Eighty-Four being a prime example. According to Orwell, Newspeak is such a toned-down version of the English language that speakers of Oldspeak (English) would have trouble understanding it.  Such a stripped-down language would no longer be able to convey the sincerity and conjure the imagery a language containing a much broader range of vocabulary could.

A similar effect applies to “flowery” language, where a writer—or speaker—overuses words to supply too much description. Though an ample—and often overabundant—amount of imagery has been provided, the main idea the writer wants to convey is usually lost. Our brains, as awesome as they are, can be a lot like RAM in a computer: they both have a processing limit. Try feeding a computer too much information and it slows down, sometimes even coming to a halt; try feeding too much information to another person and you will get a blank stare. That blank stare is a lot like the Spinning Rainbow of Death. It signifies when processing is at its limits. However, as a writer, much of the time you won’t be able to see those blank stares. Unable to fix your mistake in the moment, you will have to plan and prevent yourself from divulging too much information ahead of time.

If you need any assistance in that, Orwell had six great rules for keeping your language simple.


**George Orwell’s Six Rules on Writing**

**1) On the Use of Overused Figures of Speech**

&gt;*Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.*

**2) On Choosing the Length of Words**

&gt;*Never use a long word where a short one will do.*

**3) On Unnecessary Words**

&gt;*If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.*

**4) On Choosing Voice for a Sentence**

&gt;*Never use the passive where you can use the active.*

**5) On Alien Words**

&gt;*Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.*

**6) On the Previous Five Rules**

&gt;*Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.*

The first dimension is **physical**. This is the stuff that one-dimensional characters are made of: height, weight, gender, age, hair colour, eye colour. All the physical, visible details we see. This may be important to you as a writer, but very little are necessary to the reader. Focus on unique physical characteristics which set your character apart from every other blonde-haired, blue-eyed damsel in distress.

The second dimension is **sociological**. Think about your character's history. Where did he grow up? What kind of life did he live? Was he a rich spoiled brat, or did he grow up in the slums? Or were his parents the average middle class type? What kind of education did he get? Does he like to have lots of friends around, or is he more introverted? Think about real people: their personalities are shaped by many factors as a child. Think about the sorts of things that happened to your character that shaped him or her.

The third dimension is **psychological**, which delves deep in to the mind. What is her biggest fear? What does she fantasize about? What is her life goal? Does she have a bucket list? What does she value in life? What are her priorities — career, family, relationships? Is she above average in intellect, or did she flunk first grade? All books I've read on writing — and I've found it works for me too — instruct you to be a student of human nature. Watch people. Ask yourself why they do the things they do. It's amazing how many story ideas you can come up with this way too, by watching people and coming up with elaborate backstories for how they came to be.

All of these factors add up to create a real, living, breathing person. And all of these dimensions are intertwined: a person's physical traits have an affect on their sociological and psychological traits. Their experiences with people at a young age will shape how they think and view the world. And how they think and view the world will, in turn, affect how they interact with people at an older age.

In addition to all of that, there's several things that your characters need in order to develop a strong story overall. They must have desires. Your characters must want something —  to rule the world, to write in peace without distractions, to skip work for a week and party in Vegas — and each characters' desires must conflict with the others. When you have two characters who are diametrically opposed in their desires — Bob wants to write without distractions, but Mary wants Bob to pay more attention to her — you have tension. Think of it like tectonic plates, where each character is a different plate moving toward the other. Along the edges where they meet, they push and rub and build up pressure. Small little rumbles release a little bit of the tension. Finally, once the pressure hits a critical point — your climax — the tension is released through a violent and amazing earthquake.

Your character should also have a history. How detailed or not is completely up to you as the author, but you should have some idea of where this person came from, what kind of life they had growing up, and so on, at least to the point where you can explain some of their key characteristics through their history. There are different approaches to creating a history for a character. Writers who do a lot of prewriting planning may create full character profiles with elaborate biographies that span several pages. Writers who write ""by the seat of their pants"" may just come up with backstory elements as they come across new characteristics while writing. There is no right or wrong way to do it, so long as you are consistent with your characters.

Making a strong, memorable character can also be achieved by playing with stereotypes. If you have an idea for a character that you find is way too stereotypical — an alcoholic private eye — give him or her a problem or another trait that breathes some fresh life in to him or her. Maybe she's a sucker for soap operas. Maybe he has an obsession with order, borderline OCD about keeping things neat and tidy. This could add some internal conflict when things get messy.

Remember, though, that you want to maintain believability. Whatever traits or characteristics you give your characters, it needs to be consistent within their lives, just like real people.

The final thing is to make your characters interesting and keep them real.

*Well*, I hear you say. *That's a pretty vague statement.*

Let me elaborate. If your character gives up easily and sits in his bedroom and complains about his life, he is not interesting. He is not doing anything about his situation. Your characters don't need to be gun-toting bullet-dodging spies, but they do need to be willing to do something about their situation. A character who sits and waits for other people to help is a boring character.

This also ties in to believability. When your character does something, you need to ask, would he really do that? If your protagonist is a nerdy type who enjoys sitting alone at home reading books, would he really go jumping over buildings and getting in to firefights? Let's say there's someone after him — a hit man or the mafia or something. For whatever reason. What would your protagonist do in this situation? What is he willing to do and how far is he realistically willing to go?

That wraps up my discussion on building strong characters. Please also see [lumiras' post on interviewing characters](http://redd.it/u4f82), and [lngwstksgk's post about coming up with new characters](http://redd.it/u5aso).

Most important of all, have *fun* writing.

First readers are the people who will see the work you have submitted to a literary magazine before the editors ever will. These are the unpaid minions (usually interns) who go through the submissions before they are culled into a smaller pile for the editorial staff to pick and choose from. **They are the real gatekeepers you have to woo – not the editors.** For the most part, unless you catch the eye of a first reader, the editor will never know you exist. 

Depending on the size of the magazine, first readers (or slushies – *mush slushy, mush!)* will have to go through hundreds or even thousands of submissions a week. That is *millions of words.* Do you think that they actually go through and carefully read every one of those millions of words? Hell no. Because that is purgatorial and a waste of time. 

The truth is, a first reader can usually tell from two things whether a writer is serious about submitting or not:

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind, here are ten pieces of advice that will help make a first reader fall in love with you:

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new, proofread. Competition is fierce. If there is a typo in your query letter or the first page of your submission, there is a 99.9% likelihood it is going in the trash.

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day. Saying anything to the effect of, “Oh man, you must publish my story, it is the best thing since *War and Peace* and together we will win a Pushcart with it and you would be a moron not to publish it” is going to get your query letter passed around the editorial office and laughed at. True story.

* **Revise.** Once you have finished a story, set it aside for a week or two and work on something else. Come back to it with fresh eyes. Rework it. Do an extremely thorough **self-edit** or proofread. Get someone to **beta read** it (preferably someone who is not your mother) for a subjective second opinion. **Revise it some more.** Cut the fat. Expand parts that are sparse, but keep in mind – especially if you are submitting a short story – that it is important to keep your work as tight as possible. There is only so much room in any given magazine and you are competing ferociously for it. If a first reader finds typos and grammatical errors in the first page of your story, you can be sure they will not read past the first page. 

* **Read the magazine you’re submitting to.** Get a subscription if you can. Most lit mag subscriptions are laughably cheap. Not only will you be helping to support and uphold the industry you are trying to get money and recognition out of, it will let you know the general tone and style of the stories the editors pick, so you will be more likely to get a positive response by sending a story along the same lines. 

* **Don’t try to be cute.** It’s okay to be charming and show a little wit in your query letter, but there is a fine line. Having a sense of humor is okay, coming across as a smart-aleck assclown will not endear you to your first reader. 

* **Don’t try to be edgy.** Same premise as the previous point, but the opposite. If your main character says “fuck” every other word and is generally a bad-tempered *Catcher in the Rye* knockoff, the first reader is probably going to roll their eyes and move on. 

* **Make the first page of your story the strongest in a narrative sense.** If there is anything boring in the first page of your story, it better not be there by the time you get ready to send it in for publication, because if there is, the first reader is going to assume the rest of the story is boring too, and move on to the next thing in the slush pile. 

* **Read the submission guidelines.** If the submission guidelines say that they want the manuscript in Arial, triple-spaced, every other word in bold, by-gods if you want to publish in that magazine you will do exactly what they say. Because here’s a secret: sometimes ridiculous submissions guidelines are a test. They are a test to see how well you pay attention, or whether you’re someone who thinks that the rules don’t apply to you (the latter is a group of people that editors hate to work with). They are a test to see how bad you want it and how professional you’re capable of being. Flaming hoops of formatting guidelines is part of that process. If you want to be published, you will follow every single instruction that is given to you. 

* **Impressions are important.** If you make a good impression or get published in a magazine, any further submissions may be flagged for a higher priority of consideration than others in the slush pile. This is a very good thing for you. If, on the other hand, you make an ass of yourself by not following any of the rules above, the first readers will remember you, and not in a loving way. Don’t let that happen to you.  

* **Don’t send simultaneous submissions.** Granted, *some magazines don’t mind this,* and will make a point to say so in their submission guidelines. If there is no mention of “simultaneous submissions allowed” in the guidelines, do not submit to multiple magazines at the same time. Simple as that. Wait for a rejection letter before sending your work out to someone else. Nothing makes an editor shake their fist at the heavens more than to go through the cut rounds, pick a story they really like, only to see that that story has already been accepted elsewhere. It’s bad form. Don’t do it.

* **Consider the person on the other side of your submission.** They are usually unpaid, tired, eyesore, hungry, thirsty, and in dire need of a stiff drink. They are in the literary business because they love good writing, the same as you do. They are not the blackhat gatekeepers who are sabotaging your efforts at traditional publication. They are just doing their jobs, which is to make sure that they get the very best stories for the publication they’re working at. They have pride in their work, and they want you to have pride in yours too.

1372545530.0,17,self.shutupandwrite,1hc12k,"Writing, wikis, and you",17,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1hc12k/writing_wikis_and_you/,"Whenever the topic of ""organizing your shit"" is discussed, one of the more frequent suggestions is to use a wiki. That's not a bad idea, but it is an open-ended one. I've used a few wikis with varying degrees of success. Feel free to leave comments about your own experiences with wikis, but I thought I'd make a post detailing what I know.

###First things first: What is a wiki?
A wiki ([backronym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym): What I Know Is) is a website designed for the general public to edit, either anonymously or using a chosen account, with the intent of collecting as much information about a particular subject as possible (with the exception of Wikipedia, which wants *everything*, the greedy bastards). With this in mind, the idea of a ""private wiki"" seems backwards. However, there are certain elements of the wiki model that lend itself to private use quite well.

###Advantages of a wiki
Most, if not all, wiki software is designed to meet two goals: ease of collaborative editing and ease of navigation. The more advanced collaborative tools (i.e. merging conflicted edits, talk pages, etc) will likely go unused in a private wiki, but the second goal &amp;mdash; ease of navigation &amp;mdash; is where a wiki as an organizational tool can really shine.

The trick to organizing one's notes is to put relevant information in a logical place to make it easy to reference later. A wiki can be very good at this if you understand how to use it properly. However, if you don't see yourself using wiki-specific features for your notes, a simple text document (or collection of text documents) might be easier in the long run.

###Disadvantages of a wiki
Most &amp;mdash; again, not all &amp;mdash; wiki software is written to deal with large volumes of data. To that end, they are designed to give the most screen space to the content of any one article. This can result in the impression that short ""articles"" in your notes are bad because they don't *look* right. It doesn't make sense to make the comparison between your notes (which are exactly as long as you need them to be) to a featured Wikipedia article, so don't do it. Just because a page is empty doesn't mean you need to spend more time brainstorming to fill it up.

Additionally, wiki software, as with any software, can add an unwanted layer of complexity to your notes. Some wiki software is intuitive to use, other software isn't. If it feels like a wiki is hindering your writing process more than helping it, stop using it and use something else. Wikis aren't for everyone, and they certainly aren't for every project.

###Wiki software
If you'd like a more complete list of wiki software, check out [Wikipedia's page on the subject](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software). I'll only go over what I have used myself and how I've found it to be useful or not.

####TiddlyWiki
For personal projects, [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/) ([github](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/tiddlywiki)) probably wins hands-down. TiddlyWiki belongs to a certain category of wiki software known as ""wiki on a stick"" &amp;mdash; that is, easily deployable wiki software for personal use. TiddlyWiki lives inside one self-modifying file, a mish-mash of HTML and JavaScript.

TiddlyWiki is simple to download, deploy, and even to move around &amp;mdash; you can stick it in your Dropbox or Google Drive and view/edit it elsewhere. However, note that you'll need Java installed to save any of your work on it. (There's a good technical reason for this: a static file cannot modify itself unless it calls an external program, `TiddlySaver.jar` in this case, to do the work for it.) If you want portability across *all* devices, there are definitely better options, but you won't find a wiki easier to use than this.

One of the things I personally like about TiddlyWiki is the way it solves the ""every page has way too much space"" issue by loading each page (or ""Tiddler"" as I think they're actually called) on top of the previous page, keeping a feed of pages and their content in the center column in the order you visited them. It makes going back to previous ""tiddlers"" (why am I typing this) a snap. There's not much in the way of customization but that's a good thing. You're using it for notes, not to host your own personal website.

All in all I highly recommend checking out TiddlyWiki first before moving on to alternative wiki software. If you do need a wiki for writing notes, it fits the majority of use cases and it's damn simple to use.

####Wiki on a Stick
Okay, remember before when I pointed out ""wiki on a stick"" was a category of wiki software? Well, there's also a piece of software called, literally, [Wiki on a Stick](http://stickwiki.sourceforge.net/) ([sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/stickwiki/)). You may now be confused, it's okay.

Wiki on a Stick (or, as the website so helpfully abbreviates, WoaS) is another open-source project similar to TiddlyWiki. Like TiddlyWiki, it lives in one self-modifying file. Also like TiddlyWiki, the only requirements for running WoaS are a browser and Java. Unlike TiddlyWiki, however, WoaS displays wiki pages in the more traditional, one-entry-per-page manner. So for those of you confused or disoriented by TiddlyWiki's way of doing things, give WoaS a go.

Personally, I lean more towards TiddlyWiki than Wiki on a Stick for one simple reason: active development. TiddlyWiki is a popular project that many people are actively working on; the same can't be said for WoaS, sadly. It is open source and anyone (even you!) could pick up development on it, but for the time being, there's a bit of a dry spell going on.

####WikidPad
So far we've only covered solutions that work with a browser. Makes sense, considering wikis started out as ""editable websites,"" something obviously browser-based by nature. However, I have come across an executable wiki if you want to keep your browsing and note-taking separate for some reason. It's called [WikidPad](http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/) ([sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikidpad/)) and it's open-source, cross-platform software.

WikidPad does have some advantages &amp;mdash; for one thing, the entire wiki structure is always visible (and therefore easily navigable) in the left pane of the program, and nesting pages is simple. For another, it's fully documented (in wiki format, of course) and comes up with this neat little reference wiki when you first start it up. It's also got at least half-assed [WYSIWYG editing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG), unlike most wiki solutions. In edit mode, the syntax is always visible, but it applies the proper formatting to that syntax as well, so bold text will appear as **\*bold text*** as opposed to \*bold text\*. You can toggle between editing and ""preview"" modes, of course, but since you'll be spending most of your time in edit mode anyway it's a nice touch.

WikidPad is powerful: it allows for complex grouping of information, exports to HTML, and even has support for scripting. It is, however, more complicated than other solutions, and is more suited to complex projects where you have a vast amount of information to organize. (And if you're in that situation, ask yourself if you're really writing a story!) Still, if you're looking for a non-browser-based solution, WikidPad does the job and you can ignore all the bells and whistles that come along with it.

####DokuWiki
[DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) ([github](https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki)) is one of the two server-based wikis I'll mention here, and I'm mentioning this one first for all of you who opened this list to see something about MediaWiki. To you I say: here's an alternative; take it. Take it, damn you!

DokuWiki, along with MediaWiki, is software designed to run on a server. Now, this *can* be done on your own local computer using something like [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/), for instance, but if you're going to go the whole nine yards here and set up a wiki server locally, do yourself a favor and consider doing it on a real server.

Why? Portability, that's why. A wiki hosted on a server means you can access and edit your notes from any device with a web browser. Now, you can do that in a more limited capacity with TiddlyWiki or WoaS, but remember, Java is a requirement, and not all devices play nice with that. If you choose to self-host a wiki, you could edit that shit from your phone, your tablet, everything. Simply put, it's a *pretty neat thing*. But it is something that takes a significant amount of time and effort to set up (and more importantly, secure), so don't leap all over this idea unless you're already familiar with server administration.

However, for those of you who find DokuWiki, MediaWiki, or any other server-side wiki software *so good* that you just *have to have it*, I may do a tutorial on setting up a local server if there's any interest.

Anyway, back to DokuWiki. What makes it a better solution than MediaWiki? It's lightweight, it's simpler to set up, and best of all, it uses [very similar syntax](https://www.dokuwiki.org/wiki:syntax). As an added bonus, it stores wiki pages as flat files that any system can easily read. So, for example, if you set up DokuWiki to sync with your Dropbox or Google Drive (and why wouldn't you? Backups are *great*!) any device that could access those files could also read them. It's pretty neat!

Beyond that, it's been a while since I've last used DokuWiki and I have to say it's a lot better looking than the last time I checked on the project. Maybe have a look at the [feature list](https://www.dokuwiki.org/features) and see if this is the wiki for you.

Edit: Also check out [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in/) ([Mercurial repo](http://hg.moinmo.in/)), another easy-to-use wiki project with similar features, but written in Python rather than PHP. Honestly my experiences with both have bled together so much, some of what I've discussed here may be more relevant with MoinMoin than DokuWiki, but either way, both are worth a look before moving on to MediaWiki.

####MediaWiki
Here it is. The wiki software everyone is most familiar with, and the wiki software that you probably shouldn't be using.

Yes, Wikipedia uses it. Wikipedia is also *freakin huge* and has a team of developers (paid by your generous donations to Jimmy Wales's ugly mug every year) to deal with backups, upgrading, and technical issues. Chances are, you aren't prepared to deal with any of those things, at least not without getting paid.

The initial installation of [MediaWiki](https://mediawiki.org) ([github](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-core)) isn't *terrible*, but you will encounter red links out the wazoo for pages you don't care about (a copyright notice, for example) and it's not immediately apparent how to customize *anything* (hint: nine times out of ten it involves scrolling through [Special:Allmessages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Allmessages) for a few hours). It's decently user-friendly for, well, users, but for administrators it's a nightmare &amp;mdash; and as the person installing it, that administrator is *you*. Plus, if you're running it locally, it puts stress on your computer (Apache and mySQL partying in your RAM night and day) that it doesn't deserve. I don't care how mean it's been to you, it doesn't deserve MediaWiki.

Then there's the matter of backups. Backups are *important*, you guys. TiddlyWiki creates local backups automatically, plus it's extremely easy to back up with your favorite cloud-based solution if you so choose. Same deal with WikidPad, sync that up with gDrive and you're set. Hell, it's even relatively easier to back up DokuWiki because the files are easy to locate and copy. For MediaWiki, you'd have to do a mySQL database dump, which is every bit as pleasant as taking a regular dump. And that's half the battle &amp;mdash; good luck restoring that in case something goes wrong. Plus, the whole idea of running a database locally on your computer just so the web server also running locally on your computer can communicate with it rubs me the wrong way.

Don't get me wrong. MediaWiki is great for large collaborative projects, but a private wiki isn't any of those things. Don't do it!

###Conclusion
In conclusion... [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/). That is my conclusion for you. Give it a shot. Also, keep in mind there are many other great ways to keep track of notes than a wiki, like [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), or [Catch](https://catch.com/), or a [Google document](https://drive.google.com/), or hell, a notepad and paper.

Our conventional understanding of creativity and the creative arts is that you are either born with an affinity for them, or you aren’t. That is, some people are more ‘talented’ than others, and if you don’t have the talent you may as well give up. Purporting this idea is the fact that, most of the time, we only ever really see the artist's finished work - the complete painting, the final draft of the story or the stage performance of the dance. We look at it and say “Wow, I could never come up with anything like that! They must be a million times more talented than me!”, without realising that the painting took countless sleepless nights, the story was re-written three or four times and the play was rehearsed for months. 

Those of us not blessed with this innate ‘talent’ from an early age begin to form some very warped ideas about creativity and the creative process. We start to think that ‘creativity’ is an ethereal quality almost like a fairy godmother. If you’ve got it, you are blessed with idea after idea which, once acquired, simply flow from you, entirely perfect the first time around, with hardly any effort required on your part. If you don’t got it, then sorry, but the creative arts aren’t for you. 

What many fail to realise, however, is that creativity is much more about science than it is about magic. In all of the arts, there are techniques that work better than others, and those who we see as ‘talented’ simply have a more intuitive understanding of which is which. A lot of what we do in subjects like English and Art is analysing what those techniques are and how well the writer or artist uses them. 

I’m sure many of you are itching to tell me that writers and artists don’t think about which techniques they’re using. You’d probably be right - most of the time I don’t think they do. That doesn’t mean they aren’t using them, though, just that they’re doing so instinctively, the same way a sporty person might hold a tennis racquet correctly first-time, while someone else would have to be shown. 

Because of this it is entirely likely that literary critics and analysts would come up with insights into the art that the writer or artists themselves didn’t even think of when creating the work. Not because they aren’t there, though - because the artist is past the stage of needing to consciously apply the technique in question. 

What does this mean for all of us non-creative types, then? Sure, some might look at it and say that we’re at a disadvantage to those who have an intuitive understanding of what they’re doing, but in that regard nothing has changed. What does change when we realise that creativity is a science is our perceptions of our own potential. Simply put, we can be creative too, all we need to do is understand the process behind good creation. 

Our misunderstandings of the creative process stem from our misconceptions about what drives it. Ask people what begins and finishes a novel, and most will tell you that it’s inspiration. You get this great idea and start writing about it, and staying excited about the idea helps you to finish. Inspiration, according to them, leads to determination. 

The reality is that it actually works the other way around. 

If you sit around waiting for a good idea to hit you - as many people do - you’re going to be waiting a very long time. That’s because you aren’t putting yourself in a creative mindset (by which I mean a state of mind where you are creating things). Creation breeds creation, and inspiration is the creation of new ideas. Similarly, one isn’t inspired to create 100% of the time during their project - it probably isn’t even anywhere near 50%. Creation isn’t easy - every second of the way, the voice in the back of your head is busy trying to wreck your self-esteem - telling you you aren’t good enough, that it’s a bad idea, that you should give up, give it a rest and start again. 

It isn’t inspiration that gets you to start or to finish a book. It’s you telling yourself “I want to write this book, I will finish this painting,” and not letting yourself give up until you do. 

Creativity, then isn’t about the inspired application of creative magics as it is about determinately the science of what works, what doesn’t and applying that.

What this means is that creation is for everyone - it’s not something you’re born or blessed with, it’s something you can learn to do as much as Van Gogh or Tolkien, if not as well. The conclusion, then, is that if you want to create then stop lamenting about how creative you wish you were.

I'll be your host again this morning, standing until the moderators are available. What is a word war, you ask? I'm so glad you asked.

A wordwar is a bit of friendly competition to encourage you to get writing done. Two or more people write whatever they want for a certain amount of time (usually 30 minutes per war) and report how many words they've written at the end. Whoever writes the most words ""wins,"" but of course it's not really about that, it's about getting you writing.

For those of you who weren't around yesterday, /u/lophyte took off work to get some writing done and decided to challenge everyone to continuous 30-minute word wars between 9am-2pm Eastern time. /u/kalez238 suggested he make a post here about it, at which point I suggested /u/lophyte put his proverbial balls to the proverbial wall and [post it on /r/writing](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/108z7l/all_day_word_wars_today_in_the_shutupandwrite/).

It was a rousing success. Tons of new people showed up and participated in what would turn out to be the [second most active day in #shutupandwrite ever](http://shutupandwrite.net/ircstats/). Once /u/lophyte left I took over as best as I could while still actually working at the same time. Between us, the word war went on pretty much *all day*.

I can't speak for the other participants, but I definitely am surprised with how much I accomplished yesterday.

So I think we should do this again sometime. Namely, next week. On Saturday. Unfortunately there's pretty much no way to repeat this on Fridays unless /u/lophyte starts using up a lot of vacation days, but Saturdays are totally in. I'll be warring from around 10am to whenever the wars die down with, hopefully, a few people available to host a war or two when I have to eat or something :)

Glad to see you're still subscribed to our little writing subreddit experiment! I know it's been a bit slow around here lately, but that's what happens when your community is devoted to intelligent, thoughtful, and most importantly, well-written posts. It is also what happens when the head mod decides to be lazy for a month just because he has a job now or something silly like that.

But fear not! I have some *important announcements* to make about the month ahead! Do I mean from now until the end of September or 30 days from now? That depends on how quickly everything will get done and once we know that answer we can just pretend I was more specific here.

**Subreddit redesign!**

You're lookin' at it. Well, mostly. There's still a lot of little changes to be made and whatnot, of course. CSS and I don't get along very well, so it's taken a while. For the record, our current design is heavily inspired by /r/circlebroke, a subreddit I don't read but nevertheless has one beautiful layout.

**More sidebar links!**

Yeah this one's a work in progress, but it's a large part of why I prettyfied the subreddit. Before our list of resources took up a bunch of space and was just kinda chillin' there. But with our fancy popout menus we can add as many resources and subreddits as we want! *And we will.*

**An actual FAQ!**

I can't believe it either! Our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/shutupandwrite) now contains questions, though I'm not sure if they are so much Frequently Asked, but one out of three ain't bad.

**A daily prompt subreddit!**

Soon, very soon, we'll be launching Reddit's first fully automated prompt subreddit. All credit for the awesome code behind this goes to /u/Laogeodritt. I could take the credit but I actually didn't do anything for this and then he'd probably just program his bot to call me a butt.

With your help we're aiming to make this the most consistent prompt subreddit *of all time*. The bot will update once a day every day at exactly the same time based on suggestions left in (what else?) suggestion threads.

If you just can't wait and want to check out examples of writing prompts we've linked a few in the sidebar. /r/writingprompts and /r/promptoftheday are both awesome manually-run prompt communities.

**A wiki of writing resources and essays!**

Those of you who checked out the ""FAQ"" before might remember it was actually just a list of links to useful posts. Well, that list is coming back in an even more organized form. The Reddit wiki launch is [slightly delayed](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/zs4qc/moderators_wiki_launch_is_delayed_slightly/) as of now, but once the admins get that feature worked out we'll be jumpin' on it to create a list of all the awesome /r/shutupandwrite posts you probably didn't even know existed.

**Ice cream for everyone!**

Still working on this. I'm pretty sure there's a CSS3 attribute for it somewhere.

As always, it's great to have you here (yes, even you) and I wish you the best of luck on your writing. Now shut up and get back to it :)",Meta,False,,t5_2u32d,1347631557.0,,,True,t3_zvkb0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/zvkb0/awesome_stuff_coming_up/,moderator
1344308587.0,15,self.shutupandwrite,xsxmo,An argument against crowdsourced critique,17,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/xsxmo/an_argument_against_crowdsourced_critique/,"For months, or maybe years, Andrew Hussie's *MS Paint Adventures* ran exclusively on fan suggestions. That is to say, the readers helped run the story by giving commands to the characters. It was a successful experiment that Hussie somehow managed to craft into a cohesive narrative despite readers tugging it in every possible direction at once.

Then, partway through his latest story, he stopped taking suggestions. In typical Hussian fashion, he wrote a long, detailed, and humorous explanation as to how he arrived at this decision. But one struck me in particular, one that I never would've thought of: as the number of suggestions grew, Hussie could simply scroll through the (pages and pages of) suggestions to find the direction *he* wanted the story to take.

In effect, the more suggestions his work received, the less difference there was between taking suggestions and having *no feedback at all*.

Crowdsourced critique works similarly. When you post a work to a public forum &amp;mdash; say, Reddit &amp;mdash; you receive anonymous or nearly-anonymous feedback from people. Well, you assume they're people. Could be robots for all you know. Even if they are people, you don't know their background. Maybe they're out to confuse and befuddle you, or maybe they're in such a good mood that they miss your flaws entirely. You just don't know.

Even in a perfect scenario where you received tons upon tons of feedback &amp;mdash; not just any feedback, but *thoughtful* feedback from level-headed people born with a biological inability to tell a lie &amp;mdash; crowdsourced critique becomes useless. Aside from the very real problems of some critiques directly contradicting one another, there's also a human element to it. Specifically, you. With that much feedback, no matter how careful and unbiased you may try to be, you will start to consider some critiques to be more accurate and others to be less accurate. After all, what else can you do when faced with so much information, especially information that tends to contradict itself? Eventually you'll be left with an overall impression similar to the one you expected when you first posted your piece - for example, if you expected negative feedback, you'll remember the negative feedback, regardless of whether or not that feedback really applied.

This is one of the main problems I see with crowdsourced critique. Even in the impossibly perfect situation where everyone only posted only well thought-out critiques, it *still* wouldn't work.

More often than not, however, crowdsourced critique runs into the opposite problem - too little feedback. Because there is so little information, one is inclined to consider at least *some* of it to be important and relevant, when in fact *none* of it may be. Again, you still don't know anyone's background. Do they really understand what you were trying to accomplish? Even if they did, are their problems with your work truly representative of a larger population? Are they in your target audience? Should you *care* what they have to say? The answer to most of these is: probably not.

There's a further problem with crowdsourced critique, and that's the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). People who think they are awesome will disregard negative critique, and people who think they are shit will disregard positive critique, when in fact those people are typically the opposite of how they perceive themselves to be. As a result, you've got a massive percentage of the population who simply will not change their minds about their own writing skill even when faced with massive evidence to the contrary.

Why is particularly a problem with crowdsourced critique? Because in crowdsourced critique, there is no prior relationship between the writer and the critic. Therefore, there ~~is no *trust*~~ can be no *meaningful communication* between the writer and the critic - any critique can be disregarded for any reason without much thought. If the person critiquing your writing is someone you've met and had prior discussions with, even just online, the weight their opinion holds is truly different than if they were another anonymous poster on the Internet.

More importantly, crowdsourced critique robs the writer and critic of the chance to have a *conversation*. I think this is absolutely a vital part of any critique. To provide the best feedback, the critic has to understand what the writer was attempting to do. Ideally, of course, the piece should speak for itself, but if it doesn't, that's a problem that needs fixing &amp;mdash; and it can only be fixed if the critic understands the author's aim. Otherwise, it's left for people to puzzle over in the comment section, which doesn't get the writer anywhere, and a lot of energy is wasted.

And this is why* you won't see crowdsourced critique on /r/shutupandwrite, but critique is allowed and encouraged in our realtime chat. There's a world of difference between one-on-one feedback and crowdsourcing a piece. Though I will give Reddit some credit, at least &amp;mdash; crowdsourcing anything will get your spelling and grammar corrected something fast.

Do you like critique? Do you like people being judgmental assholes on the Internet? If so, here's your chance to submit to the critiquecast!

**What is this nonsense?**  
Exactly what it sounds like: you submit a story and you get a chance to have it read and critiqued on air. If you're looking for informative feedback, turn back now, but if you're looking for your writing to be unfairly mocked for the greater good, you've come to the right place! If you impress us enough, you might be this cycle's winner of **Reddit Gold.** We still don't know what that does, but we do know it will make you feel unique and special.

**The prompt**
&gt; Write a story that contains a dream sequence. Try and avoid the ""It was all a dream"" twist at the end, as it's entirely too predictable when the whole point of the prompt is to contain a dream sequence. 

**Submission guidelines**

* Maximum submission length: 1200 words.
* Submissions should be in a Google doc. (Please convert .doc or .docx files to proper Google documents!)
* You must submit to the call for submissions thread on /r/shutupandwrite, as that is where the voting on submissions will take place. Obviously voting won't work if the submissions are scattered around different subreddits!
* Submissions are due by Midnight EST on Sunday August 11th.

**Voting guidelines**  
If we get more than six responses from this prompt, your votes will help us decide which ones get on the show. We're asking you to vote for the submissions you think would be the most interesting to hear. How you define ""interesting"" is up to you, of course :)

**Want to submit your own audio critique?**  
If you want to critique a piece that we have missed in the previous cycles (not the microfiction one, we'll be doing all of those!) feel free to submit your own audio critique in the style of the podcast as a reply to the submission.

Please remember that /r/shutupandwrite is not a text critique sub &amp;mdash; there are plenty of places with a monopoly on *that* already &amp;mdash; so standard text-only critiques are not allowed! (You could always PM the author on your own time, of course!)

Plus, if your audio critique is well-done and in the style of the critiquecast (unforgivingly honest) we will include it as a guest episode. How about that?

Yes, finally. Yes, it's been two months. Yes, we're a little bit more on top of things now.

**What is [the Critiquecast](http://shutupandwrite.net/category/critiquecast/)?**

We are a group of amateur writers who got together and decided to critique others' writing on the air. It's not meant to be a serious critique (*amateur* writers, remember); it's more so to give you the experience of hearing your writing read aloud by an unforgiving and unfair audience.

For this cycle we will be picking **six** stories to critique on the air. How? You're going to tell us which ones, that's how. The official submission thread in /r/shutupandwrite will be put into Contest Mode for the duration of the week, and whatever ones you want to see critiqued, you can upvote. We have the ultimate say in which ones we will pick to critique, but highly upvoted stories will be given more consideration.

Recordings speak louder than words:

* [26. A Cut Below](http://shutupandwrite.net/2013/05/20/critiquecast-026-a-cut-below/)
* [14. People McNuggets](http://shutupandwrite.net/2013/04/01/critiquecast-14-people-mcnuggets/)
* [12. Breakfast with a Boner](http://shutupandwrite.net/2013/03/24/critiquecast-012-breakfast-with-a-boner/)

**THE PROMPT**
&gt; The main character realizes that he/she brought the wrong one. No, that's not a typo. You're supposed to fill in the wrong *what* (or *who* or *whatever*) with your imagination.

**Submission guidelines**

* Maximum submission length: 1,200 words. Bonus points if you keep it to 1,000.
* Submissions must be in the form of a Google doc.
* Submissions *must* be on the /r/shutupandwrite thread, otherwise voting's going to be a headache for everyone involved.
* Submissions are due on MIDNIGHT EST, Sunday, June 9th.

**Voting guidelines**

Vote for whatever stories you'd like to see critiqued on the show! A few days after submissions end, we'll announce which six we're going to critique. Unfortunately that means we might be neglecting a few stories, so feel free to submit your own audio critiques as replies to the submitter. Anything that's well-done and in the style of the critiquecast (unprofessional and blatantly unfair) may be selected as a bonus episode to go up whenever we feel like it.

**Reddit Gold**

The arbitrarily selected ""winner"" of this cycle of the critiquecast will be awarded Reddit Gold. That's about all there is to it.

We will begin streaming in about 15-20 minutes after we copypasta the submissions into new documents (no editing!)

Do you like contests? Do you like critique? Do you like people being smartasses on the internet? Here is a chance at all of those things!

Submit a response to this prompt and your story will be read aloud, live, on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/critiquecast exactly 24 hours from now. The critiquers in question have no claim to expertise in writing and will relentlessly snark at just about anything. So what's the point, you ask? Well, here are some reasons blatantly copied from the last post about this:

* Hearing one's writing read aloud can help you pinpoint awkward wording.
* You'll get a realtime reaction to your story and possibly some insight into the thought processes of readers.
* Pacing issues are more easily identifiable when a story is read aloud.
* You will hear an interpretation of your story's tone, rather than the tone in your own head.
* It's fun! (For us at least.)

Here are the rules:

* Submissions must be in the form of a publicly viewable Google document, linked from a comment either on this thread or [the thread in /r/writing](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17pj39/respond_to_this_prompt_for_a_free_critique_and_a/).
* Submissions should aim to be 2,000 words long, but there is a hard limit of 2,500 words.
* Submissions *must* be received before **Saturday, February 2nd at 2PM EST**, that is, **exactly 24 hours from the time of this post** (to prevent other timezones from having too much of an unfair advantage or disadvantage). Anything submitted after this time period will not be considered.
* The winner of Reddit Gold, should there be one, will be arbitrary as all hell but the reasons why will be discussed on the air. There are no objective criteria besides the submission criteria already listed here.

###The prompt

Get your stories to us by **Friday, March 29th @ Midnight EST** and get a chance for your stories to be critiqued live and, possibly, a chance at Reddit Gold too. Whatever that does.

###The Critiquecast
We are a group of people from /r/shutupandwrite who, every Sunday, go on air in an attempt rip apart your stories in as sarcastic and blatantly unfair of a manner as possible. While there have been some incidents of accidental earnestness and fairness, and potentially even *usefulness*, we are mostly here to chill out and have a good time reading stuff.

You can check out our previous episodes on [Mixcloud](http://mixcloud.com/critiquecast) or, sometime soon, iTunes! I just have to actually get us on there first.

We'll be making a separate announcement when we're ready to go live, but it will be on Sunday, 2PM EST, at http://ustream.tv/channel/critiquecast.

###The Prompt
This week, write a story that takes place in a minute. That is to say, from the start of the story to the end of the story, a minute will have passed in the world the story takes place in. Creativity is encouraged. A single character spending that entire minute pondering a philosophical question or something else equally *not-entertaining* is discouraged.

* **Word Count:** We have a strict 1,500 word maximum to prevent us from being stuck reading really long stories. There is no word *minimum*, though, so feel free to give us some flash fiction, microfiction, stuff like that. Just don't be a smartass and give us a fortune cookie, and we'll all be good.
* **Format:** Since we'll be rehosting these stories in Google Docs, a properly converted, publicly viewable Google document is highly preferred. (That does mean you actually *convert* your files accordingly, not just upload a .docx and call it good.) You could submit something else, but I will hate you a bit for it. Unless it's plaintext, in which case, hugs &lt;3
* **Submit To:** The comment section in this thread. We're going to make your writing public anyway, so you've got nothing to lose by putting it here.
* **Submit By:** As it says at the top, midnight EST on Friday of next week. The earlier we get your stuff, the earlier we're likely to read it, though.

Write on, and remember to follow [@critiquecast](http://twitter.com/critiquecast) for updates!

I like to make sure I write at least 1,000 words a day, and I want to keep myself accountable. I also want to see the days where I really failed so that I can try to improve.

To help out with that, I've made [this spreadsheet](http://goo.gl/Iog0O) to help track my efforts, and I thought some others might see some utility in it, too. So far, it has:

-Fields for daily entry of Words written, Time Spent Writing (in minutes), and Words/Hour

On the second sheet, it has some basic stat tracking, such as:

-Total Words Written

-Average Words/Day

-Highest Daily Total

-Total Hours Spent writing

-Average Hours/Day Spent writing

-Highest Daily Words/Hour

Hopefully it'll be useful to people who like to visualize when they're most productive, or maybe they're just obsessive about the amount of work they're doing to see where they can improve.

Right now, it's sort of a beta release. I'm not that great in Excel and this sort of tested my limits of knowledge. If you have any improvements you can make to it, please share them here. I figured that I could lay the groundwork, and maybe some of the Excel pros in the community could build on my work and make this an awesome thing everyone in the sub could use.

Some changes I'd like to see implemented but am way too dumb in Excel to execute:

-Pretty charts showing progress

-Ways to show most words written per week, month, quarter, etc.

-A 'Word Debt' counter...you set an amount you'd like to write during a week/month/year, and it calculates how far behind you are to make that amount by the deadline (maybe too advanced for Excel, I'm not sure)

**Where:** The Internet. More specifically, Reddit and Ustream. Less specifically, Earth.

**How:** Do.

**What:** As some of you may know, or may not know, SU&amp;W isn't a Reddit-only community. We also have an [IRC channel](http://reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/wiki/irc) and a somewhat less-than-public TeamSpeak server where, amongst a lot of silly bullshit, we do critiques of each others' writing.

""Critical Strike"" is a writing contest that harnesses the snarkitude of our TeamSpeak critique group. It's a chance to get your work critiqued live by a bunch of slightly sarcastic, completely underqualified writers who, with any luck, will give you some feedback you might just barely be able to do something with. It's also a chance at Reddit Gold under the most arbitrary conditions ever.

**What.** Okay, so here's how it works. On February 1st, at exactly 2PM EST, a writing prompt will be posted on /r/shutupandwrite (and possibly /r/writing). All participants will then have exactly 24 hours to write a response to said prompt of a length of about 2,500 words (but absolutely no more than 3,000 words).

Then, starting February 2nd, again at exactly 2PM EST, we will begin reading the submitted pieces aloud on a Ustream channel I haven't quite registered yet. As we read along, we will do our best to give useful feedback on the piece in question. Failing that, we will attempt to give *entertaining* feedback. Failing that, /u/wallmani will come on and sing us the song of his people.

If any entries manage to impress the critiquers enough, the ""winner"" will be awarded Reddit Gold.

**Why?:** Because it's fun. None of us are professional writers or editors. This is basically the [MST3k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000) equivalent for writing.

What I can say is that you will get the opportunity to see the average reader's response to your style, and despite our tendency to quip about such things as unclear sentence structure and adjectival abuse, some misguided souls have already called our live critiques ""helpful.""*

But really that's all beside the point. First and foremost this is an experiment. We are basically opening up the TeamSpeak server to the world for a few hours and just seeing what happens. The potential for awesome is there, but will awesome be within our grasp?? There is only one way to find out. That way is *tuning in*.

Watch for the prompt on Friday and get to writin'!

In response to this week’s challenge to post stuff to Shut Up &amp; Write that make me a better writer, I suggest emulation. 

The most vivid example I can devise from my own life was a brief foray into art.  I tried a while to sketch pictures, etc, but I’m no artist and I didn’t particularly like what I was sketching.  But then I came across grunge art watercolor by [lora zombie](http://lorazombie.com/) and other watercolor by [agnes-cecile](http://agnes-cecile.deviantart.com/) and honestly all I wanted to do was copy them.  Although [I’m still no artist](http://i.imgur.com/u5fHo.jpg), my attempts at watercolor using methods I observed in their art was far better than anything I would have done otherwise.  And I’m slowly starting to adopt a particular style.

This can be applied to writing. When I read Harry Potter, I’m generally not reading as a writer.  I love the plot and storyline behind the books, but J.K. Rowling’s style doesn’t call out to me as something I want to write.  But when I read [George Saunder’s Sea Oak](http://www.barcelonareview.com/20/e_gs.htm), there’s something about his style that makes me want to write just like him.  Or when I read any poem by Margaret Atwood, particularly [Manet’s Olympia](http://biblioklept.org/2008/05/23/manets-olympia-by-margaret-atwood), I’m jealous because I wish I had written it.

Unlike other areas of life, if you’ve felt jealousy while reading a story, then that’s a *good sign*.  You can begin to form the *foundation of your style*.  Immediately after reading a novella by George Saunders, I tried to throw some of him in while I wrote a short story.  The improvement of my writing increased far more so than it did with any other tactic. And the beautiful thing about writing is that no matter how much of a particular style you borrow, it won’t be plagiarism because your story will be different.  As long as you keep reading different things that strike a chord with you, you will always be changing your style until you become a hodgepodge of your experiences. And that’s when you’ll truly be unique.

On a completely unrelated note, while I was researching relevant videos for this post, I came across George Saunders giving a talk about [identity in writing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3SpooNt3Ms&amp;feature=related). The video starts with Saunders discussing the role of writers in today’s culture, but then he goes into what we put of ourselves into writing, and even if we just influence a few other people, it’s worth it. Start watching about 4:20 (haha).

**TL;DR** Steal shit to get better. &amp; George Saunders rocks.

It is important to set a limit on yourself for this exercise.

Take an empty chair and set it where you can see it, facing you. Now, take the next 5 minutes (yes, on a timer), and describe the person or being that is sitting in that chair. 

Male or female? How old? Hair colour? Eye colour? Outstanding physical attribute? What is the expression on the person's face? What do the person's clothes look like? Visible disabilities or deformities? Wrinkles? Jewellry? Tattoos? Is the person fat or skinny? Short or tall? Muscular? Is he or she well-educated or not? Does the person have pockets? What's in them? Does the person have a purse or a bag? What's in it? How much money do they keep in their wallet? etc. . .

After your timer has gone off, read over what you've written and ask yourself how this person got there. You may find you've invented a storyline almost unconsciously as you try to answer as many questions as you can within the time limit.

This is to answer or at least provide a jumping-off point for some of the common questions beginner writers have, and to prevent the subreddit from getting flooded with the same questions over and over again as we grow larger.

We'll start off simple with the question **""Should I outline or freewrite?""** The obvious answer to that, like many other writing questions, is that it depends on what works for you personally. But let's not stop there; what examples, advice, resources, etc. would you give to someone for either method?

----

**Notes so far**

* Generally, some pre-planning is helpful. Some writers write without any pre-planning at all, but they are the exception, not the rule.
* An outline is useful to prevent getting stuck.
* Striking a balance between outlining too much and too little is important, and one you will find over time, judging by how often you get stuck vs. pants a completely new plotline.
* Not every story requires the same level of preparation. For example, you're more likely to benefit from outlining a longer piece than a shorter one.

* [The Guide](http://theguide.sourceforge.net/)
* Google Docs
* Scrivener

1371359488.0,11,self.shutupandwrite,1gfusz,What We Can Learn From the The Red Wedding's Emotional Punch,18,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1gfusz/what_we_can_learn_from_the_the_red_weddings/,"* **Spoiler Warning:** The following post talks about the “The Red Wedding” scene from the television series Game of Thrones; in particular, season 3 episode 9. If you haven’t caught up to that point in the show, please set this blog post aside until you have.

There are very few characters in *Game of Thrones* that I like.

The cast is wide and broad and spans multiple continents and a dozen plotlines, but I can count the number of characters whom I truly care about and root for on a single hand: Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Davos Seaworth, Lord Varys, and Ser Barristan Selmy. A special mention goes out to the Hound, Sandor Clegane.

Robb, Talisa, and Catelyn Stark are not on that list, yet the Red Wedding hit me just as hard as it did the watchers who loved those characters. Interesting, isn’t it?

In fact, I’ve been rather bored with the Robb-Talisa storyline ever since they got together and Catelyn Stark always felt too impulsive and short-sighted for me to respect. Sure, I understand all of their motivations for what they do and I can sympathize, but I didn’t like them.

Yet when The Scene played out before me and ended with those silent credits, I found myself speechless with goosebumps prickling across my skin. I was confused. Stunned. Even angry. Did that *really* just happen on my TV screen? I mean, what? Did I *really* just watch *three* main characters get slaughtered?

It’s been two weeks since the episode aired but I’ve only just managed to (somewhat) sort out the reasons for why that scene hits with such impact, even for someone like me who didn’t even like the ones who died. Boiled down, it’s actually quite simple.

**The power of the Red Wedding rests in the fact that it shatters two of the most basic aspects of what it means to be human: trust and hope.**

In the books (which I haven’t read) prior to the Red Wedding, Martin built up an in-world custom that involved bread and salt. When a guest eats and drinks under the roof of a host, both guest and host enter a sacred covenant that neither shall harm the other for the duration of the guesting. This is the invocation of guest right and we saw this happen on screen, but sadly it wasn’t explained until the next episode.

But the episode built up this idea of trust in other ways. Robb Stark made his apologies and the Freys seemed to accept his remorse. Walder Frey offered up one of his more beautiful daughters to Edmure Tully, which made us think that all is right between them. Plus, the sprinkling of humor here and there was brilliant misdirection for defusing tension. Maybe the Starks and Freys were on good terms now. Trust established.

And then the massacre from out of nowhere.

Betrayal is a universal emotion. We all know what it feels like to trust and have that trust ignored, exploited, or broken. It cuts at one of the deepest issues we have as humans: insecurity. When betrayed, we immediately lose our sense of security and it hurts. Bad.

In fact, betrayal is such a strong emotion that it hurts us even when we see another being betrayed. When two people enter an agreement of trust and one turns on the other, we can’t help but share in the victim’s pain because it reminds us of all the times our own trusted friends and family members have turned on us.

Well, at the Red Wedding, we experienced betrayal on two levels. We watched as the characters on screen were betrayed AND we ourselves felt betrayed by the writers. We believed that these three characters were main characters, and in the world of conventional storytelling main characters don’t die. We trusted that they would live until the end and triumph. They didn’t.

But it doesn’t end there.

Throughout the Red Wedding, we also saw through the eyes of Arya. Here’s a girl who’s been fighting for two seasons to reunite with her family from whom she was separated just after witnessing her father’s execution. During those two seasons, she’s had her life threatened and she’s lost her closest friends, Hot Pie and Gendry. She’s got nothing now.

And she’s come so close to that reunion that she so desperately wanted. From a distance, she could see the encampment as they celebrated and she knew that she was less than a day away from seeing her mother and brother again, but a part of her remained fearful that they’d somehow slip through her fingers at the last moment.

Unfortunately for her, the worst case scenario in her mind was that they’d get up and leave before she could catch up to them.

Hope is another powerful emotion that drives us. It helps us to weather the storms and to endure the night because it promises sunny skies on the other side if we just persevere long enough. Hope gives us something when we have nothing. The world would be a terrible place if we had nothing for which to hope.

So when Arya arrives at camp only to see her family and her family’s bannermen being slaughtered, we can’t help but be crushed. We remember the times when we’ve had our own hopes yanked out from under us and we remember how much it hurts to have the scales peeled from our eyes to reveal that we really had nothing all along.

The other aspects of the Red Wedding—like the gruesome violence and the implications for other plotlines—only serve to amplify these two base yet powerful violations. You don’t have to like Robb, Talisa, Catelyn, or Arya, but when they experience the breaking of trust and the loss of hope, coupled with the finality of death, we have no choice but to share in their pain and mourn with them.",Inspiration,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-inspiration,,True,t3_1gfusz,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1gfusz/what_we_can_learn_from_the_the_red_weddings/,

It’s cute, in a kind of naïve way, I suppose. But I am going to make this very, very clear. Just in case you didn’t read the topic heading (in which case, why the fuck are you here?)

You cannot struggle against an idea.

You can rage against it, in a way. You can write scathing blogs, go to rallies, support ‘awareness groups’, join eight different clubs trying to eradicate *the idea you don’t agree with*. But in the end, what are you actually doing?

Bitching.

I do not want to read 300 pages of your bitching. 

You want to make a point about how *the idea you don’t agree with* is wrong? You need something to embody that idea. You need someone who takes that idea and acts on it, counter to the protagonist (yes, that is what the prefix anti means. Funny how that works out, isn’t it?). You need your character to have someone try to get in their way. Have a problem with a materialistic culture? Your antagonist must embody that culture. Hell, could probably even be a caricature of it.  There’s a world of difference between an internal monologue of a guy walking down the street thinking to himself how much everyone’s so obsessed with their smartphones, and a group of preppy upstarts who confront the guy and belittle him for not having one. If you can’t see the difference between an internalized bitching session and an actual conflict between characters, writing may not actually be for you right now. 

Still confused? Here’s some examples.

**Bitching**: Book opens to a very poignant and overly lengthy description of the protagonist’s very bare and minimal living quarters, frugal spending habits. He goes out and thinks about how bad people are who have expensive clothes and cars and don’t like him. He goes home and is very happy with his lifestyle and hopes everyone else suffers ill fortune because their choice is not the same as his, and he’s right, goddamnit. And here’s a lengthy point by point essay on why he’s right. Just in case you didn’t get the message that he’s right.

**Conflict**: The protagonist works for a very important company. All his coworkers talk about is their new cars, houses, etc. They ostracize him because he doesn’t participate. The one time he mentioned his tendencies towards efficiency and frugality, it bit him in the ass. He got looked over for promotion because ‘what do you need the money for? Not like you’ll spend it’. Then the area is hit by a disaster. All those people who had gone into debt can’t make the proper preparations or afford the repair and cleanup they need, but the protagonist can. Does he help the people who kicked him in the ass, accepting that maybe his way isn’t for everyone? Or does he let them suffer, because they should have seen that material goods are useless, and maybe this will make them wise up?

See the difference now? So please, spare us your ramblings from your high horse. If you want to write about how much you hate that idea, go blog it. It’s not novel material.

Prompt subreddits are an awesome resource for writers looking to practice writing regularly and expand their creative ""comfort zone"" without worrying about making things perfect. They are, in essence, there to get you to shut up and write. So how *couldn't* we make one?

However, like anything else SU&amp;W related, /r/TheDailyPrompt is a little bit different. Unlike most manually-run prompt subreddits, this one is run off of [bot power](http://reddit.com/u/DailyPromptBot), courtesy of /u/Laogeodritt. That means exactly one prompt per day, no matter what.

Here's how it works:

1. A suggestion thread is posted once per week.
2. Everyone leaves prompt ideas on the suggestion thread and votes on the suggestions they like.
3. The mods take the highest-rated prompt suggestions that don't suck and stick them into an automated queue.
4. New prompts every morning!
5. ???
6. CREATIVITY.

It couldn't be any simpler.* A combination of community involvement, active mods, and automation should keep /r/TheDailyPrompt to a high standard of quality† and consistency.‡ But we need your suggestions to get the ball rolling!

&gt;Hello Mr. Lodato! 
&gt;
&gt;I just read your story P.E. yesterday. My father's partner Steve saved it for me, clipped from the New Yorker. 
&gt;
&gt;I'm a fiction writer too, and I'm working on my ability to end stories properly. It seemed to me when reading P.E. that just as I began to get a grasp on what the story was about, it began to get less and less -- for lack of a better word -- fathomable. 
&gt;
&gt;Is that because the characters are getting more and more high, or is the speaker insane, or going insane, or mad with repressed feelings perhaps? The father mentions he's had ""episodes"" before.
&gt;
&gt;I searched for some interviews with you in hopes that you'd already answered this question, but they seem to all be about Mathilda Savitch, which I intend to read as well. 
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I won't be offended if you don't have time to answer this. Congrats on your success. I'm a fan! 
&gt;
&gt;I hope to someday also be published as highly!

And his reply:
&gt;Hi James,
&gt;Thanks so much for your kind message.
&gt;I'm glad you read (and liked) P.E.
&gt;
&gt;The story grew stranger and stranger, for me, as I was writing it.  I suppose I was just following Freddy's idiosyncratic way of thinking.  Yes, I would say that, as the end approaches, Freddy is going a bit mad .. though HE might call it a moment of spiritual epiphany.  
&gt;
&gt;I wanted to allow the piece its strangeness, especially at the end .. and let the reader witness  the complicated dynamics between these two men.
&gt;
&gt;Hope that answers you question.
&gt;I would write more .. but I'm just about to hop on a plane!
&gt;
&gt;Good luck with you own work .. and thanks again, for your kindness.
&gt;
&gt;Best,
&gt;

I'm gonna try to keep it a regular thing and get our [FAQ](/r/shutupandwrite/wiki/faq) updated like the original plan was. Sorry for falling behind!

About the FAQ Project:

&gt; The FAQ Project is an attempt to write a comprehensive, informative, and slightly sarcastic FAQ for the SU&amp;W wiki. This is to answer or at least provide a jumping-off point for some of the common questions beginner writers have, and to prevent the subreddit from getting flooded with the same questions over and over again as we grow larger.

This week's topic is **""How can I prevent my writing from being stolen?""** Now, for the most part, it's unrealistic to worry about your writing being stolen by someone else &amp;mdash; it would have to be *pretty damn good writing*, and if that's the case so early on in your career you can always produce more. But what I want to focus on for this FAQ is what **doesn't work**, the stuff that can actually do damage by giving writers a false sense of security. Any *actual* advice on protecting writing is welcome, too, of course!

###The Critiquecast
We are a group of people from /r/shutupandwrite who, every Sunday, go on air in an attempt rip apart your stories in as sarcastic and blatantly unfair of a manner as possible. While there have been some incidents of accidental earnestness and fairness, and potentially even *usefulness*, we are mostly here to chill out and have a good time reading stuff.

You can check out our previous episodes on [Mixcloud](http://mixcloud.com/critiquecast) or, starting next week, iTunes! :O (Yes, *finally*.)

We'll be making a separate announcement when we're ready to go live, but it will be on Sunday, 2PM EST, at http://ustream.tv/channel/critiquecast.

###The Prompt
Write a story in which a sympathetic character dies. The key word here is *sympathetic*. The other key word is *dies*, also, but killing off characters is easy. The hard part is making us give a shit about them before they croak.

* **Word Count:** We have a strict 1,500 word maximum to prevent us from being stuck reading really long stories. There is no word *minimum*, though, so feel free to give us some flash fiction, microfiction, stuff like that. Just don't be a smartass and give us a fortune cookie, and we'll all be good.
* **Format:** Since we'll be rehosting these stories in Google Docs, a properly converted, publicly viewable Google document is highly preferred. (That does mean you actually *convert* your files accordingly, not just upload a .docx and call it good.) You could submit something else, but we may hate you a bit for it. Unless it's plaintext, in which case, hugs &lt;3
* **Submit To:** The comment section in this thread. We're going to make your writing public anyway, so you've got nothing to lose by putting it here.
* **Submit By:** As it says at the top, midnight EST on Friday of next week. The earlier we get your stuff, the earlier we're likely to read it, though.

A wordwar is a bit of friendly competition to encourage you to get writing done. Two or more people write whatever they want for a certain amount of time (usually 30 minutes per war) and report how many words they've written at the end. Whoever writes the most words ""wins,"" but of course it's not really about that, it's about getting you writing.

""Because of this - that.""

""Everything was like this, but then . . .""

My project has been going pretty well over all. Neat concept, neat scenario, neat characters, neat action. However I didn't like the goals of the protagonist. That is to say - I didn't like that there were *two* goals. One of the biggest problems I've had with my project is a unification of action. I rather like the simple-mindedness of the 90's high concept movies in which a character has a single, clearly defined goal that he pursues. I'd had it in mind to make the two goals into one goal. At one point I toyed with the notion of simply making them one ofter the other. So that he has one goal and then the goal switches near the end. That solution didn't please me. Though I kept writing possible draft outlines. You gotta roll the dice, right? 

Until this morning. 

I racked my brains for a solid hour (with much pacing and wringing of hands). Two goals is flatly unacceptable. Even if there are tangents, subplots and what have you, a single goal is really the only clean way to write a story. Two LEGO blocks that don't want to fit together in a singular and elegant form. Those two goals did not want to fit together no matter the combination I tried. I noticed that I was getting upset. I stopped and took a deep breath. And then somehow I remembered (without words, oddly enough) that Matt and Trey once said something about taking out words / phrases like ""and then"" and instead replacing them with ""because"" or ""but then.""  So I took the two goals and put the word ""because"" in between the two goals. 

http://youtu.be/G22X5X49VhM

Within the context of my story there's a character aspect that is key. With the two goals made into one the characters are actually more alive now. Which makes everything better. The action, though physically defined, shows characterization much better now than it did even two days ago. All because of a neat little phrase that a buddy told me in passing as heard from Matt Stone and Trey Parker (not personally, unfortunately).

Those who use it have a running tally of their weekly activities. We can look at our progress and see what we've done, how often we've succeeded, how often we've failed, and how consistent our efforts are. 

Great! So, what can one actually do with that data?

A great deal of things, actually. And doing something with that data will help you identify what reasonable goals ought to be. Do you want to finish a manuscript from page 1 to 'The End' in 3 months? Great! Is that 2K words a week goal going to accomplish that? Hm. That would depend. How long do you want the piece to be? If you plan for it to be over 25K words, chances are you're going to fail. The data simply doesn't agree (2,000 * 12 = 24K, after all).

But it's not just about making your long term and short term goals coincide. It's also about making your goals reasonable. If you set a goal of 1K words a day every week for 8 weeks, and failed to make that goal in 6 of the 8 weeks, maybe it's not a good goal. On the other hand, if you set your goal to 800 words a week and consistently post 3-4K, maybe you should look at being a little more aggressive with your weekly goals. Use the data you have to find reasonable and attainable goals (the SMART goals mentioned in the check in threads). Having a goal that is attainable with some effort will do you more good than coasting through with goals that don't challenge you, or goals that are unattainable given your circumstances. ***Yes, your circumstances are important to making these goals, and don't let anything except the data tell you otherwise.*** 

Your goals should be challenging but not impossible. Track your word counts by session, by day, by week. By whatever variable you find useful to you. A spreadsheet in Google Drive can even give you a nanowrimo-like running tally and graphical representation of your data, if it helps you analyze it. Use it to make sure that what you're planning coincides with the efforts you can put forward- efforts backed by the data you've collected. Let the numbers do the talking. Once your goals and efforts align, you'll find a sweet spot of satisfying productivity. 

Or, you could try and push even further from there. But you can't see how far you've jumped without knowing where you jumped *from*.

This ~~probably~~ definitely should have gone up before the first, but it’s too late now.

Simply put, plot is the pattern the story follows to reach its conclusion. A plot is this: ""Mary Sue and Gary Stu ate berries at a park, then they died because the berries were poisonous."" The elements of plot are limited to things that we can categorize, things that have come before, because when a plot escapes categorization it ceases to provide a meaningful framework for the story. It becomes an abstraction.

The story, on the other hand, is what provides a human-related context to the plot. A more in-depth plot can answer these question: who are Mary and Gary, anyway? What were they doing at the park? Why were they eating those berries? The story is details, concept, theme, character. In the plot, we neither know nor care about these things, but there is potential for us to care. All of the things that create emotion are there. What we need now is flavor, details. Story provides that.

No two concepts are exactly the same, no two characters are mirror images of each other unless one is a direct clone. No two themes are exactly alike, because each writer sees things from a slightly different point of view. All of this is a wordy way of saying that the plot is what provides a reason for the story to continue, a cause-and-effect cycle that creates a line for the story to follow.

A wordwar is a bit of friendly competition to encourage you to get writing done. Two or more people write whatever they want for a certain amount of time (usually 30 minutes per war) and report how many words they've written at the end. Whoever writes the most words ""wins,"" but of course it's not really about that, it's about getting you writing.

Some of these include ""The main characters are supposed to be 1 or 2 years older than the target audience"", ""Don't use accents"" and ""Use   grabbing hooks"". 

If you are writing a idealistic, feel-good novel destined to be a bestseller, go for that particular age gap of a few years older, really. It sets the audience to be enthralled with the hope that, no matter how unrealistic the plot may be, ""when I get older, this is going to happen to me!"". But if you are a writer with faith in where your plot is headed, you are free as the metaphorical winds of writing. 

I recently read *Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close* by Jonathan Safran Foer. It is not a YA or coming-of-age novel, but an adult novel where the protagonist is a nine year old boy. I didn't find myself saying ""I can totally relate to this!"", but that was hardly the point. I'm a teenager, and about as in-the-middle of target age groups as you can get. I recognized the depth of the main character, his flaws, his virtues, and his struggles. I didn't feel that it was difficult to read in the slightest, and took a lot from the book. 

As for accents, I don't find them daunting unless exaggerated, and they can be very insightful to a character's personality. I enthusiastically agree with the post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/x9r5i/hook_line_or_thinker_what_makes_you_read_on/) regarding the topic of hooks.

Telling a story requires consistency, of course, and for the most part, people have no trouble being consistent with who their characters are, what they're saying or what they're doing. But they do seem to have a huge problem with trying to figure out when the story is taking place. Novice writers will typically flit back and forth between past tense and present tense (and in some cases, future tense, but if you do that, just pack it in buddy, you're done anyway). 

The thing is, writers who do this tend to not notice it, even after they've ran through a few drafts of their story.

So here we go, with **A Quick Guide To Verb Tenses**

*Past Tense*

Past tense is the most prevalent way to tell a story, mainly because it is the most natural way to tell a story. Because stories are usually retellings of events that happened a long long time ago in a...well, you get it, most stories are told in the past tense. When you tell your friends about that hot girl you found last night at the club, only to find out she was an undercover cop who wasn't looking to go up to your apartment to look at your collection of Neon Genesis Evangelion figurines, you probably tell the story in the past tense, since it happened in the past. Most novels follow the same guideline, that the narrator(s) tell the story from some point in the future. It's the most common way because it tends to be the best way to do it. It's unobtrusive because as people, we're used to hearing stories in this way.

**Examples**

John **went** down to the store and **bought** a bottle of whiskey because he **felt** like his life **had hit** a new low.

=============================================

*Present Tense*

Present tense is being used more and more in modern storytelling, but it's still in the vast minority compared to novels written in past tense. Because of that it's a little bit more obvious to the reader when you write in present tense, because it's not what they're used to reading. That being said, don't be afraid to use present tense narration, just be aware that it might look a little weird on the page, and you can sometimes fall into a weird trap of it seeming like everything is happening at once, instead of the in the past tense where things are assumed to happen one after another.

**Examples**

John **goes** down to the store and **buys** a bottle of whiskey because he **feels** like his life **is hitting** a new low.

=============================================

*Future Tense*

Come on man, seriously?

**Examples**

John **will go** down to the store and **will buy** a bottle of whiskey because he **will feel** like his life **will be hitting** a new low. John **will kill himself** because he **will be in** a future-tense novel.

=============================================

Now, what verb tense you pick is up to you, but the most important thing you have to do is remember which one you're using. ",Craft,False,,t5_2u32d,1337684785.0,tag-craft,,True,t3_tyqli,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/tyqli/verb_tenses_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and/,

They can easily feel cheap or messy if not written correctly, so I am debating whether or not I want to run with this alternate idea.

The first is some great [rules to follow when writing a flashback](http://www.writingforward.com/news-announcements/guest-posts/the-five-rules-of-writing-flashbacks), and the second mentions some different [techniques that can be used to successfully pull off a flashback](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/flashbacks-books) (though I would NEVER write, or suggest writing, a flashback within a flashback.

As part of the requirements for the class, I’m expected to reflect on what I’ve read and learned. Any old student would probably just do it for class and be done with it, but I found that some of the information in my reading has a very useful purpose in writing- helping to define a character. 

In First, Break All The Rules by Buckingham and Coffman (Cited so I don’t get my ass sued), there’s a chapter on focusing on an employee’s strengths. In order to explain how to do that, the book needed to explain what strengths were and what they looked like. In Appendix B, there’s a list of three Talent Groups- Striving Talents, Thinking Talents, and Relating Talents. As I was reading, it struck me. If these are the things that define real, actual, living and breathing and working people, then this list could be used to define fiction characters too, and make them feel more real. 

But it isn’t all about strengths, either. For every focus, there’s a blind spot. Having a character that excels at all the Thinking Talents runs the risk of being unrealistic. Ones that have no talents run the risk of feeling wooden, fake, or unmotivated. For each talent the character excels in, he or she should have one that would stymy them. This provides them with meaningful behaviors that both strengthen and weaken them, patterns that they fall into, just like real people do. 

So, think on your character. The list of talents is below. Though it's hardly exhaustive, it does give a place to start. What ones do your main characters have? What ones do they lack or are weak in? How well defined are your characters?

**Striving:**

*Achiever*- A drive that is internal, constant and self-imposed.

*Kinesthetic*- A need to expend physical energy.

*Stamina*- Capacity for physical endurance.

*Competition*- A need to gauge your success comparatively

*Desire*- A need to claim significance through independence, excellent, risk and recognition.

*Competence*- A need for expertise or mastery.

*Belief*- A need to orient your life around certain prevailing values. 

*Mission*- A drive to put your beliefs into action.

*Service*- A drive to be of service to others.

*Ethics*- A clear understanding of right and wrong which guides your actions.

*Vision*- A drive to paint value-based word pictures about the future.

**Thinking:**

*Focus*- An ability to set goals and to use them every day to guide actions.

*Discipline*- A need to impose structure onto life and work.

*Arranger*- an ability to orchestrate

*Work Orientation*- A need to mentally rehearse and review.

*Gestalt*- A need to see order and accuracy.

*Responsibility*- A need to assume personal accountability for your work.

*Concept*- An ability to develop a framework by which to make sense of things.

*Performance Orientation*- A need to be objective and to measure performance.

*Strategic Thinking*- An ability to play out alternative scenarios in the future.

*Business Thinking*- The financial application of the strategic thinking talent.

*Problem Solving*- An ability to think things through with incomplete data.

*Formulations*- An ability to find coherent patterns within incoherent data sets.

*Numerical*- An affinity for numbers.

*Creativity*- An ability to break existing configurations in favor of more effective/appealing ones. 

**Relating:**

*Woo*- A need to gain the approval of others.

*Empathy*- An ability to identify the feelings and perspectives of others.

*Relator*- A need to build bonds that last.

*Mutirelators*- An ability to build an extensive network of acquaintances.

*Interpersonal*- An ability to purposely capitalize upon relationships. 

*Individualized Perception*- An awareness of and attentiveness to individual differences.

*Developer*- A need to invest in others and to derive satisfaction in doing so.

*Stimulator*- An ability to create enthusiasm and drama.

*Team*- A need to build feelings of mutual respect.

*Positivity*- A need to look on the bright side.

*Persuasion*- An ability to persuade others logically. 

*Command*- An ability to take charge.

*Activator*- An impatience to move others.

*Courage*- An ability to use emotion to overcome resistance.

* Be realistic. Can you *really* snort all that coke in one go? Consider how many brain cells you still have left, and weigh accordingly. Somewhat related, don't set a writing goal that's impossible to achieve.

Anyway, I went ahead and ordered it after discovering that the book started with three reasons why the author should not have written it. I may be a sucker for cynicism.

Mostly I purchased it because I, like so many others who have the same problem as I do, have difficulty writing short fiction. I can happily plot out (and subsequently leave unfinished) a novel- or novella-length story, but the mystical ""short story"" remains firmly out of my grasp.

So I will warn you outright: if the only reason you want to read this book is because you want to learn how to create *short* fiction in particular - well, don't. The author just has a sizable amount of experience in writing short fiction and, I gather, felt better titling his book *Creating Short Fiction* because that's what he wrote the most of.

*Creating Fiction* would have been a more accurate title, frankly, because the tips and techniques discussed within are applicable to all forms of fiction. My breakdown of the book is as follows:

* **Developing Your Talent as a Writer.** Those of you who already have a certain degree of confidence in your writing will find this section the most unhelpful, and it may even discourage you from continuing. But fret not - the book becomes more interesting and detailed as you go on.
* **Idea into Story.** Shit begins to get real in this part. If you have difficulty formulating ideas, or struggle because the ideas you come up with are half-baked and lack a certain degree of depth, this section is for you. You may not agree with his specific terminology, but the way he presents idea formulation is, for the most part, wonderfully logical and interesting. This section also includes a line-by-line breakdown of one of the author's short stories that I confess to having skipped.
* **Beginning a Story.** Highlights of this section include a very convincing argument that viewpoint is more complex than the typical ""first person""/""third person"" categories allow for, as well as a discussion about the ""invisible reader"" and how to keep him or her from getting lost in your story. One of the most interesting statements (for me, anyway) made in the book comes from this section: Knight argues that the minimum number of characters a story can have is three, that is, the author, the reader, and a single in-story character.
* **Controlling a Story.** A section mainly about problems you may run into in the course of telling your story, and a few ideas about how to fix them. This also contains an interesting bit about an author's ""persona"", and suggests that you may create better quality fiction by writing the story not as yourself but *as a more talented writer.*
* **Finishing a Story.** A brief segment about what a good ending should do, and what a writer should do once the story is completed - how to deal with editors, publishers, etc.
* **Being a Writer.** A general mishmash of topics about the life of a writer that didn't seem to fit anywhere else in the book. I didn't agree with all of it, but hey, it's the most subjective section.

All in all, *Creating Short Fiction* gave me a fresh perspective on writing and I'm happy to have read it. I don't really know what else to say here because I'm not a book reviewing kind of person. Uh. Buy it. No seriously, it's like ten bucks. I guarantee you'll find at least a handful of insightful statements that will send you thinking in a different direction.

A Shut Up &amp; Write project*

Do you like critique? Do you like people being judgmental assholes on the Internet? If so, here's your chance to submit to the critiquecast!

**What is this nonsense?**  
Exactly what it sounds like: you submit a story and you get a chance to have it read and critiqued on air. If you're looking for informative feedback, turn back now, but if you're looking for your writing to be unfairly mocked for the greater good, you've come to the right place! If you impress us enough, you might be this cycle's winner of **Reddit Gold.** We still don't know what that does, but we do know it will make you feel unique and special.

**The prompt**
&gt; Write a piece of microfiction (100-200 words) using only monosyllabic words. The only exception from the monosyllabic rule are proper nouns, so as to avoid everyone using characters named Bob, Joe, and whatnot.

**Submission guidelines**

* Maximum submission length: 200 words. It's microfiction, you silly goose! Did you even read the prompt?
* Submissions must be in the form of a Google document or, since it's microfiction, a link to pastebin. We'll put it in a Google document anyway though. So you can't really escape.
* You must submit to the call for submissions thread on /r/shutupandwrite, as that is where the voting on submissions will take place. Obviously voting won't work if the submissions are scattered around different subreddits!
* Submissions are due by Midnight EST on Sunday July 7th.

**Voting guidelines**  
If we get a ridiculous number of responses from this prompt, your votes will help us decide which ones get on the show. We're asking you to vote for the submissions you think would be the most interesting to hear. How you define ""interesting"" is up to you, of course :)

**Want to submit your own audio critique?**  
If we get more submissions to a prompt than we can handle, all submissions that we don't read are considered ""up for grabs,"" and anyone is free to respond to the authors with their own audio critiques. Here are the submissions up for critiquing from the last cycle:

* [""Tailypo"" by /u/rasbperry-19](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1ggsrt/critiquecast_call_for_submissions_8_antihero/caodzbm)
* [""St Paul"" by /u/BluePapaya](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1ggsrt/critiquecast_call_for_submissions_8_antihero/cam4w1x) (This one includes the phrase ""wrinky paper"" if you need convincing)
* [""There's [sic] a Lot of Dads in Hell"" by /u/JE_Smith](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1ggsrt/critiquecast_call_for_submissions_8_antihero/cam9k0f)

Please remember that /r/shutupandwrite is not a text critique sub &amp;mdash; there are plenty of places with a monopoly on *that* already &amp;mdash; so standard text-only critiques are not allowed! (You could always PM the author on your own time, of course!)

Plus, if your audio critique is well-done and in the style of the critiquecast (unforgivingly honest) we will include it as a guest episode. How about that?

**Who we are: the Critiquecast**

The critiquecast is a side project of Shut Up &amp; Write, a podcast where amateur writers give unfair and unforgiving line-by-line reactions to submitted work. Most of the time, asking for critique from peers results in wimpy, noncommittal feedback. The critiquecast aims to be the opposite extreme: unbridled honesty from the perspective of a prospective reader with no reason to hold back.

You can find the critiquecast on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/shut-up-write-critiquecast/id643508248), subscribe to [our RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/critiquecast), or if you don't have any fancypants ways of listening to podcasts, you can listen to us from our website, [shutupandwrite.net](http://shutupandwrite.net).

I like the advice I see on here and the general spirit, so I was curious if anyone has had any success with doing this and has any specific advice.

I wrote around a 50k novel/novella almost a year ago. I'd actually been sort of writing it for years and years, but last year I got really serious about just chugging through and finishing it, and did, but the end product was just a non-starter.

I'm going back to it now after realizing a way to salvage some of the largest problems with the believably of the plot and the stakes in play for the characters. I did everything I could to write it in a way that didn't seem like overt science fiction, and now realize that I need to embrace that major elements of the story are science fiction, and not to worry about dancing around it.

I'm not so much worried about how to edit this to be a better final product, as I know I'm going to have to get rid of the vast majority of it, but I'm struggling with how much I should attempt to salvage some of the better themes, characters while still writing as if it were an entirely new project. 

Anyone have a good approach to this?

I've long flirted with the idea of writing but until a few months ago I never really dived in. Nowadays, I can't seem to let a day go by without working on one story or another.

I cannot believe such a transformation took place in me in such a short time. It was in a large part due to lurking in this sub and listening to people debunk the common excuses that people make for themselves, or realizing how productive people are on a daily or weekly basis - this has been absolute gold for me.

Thanks for existing as a community. Thanks for getting me to, for the first time in my life, shut up and write.

OK, that was enough of a break - now back to my work-in-progress.

**Edit:** OK, PL_TOC had a great suggestion for me to give a short list of how the SUAW sub has helped me, so thought I'd add this to the post and make it slightly less off topic.

Bear in mind, this is coming from a complete novice. I've always *wanted* to be a writer but I never really pursued it. I wrote the occasional (very) short story growing up, and I read voraciously. About two years ago I was in college for a single semester to wrap up an IT degree, and only had to take the one class, so I took a creative writing course as well.

That course instilled in me a crippling self-doubt that made it impossible to write. After the course was over, I looked at everything I had produced during it and saw nothing but rubbish. I almost gave up on writing entirely.

A year later, I discovered Reddit. A few months into it, I had migrated past the default subs and was getting into /r/writing, then started seeing some SUAW posts mentioned.

**TLDR - start reading now:**

SUAW taught me to expect my first draft to be rubbish. SUAW taught me that there's no single technique or trick or tip that will make me a better writer; its all your-mileage-may-vary and I just have to come up with what works for me. SUAW made me realize that if I was serious about seeing progress, I should try to write *every single day*.

This community would tastefully destroy anyone who tried to offer up the type of excuses that I found myself using; I don't have time (make time or quit calling yourself a writer), I'm not good enough yet (how are you going to get better?), etc.

Probably the most important thing SUAW did for me, though, was to make me realize that I shouldn't be calling it a day at 250 words. I've been able to produce almost ten times that on a good day once I realized what serious writers were producing every day.

1354930851.0,9,self.shutupandwrite,14h6ea,Idea Overdose - How and where the hell do I start?!,9,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/14h6ea/idea_overdose_how_and_where_the_hell_do_i_start/,"I'm going to try and keep this as brief as possible, because even in writing this I have the same goddamn problem - too many ideas!
I'm an amateur  writer and I'm seeking a bit of advice. I don't plan on being published or writing for anyone else; I just write for my own pleasure and to express myself and I share my work without asking for anything in return except maybe some constructive criticism. I'm not looking for any sort of external gratification. I simply seek a creative outlet, and to share it with people not for profit, but simply because it pleases them and myself.

I need advice in organizing my story. I have too many ideas and it is frustrating and overwhelming, I don't know where and how to start. I've been incubating a story in my head for as long as I can remember, and it has a few different written incarnations that I frankly find to be muddled, premature and stupid. I often tell people I wish to write a vast epic tale. Naturally, the first question they ask is ""What's it about."" I feel crazy and foolish when my response is ""I have no idea."" ""Well, how...wait, what?! You don't have a story, then!"" They respond. And to a considerable extent, I agree. I want to change that. 

I know the theme, but know not the plot. The premise has holes, but I know a good deal of the tropes I want to play around with. Character planning is going better than expected, but there's just so much material.

TL;DR - How do I organize the swimming cacophony of ideas in my head into something coherent? How do I find a starting point?

(If you need more specifics on my situation like the ideas I *have* settled on, the theme etc. simply ask and I'll try to elaborate as much as possible in a comment. Your help is much appreciated!)",Organization,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-organization,,True,t3_14h6ea,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/14h6ea/idea_overdose_how_and_where_the_hell_do_i_start/,
1354069600.0,8,self.shutupandwrite,13wso0,"Is there value in writing ""what you know""?",12,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/13wso0/is_there_value_in_writing_what_you_know/,"""Write what you know."" It's a phrase I've heard from fiction and creative writing teachers since I was 15, probably, that I remember. I guess before you're 15, people assume you know nothing. Or at least nothing word writing about (pshaw...if they only knew).

But I also get conflicting reports on what things I ""know"" are appropriate to write about.

My last writing group (whom I adored) were very adamant about not having writer characters. No one wants to read about writers, they insisted. Writers are only interesting to other writers, and even then, they aren't. Even when Stephen King has a writer character, he tortures and abuses them physically and mentally (Jack Torrance of *The Shining*, Paul Sheldon of *Misery*, Mike Noonan of *Bag of Bones*).

Okay, so despite writing being by biggest vocation and passion for the majority of my life, despite it being the one thing I can almost say I ""know,"" I can't write about it.

So what do people mean when they says ""Write what you know""? I don't think we are absolutely limited to only writing about our lives; our gender, race, sexuality, age group, hair color, etc. I think we can write from any perspective we can imagine, so long as the characters are fleshed out enough to act believably. 

Maybe it's about writing from what you ""know"" emotionally. What you've experienced in your life. Those human truths that makes fiction, and non-fiction, universal. I started reading Paul Coelho's *Veronika Decides to Die*, which was translated from Portuguese, I think. It is about a young woman, with a decent job, life, boyfriend, who doesn't want to live any longer. She takes a bunch of pills, expecting it to be enough to kill her, but it was not. She doesn't die, but she wakes up in an institution and is told that the pills caused massive damage to her organs. She is given a week to live.

Now, I haven't finished the book...it's very heavy and emotional...but it is powerful. I believe Veronika is a person. A shallow person, at times, sure, but I know enough shallow people that I can buy that. I can feel her story deep in my psyche, gut, where ever it is a powerful story touches me. 

But, Coelho is not a young woman. I don't think he ever attempted suicide. He actually had a very strong love art and life. So he wasn't using Veronika as a proxy for his life story. However, when he was young, because of his desire to write instead of whatever jobs boring people choose, his parents had him institutionalized. He *knew* what things were like inside a mental institution. He *knew* what it felt like to be thought or to feel crazy. He *knew* what desolation, despair, and abandonment felt like. So, sure, he didn't write about a young man whose parents didn't understand him, but he used the hurt and pain he'd felt as that young man, and built a new story out of it.

I'm trying to move away from always writing about bakers or cooks, simply because writing about things I do every single day is easier than inventing or researching. However, I also try to experience new things when the opportunities arise (hiking, traveling, carnivals, concerts, foods, parties, etc.). And every time I try a new thing, I'm taking notes in the back of my head, always thinking, ""This'll be awesome to use in a story.""

Thinking about it...after 28 years...I wonder just how present I am in most of my experiences. Most of the time I know I'm thinking, ""I really want to go write about this.""",Discussion,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-discussion,,True,t3_13wso0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/13wso0/is_there_value_in_writing_what_you_know/,

I would often come up with concepts and ideas without giving much thought to who or what is doing them. Then when the time came to describe someone or something, I would find myself at a loss, and frustratingly so. I'd start to come up with random features and voices, but it would usually ends up becoming a cartoonish representation of what I really wanted. My creations lacked depth, and the idea would start to fall apart, one step away from a trip to the recycling bin. Then I had an idea.

I started to write down descriptions of interesting people that I would see out and about. I would write down the things that they would say or do, and describe them in as much detail as I could at the time. This was my attempt at capturing the character of a real person, much like an artist might paint someone's portrait. The hard part is organizing the information so that it is readily accessible. Some might see this as cheating --keeping a bank of characters at the ready for use in any story. However, I've found that the description of a person isn't really the meat and potatoes of the story anyway. It's merely for use in the imagination of the reader. There are stories wherein the author barely describes any of the characters at all. In describing characters I have effectively distanced myself from the hardest part of writing for me, and allowing myself to remain objective throughout the writing process.

Here's an example of a character that I took down on a trip away for Labor Day:

&gt;Portly cover band frontman with a potbellied Jack Daniels shirt singing Bruce Springsteen's Dancing in the Dark at a Geneva on the Lake bar. Heart with a knife tattoo on one side and crappy superman tattoo on the other.

This may conjure up mental images for you or it may not, but it definitely gives an outline for me to build on. More importantly, it describes an accurate and semi-detailed situation that I would **almost certainly never think of on my own.** Still, whether I use the characters or not, it still helps complete my ""literary toolbox"" if you will. Coming up with clever and detailed descriptions start to come easier and characters begin to seem more fleshed out and realistic.

I also like to use random street signs that I pass as last names, and sometimes first names. I do this because real people's names are just as unpredictable. Try it! Here are a couple from my town, care of Google Maps:

*Costilla

*Balfour

*Platte 

*Hayman

*Dunsmere

*Farragut

*Cragmor

...really? Nobody? Huh.

For the rest of us, including me, I find that sometimes even when I do have the motivation to write and be productive, I can get distracted way too easily and end up spending precious hours yelling at people about not being productive on a certain web site (ironic, I know).

To combat this, I've implemented something called the [Procrastination Dash](http://www.43folders.com/2005/09/08/kick-procrastinations-ass-run-a-dash) a.k.a. the Pomodoro Technique, but that sounds like something you'd only want to do behind closed doors with someone you love very much.

The concept of it is simple. You break your work into bite-sized chunks and take a small break between those chunks. You do this by having a timer (some will suggest a kitchen timer, I use an app on my iPhone called TaskTimer) that you set for a certain period of time, say, 10 minutes, and focus only on your task during that period of time. After the 10 minutes is up, take a 2 minute break to do whatever. After the 2 minutes, it's back to work. Repeat, repeat, repeat.

It may sound dumb, and it may sound deceptively simple, but for me at least, it works wonders. I did 4 dashes last night at the end of the day and ended up with 1,400 words by the end of it, not feeling stressed about it for a second.

Maybe it taps into some latent undiagnosed ADD I have, but using this technique makes it really, really simple to crank out a lot of words without staring down the dreadful spectre of having to sit in front of Scrivener for 3 straight hours to do it.

In most of the cases where I find I've unwittingly (heh) used them, I can understand that they're (a) lazy writing, (b) unnecessary or (c) from the subtlety of the scene. And so I dutifully remove the crap out of them.

There are one or two I've run into in the editing process, though, that I've been less sure about taking out - their job isn't already done by the implication of the sentence, they aren't added on a knee-jerk (like the accursed 'quickly' usually is), and to create the implication necessary for them to be irrelevant seems like it would take more effort than the verb itself is actually worth in the overall context of the story.

I'm talking here about words like the 'usually' and 'dutifully' I used above. 'Usually' seems like it earns its place in its sentence because it describes the frequency of the action I was referring to, and 'dutifully' seems to communicate a lot of tone which would be difficult to express through description/implication.

Seeing as I am a pleb, I'm most likely wrong. The above was an example of the sort of rationale that leads me to be unsure about removing certain adverbs. 

My question then, to you more skilled in the craft than me, and especially to those vehement critics of the adverb, is whether an adverb can ever be acceptable. If not, why not, and if so what rationale you use to decide for yourself in your writing, and for others when you critique theirs.

A thread next-door inspired me to ask this. Do you use Microsoft Office for writing or OpenOffice and why? Do you write on paper first and then rewrite it digital (part of an editing process)? Do you use something like Sublime?

What about note-keeping or ""character sheets"" (term borrowed from DnD) and such? Do you use evernote? Napkins to write on? Leatherbound scrolls from medieval times blessed by a gypsy? 

Just wondering :)

Here are my tools:

* I use MSOffice for writing (just downloaded MSOffice13, it's sweet)
* sometimes I hop into focuswriter when I feel distracted or want a specific background to inspire me

A word war is motivation though friendly competition, during which two or more people write whatever they want for a certain amount of time (normally 30 minutes per war) and then @sign how many words they've written at the end. Whoever writes the most words ""wins,"" but of course it's not really about that, it's about getting you writing.

Many times I have heard writers say something to the effect of, ""I just put that scene in there to show what a bad guy my bad guy is."" 

Guys, no. Just...no.

There are three levels of antagonism that should be present in a novel for it to reach its highest potential for conflict and suspense:

- Protagonist against self: Aka, ""I am my own worst enemy."" This is where you play on your hopefully well-rounded, dynamic main character to use his own weaknesses against him. We want our heroes to be bigger than life, engagingly heroic, but we also need them to have weaknesses that make them realistic human beings (or cat-people...or androids...whatever). To do this, you have to draw on your character's background and exploit it against him. Is your character spiritual? Test his faith. Is he afraid of fire? Throw a baby in a burning building, and make him choose between facing his fear and saving an innocent. Is he afraid of space (Bones)? Put his ass in space anyway - make him an astronaut against the odds. It is only when characters are forced to come up against their worst attributes, that they are forced to shine a flashlight into the darkness inside themselves, that they can dispel that darkness and become bigger, better people. Think of it in terms of the Mirror Gate in *Neverending Story* - in looking at his fathoms, a generally kind man may discover a streak of cruelty, while a brave man might discover that deep down, he is a coward. It is heroic to see these things, to acknowledge them, and then to overcome them. Courage is not the lack of fear, it is action in the face of fear. 

- Protagonist against environment: This can be society (such as in the novel *1984*) or it can be the literal environment, like nature (Jack London's ""To Build A Fire""). In any case, in order to build the odds against your protagonist, you've got to set the world against him. Murphy's Law all over the damned place. If your hero needs it to work, break it. If he needs a piece of information, make him work for it. Constantly throw wrenches in the plot. This is your rising action. Test your hero's ingenuity and ability to deal with change and disappointment. 

- Protagonist against the other: Here's your big bad. Not all heroes will have a clearly defined antagonist (some will play their own antagonist, and others will simply be against the world) but many of the best stories have a ""bad guy."" There are many keys to creating a realistic (and likeable; yes, likeable!) bad guy. 

Here's a few:

* Vulnerability: Your bad guy *must* have an Achilles heel, the same as your protagonist. Every realistic person has both strengths and weaknesses. If your bad guy has phenomenal cosmic power, guess what? Your hero is probably going to have to result to a deus ex machina to beat him. That is going to piss your readers off. Plus, nobody likes somebody who is perfect. It's annoying. Whether it's your hero or your bad guy.

* Perspective: In his/her own mind, **your antagonist is the hero in his own story.** This is a concept that you must get across to the reader, regardless of whether your bad guy is a greedy Ponzi-scheming banker or an *American Psycho* level crazy. Everybody feels justified in their actions, everybody thinks they have a perfectly good reason for doing what they do. So in order to convey your villain as a real person, you must show a softer side to them. Give them very real reasons for their actions, even if those reasons are ultimately irrational or driven by some kind of mental illness (sociopathy, narcissism, etc...). If you do this, your villain will be better. [Gray morality] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality) is your friend.

* Reason: Do not have your villain act the villain for no fucking reason. See my second point - everyone must act for a very specific purpose, or you're not going to pull it off. Even if your bad guy does something crazy, show that they actually did it because it's the *world* that's crazy, not them! Also, like with your protagonist, it is best if the actions depicted by your villain actually move the plot forward in some way, or give the reader new and interesting information about the world you've created. 

Okay, discussion time:

* What other qualifications do you think foster realism in a bad guy?

* Who is your favorite bad guy in fiction, and why?

* Give us some examples of realistic antagonism in your own writing.

* Do you think a realistic antagonist is as important to a story as a likeable protagonist? Why or why not? Should your readers love your villain as much as your hero?

I know you have all heard this before, but I have some questions and I figured this would be a great place to ask.

I wont say ""I'm working on the next big fantasy series"", though I want to. What I can say is ""I'm working on a fantasy novel."" It's a genre that has always appealed to me and fascinated me, and it is the genre that I write best in. My first question is in regards to original themes and ideas I want to use in my characters. I find it very difficult to imagine a fantasy tale as being something to give an interesting or insightful philosophical, because frankly I've not seen an author do that. 

Do you have any advice on how to take a genre like fantasy and do something completely new with it, without taking away the entire fantasy theme? I want to be true to the source, but I don't want my novel to be ""just another fantasy book,"" I want it to have a message. 

Additionally, I've come across a question that has been bothering me in my work. Oftentimes I see authors who will use references to other authors works or a product in their writing. Authors will say that their character drinks Coca-Cola, or even better, Authors will reference fictional characters from other books. In a story in which a good deal of plot or event is based off of reference, even if it is very obscure, (think a story like Cornelia Funke's Inkheart, or even Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451), to what extent does one have to go out and seek permission of the original author/publisher/owner to use those references? Does this vary depending on reference? Does this change if your tale alters the universe of the other tale?

On one hand, my brain says ""You can't use another persons work, even in reference, without paying the person who originally did it because copyright laws are really intense and you are going to go to jail for plagiarism and you are the lowest author in the world go die."" While my heart says ""Do whatever you want, the fictional universe of your story can be similar to our universe in that they have the same products or other histories or fictions, your tale is fictional and you don't need to pay a royalty to create art.""

Any help would be so wonderful.

Thank you all.

Fuck my shit up if it isn't.

I've finally figured out what my god damn problem is. It's the process.

I want what I write to be perfect as I'm writing it, and that's a stupid way to write. So I finally got myself to ignore that it's terrible and just fucking write. Awesome. I put 2000 words down on paper yesterday and shat out a miserable piece of work. But that's okay, I'll edit this thing later, and it's got the right idea I wanted. This is progress.

That was my goal and I achieved it. I'm happy about that.

*Now* what? Do I go back and fix this horrible thing? Do I just keep writing? I know, I know, anyone can do anything that works for them, but it's taken me two damn years to realize what my first problem was, and I just don't know where to go from here. I don't know what works for me. If I can avoid being *completely* wrong for another two years, that'd be great.

Advice? Where do you go once you have the rough draft of a chapter? The next one? Fix the first one up? Go back and figure out what the chapter needs, or where my characters are lacking?

And I get it, ""just shut up and write"" would be a great way to respond to this post. But just a general direction that is thought to be effective would be great.

This is to answer or at least provide a jumping-off point for some of the common questions beginner writers have, and to prevent the subreddit from getting flooded with the same questions over and over again as we grow larger.

This week's question will be **""Where can I get critiques?""** Share some places (online groups, ways to find groups in person, etc) where you can find people willing to critique your stuff. Feel free to toss out some advice about receiving critique in general. (We'll cover *giving* critique in a future FAQ because that's a *whole* 'nother story.)

###If I may make a suggestion:

For a while now, I've kind of avoided posting anything much other than the weekly check-in and reading threads because I wasn't totally sure what belonged here, and I didn't want to confuse anyone else by posting something I'd regret later.

However, now that we've got the [submission guidelines](/r/shutupandwrite/wiki/submissions) up, which are pretty goddamned lenient as it happens, I'm going to make it a point this week to post **at least one thing** to /r/shutupandwrite outside of the typical weekly threads. If that sounds like something you'd like to add to your goals this week, please do. I'm sure all of y'all have some resource you use that someone else who's subscribed here doesn't even know about, or some essay topic that'd be worth reading and discussing.

let's find out!",7,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1372p9/what_kind_of_writer_am_i_going_to_be_i_dont_know/,"When you come up with an idea for a story, you may love it or you may think its at least good enough to get going on. The next day you may think it is genius in text form or maybe has become a complete wash. Something important I think I'm coming to understand about writing is that you shouldn't put preconceived limitations or goals for yourself. Chicken or the egg - the writer or his genre? Whatever you write gets written and nobody should tell you otherwise, especially not you.

I was writing a story a couple of weeks ago, I wanted it to be a short story, yet still fairly long. Originally, I was madly in love with the idea. The premise was this: a boring man who does all his living in his thoughts gets mugged. The two strangers get to know each other as people, but even after all the talk, our protagonist is forced into stabbing the mugger in self-defense. He breaks down in tears at how very wrong he was in thinking this would have prestige, dignity. Throw in a dash of dialogue and other literary stuff, and bam. One short story ready for the world.

I still like the idea. Unfortunately, a few thousand words in, I stopped for a moment, looked at the incoherent rambling that had been dribbling out the past couple of pages, and deleted the whole mess on the spot. The story just wasn't flowing out like I thought it was supposed to. It sounded brilliant to me when I played it in my head, but in the end, impotent.

Disheartened, I took a break for a few days. Then one day, in our one and only IRC channel, I found myself joining a word war. I had no idea what to write about and certainly did not have anything on my mind in preparation. The war was about to begin and I needed something so I just went with [the daily prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/thedailyprompt/comments/130ef2/the_daily_prompt_for_11_november_2012_when/), saying to myself, ""today will be a nice little excercise.""

At first glance, the prompt seemed a bit played out and not really my style, but options were few and time was short. After half an hour, I had written just over 500 words. Seeing as how I'm quite the novice to this more serious approach to writing, I was pleasantly suprised. all things considered. More than just the word count though, something else was special about this. Writing it was fun. If you ever find yourself having fun writing, even if you may think this fun is producing unintelligble garbage no one will ever read, it is still worth it. Worth it for more than just the ""happy after-school special"" reason of ""as long as you're having fun, that's what really counts!"" No, if you are writing and having fun, you are practicing writing the types of things you may end up writing about for quite a long time.

I don't know what type of writer I am, I don't know what type of writer I'm going to be, and I honestly am not sure if I even have the right to call myself a writer. Perhaps for now, I'll settle with being just some guy writing about a cybernetic being who has been reconsctructed in the future and finds himself at the whims of an anti-cybernetics terrorist sect. That suits me just fine for now.

I've been fixing dumb bugs since I announced it in the channel earlier this week. This is what happens when you put a hobbyist coder in charge of something.

Anyway! If you're interested come check it out [in IRC](/r/shutupandwrite/wiki/irc). Here's a list of the commands.

`!status` tells you if there is a wordsprint currently going on in the channel and, if there is, how much longer it is going for and who's in it.

`!sprint` starts a wordsprint. By default, a wordsprint is 30 minutes long and starts 5 minutes after you run the command. You can set a different length by following the command with a number, for example `!sprint 15` for a 15-minute sprint, or `!sprint 15 2` for a 15-minute sprint starting in 2 minutes.

`!join` joins a wordsprint already in progress.

`!leave` leaves a wordsprint.

`!close` ends a wordsprint early, for example if you've accidentally created a sprint that was too long or too short. The only person (besides admins) who can close a wordsprint is the person who started the wordsprint, to prevent abuse.

`!wordcount NNN` or `!wc NNN` (where `NNN` is a number) tells the bot your current wordcount. If you run this command before the sprint starts, it will set your starting wordcount, and the bot will automatically calculate the difference between your new wordcount and starting wordcount when you report it later on. If you run the command while the sprint is going on, it assumes your starting wordcount is 0 and sets your count accordingly. If you've joined late and are not starting from 0, use `!wc reset NNN` to set your starting wordcount anytime.

`!wc add NNN` where `NNN` is a number of words adds that number of words to your wordcount. If the sprint has not started yet, this command adds `NNN` words to your starting wordcount.

`!wc reset NNN` where `NNN` is a number of words sets your wordcount to 0 and sets your starting wordcount to `NNN`.

`!final` tells the bot you're finished and not to wait up for you to update your wordcount one last time at the end of the sprint.

It’s easy to set a scene that a reader is familiar with. But a new world, or galaxy, filled with strange sentient life? That’s an awful lot of information to throw at a reader. It was an awful lot of information for you as the writer to come up with, too. It’s a big accomplishment, without doubt. But all that effort means nothing if there’s no story to tell within it.

But what constitutes a setting? Most people answer with ‘the time and place a story takes place in’. So one answer could be Victorian Paris. Another could be in an arm of a distant galaxy. But the place isn’t the only thing that creates the setting. The general populace creates it too, and their cultures. Languages. All those things that go into your worldbuilding, before you even decide who the protagonist is. 

Which is the problem, right there. To write about the struggle between two cultures isn’t a story. Broad stroke generalizations about the deep-set hatred between dwarves and elves is setting, even if you have one dwarven and one elven character that are forced to team up. It shouldn’t be a situation where you throw two characters together and they espouse for page after page about why their point of view is correct. Or go into the nuances of the conflict every time they open their mouths. 

What is your central conflict?

Ask yourself that every time you start a scene. The central conflict IS the hatred between the insectoid Klicklaks and the hated avian Flutters? Then how does that play out? If your piece sounds like a history lesson given by Ben Stein, then you’re providing the reader with setting again. Conflicts are personal. Each character has one, and each character has at least one person that embodies those things they hate. Characters need to act (have agency), and for that action to mean something, it must be opposed (Newton’s laws are even applicable to writing! Who knew!). Who is the opposing force? Ideas are not opposing forces! Ideas create the opposing forces, getting into the minds and guiding the actions of the antagonists. Your character may hate the concept of wanton abuse of natural resources, but without someone to struggle against, what makes him any different than a blogger sitting on a recliner sipping tea while they type out a scathing rebuke on their iPad? And that rebuke is nothing more than setting- creating the environment in which the conflict exists (Here is the situation, and here is the counter argument against it). It’s this small difference that causes confusion, and ends up creating genre writing that is nothing more than elaborate setting. 

Be aware of your characters, of their individual conflicts, and what constitutes conflict for them. If it’s an action they perform, it’s story. If it’s the reason behind the situation that prompts the action, it’s setting. Keep your work focused on story. While actions require setting to have meaning, setting itself is not the story.

A wordwar is a bit of friendly competition to encourage you to get writing done. Two or more people write whatever they want for a certain amount of time (usually 30 minutes per war) and report how many words they've written at the end. Whoever writes the most words ""wins,"" but of course it's not really about that, it's about getting you writing.

In the weekly check in threads I've been talking about (and promptly failing to do) some character creation. To tell the truth, the characters are created. I know what they look like, I know what they do. They are already dolls that have actions across a board. With most of my writing, however, I fall into a trap where something seems off. Something is not quite human about them. 

This is when I typically turn to character surveys, do some ""fleshing out"" as I've heard it called. As mentioned in [this week's check-in](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/18b61g/weekly_checkin_february_11th/c8daexx) most of those surveys are filled with superficial detail questions. What's their favorite color? When is their birthday? What is their hair style? Well I have all that. 

What I'm asking here is a maybe your favorite or most useful resource/survey used for character ~~creation~~ exploration. I linked [this one](http://robdyoung.com/fleshy-character-questionnaire/) but I don't answer most of those questions. At one point I went to [this one](http://www.eclectics.com/articles/character.html) as well, but it was slow moving and the questions are pretty vague. 

Also suggested, if we don't come up with some good links here, we could make our own damn character exploration survey and what-if questions.

Midway through, strange noises come from upstairs. Shrieks. Groans. Unearthly cries. Two of the boys decide, incredibly, they will investigate. *Only in the sims*, Digger thinks. But he wants them to stay together. The boy in the lead is tall, good-looking, with a kind of wistful innocence.

In this scene, the characters are watching a *sim*, which is like a movie. The first line is, like the rest of the novel, written in past tense. But then there's a line break, a new paragraph, and its present tense until the end of the scene.

I didn't see anything but if I missed a thread about this, sorry!

For the past year or so, I've gotten back into writing stories that I normally tell my friends. I know that sort of writing is tricky and not everyone is going to dig it, but I'm tired of caring about that so much and would rather create a starting point. 

The bare basics of the book are stories that I tell. True stories. Most have happened to me, some have not happened to me but I tell them anyway. Most are funny, some are uncanny, others are enlightening and a few are terrifying. I did stand-up for a while and decided that I wanted to take the time and write all of this into one book. 

There are of course, reoccurring characters (my friends, mainly) and some stories wrap into others later in life. I guess I could call it character development? I don't know, I start to piece everything together but then I feel loss and give up. 

Is there a starting point for something like this? Do I just begin wherever the hell I want? Have any of you done something like this? How did you do it?

Stuff like this:

* Random cluster headaches
* Electrocution
* A fight ending with one character's arm nearly severed and her eye slowly gouged out with a finger
* Toxin that destroys nerve connections
* Starvation
* Acid burns and deaths
* Live, forced organ ""donors""
* burned alive in a cockpit
* Self mutilation
* Severe and crippling nausea
* Massacre by wrecking a train
* Slaughter by military sqauds
* drug induced insanity and cannabilism (aka zombies where the people can recover from zombiness and must realize what they just did)
* Impaled on an art sculpture
* Extraction of medical implants
* Getting shot
* Limb torn off by projectile
* Beaten to near death in a sparring match
* Suicide
* Blade wounds
* Self-applied tourniquet
* Deafening by explosion

And yet.... I really don't think it's all that bad. It's dark, certainly, but there are plenty of uplifting moments as well as the cruel ones. Does the magnitude of the suffering necessitate equivalent happiness?

I guess I'm really asking: If were reading a book that had these kinds of horrors, do you suspect something is terribly wrong with the author?

Note that the story falls in the cyberpunk/sci-fi category, so several of these are not as lethal or permanent as they seem.

As I dive into my revised outline before I assault the mountain that is the second draft I thought I’d write about my thoughts on a subject that gets debated a lot online, plotting v pantsing.

These can be viewed as two extremes of a spectrum. Plotting is all about having a firm outline before you start writing and mostly sticking to it as you know where it is going. Pantsing is all about having an idea and discovering the plot as you go, writing by the seat of your pants.

Very few writers will sit firmly in one camp or another, most will exist somewhere in between. I sit on the plotting side, I write outlines and try to stick to them for the first draft. However I will make big changes for the second draft, and I’m flexible about making more changes as I go along so I have elements of the pantsing side in my approach.

If you are writing a series (and my books are now looking to be a series of four rather than a trilogy) I feel some outlining will always be necessary to plot out the overall story-arcs and make sure it is all consistent.

For me this discussion about how you approach writing a book will always come down to what works best for each individual writer. Whatever works best for you is what matters. More important to me is something that can be applied to both approaches.

**Have an ending in mind**

This to me is crucial whether you outline or use the discovery method, you need to have an idea of where you are going with it. It’s no use just writing whatever comes to mind if you are just rambling around desperately trying to work out where you are going, if you have a vague idea what your ending will be it is something you can push towards, you know your book needs to end up there.

It doesn’t matter if it all changes in the next draft, or it goes odd twists and turns on the way, moving your story towards that ending will save you a lot of time around the middle trying to see where it is all going. The ending may change completely once you get there, just have a vague flag off in the distance you can work towards.

A wordwar is a bit of friendly competition to encourage you to get writing done. Two or more people write whatever they want for a certain amount of time (usually 30 minutes per war) and report how many words they've written at the end. Whoever writes the most words ""wins,"" but of course it's not really about that, it's about getting you writing.

I have a passage from Ecce Homo (Friedrich Nietzsche) for you.


""Has anyone at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration?  If not, I will describe it.  If you had the slightest residue of superstition left in you it would hardly be possible to completely disregard the idea that one is the mere incarnation, a mouthpiece or a medium of an almighty power.  The idea of revelation in the sense of something which profoundly moves and provokes, becoming suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy—is a simple description.  You hear—you do not seek; you take—and do not ask who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes as a necessity, without hesitation—I have never had any choice in the matter.  There is an ecstasy so great that the immense strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears during which one does not know whether one is coming or going.  There is the feeling of completely being outside of oneself, with the very distinct consciousness of endless delicate shivers right down to one’s toes;—there is a depth of happiness in which the most painful and gloomy parts do not detract from the whole but are produced and required as necessary shades of colour amidst such an overflow of light.  There is an instinct for rhythmical relationships which embrace a whole world of forms: length, the need of an all-embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of the force of inspiration, a kind of compensation for its pressure and tension.  Everything happens quite involuntarily as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom of absolute power and divinity.  The involuntary nature of the images and similes is the most remarkable thing; one loses all perception of what is imagery and metaphor; everything seems to present itself in the readiest, the truest and simplest means of expression.  It actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra’s own phrases, as if all things came together and offered themselves as images.  (""Here do all things come caressingly to your discourse and flatter you for they would wish to ride upon your back.  On every simile you rid here unto every truth.  Here fly open to you all the speech and word shrines of the world, here would all existence become speech, here would all Becoming learn of you how to speak”.)  This is my experience of inspiration.  I do not doubt but that I should have to go back thousands of years before I could find another who could say to me: ""It is mine also”!
