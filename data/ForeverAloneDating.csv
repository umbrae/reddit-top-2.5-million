I'm a generally happy person, I enjoy doing many different things (I'm a huge Pokemon and Star Wars fan, I'm an artist, dog trainer, sandwich maker, remote control- you name it (I couldn't help adding that last part, I don't mean to offend anyone by it)). I don't complain, and it's quite hard to annoy me. I have a very weird/stupid/dark sense of humor, and I adore making people laugh. I love talking about life, philosophy, psychology, animals, tattooing, books and travelling. My all-time favorite band is The Beatles. I don't watch TV, but I do watch episodes of my favorite shows...which are mostly cartoons...





Here comes the shitty part (you don't have to read this part...):



Although I it's entirely my fault that I have no friends, I don't regret getting rid of them. They were only fair weather friends anyway. I live in a country where it's hard to find people who are ""like me"". I mean, well, my last break-up gave me a nervous break-down. Those people whom I once called friends; the ones who I took care of when they were ill, the ones I gave a home to, because they lost their jobs because of whatever reason, none of them had the time to give me a pat on the back or a shoulder to cry on when I was blamed for cheating on my ex when I haven't done anything. I know it's my fault for expecting too much, but c'mon; there has to be a real human somewhere, right??


I just want someone human, to be my friend or more. I really need something that's real. I'm so tired of getting cheated. I want a partner who is genuine.

really is something special. I'm a 21yo guy who met this girl on reddit(r/foreveralonedating) on may 9th
and we started talking, and we talked a lot. I live in new york city
and she in Washington state, were about 3000 miles apart. We were
skyping for about 5 to 7 hours a day for almost every single day for two months. Shes
so perfect and beautiful, I began to get feelings for her stronger
than just being her best friend. I can talk about absolutely anything
with her, together we work through everything so easily and our ability
to talk and communicate is by far our best quality and what 
makes us strongest. So after I started getting feelings for her, of course
it was really scary, I didnt want to ruin what we had, she was 
already my best friend. So I tried to kinda ignore them and hope
that theyd go away but I soon realized that I was being silly.
I could have tried and convinced myself for weeks that she wasn't so perfect
for me and that she wasnt the sweetest girl Id ever met, but that would
just be me being in denial because she was all I thought of her and more.
Im 21 and shes almost 19, and neither of us have ever been a relationship
before we met, we both look at relationships as being something very
serious and only plan on being in one. We feel that a relationship
that starts should already at that point have certain 'vows' that
come with it, instead of just experimenting with people and their
emotions. I always thought that when the right girl for me would come 
along, it'll be clear that she is the only one Id be with. And with my 
princess nothing has ever been more clear than our destined long
future together. 

A little less than two months after we first started
talking, I felt the time was right and I told her how I felt, the 
biggest risk I ever took in my life. She was surprised and just 
confused at first, the night ended with us agreeing to talk about it
another time, she said she needed time to think. This was a friday 
and she was going away for the weekend, so that was the worst possible
time for us to not be able to talk for a couple days. She did a lot
of thinking during her weekend away, and when we finally talked
again on Monday (it felt like a month away on Friday night), she
said she also has feelings for me beyond that best friends have,
and was willing to give a long distance relationship a try. 

This was July 9th, and a couple days ago was our one month anniversary, and I 
could honestly say I love this girl more and more each day. She means
the world to me and everything with her is just so effortless. We knew
from the beginning that a long distance relationship would be hard, but 
we were convinced that theres nothing we wouldnt be able to work through. 
And we were right, its soo much harder than we ever could have thought, theres
nothing I dream of more than just being with her one night, but I know our time
will come and the wait would make it the best day ever, and we'll experience happiness
that day that most people would probably never come close to feeling. Theres 
no better feeling in the world than feeling loved for exactly who you
are, and we both have that feeling. We don't have to try and impress each other,
or try and do more than we were comfortable with, we really are just ourselves
with each other all the time. We dont have to worry about us being upset with 
each other or even us not being together at any point, because we already
promised to work through all the issues that will ever come up, and thats 
exactly what we've done so far. I know this might sound silly, but the same way
my sister will always be my sister no matter what our future holds, I know this girl
is as just permanent of a girlfriend to me. We even picked out our kids name one day
already. We already told pretty much all our family about each other, and I even
started talking to and getting to know her friends and sister.

The reason we wanted to share this with you guys is so you realize that love
is out there to find, never give up on it. I wish everyone can feel what we 
feel for each other because its truly amazing. Just keep at it, and don't ever
do yourself short. Theres someone out there that will make each of you feel
so happy and loved all the time, and anyone less than that isn't worth your time. 
I never would have thought that I would find a girl for me in the next five years at least,
but I'm blessed to have found her, so thank you reddit for changing my life forever,
and I cant wait to hear about all of you finding love so pure that it comes with 
zero doubts or second thoughts. Thanks for reading :)

As the title says, I'm a 22 year old college girl here in Houston. I spend most of my time playing games, thinking about games, and learning how to make them. I'm just hoping to find someone who has the same amount passion for gaming that I do. Someone to stay up with until 4 am raiding on WoW, playing counterstrike, or maybe just some guitar hero. I do like to go out and party, but mostly I would just rather stay in and play games with someone I care about whether it be a computer RTS, console FPS, or a board game like munchkin or settlers of catan (although those probably wouldnt be as fun with just two people lol).

I'm not fat or anything. I'm 5'4"", skinny, and very attractive. If I wanted to, I know I could easily go to any bar and find any good-looking douche to take home, but that's not me. The main problem I have in the dating world is that I'm a male-to-female transsexual. I pass 100% of the time and so I'm very nervous about going around dating guys and having to tell them this, knowing that if they wanted to, they could out me to other people. And at this point in my transition(I'm on hormones, been living as a woman for well over a year, and I've had my name and gender legally changed), having other people find out about my past is the very last thing I want.

So if you're looking for a girl who loves anything and everything that has to do with gaming, and you don't have a problem about my past, hit me up!

I am 24 and living in Japan teaching English. It's a pretty awesome job and we get paid more than most of us should. Forced myself to come here so that I'd get out and meet more people, but it turns out its just as easy to be a shut-in in another country.

I am bad at being concise...

Rules say that I should say what is awesome about me?
Not... really... sure....

I am drama free and I don't think I've ever gotten in a fight with ANYONE (not counting family). Not sure thats a good thing.. but I feel as if I am logical most of the time and wouldn't freak out over stupid things. 

I'd like to think I am average in intelligence and not too bad looking. 5ft7 and 135lbs.. normalish..
I am a bit lazy, but luckily not pudgy yet. Its a little intimidating to look at dating sites where EVERY SINGLE GUY says he works out everyday...  
I don't play video games (well ok I do enjoy Yoshi's island on DS), but most of my friends do and I think its a worthwhile hobby ^_^ I spend most of my time internet surfing, trying to cook and failing at it and writing fantasy novels that are probably not very good and occasionally working. I have a lot of free time, but I don't like going out by myself so usually I sit at home while I should be out enjoying this awesome country.

I have kickass pet husky rats that do kickass rat things and are part ninja and I love them!  I will someday prove to my parents that someday a man will love me despite my choice in pets (they debate this...) I also love all other animals and have owned just about every type... 

I figure if the dating thing doesn't work out I'll just become a crazy rat lady and someday be found eaten to death by a hoard of rodents.


[](/party ""hover text"")  

You have to admit being eaten by the thing you love would be a cool way to go out.


I am OCD neat and tidy! I clean ALL of the things!

An ideal evening would be cuddling on a couch while watching an awesome zombie movie or something b-rated and amazingly bad while eating pizza ..or maybe pancakes... or both. I'd like to find someone who is a friend that wants to live a simple life together ...

Firstly, just to say that I've messaged the mods for permission about submitting this and they've said it's fine so long as I'm not trying to sell you anything - which I'm not!

I've been thinking for quite a while now about starting a dating website that only allows users to list their flaws, along with a photograph if they choose. It sounds crazy, but I actually think it has many advantages, such as:

* it creates a less superficial dating environment
* it means users can feel more confident that they aren't being tricked into thinking someone has certain attributes when they might not

I mean there has to be at least a glimmer of physical attraction, otherwise the personality matching up is not going to matter. I'm not a douche. I LOVE getting to know a girl more than anything!

Hey there! I'm 19, a college student, and thought I'd give this a shot. Long story short, I've been single for about a year now, and I miss the closeness and support of a relationship. I tried the hook-up thing recently and just didn't find it fulfilling, so it's back to the dating scene! :)

I'm a pretty open, mellow person. I like being with people and having fun; going to the beach is probably my favorite thing to do, since I live on the coast of Lake Michigan.  My other big pass-time is being a nerd. I love Star Trek more than anything, and next to that comes Marvel, DC, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and a longer list of less-favorites that I won't rattle off.  I'm not a big gamer, but I am really into Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros.  I get viciously competitive about Nintendo games.

I've never tried meeting anyone online before, but what the hell? No one should be truly forever alone.

About me:

*I am fat! Not ""curvy"" or ""thick"" or a thin girl fishing for compliments. Actually fat! If you're ok with that, stick around. =) If not, that's okay too.

*I am a tomboy when it comes to my interests. I love action and martial arts movies, post-apocalyptic fiction and first-person shooters (even though I'm not very good at them)

* I also love ""bad"" movies a la The Room, The Wickerman, etc.

*I love learning about language and culture. I also think math, astrophysics and computer science are very interesting when they're explained to me in layman's terms.

*I love animals, especially dogs. Cats are nice too. I love watching nature specials.

*My ideal Friday night would be seeing a great action movie or playing beer pong with my friends. I am nervous around new people but once I am used to them I love having them around.

*I'd love to get more into the outdoors/sports. I'm currently working on my weight and fitness goals.

I turned 20 within the last few weeks and I've decided to reach out online. I go to school full time, work a pretty weird (but great) job. I really dislike where I live right now, and I don't really get along with very many people in my area. I'm planning on moving when I'm through with graduate school, so all of that adds up to location and IRL type things being a non-issue. I like to be goofy and light hearted most of the time, but it generally makes people think that's all I am, but I also have a serious and somber side. I'd like to be able to find someone who I can feel comfortable acting either way. My friends think I'm a little boring because I don't like going out to clubs or parties, and I can't say I disagree. I'm a very empathetic and emotional person. 

My interests are writing, English as a language in general, science fiction/fantasy, and the human experience/humans as a whole. (Does that make me sound pretentious? I swear I'm not!) Music is a big part of my life, and I really like too many bands to get into in a small space. I love movies and television too (okay, who doesn't?). I really like having in depth conversations and generally over-analyzing things I like, so if you have a crazy theory about the next Star Trek movie, or a truckload of opinions about the Christmas special of Doctor Who, don't hesitate. 

My favorite thing about relationships (platonic and otherwise) is getting really close with someone else: knowing all of their stories and their quirks, their loves, hates, fears, and just generally feeling that emotional closeness.

And let me give you an AMAZING piece of advice, ForeverAloneMen.

**You are NOT doing yourself favors by waiting to show her your photo.**

It's become clear to me, particularly from the PMs, that you guys think you are giving yourselves the upper hand. You ask girls if they want photos to gauge interest. You talk first. You tell them about yourselves. You try to woo them with your personality.

Here's the thing: you think you will impress her enough that you will seem more attractive based on what she already knows about you. THIS IS NOT TRUE.

When women start talking to a guy, and they don't know what he looks like, do you know what they do? They imagine what he *might* look like. And boys, a girl is NEVER going to imagine someone hideous. We all HOPE you'll be attractive.

So when you finally do show her your picture, there are two options: either you're attractive, and she's thrilled, or you're unattractive, and she's disappointed.

THE OUTCOME WOULD BE THE SAME IF YOU'D POSTED THEM INITIALLY. With one tiny, important difference: if you're unattractive, you become LESS attractive than you would have been if she'd seen the photo right away, because she is now comparing you to the guy she thought you'd be.

You have NOTHING to lose by posting your photo right away. NOTHING. The girls who pass you up would NOT have dated you if you'd waited to show your picture. A girl is not going to fall for your words, see your photo, struggle through her lack of attraction, and then happily date you. That shit only happens in the movies with already reasonably attractive people.

Post your photo, because the number of girls who will pass you up is surpassed by the number of girls who won't consider you AT ALL because you don't have a photo.

I'm single. I'm not physically attractive for one, let me get that out of the way. I promise I'm not. And I'm not like geeky girl stereotype that can go from a 3 to an 8 by taking off her glasses. I'm unattractive, and I live in a rural community. There's only a few single guys here, and I'm not interested in them at all.

I really have no friends. I'm socially awkward and basically relied on a couple friends all my life. I went through a rough patch where I isolated myself from a lot of people. My friends saw that as a slight, and stopped talking to me. Things haven't been the same since. I don't have anyone to go out with, see a movie, eat with, etc.

I only have one family member who talks to me. Other than that, I'm a 23 year old who lives alone in a house I inherited. I won't go into the more sad things...it's totally not appropriate for this. But being alone constantly...living alone...and having no one check on you for days and days. It sucks sometimes.

But aside from being an unattractive female with baggage, I also have a lot of interesting qualities!

I'm in school, studying computers. I'm not sure how that's going to go. I also work a crappy retail job that I'm about to quit. This isn't interesting.

I do have some enjoyment in life. I love music (all kinds) and movies. I totally have Netflix. I love PC games and play a few.

I love animals. I have two dogs who help being forever (human) alone a little easier to deal with. They're great friends.

I am a really nice person, to a fault. I don't have it in me to be mean or even rude to people who act like that to me.

I'm really sensitive. I'm good at empathy, and it comes easily to me. 

I love thinking about the big things in life. Our creation, our purpose. Politics, religion, philosophy. Despite all the thinking and studying, I still accept I know next to nothing. So my opinions tend to change. 

I really like most people. I'm shy IRL, but online it's different. I feel as though I can really speak openly. So if you want to talk, feel free to message me. I don't care about any superficial thing like age, looks, or location. Or gender. Or viability. I would talk to a hamburger if it talked back.

And, I'm not one of those people pretending to be FA and posting in this section because it makes it easier for me to stand out. Not saying people do that at all, I have no clue. Just saying I don't, and I know what it's like. Depressed, anxious, unsure of how to leave the house...been there.

Only opening one car door, cooking just one meal, or looking at the amount of space wasted by your couch on a Movie night just rips a force inside of that leaves you devoid of hope, your dreams squashed, and generally away from everything.

Hours alone turn into days.  Days turn into weeks.  Weeks turn into months.  Months pass into seasons, and then years start going by one by one.  At this point in time, I'm a year number six.  I could describe the emptiness of knowing that the only reason that you made a Christmas meal was so that the knives were dirty (so you wouldn't harm yourself).  Describe the hurt of forgetting about Valentine's day when you go out to dinner and the hostess looks at you with a confused look when you tell her that you want a table for one.  Being called the ""weird loner guy"" from the neighborhood moms when you're out and about.

You get the occasional pity date, but you turn to food and sugar to mask the pain.  Repressed memories turn to vivid reality...remembering what it was like to hold that person in your arms at night when she was there -- knowing that she'll never lay there again, even if for no fault or no action of your own.  The lunches that she'd bring you, the dinners that she'd make with a smile, and the way that she'd roll over on you in the middle of the night when she wasn't feeling well or having a bad dream make you wish that you had someone close to call your own.

Eventually, you start getting into hobbies.  I've spent 80 hours in a hot glass shop in a week building a mirror so that it would refract light with a better accuracy than most telescopes for no other reason than I haven't had anything else to do.  I've rebuilt a gasoline, and then a diesel engine.  I've learned how to do plumbing, HVAC, and some framing.  I've trained as an EMT, served as a fire watcher in a national forest, and volunteered to work on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Want to get into an in-depth technical conversation about lockpicking or computer forensics?  Yup -- I can do that.  Want to talk about the subtleties of the last few concerts that the Cincinnati Symphony has put in?  Yeah, I can do that too.  I can talk about Monet's springtime and the impressionistic and ideal views that the painting represents.  I can talk about my education (MBA, JD), my past careers, or, anything else, but, I tend to stay away from my past girlfriends -- mainly because the pain is just too much to bear.

I'm 33.  I work out five days a week.  I work two jobs, volunteer at three or four non profits, and have many 'friends' who generally use my money (but spend time with me).  I want to find someone who is going to love me the same way that I love them -- with the intensity and compassion that people will look at us when we are at our worst and think that we are at our best.

well, I'm 24, single, never had a boyfriend and I'm just looking for people to talk to and maybe meetup if you're close to me. :)

What I do in my freetime (except for writing job-applications) is playing games, but mostly older adventure games and point-and-clicks like Monkey Island and Sam'n'Max.

Like 'holy god this is going to give me a heart attack' kind of cheesy.
I'm going to hit you with a ton of text, by the way, so HEY WATCH OUT FOR THAT WALL OF TEXT

 Like most of you, I'm relatively normal, except, I suppose, I'm not.  
 I like all the usual rubbish that people do, like breathing and eating and thinking I'm really more interesting than I actually am.

 I'm a certified scribbler; I spend a lot of time with a little reporter's notepad, scribbling down ideas, and thoughts, and doodles.  
 These range from story ideas, to snippets of poems, to 'must buy milk. Must also buy stuff to use milk with'.

  I'm a huge fan of going nuts to music, and when I'm sat at my desk, with some music playing,
 I like to have a little boogie, and headbang, and sing along even if I don't know the words.
 Especially if I don't know the words. I like to sing as loud as I can, and if it gets me disapproving looks, I just pretend they're jealous of my proper good skills and ting.

  I'm a huge explorer. I've done everything from 'exploring', as in turning down one street instead of another, to 'urban exploring',   
where you go to abandoned and derelict places, to 'adventure exploring',  
 where you basically get some money, some essentials, and a ticket to somewhere, and go find what you can find.

  I adore cooking, too- it seems awfully stereotypical of me, but there's nothing I like more than being in a kitchen. I love to create recipes, or adapt recipes, and if I get the opportunity to cook something awesome and amazing, then I'll do it, seriously. I can- and will- cook anything from snacks to starters to full on several-course-meals.


 I really like older music- so anything from as far back as the 20s, all the way to the 90s, because modern stuff is rubbish, for the most part. 
 I especially love big band music, and swing, and jazz- the kind of things that Sinatra, Armstrong, et al, would play.

  I'm a definite bibliophile, too- I have about 500 books of various ages and genres, from signed books to first editions, from old leather-bound tomes, to books so new I haven't even read them yet. 
  I love thrillers, especially 'crime' stories, and the old detective novels where all the men said things like 'the dame had gams that reached all the way to the ground and back again'. I like horrors, too, so long as they're not gory.

  Speaking of not-gory horrors, I like my films psychological too, from horrors that make you wonder if anything happened, to 
  thrillers that make you go 'OHMYGOD' when you find out just who the killer actually was.
   I also love musicals.

  I love to play games and I'm frequently found on my Xbox when I'm not doing other things.
   I'm addicted to RPGs, and I love any game where there's even a modicum of customisation, so that's led me to buy some really, really dodgy games in the past.
   I have tons of games, and a few consoles, so I'm happy to chat about it any time you like!

  I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for, or what I'm hoping for; just some conversation would be pretty cool, but anything else is a bonus.
   I'm not too fussy about age, or location, but I would prefer it if you were legal, so I don't feel like i'm babysitting, you know?

  Anyway, drop me a PM if you're interested, or ask questions here, and I'll try and get back to you!

In no uncertain terms:

3) I am currently obsessed with The Hobbit. It's probably at an unhealthy point. You have no idea.

TLDR: girl wants boyfriend, difficulty dating because of self esteem / independence issues.

Throwaway account :) I'm a young 20-something female looking for a relationship. I graduated university, have tons of hobbies, and I'm attractive and hilarious. I make friends easily and have quite a fulfilled life despite my lack of security.

I'm on a weight loss journey and need to lose more weight to feel comfortable naked in my skin. This is important for me to release self-conscious feelings. I'm working on it and other areas of my life that need improvement (my financial situation for example, I'm in a transitional stage that feels somewhat stagnant) but because of this insecure stage, I have anxiety toward dating. Even if I'm receiving positive signals, I feel I create complexity by being honest about where I am right now in my life (nervous/lost, poor-ish, and finding my way!)

Do you feel it's worth it to date during these types of transitional periods? I've done it occasionally but regardless of the guy, it all comes back to the same problem: I'm not happy with me. This is why I'm trying to just continue working on myself throughout this process.

If it's worth sharing, I have minimal experience (I've gone on 4 dates recently, with a few minimal bar/party related hook-ups/conversations throughout my life) and I had one monogamous-but-unofficial relationship for over a year with someone I was close to for about 7 years. I get hit on a lot but I don't want internet relationships or casual dating (without the intention of making it a thing if it's working). What does everyone think? Should I drop the dating and focus on myself? Should I do a little bit of both?

I don't drive; if we find ourselves hitting it off nicely and enjoying the company of each other, perhaps you could take me out to a movie or something similar?

Here are some of my interests/likes:  
* Video games.  
* Anime (not overly so.)  
* Writing (I *love* to write poetry.)  
* Taking in an indie flick or two.  
* Reading psychology textbooks.  
* Dogs.  
* Analyzing/observing the human condition.

* Excessive amounts of affection.  
* Unwarranted clinginess.  
* The touching of my person without good reason.  
* Urban slang.  
* House cats.  
* People with no respect for themselves and are able to easily lose their sense of self.

Probably too much... But none the less, I figured I'd put my thoughts into words and wrangle them into something legible because THAT'S WHAT I DO YEAH! Or something....

In a nut shell (and a possible tl;dr), dating is a primarily one sided affair, in which men are expected to be active, and women are expected to be passive.

Now what do I mean by that? From my experiences and observations (and that's all these are) men are socially encouraged all their lives to ""seek out"" find and ""ask out"" the right girl. Their friends will tell them to go ask her out. Their parents will wonder when they'll ask a nice girl out. Their co-workers will ask why they DIDN'T ask out the girl they thought was cute. Because everybody expects men to be proactive in this regard.

HOWEVER!

Girls are socially indoctrinated from a young age to ""wait for the right guy to come along"", ""be rescued by their prince charming"" and ""get asked to the dance"" etc. Friends don't offer encouragement to ask out the guy she likes. They offer tips on ""How to get him to notice her"". They're inclined to set her up with ways to get him to ask her out.

Our entire dating social structure seems to be needlessly bogged down in early 50's middle America!

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that I think the reverse should be true ""So you understand men's pain!"" or some equally chauvinistic bull. I'm saying that this is a situation that hurts everybody involved. Nobody wins like this. The men feel pressured like they have to instigate things every time. And the women feel pressured like they have to sit back and wait. Why must we think and act like this?

If you like somebody. Just tell them. If somebody likes you and is brave enough to say it, don't let yourself be weirded out etc. Take the compliment for what it is. Take a step back and consider actually talking to them before deciding how to react.

This isn't an issue exclusive to the real world either. You can see it on most dating sites if you start to delve into their communities, and you can see it very clearly on this subreddit. [M4F] threads either pass in silence, or have a single response tree (usually 2 - 5 comments long), and [F4M] threads are almost never empty, and will have 4 - 5 response tree's, often with 5 or 6 extra unanswered comments below it all.

I'm sure to get a lot of responses saying ""There's more guys than girls"" or something to that effect. But I can't help but wonder if this social stigma isn't somehow related. The girls put themselves out there, and the guys approach them. It's just too similar...

So I guess that's my views, experiences and findings. Maybe somebody will find them interesting? I like to hope so.",,False,,t5_2sdpe,False,,,True,t3_oiqis,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/oiqis/the_stigma_of_dating/,

Let me tell you a little about myself. As the title implies I'm a 21 year old male. I live in northern missouri, about an hour away from the Iowa border. I enjoy pretty much all things geeky. Like video games, comics books, fantasy movies. But not quantum physics, that stuff's hard. I really enjoy making people laugh, even if I'm not great at it, haha. I'm pretty much up for anything as long as it doesn't involve massive amounts of narcotics, or a goat. 

I would include a picture, but I look terrible after crawling out of bed. So I'll have one up soon, potential ladyfriends!

So, if I've still got your attention at this point you should send me a pm or leave a comment. I'm sure I'll respond fairly quickly! Thanks for your time!
 
EDIT: I have more intel! I also enjoy Dr. Who, but who doesn't? And long walks on the beach, (I've never been to a beach, but I'm sure I'd enjoy it.) I also play Magic: The Gathering, although I'm just casual and get beat a lot. :( but oh, well.

Oh! I almost forgot! I'm also a musician! I play the drums, ever since I was a kid I loved making noise, banging on pots and pans. Now I just sound good doing it.

And I have pictures now!

Anyhow, the thing is, I'm not entirely forever alone because I do have a great group of friends and family but, I have awful awful awful taste in men and I figured maybe this would be better. As they say here, the crop ain't ripe for the pickin', and I'm casting my net elsewhere. 

I may post a pic later, right now I'm not wanting that to be what draws anyone in. I'm cute, in shape, a health-nut. I am about to graduate college with a BFA in Communication Design. I love to paint, (seriously, not those dumb flowers and fleur di lis crap) and I love to be around awesome people. I love to entertain my nose, I have an addiction to perfume. I hate sitting around not doing anything if I'm alone (I have nervous energy, or as I see it, a drive to make my life matter before I kick the bucket). I like clean places. I dress how I feel. I LOVE MUSIC and driving with the windows down on the interstate.

I drop people (friends or boyfriends) like a rock if they treat me in such a way that I would never treat them. That's my only rule of judgment. 

If I can't connect with you intellectually then sooner or later I will go mad and it would just be bad for both. 

Edit: I'm irish-ish, I like to drink (vodka). I also hate cold weather, and I prefer to bake/bask in the sunshine (although not to tan, I wear sunscreen b/c I'm fair skinded.)

Just to clarify, by the way, I've been in London since I was fourteen, so it's not a recent thing- you really don't need to ask me if I'm enjoying the city!

My name is actually pronounced Teara, but I have no idea how to do the necessary accent thingy, so Tara it is. Most people who know me call me Tarabear.

I'm looking, hopefully, for a girlfriend from here; I know, from Reddit? But stranger things have happened, I guess.

I'm a big girl with huge boobs. I thought this might be relevant :p

I like books. I love old books. I like reading, especially on rainy days, with the sound of the raindrops outside, and a mug of hot chocolate. I like old detective stories, and thrillers, and books that really grip me so I can't put them down.

I like most kinds of movies, except really slow foreign ones, or ones that are full of gore. I can cope with horror movies, but I can never be alone in the dark after.

Speaking of the dark- I cannot sleep unless I'm in complete silence, and total darkness, or as close to it as possible.

I have a cat called Grumbles, because he does.

I like most music, except most modern stuff, and rap/hip hop, etc. I'm most fond of the swing-era stuff, though there's nothing better than air-guitar-ing to some 80s music.

I like to cook, especially for other people. I have maybe a dozen recipes I can cook well, about half of which I basically created, or heavily adapted from others.

I have weird eyes- sometimes they look blue, sometimes green, sometimes grey.

I was born and raised Catholic, but I don't really believe in it.

I have a accent that's cute and little, just like me!

I'm not sure what else to say, and I don't want to say too much, so go ahead and ask me!

I'm just trying to see who's still out there and such that might have an interest in chatting.  My schedule has opened up due to a shift in work, so I can actually try and pursue connections if they're there.

One thing I like to put out there is... I'm very enthusiastic about my fandoms.  I have a tattoo to commemorate my personal Harry Potter House.  I'm always down to dress up in costumes for movie releases (Wish I'd had the chance for Avengers), and one day my ultimate display of fandom is my hope to construct my own set of Bio-booster Armor Guyver 'armor' like I've seen others do for conventions.

I'm a gamer in most sense of the word except for gambling. I'm an immense lover of Magic the Gathering, D&amp;D, and WoD. I play both console and PC-- lately I've been trying to get trained up at Starcraft while I save up to buy Diablo.  Though, I can't say it's all I do... I have a soft spot for playing Borderlands quite often. Fighting games are my house, you step in my house, you're gonna get stepped on-- so obviously, I squeal like a little fan girl at the mention of Tekken vs Street fighter (and vice versa) + Soul Cal V. My one dream come true would be for Hudson studios to make another Bloody Roar-- that and for the US to ever actually have a glimmer of hope to get FFXIII VERSUS.
I guess-- the whole point is, I'm just a big load of awkward nerdiness and I want someone to share it with. I want a guy that wants to go to really crap movies so we can serve that stuff like it's an episode of Mystery Science Theatre. I want my partner in crime to make 'Not as Gay as Twilight' jokes with, and never miss a beat. I want someone to have sword fights with me and my wooden boken collection-- or to go out and play lazer tag.

I'm looking for my best friend, I've been looking for him for 23 years. If you see him, let him know this blond girl in Vegas is looking for him. She might not be the skinniest, but she makes up for her aesthetic downsides with the mind blowing passion she'll drown him in. Oh, and tell him he's gonna get his ass whipped at any Video Game he chooses.

I've been going back and forth on whether I should do this or not, but hey, couldn't hurt right? I'm a 24 year old living in Indiana, and let me tell you, it's slim pickings for a girl like me. I'm not into racing or rednecks, i'm kind of a nerdy chick, so i've had a lot of bad luck. First, a little about me:

*I'm 24 years old, freshly graduated with a BA in art and a minor in theater design (costuming). I'm a seamstress, though I would love to be a costumer full time. 

*I adore horror movies Nightmare on Elm St is my favorite! my friends describe me as ""creepy"" because i have an attraction to strange and unusual things. (you might see my name on the ""creepy"" boards a lot haha!) but on the outside i'm not that scary, trust me :D

*As I've mentioned before, I'm kind of a nerdy/geeky chick. I like cartoons, I'm a casual fan of anime (I don't claim to be an otaku, i just like a couple of really good animes), and I dabble in comics and Lovecraft. 

*Alright, what does she look like? well, if you listen to my friends I'm skinny, but I'm not skin and bones. I'm **average** and healthy. medium dark brown naturally curly hair (and i mean CURLY!) hazel eyes, a nose, a mouth, some appendages, ect. ect. I can send a photo if you pm me, but NOT for anything sexual, so don't even ask!

*I don't claim to be a 'gamer chick' but if you have a system and ask me to play i'll give it my best shot and have fun doing it :D

*I'm an avid reader, mostly fantasy and horror, but i dabble in others as long as it isn't romance. or twilight. 

Alright, now down to the nitty gritty. Anyone who's interested in me i have to warn you, i might be skittish at first. I was trapped in a 2 yr relationship with an abusive man, and cheated on 3 times. (that's the kind of caleber of men i'm dealing with out here.)  The unfortunate side effect of this is that i'm turned off of any man who looks like him (overweight with a beard), sorry. So, naturally, it takes a while to earn my trust. I'm not looking for a one nighter, or a sex-driven relationship. In fact, trying to get into my pants are a HUGE turn off for me. I want to get to know you, I want someone to laugh and hang out with, to be nerdy with, ect :) 

So, there it is. I feel like I'm really bad at talking about myself, but hey, i tried! I'm open for friendship or something more. PM me if you would like to skype (again, nothing dirty/ sexual PLEASE.) it doesn't matter if your local or long distance, like i said i'm getting duds out here so i'm willing to broaden my horizon :D",,False,,t5_2sdpe,False,,,True,t3_pqbpx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/pqbpx/f4mf_24_yo_selfhating_hoosier/,

I am not real because you can't put a face to me nor do you even know what I'm like...'This person seems cool, open-minded, maybe good to message', you may think because as you're reading this post and the internet girl illusion is gaining some solidity. 

So then you message me...'Whoa! We actually have things in common!! You're telling me there's a girl who likes video games, fantasy sci-fi, and [sucking at]magic?? Wait, she likes zombies too?' Then I'll correct you and say 'Fuck no! I hate zombies! That's why I buy games to kill them off and watch movies dedicated to their genocide and hope the human survivors win!!' Hopefully, those souls who understand my personality will see that when I say those kinds of things, I'm not being rude, I'm just fluent in sarcasm because those souls who do understand...maybe more then understand will lead them to perhaps my number...? But why should I tell you that? Because that's a spoiler :/

I guess by now I should reel back my post into something more traditional. I'm a college student going to graduate in May and hates to really talk about herself because it's all objectify-able. I love to make people laugh and be that person that makes a difference in someone's day if I can help it, I like to tease people that I have an affinity to and I encourage others to do the same because being sweet ALL the time is a bit sickening. I speak my mind a lot especially when I know everyone is feeling the same, but I try to keep it under control in a tad bit more serious situations. Interest wise, I love art, music, games (cards, boards, video games, etc),traveling in and out of the country, and so much more. Sorry if I don't sell myself well to be this amazing, interesting person, but I decided to create a post because the guys I meet ignore any intelligent pieces of conversation I have to offer and ask if I could show them my genitals instead...so hopefully, HOPEFULLY I can find someone who is somewhat likeminded like me.

So let me help you out. If you're down for late night bingo, winning some cash, bar hopping and pretending we're out of towners where we must switch up our accents and identities at each place, then find a grassy soccer field to ramble about how deep our thoughts are when we're really just drunken fools instead and go to the nearest hotel for free breakfast....or to catch a coffee that's alright too, then you should consider messaging me. And if you don't know how to start you message, you should tell me something that you're very, VERY passionate about and tell me all about it because I would love to hear about it :)!! Perhaps I will reply with a picture if all is well. Sorry for the long message.

Kinda makes me sad but oh well, I'm forever alone at the moment so it doesn't really bother me.

Uhh I'm never good at writing about myself but um... When I'm not thinking about stuff that stresses me out, I enjoy watching old Nickelodeon's cartoons on Netflix, or random movies. I'm a big nerd at heart. I play League of Legends, just started Guild Wars, and I bought but have not yet learned Heroes of Newerth. I also own a ton of Steam games (same as username). Edit: I also play Pokemon SS &amp; Black, but I don't have access to WiFi :(

Oh, and I saw someone looking for V, and a comment said Velociraptor, so if you're one, I'm totally down with hanging out. No discrimination, just love for everyone out there. I'm not shallow in the least bit, and I may seem shy in the beginning but I'll open up with some time.

I don't drink or do any drugs (a huge reason why I'm forever alone, my college is just full of alcoholics). I have at one point enjoyed D&amp;D 3.5E, but I haven't seen my group since before Christmas. Anyway by now you can probably tell I'm extremely awkward. Hopefully you're awkward too!

I'm not down for a relationship right now, but occasionally I miss kissing. That's probably all I miss, actually. Well, after saying all that, let me know what you think, no matter how harsh. :)

But I know that breaking into the business is damn-near impossible, so I’m pursuing other things that I can have one of those weird “job” things in the future. Being into reading probably goes without saying after writing. I also dabble into a bit of photography, acting, and a tiny bit of digital art. 

I’m a total pop culture junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially low brow comedies, stuff that makes me cry, musicals, and documentaries. I like all kinds of TV shows, from guilty pleasures to the most well written. My favorites are Game of Thrones, Adventure Time, 30 Rock, Community, Weeds, Unites States of Tara, Breaking Bad (I’m not finished with this one yet though….), and probably a bunch of others that I’m forgetting.

I've had one boyfriend before and I broke up with him because intelligence wasn't really his strong suit. Anyway, I figured I would give this a shot.

About me:

* I live in South Jersey.

* I'm an atheist and would prefer someone who isn't religious. 

* I am a nursing student at Widener University.

* I don't like romance. It just makes me feel uncomfortable.

* I basically live on Tumblr. 

* Intelligence and personality is everything to me. 

* I feel very, very, very strongly about gay rights. If you don't support gay rights then you don't really want to talk to me. 

* I love to write and I'm fairly good at it.

* I love tattoos as well.

Also, weird fact, I also have this strong attraction to drag queens.

I like to read and watch movies. I'm a homebody for sure. I also love cooking and finding new things to try. I'm 5'1'' and bigger. Won't lie. I like to have fun.

Lonely geek in Chicago area",18,1,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/o9vqk/f4m_well_what_can_i_say_lonely_geek_in_chicago/,"I guess over the last few years, I've been so happy but I've been getting lonely because I have no one to share my joy with. I don't want a partner because I want a partner. I want a partner because I want to make them happy...we'd both be happy together, at least that's the idea.

Anyway, I'm a 20 year old American-Mexican living in Chicago but currently studying in OH (EAS Major). I'm a big geek (not a nerd, I'm sort of dull witted when it comes to science/math). I love video games like Zelda, L4D, Gears of War, League of Legends, lots more! I'm up to try anything at all. I'm also a big fan of anime/manga but I'm not a weaboo nor do I like to talk about it 24/7. But if you do, that's cool too. 

I'm not very active but I do like to partake in sports, especially Martial Arts, Boxing, and Swimming. I'm currently doing Aikido for winter. I'm about 4'11/5'0 and weigh 188 (I think) so I'm pretty hefty, but I can still move - I have control of my legs, my arms, and I can climb up stairs without keeling over. I do have a chubby face though so...there's that. I generally prefer slightly chubby guys or men with chunk because I find it cute - but I am all for promoting and trying to live a healthier life style. 

I'm not very girly...AT ALL. So if you're looking for that, I'm not one to talk to. I have my hair very short but I might grow it out again. Ehm, I'm not religious but I am a bit spiritual, if that's any concern. So please, let me know if you'd like to chat or something. :) I generally prefer people aged 20-30 so yeah...height doesn't matter, but no one shorter than me, please. ^^;

&lt;3 Looking forward to hearing from someone, even if it's just a friendship thing. I always like friends. :3

My hobbies are...well..there's lots. I like astronomy, and basically learning about new developments in physics and space. yup...I'm a dork :)

I'm a skier, scuba diver, roller coaster fanatic, and love to take vactions to the beach. 

I like to read, just about anything. Anything with a good story to it. I enjoy spending time outside and out on the lake during the summer. I like going out on the town with the friends...we always bring back good stories :)

I like going to broadway. I've seen Phantom, Wicked, Les Mis just to name a few. But any form of entertainment ranging from movies to plays to musicals. 

My goals are basically to be happy and to make others smile. Not to descriptive, but simple. Thats all anybody could ask for anyway isn't it? 

I am a trustworthy person. Kind, caring, and a listener. But I'm also very outgoing, and friends with everybody (everybody is a potential friend :) ). I can go from the guy that lends his shoulder to the life of the party. I'm generally a happy person, that sometimes carries his heart on his sleeve. 

I was raised to be the kind of guy that holds doors, or just generaly be a kind person. Just the act of saying hi to somebody, could make their day. But being a gentlemen, should be a habit, chivalry is not dead.....it just became less common.

I like all kinds of music. I don't really dislike anything, musicwise.

All and all, I'm an all around cultured guy, who likes the outside, but above all...I do what I can for the smiles. I know useless triva..the kind of stuff that's cool to know...but won't get me food anytime soon :) I'm going to the gym to get a heathlier lifestyle up and going. 

I've bought a house a couple yrs ago, and since then, been living alone, thats the whole bachlor lifestyle that I'm going to the gym to work off :) I like to hike, and go camping whenever. There's always something to do, at all times of the year. 

I'm a smart, funny, sometimes sarcastic, but I always make things fun and interesting. I really enjoy understanding different points of view, learning about different cultures and religions (I'm also a bit of a political satire...ist :) . I also love to talk to people about anything in general, but a person that can have intelligent conversations with is hard to find.

TL;DR I'm cool, but not nearly as cool as I would be, if I was with someone that was awesome :)

ok i am 35 years old, i have a mild form of Muscualr Dystrophy which by its nature is just getting worse and affecting my quallity of life more.

i am no longer able to go to crowded places as even someone knocking against me tends to knock me off my feet. so places like clubs and bars where people are drunk are out for me.

anways i am posting here to see if anyonw wants to chat and generally get to know someone who used to love music and clubbing etc but is no longer able to do it. given the nature of  my condition meeting people is getting harder, however the only real thing i cant do is stairs, i walk with a stick but apart from that i am a normal functioning human being. is anyone willing to take a chance and see me for what i am.

pm me if you want to chat, flirt, or just kill some time.

so my basics are 35 yr old male from Glasgow Scotland, 6 2"" and about 11 1/2 stone

dark eyes broad shoulders

loves music, house music, 60/70's psychadelic rock trip hop and all sorts of other good quality tunes.

into films tv and other such stuff so chatting shouldnt be a problem.

i love to chat about anything and everything. love reading and i have been known to write the occaisonal dirty little story (i occaisonaly get very frustrated ;) )

anyway this is now a ramble pm me your thoughts.

Where I am from, there is a type of get-together that is sort of like a group blind date. If you an unfamiliar with it, Wikipedia explains it as so:

&gt;In Japan, a gōkon (合コン?) is a group blind date, typically used to form at least some friendships between two groups that are each of a single sex. Generally, a single man and woman who know each other organize the gōkon in advance, each agreeing to bring three or four eligible friends. The venue is usually a restaurant, izakaya, or anywhere people can eat, drink and make a bit of noise... group dating is becoming more popular as a safe alternative to single dating (especially blind dating), also helping to ease tension, because both parties will feel more comfortable having the company of their friends.[1]

It is very popular in Asia, and I think it is a great way for people to meet face-to-face without danger or awkwardness, but I am not sure how well it will translate to western culture (as the majority of the users on this website is in North America.) I see there are a lot of shy people on Reddit, and I want to host one of these events so the introverts can meet other introverts.

It is different than a general meet up, as everyone there will have the desire to find a partner, so situations such as chatting up a married woman will not occur.

Would this be something you would be interested in attending? Does it sound better than posting on a r4r subreddit in hopes that someone will respond? Would it be popular or at least gather 8 males and females to hold one to test it out? Any suggestion or advice if I were to hold one?",,False,,t5_2sdpe,False,,,True,t3_1451gn,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1451gn/r4r_question_would_you_attend_a_gokon_group_blind/,

I frequent places like DeviantArt, Tumblr, Reddit (well..I guess you knew that [for the record I've been here for over a year]), and all those other hipster art places I suppose.

Hmm, what other interests...I like motorcycles and old american muscle cars, mostly for their looks, though I have a fondness for european supercars (I may not know much about them, but c'mon, who doesn't love looking at the zonda?).

I might not be the sharpest crayon in the kit, but I'll do my best to keep up with you intellectual Reddit types. Drop me a line on here, I'll try not to recede into my hermit-like habits and instead start a conversation. If you want.

I have Redbreast and Dalwhinnie in my apartment and at some point will grab a bottle of Macallan 18. I love seafood, and I'm originally from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. You should probably understand the sacred nature of a crab feast in the summertime. I listen to a variety of music, like We Are Scientists, Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party (Pioneers is an amazing song), Shiny Toy Guns and Fall Out Boy. I tend to sing along to Weezer and The Distillers.

My interests are mostly outdoor: I love to hike. I love to explore in general. Some days I just feel like staying inside and watching a movie and snuggling ... [myself :(] I would love to go camping with someone and snuggle near a camp fire. I've been alone for too long: I mostly just want someone to share my life with. I like playing RPGs too. 

I wrote this a while back in a state of deep depression and loneliness 
http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/gmckv/i_just_want_to_be_loved/
So this reflects some of my personality. Admittedly it is a bit embarrassing to look back on. 

Why I'm forever alone: depression and somewhat awkward social skills. 

What I like in a potential SO: 
I want a genuinely sweet person who would also be patient and understanding of my depression. I would definitely return the favor with LOTS of love and make it worth it. The trait I want above all us is sincerity and a genuinely caring heart [Not to be bitter but this really does eliminate about 90% of people on OkCupid]. 

Other pluses though: 

*Introversion

*420/Psy friendly [I'm not someone who does psys / weed every night but occasionally I enjoy a trip. A few times a year sort of thing.]

*Likes to think about weird things and/or has a unique worldview


*Intelligence. Not like genius level, but enough to have conversations that have some depth to them. 

*Lives somewhat near by. Anywhere farther than NYC or central Pennsylvania would be too far. Close enough to at least visit on weekends.

I'm really into reading and writing and storytelling in general and in all forms. I tend to forge bonds with people when we overanalyze elements of our favorite books/movies/music/tv shows together. I'm into the how's and why's of pretty much everything I encounter. I think the odd little stories/anecdotes that fill up the corners and junkdrawers of our brains are what makes us really interesting and unique. I love deep thought just as much as I love dumb jokes. I'm a hopeless romantic; I'm very affectionate and am always dreaming of goofy mushy things. I think of myself as an optimist, and I truly believe that all people are good, even though I have my fair share of jaded, bitter moments. I am a total extrovert and all-around people person; my current job involves LOTS of talking to people and so does the career I'm currently in school for. Oddly, in my personal life, I tend to gravitate toward small groups. I prefer afternoons watching cartoons than nights out in clubs AND I don't think I'm superior/special because of that. I'm fascinated by people with interests/hobbies/backgrounds/religions that are different from my own. I am very in touch with my emotions and cannot keep secrets or pack things I'm feelings away. I'm not that big of a gamer (except for Animal Crossing, that's my JAM) which I know is a negative for most, but I really enjoy watching others play and hearing them talk about games they like. I like cute things just as much as I like creepy things (If I hadn't found the academic field I'm going into, I would've seriously considered going to mortuary school and becoming an undertaker).

I promise I'm not an uptight person at all, but my shyness/awkwardness gets the best of me most of the time and when it doesn't, my tendency to randomly disappear into my own hole always gives off the wrong message.


people frighten me- not in the extreme kind of way, but I always get a feeling they want something from me that I can't give them. 
I generally do not have enough mana to deal with everything IRL.


Of course, the next logical solution to my loneliness is to find a special friend online; there are no bad people on the internet.



(jk- about the last sentence)




I have posted here before and after I got bombarded with responses, I promised myself I'd never post here again. So I lied to myself, but this time I'm not posting my picture until I see YOU... Yes... It sucks, but it would be worse if I lied; I'm quite shallow.




Now that I got all that off my chest, I guess I'll mention that I'm a huge Beatles fan. I pretty much listen to nothing else apart from some indie rock, rock rock, ska, old country music and rain. I don't watch TV, or any series. What I do watch are specific channels on youtube such as minutephysics, vlogbrothers, scishow, pewdiepie, and a bunch of others I can't think of.




I like my humor dark...sometimes very dark- just like my coffee. 




Hey read this post that's, like, totally in chronological order, yo!




I really need someone... I don't want to keep losing people just because I shy away without warning... I'm in a shitty situation in my life and I need some sort of support. Days ago, my whole plans for the next years of my life crashed before my eyes and I can't bring myself to blame my ""best friend"" because he lead me on and lied. I'm not a sad sack of potatoes, but so much shit has been happening for the past 14 months and I don't think I'm able to take any of it anymore...

To be honest, I'm not looking for anything romantic right off the bat (although I'm certainly open to it somewhere down the line).  I like getting to know people first, before jumping into anything.  

And this is the part where I talk about myself:

* I'm a bio major living in LA.  I love all things science, especially things related to physiology &amp; astronomy.
* People tell me that I'm quite the warm-hearted person.  I've definitely got a gentle soul.  I've always been attracted to people who are also kind - not because it's what's more acceptable in society but because they feel like it's the right thing to do.
* I have a lot of typical nerdy interests - lots of TV shows (I love comedies &amp; dramas), lots of books, comics, some light gaming, etc.  
* My sense of humor can sometimes be really corny, haha.  But I love to laugh and am able to find amusement in a lot of things.
* I'm a lifelong learner and things such as passion, open-mindedness, communication, and honesty are really important to me.
* And a bit about me physically, if you're curious: 5'4"", Korean, relatively slim.

If you do send me a PM, please tell me about yourself!  Seriously, I love listening.  The more, the better.  Oh and I don't know about you, but I like putting names &amp; faces together.

Some stuff about me:

* I love graphic novels &amp; comics. //points to username
* I also enjoy reading in general.  My favorite book is 1984, favorite series is A Song of Ice and Fire.
* I'm a bit of a TV addict.  My favorite shows include Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Arrested Development, Batman: The Animated Series, 30 Rock, Sherlock, and Community, to name a few.
* I gravitate towards both creative, expressive types and science nerdy types - I have a deep appreciation for both art and science.  I don't think they're mutually exclusive at all.
* I take joy in the simple things in life.  Life can definitely be messy, but I try to keep things as straightforward and uncomplicated as possible.
* I'm quite openminded and like hearing other people's opinions, thoughts, and feelings on anything.

I had relationships and friendships in the past but have somehow got lost along the way and lost everyone. I can't seem to connect to anyone around me and this frightens me as I had a good social life a few years back. I am confused with life and not sure what to do anymore. I reach out plenty but can't seem to get any decent responses.  

I smoke weed to get rid of the anxiety and be able to focus on anything for at least an hour till it hits me again. I want to quit but really have nothing else to do with my time and can't seem to find a replacement. When I am with people around me I can hold back and fight the anxiety and everything as long as I promise myself relieve at the end of the day. Bought a motorcycle last year thinking it would ""fix"" me temporarily till I regain control of my life but it gets ridden maybe once a week due to life. 

I spend endless hours watching tv shows just to make time go by faster. I just sleep, eat and go to work. All the hours in between I fill with reddit, shows, weed and video games just so the day would end. Job sucks but who's job doesn't? I am currently unmotivated to do anything but breath and eat. What a life huh...?  

So, I got all of that out of my system for the first time ever. My loneliness is leading me down the road of depression among other things. I don't have insurance yet so I am holding off on professional help. I think a few good friends would fix me right up.

Some of you may know me as Lurkin_Lobster, if you frequent the FA IRC chat. (And if you don't, stop by, we have a great time in there.)

I'm 28, and here are some great things about me!

I have a job. I work nights at a family shelter. Not gonna make me rich but I like it.

I have an apartment with a roommate. 

I talk A LOT. This is not a great thing for everybody, but I am actually funny once in a while and you will have great fun trying to figure out what in the wild blue fuck I might say next. I also have ADHD so conversational segues are sometimes nonexistant. 

Hmmm. I listen to a lot of rock music, I read a lot, I play bass guitar (crappily, but its still fun, screw it). I don't watch a lot of tv, I can cook decently, I'm very independent. I love learning how to do new things and my famous last words will probably be ""NOOOOO!!!!! I WANNA DO IT MYSELF!""

What I am looking for (and there is flexibility here, please don't think this is ironclad):

A man (obviously). I prefer to date guys my own age or older-I have been through a lot in life and although some of you younger guys are beyond nice, it's hard for me to date you. Please don't take that personal.

Please, please, please, for the love of fuck, have a job. You don't have to be rich, I'm not, but at least be able to take care of yourself. I'm not the type that will empty your wallet, I hate that shit, either to do it or have it done to me.

Honesty. It's key. If I find out you lied to me about something...see you later. I will answer absolutely ANY question you would like to ask me. Also, if you come to me to tell me something that you think I am going to be unhappy about, I usually can respect your honesty enough to have a rational conversation about whatever it is. I promise.

It would be nice if you didn't live at home with your parents, this isnt a deal breaker though. This one is more a case by case scenario.

Things I award bonus points for:)

If you are musical-either you play or listen a lot. I love music and being able to share it with a SO would be so awesome.

You are spontaneous. That kicks so much ass.

You have ADHD. I have so much fun with others who have it...I really do.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST...PICS OF ME!

I am absolutely terrified. 

What am I looking for? Well, like any lonely soul this area, I want to give a damn about someone, preferably someone who is both friend and lover. I want to care, I want to feel, I want more than just the butterflies in my stomach that will inevitably fade because that's what happens when you fall in lust. It is so difficult to find that connection, even harder still to coax it into something lasting. Every day spent surrounded by people, doing this and that, chatting it up, only to come home to nothing except my pup, a few calls for drinks or dinner from ""friends,"" and that's about it. No late-morning cuddle sessions on Saturdays, no tickling, no belly pokes, no laughter, no feeling; there's nothing else left beyond a simple to-do list of chores, errands, and hobbies to waste time with. Worst of all, no one to share what little bit of ourselves we have left at the end of the day. 

About me? Well, as a disenchanted (non-practicing) Catholic, I enjoy some measure of reading, belly poking and snuggles, sports/sporty activities, staying active and enjoying the outdoors, yada, yada, yada. Am more along the lines of the quiet, ""next door"" type who enjoys a beer or a glass of wine, curious and willing to learn, loyal and genuine with a slightly geeky side. No lofty expectations here, just hoping to find something I'm not even sure really exists or at least to discover if everyone else is just a better liar than I. Not the Amazonian type by any means, unfortunately, but I like to think of myself as easy on the eyes if you prefer dark-haired imps. Also, I like pets and you should too. :) They are beautiful creatures with much love to give.

About you? Well, I suppose we should want similar things and lead similar lifestyles. I've no idea really... I don't think there is one mold to fit into, just some similarities that will resonate between us, because we all know that like attracts like. Candor and compassion go along way, no? Yes, I have pics, but being an introvert, I would really rather the both of us feel comfortable first. No, I don't mean endless messaging/emailing, just a little bit of trust between two decent human beings, that's all, before we subject each other to that sort of litmus test and potentially cause undue psychological harm.

Bonus points if you dig Final Fantasy! We all know the best RPG ever made is FFJ6. Favorite character? Celes, of course! Second best RPG? Pfft, ChronoTrigger, duh! Suck it. 

And, you know, if you don't like me, that's okay. Everyone has preferences and don't be offended if I possibly don't like you either. This dating business is batshit crazy and I'm not sure I quite have the hang of it. Don't hate. We're all perfectly flawed and fucked from the start. This probably won't even amount to much anyway.

To start, I'm in information technology, nothing really specific. I'm employed and firmly rooted where I am, for the next few years. I live in the North.

I'm shy but when I eventually become less shy, I open up about things and I guess I can be a little giggly and bubbly. I like video games and the outdoors equally, I don't like to be stuck on either one. I'm not fond of bar scenes, but I think sitting around and playing dungeons and dragons while having some drinks with friends is pretty much an ideal Saturday night.

I guess I think it would be cool if someone just made an effort. I'm a little reclusive but with the right prompting I can be a good companion. I've tried making efforts before, and it's turned into... well, for naught. It's kind of hurt my confidence.

Ive been bringing lizards/reptiles in general, to school since I was in 3rd grade. :l I was a bit of an odd kid. No I was a REALLY odd kid. And was ranked as the weird one among childhood classes too. haha.

But regardless of me loving reptiles way too much, I'm reddit's worse nightmare as in I consider myself Christian. By god a very liberal one, but my beliefs are mine and I wont push them on anyone or accept anyone pushing there's on me. Also I have no qualms if a person isn't of relative beliefs so no worries. :P 

I'm a girl! Another of reddit's worst nightmares! D: Cause we all know their's no girls on the internet. For all you know everyone here could be a *MANNNN BABY*.

Also I'm a huge goof. Tweak, comedian in actions, nerd, ect ect....Sometimes I feel a bit hipster too. Since I'm the only one of my group of friends that's into Google+. Facebook is just too mainstream. -cool glasses-

I work in a sandwich shop that serves ice cream as well. Used to be a bartender until last month but had to give up one of my jobs since being in school full time was kicking my ass. I'm at a community college right now all set up for transfer to another school so have been applying applying applying! I'm a bit late on the school uptake but I'm making progress and have the determination prestige to do something great! And no one can stop me now! The world can come at me bro! I'm studying Art and Business or English. Leaning more towards the English side though the Business side would be smarter. :l 

I like that classy repetitive stuff all that's all the rage with kids these days! Like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLC8y_myEZc) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PSBwHeVCok).
haha. 

Actually I've always liked this music. but really I love anything. Soundtrack and electronic/house are just my two favorite genres of all the music genres. Also [Electro Swing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJFrqOMgvBI) music is FANTASTIC! Makes me feel like one classy mofo. 

I like to go to clubs and or raves when I can. Enjoy dancing! I party every once in a while and at least know how to have a good time. But not all the time.  Ent friendly to an extent. I'll join when I feel like it but it goes the same with drinking for me. Special events or parties and budgeting my time so it doesn't interfere with school and life itself. haha 

 I love aquariums, hiking, fishing, doing STUFF. Considering I know many people who actually don't do anything, I usually end up doing something myself or hiding at home for the remainder of a day, week, month. Whenever I decide to crawl out of the cave. 

I like philosophical discussions and video games. :D in fact I collect philosophy books, and games? RTS's are my favorites among them. But will play mmos, rpgs, fps's, driving( Mostly a PC gamer as of late, but also PS3 and Xbox. Have a grudge against nintendo...sorry) . Favorite games are silent hill, alan wake, and bioshock. Completely in love with horror games despite how scared shitless I can get sometimes. haha. 


Hmm... now what are some other worst nightmares of reddit? I'm sure I fit in some of them somewhere. I'm conservative in that I wont ever be showing off on Gonewild like many of the people here gawk over. I love the community but hate its negativity and selfishness sometimes. But hey that's life outside the internet as well. 

I'm a person who talks to people O____O but am forever alone in the fact that I have no close friends to really connect with or even people to consider dating. Just coworkers and mutual respect/social skills in some regards.

But because of my quirkiness sometimes I'm the kid in the back who everyone picks on. Oh life. I'm not too hurt about it though. I just don't care if someone doesn't like me. :P why get your panties all in a bunch over it, you know?

Well, let's just get to it, shall we?

I tend to push people away because of my insecurities, resulting in my forever-alone-ness.  So now, I'm 21, never been kissed, and I overthink every opportunity to engage in a healthy, non-platonic relationship.  It's like once someone expresses the slightest interest in dating me, I immediately panic and jump ship.

Maybe I'm oversimplifying things, but I think that if one of you were willing to talk it out with me, I wouldn't be so terrified of being a bad kisser or an awkward date, and I would be able to venture out in the 'real' world and attempt it in an uncontrolled environment.

**Edit:** Someone asked for my ""stats"" so here goes:

Age: 21.6 years old

Gender: Female

Ethnicity: East Asian

Anywho!! I've jumped into keto about a month ago (11lbs down, what what? Seriously, if you haven't, check out the [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto)) and I've finally reached the point where I'm ready to hit up the gym.  Yet, despite this assumed readiness of mine, I can't bring myself to go as much as I'd like to! So you know what I need? I need an accountabilibuddy!

Now, now, this isn't just about me. I want to motivate you too! Let's motivate each other, together, totally not alone! Do be serious about this though. I want us to both see results. We **can** become that person we want to be. I will push you, but I swear it's going to be fun! It's just, the last thing I need is someone jumping on board only to moan and groan before I even hit start on the treadmill. I have my sister for that.

Now that that's out of the way, onto the other things! We won't *only* work out and fret over calorie counts. I'd also like to get to know someone I can geek out with! My console of choice is the PC, and like the frugal-being I am, most of the games I play are freebies. My current obsessions include League of Legends and Minecraft, but generally MMORPG's are more of my thing. (Did you know Phantasy Star Online 2 is hitting the NA shores in January? Jeebers, I can't wait!)

Welp, this post is starting to get a bit lengthy, so I'll try cutting it short. Weight loss and vidya games clearly aren't all there is to me. I'm currently a full-time student majoring in CompySci...or Accounting. I know, technically they're pretty damn unrelated but I've found myself taking classes for both. I don't know, maybe I'll double. Initially, I wanted to go into animation, but I feel simply isn't practical de...gr... I'm suppose to be making this short!!

Err... I talk alot. Anyway, send a message if you're interested! Be ready to break a sweat - seriously. And here's a [picture.](http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y88/Pashtaro/choppercosplay.jpg) Of course it's a cosplay picture, did I not express my geekery? ~~Points if you recognize the character.~~ And yes, I'm black.

I've done long distance a lot actually, and I'm okay with it. I can make it work. 

I've had trouble finding guys that are okay with me having a child. I don't necessarily care about anyone being close to my age (although it can't be a huge difference.) I just feel like I have trouble connecting with guys around here. Most of them are just into partying (I do it too, but I'd like to do more than that.) I like to learn constantly and discuss what's going on in the world. It seems like it's getting increasingly hard to have an intelligent conversation with someone.  

I have a 2 year old daughter full time. I'm returning to college next fall, and make my income by watching kids. 

I love video games. Xbox mostly but I'm hoping to invest in a PS3 sometime soon! Spending a Friday night playing MW3 together while drinking and just hanging out sounds like a great time to me. I love to read and write. There is definitely more to me than meets the eye and I'd love for someone to take time out to get to know me. I don't think they'd be disappointed ;)

Below is some pictures. I currently have dark hair, just got it back to it's natural hair color about a month ago, so that's why I attached a picture of myself blonde as well. If anyone is interest in friends or more, I'd love to hear from you!

I'm Dave. I'm 24.

**What am I?**

I'm a dichotomy. I'm hard-headed, hot-headed, level-headed, big-headed. I'm passionate about things until I'm not. I'm curious all manner of things and people until I know enough to lose interest, or know all I want to. I'm impulsive, compulsive, repulsive. I collect things that don't have any meaning except the fun of it- paperclips, old five pence pieces, newspaper clippings of pictures of squirrels.
I'm spontaneous, and unconventional. I'm equally happy reading a book in a poky cafe, than I am swan-diving off a cliff into clear blue water. I crave adventure, excitement, thrills; I seek out cosiness, conformity, normality. I'm wild, and untamed, but only in the way that a pre-domesticated animal might be; though it frolics in the fields, it longs for a lounge, hungers for a home.
I like old books, old movies, old music, old wine. I like the smell of an old bookstore, the sound of a babbling brook, the smell of rain on fresh-cut grass.
I hold ideals and principles close to my heart, but only until I get bored with them. I have strong opinions about things sometimes. I have no opinion most of the time. I dominate conversations by saying nothing. I thrill people when I open my mouth. I gesture when I speak, even if I'm not saying anything but words. I smoke because I think it makes me look cool, not because I like the feel of the smoke filling my lungs.
I move to my own groove, dance to my own beat, click my fingers and shuffle my feat to the sound of music only I can hear. I shirk duties, bend rules, all because it pleases me to be just that little bit different, to ignore how society views me.
I don't care what people say, except when I do, and I do all the time.
I am shrouded in mystery. I am laid bare for all the world to see.
I'm pretentious like a perfume advert, all fancy words and pretty phrases and pretty faces, and nothing is actually told.
I'm all show and no substance, like a carnival barker; all patter and misdirection, to hide the fact there's nothing really there.
I'm complicated. I'm simple. I'm me.


**What do I want?**

I want someone to challenge me. Someone to have loud drunken discussions with, where glasses are waved and drink is spilled, but we don't care because we're too busy building up the sexual tension. I want someone passionate, someone who has fire in their hearts and embers on their lips. I want someone who has certainty. I want someone who won't cling to like a lifebelt. I want someone who has their own world, their own life, whose orbit brings them to me but doesn't expect me to be there all the time. I want someone I can do things with, see things with, be things with. I want a woman who knows precisely how to be herself and does it wonderfully. I want someone with so much knowledge in their heads that they can't keep it all in, but who still wants to know more about the world. I want someone who looks at me with the same kind of wonder I look at them with.
I want someone who wants me.

The longer I squirm out of being in relationships due to my physical inexperience, the longer I *am* inexperienced.  So maybe we can throw our insecurities away and just figure things out together.  

I have to be honest with you, I don't really want to be one of those people who finds their relationship on reddit.  I want a mutually beneficial relationship, so we can both go be confident enough in real life to know what we're doing with someone.

Ideally, you'd be a virgin too, same age-ish, and we could just learn together.

Can't confirm this. Maybe the saying should be ""if you hit 30 without having a crush…"".

Yes, I had a number of crushes throughout my life, but to be honest you can count them on one hand. None of them got any further than getting diverted into the friendzone before even asking out for a date. Which is sad because I'm deeply romantic, though quite socially awkward.

I value intellect, but let's be honest, looks is important, too, and I'm not ashamed about this. But it's the whole picture that matters. You may be a little overweight, but in the overall you may beat any top model celebrity in my opinion. *However* I value more on the personality and intellect, so *please don't send pictures unless asked for!* I first want get to know the other person, their personality. Often when seeing a picture of someone you mentally imaged may shock you in a pleasant surprise.

So a bit about me: I'm a physicist working on his PhD and expanding his cinematic knowledge. Every now and then I indulge myself into the world of some immersive, story rich computer games or captivating science fiction literature. If I want to passively relax I enjoy some TV series, but I have high standards; also I don't own a TV or watch anything broadcast. Yay for Netflix and Hulu! And I tinker a lot electronics.

At least I'm not completely lonely: I got two wonderful cats which live with me since their birth (it used to be a whole family, but 2011 was a very sad year), which keep me company for more than half of my life. Whoever you are, I expect you to love animals. I don't like people who don't like animals and loath those who mistreat them.

Bonus points if you're a scientist, too. John Miles claimed music was his first love. Well, my is science. Science books were my favorite books from early childhood.

(Cue obligatory excuse about my poorly worded interests and hobbies because ""I'm horrible at talking about myself"" --which is true, of course)

Right now I am in university working on a double major in Criminology and Psychology with no idea what I am doing after that. I generally spend my days slogging through classes and lurking around the internet. I also work as a Residence Advisor at my university which is pretty good. It's an interesting job that helps to pay the way through school.

I know a lot of people on here seem to classify themselves as ""Gamers"", and while I do like playing some games, I don't know if I would take on that title. Occasionally playing games poorly? Yes. Carrying on intelligent conversations about them? Not so much.

I used to draw a lot in high school. I'm not very good at it anymore, but I'm trying to get back in to it (I've been rather reliably informed that I need some hobbies other than tv shows and the internet).

My favorite shows are some of the more popular ones; Doctor Who, Firefly, Sherlock, Supernatural, as well as Psych, Teen Wolf (don't hate, haha), and the occasional episode of Castle. Movies are a similar genre/audience as well as superhero movies (my greatest weakness), and I also love movies from my childhood.

I also read a lot, used to play hockey and would love to get back in to it, I want nothing more than to travel, and I love just hanging out doing nothing.

I realize this got a little long winded, but I really want to give people a decent idea of what I like/who I am.

17 (1995) year old girl from Oslo, Norway, here. I'm looking for new friends at the moment, because I've drifted a bit from my friends from breaking up with my (now ex) boyfriend about 3 months ago. 

To start off, I love food, and i love to cook. If someone asks me to make them a sandwich, I will. 

I also enjoy video games (WoW, Pokémon, CoD etc), movies, tv shows, reading good books and relaxing. When it comes to movies, my favorites are Star Wars and about every Disney movie. I love to cuddle and showing people that I care. I study music and my main instrument is singing, as well as playing piano, trumpet and guitar.

To be straight honest, I am diagnosed with depression, OCD and anxiety as well as being a selfharmer. I try to take it day by day at a time, but some days are harder then others. I've been depressed for 8 years and self harming for 6. I am proud to say I'm almost 2 months clean from harming myself! :)

Hence the depression, I like to get away from everyday routines to relax from time to time. This includes just walking, watching a movie instead of going to a party and literary anything that will distract my thoughts!

As for my looks, I am around 5'7"" - 5'8"" and i have short blonde hair. I have hazel eyes and I have a curvy body and a big bum, hahah! I also have 2 facial piercings - Septum and tongue.

So, I began to think, and as usual, the void within me became the sole thought in my mind. I feel that I am always missing something, endlessly searching for the companionship of like-minded people. Especially searching for that one person who is going to fill in the emptiness. I know there are other people like me out there, and I am looking to find a few more. I’ve had some luck through Reddit before, and I’m hoping I’ll be even luckier by making my own post.

If you’re reading this, you’re obviously looking for something.

* Looking for a friend? PM me. I’m always willing to meet new people all over the world!

* Looking for an enemy? PM me. I stand by my views, so we can agree to disagree.

* Looking for some late-night “fun”? PM me. I’m always cool with it, if that’s where conversation leads.

* Looking for a relationship? PM me. I prefer the chubbiest, most teddy-bear-iest bearded gentleman-type with a sense of humor, so if that sounds like you, even just a little tiny bit, PM me, goddamnit.

And this is where I leave you with a short description of myself! I’m intelligent, I’m silly, I’m adorable, I’m thoughtful, and I can be worth your time. I’m also fat AND confident. Deal with it. Ultimately, I am a real person. There’s no bullshit with me. I don’t play games. I don’t pretend to be something I’m not. I’m not the most intelligent person out there, but I’m still pretty damn proud of myself. In fact, I would humbly enjoy speaking with those of you more intelligent that me, as I am always looking to further my experiences in life. That’s always a good way to keep my ego in check. I also have a crazy sense of humor. I love to laugh. Life can be so much fun with the right people. I’m also an electrical engineering student, and I really love to play with robots. I’m also very girly. I dare you to ask me how many pairs of shoes I own. Also, pictures of me are most definitely available if you ask nicely!

So, to wrap this up, I only really have two requests: 1. Be interesting. 2. Don’t be uninteresting. That’s all I need from you to spark some interesting conversation. Now, let’s do this!

Every single relationship I've had has been... weird and extremely frustrated and none of them ended well. I'm almost 23, graduating soon and I'm tired of pointless shit and wasting time and I'm looking for something, well, someone really serious. 

I study and practice archaeology, it's my one passion. When I excavate everything I dig up comes alive to me, I immerse myself in the wonder that thousands of years ago people actually lived and did all those things that were normal to them in the exact spot I'm excavating, finding things that were intimate to them, it's just, wow. Fitness is very important in my life, I have a rigid workout schedule and basically my routine decides what I eat, when I eat, how I sleep, how I plan my day etc. Working out itself is a very spiritual (not religious, just like, brings you closer to your humanity) experience for me. I like to keep myself busy with random stuff, I collect things about subjects that fascinate me, for instance I am CRAZY about 70s culture, and my kitchen is filled with like 40-year old appliances, and I've got an old record player on which I play original LPs, the sound is just amazing. I can spend hours in a record store that has like a back room with second-hand records Other things I fill my time with include mostly watching sitcoms, playing the odd computer game and poking my cat while he is trying to sleep. I AM a social person, sort of, I just don't get out much because I like to do the things that I do, I'm not really shy. What I would like though is someone who can help me discover new things, things they're into, things they like, and discover things with. I have very strong, unwavering beliefs and principles. Free speech is holy to me, so much that I believe the concept of being insulted is just stupid. I believe strongly in the harshness and reality of life, life is unfair and it's up to you to make the best out of it, do whatever the hell you want really. Honesty and trust are also very important to me, in a relationship especially.

What I am looking for is a girl/woman between the ages of 18-26. Someone who knows EXACTLY what they want and stick with it. Someone who is into a mature relationship, no games, no insecurities, you're just two people who have a special bond together and decide to share a great number of wonderful things, which includes your thoughts and feelings. Someone who doesn't get tired of affection and appreciation. Yes, I am clingy, when I believe someone is special and interesting I don't feel there's a reason to not express that and remind that person of just how special she is to me. I'd love to have someone who can sometimes just sit inside all day with me and do nothing at all. Poke my cat together for a while, watch some sitcoms, read something interesting with me, play some music, whatever. I'd love to go out and do couple-ey stuff, but what makes a relationship for me special is that you are just.. together and enjoy things together because it's just... a joint experience. You're not two strangers who are trying to get at something, you're two people in a relationship, you share, you know what you enjoy together, so enjoy it! That brings me to the next topic which is sex. I LOVE sex, I devote myself fully to well, anything I do in bed really. I'm not totally awkward about sex, but I do have a high libido and girls have had the impression in the past that I just wanted them for sex, while for me it's like... a package deal. Sex is an amazing and intimate experience you share and you can do INCREDIBLE things to and for eachother, it's a wonderful part of a relationship, and a relationship with lack of sex is just... empty to me. Like I said before, you share yourselves together, and shutting any part of yourself off for the other is just like you're two strangers. I'm incredibly devoted to any relationship, and sex is a major part of that.

There's so much more I'd like to tell about who I am or what I am looking for, but this is already getting too long. If you're interested, and serious... send me a pm for like, a picture, any questions you want to ask I will answer honestly and whatever else comes to mind.

A bit about me? Well, I'm a student (which is why I live in Waterloo). I'm in my second year of university, and I'm supposed to be studying for midterms. OH WELL!

I like sports, but I haven't really played much (other than intramurals) while I've been in uni. I used to play varsity soccer, and I played volleyball as well too. Fun stuffs. :)

I'm not REALLY a gamer, ANYMORE. I don't have much time anymore for games. School takes up all of my time. :c I just play random games casually now, I'm not really committed to anything at the moment.

As for music, I listen to lots of different stuffs. Mostly video game music and a bit of Korean music too (no, I'm not East Asian). I'm open to anything really, rock, rap, trance, anything. What I've been listening to recently is [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ePT5OlZ7o#t=1m10s).

So I've decided to give this subreddit one last shot, since my posts haven't had much success in the past, most likely due to my penis. (Not the size of it, just the fact that I have one)

Things to know about me:

* I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I'm also a fighter, so don't get any ideas.

* Sometimes I have a bad short term memory, but my long term memory is stellar.

* I work graveyard at a hotel, so I can handle drunk people with ease.

* I also work daytime in a warehouse, so I can handle sober people with ease

* I love theater, I am currently in a musical, despite my lack of singing ability.

* I live in California, therefore I have blond hair and surf to school.

* I still have Backstreet Boys on my mp3 player.

* I'm not gay, despite the last couple of points, though if I was I would support my decision because I love me.

* Sometimes I have a bad short term memory, but my long term memory is stellar.

* I was hiding under your porch because I love you.

* It took 3 tries for format these bullet points.

If any of these are appealing, please leave a message after the tone.

Unfortunately, there's not much to gain by lurking on a subreddit where the target audience is also more than likely lurking &gt;.&gt;

A little about myself, since my post history won't really give much in the ""hint"" department. Generic details: I'm 29, a New Jerseyian born and raised, work in the software industry and I'm a total nerd. There, I said it, and I doubt it will come as much of a surprise to anyone who made their way to this post. I embrace the fact that I'm a nerd, and I honestly hope to find someone of a similar persuasion at some point in the not-so-distant future. Not-so-generic details: I have thoroughly enjoyed being a gamer for as long as I can remember. Sadly, this assertion has me playing Sega Mastersystem when it was still a relevant console. If I had more time, I'd love to spend some of it taking pictures. I really enjoy traveling, it provides a great source for ""perspective adjustment"". My job is great in that I've been able to fly all over the country, but the flip side to that is the fact that I'm usually working late hours wherever I travel.. thus limiting my capacity to take in each location. My idea of outdoor activity isn't watching a sports game live (I loathe almost all sports for one reason or another), it's camping/hiking/road-tripping somewhere for the weekend. I could go on and on.

Plain and simple, I am looking for the nerd girl of my dreams. Someone who understands the finer points of a weekend spent catching up on 1+ seasons of a new show. Someone who embraces who they are, and isn't afraid of it. Someone who is intelligent, quirky, fun, and adorable in their own way... who has a unique personality and has really made it their own.

I've done this once before and got a wonderful response from it. I met a lot of really great guys last time but unfortunately the timing was horrible as my father fell very ill and I didn't get the chance to keep up with everyone the way I had hoped. I thought I'd give this a second try as I'm not going to school full time this semester and would like to find more friends to do activities with. 

A bit about me personally, I moved from Indiana, where I've grown up my entire life, to LA almost 3 years ago. I'm a college student currently studying at SMC and hopefully transferring to finish my last year very soon. I'm a sociology student hoping to do some volunteering abroad soon. I love traveling and just returned from 3 weeks of traveling and hope to do more soon. I can be shy at first but I warm up pretty quickly. I'm really silly and like to laugh and joke around. Although I've been in LA for almost 3 years there's still a load of crap I haven't done yet and that's definitely part of the reason why I'm trying to find more people to hang out with and to talk to since I don't want to spend another year spending more time at home than out. I love going to the beach and I love to take photos so I'm all for activities where I can take a camera. I'm horrible at most sports but hey I'll humor you anyway because I wouldn't dare be rude. 

Basically I'm into music, sports &amp; man do I love the internet. I love my N64, Cruis'n World (&amp; Mario Kart 64) is how i take out all of my anger since I enjoy running people over in all the video games I play. 

Music: Poets of the Fall, Civil Twilight, Ed Sheeran, Alexandra Stan, Wisin y Yandel, Reik, Sara Tavares, Da Weasel, DJ Roger Sanchez, Manufactured Superstars etc. etc. 

Tv: Dexter, anything on HGTV, The Closer, South Park, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Arrested Development, Grey's Anatomy, Modern Family, Royal Pains, Criminal Minds, Law &amp; Order SVU, Skins, Storage Wars (guilty), telenovelas &amp; 90s Nick (I don't need to run down the list). 

Movies: The Avengers, Savages, Maria Full of Grace, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Fast Five, old James Bond movies, Mars Attacks, Snow White &amp; the Huntsman, Iron Man, Batman movies!, The Hangover.

Sports (I watch): Football (Soccer), Tennis, Golf, NFL &amp; Basketball.

• University graduate and currently working full-time (standard 9-5 on weekdays)

• Casual Gamer (Dota2, WoW, D3, SC2, Minecraft and recently LoL)

• Browse Youtube or Reddit when not gaming

• Fan of mecha anime

• Casual laid back but fair personality

• Swear a lot...and I mean a lot

• Have a facebook account but I don't update it

• Good sense of humour, but I draw a line when it comes to quotes directed specifically to an individual

• Skinnier than average, my metabolism sucks

• Not really athletic (I have asthma, if I push myself), but enjoy the occasional sport (I suck) or jog

• Requires glasses

• I am never the kind of person to ""throw the first punch"" when it comes to arguements but I will stand my ground if attacked

• Spiders can go fuck themselves

• Socially awkward and unsure on how to approach ladies

• I don't make promises I can't keep

• Got a thing for slender, ""low-maintenance"" (keep the perfume and make-up low, scares me sometimes), asian girls with pony-tails ;)

Aside from this, I am basically looking for someone to share my hobbies with and have a good time. I am not a very outgoing person out of fear of rejection but I tend to become more open once trust is established, so probably skype or msn would be the best way to start.

I love reddit, as I'm sure everyone on this subreddit does, I like cheesy horror movies and crime dramas (up to a certain point), I like conversation but I hate discussing politics or religion. I also love to travel and I've been to almost half the states in the US and Canada, Mexico, and many parts of Western Europe. I also have a fondness for computer games. I try not to let my computer gaming get in the way of a social life though, and I'm fully capable of holding a conversation with a person or group of people while never bringing up video gaming at all. I understand it isn't everyone's bag. When I'm among other people, we commonly watch movies, shoot the shit, or play poker or Apples to Apples.


Honestly, in my past, I haven't had much luck with women. I can count on one hand the number of actual relationships I've been in, and now that I'm out of college I see the internet as being my best bet for finding someone who shares my interests. I also try bars and nightclubs, but to be honest I find it very frustrating because it's often too loud and distracting to really talk to someone and the drinks are overpriced. I'm not a cheapskate by any means, but when it's several drinks over a long period of time it does tend to add up.
Besides, when I go to a nightclub to dance I like to cut loose and just dance for several hours. It's easily my favorite...well, second favorite...form of exercise.


Here's two pictures of me for reference, I'm the one on the right in both pictures. I no longer wear glasses, had laser eye surgery gifted to me on my 21st birthday.

I'm a college student who totally lacks a social life since I can't seem to be able to make new friends to relate to here in Southern California, so I spend a lot of my time Skyping with friends back East and sports blogging/tweeting...if not browsing reddit or coding a website (though it's been awhile). I also love reading, taking photos, writing and most of all going on long road trips. 

I don't watch too much tv but when I do it's usually something on HGTV, A&amp;E, TNT, The History channel or Nat Geo. Love Music, some older video games (I have an N64 and a Super Nintendo I cherish) and foreign films.

A sexual relationship must be a possibility in the future, but it's not something I want to rush. I just want to connect with another person on a deeper level. 

I am interested in men and women and my preference is based on who you are as a person! In either case I’m looking for someone 18-26. I’ve only dated women, but would probably be more submissive / bottom with another guy if things got that far. 

I’m pretty versatile when it comes to entertainment / things to do. I can enjoy an evening out going to bars and clubs, but I frequently prefer a quiet evening at home.

Uh…Hi.

I’m looking for a guy in the Knoxville area to get to know in a friendship setting at first… and then who knows.

A little about me:

    * Currently a senior at UT with hopes of going to grad school maybe somewhere in California.
    
* I like to read, but haven’t curled up with a good book in a while.

* I frequent r/trees :3

* I apparently suck at video games, but I love to watch people play them. It’s kind of like an interactive movie where you can yell at the protagonist and they actually hear you. I’m getting pretty decent at Super Smash Bros though. Quite honestly, I’d love to actually play video games, but I don’t have a console. If you have some serious patience and can stand a girl getting worked up and cursing like a trucker, I’d love to have someone sit down and show me the ropes.
 
* I get along better with guys than with girls. I have a lowbrow sense of humor. What can I say, dick jokes are funny.

* I'm a bit shy at first, but once I'm comfortable around someone I really open up and my filter disappears. In a good way.

*I love horror movies ( Can’t wait to see Paranormal Activity 3)

My version of a good first date is hanging out, smoking, and cuddling on the couch with a movie on.

I’m looking for a guy to get to know who preferably is either in school or working, who is down to earth, hopefully is an ent, someone who can make me laugh, someone who loves to just relax and is easy to talk to and….fuck I don’t know. Is awesome

Most here would probably not consider me forever alone. I've had plenty of relationships. Some serious, some not. But even when I'm with someone, I feel crushing loneliness. It's almost worse to be around someone who simply cannot understand you. I feel a connection with no one. I'm also seriously lacking in friends, and I have a horrible relationship with my family.

With all of that fun stuff out of the way, here's the run down on me: 

* Math/Philosophy degree, currently studying to be CPA 
* INTJ
* Atheist
* Mix of Leftist/Socialist/Libertarian stances depending on the subject
* I identify with Absurdism (see works of Camus) more than anything else in Philosophy
* I love cars and motorsports (F1, GP2, British touring cars)
* I play piano, flute, and percussion
* I read a lot


In all honesty, I am looking for someone who is like me. I don't particularly care how narcissistic that sounds. Another INTJ with similar interests would be ideal. I really just want someone who can understand me on a deep level. I don't want someone who thinks they understand just because they can hear the words that I am saying. I want someone who can actually relate to me in a meaningful way. I have had a very hard life. I always will. Someone who has experienced their fair share of personal struggle could get it.

I'm not sure how to do these and I'm self-conscious talking about myself for too long, so here goes:

I'm 6'2"", 180 lbs, average build I guess; just a little bit of belly. I do data entry for a delivery company. It's only part-time, but in this economy you gotta take what you can get! I have a car, so there's a bit of independence...

Video games are my big hobby. I've been playing them since my second birthday when I got Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. I'm into action/adventure, JRPGs, roguelikes, text adventures, and platformers.

I also enjoy programming. I know PHP and am learning more about C and Python. I have a few project ideas I'd love to share and brainstorm with others. My endgoal in programming is to make my own video games. I'm aiming to make classic-style 2-D games with modern sensibilities, medium-to-high difficulty, and high replay value.

I don't always read... *but when I do* it's Chuck Palahniuk, Douglas Adams, Oscar Wilde, stuff like that. I've been meaning to read Plato and Aristotle, 1984, Animal Farm, and other classics. Most of the time I forget I own a Kindle and instead end up watching win/fail or prank videos on Youtube. Sound familiar? We might get along.

What I'm looking for is someone who's a bit more progressive and open-minded. Someone not religious. Someone who's been burned and lied to a few times, so they know the value of honesty. Someone who's aware of (or at least tolerant of) gender fluidity. Someone sex-positive.

I'm not one for small-talk, but if you catch my attention with a topic, we can talk for hours! I think a lot about sexuality and gender, game design, philosophy, fulfilling weird curiosities, and Internet politics (seems to be common here on Reddit :)).

I'm into action and comedy movies, though a good thought-provoking drama is just as good to me. I enjoy spades, poker, and billiards, and get really goofy/funny once I open up.

On that note, I've been told I get hilarious when I start drinking. I'm a happy drinker and don't understand why some people turn angry when they drink. I know my limit and hold my liquor well, so if we ever drink together there won't be a mess to clean up. :D

I guess that was sort of awkward... but it's good to know if someone's a stupid-ass or smart with booze, right?

As for the ""relationship type"", it'd be nice to have a serious relationship built on shared passion for something and respect. My past relationships nailed the sexual side but left me out in the cold emotionally and intellectually. Preferably I'd like to nail all three.

I like reading books(SciFi, Fantasy), playing games(COD, HON), and playing sports. (Tennis, running, snowboarding, basketball.)

I've always been a bit of an introvert and I'm looking to break out of my shell a bit and meet some new people. I'm usually pretty good at being social around guys, but girls make me super nervous sometimes. xD

I think i'm decently attractive(??), I don't think i'm hideous or anything at least. I work out and try to keep a clean appearance. A few girls have called me cute over the years. (Although I can never tell if they're just being nice or not.) Anyways, looks aren't a big deal for me, I'm mostly just looking for some online friends to chat with at night?

Oh well, sorry for the wall of text. If you think you may be interested, definitely contact me. :)

Maybe I just made that whole research thing up... Maybe I've posted an almost identical post to this one once before and now I'm trying again, despite some very friendly replies from folks who are nowhere near me... So let's get this thing going without looking into how many ellipses I just used.

I have a full time job with a weird, second shift sort of schedule, which makes it hard to meet people, and that's aside from my social awkwardness. I've tried the online dating thing (okcupid), but that hasn't really panned out recently either. So, I'm here now.

I'm a bearded, overweight (not super overweight, but not really where I'd feel honest saying chubby) guy with a bachelors degree (science) and a strong appreciation of pretty much anything you'd describe as geeky or nerdy (except anime, not sure why, but it just never peeked my interest). And, just to get it out there, I've been in one relationship ever and I've never had sex, which doesn't help my awkwardness with women.

So, I'm looking for someone who's awkward too. Maybe our respective awkwardness can cancel each other out and just leave awesomeness behind. Or it could multiply and destroy half the country in a shock wave of stammering and uncomfortable silences. But I think it's definitely worth finding out which will happen.

I'm looking for someone that can show me the beauty of the world. I feel like society as a whole is changing. The values once held in high regard by many people have given way to drunken shenanigans, drug usage, infidelity, and a general lack of respect for others. Now, I know these things have always existed to some degree, but I feel like all of this has become more prevalent with the advent of (and near dependence on) social media.

That's not to say that I'm some old fogey that wants to abolish women's rights or some stupid thing like that. I'm also not some religious zealot. I just... place more on values than the majority of people I've met in my generation.

About me: I'm a guy who loves anime, gaming, the outdoors, and losing myself in a good book. I was raised by older family members and this is reflected on how I view life. I'm a bit on the chubby side these days (thanks to a depression that I've recently overcome), but that's changing. Relief of stress does wonders for one's metabolism. About you: Intelligent with good moral character and not afraid to fight for what you believe in. If you frequent bars or get high, I can already tell you we're incompatible. Sharing interests is a plus, but we can learn the interests of each other if we feel a connection elsewhere. A keen desire for developing something long-term is appreciated. Also, if you can LITERALLY show me beauty through some awesome photography skills, that would be a major bonus.

SITUATION: I'm 22, a soldier (You knew that; because you can read) stationed at Fort Bliss in oh-so-(oh God, it's too damn hot)-beautiful El Paso, Texas. This is my first duty station, I know no one here, and the people I have been meeting have such incompatible interests to my own that I just can't find any real joy in hanging out with them. I live in a small 2 bedroom apartment alone, so things get just a little depressing 'round here.

ME: I am a redditor. This means you may correctly imply that I like cats, bacon and the internet. Also correct would be video games. My favorite games are the ones with a story that doesn't get in the way of the gameplay. See:

* Fallout 3/NV
* Rune Factory
* Half-Life
* Ragnarok Online (I know that's a stretch)
* inFamous

Contrast with:

* Final Fantasy (HEY DON'T YOU WANT TO STOP PLAYING AND WATCH THIS CUTSCENE!?)
* Call of Duty (Why are you killing everyone? BECAUSE JUST DO IT)

I also enjoy playful/humorous Photoshopping (I am no bueno at it); cooking/food, fine scotch, movies and electronic music. I like to read, with an emphasis on Science fiction and Alternate future/past novels, but have been starting mysteries. No zombies. I also like stars. From both a scientific and beauty standpoint.

YOU: Pulse is a requirement. Reading/Writing English is a must. I'd prefer age between 18-28 ish, to keep interests similar and whatnot. Not especially picky about male or female, I suppose; since the *main* focus is for someone to talk to. Location ain't such a big deal; but if you're local, that's just stellar.

Is that enough detail? I think so.

I've got Skype, Steam and Reddit for contact, but wouldn't be opposed to moving to text/phone or Facebook for the interested. Let me know if you think you qualify!

   Alright, where to start, hm? Well, to begin how about some physical attributes? I am 5 feet and 3 inches tall, and weigh around 180 pounds. On second thought, a [picture's](http://imgur.com/vTciB) worth a thousand words.

   Let's see, now I'll talk about my personality. I like to think of myself as a kind individual that genuinily cares about people. Though I have depression and bipolar, I bounce back from their effects rather quickly. I do my best to encourage the people around me. My family members say that I'm pretty good with my nieces and nephews so I don't think I'm too terrible at handling children.

Now on to my favorite part: interests! I enjoy a lot of geeky things like video games, anime, and general screwing around on the internet. The two games I find myself playing most of the time are Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft. As for anime, I like things like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagaan, Fate/Zero, Kara no Kyoukai, Clannad, and Angel Beats. I also like to play Visual Novels, though the only one I think I've finished is Fate/Stay Night. I'm generally a big fan of anything taking place in the Nasuverse. Music is another big thing I enjoy. Alot of it comes from various animes, Touhou, or OcRemix.

Finally, to talk about what I'm doing with my life. Right now I'm living with my mom and grandfather. I work really hard to maintain the house everyday. I also help to watch my nieces and nephews whenever they come to visit. As you can tell, I really love my family. I recently took a civil service test so that I could get a job as a librarian or some kind of clerk. Also, my sister has been taking me driving so I can finally get my driver's license. I had my permit for about a year but I've never had anyone that could ride with me so that I could practice. Oh, and one more thing. Me and my mom have been trying to get me to a geneticist so that I can find out if I have [Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndrome).

I've got a healthy list of things I'd like to do, including: getting back into skiing, going to Coachella, learning to sail, doing something more ""extreme"" (mountain climbing? vomit comet?)

* I'm well off, good job (software engineer), car, apt, etcetera. Most extra money goes into the ""retire early to a tropical island because nine to fiving sucks"" fund though.

* I don't smoke, drink much, or do any drugs. I'm no straightedge though -- I believe in heavy skepticism of cultural norms along with moderation. I consider myself agnostic -- don't orbit your life around spaghetti monster(s) and we'll get along fine.

* I am looking for a long term relationship, in the sense of going into relationship with all means and intentions towards making it last it's good. I'm also okay with something long distance that won't stay that way. But friends first and all that -- fuck ""dating.""

* I value openness and honesty (I've never talked about some issue and not felt better about it after), a lack of flakiness and waffling offline and online (internet people are people too &gt;_&gt;), a bit of introversion (the easier to relate to you with, my dear), mellow but still a desire for occasional adventure.

* The superficial stuff: 25, white, six foot, thin... screw it, here are a few photos.

* A cross section of my interests: I just finished the Hyperion Cantos (let's hope Hollywood doesn't butcher it, along with Akira) and started Neuromancer. My favorite author ever is Murakami. No one else's writing writing gives me that crazy, strange but totally chill vibe his does. My favorite artist ever are the Chili Peppers. some other good stuff: Elbow, Beirut, Daft Punk, Justice, Sufjan, Gorillaz, The Prodigy, Massive Attack, The Black Keys, The New Pornographers, TV on the Radio. I'd like to listen to more podcasts but I only end up listening to This American Life.

* Cont'd, visual media: Movies and TV are mostly for killing time but I watch your reddit-approved set of shows: Community, Breaking Bad, Dexter, Walking Dead, Game of Thrones. My favorite movie in recent memory is Into the Wild. I watch some anime too and read manga on occasion (I really need to finish Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou). I don't play video games much anymore, but I'm getting Guild Wars 2 when it's released.

* I'm in southwestern CT, an hour outside NYC and 40 minutes outside New Haven.

So yeah, send me a pic and a bit about yourself, and AMA if you please.

I'm a really calm person, it takes a lot to anger or upset me. My humor is pretty dry and sarcastic, and I think I'm fairly quick-witted. 

I play acoustic and classical guitar + write music, attempt to sing ( if required ). I train in muay thai / boxing / brazilian jiu jitsu, and some other disciplines. I've got tons of interests, just ask.

Stuff I like:

TV - Community, Dexter, Futurama, The Simpsons (fuck you its still decent), Arrested Development, Shameless, Misfits, Eureka, Firefly, Game of Thrones, Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Modern Family, etc.

Books - Currently reading a lot of books that are ""classics""; The Art of War, Brothers Karamazov, The Idiot, Crime and Punishment, On The Road, Ulysses, Ender, Dune, Metamorphosis, The Master and the Margherita, Shogun, The Picture of Dorian Grey, etc.

Movies - Lost in Translation, Blade Runner, Brick, Death at a Funeral, Haevnen, Hot Fuzz, Zombieland, Juice, The Professional, Michael Clayton, No Country for Old Men, Oldboy (mindfuck), Se7en, District 9, tons of others.

Anywho, about me...I'm 6'0"", fairly skinny guy with blondish hair and blue eyes, who hates being bored.  Because of that I have acquired an array of hobbies over the years.  I can ride a horse, I know Brazilian Jujitsu, I've performed stand-up comedy, I can build computers, ski on land and water, I played lacrosse for 7 years, and I am a certified scuba diver.  I am also partial to exploring abandoned places and being all around silly.  Don't let that fool you though, I am also a huge nerd.

Things I like: reading, writing, photography, cooking, juggling, cycling, movies (especially horror), cult tv, sarcasm, self-deprecating humour, making out.

My name is Emily. I've posted on here before with little luck. I'm not necessarily looking to find my soul mate on here but someone to talk to as well would be nice. 

A little bit about me: I'm 21, my birthday is December 22! I'm currently majoring in biochemistry and will be going into pharmacy next year, to be a pharmacist, clearly. I currently work in a hospital as a pharmacy technician, I work in a super cool laboratory setting where I make medicated iv bags, most of the time for chemotherapy patients.  I also model a bit on the side. 

I'm not your typical 21 year old that parties her life away. I rarely ever drink, I don't do drugs and I don't smoke either. I may not be a saint once i'm in a relationship but I don't engage in promiscuous sex outside of one. It would be awesome to find a guy that has the same mentality, seems that everyone goes out and has one night stands and sleeps with 30 people by the time they're 24. Being in the pharmacy field, I know how many people catch STD's, so no thank you.

I love the outdoors, rollerblading, wakeboarding, snowboarding, hiking, going to concerts and movies, roadtrips, playing guitar/ukelele and singing! video games cause i'm a nerd  (I play games from call of duty and assassins creed to WoW) and cooking :D i'm a badass cook

well, that's about it for now. It would be cool to chat with a unique nice guy :D It's much more enticing to reply to a message that has a picture attached as shallow as that sounds but it is the internet after all so send a picture and I will reply with one.

I have plenty of pictures of myself to show I'm real. (No crazy angles or Photoshop, I swear!) Those will come after we've chatted a little bit though, but if you send a picture up front I will probably reply with one. (That's etiquette, right?) 


**Interests**

*Gaming:* (I feel like that's default on this subreddit!) I've played WoW since release and currently am in a top-end progression guild. Actually, finding a guy/gal who plays WoW is pretty ""up there"" for me because I feel like getting to know someone by playing the game is super-duper fun.

I also play LoL, TF2, and Borderlands 2. I have a huge list of games that I've played and loved, but really these are what I'm playing currently. 

*Science:* Physics nerd. Learning about the cosmos. Space exploration. 

*Reading:* I'm a voracious reader. A better question here would be what haven't I read.

*Working out:* I'm a bigger girl. (By bigger, I mean that. I'm not saying I'm 300lbs. I have a nice shape but am still overweight) I've made working out and healthy living a top priority in the past month.

*Cooking, music, drinking expensive liquor, traveling.*


**About YOU!**

No slacker types, please. Looking for an exceptionally bright male or female anywhere in the age range of about 23-35. I'm actually okay with a bit older if  you can show me you're young at heart.

Intelligence is probably the most stand-out quality I'm looking for. That being said, if you're a creationist or republican we probably won't get along well. ;] 

I get that we're forever alone, and we all have our issues, but I'd prefer not to be issued a dissertation on your varying mental health issues in your first message.

Also, if you can't bother typing at least a paragraph about who you are or what you're looking for, we might not be a good fit.

I suppose I'm a light hearted young lady fresh out of college and just kind of figuring out the adult world and such. I like to watch netflix, play video games, walk my pet rabbit outside.

It wasn't a very catchy title, I admit, but you're here now so I'll do my best to make it a worthwhile read. I'm a geeky girl who's quite shy of guys IRL. But I've found that it's easier for me to open up online, so why not try out a possible relationship here?

I am a floundering flustered student. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life, but I'm interested in language and writing; I might go for a career in one of those fields. I like having intellectual conversations, but I also like adding a bit of levity wherever I go, so I try to be funny a lot. I'm told that IRL I have a pretty deadpan delivery, which is good and bad. I have a pretty broad sense of humor--dark, ironic, witty, dry, sarcastic, non-sequitur, punny, whatever. It's hard to offend me in that sense, unless you're being deliberately malicious or aiming to ""shock"" for its own sake. I am 5' 6"", 175 lbs and not particularly bothered by it. If you aren't either, great! If you are, please move along: no hard feelings.


Interests: beware, they are many and I love to talk about them. Oncoming wall of text in 3...2...1...I like to watch movies, TV, and YouTube videos. I also like to read, though I don't read as much as I used to. I am a HUGE Potterhead--I read Deathly Hallows in 19 hours. Do not underestimate my Potterfandom. I'll admit, most of what I've read are YA novels, but I have also read House of Leaves, Stieg Larsson's trilogy, and Demetri Martin's This is a Book, so I'm expanding my bookly horizons. Time, specifically the lack of, is the issue on that front. I am physically incapable of naming a favorite movie or TV show--there are too many I love and I enjoy most genres. Off the top of my head: I love Christopher Nolan and Joss Whedon. Perhaps I'll take a picture of my collection of DVDs if you really want to know more. I also love discovering independent movies on Netflix's streaming service. Recently I watched Eagle vs Shark, which I can only describe as Napolean Dynamite in New Zealand. I am in love with British TV, (obligatory Doctor Who and Sherlock shoutout, duh), especially QI, Mock the Week (I miss Frankie Boyle :C), The Graham Norton Show, and Would I Lie to You? I only have access to these shows via YouTube, though, so I'm never up to date. I'm not really into gaming very much, mostly due to lack of money and AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FO' DAT. That being said I used to play Pokemon *hardcore* when I was little (first generation 4eva). I even had the cards, man. My pride and joy was a holographic Mewtwo. Don't ask me what happened to them, it's too painful. I own Terraria and still play occasionally, though I'm not very good. (Perhaps we could play together?) I also really enjoy Pewdiepie videos (what can I say--he taught me how to say ""fucking pussy"" in Swedish, what's not to love?) Oh, and I am a proud Nerdfighter. John Green is my personal Jesus; currently working through his entire body of literary works (good luck to me, did I mention my distinct lack of time?) I will sorely miss 5SecondFilms when they quit. Music: I tend to catch hell for my musical tastes, because many people are pretty serious about music, but I try not to let it be a dealbreaker. I'm not big into discussing it like I would a movie or book. That being said, my absolute favorite group is Fall Out Boy (I survived the hiatus!). I can listen to anything they put out because I fell in love with Patrick Stump's voice when I was 13 years old, and that is a lifelong and non-negotiable love. All other artists I enjoy are lumped into one big tie for second because picking favorites is hard. If I *had* to describe my taste, I'd tell you that most of my music has some good old electric guitar and vocals I admire. There's some plain old piano, there's some synth-y stuff, there's some straight-up classical...but it's mostly guitar. The most important thing for me is the vocals. I will tell you I don't like a whole lot of rap/hip-hop because the misogyny bothers me. Feel free to alert me to rap artists with better lyrics, I'd love to hear some suggestions!

I guess I'm looking for someone who's patient, intelligent, kind, open-minded, and funny...maybe even a bit broken, because, hey--I am too. I have scars, and I'm no hypocrite.

...Still here? Awesome! Thanks for reading. If you think you'd like to be friends with a possibility of more, just friends, or if you just want a conversation, PM me. I'll be checking in periodically today.

Have a lovely day!

I like money, but I don't worship the almighty dollar. I don't believe in wasting my hard-earned cash on name brand items, I don't like casual sex and haven't done the nasty in almost 3 years. 

My interests include movies of ANY kind (with a fondness for indie flicks and big-budget action/adventure), Cartoons (Adventure Time, Futurama, Ninjago, Simpson's, Bob's Burgers), board games, shows at the Sony Centre, 420, long boring discussions about nothing and EVERYTHING (e.g. is posting pics of your kids online an invasion of privacy? will kids one day sue their parents?), music (R&amp;B, trip hop, ambient/dance, old skool hip-hop), and long drives that lead to the countryside.

My favourite author is Thomas Harris and the last books I read (and loved) are the hunger games trilogy and 'Intimacy' by Hanif Kureishi.

I enjoy being in a relationship, but I'm still having a hard time with monogamy.  I'm just not the jealous type and am really not sure if I'm for or against monogamy. I have a history of being in open relationships and will do my best to talk my partner into being in a 3sum, visiting strip clubs, Or going to a fetish and/or swingers club. I like exploring my sexuality in the context of a relationship.  

I'm looking for:
*new friends who smoke 420, don't take themselves too seriously, and love to explore new restaurants
*a relationship with someone who wants a commitment, but won't try to tie me down or act like he owns me.

The best analogy that an ex gave me is that a relationship with me is like a butterfly. Hold on too tightly and you'll crush and kill it. Allow it to float freely and you'll enjoy the sheer poetry of beauty and freedom. It's the best thing anyone's ever said to me.

I'm a 20 year old History and Politics student trapped on a remote Scottish island and needing to get away as often as possible. 

Like many people in the fine, if often disturbing, realms of reddit I am a nerd. A proper one at that. I like RPGs, PC games, I adore cinema, I read as much as I have time to, I love comic books etc. etc. You know the deal.

I also *adore* restaurants, there is no where - in the public world - that I am happier in than a restaurant. The ambience, the food, the company, the waitresses pretending to be attracted to you for tips. I love it!

My skills include writing, appearing more intelligent than I am, cunnilingus and empathising with people. I may well have more, but if I do I am too lazy to use them.

Here are some quick facts:
- I'm bubbly (in more ways than one)
- I love to drive, though probably not well. I'm asian, a girl AND I have bad vision, so really, my driving skills aren't as good as I think they are.
- I prefer action movies to anything, but period romances are a close second
- Peter Jackson films make me butthurt. Literally. I never thought a movie was too long until I watched Lord of the Rings. I am still contemplating watching The Hobbit or waiting til I can watch it in a more comfortable chair. 
- I like all kinds of music, but I really just listen to bad pop music, it's fun to dance forever alone to.

I am a person of the male persuasion seeking someone of the female persuasion. I am a history and politics student, and I used to work gutting fish [insert crude, female specific BO joke of your own choosing here]. I am a person that tends to exude confidence ironically via his own mechanism for coping with anxiety, which tends to be involve being the centre of any group based activities or gatherings and making lots of jokes. That said then I am more uncomfortable saying what I am good at than it may seem. I'm good at writing, I'm good at empathizing with and understanding people, I am good at several unmentionable things and I am very good at eating pizza.

I am in the UK, but I live in such a remote part of the UK that travel seems less of an issue so I am not too bothered if any potential messages are further afield.

I love books, films, TV, fluffy bath mats, unicorns, black unicorns, feet and oddly shaped female noses. Oh and PC games of course.

Looking for someone to debate the great questions in life such as, do black unicorns have larger horns than their white counterparts? Are there Asian unicorns? Why do hippos make a strange mewing sound when they make love?

I am also looking for someone who likes cuddles, I like cuddles you see. Cuddles, unicorns and pizza.

* Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker.
* Ass, gas, or grass; no one rides for free.

Alright, so there admittedly probably more than that but those are the two right off the top of my head. I'm a fun-loving 27-year-old who is down with just about any setting. I love being outside, talking long walks, soaking up the sun, and just enjoying nice weather - but I also enjoy cuddling up in bed with a good book/movie. 

I enjoy all kinds of music, but my tastes lean toward '80s nostalgia, classic rock, and the gothtacular. I've been listening to a lot of Depeche Mode and The Sisters of Mercy recently. (If you see someone in black clothes and heavy eyeliner in Kansas, it might just be me - not many of us around here.)

Currently I work at a deli/catering service. I really enjoy the work, but the co-workers and customers are crap. I'd love to do some professional writing but I've just bowed out of a year and a half long gig as a fancypants featured writer for an online magazine and now I'm taking the time to write for myself - when I'm not pursing one of my other interests, like baking, crafty things, reading, gaming (I'm a huge D&amp;D nerd and I wish I could find a group around here, but I also love vidya games), exercise (if it's something fun, it's not like exercise at all!), and infusing vodka with candy. If you haven't guessed by now, I kind of like to drink a little. Sorry.

Here's the catch: I am not a small woman. However! I have lost 95 pounds, and am definitely on my way to being a smaller woman. But not too much smaller. I like my curves.

Other random shit I like: Firefly/Serenity, The Walking Dead, Justified, Twin Peaks, Being Human (U.S. &amp; UK both), Lost Girl, Family Guy, American Dad, horror movies, cyberpunk, survival horror/psychological horror, short stories, The Silence of the Lambs...

I'm looking for a chat buddy, but be forewarned: I take things at my own speed, and I'm a little shy. But I think I'm pretty kick ass.

This is attempt #2 at this!

**Ok, terrible jokes aside, I guess I should tell you a little about me:**

I am 25 years old, 182 lbs as of yesterday, 5'9 and 1/2, auburn hair, brown/green eyes, and Irish looking.  (I have a picture and will send it to you if you are interested =D)

My main hobby, like many of you here, is gaming!  Recently I have been playing a lot of Starcraft 2, Team Fortress 2, and Tera.  I will be picking up Diablo 3 when it comes out to burn time until Guild Wars 2 launches.  I have a PS3 that I often times neglect but just got Journey on it.  I also have a DS3D and have been playing Pokemon on it :)

My other hobbies include snowboarding in the winter, traveling when I can, listening to random podcasts (history of Japan is pretty sweet one), and watching professional SC2.

I have just recently (past year or so) really started to get myself in shape.  I lead a physically healthy lifestyle and have actually started to enjoy running.

**What I am looking for:**

A girlfriend nerd!  The most important part of a relationship, I feel, is that you never get tired being around each other.  Having things to do together makes for a very good relationship.  I would want to play games together, go on a run or walk together, travel around and see parts of the world together.

For physical qualities, I pefer skinny over curvey, shorter over taller, and white (pale?) over tan.  That last one is a little weird but I figured I would throw it in there.  While personality is much more important to me...I feel that couples should also be physically attracted to each other!

**Other Information I Deemed Relevant**

I am more than willing to start out with a Long Distance Relationship.  I currenly live in the North West portion of the States, but will be moving in roughly a year or so.

I have a degree in Computer Networking and have started on my Masters.  I work for the government (Air Force Officer) and have really enjoyed the ride so far.  I have my life in a great place right now and would really like to find a girl to share it with.

I hope to hear back from you!  Yes you, reading this line right now.  If you made it this far then you should hit the message button and send me a PM :)

1336240057.0,10,self.ForeverAloneDating,t8khn,M4F - Rotund English dullard in need of a hat. Anyone willing to be a surrogate for style?,11,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/t8khn/m4f_rotund_english_dullard_in_need_of_a_hat/,"Get ahead, get a hat. That's what they say... and by they, I of course mean horrendously outdated 1950s advertisers making a push to get everyone to buy their product. So if I were the slightest bit more suggestible in a westerly direction, I'd probably now be asking people for vodka or a new Nissan. But no, today, it's a hat.

I used to have many many hats. Docker hats, sleek brimmed hats, woolly hats, a bespoke fishy hat and even some ghastly patchwork Wizadora-looking fruitbowl hats (more than one in fact... apparently I was so abhorred by the first one at a car boot that I had to snatch it away from delicate eyes and I could only buy another one when I saw it... A sacrifice, for sure. You're welcome)... but now I am distinctly hatless and since having a pretty dramatic haircut (the loss of most of the length of my hair was dramatic, I didn't go to some clifftop barbershop during a storm or anything... Note to business self: Set up clifftop thunderbarber), I find myself needing some other bonce#-ward accoutrement.

Now sure, I could just drop by a Top Shop or whatever and pick out an ever-so-un-swish Fedora with pinstripe and some obscene print on it... but everyone already does that. Conversely, a jester's bonnet would strike out onto the clichéd ""I'm an original, me! Just like the other weirdos."" path... They're not particularly practical for everyday usage. Also, I've never been snowboarding and I have a gigantic head, so a tea-cosy isn't particularly well advised either.

Why so demanding, me?

Of course, there's always the other end of the scale and finish the botch-hair-job I started and instead of buying a hat, I buy some clippers and see what's underneath the remnants of mop atop my noggin. Then I'd just be somewhere 3 months from now crying about my burned scalp and in need of a hat all the same. There's no getting around it, destiny is pointing me at headwear.

So just seeing if anyone fancies a shopping trip or something for an afternoon. You know, cause that'd obviously not be really awkward. But I do really want a hat... and you never know, you might also get a hat... or some sunglasses... or an ice cream... or an umbrella. The only limits are your imagination! (and the shops... and your money... we are unlikely to come away with a Lambo, for example)

Maybe you DON'T want to help a guy find a hat (you monster), but you DO want someone to hang out with. That'd be grand too, but I am pretty boring. I probably won't join you in skydiving, bungee-jumping, hang-gliding, kickboxing or underground Russian gambling... Conversely, I would absolutely posse up for some ominous glaring at people who you feel have wronged you, I would totally help you put various ribbons on lamp posts to brighten up our city centres and I would give great consideration to monetising the realm of piggy-backs... So yeah.

Hello, by the way. :)

since i can relate to the social anxiety alot of people here on FA are experiencing i thought why not take a shot at getting into contact. 

I am aware that the chances of anyone finding the love of their lifes here are pretty slim so i am not expecting anything serious. A pressureless conversation with a like minded individual though would be a fresh breath of air.

First a bit about myself.
My current, daily basis interests include:

**-Animes and Mangas** (*i rather like the classics like Berserk, Cowboy Bebop, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou etc.*)

**-Video Games** (*mainly story driven or creative ones*)


**-Books** (*i haven't read a whole lot which i would like to change*)

**-Onthology and science**


I am studying geology right now and consider myself an atheist. My actual opinion about religion is a bit more complex though, i feel inclined to some concepts of budhism and philosophies of ghandi for example.

Even though what i have written about me until know seems like the standart FA loner/nerd which i undoubtedly **am** it is not exactly the person i **want** to be. I have a deep desire for doing the unconventional, breaking loose from societys daily routine. This i think is mainly rooted in my love and admiration for the majesty and beauty of nature. I know this sounds swollen and stuff but i would really rather like to trek through a real forest for day's than playing a game in which i run through a simulated one. I want to do sports, not in order to look better or have muscles but rather to know what it feels like to run a marathon or climb a mountain with my real hands and real feet and feel the sweat cover my body as i deeply statisfied fall to the ground in order to rest from the exhaustion i overcame myself rather than merely imagining it. I mean i only have one life and only 3/4 left of it so i should better get my ass up now.

I had these fantasies for quite some time but usually the daily routine of playing games and surfing on the net which i am so used to comes back at me. But now that i have some free time and an (hopefully) iron will i plan to seriously try and change myself slowly into a me that enyojs actual living more.

Another part i wouldn't mind changed about me are my social insecurities of course (otherwise i wouldn't be posting on FA). I have kind of come to terms with them to a certain degree and think that don't minding solitude is in a way part of who i am but i would really appreciate to share my thoughts and all with more close friends and possibly someone i love. If i'd never find it so be it no use crying over spilled milk but i have a feeling that getting closer to who i want to be gets me closer to finding that as well.

Well, that's the gist of me but i am mainly posting here to contact people. Precicely speaking i would like to have casual honest conversations, maybe chat friendships with a fellow shy/social unsecure person, perferably from the opposite sex, in order to learn a little more about how you come to and deal with those problems and how women think in general because i never really had much female friendships this would be an oppurtunity for me to learn more about talking to girls and other people in general. I just think that two people thinking of themselves to belong into the category of being ""Forever Alone"" could help each other more effeciently than one could do so *alone*.

Don't try to give ourselves reasons to back out, that's why we are forever alone. Don't convince yourself ""he won't like me and I'll feel like I wasted a night"" so what? Unless you tell me you like to drown your neighbors puppies because he listens to bad music, it's very unlikely I'm going to hate you. Going out for dinner is fun. Meet someone new and expand your horizons. The only request I will make will be verification that we are real people first before we meet.

Forever alone may be a bit of a misnomer. I have lot's of friends, but I've gotten a bit bored of most of them. They always seem to want something and few of them are very interesting. I'm into pretty much everything and going on adventures. 

I'm looking for someone who likes to be a girl. Someone who likes to wear skirts and dresses and look nice. Someone who likes to get flowers. Someone who likes to go to plays and chick flicks. I love theater and a good romantic comedy is a guilty pleasure of mine. I want someone who want's to cuddle by the fireplace with a cup of hot chocolate. I want someone who will dance with me when we go to clubs.

I'd prefer someone with a nerdy side though. This is becoming increasingly common, but I'm still surprised at how people call themselves nerds just because they have an ipad or play a video game or two. I'm into science, I'm into literature, I'm into scifis, anime, and DnD to name a few. I don't game much anymore, although I've recently gotten into League of Legends.

I love movies and TV and have probably watched way more than my fair share of both.

I am more than 420 friendly and have probably the most bad ass setup you'd ever see. I'm kind of cutting back for now and debating quitting, so this isn't much of a requirement or anything. It would be pretty cool to find someone who would want to smoke and then chill out in the hot tub and read or discuss ""philosophy"".

I want someone who appreciates fine dining. I'm a bit of a food snob myself. I love adventurous eating, but I could eat good Japanese food every day for the rest of my life and be completely content.

I like going to raves, but not all the time. Think around 2-3 massives and about 3-5 small or underground raves a year.

I'm 6'2"" and 200lbs. Dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. I like to keep relatively active. I love to go on casual bike rides. I'm more than happy to trade pics.

Now for the long term stuff. I live in Irvine right now, but I am moving to LA in January. I am very Dominant and I like to get pretty kinky. I'd prefer someone who likes to get kinky too. I don't care if you have any experience or not, I just would rather someone who is open to the idea, or even better someone who has fantasized about it.

A bit about me: I'll be 20 in ~1 month, I'm from Canada, I'm living in a dorm (because of school), when I was writing this, I was streaming Game 6 (Boston vs Chicago, because I don't have a TV), I'm supposed to be studying for a statics (not statistics) midterm, and I love drinking water.

I'm not a huge movie/TV person, but I'm okay watching almost anything. I don't really have any preferences. SHOOT. TOEWS SCORED (while I was writing this). Oh, right! I like playing most sports. I used to play soccer competitively, but ever since my knee started acting funny (about 3 years ago), I've stopped and now I just play for fun. Video games.. I don't really play video games anymore. Probably because I didn't bring a console with me, which is probably because I don't have a TV here. Why not PC? Because none of my friends play MapleStory anymore. Just kidding, I play VN's, if that counts.

Things that'll make you lose your interest: I have never consumer alcohol, ever (unless you count rum cake). I'm not the outdoorsy-hiking kinda person, because I'm afraid of spiders and most insects.

Guess what, I like you, yep you, you are awesome, and basically fantastic! hurry up and message me already!! I am super lonely because my job requires me to be a FOB hopper, which means I go from tiny base to tiny base never staying in one spot for more than five days! It makes it impossible to have any meaningful relationships which I would like to fix!

Cliff notes on me:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am a world traveler, currently underworld traveling. I love variety, New foods, new people, colors, strangeness, scenery which is weird to say because I am an amateur sculptor and all my art is kind of bland as hell.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In my spare time I love hiking and getting out into nature especially if its with good friends, good food, and some dogs, don't I &lt;3 cats too :P I play basketball and I like exploring just about anything. If you have an awesome hobby I bet I would like it. (excluding underwater basket-weaving.) I love books, old and new, If you like ancient history I am your guy, Neil Gainman is a good friend my favorite author. I love movies too and video games.

&gt;&gt;My favorite color is Turqoise. my favorite animal is a Mongolian duck. lets see other important things.....I feel like I am forgetting something, OH I am Libral libratarian. (Is it weird that I thought of colors and animals before politics?)

&gt;I do IT stuff that often resembles manual labor, my degree is still a crime in progress. I have ambitions and goals and all those other life fiddly bits like you have but we can get to those later.

What are your cliff notes??

Hello, and Now a bit about myself. Biology, physics, chemistry, these are some of the things I am the most interested in, but I dabble in everything else, history, art, literature, psychology, philosophy, et cetera. Humans are generalists and I follow suit. For a list of movies, music, games and other things I like, who doesn't love itemized lists? I know I do.

* Movies – Repo! The Genetic Opera, The Shawshank Redemption, Zombieland, all the Monty Python movies, A Clockwork Orange, This is Spinal Tap, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, anything on Netflix, etc. 
* Shows – NOVA, Terra Nova, World War II marathons on The History Channel,  Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead. Anything except reality TV and game shows, really. Netflix applies to this section as well.
* Games – Electronic and otherwise. I recently finished Tomb Raider and I am currently spending my time playing Minecraft and Tera. I'm also working my way through the most recent humble bundle and loving Super Hexagon and Solar 2. I also like tabletop games, but the times I get to play them are few and far between. 
* Music – I am a big fan of Classic Rock. The Beetles, The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Kinks, etc. Classical would be my second favorite. I am particularly fond of powerful piano pieces. After those two everything evens out. I like pretty much everything and will give anything a shot. I believe I mentioned I was a generalist before. 

Currently I'm still and undergraduate and I'm looking at graduate school. I think what I would like to do would be to teach at some level, eventually, though I can see myself being happy working in a lab. I don't have much free time for most of the week, but in my free time I can be found with my nose in a book, playing a game, watching the newest episode of Archer with a friend, or if it is the weekend, maybe out hiking on the hills and mountains around where I live. I prefer small groups of close friends over things with lots of people, so it is very seldom that I will go out to a bar or something. I also love to ponder. How and why are the most exciting things to think about for most things. Who, what, where and when are also fun, though less exciting. 

I guess what I'm seeking is to meet new people and make new friends. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. I'm more than 50 miles from the closest Wal Mart if that is any indication. That is what makes the internet so great. I've met people from every continent. Except Antarctica. If you have ever spent time in Antarctica then I definitely want to talk to you. 

Hmm. This seems to long, but perhaps that is better than being too short. Oh well, there it is!",,False,,t5_2sdpe,False,,,True,t3_1aqhwy,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1aqhwy/22_m4f_anywhere_awkward_biology_student_seeks/,

So I’m really just here to make new friends first and foremost- of either gender, if any women are reading and feel up for new friends.  

STUFF ABOUT **ME**: Grew up in a little town in Nebraska and currently attend college in a slightly larger small town in South Dakota. Meeting someone nearby would be nice, but since I’m in an area with more cattle than humans I’m willing to befriend people from anywhere.   

- Disclaimer: I’m not a gamer so if you’re looking for an Xbox Live partner or something like that it’s just not going to happen. Nothing against gamers, but other than Sims I’m pretty clueless.  

- Alternative disclaimer: I don’t smoke anything and I don’t drink. Not opposed to talking to someone that smokes or drinks occasionally, just pointing out that it’s not what I’m into.   

SOME THINGS I LIKE: Doctor Who, Harry Potter, Firefly, cake, cats, reading (a lot of fantasy genre), music written about books,  chocolate, origami, short quotations about life, novelists who draw on their faces with Sharpies, the internet...   

Physically, if you want to know, I’m 5’5” and very pale with brownish/reddish hair. Not as skinny as I could be, but not in the obese range. Kinda average on the looks scale, not winning any beauty contests.  
I don't like the fact that looks matter, but I know that they do so I'll provide an undoctored picture of me if you provide one of you.  

**YOU** SHOULD BE… (yes, you, reading this)  

- Not be a dick. (Ambiguous statements FTW)  
- Willing to speak about things other than reddit memes.  
- Someone who has passable spelling/grammar. I try not to be a Grammar Nazi but… if you typ like dis I wil judge u 4 it srry.  
- Able to PM/comment in slightly more personalized terms than just “you seem cool let’s talk” because while I’m sure the person behind that statement is very nice, it isn’t good incentive for me to reply if that’s all the effort you’re willing to put into it. Tell me something about you, ask about the stuff I didn’t mention, tell me a cheesy joke, ask me if I think Snape deserves the title of hero- don’t just feed me a generic line that could apply to every other person in the world.

- Not against ""friendzoning""  


I’m socially awkward and shy offline (hence the FADating) but much less so online so feel free to comment or PM me if you’d like. Don’t be shy about it, that’s why I posted.

Sometimes I give good advice! [Sometimes...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8l0YM5Y9lA)

Anyways, a bit about myself. I'm a nerdy guy! I'm into all kinds of games, from board games (both the classic kinds and the EuroGaming, Fantasy Flight Games kind), to card games (I love Texas Hold'Em), to pen-and-paper games (I've played DnD 3rd and 4th, Changling: The Lost, Warhammer RPG, and Legend of the Five Rings RPG, and I wouldn't mind finding a group!), and, of course, video games! I play a lot of games on Steam and I'm a big League of Legends player! I like FPSs, strategy and simulation games, RPGS, and a number of unusual games. Aside from gaming, I love to go to the movies and eat out, especially at new places. I love all kinds of food and sometimes I subject my family to my cooking experiments! Aside from gaming, I love to roleplay on the internets and I do some amateur short story writing in fantasy and horror genres. I'm hoping to get some of my work published. I have a strong interest in reading horror short stories and pretty much anything in the horror and gothic genres. One of my favorite game series is the Silent Hill series. I also have an avid interest in pets and some amateur gardening, including carnivorous plants. I have a mild interest in anime, mostly in reading some niche manga, especially romantic ones. I do have a pervy bent and I enjoy some good hentai. I know what I like and while I'm understanding of others, I'm not afraid to speak my mind or ask direct questions. I feel the best and freest when I'm allowed to said whatever I wish. But at heart I'm a compassionate person, so I'm not given to speaking rudely or unkindly. I like to joke a lot as well ^ ^

I am working as a library assistant at UTSA and I love my job! I have a BA in History and a BA in English and I hope to continue going to college soon. I have many things I hope to engage in when I save up a good nest egg, including martial arts. I'm keenly interested in Krav Maga and Jeet Kune Do. I, regretfully, still live with my folks since I graduated late from college, but I'm saving up to strike out on my own.

What am I looking for? Anything and everything. A friend, a lover, a girlfriend, and anything in between. I'm open to just chatting, on AIM, YIM, MSN, or Skype, or just trading messages on Reddit.

When out of school, I'm pretty well known as the relaxer in my social circle. Sure, I go out but deep down, I love watching a good movie or a new T.V show. Sometimes the best times are the relaxing ones, and being able to spend some of that time with someone would be a pretty big bonus.

My name is...well, it's not actually Lee, but that's what I'm going to go by. I'm an 18 year old who recently went through a break up that was on the crazy spectrum and lost a lot of friends in the process. So now, I'm not going to lie, I'm looking for validation and friends in general.

This is only the second time I've done something like this, and the first time I did it, I got a little overwhelmed. I got approximately 8k PMs from guys who gave me nothing more than their kik name, and then expected me to drag them through a conversation, apparently until I felt like sending them a picture of my tits? I dunno. Honestly, the whole situation made me uncomfortable. I'm looking for someone to talk to, to vent to, to be vented at by (lol that's an awkward phrase), to discuss lives of hopes and dreams and what not.

Some things I LOVE and would love to talk about: Supernatural, Harry Potter (I'm going to LeakyCon 2013!!!), theatre, Disney (this is a BIG one), Lost, finger nail polish, The Office, Game of Thrones...I'm into a lot of serial TV and what not. I'll be happy to listen to your stuff if you listen to my stuff. What it comes down to is I just want someone to talk to who doesn't make my skin crawl, make me lead the conversation and who I have at least a little something in common with.

And I'll be honest: I don't expect to ever decide to ""date"" someone without ever meeting them, and I don't expect to be comfortable meeting someone in RL that I met this way...but you might be able to change my mind. Anyway, I'm sorry if I'm coming off mean, I just want to make sure I get to talk to some people that I might get along with!

I have been a Reddit lurker for years and it's a real testament to my foreveralone-ness that my very first post should be a self ad. 

A little about myself and then I'll mention what I'm looking for.

I'm a very athletic, confident and fit nerd. I'm a small business owner and a part time bartender. Most of the people that I interact with on a daily basis assume that I'm a womanizer, a jock, or a big party animal. None of those are true. I have learned to fit in with the ""normals,"" but in fact I'm a total nerd. I play computer or board games, browse imgur,  read fantasy novels, or watch various shows like Dexter for the majority of my free time. However, as mentioned above, I'm also very athletic. I like to be active and outdoorsy. I rock climb, bike, swim, run, practice MMA and more, several times a week. 

I'm looking for a girl who shares my interests in both worlds, fantasy and reality - I can not separate the two. Of course, finding a date is a long shot; I'm on here because I'd love to chat with someone. It's 4am and I am not ready to sleep yet! Is anyone out here ;D 

Random factoids: I ride a motorcycle, go either Lindy hopping or board gaming on Wednesday nights, have a white German Shepherd, play too much League of Legends, graduated with a BS in Biology and I'm not using it, was born in Bulgaria, eggs are my comfort food, sleep with socks on, am a terribly spontaneous shopper, I'm exactly six foot tall.  

In case this matters, here are a few photos of me:

i have yet to meet anyone in my life that i can completely relate to. while i'm a social, optimistic person, i have never been able to really connect to a guy. it's disheartening, but i never lose hope!

a little bit about me:

i'm 5'3, &amp; live in central florida. i really enjoy going to little hipster bars with my friends, &amp; my favorite beer in the world is guinness [although strongbow cider has a dear place in my heart]. my favorite show is adventure time, &amp; i can outquote you any day of the week. i don't really play video games, but an ideal lazy day for me would be sitting on the couch with a boyfriend, him playing video games &amp; me browsing reddit. there's something about comfortable silence that makes me feel good.

my music taste is relatively broad, but some of my favorite bands are  two door cinema club, said the whale, san cisco, passion pit, phoenix, mumford &amp; sons, say anything, &amp; neon indian.

i play piano &amp; have a really old moog that i pretend i'm good at using. i've also been vocally trained since i was seven, so there are a few shitty covers of songs sitting around on my macbook that will never see the light of day.

&amp; my biggest guilty pleasure is cosplaying. my roommates all make fun of me when a new wig comes in the mail &amp; i freak out, but i love making costumes &amp; going to conventions &amp; meeting people who are slightly off. it's so fun &amp; worth all of the ridicule from my friends.

i'm open to a lot, but my ideal male is tall, wears skinny jeans, has tattoos, &amp; elegantly disheveled hair. this is negotiable, though. i just really dig the hipster look.

this is getting too long. if you like anything you read, feel free to pm me. or don't. you could just let me cry in my room &amp; masturbate with my tears. the choice is yours.

ps, location doesn't matter. i usually love talking to brits, because the wit &amp; humor most british guys possess is exactly how i am. but once again, i don't mind where you are as long as you'd like to have a conversation.

have a great night, FAs. :]

Sometimes I give good advice! [Sometimes...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8l0YM5Y9lA)

Anyways, a bit about myself. I'm a nerdy guy! I'm into all kinds of games, from board games (both the classic kinds and the EuroGaming, Fantasy Flight Games kind), to card games (I love Texas Hold'Em), to pen-and-paper games (I've play DnD 3rd and 4th, Changling: The Lost, Warhammer RPG, and Legend of the Five Rings RPG, and I wouldn't mind finding a group!), and, of course, video games! I play a lot of games on Steam and I'm a big League of Legends player! I like FPSs, strategy and simulation games, RPGS, and a number of unusual games. Aside from gaming, I love to go to the movies and eat out, especially at new places. I love all kinds of food and sometimes I subject my family to my cooking experiments! Aside from gaming, I love to roleplay on the internets and I do some amateur short story writing in fantasy and horror genres. I'm hoping to get some of my work published. I have a strong interest in reading horror short stories and pretty much anything in the horror and gothic genres. One of my favorite game series is the Silent Hill series. I also have an avid interest in pets and some amateur gardening, including carnivorous plants. I have a mild interest in anime, mostly in reading some niche manga, especially romantic ones. I do have a pervy bent and I enjoy some good hentai. I know what I like and while I'm understanding of others, I'm not afraid to speak my mind or ask direct questions. I feel the best and freest when I'm allowed to said whatever I wish. But at heart I'm a compassionate person, so I'm not given to speaking rudely or unkindly. I like to joke a lot as well ^ ^

I am working as a substitute teacher, but I am actively looking for more stable, full-time work. I have a BA in History and a BA in English and I hope to continue going to college when I get a full time job. I have many things I hope to engage in when I get a more secure means of income and a better vehicle, including martial arts. I'm keenly interested in Krav Maga and Jeet Kune Do. I, regretfully, still live with my folks since I graduated late from college, but I'm hoping to land a job soon that will change that.

What am I looking for? Anything and everything. A friend, a lover, a girlfriend, and anything in between. I'm open to just chatting, on AIM, YIM, MSN, or Skype, or just trading messages on Reddit. I'm open to looking for some good friends to hang out with, but I don't drink or get high. I'm not really interested in the bar or club scene. I'm always looking for new friends and good times. In the end, I hope to find someone special to game with and be sexy with.

I've posted before looking for mentors, I'm here now to introduce a workshop we'll be running in May and to invite you to take part in it. I hope that's okay.

The idea is that for the month of May we spend 30 minutes each day working on an aspect of our relationships. It might be that you want to start a relationship or to become better at the one you're already in. The goal you choose is entirely up to you. All you need do is commit to working on it for 30 minutes a day, and to checking in at least once weekly to let the rest of the group know how you're getting on.

You might think that there's not much you can achieve with only 30 minutes effort but I assure you, the results can be significant. It doesn't take much regular, focused effort to make a difference, but if you feel particularly stuck the proof that change is happening can be just the kick you need to get you going. There's also something very empowering about making a commitment to yourself and to others. And then delivering on it. 

Workshop is actually a bit of a grand name because no-one will be leading it. As the name of our subreddit suggests, we're into group help - specifically peer help. We'll set our goals together, will answer each other's questions and cheer each other on. There's no practical limit on the number of people who can take part, in fact the more of us there are the greater the group dynamic will be. 

So if you do feel stuck, if you do want to supercharge your relationship efforts and take a large step forward [come join us](/r/group_help_dating). ",,False,,t5_2sdpe,False,,,True,t3_so6ny,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/so6ny/xpost_from_dating_advice_31_day_reddit/,

I wouldn't necessarily classify myself as being forever alone.  I'm just sort of tired of posting in r4r.  It's time for a change of pace, change of scenery.

Anyway, I'm 19, in SF.  Currently studying nursing.  I hate to say it, but I'm quite the busy bee, but if I find you interesting enough, I will certainly make time for you.  I love to read.  I don't really have any favorites because I read so much, but I recently finished Murakami's Norwegian Wood and am currently reading Hawking's A Brief History of Time.  I'm probably going to purchase this book called The Rest is Noise.  It's about classical music and how it's similar to what's playing on the radio nowadays.  

Aside from books, I enjoy sewing.  My favorite shows would have to be Parks and Recreation and Mad Men.  I enjoy eating lots of things like bean burritos from Taco Bell and orange marmalade on an english muffin.  Oh, did I mention that I'm a compulsive tea drinker?

Physically, I'm just a small Asian girl.  I have dark brown hair and dark brown eyes.  I'm usually wearing a cute dress and a pair of Weejuns.  Sometimes, I wear glasses, sometimes I don't.  Depends if I go out for a run that day. 

What I'm looking for?  I dunno.  I guess, someone to have fun with.  Someone who enjoy reading just as much or maybe more than I do.  Someone to have a semi-serious relationship with.  You don't have to necessarily be in California to message me, but I can only go so far with email and skype.  

What do I like?  To be honest, and maybe all of you are going to hate me for this, but I'm mostly attracted to tall white males.  (Small, unnoticeable edit: I knew I'd get crap for stating this ahead of time.)  If you're awkward and sort of apathetic towards the world around you, I'll probably be even more attracted to you.  Don't let what I just stated keep you from messaging me.  I will send pictures upon request, and I certainly hope you attach some if you decide to message me.  (Other unnoticeable edit: I just simply stated that I'm attracted to a certain type.  As in I'm more inclined to get into bed with that sort of person, not that I idolize them in any sense.  I think it's fair to say that we all have preferences.

What I'm looking for in terms of dating: Generally positive, intelligent, geeky, nerdy, on the socially awkward side maybe, who is looking for someone to lavish attention on and be given absolute hoards of attention and affection in turn.  I really really like genuinely nice men.  

Guess I should add - Local people around 28 ish - 39 ish preferred.

I'm pretty geeky. I play a lot of video games, and watch Star Wars regularly. (Although, this is reddit. You've probably assumed that already.)

This subreddit seems to have tons of Canadians, so here it goes...

I think that telling a girl you have low self esteem right off the bat is usually a terrible dating strategy but I'm hoping this is a place where I can find someone who empathizes. I can be very shy, bad at making small talk, and I get depressed from loneliness, but I am also super kind, independent, and open minded. I don't like to be pressured and I am very cognizant of not pressuring others. I'm not perfect but I have a lot to offer someone else who might be lonely. 

I like to go for walks, watch movies/TV, debate philosophy, read, and play video games or board games. I love to try new places to eat and I am a vegetarian. I don't have much spare time recently because I work both a full time and part time job. The weather has been so fantastic this week I have been wishing I had someone's hand to hold while I walk.

I don't like to party or go to bars unless it is a very small gathering. I rarely drink although I do smoke weed. I dream of a relationship where my partner really enjoys just spending the night inside together.

My end goal here is to find a relationship. It would be great to get to know someone over a few messages then meet up if we click. If anyone happens to live downtown we could even go for a walk.

I am going to be honest. So first, let me put the ""negatives"" about me. Also, the basics! 18f. Los Angeles, CA. 5'5"". 

---
I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder

I have crazy mood swings

I love a lot of people and tend to be expressive when I do

I sort of have multiple personalities (not in a disorder way, just in a... me way)

I like attention 

I've attempted suicide before

I am not conventionally attractive [Pictures of me are on my post history. Remember to look at my post history, so that you can add to this list. My comments are incriminating, as well.]

I'm kind of weird emotionally

Abandonment issues

I'm bad at talking to people


Haven't left yet? Good! I've been thinking about posting here for a while, because I wasn't sure what sort of replies I would get, if any. Now, more about me and what I would like! (As for my positive sides, I'm kind of hoping some might be evident because as much as I love myself, I save some of my narcissism for AFTER people get to know me.) I love people. I love cuddling. I love looking at people, because people are beautiful aesthetically. I love watching movies with people, and anime, and TV shows too and playing games. (My PC access is nonexistent right now, so I have to use my Mac for games. It is sad. I still have League of Legends, though.) I like trying new things, so yes, I would be open to learning about YOUR interests as well! I like listening to music with people, too. I also like going on adventures/ walking around with people and that sort of thing. I also just like just...being around another person and having that openness where you can be yourself and not be judged and know everything about a person and accept them. I also miss the warm comfort of love, even more than the silly butterflies of the early relationship. Yes, I've had a relationship before. I also love emotional people. Anyways...

Wow, you're still interested? I love you already! Hahaha. You might not end up wanting a relationship from me, but I'm at this point in my life where I just want to try new things and I might make a friend out of this, at the very least.

Oh right, where I am in my life. I am currently set for a community college, but honestly, I have no idea what I am doing with my life. I just know that I like helping people, people in general, making the world a better place, animals, art, creating things.... what I am good at? I do not know. 

I make myself sound terrible. Well, if you've always wanted a girlfriend despite the extreme foreveraloneness reeking out of this post, I might be your girl. I wonder if this will get anywhere near as many responses as makenewfriendshere/needafriend/r4r posts because if so... I take ages to reply. I get overwhelmed by lots of replies, but this one was a descriptive post and so I expect 0 replies! I am going to crawl into a hole, so if you DO find something you like here, I will check out responses in a few hours. 

***
A friend told me to add what I am looking for...
Gender doesn't matter.
You should be a cute person. I mean cute not as in ""physically cute"" but you must be cute and silly sometimes.
Honesty is nice. Tell me what you want from me, for example. Friendship is totally okay.
Not looking for casual sex partners. I did not mention sex at all in the above post until right now, so there was a hint.
Ummm...

EDIT: So, I got way more responses than I expected. I had a nice day today and came home to loads in my inbox. I'll try to get to them all, haha. Please be patient. You're all interesting and lovely people.

Cool grass beneath my feet, a silly joke, a good book, the ocean, etc.  I try to live my life appreciating what I have and believe that open-mindedness is one of the most important qualities that a person can have.  I think there's nothing like live music and that Batman is the best fictional character ever.  I love engrossing TV shows that don't treat the viewer like they're dumber than a sack of potatoes.  Mad Men, Arrested Development, Game of Thrones, and Breaking Bad are amongst my favorites.  And speaking of shows, I will always have a part of me that is a kid at heart.

1366341379.0,9,self.ForeverAloneDating,1cnmat,[M4F]29 Let's beat depression (and social anxiety) together!,9,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1cnmat/m4f29_lets_beat_depression_and_social_anxiety/,"Hi! Let's begin with a the short version of a long story:


When I was around 17 I suddenly lost interest in everything and quit high school. I basically lived in my parent's house doing nothing for a couple years until I was offered a job. I worked for a couple more years, then decided to leave the country for awhile for a random reason. I came back in 2008 and then went back to my old job and pretty much old life, up until a few months ago. All during this time I basically isolated myself and had a difficult time just surviving every day. 
 
Due to an event that would have traumatized anyone, I fell down into the abyss. I had lost the will to live and seriously considered killing myself. Realizing this probably wasn't good, I called a behavioral health center and made an appointment. They informed me that I had major depressive disorder, and based on my history it probably started way back in high school. Since nobody including myself ever really thought of seeking treatment (my parent's thought I was just mellow and I thought adult life was just really hard).


Fast forward to today. I'm on medication that has had a profound effect on me. I want to get better. I want to have a life where I look forward to the future. Though my mood and general outlook have improved considerably, I found that (apparently) if you isolate yourself for most of your adult life you don't develop very good social skills (totally not obvious right?). This is problematic since the one objective reason for my depression is my lack of meaningful contact with women (never had a girlfriend blah blah you guys probably get it). I have tried to get something started a couple times, but I'm an honest person and it always gets out that I was emotionally dead for over a decade and have no social skills and still don't enjoy most activities and generally act odd and blah blah blah negative self deprecation rearing its ugly head as usual. 

Anyway, I came up with the genius idea that if I found a girl/woman/female (what is the most respectful term?) with the similar issues, I might be able to connect with them better, and even maybe we could help each other. Okay I know you're thinking ""Everybody has that same idea it isn't original and &lt;insert possibility of success&gt;"". Giving up before I try something was the old me. Now even though I'll probably fail (yay negative thinking), at least I'm moving forward (sort of). It doesn't even really have to be a romantic relationship (although that'd be nice). Best thing is, because I once wanted to kill myself and have lived a life of constant emotional pain, I don't get upset very easily (I get truly angry maybe once every other year). So as long as you keep talking, no matter what you say, there is almost NO way you can A) Weird me out, B) Offend me, C)Make me judge you. So if you're looking for the person who might be immune to whatever reasons you think nobody will ever accept you for, try me out! 

Now I do have to include a disclaimer that I am still technically depressed, so when my medication isn't effecting me (it occasionally doesn't work for some reason) I might not be as chipper as I am now (so I might start talking about nothing but negative things and think everything is hopeless and nobody will accept me anyway blah blah depressed blah).

Shoot me a message! Operators are standing by! (Well at least one of them :D)

I've done this twice before actually and I met a lot of really cool people into lots of different things so I thought it would be cool to do this again and meet some new people. I'm currently a somewhat overachieving college student studying sociology and psychology, mostly with an emphasis on public and governmental housing in poor urban areas especially around my hometown of Chicago. 

I'm awful at getting out these days, but when I do it's usually to go out and get a coffee with my best friend or try new restaurants, get drinks with my friends and finally to go to the beach and be one of those obnoxious people who take electronics to the beach and ignore the beauty (yelling kids and loud music) around them. I'm also horrible at being incredibly serious I'm a laugher which can be annoying but whatever we all have our quirks. 

I'm a huge sports fan, there was a time in my life where I spent the majority of my day watching ESPN, thankfully I've graduated to other channels since then but I am still kind of sport obsessed thanks to my family. I'm a big football (soccer) fan and I'm a Portuguese football know it all who obsessively supports her team and sometimes goes off the deep end. Every year I go to see Real Madrid at UCLA, the highlight of my football loving life was meeting Zinedine Zidane, bro is cool. 

I'm not just some crazy soccer watching chick but I've also been raised a Chicago Bulls fan and a Chicago Bears fan (though I wouldn't say I take NFL football as seriously since I only pay attention to it when I'm playing fantasy football against my mother, my brother and her co-workers so I can talk crap for a year). I also watch some tennis and golf.

I play video games but only ones where I can shoot someone or run someone over. I'm not so much into newer games, I'm more N64/Game Cube/Super Nintendo or Playstation 2 centered though I do now have an XBox 360 that I will eventually buy games for and use to play games and not just stream netflix and watch other people play video games on youtube.

Speaking of youtube my favorite thing to do is watch Nova over on youtube play happy wheels because why the hell not?

I'm new-ish to Vegas, so I don't know a lot of people. I live with my two best friends, so I'm not always alone, but I sleep through most of the morning and spending time with the same two people every evening before work is wearing on my sanity.

Check me out~",10,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/19yxww/24_m4f_bay_area_ca_the_title_may_be_nothing/,"I honestly think one of the most difficult things to do is start a post 'advertising' yourself. How do I convince all of you that I'm as awesome as I feel? How do I do it without coming off a 'cocky'? If I say too little, do I come across as having low self-esteem?

............

Alright, forget this serious stuff. Ladies, I am awesome. Let me list some of my absolutely delightful qualities.

............

1 . I'm decently intelligent. Still going to school (Took a year or two off to work 80 hour weeks because I needed a car where I live) but definitely plan on finishing, majoring in Communications to go in to HR or PR and planning to work in the Game, TV, or Film Industry ideally.

............

B. If you couldn't tell by the end of number one, I really enjoy media. Of all sorts. I especially love introducing people to new things. I've seen the first season of 'Arrested Development' probably 10+ times just introducing it to friends.

............

γ. I'm active! I love hiking, playing tennis, but my current obsession has become playing slow-pitch softball. I play multiple places, a few of them very beginner friendly. I'd love to bring someone with me to play sometime! We could play catch first to get you (re)used to things. I also -love- watching Baseball/Football. Any Giants and 49ers fans, please apply!

............

IV. I'm your typical geek/nerd in that I'm really good with computers. I could work tech support and such if I wanted (Google is your friend, seriously) and I pick up things pretty quickly. 

10÷2. I took French, Italian, and Latin growing up. The first for 11 years, second for 3 years, and the last for almost a year. Can I speak any of them fluently? Not anymore! I'm planning on grabbing Rosetta Stone to pick up French again.

............

110 . No, this isn't the one hundred tenth question. That's binary for '6'. Don't worry, I'm done with the numbering after this. I'm open to just about anything! I'll even try many things twice! I think one of the best things in life is experiencing new things. Let's try something new!

............

Oh, and I'm an awesome karaoke partner.

I'd love to meet someone. Whether it be a online chatting buddy, a movie buddy, or the love of my life. 

There's a lot more to me, but, the rest I feel is better to reveal when chatting with someone. I'm open to texting, AIM, or even Skype, though I forget to turn it on sometimes.

**Here's a picture of me** http://imgur.com/Qn4cc (Don't you wish this was at the beginning of the post?) because we all know that matters most ;P Though, I wear contacts everywhere but home and work, in all honesty.

I'm an ISFJ girl. I'm a little shy, down to earth, goofy, and loyal. I like to think of myself as pretty laid back and drama-free. 

I love to partake in dancing, exploring museums and art galleries, playing video games, reading, pretending to be a photographer, singing karaoke, being out with friends, blogging, going to concerts, watching movies, trying to cook, walking or biking on trails, and catching a drag show at the Gay 90's. 

Overall, I enjoy just about anything that's thrown at me; I always try to find the bright side of things. Life is too short to be bitter and grumpy. I've been workin' on improving my fitness. I've realized life is just too short to be unhappy about anything, including how I feel about my body. I've already lost a total of 42lbs, and I'm still incredibly motivated to lose more. Eventually I hope to be fit enough to take belly dancing classes.

In terms of what I'm looking for in a man, of course there's always the usual: someone with a good sense of humor (I love to laugh), who enjoys life and accepts its challenges. They should be driven, and be fun and lighthearted, but can be serious when the time calls for it.

I do want to make it clear, though, that I'm not looking for guys who only want one-night-stands, FWB, etc. I'd really like to find a nice guy who will treat me right, not treat me like an object, and respect me. I don't think that's too demanding! ;p Of course we'd have to get to know each other first, but I'd like to meet someone with the same goal in mind: to find their soul mate, and not just a booty call.

I crawled out of my shell tried to make a friend, I thought I finally found someone I could relate to, and it turns out she really wasn't into me. In fact.... She is with someone else , in fact she loves that someone else. This has hapoened to me 3 times in my life, and I fear what will happen if I try again. I have been told I am cute and sweet, and passionate, but all these things I could never really tell because I never heard it from someone who sincerely means it with their whole heart. I am lonely, have a family, but nonetheless am still lonely. I didn't have a father to push me in the right direction and my mother was sick with cancer and so many other things to worry about. But most of my encouragement comes from her and my friends (or whoever I can consider a friend). I write this in the dumb hope that someone will care to read and maybe text back.

I turn 25 in *checks watch* 10 minutes.

I am a short and stocky guy. Very athletic, into pretty much any sport both watching and playing. Some favorite rec activities are skiing/snowboarding, downhill mountain biking, ultimate frisbee. Also cool with non-*extreme* activities to pass the time too. I'm graduating from a state college in May with 4 bachelor degrees (don't judge me, made some poor choices in majors my first two years so I just plugged whatever classes in to stay full-time) and over a 3.0 GPA.

I currently don't have any concrete plans for post-graduation, but I'm looking into becoming a substitute teacher for a bit to save up some cash to head West (I'm an East-Coastian) to Arizona, Cali, Colorado, or Texas to name a few places I'm considering. I'm also working on starting my own business and I'm currently one of ten finalists out of the entire state in a business plan competition with my idea.

Here goes nothing!

Lets see here, what have I got going for me? I'm constantly described as freakishly tall. I don't think 6'3"" is freakish, but to each their own. I'm a bit of a hippy and a nerd. I'm extremely liberal in my thinking, have long hair, and yes, I do indulge. People are often freaked out by how chill I am, and I think I can attribute that to the fact that there really isn't much that gets under my skin. Pretty much unless is deliberately trying to piss me off, I can shrug anything off.

I cook! Yes, I'm pretty good at it. All I really have to do is say I'm making burgers and everybody suddenly wants to visit. I'm always looking to try new recipes and looking for them in the Internet. 

I've got a job in IT and I love it. It's decent pay for my experience, easy working environment, and most importantly, in my field of study! Basically, I work as a software tester. My last client was Disney. Pretty interesting story that one.

Nerdy things, hrm. Well, I play some video games. I used to be a WoW addict but these days I only play extremely casually. I still like RPG, RTS, and FPS games almost exclusively. My current gaming list includes halo 4, Borderlands 2, and smite. I also recently picked Magic back up. It is the oldest and best CCG ever to exist. I am also a very vivid Whovian.

I'm not very into sports, but I love outdoor activities. Mountain hiking ad rock climbing are two of my favorites. My family also has a lake place and I often go water-skiing or tubing.

I'm all about my music. I listen mostly punk rock, epic metal (especially with female vocalists), and punk ska. A few examples: Rise Against, Flyleaf, Nightwish, Sirenia, Evanescene, Sonata Arctica. Less than Jake, and Streetlight Manifesto. 

Well, a bit of what I'm looking for. I tend to like girls that can be a bit of a tomboy. I'd prefer that my partner can hang out with me and my friends. After all, she should be my best friend as well, right? I'd like somebody that can enjoy going out and having fun, but is just as happy staying in and being lazy. I think ink is hot, but I currently have none of my own. Similar taste in music is pretty important too. Finally, I believe a relationship should be a partnership, and the best ones involve both people doing everything they can to make each other happy. I do not want and never will want somebody who's ambition is to be the best housewife they can be. Finally, I'd prefer somebody who lives nearby, but if an amazing person comes along that lives across country I wouldn't say no.

Last but not least, a few fair warnings. First, I'm a bit shy in person. Sure, I'll open up once I know you, but in general I'm below average in the quiet department. Secondly, some may refer to me as clingy. I like physical touch and while I'm not at all controlling or obsessive, communication at least daily is important.

That's about it. In a bit I'll put some sort of picture of me up here. I'm not trying to hide anything :p

Looking forward to hearing from you if you made it this far. Ask anything you want, I think you'll find me pretty open.

I'm currently living in Germany but am from Pakistan. I am shy person especially around the ladies but want to change that and decided to post here. I'm looking for someone with whom I can just video/voice/text chat or if possible meet with. 
My interests are:

* Gaming - Not into FPSs, but mostly into strategy, RP and adventure games. (Wishful thinking: A lady co-op partner would be nice :) )

* Music - Metal, but I've started taking interest into other genres as well like ambient, chip tunes, etc. (mostly electronic and just instrumental tracks (devoid of singing)).

* Origami - Not full on 3d models, but simple whatever can keep my head occupied type origami. I love origami.

* Movies - I'm into thriller, animes, suspense and movies that make you go, ""Hey! I wasn't expecting that to happen.."". I also like westerns and old war movies (Von Ryan's Express is my favorite).

*TV Shows: Currently into Fringe, Dexter, The Office and Parks and Recreation.

* Graphic Novels/Comics - To name a few: Sandman, From Hell, Watchmen, PunisherMAX and Y The Last Man.

This made me sad. Ive never actually been on a date before, so I just blargedled out a bunch of random sillyness that popped into me head that I liked.

I feel like what I wrote is a pretty good representation of who I am, though. so I will just do some copy pasting. 

A bit about me, so you know what you are getting into, I am 20 years old, Live in Minnesota, am 6 feet tall, brown hair blue eyes 208 pounds, and I have a few screws loose.

Mostly the boring screws, the ones that get in the way of having fun. But you know, lose screws and all that.

Some more random stuff about me!

I am smart and fun loving and adventurous and kind and romantic. I will take you fun places and tell you interesting stories and make you laugh with my zanny antics and will write you poems and sing you terrible love songs.

Or maybe thats just how I see myself? I dont know. Introspection is so weird.

I do know that I like outdoor stuff, like camping (boundary waters ftw) and fishing. And I have cabin in garrison, a two hour drive north or so, were I go to replenish my soul. and blow up microwaves. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.

I am also for sure a nerd. I like comic books and anime and manga and video games and talking about computers and scinece and stuff. I am also very adventurous, and must annually go on some type of adventure in order to maintain my sanity. Biking, hitching, normal hiking, road trips, canoe trips, I've done them all!

Next summer, I am either going to go on a hitchhiking trip round the great lakes, or go kyacking down the Mississippi. I would love to have a partner!

I am also probably one of the most polite people you will ever meet. yay for shaking hands and please and thank you!

Some people call me immature, and others call me mature. I like to think of myself as immature when I am having fun and trying to get others to have fun, but mature when i am working and having a serious conversation.

If I had to describe my self in one word, I would say whimsical, wonder-filled and wanderlusty.

Enough about me and my self delusions, what am I looking for in a partner?

Well, I am looking for a girl. Or, more accurately, a smart girl. If you read books, watch/read the news, and are interested in knowing for the sake of knowing, then you are the girl I am looking for!

But that's a bit broad... I guess what I am specifically looking for is someone I can go on adventures with. A girl I can randomly call up and say ""wanna go sledding?"" and you will say ""LETS DO IT"" and we go sledding.

Or a girl who is willing to put up with frequent pauses in the conversation as we mull over the implications of various philosophical topics. And then we say screw it and make Calvin and Hobbes snowmen on the side of the road and see how much we can slow down traffic.

You have to be nice and stuff too. That more important then the other stuff.

So ladies, PM me if you want to talk more (or if you just want a slice of pizza) and put your favorite fictional character in the subject line, so I know your not a spam bot. Not that I have anything against bots, in fact if you are a cyborg by all means reply. I have always wanted to meet a cyborg....

Wait, are bots even a problem on reddit? I have no idea. no one reply to my other posts. oh well.

If you are a dude, sorry, I am only romantically interested in girls. However, if you are reading this and you think to yourself ""this guy sounds like lots of fun to go on an adventure with"" you should Pm me as well. I am always in the market for new friends.

I live in West St. Paul, by the way. Not the west part of St. Paul, the town West St. Paul. The town is south of St. Paul and west of South St. Paul.

Since then, I've moved to a rather unrefined town (full of white trash) and I'm just not getting by well here and I wish I there was someone I could be close buddies with.

I'm on the poorer side of things. I'm on a kick of 'poor man's' and 'cowboy' recipes to make my sad excuse of food choices feel kind of cool. I didn't have enough money for college, however I didn't want to attend anyways. Although my future seems to be leaning towards agriculture anyways.

Biking is slowly becoming my main passion (probably because I'll never be able to afford a car) I'm out on my bike for at least a few hours every day. It feels incredible to have some shorts on and flipflops and cruise about town with no boundaries on my days off. Nothing better than stepping out of my house, feeling the warm sun on my skin and breeze in my face. Sometimes I go barefoot if I have no where important to go, the hot pavement on my feet feels awesome. Usually I'll get a something to cheap to eat and sit at the beach for a few hours. Or I have some awesome trails near me, bikes aren't allowed on them but I don't give a toss. (Biking anywhere with 'No Bicycles' signs is fun too.)

Also dogs. They're hilarious and never fail to cheer me up. I walk dogs at the local animal shelter on the side of my other job in retail, I've been hoping to adopt some of the pit bulls there. Anyways, I'm quiet and a bit of a loner, and so I really like other quiet people who don't mind that. I would kind of prefer someone else who isn't attending college either, and likes pit bulls/bigger dogs in general.

I'm a friendly female who is moving to northeast Florida in a few days to start a brand new job. I just graduated with a second Bachelor's degree, which means I've spent the last four years or so dedicated to studying and pretty much ignoring my social life.   I'm fortunate to have a few wonderful, close girlfriends. However, make companionship continues to elude me. 

I discovered Reddit awhile back and felt that I found my crazy, wonderful, and all around diverse tribe. I have many interests ranging from politics to science to Doctor Who (and Breaking Bad and Firefly and Louie and Masterpiece Theater...) to self improvement to books and games and anything that arches my fancy. 

So, what's my point? I'm simply looking to email/chat with a friendly guy who'd like to share his interests, too.

 So say hello! Who knows? Maybe a solid friendship or more might result. 

Edit:  Just reviewed this and realized that there is a slight possibility that it could be interpreted that I'm seeking the sexy times, so let me clear that up.  I am looking for guy friends with the possibility that, if we hit it off, that *could* turn into dating.  I am in no way seeking FWBs, or any variation on FWBs. Got it? Good :)

Edit 2: Age range... 25-51 (the young enough/old enough to be a biological parent rule... er... is that a thing? I think it's a thing.)

Never thought I'd be doing this and I don't know exactly what to call what I'm looking for, so I'll try to spell it out clearly as I can without limiting possibilities. I'm a 23 year old male from central Texas, but I'm currently living abroad as a technology teacher in the small African country of Burundi. I live with two other white men, both of which I am good friends with. However I have as of late been feeling rather lonely. At first I thought it was home sickness, but I am pretty sure the root cause is simply the lack of community I have here combined with zero women that I find attractive. So enough with the sob story... I'm looking for an upgraded pen-pal I guess. I have a couple pen-pals from /r/penpals[1] [1] (which is really cool btw), but I am now looking for a woman close to my own age (+ or - 5 years) that is willing to be penpals, and if things work out, consider taking things a bit deeper and more intimate emotionally. I don't want to force anything though, and I'm always up for more pen-pals if that's the case! So Yeah, I guess I'd call what I'm looking for e-mail/pen-pal dating... since I can't do the real thing over here (even if there were women I could speak to and found attractive, In Burundi you don't date... you just get married...). I'm not looking for smutty pictures or people that want to sext or whatever. I'm more interested in just getting to know some women my age and being able to talk about random shit from the woes of university or co-workers, to preferred types of toothpaste, to serious and meaningful conversations on life, the universe, and everything. 

That was quite a wall of text. Anyway a little about me for those of you who haven't already closed the tab. As I said, I'm 23, from Central Texas where I was born and raised. I went to university there as well, and graduated with a double major in philosophy and geography. I don't know why I chose those other than I like thinking deeply and I liked taking classes where I got to color maps instead of writing essays. now, I'm in Gitega, Burundi, teaching at a new private school. This christians organization got the idea it'd be smart to bring a couple white folks out to build their new school. So that's what we did. I designed the curriculum, and now I'm teaching technology. After my time here, I have no idea where I'll end up, but international political analysis sounds fun and sexy. You know. Bond-esque. More on that if you and I start e-mailing. I'm an avid reader and writer (although I'm no good I write everyday), and I have a love for film, music, maps, cars, and reptiles. I am a staunch atheist. I like extremes and tend to sway towards them. Um... what else??? Well that's either enough for you to PM me or close the tab I guess. Either way if you got this far, thanks for reading. In conclusion, if there's any woman out there who is crazy or bold or adventurous enough to give this a try, PM and let me know. Send me something about you. Yup. Oh, and please don't waste my time if you think you might be the kind of pen-pal to just suddenly stop writing! Those people suck! 

Also, here's pictures for your consideration. And, as shameful as it is to admit, I would consider looks in order to move anything into the ""upgraded"" pen-pal status, so a picture of you would be nice :-)

Basically, I'm looking to see what I can find. Que sera sera, right?

So, after that, a bit about me to entice you in:

-I love to read. I'll sit down and read an entire book in a day, stopping only to eat, drink, and use the facilities.

-I like to cook, and I'm pretty awesome at it. Ask me for my specialities- I can guarantee there'll be something to make your mouth water.

-I'm English. Yes, I come with an accent.

-Speaking of accents, I'm pretty good at faking a few, and I'm particularly good at Irish.

-I love to play games, especially anything with even a hint of customisation in it. I've played some really shitty things because of that customisation, believe you me.

-I play a couple of instruments; no, not well, but I play them.

-I have a headful of trivia that will never, ever be useful outside of a pub quiz.

-I'm sarcastic, and witty, and I like to make people laugh. If you 'get' my sense of humour, you're right in.

    I write. Stories, poems, random snippets of whatever.

-I like photography; I'm always looking out for the 'right' angle or light or whatever.

-I'm awesome. That's no lie.

-I'm a Taoist.

-I'm an award-winning poet. Ask me about it, if you like.

I've been following this subreddit since very early on, and while I have commented on other FA dating posts, I've never really responded to any of them. It could be because I'm a SAP, but probably has to do with not wanting to come off like some dirty old man perv. You're all so young.

Yet here I am. I am in fact 40 years old, 5' 9"" and 210 pounds. I do not in fact look 40, or so I am told. I think I do, but I still get carded going into bars (which I don't do but maybe once or twice a year) or buying alcohol in stores (again, don't do much, about once a month I get a six-pack of beer). Despite being FA, I still have high standards. If you are older than me, I'm probably not going to be interested. If you weigh more than me, I'm also probably not going to be interested.

I have an old picture somewhere (probably 4 or so years old) that I could share. I don't have much of an ego, so I don't do a lot of self pics.

So what do I do? I tell people I do as little as possible. I, in full disclosure, do suffer from asperger's syndrome and suffer from chronic severe depression. Because of these things, I am on disability and don't work. I did manage to struggle through college and got a bachelor's degree in Anthropology. Most of my day is spent, currently (my interests can fluctuate frequently) playing EQ2 or trying to read classic novels. Currently I'm reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. Typically I read sci-fi and fantasy. Some TV show I currently am watching: The Big Bang Theory, HIMYM, Doctor Who, Weeds (DON'T KILL ANDY!), Fringe, and others.

So, I think that's more than enough. If you want to know more, drop me a line. Don't be offended if I don't respond, I am FA and SAP, and I might simply not know what to say or how to respond.

I mostly just have 'work' friends, people I talk to at work but don't hang out with afterwards.

I went to college for CS, however I don't think they taught/prepared me enough for that career field so I'm kinda re-teaching myself to become a web developer. I'm no where near an expert in anything yet.

I suppose I have a dry/morbid sense of humor.... And I cook really well.

I've never done anything like this before so I'm not really sure what to expect when/if I get replies. Maybe just talk or something over aim/skype, then meet up somewhere (public) after we get to know each other?

I'm probably not the most interesting person in the world, sometimes during car rides I'm very quiet, as well as restaurants or anywhere that has loud music playing in the background...

I am a 21 year old male Electrical Engineering major at Texas A&amp;M, planning to pursue Law School upon graduation to become an Intellectual Property Attorney.

I'm going to be very busy and won't have much free time during the semesters as a lot of it will be spent in lab/studying, but if you're also an A&amp;M/Blinn student we can study together. When I do have free time, I want to spend it with someone who really cares about and has an interest in me and my mind.

I have very strong political opinions, and will share as much as you want to hear/be a part of. Fortunately, that's just one subject of conversation I embark upon with passion - and unfortunately, passionate curiosity and deep discussion tends to turn off most girls I've met. But, if you are ready to talk about the rate of change of technology and how it shapes the world around us, what wave-particle duality really means for existence, or why people behave the way they do, etc., I would love to have someone to talk to - especially if they have input back. There is little I love more than listening.

I will be up front: I am a bit out of shape. Starting August, however, I am getting DDR pads set up in front of a huge canvas set up to a projector. I would also love someone to play DDR with at least an hour every day during the week - would help me to stay motivated.

Also, because I believe it is unfair not to share this before meeting: I have been married before. There was a girl I was dating for about six months, and we were both pretty convinced we would get married after we finish school, and when my parents cut me off financially we got married for the tax benefits that would allow us to get grants and loans to pay for school. Between financial stress &amp; her very different moral system, when she changed birth control it all broke. However, as someone who was married for 6 months, I do know what kind of dedication it is, and am capable of commitment - that said, just getting out of a divorce, I'm looking for someone to spend my remaining two undergrad years with, and if they go well, maybe the years after.

I've probably ruled out a lot just by being in College Station, not having as much free time as other people, and making people endure the wall-o-text, but if you've spent the time to read this, and are interested, send me a message. If I don't get back to you immediately worry not; it may be a few days because of school/work/etc., but the response will come.",,False,,t5_2sdpe,False,,,True,t3_wvsks,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/wvsks/21m4f_college_station_tx_engineering_student_for/,

I'm an 18 year old female who will soon be fleeing suburbia and moving to Manhattan for college. I feel that my entire life has been the preamble to actually emerging into the world and exploring the dark corners and dusty recesses of my own brain. 

My favorite show ever is Firefly, but my guilty pleasure is The Celebrity Apprentice. I love painting and art. I can bang around on a piano or guitar, but I'm currently attempting to play acoustic bass. I enjoy video games, and yes, Wow. I write poetry and love to thrift shop. I have been working on a book for the past two years, but it's not nearly well-written enough to be published. One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies and criticizing/reviewing them. I like to think I have a good sense of humor. I'm ""weird.""


I have never been close with anyone, besides an ex-boyfriend who broke my heart in January. I have yet to find someone who I trust completely, and who I can share my thoughts with. In general, I get along with older people. I'm definitely an introvert, but I'm comfortable in social situations. I hate Disneyland.  I'm a night person. I love experimenting with drugs and altered states of consciousness. I'm really pretentious when it comes to music and literature. It's something I've devoted a large portion of my life to, and I'd love to discuss it at length. I'm not at all athletic or interested in sports, so if that's important to you we probably won't get along so well. 
 

Age doesn't much concern me, as I'm sure we can find a common ground. I generally get along much better with males than females, but I'm not opposed to females messaging me. If you're in the NYC area, we can hang out in the fall. I'm blonde, 5'6, 115 lbs, and I get freckles in the sun. I'm attracted to people much smarter than I am and people who can show me new things. I don't really care what you look like, as long as you take care of yourself and present yourself well. Most importantly, I want to talk to a person who can intellectually challenge me and form mutual trust. I have no one in my life that I can tell everything to, and conversely no one who I can listen to and care enough to help with their problems.

I should start by talking about me! I am 25 years old, 5'9, and 180lbs. I would describe my body type as somewhere between average and athletic. I would be more than willing to send a picture to anyone interested. 

I graduated college about 2.5 years ago and have had a steady job since. My hobbies would include video games, traveling, movies, music, snowboarding, paintballing, and anything else nerdy really.

What I am looking for in a girl is fairly simple. I am looking for someone who is ready to date seriously. I am ready to retire from the single scene and settle down with someone. Some attributes that I deem desirable in a girl: Live a healthy lifestyle! Be a nerd! Be friendly and optimistic rather than depressing and pessimistic! Be cute! Don't expect me to do everything to push the relationship along! (I seem to have bad luck when it comes to this one)

I am totally fine with things starting out as a long distance relationship. If things really work out then we can figure out the logistics of getting physically together later on :).

Why am I posting on reddit do you ask? Well, it is pretty simple really. I feel that sharing hobbies with someone and being able to enjoy things together and very very important to a working relationship. Females on Reddit are much more likely to share my hobbies than anywhere else.

This ended up much longer than I had initially intended. To sum up: I am a 25 year old nerd that is tired of being single and ready to settle down with a nice girl. I hope to hear back from some of you :)

You are a Goddess. You deserve to be treated like one.  I would be honored to do so.

You deserve to be worshipped, to be pampered, to have your every whim indulged by your devoted partner and servant.

That's me.  I will worship you physically, emotionally, and sexually.  I will be responsible for any and all domestic tasks, errands, and chores.  I will memorize various submissive positions to demonstrate my subservience.  I will be available for your idle entertainment in whatever way you desire.

I am 22, 6'1"", fit and handsome.  I have valuable skills that will allow me to make a good living anywhere in the country.  You need not work if you don't want to.

I am 100% serious about this.  All I ask from you is that you are serious as well. It's ok if you're reluctant, but you must have the capacity to grow accustomed to such a lifestyle and begin to expect it.

Please message me if you are interested.

**My self-summary**

I am a business consultant with a retirement company and I am attending school for a Master's degree in Business. I'm definitely a geek. I love learning new things, whether it be programming languages, cultural languages (currently on Swedish), astrology, quantum physics or history. I love going to concerts for local and international acts alike, visiting the theatre, going to art museums, photography, or anything art-like really. I also enjoy watching football (soccer), american football, hockey and even basketball when the playoffs are around. Baseball too, but only for the ballpark environment. For video games, I typically enjoy RPG, strategy, or puzzle games.


Some other activities I enjoy are taking out my ATV and four-wheeling, paintball, bowling, rafting, hiking, etc.


I am a musician so I'd appreciate if you understood my passion for music. That being said, I am currently in a band and I do perform shows. Sometimes I may fly out of the state or country to record an album with another band.


I have a sarcastic sense of humor but I can make just about anyone laugh. I consider myself more agnostic or pagan than anything else when it comes to religion, but not serious at all about it. I'm a very friendly person with anyone and I'm very selfless (Ex: I like to do volunteer work and donate thousands of dollars to charities a year).

**What I’m doing with my life**

I am currently working full-time as an Associate Business Consultant at a private Retirement company. I am also attending college online for Business Management. Home owner for 3 years, car owner, etc. I have pretty high expectations for myself and plan on being a director within 5 years, VP of a major company within 15.

**TV Shows:** Family Guy (first three seasons), The Simpsons, Uranium, Headbangers ball, House MD, Bones, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Weeds, Big Bang Theory, 1000 Ways to Die, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, etc.


**Movies:** Any good suspense/horror or philosophical movie. I love foreign films too. Donny Darko, Fight Club, Gladiator, V for Vendetta, Freddy vs Jason, Ice Age, ReCycle, Big Fish, Stardust, Saw series, Cube, Exorcist, Exorcist: The Beginning, Troy, Pirates of the Caribbean, Enemy at the Gates, Amityville Horror (classic), Memories of Murder, and any Disney cartoon are just some examples.


**Music:** I love metal, industrial, new age and classic rock. I will listen to anything though. According to Last.fm, my favorite bands are:Vader, Behemoth, Dimmu Borgir, Symphony X, Carnal Forge, Sevendust, Aborted, Kataklysm, Arch Enemy, Carpathian Forest, Dark Funeral, etc.

The big problem is that I'm in an area of the US that I really dislike. The people around me are, for the most part, extremely conservative politically and very Christian, which is not how I am, which is not necessarily a terrible thing, but has become somewhat exhausting, and makes it hard to relate to people. So I'm not setting out to find anyone in my area, which is a problem for some people. 

I'm both a really serious and really goofy person. I take everything I love with great importance, study really hard in school, put time into my work, try my hardest to be there for all of my friends. I'm a pretty smart person, and I love having conversations about big picture philosophy and pop culture and media and the meaning of life and tons of other cerebral stuff. But it gets exhausting sometimes, and I also enjoy watching cartoons, making dumb puns, talking in weird voices, and being generally immature. I really can't get along with anyone who can't have that sort of duality in their personality. Also, another thing that might be a deal-breaker for potential love interests is that I'm overweight. It's not something that I'm mega-self conscious about (although I have my days, but don't we all?). I've been working toward changing my habits to a more healthy, but I hate the mentality of treating my body like some broken down old car that's constantly needing repair and fixing. 

Relationships can't be built on common interests alone, but I might as well throw mine out here. I'm a total pop culture junkie, and I really enjoy talking at length about books/TV/movies that I'm into, sharing theories and favorites and generally analyzing it all. Im also really inyo music and seeing live shows, but my tastes are a little odd in that realm. My biggest obsession right now is the ASOIAF series; I'm in the middle of the second book but caught up on the GoT show and could basically talk about that for half a century or so. I love tons of books, sci fi and fantasy as well as realism and just plain fiction. As for TV, I love Community, Arrested Development, Archer, Doctor Who, Breaking Bad, Adventure Time, Pushing Daisies, and probably a bazillion others that I can't think of. My taste in movies is just as all over the place. I LOVE documentaries, especially human-interest type ones that follow one or several people. I've never been able to outgrow Disney films, not sorry about it either. Pretty much anything well written will take my heart, and I have a propensity for comedy ranging from black to dry to stoner. I have a bit of a creepy streak in my interests, not so much blood and gore, but monsters and death (I've watched several documentaries on the funeral industry and am totally fascinated by it.) 

Overall, I'm looking for someone who I can talk to. I like guys who are emotional, who aren't afraid to express their feelings and communicate openly. I am a super passionate person, and I like to see that in others as well. I find myself most attracted to compassionate and considerate guys. If you have your own interested and passions and goals in your life that you get excited about, then we'll probably get along just fine. I'm searching for someone I can have tons of late nights talking and laughing on Skype and really connect with. I like body types of all shapes and sizes; I really fall for faces more than anything. 

So yeah, if any of that sounds good to you, shoot me a message! :D

I'm also not even sure if I this is just me getting shit off my chest, or if this will even ever leave my text editor.

Basically, I've been feeling enorma-fucking-ously lonely lately. I don't have anyone to confide in and it seems like I'm drifting away from any chance of anything resembling a normal relationship. I've been trying on the interwebs for years now, particularly on reddit &amp; OkCupid, with varying amounts of effort &amp; varying yet little success. I mean, on the surface of it I don't think going out with me would be a particularly bad deal. I'm college-educated and I've got a good job and make good money, but I've never flaunted it. I'm probably a totally average 5/10 at best in the face, but I'm fairly fit and tall. I am generally a bit of a homebody, but I always get my ass in gear and plan things out when I'm going out with someone. I try to consider people as they are rather that according my expectations of them. Ditto for the relationships themselves. I'm good at taking criticism -- as long as it is immature or hateful, and I'll always take the fact that someone's stuck around over it. Sometimes I think people take me too seriously, and are intimidated enough to not be open about these things. I've got pretty progressive, live and let live views that I think would appeal to most anybody who considers themselves insane, including reasonable feminists. I'm not super geeky, in that I don't have an obsessive, one track mind about my hobbies, but I still have passions and relate to people who are passionate too. I go well with fanboys &amp; girls, you could say. I always try to be respectful in general and in relation to sex. I'm about as far from a ""dick pic"" guy as you could get, but I'm still very sex positive. I may move too slow for someone, but I'm working on being forward and more dominant. One of my biggest weaknesses is probably that I trust too much and I fall too quickly. On the other hand, people seem far too reserved and unnecssarily ""hard to get."" I think the world'd be nicer if we were less isolated on average.

And I mean, I don't think my standards are out of whack. Basically, if you're in my age range, you're healthy, consider average looks at best or better, and have similar world views you're solidly in the running. And by healthy, I don't even necessarily mean skinny, I can dig a curvy girl too. You wouldn't even really need to have your life together. Honestly, I'd love to have someone rely on me (see title). I'm pretty suspicious of permanently happy go lucky people, and I think flaws can be attractive.

Ah well. This stream of consciousness has dried out, and I feel a little better. If you want someone to vent to, or talk about anything at all, grab a throwaway and send me a message. I'd like to keep things anonymous to defer any pressure to not be completely open. I highly doubt I'll get more than a message or two, but I'll just let you know if I'm already chatting with someone. I don't like half-assed chats and I won't subject you to one.

It's so hard to find women my age that aren't taken or drunks in my town.  Is it too much to ask to find someone who wants to possibly build a relationship together?  

I'm 27 years old, 6'2"" tall, brown hair, green eyes and 160lbs.  I've been told I am good looking and I take care of myself, so I sorta think it's true, haha!  

My main problem with dating recently is that there is no real good place to meet women my age in this town besides (a) when I am at work (and I feel creepy hitting on women that come in) and (b) at the bar (which I am SO over.)  Most of the women I have met here are flighty and are not looking for a future, which is frustrating!  

So yeah, I like funny movies, cooking, riding/racing bicycles, hanging out, gardening, watching funny stuff on netflix, exploring, roadtripping, camping, fishing and doing silly stuff.  I just want a partner to share this life with and to build a future with (if it feels right...)

I want to fall head over heals in love with a beautiful woman, have a modest, clean, nice house with a big back yard and a garden and just love as much as I can.  I love having someone to cook with, to clean the house with, to go on road trips with, to lay in the back yard and watch the stars with, just to be with!

I have no car, no computer (ipad for reddit and skype), and am currently unemployed though I am searching everywhere.

**What I Like:** I'm in to gaming and not much else, but I don't dislike much. Before my computer died I played a lot of WoW, Skyrim, and DoTA2. As for TV I like Frasier, anything on Cartoon Network, American Dad and Conan. Lately being on my own I find myself doing more and more handiman type things to get by, like mowing, painting, which i enjoy. I've even had a little experience as a librarian and a landscaper recently. My favorite food is chinese but my favorite meal is fish and chips.

**Who I Am:** Im 5'11"" 190-195lbs. Brown hair, blue eyes, bearded and glasses. Average nerdy guy. I consider myself to be a nice guy with an open mind, I was raised and taught with honor, respect, and the golden rule. Being out on my own has humbled me quite a bit, I'm bad with people and a quiet person so directly asking people out who I find attractive has always been awkward for me.

**Who I'm Looking For:**What I would love is someone who is just starting out, same as me, that I can share my experience with and grow and learn with. However at the end of the day I'm just another lonely human being so if that isn't you and you just want to say ""hey"" please be my guest.

I'm not picky at all when it comes to looks, personality is what gets me. I'm a lovey dovey guy and I feel uncomfortable in relationships where I don't get much affection in return. Age doesn't play a huge role for me either, if you feel young then that's how I'll see you.

I'm now 27 as of a week ago, and I don't really connect with a lot of people. I'm a perfectionist in everything I do, and if I can't do something perfectly I won't even try. It's a curse. I'm currently going to community college after having someone come and tear my heart out of my chest while it was still beating. I have a problem with disconnecting constantly and am very hard to keep a conversation with considering i make jumps to random subjects because my brain likes to work faster then my mouth.

I play magic a lot, but i wouldn't say it's something I enjoy. More or less, my friends play it so i do by proxy to try to keep something in common to talk about. I enjoy computer games and all sorts of awkwardly tedious things related to gaming. My favorite game of all time is Final Fantasy XI and i am super excited for the remake of 14.

Im not very mobile after having fusion surgery on my back, so I usually only go to school, or across town to a friends house to hang out. I've been denied painkillers for my back after being hospitalized for depression, so now i have limited ways to ease then incredible pain that I live with every day. So basically all i can do is use medical marijuana if i'm awake, or just sleep. Great choices right?

On a typical day, I am over at a friends watching tv shows, or just random video game news. I typically will play through old platformers for snes and nes. My friends think that I'm really good at games, so they like to have me play all sorts of them for their entertainment.

I love to cook, and to try new food. I also have a terrible sweet tooth. Another thing that I enjoy doing is creating things, whether its recipes, or just an awkward shelf with speakers in it to put under my computer monitor. I look at the world through a very unusual monocle in which I don't really feel hatred towards people, but instead feel empathy towards everything. It's a very beautiful chaos over here.

Yes, I actually live in NC!!!",10,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1azokl/m4f_26_yes_i_actually_live_in_nc/,"Congratulations on your brand new copy of FAD: me edition! I've posted here a few months ago. It led to meeting some pretty cool people, but nothing that could become a relationship. I really see no reason to not give it another go.

Well then, a bit about me. I'm a bit of a hippy, very left wing in my political views and 4/20 friendly. I have a good job that pays enough and has room to expand my career. However, I will never want to, nor will I ever be, be the sort of person that gives up on living life for their work. I am also rather romantic. I'm the type of person that wants to help as many people as possible make their lives better, and that just gets compounded in a relationship. I've also considered the possibility that I just get a kick out of her bragging to her friends :p I can also be a bit reserved, especially around somebody new, but I'm not akward.

I'm also a hopeless nerd. Dr. Who is the best show ever crafted by human hands. I also play many different video games, ccgs, etc. to name a few: Skyrim, Pokemon, Borderlands, MTG, Smite, LoL, WoW, Left 4 Dead. However, I can't sit on my ass for than about a day without wanting to do something. I spend a lot of time at the family lake place, water skiing, burning things, and other various lake activities. Rock climbing, hiking, and camping are also included on my list of awesome things to do.

I get real into my music, and admittedly very few people enjoy the same choices I do. Live shows are wicked, and I would like to go to more. A few artists include Less Than Jake, Streetlight manifesto, Rise Against, Nightwish, Flyleaf, Paramore, Sonata Arctica, Reel Bug Fish, and Blind Guardian.

I believe that a relationship should be a team effort. Couples where the guy does everything for the girl and vice versa are complete abominations of the definition. As a fair warning though, I can be slightly clingy. Not stalker level ""why you haven't texted back its been 5 mins!"", but I do like to spend a lot of time with my other in relationships and talking daily is a must! Cuddling is good too!

Now, a bit about you! Quite frankly the most important quality a SO could have is sharing the same opinion on relationships as I do. I also like kids and all, but I've got some personal issues when somebody else's kid is in the picture. Sorries! I'm emotionally open, and I'd hope you would at least be able to speak to me. Distance isnt a huge concern for me, but I would try to fix that as soon as it is reasonable. Short hair, ink (to a level), and hair dye are hot. You should also be a self-proclaimed badass. Being a bit kinky never hurt either.

**Music**: I love mostly alternative stuff. My absolute favorite bands are Nirvana, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, A Day To Remember, and Linkin Park. I also really love Jeff Buckley, John Frusciante, The Smashing Pumpkins, Tears For Fears, and The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, to name a few.

**Movies:** I love comedies like Elf and Zoolander, psychological thrillers like The Butterfly Effect and Memento, and emotional movies like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and Donnie Darko.

**TV Shows:** My favorite TV shows as of now are Breaking Bad and South Park. But mostly Breaking Bad :)

Oh, and I also love books though I haven't been the most active at reading since last summer. Some of my favorites are The Outsiders, Fahrenheit 451, and the Hunger Games, Divergent, and Maze Runner trilogies.

I consider myself an honest/raw/friendly/happy person, and just nothing for me has ever worked out relationship wise.

like taller guys. So I'm looking for a girl who likes a short guy!

With that been said, lets go to the wall of text! 

* About me. 

I'm a guy who's all about respect. I'll respect you and who you are. I'm a genuinely nice guy, willing to step out of my way to do something for you. Stuck home sick craving for something? count me in to get it for you, eat with you  and be with you until you feel better! I like to joke around a lot and can be bitterly sarcastic sometimes.
I'm a college student with a part time job, yet somehow I still have a lot of time for myself.

* Hobbies. 

My passion is music. I play the clarinet, piano, and the guitar. If I find a song that I like, I will listen to it no matter what kind, so I would love to hear your favorite music! I seem to have a talent with drawing as well, so I'd love to draw you something! I also love origami!

* Interests.

I love science, especially astronomy! If you can quote anything from Carl Sagan, we'll get along just fine. I play sports or even just walk around the city with no particular destiny to stay active. I play video games but not really a gamer. Favorite TV shows are House, Dexter, Doctor Who, The Walking Dead, and How I Met Your Mother. I enjoy watching an episode or two of Whose Line Is It Anyways before going to sleep. What better way to fall sleep than with a smile on your face!

* What I'm looking for.

I'm looking to meet a girl who can be completely honest. A girl who can be outgoing and open for new adventures. Be active with me and be willing to challenge me. I love it when a girl playfully challenges me. I like a girl who's not afraid of making the first move, and definitely a girl who makes an effort. I like having long conversations about anything and I'm really good at listening, so I would love to listen about your day! I want to know about your favorite songs, your favorite movies, your hobbies and your interests. I want to get to know you! A girl who likes to goof and joke around. I'm looking for someone who will care and make an effort, because I know I will!

Ask for pic and you shall receive!

Well I did have to kill about 500 million of my fellow comrades to be here. My favourite protein is helicase, cause it unzips your genes. Those are just some of the one-liners regarding my field off the top of my head and if you're still reading and interested, Woohoo! 

So I do have a minor in Writing, Rhetoric and Critical analysis but for the life of me, it's easier to comment on the ekphrasis qualities of Anne Sexton's Starry Night than write about my self. Mostly I attribute it to my slight (OK, quite a bit of) introvertial tendencies but I do like to do stuff with a small group of people (Like a Cat?, or Firefox with a Bank's Website?). Moreover, I'm very enthused about taking photographs, mainly of natural beauty, in all its shapes and forms, but this has so far been strictly relegated to the sphere of money draining hobbies (I understand a lot of people make money off of it).

I do have a great appreciation of the arts and would love to draw (If I could) and play (If I could). But my analytical upbringing in the biological sciences and an equivalent love for the physical sciences has  often put me at crossroads, contemplating the meaning of life and trying to reconcile the physical and the abstract,assigning real world value to the notion of happiness and satisfaction. Needless to say I enjoy Numb3rs (Game theory optimized to evaluate friendships yay!). Keeping in line with the 'abstrackt'ness of my likings, I enjoy musicians like Ulrich Schnauss, Boards of Canada, Plaid, NIN, Casino Versus Japan, Marimaru, Mogwai, Deftones, Team Sleep etc. (People who don't have a lot of lyrics in their music, as I feel words impose the feeling of the artist, whereas just music is more malleable and moulds into the listeners feeling, rather than shape it).

I guess I'm looking for someone who is equally interested in looking at life, deeper than second hand accounts and experience all its got to offer. From Rakfisk to Challenger's Deep. Oh right - 25yo, 5'7"", Black hair and Brown Eyes, of Indian descent. I would add an image up on this if I wasn't so damn introvert.

Sometimes I give good advice! [Sometimes...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8l0YM5Y9lA)

Anyways, a bit about myself. I'm a nerdy guy! I'm into all kinds of games, from board games (both the classic kinds and the EuroGaming, Fantasy Flight Games kind), to card games (I love Texas Hold'Em), to pen-and-paper games (I've played DnD 3rd and 4th, Changling: The Lost, Warhammer RPG, and Legend of the Five Rings RPG, and I wouldn't mind finding a group!), and, of course, video games! I play a lot of games on Steam and I'm a big League of Legends player! I like FPSs, strategy and simulation games, RPGS, and a number of unusual games. Aside from gaming, I love to go to the movies and eat out, especially at new places. I love all kinds of food and sometimes I subject my family to my cooking experiments! Aside from gaming, I love to roleplay on the internets and I do some amateur short story writing in fantasy and horror genres. I'm hoping to get some of my work published. I have a strong interest in reading horror short stories and pretty much anything in the horror and gothic genres. One of my favorite game series is the Silent Hill series. I also have an avid interest in pets and some amateur gardening, including carnivorous plants. I have a mild interest in anime, mostly in reading some niche manga, especially romantic ones. I do have a pervy bent and I enjoy some good hentai. I know what I like and while I'm understanding of others, I'm not afraid to speak my mind or ask direct questions. I feel the best and freest when I'm allowed to said whatever I wish. But at heart I'm a compassionate person, so I'm not given to speaking rudely or unkindly. I like to joke a lot as well ^ ^

I am working as a library assistant at UTSA and I love my job! I have a BA in History and a BA in English and I hope to continue going to college soon. I have many things I hope to engage in when I save up a good nest egg, including martial arts. I'm keenly interested in Krav Maga and Jeet Kune Do. I, regretfully, still live with my folks since I graduated late from college, but I'm saving up to strike out on my own.

What am I looking for? Anything and everything. A friend, a lover, a girlfriend, and anything in between. I'm open to just chatting, on AIM, YIM, MSN, or Skype, or just trading messages on Reddit. I'm open to looking for some good friends to hang out with, but I don't drink or get high. I'm not really interested in the bar or club scene. I'm always looking for new friends and good times. In the end, I hope to find someone special to game with and be sexy with, especially Diablo 3, Borderlands 2, that kind of stuff. Those count as gaming AND sexy!

I enjoy films, either good ones, or so-bad-they're-good ones. I like meeting people, going out for meals, or cooking, I pride myself on being a good cook. Reading, gaming etc, all the usual.

I can't dance, or swim. But I can do the Robot, and Slow dancing..

I'll try most things, and I love to learn, see, do new things. One day I'd love to travel, perhaps write a book about what I've seen and done..

To start, I'm in information technology, nothing really specific. I'm employed and firmly rooted where I am, for the next few years. I live in the North.

I'm shy but when I eventually become less shy, I open up about things and I guess I can be a little giggly and bubbly. I like video games and the outdoors equally, I don't like to be stuck on either one. I'm not fond of bar scenes, but I think sitting around and playing dungeons and dragons while having some drinks with friends is pretty much an ideal Saturday night.

I guess I think it would be cool if someone just made an effort. I'm a little reclusive but with the right prompting I can be a good companion. I've tried making efforts before, and it's turned into... well, for naught. It's kind of hurt my confidence.

I was raised by hilarious perverts who taught me classic chivalry to balance out my eventual insanity. In Florida, not into anime (beyond the shitty Americanized stuff that the WB played when I was a child that I have an affinity for based solely on nostalgia, i.e. Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon), love reading, playing video games, writing and in the last month alone I've re-watched more television than most people I know have possibly ever seen in their entire lives.

Let's see if there are any things we have in common.

Music I listen to most frequently include:

* Jonathan Coulton
* Wheatus
* Mindless Self Indulgence
* Schaffer the Darklord
* The Protomen
* Alien Ant Farm
* MC Frontalot
* An eclectic mix of electro/metal

I've also recently become friends with a few nerdcore DJ's and am slowly getting more into digital music, which is wholly new to me. The nerdcore genre/scene is a huge part of my music collection.

I read a lot. Too much at times. Mostly books and a few magazines I am subscribed to, though a few comic compendiums make their way in. My favorites are:

* House of Leaves (Mark Z. Danielewski)
* Breathers: A Zombie's Lament (S.G. Browne)
* Y: The Last Man (Brian K. Vaughan)
* Lullaby (Chuck Palahniuk)
* You Suck (Christopher Moore)
* Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal (Christopher Moore)
* Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter,Witch (Neil Gaiman,Terry Pratchett)
* American Gods (Neil Gaiman)
* Relentless (Dean Koontz)

Movie wise a lot of science fiction weasels it's way in, and time travel seems to be a recurring theme in some of my favorites, such as:

* Primer
* Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel
* Unbreakable
* Clerks
* Hot Fuzz
* District 9
* The Incredibles
* Idiocracy
* Beetlejuice

TV wise, I've seen a lot, but my favorites include:

* Breaking Bad (easily my favorite show of all time)
* Doctor Who
* Community
* The League (I hate sports, but I love this show)
* Farscape
* Chuck
* The Fades
* Dexter (most of it)
* Saturday Night Live
* Stargate SG-1
* Everything in the Whedonverse, even Dollhouse to some extent
* The Brak Show

My gaming knowledge is almost exclusively console based over the last ten years, as I've haven't had a computer that was good enough to play the games I'd be interested in since I was a child. As a writer, a lot of the games I love are based on story and the characters held within. My favorite video games of all time are:

* Bioshock
* Borderlands
* Portal
* Dragon's Age
* Commander Keen
* Kid Chamelon
* You Don't Know Jack
* Mass Effect
* The Elder Scrolls
* Fallout

The people I look up to most, other than ones in my every day life, are:

* Conan O'Brien
* Michael J. Fox
* Kevin Smith
* Louis C.K.

They are all incredible men who have more or less mastered their medium and who get paid to do what they love. They also go out of their way to do great things for people without a thought. It's my dream to have that freedom sometime before I die.

My dream is to eventually be a creative writer in some capacity working in film, television or gaming. I love entertaining people, and have been doing so my entire life. I have a completely healthy obsession with Nicolas Cage and like cats more than I like most people, despite my being allergic to them (cats, not people, I think). I'm doing Weight Watchers in an attempt to lose all my extra weight (I have a debilitating anxiety/stress disorder that is now as under control as it will ever be, but prior to being diagnosed whenever I'd have an attack I would stress eat and got huge). I'm already down roughly thirty pounds, but I have much work left to do.

If you want to contact me, please do. Maybe we can be friends on Xbox Live (I'm playing The Cave, Guardians of Middle-earth and FTL at the moment) or you can send me gifts and candy that hopefully isn't poisoned when my birthday occurs in November. Either way, it's a win/win situation for me.",,False,,t5_2sdpe,1359002512.0,,,True,t3_108nm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/108nm2/m4f_nerdsintrovertswomen_who_use_sarcasm_as_a/,

I don't have a whole lot of people to hang out with lately, so I'm looking to find someone who would be interested in just occasional chatting, up to catching a movie, meeting up to watch TV, go bowling, get lunch/dinner or what-have-you.

Yeah, I am a geek. My interests include movies, TV, music (all types), books-- I'm also a fairly avid gamer (if the title was not sufficient enough of a clue.) Lately I am into Magic: The Gathering again after a long hiatus, Guild Wars 2, and very much looking forward to playing Borderlands 2. If you share any of these interests, or are into other games-- SWEET, we should totally play together.

As far as my background, I'm pretty white, but I'm actually Colombian -- I speak semi-fluent Spanish (out of practice). I'm also an Aries and long walks on the beach are cool enough, I guess.

My general interest in women is as follows: I like a well-spoken, intellectual girl who shares some of my interests and isn't quick to judge when it comes to others. ""Geeky"" girls are among my favorite -- high maintenance is a turn off. Open-mindedness and sense of humor rank high on my list of turn-ons.

If you want to talk more, send me a message. I'm paticularlly fond of the ""Question Game"" where we trade questions and answers of varying degrees of interest and curiosity -- from ""what's your favorite Ice Cream flavor"" to ""most embarrassing sexual experience"" so if that's something you would like to play, let me know!

Also-- willing to provide a picture upon request, preferably if you have one to offer.

Unfortunately for me, I work in a female-dominated field, and, while I enjoy my friends and social life greatly, I don't meet many new guys that way.


So, to start, I've lived in Minnesota most of my life, and am hoping to find someone around here. I work in healthcare, and in my spare time, I'm all about reading, tv shows (Joss Whedon anything, Community, just finished The Walking Dead, Dexter, etc), cooking and baking, knitting, and making giant bubbles. In addition, I enjoy ""hanging out"" and ""internetting"". I should say, I'm not big on the Ent life. I love to travel, and am SUPER glad that my new job provides both the money and the time for a bit more of that!


I love good conversation, dry senses of humor, lame puns, and general creativity. I'm an INTJ, if that's interesting to you!


Physically, I'm tall for a girl, about 5'8"", brown hair, green eyes, and fat. If this is a dealbreaker for you, I quite understand, no need to contact me! Other people being heavy is not a dealbreaker for me, so long as one is in shape enough for a bike ride or a romp in a field.

I am 5'11 and a slender man. I have blue eyes and brown hair.

I currently work for a website as an administrator/moderator. I enjoy this type of work on the computer as it allows me to be as flexible with my schedule which can be a hassle sometimes when you are in college. 

I enjoy many things. But most basically I am a huge nerd. I do enjoy video games where to my favorites are, Kingdom Hearts, Star Craft, Tales of Series, Persona series, .Hack, and Guilty Gear. I am also a comic book nerd to where I know what is going on and has been going on in both the DC and Marvel universes. I am a Whovian through and through. I do also enjoy watching anime and reading manga. I have a lot of things that I will go nerd and geek over. And I do have a true fascination with the sciences and certain types of literature. In fact almost every sub type of nerd I can technically apply to based on the way I talk about it and the knowledge I have about it. But look at me rambling on about this. You can ask any further questions on these at anytime.

I enjoy just talking with people and learning about them. I like to explore new places and learn new things. So I am open for most anything. I can also talk about just anything. I tend to be shy sometimes, but once you get to know me I break out of my shell pretty fast. I can sometimes be described as the awkward but lovable nerd and honestly I think that is rather accurate. I have also been described as a silly person because of the things I like can lead me to do or say things that tend to be adorably silly and my friends find that to be a great part of my personality.

Here are some things that I enjoy doing. I enjoy doing the basic stuff like, dinner and a movie because I am a hopeless romantic. We could explore the abandoned locations littered throughout the city. Go to the various events around the city that happen all year. Just stay home and watch some movies or TV, and maybe play some video games. Go to a nice coffee shop and just sit and talk for hours. Wander around the city and look at all the places and enjoy the silly things. Go to parks and walk. Meet each other’s friends and have a fun time with them.

I do like to keep myself well maintained. I am well dressed, artistic, and very well spoken. I tend to be on the gentlemanly side. 

I do have a very unique sense of humor and I so do my friends. And this is something that could honestly be a deal breaker for some of you ladies because my humor could be too much for you.

I am looking for a girl who enjoys the nerdy things I enjoy but still has things that she can call her own. I am also looking for someone who I can have deep conversations with and enjoy my time with together, whether it be just sitting and doing nothing or taking over the world. Age is not an issue. As long as you are a good person and have a good head on your shoulders. 

If you are interested, feel more than welcome to send me a message about yourself and maybe we can see what goes from there.

Thank you for your time and have a great day. =D

I'm the guy who doesn't really see the world and people the way others do. I have multiple perspectives that makes things easier to understand but harder to chose. I'm not shy, I'm not awkward, and I'm not a douchebag (save for a few pranks or moments). I'm spontaneous, if a friend of mine needs me then I'll drive or fly to see them, no questions asked. I'll be selfless to a certain point in order to help someone who's willing to help themselves. I judge others at times but I'm always polite and friendly to them. I'll usually tell you how I see things and the way they are, I don't sugarcoat things either like some people do. I don't lie, or at least I'm very conscious of it so I tend not to by catching myself and I feel bad and correct it. I see good in everyone, I see potential or opportunity in everything, and I'm just a general life enthusiast.

Nearly every single girl I've talked to, since I've known how to talk, has immediately entered the friend zone. If not, then she's either lingering in limbo because of a lack of communication (distance) or because we don't hang out enough (various factors).

I'm looking for four or five people to join me in an experiment. The idea is that we’d be paired with up to six mentors from /r/datingadvice, /r/psychology, or some similar subreddit and, over time, helped to change both the belief system and set of corresponding actions that I believe keeps us alone.

This is a group mentoring project because I think groups are invaluable when trying to overcome challenges like this. Groups have deeper wisdom and often come up with better decisions than an individual would alone. Groups can also be much more motivating; not least because if you promise a group you’re going to do something it’s much more likely you’ll do it.

Once we’ve described ourselves and what we’re looking for we’ll be paired with our mentors. They’ll want to know more about us, particularly about the things that have gone wrong in the past or what we think is holding us back. It’s very important to be honest here, the more open we can be about our perceived failings the more we can be helped. 

Once the background work has been done, our mentors will work with us to set deadline-driven, challenging (but achievable), measurable steps to take towards our goal. The deadline helps us focus. The challenging but achievable steps develops our sense of self-determination. The measurable nature helps us understand we’re making progress. 

This is an action-orientated project, but our since actions are shaped so significantly by our belief system it’s vital we deal with that too. Therefore, the mentors will help us reinterpret whatever it is we’ve told ourselves about why we’ve failed so far, in order we understand that what went wrong is not due to something permanent and unchangeable about us or our luck. This will be an ongoing process because it’s likely we’ll encounter bumps along the way and we’ll need to be careful not to be catastrophic about them too.

We’ll need to be honest, we’ll need to do things we find difficult and we’ll need to commit to the process. If we do that I think we’ll be successful. Anyone else want to see if I’m right?

 - Be shaved and showered.
 - Have a smaller than average penis, preferably thin.
 - I would prefer if you are a short guy but whatever.  
 - You will have to host but if you live in the ghetto, we can try to work something out.

I guess that's about it.  If this isn't a completely terrible experience it could be a semiregular thing.

Interests include: 
A wide variety of music, currently japanese post-rock/instrumental/ambient/electronic.  Toe, Akira Kosemura, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Ametsub, AUS, to list a few. 

Film/photography.  Always down for a good movie; next in queue is Tree of Life.  Debating the attributes to success for modern day photogs, ie Terry Richardson.  Finding niche places around the city for neat photo spots.

Tech and Science.  How long until teleportation and food-in-pill form is viable.  Implications of faster-than-light technology.  Fate of life and the universe, etc etc.

Games.  Anything - puzzles, strategy.. I'm competitive and probably won't give up until I've figured it out and won at least once.

Anime/manga, a given but I promise I'm not a closet weeaboo, though I'm not gonna lie,  I gravitate towards most things Japanese (sushi especially).

I am a CS major in college. My college is online but my roots where I am (Huntsville Texas) are currently pretty deep. My mother has MS and I want to be here as the progression might get worse before it gets ""better"". I am not a mothers boy just not an asshole.

I have tattoos so if that is a problem then you know, whatever. They are really nerdy tattoos ranging from my original art work to ""intra maius qua extra"" or ""Bigger on the inside"" (What up who fans). I also have some Zelda, Pac-Man and Douglas Adams shit going on so it’s like I paid someone to stab me over and over with nerdy. 

I am smart. Not like hey guys I know how to do trig smart (I do) but just smart. I strive on knowledge. I want to learn it all. If I could just stay in college forever getting degree after degree learning and learning I would, but since I can't I am taking programming classes in an attempt to get my ass into a game development position. Luckily I have some friends that work for EA sports that said I pretty much have a job if I wanted it (though I don't really want it cause I'd be doing like nothing but madden for the next 30 years).

I watch TV. I like all the shows people say they like like firefly or dead like me. I also like some shows that aren't cancelled like Suits, Doctor Who, Torchwood, Blue Collar, Fairly Legal and True Blood (don't hate).

I could write for hours and hours about myself but that really seems boring and a little self centered. I don't hate myself. I know I am a bigger person and I don't really care if people don't like that. I might decide one day that I want to lose some weight, who knows, I might not. Fuck it.

Anyways that is so much random shit so just leave a message or PM me or something if you have any interest in me. I would prefer someone who isn't just looking for friends but you know whatever is whatever. Its five AM so I will edit this for typos when I wake up.

Caio.

I've got OKcupid going, but it seems to be a little dull over there. So, I figured I'd try again on Reddit.

I work nights, but my days are usually free.  Weekends tend to be open as well.  The usual plan for weekends now is hang with a small group of friends and play board games.  Recently got into 7 Wonders and Dominant Species.  Though, Dominion and Race for the Galaxy are usually also in rotation.

I'm 6'4, about 180 lbs, and currently trying to get active again (looking into nabbing a decent pair of running shoes and eventually getting a bike).  So, I'd like to find someone who would be willing to not only run/bike/hike/insert physical activity here along side with me, but also wouldn't mind hanging out and nerding it up with some board gaming (or gaming in general).

As for music?  I'm a big fan of 88.1 KDHX, and it's usually the only station I listen to anymore, although I'll switch to 103.3 if nothing interesting is on 88.1.  I don't watch much of modern television.  I do, however, have the entire series of MST3K on my hard drive that gets active views.

As for what I'm looking for?  To be honest, I am looking for a relationship.  But, I don't like just jumping in without testing the water.  I would like to start off with a couple drink and/or quick bite dates to kind of gauge how we click (if at all).

Hope I piqued your interest.  If I did, drop me a line and feel free to ask me about anything else that you'd might like to know about.

I'm a marine biologist who doesn't get near enough work. I love being outdoors and camping, but I don't get to do it often enough for lack of people to do it with. I love music and will see live shows any chance I get. I'm also pretty eclectic in my tastes so as long as they are good at whatever genre they are, I'll probably enjoy them. Except Top 40, hate top 40's music...mostly. I also severely enjoy dancing like an idiot but I'm really shy about doing it in public. 

I play video games and consider myself pretty good at them but my best friend is way better. I like to keep current on world events, domestic news, happenings around town, and even neighborly gossip. I cook like a mofo, though it shows in the fact that I'm a bit overweight. I love to BBQ, fry, sautee, slow cook, and pretty much any other way to turn raw materials into delicious dinner for everyone. 

I'm a pretty sensual person and love experiencing new things. I like long walks on a beautiful day. I'm happiest when I'm listening to good music while on a long drive to either somewhere or nowhere. 

A list of my favorites:

Music Artist: Ratatat

Album: Moon Safari by AIR

Beer: Magic Hat #9

Videogame: Fallout New Vegas

Book: Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut

Author: Douglas Adams

Movie: Mortal Kombat (I only picked this cause I like way too many movies and this is the one I've seen the most)

Color: Blue (though I am starting to like green a whole lot more)

T-shirt: My Peelander-Z mad tiger t-shirt

Superhero: The Hulk

I have a broken filter. I don't hold back. If you ask me something I will answer it honestly. Probably too honestly. 

I like meeting people on the internet. A lot of the people I meet in person fall in to the same category. Folks met through mutual friends have typically the same vibe. The internet lets me branch out and meet all different types of people, which I love.

I can talk to anyone about music. I like a very wide range of genres. If you think I don't know it, introduce me to it.

I am one of those tiny girls who can eat a 300 lb man under the table. I love eating and food in general.

People who drink to get drunk make me uncomfortable.

There are a ton of movies I haven't seen. I'm trying to work my way through the classics and staples.

I don't discriminate when it comes to age, but I will say that I tend to gravitate towards older men and men my age.. but maybe that's just been coincidence.

I laugh often. Corny jokes are great. I love wit. People with a dark or dry sense of humor hold a special place in my heart.

I'm really looking for somebody that I can really connect with. I'm an introverted person in general, but I love having deep one-on-one connections with people. I'm an INTP if you are familiar with what that is.
My interests tend to revolve around things that don't require going out in group settings. With that said I'm not a drinker at all. I like video games, music, TV shows, internet, technology, astronomy, fishing, and trying new things. I'm probably one of the most open minded persons you could ever meet.

I'm okay with talking to somebody either far away or local. I just want somebody who can understand me. I know that sounds cliche, but I truly do feel alone in this world.

I'm there I'm 25 yrs old dude from southern California. I'm from an area called thousand oaks. It's part of ventura county and odds are you haven't heard of it at all.

As the title suggest I am a dream type of person. Ive spent quite a bit of my life with my head in the clouds or between a good book. Because of these things I've become quite socially awkward and don't know really how to talk to people unless they are too totally weird and out there. People who know me always find it weird when I say I'm a shy dude since I'm talkative and tend to go on but I am shy at the start. Even more so when I'm starting to get to know someone of the opposite sex

Right now my life is kinda not where I want it to be. I'm working a shit job while trying to figure out if I should go back to school and finish up my psych degree or maybe just start fresh again. I enjoy going out and having a good time. Whether its hiking, driving around or just spending it at home. I like to game and my current obsessions have been TF2 and minecraft but I love classic games like earthbound, chrono trigger, anacrhonox and the fallout series. Books right now don't really consist of much since I have a huge back log of books that Ive bought read half way and haven't finished. They mostly consist of fiction scifi and fantasy. Music Is also somewhere I tend to lag but I love all types except country. If you're like and worship the ground the bowie walks on I will love you forevers.

As for what im looking for? I'm looking for someone to start out with friends and then if there is something there, we move onto something relationship wise? Idk. Im very bad at the whole dating game and been single for quite sometime. I want someone who's as nerdy as me, bubbly personality would be a major plus cuz that rubs off on me and is weird. Someone who doesn't really feel like they fit in out there. I'm not perfect , never will but but I'm me. Be open minded, enjoy the humor that life has to bring and lets rock and roll?

At the age of 19, after two years of reading and intense study, I built myself the necessary equipment to become a blacksmith, and am still embroiled in the fires of my forge daily. I make knives as a specialty, and no mass-produced knife can compare to one of mine. 

Things I like: 
Homestuck, Netflix, reading, intelligent conversation, political discussions, disrupting taboos, zombie video games, researching new forging techniques, shooting guns, throwing tomahawks, stand-up comedy, and practicing/developing martial arts techniques. 

Things I can do:
Build a forge, use it to forge an axe, hang it on a hickory stave, and chop a tree down with it, all before nightfall. I can train a dog, shoot a 12-gauge with one hand, survive in the wilderness for 9 days [done it before, at 14], pull off high-heels for Rocky Horror, fix just about anything, and cook a delicious meal.

What I'm looking for:
Any girl with a good sense of humor and good lick of intelligence. I find that the two go hand-in-hand with one another. Skype is a must. Physical attractiveness certainly is a plus, but I'm not particularly picky. Good personal hygiene is pretty necessary, but that's all I really ask in the physical department. 

What I don't like: Bridezillas. Seriously. If you're specially entitled, overly dramatic (Beyond the realm of humor,) clingy, overly prudish, in favor of total civilian disarmament, or just plain stupid, I want nothing to do with you.

I am 5'9, 135 pounds, dirty blonde hair of nerd... stuff that enjoys weird nerd things like Pokemon, games, computers, and other strange things that obviously keep me from functioning like a normal human being. Nice huh!?

I enjoy many different types of music, and as long as it's got a good beat (and isn't country, I blame this state for my hatred of that music)  chances are I will listen to it and enjoy it. 

I'm currently in school going for my Associates in Computer Science, and other then that not doing much else worth mentioning, besides being ""Forever Alone"", but that is a given.

To sum this up:

• Does this post interest you? 

• Are you 19-22 years old?
 
• Are you somewhere within the US, or possibly Canada?

• Are you just as lonely as I am?
 
• Do you have Skype or some other form of communication where we can talk about stupid things no one but us will understand? 

Well shit, that's just dandy. Shoot me a PM or something, if you include a picture, I will send one back :), although chances are it will be terrible.

Just a ending note: Long distance relationships don't bother me, I live in a state pretty devoid of people that are interested in me (why else would I be here), so chances are you will not live here, but if you do, that would be hilarious, and amazing

My best friend is my 65 year old step-father, which in itself is not something I'm ashamedl to say, but I need to have people in my age range :).

I love reading science fiction and fantasy books (what geek doesn't!) and can watch any associated films with equal enthusiasm. I've recently found i'm starting to enjoy comics, something I never got to have as a kid. I'm equal parts Star Wars nerd and Trekkie, there is room in my life for both. I'm also an off and on PC gamer, when the mood strikes.

But wait! There is more! I cook, and enjoy it very much. With the exception of the really out-there dishes, i always like trying to make a new recipe and try food prepared different ways. I enjoy listening to music, and hope that someday I might even get to learn how to play guitar. I'm currently on a loop of listening to The Fratellis and Ok Go. I don't know what it is about their music, but i love it! I'm a dog person, though not much for cats.

I can be shy at first, but I'm genuinly friendly and open up quickly. I have a sarcastic and witty sense of humor, with the occasional bad pun tossed in. I'm not much a partying/clubbing type but I enjoy going out if it is the right activity.

This post is on hold for now - I might not be FA after all.  :)

Hello gentlemen, (and ladies if you're looking for a friend) - I don't know if it's the area I live in but CF people are difficult to find and since the CF4CF sub is pretty slow I thought I'd try here. I'm currently in the WV Eastern Panhandle/Western Maryland area - think Martinsburg/Hagerstown, but anywhere in a one or two hour drive works for me.

I like to think that I'm well rounded when it comes to a hobbies - playing video games, horseback riding, reading (I collect graphic novels and own hundreds of books), gardening and working outdoors are a few of the major ones right now. Other things I like to do would be hiking, watching the occasional movie or TV show (Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and The Mindy Project are some of the few I'll watch), biking, the arts, music and live shows, camping, and antiquing. I can operate a chainsaw, change the oil in your car, AND throw you a piece of pottery if you want!

Things I don't like? Politics, bigots and sports except for hockey, which I can kind of watch. And MMA/UFC, those are fun to watch as well.

Currently I am unemployed; I worked in the aerospace industry and was laid off a few months ago. Since then, I spend most of my time looking for work or doing one of the above mentioned. I'm also planning on heading back to college this summer, so I'll be a full-time student again soon and will probably just work a crap job while I'm in school unless something awesome comes along.

In the interests of honesty - I'm not in the best shape ever but I'm not obese - I'm working on losing weight by exercising, taking care of and riding my horse, and learning to cook and eat healthy tasty food. So if you like to eat healthy tasty food, that's a bonus. :)

I'm looking for friends as much as I am a relationship, so drop me a line either way!  I have pictures available if you're interested. 

Oh and lastly, I figure I should mention a few things about what I'm looking for since I don't have an OKC profile for anyone to look at yet.  I'm not extraordinarily picky but from experience there are a couple of things that are must-haves for a relationship.  You should absolutely, positively be 100% childfree.  This is a big one.  I don't want kids, I don't like them really, I don't want to take care of your kids.  You must be an animal-lover, as I have a cat, a dog, and a horse and will always own animals. Please be clean. I don't care if you're an untidy person, as I am myself, but I keep things clean and can't stand straight up filth. This applies to both your living space and your person. (Again, sadly, this is from experience.) Lastly, be open to learning and trying new things and I'll return the favor. :)

I'm making this post because I am tired of being alone. I don't want to get too much into the details in a post everybody could read, but here's my 'dating life' so far.

I am 19 years old, I've never had a girlfriend, unless you count the 1 year long relationship I was in from when I was 11 till when I was 12 with a girl in my school. Over the years I've managed to build up the courage to ask a few girls out on a date, about 3 or 4, I can't remember, all rejected me. I'm tired of it, besides the fact that I've never gotten anywhere near a date with these girls, I still feel heartbroken whenever it happens.

So a bit about me; I love video games, I'm doing a study in gamedesign at the moment, I also enjoy a lot of TV series (Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, etc.), I don't really have any hobbies besides playing video games/making video games/watching series. I mess around a little on my electronic piano every once in a while too. Oh also, movies. I like going to the cinema with friends.

I am fat. I am working on it, but it's hard. I'm no Jabba, but I am nowhere near fit either. I won't post a photo here (in fear it might be found by my friends), but if you really want to see my face you can ask and I'll PM you something.

As for what I am looking for, basically any female that's into some of the stuff I am into, liking videogames is a huge +, as I am pursuing a career in that area, however, if you don't then that's ok.

I have no idea if this will ever be read, or if there actually are any Dutch people in /r/ForeverAloneDating, but I thought I'd give it a shot.

Also, you may have noticed by now that I'm Asian. I'm mostly attracted to white guys because of my height.

About you: Please be funny too (naturally funny, sir. But if you are good at faking humour, I'll accept that), polite, non-pervert, good-looking, tall, witty, clingy and genetically, has the XY chromosome.

Well, other than being funny, it'd be great if you can sometimes be serious too and listen to me whine about my **disastrous** life and how the world is **always** against me.

So, PM me if you're all that and please include a pic? :)

Looking for the 'mate' to my 'soul'.,9,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/199oof/24_m4f_anywhere_looking_for_the_mate_to_my_soul/,"I would have gone with 'the Juliet to my Romeo', but we all know how that story ended, don't we? And I'm a little too young to be going and killing myself in a crypt over a young girl, anyway.

So, a little about me! My name's Dave, I'm 24, and I'm from the UK. England.

One of my favourite quotes is by Tolstoy, and goes as follows: 'If you want to be happy, be'. This is a philosophy I try to live my life by.

I'm a pretty big guy (I could never be called slim, unless by someone being cruelly ironic), and I wear glasses. Think of me as a 6'0 teddy bear with specs, and you're probably about there.

I can't sleep unless I'm in total darkness, with complete silence.

I have a love of exploring new places and learning new things all the time. I'm very open to trying new foods and learning lots of things about a person. I also enjoy basic hiking and scenic walks, so long as they're taken slowly, because why rush through life? It's there for the living, so why not do so?
I have a continuously expanding list of things I like to do; not so much a bucket list, as a 'okay, I'm bored, let's find something to do', list.

I love to read, and often set aside hours of time to just sit and do it. If I'm alone, I'll curl up with a good book, some smooth jazz, and read. If I'm reading around other people- friends, family, strangers who don't know what they're getting into- I'll show them passages I like, or read out bits in various accents that may or may be completely wrong for the character. I have a huge collection of books, and particularly enjoy mysteries, thrillers, detective novels, and parodies.

I like a lot of movies, but again, I particularly enjoy mysteries, thrillers, detective movies, and comedies. I love anything by Mel Brooks- bonus points if it includes Gene Wilder, too.

Musically, I like jazz, blues, swing, classic rock and pop. Anything from before the mid-nineties, for the most part, though sometimes ill listen to something more recent if I can kind of persuade myself to.

What am I looking for? Ideally, someone a little- or a lot- like me. Distance isn't an issue, nor is age- just be on Earth, and 18 or over, and we'll be just fine. I'm cool with whatever, though I would, ultimately, be looking at a relationship, whether long distance or otherwise.
I do have a pic available, but it's the worst one ever, because it's me in the world's most hideous shirt, holding a barn owl.

I'm an atheist, if that matters to you, but I have no problem being friends with or dating theists; it's a topic I just love discussing, with anyone.

I'm definitely more of an introvert, but before you stop reading, let me explain precisely what I mean by that. I'm not shy, I just prefer interaction in small groups as opposed to large ones, and definitely prefer to spend the majority of my time alone or with only a few people.

So I'm just putting this in here because if you want someone to go to clubs/concerts/bars with on a regular basis, I'm not the guy. But if you want someone to take you on walks in Forest Park, or watch movies at home under several blankets, or talk for hours one on one, I'm your guy.

I'm athletic and outdoorsy, enjoy running and walking, and used to do a lot of camping, hiking, and rock climbing, although I hardly have at all since I've been in St. Louis, thanks to law school unfortunately. But if you're into any of that maybe you'd help get me back into gear, and if not it's all good.

Other than that I love discussing philosophy and politics (I'm in law school, remember) and science, and the future, and movies, and anything really. I'm not sure if there's anything I love more than cuddling up and watching a bizarre/strange/interesting movie, and kicking around our interpretations and theories afterwards.

I do a fair amount of computer gaming, particularly with my roommate (Civ 5, Minecraft, LoL, etc). I'm not posting here to find gaming buddies, but it never hurts to mention it. If it's a common interest or you're just looking for someone to play these games or others with, let me know.

I'm posting here because I am looking for new friendships. I have social anxiety and am very socially awkward, so I do not have many friends and I'm not too lucky with forming relationships. I have a great sense of humor, and I've been told I'm a very sweet and nice guy. I would love to make some new friends on here, someone to talk to and see how their day went. I am also a new redditor, so I need someone to show me the ways.

My name is Jessie, and as you know from the title, I live in Montana, and have been here all my life. I spend a great deal of my time playing video games online. I will pretty much play any game except sports games. I'm not a big sports type of guy. I love to play RPG's, free roaming games, shooters, and adventure games, but will play almost anything. I mainly play console games with a few PC games such as; WoW, GW2, COD 1, Etc...

I don't read that often, but when I do they are mostly Horror, mostly Steven King. As for movies, I like Action, Adventure, SciFi, and Fantasy movies. But will watch pretty much anything. My favorite has to be the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

I'm very fond of music. I like pretty much metal in general, like heavy metal, death metal, thrash metal, black metal, etc.. A couple of my favorite bands are TOOL and Iron Maiden.

I am not currently attending anything, though I plan on starting in the fall for Network Administration. In my spare time I enjoy listening to and finding new bands to listen to, also playing games and going out with friends. Anyway, if any of this has caught your interest, please feel free to send a message.

I work in retail and I'm going back to school this semester for library science.
I enjoy video games, both the classics and new games. 
My Ipod is filled with either stuff you hear on CD1025 (alt rock/indie) or  game soundtracks. 
I love long walks. I live close to Highbanks so I end up going there often.
I'm agnostic, and somewhat liberal, but I'll always listen to someone's opinion.

Hello. I've never done this before, but I'll try my best. I'm 22 (senior in college). I'm not socially awkward or ""weird"" (I think?). I like video games, but I'm not super into them like most FA people I've seen (I play League here and there, and typical stuff on xbox like Assassin's Creed, cod, halo, sports games, etc.). Actually, I wouldn't really consider myself a FA, but this whole thing seems very interesting to me! I'm not a commitment-phobe. I've dated 5 women in my day (time spanning from HS to now in college) with the longest relationship being 2 year. 

I have a solid number of amazing friends, but they drink every weekend. while this is fun, I've found myself recently gravitating towards staying in and watching movies/ boxed wine nights with close friends. I am naturally skinny, but I work out quite often (except during finals/exam weeks!) in an attempt to beat my skinny-person genetics. I'm 5'10"" ish.

I will tease you a lot, and I enjoy being fucked around with in return (not a sexual pun, you perverts!). I will never randomly throw cake in your face, but I would laugh my ass off if you did this to me.

I cannot play instruments or sing (though these are qualities I find extremely sexy in women).

Though I can fend for myself, I can't cook super well (but i'm very good at doing dishes, like, REALLY FUCKING GOOD. I'm talking 8.5/10 on the dish washing scale, 10/10 when I use a dishwasher).

I don't think I'm unattractive, but that's not my judgement to make considering I only spend a whole 5 minutes looking at myself in the fogged up mirror after my showers. If you're interested, PM me!

4. Hiking/camping: Once again, sort of cold for it now, but definitely doable!

5. City exploration! There's no way you've been to every part of the city! It's so damn expansive (and expensive, lol!)

First of all, pardon the formatting, I'm new to this and eventually just said, ""Forget it!""

I’m a 22 year old from the SW Burbs, and I’m looking for true love and romance. I’m currently employed and go to school. My hope is to be a high school physics teacher within the next couple of years. That being said, I am kind of a nerd(some kids dreamed of being rock stars, I dreamed of being a paleontologist), but not to the point that it’s how I’d be labeled. I’m probably one of the more unique individuals you will ever meet. I don’t have a religion or a god, but I respect you and yours and believe in, above most other things, the power of love in this world. As my favorite band said, “All you need is love, love is all you need.” The only thing I believe in more than love is honesty. You don’t know me, but no matter what, I will never lie to you. 

In a relationship, I’m very much the cuddler. I love holding hands, holding my significant other tight, and giving lots of random kisses. One of my favorite things to do is curl up on the couch with my sig other to watch a good movie and have her fall asleep in my arms. There’s nothing quite like the warmth of another. One of the things I’ve always wanted to do is curl up under a blanket outside and watch the stars through the night and talk until the sun comes up in the morning.


I love music and I love movies. Those are probably my two favorite art forms. I listen to all sorts of music and play some guitar. I love comedies, dramas, sci-fi, and fantasy movies, among others. Here's some of my favorites.

Bands:

* The Beatles
* CCR
* Jimi Hendrix Experience
* Why?
* Cloud Cult
* Frank Zappa
* Thelonious Monk
* Charles Mingus
* The Rolling Stones
* City &amp; Colour
* Alexisonfire
* The Black Dahlia Murder
* Danny Elfman
 
Movies:
* Jurassic Park
* Big Fish
* Stars War(Eps. IV-VI)
* Life is Beautiful
* Forest Gump
* Back to the Future
* Tommy Boy
* Pulp Fiction
* Rocky
* Joe Dirt
* Ted
* O’ Brother, Where Art Thou?
* Saving Private Ryan


Bonus points for you if:
* You don’t mind facial hair
* You are 18-24 years old
* You like going out as much as you like staying in, and vice versa
* You can enjoy yourself a good burger aren’t always hung up about your diet
* You like to talk and have long conversations
* You can enjoy drinking without having to get drunk
* You don’t mind the smell of cigars
* You enjoy science and are geeky/nerdy
* You love animals
* You have a smile and a set of eyes that will leave me stupefied &lt;--My weakness
* You curse and don't mind others doing so! Fuck yes!

POW- I'm an award-winning poet. Ask for more details.  
CLANK- I'm an unofficial award-winning actor (Best Scream in A Play)  
KA-POW- I can play various instruments, including the harmonica, and like music like jazz, swing, blues, classic rock, etc.  
ZAM- I love to act, and I especially like accents. Once pretended to be Irish for an entire relationship. Long story. Ask for details.  
WHAP- I'm a photography fiend. I'm never without my camera, even on a trip to the shops.  
GLIP- I once tried to train a squirrel when I was little. Didn't work out too well.  
BLURP-When I'm in the car, I like to pretend there's a laser beam firing out the side, cutting everything down a certain height. Unfortunately, there are casualties.  
BIFF- I used to imagine that there was a second me, twelve hours behind the current me, so he'd be doing whatever I'd done.  
POWIE- If I get a song stuck in my head, I'll sing it out really loud, until it's gone. This is frowned upon in most social situations, and there's a few libraries I'm not allowed into ever again.  
CRRRRACK- Whenever I make a decision, I'll bang my fist on the table, and say 'that's settled then!' in a loud and decisive voice. This has also led to me being banned from several libraries.  
QUNCKK- If I find a band I like, even just one song of theirs, I'll find an album- preferably a 'Greatest Hits' one- and listen to it over and over until I'm bored of them.  
KER-SPLOOSH-I have insane luck with tombolas. Every time I play one, I win at least two items. Even if I only bought one ticket.  
THWACK-I love to cook, and experiment, and luckily, some recipes work out. Others? Not so much.
ZAM-I like to read fantasy, sci-fi, thrillers, chillers, hardboiled stuff, and a little of everything else.  
ZGRUPP-Movie-wise, I like all sorts, but I do like film noire, comedies, action movies, thrillers, and rom coms in particular, though.  
VRONK-I'm pretty heavily into videogames; I own a 360, a few of the older Nintendo consoles, a PS2, and a Sega Mega Drive.

That's all, folks. Remember to pack your Bat-Shark Repellant in your Bat-Belt, and I'll see you next time.

Let's help each other out.,10,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/13i5zj/22_m4f_indiana_eastern_being_lonely_sucks_lets/,"Trying to find new friends/relationships is just *awful*! I've tried OkCupid, r4r, and even PlentyofFish (an awful decision), but it seems like I can never find someone I can ""click"" with, y'know? I'm not a complete recluse, but I live in a tiny redneck town with one traffic light, so it's hard to meet anyone in person. 

I like to think I'm a pretty awesome guy. I'm polite, intelligent, easy-going, and deeply passionate about the things I like, such as science, art, music, TV/movies, and gaming. My sense of humor is pretty easily described as ""ridiculous"", but I like to think there's no fun in taking everything seriously. 

I'm also incredibly bad at summarizing myself without writing an essay, so here's a list of things I like instead:

* **Gaming:** WoW, Diablo, Starcraft, LoL, Minecraft, Smash Bros., Pokemon, Halo, Zelda, Mario, Megaman

*  **Music:** Coheed and Cambria (definitely my favorite!), Deadmau5, The Offspring, Foo Fighters, Ronald Jenkees, Massive Attack, The Mars Volta, Radiohead - Mostly rock and electronic.

* **Other stuff I like:** Breaking Bad, Dexter, The Walking Dead, programming, cooking, painting, graphic design, SCIENCE

Anyway, I'm looking for someone with similar interests. Obviously, it'd be great if you live near eastern Indiana, but I'm not picky about distance if you're cool. As far as looks go, I'm not picky! I'd very much prefer if you were thin, ""average"", or curvy, however. Not required, but bonus points for: bright eyes, dark hair, pale skin, glasses, crude sense of humor, open-mindedness.

Thanks for taking the time to check this out. Hope you have a great day!

I overanalyze to the point that it is easier simply to give up, so hopefully someone overzealous and forthright can coax me out of my shell, although at this point such hopes no longer exist.  I'm not an interesting person, and I certainly wouldn't say I'm a nice person or a bad person for that matter.  Mostly I'm a moody grump.  The past decade I've spent reading.

I am 24 years old, kinda stocky (might be my really nice way of describing my own chubby-ness, but there is muscle there), and I work at an elementary school as a reading specialist.

I come from a small town in the Eastern Shore part of Maryland. I never felt like I fit in here, mostly because I enjoy things that aren't related to being a giant redneck. 

I really enjoyed going to college because it gave me a chance to meet new people and experience new things, but now that I've come back home, things aren't the same. I'm hoping to eventually meet someone who shares the same interests as me and challenges me as a person.

My interests vary greatly; I enjoy being outdoors (camping, fishing, archery, target shooting, hiking) , but I also enjoy going to museums and seeing shows at the theater. My favorite type of music is ska music, but I also have a fondness for jazz and random pop songs (like Call Me Maybe). I am also very big into acting; I spent four years in college as a part of an improv comedy troupe and I loved every minute of it.

Might as well give it a shot...",11,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/11vo4q/22m4atexasdallasmesquite_area_might_as_well_give/,"Haven't had a whole lot of luck with a bevy of dating sites (PoF! OKCupid! *fist shake*) and honestly I don't really expect a whole lot of luck here, but wahey, I'll try anything once. First and foremost the most important thing about me that I need to get out is... I'm deaf. 100%, completely, both ears, deaf as a doorknob. Couldn't hear a grenade if you set if off next to my head. Lost my hearing at age 5 to a bout of meningitis that was going around the daycare centers at the time, and I spent three days in a coma as a result- all very dramatic, I assure you. A year later at age 6 I was implanted with a cochlear implant in my right ear (more technical information about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant)) and as such I speak very little sign language, though I do know the alphabet and numbers and would be happy to teach them to you. I am 22 years of age now, I have spent my entire life with the thing, and I will be more then happy to answer any questions you have about it- It is not a sensitive subject, you will not offend me if you want to know more about it, I even somewhat enjoy talking about it.

Now that that's out of the way... I am a bit on the hefty side, though I am trying to go to the gym and fix this. As it is, I'm not a very self-motivating person, my motivation is easily ruined, so I don't go as often as I should. If you're wanting a hunk to hang off the arm of, you won't find it in me... yet, anyway. I enjoy reading and gaming, being a very large fan of the Mass Effect and F.E.A.R series, as well as numerous types of anime. (Hey, grown-ups get to watch cartoons too, y'know.) For being deaf, I'm told I can be very patient and understanding, but make your own judgements on that front. On that note, I can speak just fine. Nothing more then your typical southern drawl, I don't have an issue with pronunciation, so no worries about that.  Beyond that, I haven't a clue as to what to put in here. Honestly, I am not a hundred percent sure what I want- A short-term relationship, long-term, friends with benefits, just friends... I've been single for the better part of half a decade and to say I'm somewhat rusty at the dating scene would be like calling the sun 'kind of warm'.
So, let's give this a shot and see what happens, eh? I'm open to both sides of the fence, but I profess to a slight preference for women over men- Nothing personal, and I'm always open to being convinced.

Edit: Huh. Reading it again, I should probably give a little bit more personal information and be a little less vague then that, eh? Let's see. I'm a very physically affectionate person (in that I am a cuddler and hand-holder, and see no problems with spending all day curled up on the couch) and generally a very quiet person except for certain topics that I tend to rant about (Guyver, certain books. Do NOT get me started on certain short stories by Roger Zelazny, you'll never get me to shut up again). I am also, ironically for being deaf, a very good listener- If you have a problem, I always have time to listen to it, if only so you can get it off your chest. I might not be able to say anything to help with it, but it's better then nothing at all. I do not, at the time of this posting, have a job but with any luck that will be solved as I am talking to a few bookstores about openings there, so along with my weight that is in the process of being resolved. I am also very much an animal person, had them all my life and couldn't imagine living without at least a cat. I'm very family oriented, and I'm good with kids, up to a point; having a lot of patience tends to help there, I find.

Things I love:


- Animals (Horses, reptiles, dogs &amp; cats! ... and basically everything else)

- Nature (hiking, fishing, camping, mushroom hunting, you name it.)

- Laughter &lt;3

- Cuddles

- Gaming (I very much enjoy moderate/casual gaming. I'm basically up for anything but I would never consider myself hardcore)

- Watching movies, reading

- Good Conversation 

- Writing &amp; Painting

- Trust (I want to be able to tell you anything)

- Trying new things&amp; conquering my fears (heights, spiders.. leaving messages on someone's voicemail!)

- Calling things cute ..(:

- Dreaming


Obviously that isn't all, I love trying new things and going places and experiencing things! That being said, I'm actually very shy when you first meet me but when I open up I can be pretty good company. At least I'd like to think so! 


Basically, I'm looking for someone who will be genuinely interested in learning about me so I can do the same. Sharing interests is a huge plus (: I would prefer if you were in my age range (23 or less? but it's not a complete cut off or anything.) If I were to describe my dream guy in a few words(or gal..

I am a guy who loves superheroes, video games, and cartoons. Currently I am very much into watching ultimate spiderman, Avengers, and occasionally young justice. However these are not my favorites. My Absolute favorite it Justice League Unlimited mainly because of Kevin Conroy....Man Kevin Conroy does so great things. For video games I play WoW, Swtor, DCUO, and Diablo 3. I have been dragged in LoL but disconnect issues caused me to get banned and I had a bad time. 

I am currently going to college for Film and Video and hope to keep this superhero movie thing going since it's amazing! I also adore the show Entourage and I start my day off with a early morning showing on comedy central; It gets me into the mindset to kick ass in film. Hopefully some of the women on here enjoy films as much as I do, perhaps we can see some together and talk about it afterwords.

I also enjoy a girl who like to be silly and act stupid sarcastically because lets face it stupid people are funny, Youtube proves this to be true. Also I understand we all have stupid moments so being accepting of that would be cool since I have been known to miss signals from people and not know what they want. 

If you feel like you want to hang or maybe grab a coffee or play some WoW together lets do it and own face in BGs or in some raids.....or drink coffee(Spoiler alert I'll be drinking hot chocolate). Here is a pic of me and I hear I am handsome from girls other than my mother! Yes I do believe this is an acheivment.

It's been a while since I tried this. No luck last time, but here I am again. I'm not looking for anything too terribly serious, but I'd like to see where things take us.

Anyway, I consider myself a pretty easy-going guy. I can be a little shy and awkward at first, but once I open up I'm a fairly outgoing and opinionated guy...who is still pretty awkward.

I'm a bit of a homebody, but that doesn't mean that I don't like to get out. It's just that my idea of a nice get-together would be cuddling up and watching a movie, or wrecking your shit at Beautiful Katamari.

I'm looking for someone who is fairly like-minded (more progressive leanings, a bit nerdy, interested in the sciences) it's my experience that people tend to get along better when they don't have wildly different ideologies. Being kind and accepting also goes a long way in my book.

I know it's kind of cliche on reddit, but I'm a bit shy at first, although I'm fantastic to be around once I get started. I have a very Australian sense of humor (dry, a bit silly and usually inappropriate), and I'm willing to give most things a try (I know what I don't like, and the rest is fair game).

I do spend a lot of time in front of a computer - I code for a living and for fun, play video games and browse reddit. I've also been expanding the number of non-computer related activities that I have, like playing board games, dance lessons and (when the weather is nice) walking or driving around Washington. I'd love to explore more, but it's more fun to go out when you have someone with you ;)

I'm always thinking, and I love to learn new things. I'm the sort of guy who will have a podcast playing when gaming, exercising or cooking. I'll code on the weekend for fun and love to tinker with new technology or software. I also enjoy discussions related to code and technology, be it optimal algorithms, favorite languages or the latest smartphone.

What I'm looking for is someone to be with: to explore with, to talk to, to cuddle and who gets me (not asking for much is it...). I'm also hoping for a long term relationship: I'd prefer the comfort and romance of a relationship to the ups and downs of dating.

I'm also fine if someone just wants to chat or go out for a beer.

I'm a 30 year old Chicagoan who lives by Midway Airport. I'm also close to Burbank and Oak Lawn as well as Pilsen. I am working on becoming an official translator/ESL teacher. I have a full-time job at a bookstore and on my free time I enjoy jogging/working out, reading, watching movies, playing video games and catching up with television. I like all sorts of music, from classical, ""oldies,"" indie, punk, soul, garage and lots more. I enjoy going to movies, shows and karaoke. Museums and art exhibits can be fun! I enjoy looking around record stores and seeing what neat albums, movies and occasional games/vhs can be found. 

Regarding the gaming: I enjoy shmups, FPS, fighting games, own a Dreamcast and Xbox 360. I also have gotten back into anime and have watched a few current series. As for films, I love them all. Ranging from action no-brainers, pretentious arthouse films, cult cinema, dumb comedies, dreary dramas, exploitation, grindhouse, horror, independent stuff, foreign films (yay subtitles!) to z-grade trash. There's a lot more to talk about, but if you'd like to know more... feel free to ask.

New account for this. I don't know if there are others out there with similar situations as mine, but I'm hoping there are. At least one. Games in relationships aren't really my thing; I don't enjoy them and am quite terrible at them. It's easy to say all these things about myself, somewhat like I'm standing in a window, showing off good and hiding the bad. Doing that seems silly though. I don't want to false advertise. I am looking for a relationship but I'll need to go slow, it's been a while for me but I'm ready to get back up and try again.

I've recent'y moved to the area, still getting things figured out. I do have a job as a programmer, a car, and my own place if that's important to you. I'm a bit nerdy but more in the software and hardware sense. Girls that are a bit nerdy themselves or don't hate things that aren't 'cool' are pretty awesome in my book. Keeping an open mind is critical. I try to do this myself but am not always the best. I can cook *okay*, and am a pretty clean person. I do my work before I play and leave the best tasting food for last on my plate. I love winter and am a romantic. Coffee is the best addition to snow. Sometimes I worry more than I should; I'm also very sensitive. Having a same team mentality is important to me in a relationship. I'm fit but I don't look like the guys in 300. Being with a girl who takes care of her body is important to me, as I'll do the same myself. However, really skinny girls are a bit creepy sometimes. Three qualities I find to be really attractive in a woman are sincerity, patience, and being true to emotions. I'm pretty terrible at sports, but I do enjoy some outdoor things and have done a lot of distance hiking in the past. Watching sports on tv seems silly to me. I can see why people would like watching it but it's just not my thing, I don't hate on those who do. Different types of art are pretty interesting to me; I tried painting once and it looked like something from a 1st grade class.

I'm by no means perfect, and I'm not looking for a girl who is. I don't really want to someone to *act as* my girlfriend, but rather have her experience her life while I experience my life, just together. If that makes sense. Someone who will let me help her when she needs it, and someone who will help me when I need help.

I understand that I'm not for everybody and that's okay. If this seems silly or too sappy for you that's okay as well, but please don't be rude.

I'm 23 years old, and I'm hoping someone is on the other side of this to say hi.",,False,,t5_2sdpe,False,,,True,t3_n1zjg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/n1zjg/m4f_se_mass_boston_simplicity_in_company/,

If there was a word to describe me, I think it would be: average. I'm about 5' 7"" so I'm not a giant but I'm not short either. I'm a lit major where I go to college and I don't really go out to do much of anything since I'm either stuck at home working papers/essays or spending my time procrastinating. Though I'm trying to change that now. For the few friends that I have, and anyone else that becomes friends with me, I cherish/remain close to those few people and enjoy the few moments of fun that I have with them. Even though I'm kinda shy around people that I don't know, I open up and become more energetic once I get along with them; in truth I'm a pretty crazy/quirky person on the inside with a twisted sense of humor. 

Here's some other things about me:

Favorite Movies:
-Citizen Kane, Evil Dead 1 + 2, Army of Darkness, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, Goodfellas, and a whole lot of other movies that I don't want to digress upon (I'm a bit of a movie person).

Musical Taste(s):
-Essentially anything classic rock, but in particular: Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Johnny Cash, The Doors, etc. 

Favorite Books (Where do I begin...):
-One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Less Than Zero, One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Grapes of Wrath, and a crap load of other novels/books that would take me a while to list.

Current video games I've been playing lately:
-Skyrim (PC), TF2, MW3 (Xbox 360, and if you want to play with me online just ask!)

Flushing, NY 420",8,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/j28zo/m4w_30_seeking_partner_in_crime_flushing_ny_420/,"Hello there, after meeting with a long awaited redditor yesterday, I came to the realization that SHE was way too attractive for the likes of me (not to mention she's already in a relationship), and I am just too god damn CRAZY and just all round not good looking enough.

So, its time once again boys and girls for me to get back to my faithful FA community.

*WARNING* Lots of foul language used

As I mentioned above and in the title, I'm a grown ass man at the age of 30, live in Queens, NY, born in Taiwan but mainly raised here in the US. Am quite archaic, almost to a point where most young-em would call a fucking antique, but crazy enough to keep up muhahaha. 

I work in JFK airport as a salesperson in the Tumi™ store(Union job BABY!), fucking hate it if u ask me, but it gets the bills paid and I get to see lots of beautiful women. After work is usually a blunt or a bowl of the highest grade of hydroponics, if the mood is right I usually dive into a game of LoL or L4D2. On my days off its usually laundry and chilling with my brother and his 4 year old princess, we do sometimes get the family together for a trip to Wal-mart or DSW, depending on whats needed.

Of course the above mentioned activities aren't the ONLY things I do, but it does sum shit up.

So, to recap: 30 year old Asian man, Taiwanese but raised in the US, archaic and motha fucking crazy (not THAT crazy), lives a very routine life, chills indoor almost like a hermit, seeking a female partner in crime to DOMINATE THE WORLD... no, no, just kidding about the world domination part.... unless *you* want to, then I am your man.

P.S: I'm quite the pot smoker, so i'm hoping to attract the same.

P.P.S: &lt;--- does that even exist? Either way, I've been NY-ized so I curse a lot with the friends. I do not talk like this at work or in a formal/professional surrounding or if it makes *people* uncomfortable.

I don't even know why I'm posting this, but I think I'll give it a shot.
What is there to tell about me ? Good question...

I guess I'm a 21 year-old guy who is sick and tired of being alone. And yes, I had girlfriends before and I'm not anti-social, fat, extremely ugly (I assume at least) or totally nerdy. I just realized that I'm surrounded by a lot of (superficial)people who think that the important things in life are to befriend people to some extent, hang out with them for a while and then do trash talk about them behind their backs, as if it was the most ordinary thing in life. So I needed a break and enjoyed it. But I'm done with that now - that's why posting here I guess.

I really enjoy e-Sports like StarCraftII, LoL, Quake.. or maybe just e-Sports in general, watching movies, chillin out, jogging, smokin some pot sometimes and a good conversation. Additionally, reading some good Mangas (not that typical mainstream shit, so it rarely happens, that I find a really good one). I rarely met some girls who enjoyed those things aswell here in Europe, or maybe I didn't search good enough?! So I guessed that there might be a person, or even some more,  who share interests with me.

Working an IT position with a local company.

I am the prototypical nerd... I am an avid reader. I am a huge game player (video, board, card, etc.), mainly PC now a days, although I just got a 3DS. I love doing things outside also and other activities... hiking, soccer, football, volleyball, tennis, basketball, ping pong, bike riding, bowling... pretty much anything I can find something to do with someone, I will:) I love watching activities (such as sports) in addition to participating in them. 

I am a big fan of tv series, such as Lost and 24. I enjoy movies, although have not seen many because I prefer watching them with others. :)

I play acoustic guitar and love music. I talk and text a lot. I am fairly shy in person.

Only ever had 1 girlfriend in my life, so I am not sure what my turn offs, etc. are.

I can elaborate more on any points as requested. I will try many things.

Here's my boring story: My ex-girlfriend of just about three years broke up with me. I say just about because she actually broke up with me not even two weeks before our three year anniversary. Yes, it was painful to say the least but I can't say I didn't see it coming. I've been single for over two years now. I'm more than anything a relationship person (as opposed to just hooking up with people all the time), so for me personally, it sucks being single. I no doubt have the sex drive of any 23 year old male but I’m also a very simple guy. I enjoy the simple pleasures like spending my Friday nights with my significant other cuddling under the blankies with a nice warm cup of hot cocoa and a movie playing through Netflix. In the two years I've been ForeverAlone I’ve only gone on two dates. The first date was unsuccessful. It was with a girl who I met on OKCupid and was more excited to meet me than I was her – need I say anymore?  My next date, whom I met through PlentyofFish wasn’t as unsuccessful and if you can call now having that person in my life as one of the best friends I’ve ever had then I don’t regret anything at all. Aside from that, online dating hasn’t really worked for me and meeting people in real life so far obviously hasn’t worked for me much either. Admittedly, I’m shy, but in no way socially awkward/inept. 
What really stings is seeing one of my friends not even be single for a month and already she has had more attention from guys in the time she’s been single (again, less than a month) than I have in all of my two years being single. Granted, she’s a girl, she has boobs, therefore it’s to be expected she gets more attention than a guy – still stings though, hence here I am hoping to receive a little love from my fellow Redditors :)

Honestly, I’m in no rush at all to be in a relationship regardless of how I may sound. I’m not desperate.  I really like to get to know someone first before I jump into a relationship with them, so I’m not some relationship freak or what have you. 

As for pics (we all like pics, right?) I’ll just link my OkCupid profile:

I have been there for 5 years, 3 different companies, 4 bosses and numerous coworkers. I am good at what I do but it isn't something I want to do for the rest of my life. I am planning to go to school this fall, depending on if I can get enough time to finish setting it up. I plan to work in the tech field in hospitals. My sense of humor is all over the board and not much offends me, if anything at all. Personality wise I am a special kind of strange. Not the bad kind but the ""always keeps you entertained and on your toes"" kind.

I am looking to pick up new hobbies but I love video games, anime, reading, and just doing whatever tickles my fancy at the time. I love action and comedy movies but I will watch just about anything (even if its god awful, as these are where the most fun is had!) and for TV shows I am currently watching Dexter, The Walking Dead and will be starting Breaking Bad pretty soon. Music I will listen to anything but I find what I listen to the most are bands like Combichrist, Stratovarius, Grendel, Deathstars and sometimes 90's hits stations on Slacker radio (weird, right?)

I have no idea what I am looking for. Guess I will know when I find the right person. Just hoping they share the same love of games, movies, tv shows and anime as I do. Dont be afraid to send a message! Never know if I might be your never ending supply of fun :D
