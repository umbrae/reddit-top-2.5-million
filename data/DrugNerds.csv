1356771045.0,208,self.DrugNerds,15m9sf,MDMA Supplementation,276,68,240,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15m9sf/mdma_supplementation/,"Ok, I did promise that I would make another post regarding supplementation to mitigate MDMA induced neurotoxicity. I have just been putting it off. Since my last post, I have gathered more information regarding my theory about MDA metabolism being the main cause of MDMA's neurotoxic effects. I will try to not get into that in this post, and keep this mostly about supplementation. As seems to be the norm with me, this may be long winded. Obviously everything I put on this list is not necessary. I will be placing supplements into different categories, with reasonings and references. I will let you decide which ones will be a part of your regimen.

_______________________________________________________
**Essential Supplements:**

* **Alpha Lipoic Acid**- This is one that everyone should be taking. [It is a powerful antioxidant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7649494) that scavenges reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. It also has a nice benefit of regenerating other vitamins, like C, after redox cycling. [It exists in two enantiomers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9383983), R-ALA and S-ALA. R-ALA is the biologically active isomer that we are looking for. Most supplements are racemic, or a mix of both. Racemic ALA does not reach as high of plasma levels as R-ALA, nor does it stay in the blood as long. It's half life is very short, ~30min. If that is all you can find, it's much better than nothing. R-ALA by itself is very unstable, and is not suitable for supplementation. This is where bonding it to sodium comes into play. Na-R-ALA, or sodium R alpha lipoic acid, allows for stable delivery of just the dextrorotory isomer of ALA. [Here is a study on the benefits of Na-R-ALA](http://www.geronova.com/sites/default/files/alt_med_rev_2008_0.pdf). [And here is the study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10619665) showing that ALA prevented MDMA induced neurotoxicity, even though body temperatures still rose.

Dosage and time schedule: 

Racemic ALA- 200mg before MDMA dose and every hour of roll.

Na-R-ALA- 100mg before and every 2 hours of roll.

* **Bioavailable magnesium supplement**- [MDMA induces a release of extracellular glutamate in the hippocampus.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23179355) Glutamate is the body's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. It binds to NMDA receptor sites, along with glycine, opening the ion channels and allowing calcium to enter the neuron. This is how the brain sends cascading electrical signals. When the ion channels open for too long or too frequently, calcium concentrations can become too high in the neuron. This can lower the effectiveness of your ion channels, or can even cause neuronal death. [Magnesium is the substance your body uses](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044576584710128) to block the channel in a voltage-dependent manner. This means that the ion channel will not allow Ca2+ to pass, even if glutamate and glycine are bound to their receptor sites. However, once the neuronal membrane's electrical potential rises to an excited state, the [Mg molecule will clear](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1661812) the channel and allow for normal operation. Most people are deficient in magnesium as it is. Supplementing a highly bioavailable magnesium supplement will give your body the substance it needs to naturally protect itself from excitotoxicity. [Here is a picture I made to illustrate.](http://imgur.com/1rREv) There are a number of different types of magnesium supplements. Some are not absorbed very well, other are. The most common form, oxide, is one of the worst. This is where the concept of chelation comes into play. Magnesium is a substance the readily binds to insoluble salts in the stomach and intestines. This makes it hard to absorb. However, if you chelate the magnesium molecule to a soluble amino acid, it prevents it's binding to insoluble salts, as well as opening up the possibilities for active transport. This means that fully chelated magnesium is absorbed much better by the body. There are a number of different Mg/amino acid combinations. My favorite is magnesium glycinate. This is Mg chelated to a glycine molecule. It can be found cheaply and is highly bioavailable. There is also citrate, L-theonate, oroate, taurate, lysinate, etc. I will let you decide on which one you want to try.

Dosage and time schedule:

Magnesium Glycinate- 2,000mg (200mg elemental Mg) 6 hours before, 1 hour before, and during.

* **Vitamin C**- This is a widely known antioxidant. It will help scavenge any reactive oxygen species that get created. [It has been shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15212815) to prevent MDMA induced hepatotoxicity. [It has also been shown](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1098-2396%28200104%2940:1%3C55::AID-SYN1026%3E3.0.CO;2-O/abstract) to mitigate neurotoxicity as well. I like to take Emergen-C packets with me when I am on MDMA. This gives me C, plus electrolytes and a number of other substances. It will also raise stomach acidity, which will slow absorption of MDMA through the stomach and intestines. I take Tums 30min prior to MDMA to lower the acidity and increase absorption. I also drink it throughout the night, raising my urinary acidity. This allows me to excrete much of the MDMA in my urine before it metabolizes to harmful substances.

Dosage and time schedule:

Emergen-C packet- (1,000mg vitamin C) 1 hour before and during

* **Grape Seed Extract**- GSA is a supplement high in vitamin E and flavonoids. [Vitamin E deficiency has been shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11931860) to increase the severity of MDMA induced neurotoxicity. Also, flavonoids are potent antioxidants that will help protect against lipid oxidation and reactive oxygen species.

Dosage and time schedule:

Grape seed extract- 100mg before and during

* **Grapefruit Juice**- My other post spoke about CYP3A4 metabolizing MDMA to MDA using N-demethylation. MDA is [MUCH more neurotoxic](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7582557) than MDMA, and I spoke to why before. I am not going to rehash the specifics here, but there is no doubt that any MDA in your system is bad for you. [The furanocoumarins present](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9351897) in grapefruit juice are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. [This study showed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11061578) a 90% reduction in CYP3A4 metabolism after grapefruit juice ingestion. [This study measured](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663855/) metabolism to MDA in humans. How much of your MDMA dose gets metabolized to MDA depends on a number of different factors, like dose, re-dosing schedule, body temperature, etc. Drinking grapefruit juice will drastically inhibit this metabolism. Your MDMA plasma levels will be higher when taking GFJ, so be aware of that when selecting dosages. It also has vitamin C and will increase stomach/intestinal/urinary acidity. This will help excrete MDMA in urine unmetabolized.

Dosage and time schedule: Drink some in the morning, an hour before drop, and some later in the night.

______________________________________________________________________________

**Suggested Supplements:**

* **Acetyl-L-carnitine**- [Is synergistic with](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12640-010-9165-3?LI=true) alpha lipoic acid, and protects against oxidative stress. [Has been shown](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452208015947) to prevent MDMA induced neurotoxicity.

Dosage and time schedule: 

ALCAR- 500mg before and during

* **Green Tea Extract (EGCG)**- Is a potent antioxidant and diuretic. It will help with the urinary retention arising from [MDMA induced vasopressin release](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574714).

Dosage and time schedule: 

Green tea extract- 400mg before and during

* **5-HTP**- 5-HTP is the direct precursor to serotonin (5-HT). It is created from tryptophan in your diet using the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). [MDMA can reduce TPH levels](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8496826) for weeks after use. This will make it harder for your body to produce the necessary 5-HT from normal dietary sources alone. Since 5-HTP does not need TPH, supplementing it the few days following your roll will help you body restore it's 5-HT levels. 5-HTP can pass your blood brain barrier, while 5-HT cannot. This means that when you supplement 5-HTP, you want to make sure it gets converted to 5-HT in your brain and not your periphery. The enzyme that converts 5-HTP to 5-HT is aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. [It is found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/241675) in your stomach and periphery, as well as your brain. This means that we have to inhibit it, so that your 5-HTP has time to pass your blood brain barrier. [EGCG is an inhibitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11374875) of L-amino acid decarboxylase (Also known as DOPA decarboxylase). ALWAYS take EGCG with your 5-HTP to ensure that your brain is getting the serotonin, and not your periphery. Excess 5-HT in the periphery can [cause heart valve damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15781732).

Dosage and time schedule: 

5-HTP (with 400mg EGCG)- 100mg before bed for 3-7 days following MDMA use

* **Melatonin**- Melatonin is created from serotonin. Your body uses it to control sleep/wake cycles. [It is also a very powerful antioxidant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14740000). After using MDMA, your serotonin levels will be low, and your melatonin levels will be affected. Taking a melatonin supplement before bed will help you sleep, but will also help scavenge any oxidative substances your other antioxidants have missed.

Dosage and time schedule:

Melatonin- 5-10mg before bed (Keep in mind we are using a higher dose here for it's antioxidant properties. Normal dosages should be .5mg to 1mg.)

* **CoQ10**- When your NMDA receptors open and allow Ca2+ to influx into the neuron, that calcium must then be pumped back out of the neuron to bring it back down to resting potential. Protein pumps are what force the Ca2+ back into the extracellular space. To do this, they need andenosine triphosphate (ATP). CoQ10 is used by your body to synthesize ATP, which will allow your protein pumps to be able to expel the excess Ca2+ more efficiently. This will protect your neurons from exitotoxicity.

Dosage and time schedule:

CoQ10- 100mg before

In every one of these threads, some redditor(s) will comment that they prefer smoking, and that it gives them a different high. This often results in a debate, as many will argue back that temperatures below combustion should release most of the drugs into the air, and that higher temperatures only causes nonactive carcinogens to release.

While this is sometimes explained by the few cannabinoids that vaporize at temperatures close to combustion (such as CBD) or by the psychological effect of smoking, this isn't the whole story.

Very few people are aware of this, but some of carcinogens are actually quite psychoactive, one example being acetaldehyde.

Acetaldehyde is a neurotoxic chemical that is created by smoking [tobacco](http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+75-07-0) or [cannabis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18705690) (as well as most other things). It is the primary metabolite of [ethanol](http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol44/volume44.pdf). It is recognized as [a carcinogen](http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out275_en.pdf), [a hepatotoxin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3235803), and [a likely neurotoxin](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/oximed/2011/213286/).

Unfortunately, that's not all it does.

Acetaldehyde [combines with serotonin precursors as well as dopamine to form the Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) harman and salsolinol.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17382522) This augments the [MAOI effects of cannabinoids](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20401651), [makes nicotine more addictive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21696345), and  [makes alcohol more addictive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22351424). Acetaldehyde might even be addictive [by itself](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22324727).

There are many other carcinogens in smoke, but this chemical is (to my knowledge) the best studied.

This is probably disheartening to hear, that vaporizing cannot give the same kind of high, and, furthermore, that the three of the most commonly used 'drugs' are most enjoyable and addictive in their most toxic forms. Of course, these drugs are still enjoyable without this addictive toxin, but nothing's quite like that carcinogenic high.

**tl;dr: Smoking might feel better than vaporizing because acetaldehyde gets you mad high.**

1353553996.0,131,self.DrugNerds,13lp0b,MDMA Neurotoxicity Part 1 Metabolites),144,13,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/13lp0b/mdma_neurotoxicity_part_1_metabolites/,"This is probably going to be the first in a series of discussions I start about MDMA. There's just too much information for one post. Therefore, I am going to start with one that is very interesting to me: MDMA's metabolites and their role in neurotoxicity. I pre-appologise for the length and terminology used.

_________________________________________________

First off, let's discuss how MDMA is metabolized. The human cytochrome CYP450 is responsible for the metabolism of MDMA. The primary enzyme responsible is CYP2D6, using O-demethylation. This process adds two hydrogen atoms to the two open oxygen atoms in MDMA to create HHMA. Let's look at the structure for a minute.

________________________________________________

MDMA is 3,4-**methylenedioxy**-N-methylamphetamine

HHMA is 3,4-**dihydroxy**-N-methylamphetamine

So your CYP2D6 enzyme added two hydrogen atoms to the methylenedioxy structure to create a dihydroxy structure. Once it's been o-demethylated to HHMA, it is no longer active like MDMA is. HHMA can then be 0-methylated further to HMMA, or 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine. [Here is an image to help you visualize this process.](http://imgur.com/RY6Mt)

This is the primary route of metabolism.
________________________________________________________

Is that the end of the story? Nope! Yes MDMA is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. However, a portion of your dose (~10%) is also metabolized by your CYP3A4 enzyme using N-demethylation. What substance is created by this process? MDA, or 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine. You see, this time your CYP3A4 enzyme changed the methyl group at the N position, and not the O position. This modified the methyl group into an amine group. We are now left with MDMA's more neurotoxic brother in our blood stream.

[Let's add this into the picture from above.](http://imgur.com/xTDcQ)

_________________________________________________

MDA is then metabolized in the exact same manner MDMA was, o-demetylation by CYP2D6. So we add two hydrogen atoms to the O position to create HHA, or 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine. So we essentially end up with HHMA with an amine group at the N position instead of a methyl group. It can also be o-methylated further (like HHMA) into HMA 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine. Same thing as HMMA, just with an amine group instead of the methyl group. 

_____________________________________________

So at this point you might be thinking how this all really matters. Well MDMA and MDA injected directly into the brain have [been shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11351932) to **NOT** be neurotoxic. Well shit, there we go. Metabolism is to blame.

Not so fast! [A study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1908797/pdf/brjpharm00190-0167.pdf) showed that individuals with lower CYP2D6 did not show lower neurotoxicity. In fact, they showed slightly higher. [It may have led](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874389/) to some deaths as well. This led to the notion being tabled for a while.

___________________________________________

So what is up then? Well where is the next logical place to look? Perhaps **CYP3A4!!!!!**

__________________________________________

A person that has a genetic condition resulting in lower CYP2D6 enzyme is going to have what happen to their MDMA? A greater percentage will be N-demethylated to MDA by CYP3A4.

This is going to lead to what? Higher HHA serum levels.

HHA is what? [A potent neurotoxin!](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378)

____________________________________________________

So MDMA and MDA injected directly into the brain show NO neurotoxicity. Individuals with lower CYP2D6 enzyme show higher levels of neurotoxicity. This leads me to believe that HHMA is not the primary culprit (probably still a factor though).

MDA has been shown to be much more neurotoxic than MDMA. MDA is NOT neurotoxic when directly injected into the brain. MDA cannot be metabolized into HHMA, but is directly metabolized to HHA. HHA is a potent neurotoxin.

Is anybody smelling what I am cooking over here?!? MDA is the cause of MDMA's neurotoxicity through metabolism to HHA (Also known as alpha-methyldopamine). **BOOM!**

[Alpha-methyldopamine causes neurotoxicity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9128836)

[Another link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378)


[And another!](http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/37/7/1448.full.pdf)

______________________________________________________

Now I have been taking quercetin and grapefruit juice with my MDMA for a while now. These substances are CYP3A4 inhibitors. I knew that CYP3A4 metabolized part of my dose to MDA. I knew it was more neurotoxic, which is why I did this. However, I did not connect the dots as to why it was more neurotoxic.

Many postulated it was because of MDA's higher affinity for dopamine. However, why then did direct injections of it in the brain not cause neurotoxicity? If it was dopamine being re-uptaked by your SERT that was causing the damage, it would still be present when MDMA or MDA was directly injected into the brain. In fact, it would be higher. Yet we saw NO neurotoxicity.

Others were skeptical because the metabolism to HHA was only seen in rats. However, [the 2009 study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378) proved it happened in humans too! So hot damn, I am pretty sure this is a verifiable theory here. We definitely need studies to prove it though.

**TL;DR I postulate that MDMA induced 5-HT neurotoxicity arises from the metabolism to MDA, consequently creating HHA or alpha-methyldopamine. Another route of neurotoxicy comes from the ring-hydroxylation of MDA to THA, or 2,4,5-trihydroxyamphetamine. Inhibit CYP3A4 using grapefruit juice to stop the metabolism to MDA and prevent both metabolites from being created.**

____________________________________________________

Now do **NOT** take what I am saying as the end all and be all of potential MDMA induced damage. There is excitotoxicity at your ion channels, as well as other oxidative damage that can come into play. I will speak to these in other posts. This has also not been proven yet. So please take this post as a starting point, not a final answer. Feel free to pick apart my theory and find anything that I may have overlooked.

The Advice Letter (pdf) from the FDA requested several changes to the exclusion criteria involving subject safety, some of which we thought were not necessary based on existing scientific literature. We have prepared an amended protocol incorporating some of these changes, along with evidence for why we don't think the other changes are necessary. Once the FDA has reviewed and approved this amendment, we will submit the protocol and study materials for review by the Institutional Review Board at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center/Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute. Charles Grob, M.D., and Alicia Danforth, Ph.D.(c), will be co-investigators for this study. 

We have a lot of work to do to raise the roughly $15 million we still need to complete our MDMA-assisted psychotherapy studies. We ask you to help us change minds and make medicines.

For all you autodidacts, aspiring neuroscientists/pharmacologists, or those needing a review - I've been producing powerpoints on various subjects in neurobiology for my own education for a while now, and I have generally tried to share them by producing an ""intermediate"" version for myself, and a ""beginner"" version for the casual student.
 
 
I am a firm believer in the notion that the ability to communicate understanding of a subject to the layperson is the truest indicator of actual knowledge, and I greatly enjoy being asked questions that I am forced to look up the answers to. I find this increases my retention.
 
I have uploaded a very basic lesson on the nervous system, and a more advanced explanation of the basics of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, albeit sloppily put together.

I have seen a recurring theme of people questioning how they can pursue the field of psychedelic science. [MAPS](http://maps.org)  has compiled a comprehensive list of academic institutions, advice from scientists, and other resources to help put you on the right track to learning about psychedelics.

Here is [the list](http://maps.org/resources/students/) of courses, programs, and institutions that offer education in areas involving psychology, psychedelics, transpersonal studies, etc.

* [Bard College](http://bard.edu/)
* [California Institute of Integral Studies](http://ciis.edu/) 
* [The Institute of Imaginal Studies](http://imaginalstudies.org/)
* [John F. Kennedy University](http://jfk.edu/)
* [Liverpool John Moores University](http://livjm.ac.uk/)
* [Naropa University](http://naropa.edu/)
* [New College of Florida](http://ncf.edu/)
* [Northern Illinois University](http://niu.academia.edu/ThomasRoberts)
* [Pacific College of Oriental Medicine](http://pacificcollege.edu)
* [Pacifica Graduate Institute](http://pacifica.edu/)
* [Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center](http://saybrook.edu/)
* [Sofia University](http://sofia.edu/home.php)
* [State University of West Georgia, Psychology Department](http://westga.edu/psydept/)

I recommend reading the following two articles on our [For Students resource page](http://maps.org/resources/students/):

* How Does One Go About Performing Research with Psychedelics?
* So You Want to be a Psychedelic Researcher?

Be sure to check out the [other resources](http://maps.org/resources/students/)  on the page, in addition to the rest of the MAPS site if you are unfamiliar. 

Good luck to anyone interested in pursuing the field of psychedelic science!

Selegiline dramatically reduces MDMA neurotoxicity and enhances the effects of MDMA. In my experience and the experience of my friends, selegiline almost completely prevents an MDMA hangover.

Selegiline is a selective MAO-B inhibitor. It blocks the activity of the MAO-B enzyme, while leaving MAO-A unaffected. This is very important for MDMA useage.

MAO-B is a primary cause of MDMA toxicity. MAO-B produces toxic products when it acts on MDMA metabolites or dopamine. When coming down from a roll, serotonin levels decline more rapidly than dopamine levels. Consequently, dopamine is elevated while serotonin is depleted. Consequently, dopamine penetrates into serotonin channels, where its not supposed to be. Dopamine then contacts MAO-B, which produces toxic metabolites that cause significant oxidative damage to serotonin neurons. Some dispute that its the dopamine, and instead argue that only MDMA metabolites are the cause. But either way, its the MAO-B enzyme that creates the toxins. MAO-B also creates neurotoxic products when it acts on other drugs, such as some cancer chemo drugs. 

Accordingly, neurotoxicity is prevented by turning off the MAO-B enzyme. It works like a charm.

A scientific paper published in 2007 reported the results of animal experiments in which the neuroprotective effect of selegiline was proven. The title is ""Monoamine Oxidase-B Mediates Ecstasy-Induced Neurotoxic Effects to Adolescent Rat Brain Mitochondria"" by Alves et al. Link is here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17881526

There are a couple of important safety precautions to be aware of: 1) NON-selective MAO inhibition while taking MDMA is dangerous. So dont dake anything that is an MAO-A inhibitor. 2) Selegiline at high dosages becomes NON-SELECTIVE. At 1-2 mg it is selective for MAO-B only. At dosages possibly as low as 10mg, selegiline could start to turn off MAO-A, which is dangerous for people on MDMA. 3) Selegiline at 1-2 mg increases the effect of MDMA. it is an MDMA potentiator. This is great because you can use less, and suffer less of the other types of MDMA toxicity. But this also means that one can trip too hard. So take selegiline BEFORE rolling, and titrate the MDMA dose, especially the first time using this combo. I estimate that selegiline can potentiate about 2-3 fold (so you only need about 1/2-1/3 the dose).

Selegiline is generally available by script only, but there are some places where it can be found online. 

Im curious to hear if others have experiences, good or bad, combining selegiline and MDMA.

I've heard a bit here and there (anecdotal and scientific) about salvia being a good emergency anti-relapse drug, and also somewhat of an anti-depressive. Personal experience agree's with this...

Also, IMO tramadol is a great mood lifter for a while, really gives your feel-goods and feel-happys a nice boost and turns those slumps around pretty well. It's a mostly a mu opiate agonist, but also a serotonin releasing agent, norepinephrine  reuptake inhibitor, and a weak NMDA antagonist, and 5ht2c antagonist. 5ht2c agonists and antagonists downregulate 5ht2c, and this sensitizes the reward pathways, so I think this is why I feel great the next day. Together it blends so well for a dreamy, energetic, and happy day. And as a bonus, it get metabolized into a stronger opiate that really kicks in around bedtime.

Also, Ibogaine sounds impressive, and  5h1a agonists seem to have potential....

When I was younger I was a pretty smart kid, but I abused different drugs pretty heavily.

Smoked a little bit of weed around 16, then got heavy into prescriptions, had scripts to Vyvanse and Xanax, Xanax basically made me more depressed, pretty mellow and monotone in speech, Vyvanse made me pretty crazy, I believe I had amphetamine psychosis in school at age 17 and was transferred to a school for teenagers struggling with emotional and behavioral issues.

After I graduated I spent the next 3 years smoking large amounts of weed, I got into hallucinogens and had a couple bad trips that made my insecurities a lot worse and gave me a crippling social anxiety, which is the main thing I'm working on.

I did large amounts of molly/ecstasy a few times over the course of a year and had serotonin syndrome...twice. Yes, I know there's a lot of debate on this subject on whether one actually experienced SS but I did, I was diagnosed it, and after researching other people's symptoms of SS here on reddit from the AMAs they follow my own perfectly.

I went to rehab after my last and worst bout of SS in August and am now sober from all substances, including scripts, alcohol and weed. I am going to start seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist in a couple of weeks and that will be weekly. I am exercising for 30-90 minutes a session about 4-7 days a week, and eating as well as I can/taking supplements (none are serotonergic). 

What else would speed my recovery? Who else should I talk to? Will I recover? I hear SS recovery takes 12-18 months, I'm 6 months in. I have this doubt in the back of my mind I'll never fully recover. I'm trying my hardest and despite my slow progress I'm losing hope.

I've been taking the two doses combined (50mg) for the past few days at night right before sleep time, that is to avoid any sort of compulsive sedation/drowsiness. The good news is that I woke up next morning fully refreshed, with my muscle spasms almost fully gone. Shockingly, I also noticed how scary good my mood have become, to the point that everything I had a glimpse over could only conceive as positive, intriguingly compelling, regardless of how silly or trivial it actually is.

I couldn't make myself think negative at all, I was overly fucking happy, that I frankly started to feel a bit concerned. For the most part, I felt that life has finally become so damn easy to understand, my understanding of logic and level of consciousness were very much heightened -- I thought I knew it all. Everything was totally smooth. Felt energetic, scarily smart, charming and exceedingly witty, with a genuine sense of sarcasm. Confidence was remarkably elevated. For what it's worth I was finally able to feel the positives of caffeine. Very weird.

I thought I could solve any problem there is. Anxiety was wiped out and switched by supreme optimism/calmness. The first day I was fully fucking aware that this isn't normal, and that all will fade out the next time. Well much to my surprise, the effects for the next three days were overwhelmingly pronounced, even more than what I described the first day, to the point that I woke up this morning and started uncontrollably crying of how happy I was feeling.

A mentor of mine once told me that, ""the truest indication of knowledge is the ability to communicate an understanding to the layperson.""
 
* I firmly believe that the most effective way to master any educational material is to teach it to others without relying on technical language any more than needed - if we can make the average person understand the dynamics/kinetics involved in these lessons, then we've got a damn good understanding.*

I've seen quite a few autodidacts and academics alike around here, and I've yet to speak with anyone who wasn't intelligent, considerate towards the user base, and (at least somewhat) interested in a community  effort to try and educate each other in the interest of scholarship and/or harm reduction.

 
 


 I'd like to call on everyone here who is interested in this sort of collective project to participate in any way you feel you can - whether that is through publishing your own lessons here **(***I will gladly add it to our list/upload to our mediafire if it meets our standards* - **see below)**, offering fact checking/quality control, or even just letting us know what you'd like to see next!

**Here's how this will work; Team r/DrugNerds will be ""publishing"" the projects we've already got lined up (a profile of major neurotransmitters, followed by an in-depth lesson on nerve cell function/anatomy) - following which we will either begin filling public requests, or choosing something ourselves if nobody has asked for any specific subject matter.**
 
---
 
**All lessons will be released in both an ""Intermediate"" format; intended for undergraduate bio/chem students, as well as in an ""Introductory"" format that could be understood by even the most casual of students. We will, from this point forward, be providing all of our citations and must demand that all of our other contributors do as well in order to have a submission posted here.**

We thrive off of community feedback, and we welcome **any and all constructive criticism** - please be frank with us! The endeavors of the project should reflect what the members of the sub want to learn.

**Anyone interested in joining the project team should send me a PM explaining your areas of interest within the discipline, as well as any relevant background info.**

One where it feels like more or less time has passed then there actually has, and another where it actively feels like reality is moving slower or faster than it is. 

The first type is readily apparent on cannabis and psychedelics. I just forget how much time has passed. On Adderall (which I take daily for ADD), I get the same type, but in the opposite direction. It seems like it's been 20 minutes, when it's actually been hours. This is usually when I'm intensely focused on research.

The second type is where reality actively feels like it's moving slower or faster. If I listen to a high tempo song first thing in the morning, it sounds incredibly fast-paced, as opposed to listening to the same song later in the day. I've experienced a more intense version of this on psychedelics. Again, this is reversed on Adderall - songs seem a little slower, but not dramatically.

Is this due to the brain's clock, the fact that the brain is processing data at a different rate, or something else entirely?

My dreams of a herbal valium were dashed when I found out it's about 100 times less potent by weight, but still, flavone-derived drugs appear to be really interesting. Some of them exhibit highly potent and selective anxiolytic activity without any of the other effects associated with benzos (amnesia, sedation, muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant effects).

In particular, the synthetic [6,3′-dinitroflavone](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299996007844) has an anxiolytic action about 300 times more potent by weight compared to diazepam in animal models, but exhibits no other side effects at therapeutic doses. This compound, as well as the related 6-bromo-3'-nitroflavone were found by adding electronegative groups at key positions, by analogy with benzos, which can also be potentiated in such a manner. [Here](http://imgur.com/YWcDOK3) is a table summarizing rat and mouse studies of these compounds as compared to diazepam, taken from [Medina et al (1998)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711398800342).

I want to get a good discussion going. Here's the OP:

&gt;I've seen a hell of a lot of posts across all of the usual drugs subs involving people who are 15, 16, 17 asking if they should try acid. What shocks me more than the posts are the actual responses.

&gt;Here's the thread that really piqued my interest: http://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/13vwpt/am_i_too_young/

&gt;Granted it doesn't have a whole lot of replies, the replies there still worry me. Does nobody else worry that our brains are developing MOST in the 15-18 age range? 

&gt;I'm all for substances being different for everyone trying them, but holy hell, **I cannot see my 16 year old self taking acid (let alone being able to take in the experience) for any legitimate reason.**

&gt;I didn't smoke marijuana at all until I was 18. My first trip wasn't until I was almost 19. Nobody knows how glad I am with myself that I waited until these points to try it. Going to college and getting out of my 18 year high school ""bubble"" *was* a trip in and of itself. If I tripped before this point I cannot say what would have happened, and this scares the hell out of me. It scares the hell out of me when a 16 year old thinks they *need* to trip acid at such a young age.

&gt;Tripping acid my first time was incredibly enjoyable because past 18, not a whole lot of brain development occurs, at least not anything MAJOR. Who can seriously look back at their high school self and think ""Yeah, acid would have helped me in that time."" or ""I could have had a nice trip when I was that young.""? I do not see a sliver of a reason. 

&gt;Science has *proven* that marijuana use in this age bracket (15-18) can lead to a decrease in potential IQ because, you guessed it, our brains are still developing during this time. 

&gt;Psychedelics are **powerful** in many more degrees than marijuana. How can we think that it's safe for a sixteen year old to have a trip?

At this time I would drink every weekend (frat parties) and smoke weed 3-5 times a week. In the hospital, they gave me IVIG. My platelets went back to a normal level and they sent me back to school. Not even a month later my platelets were down to 6,000. They injected me with steroids and prescribed me to prednisone. The prednisone kept my platelets at a safe level but the it DESTROYED my body. As a result myself, my parents, and my doctor all wanted me off prednisone. After looking at my options, I taper off prednisone and receive WinRho. This would keep my platelets at a safe level for 2 months before I needed another injection. I got this in June and August. October comes along and my platelets are at 30,000. I am scheduled for a treatment after Halloween weekend. That weekend I rolled Friday and Saturday. We used a test kit and it was MDMA in moonrock form. This was my first roll (with real MDMA and not m1) since having ITP. I am going for my treatment and they test my blood expecting it to be lower than 30,000 since that's what it was the previous week. The results, however we're 70,000! The treatment was canceled. I did some research and found an anecdotal story about someone with itp doing e and having their platelets boosted, but no solid evidence. So a month later (first week of December) I roll again. And surely enough my platelets went up again since I was getting nearly weekly blood tests and could monitor. Well over a year later I have successfully been treating myself with MDMA. My parents and doctor know this. My hematologist has never heard of this before but there really is no explanation based on my patterns/rate of killing my platelets. My question is why/ how does MDMA boost my platelet levels?? I am a biology major that has been trying to research this but information lacks on the Internet and in journals.

**A case of 25I-NBOMe (25-I) intoxication: a new potent 5-HT2A agonist designer drug.**

&gt;Abstract
&gt;CONTEXT:
&gt;Abuse of synthetic stimulant compounds resulting in significant toxicity is being increasingly reported by poison centers. Toxicologic assessment is complicated by inconsistent manufacturing processes and limited laboratory testing. We describe a case of self-reported exposure to 25-I (25I-NBOMe), a novel phenethylamine derivative, with subsequent quantification in serum.
&gt;CASE DETAILS:
&gt;An 18-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe agitation and hallucinations after jumping out of a moving car. He was tachycardiac (150-160 bpm) and hypertensive (150-170 mm Hg systolic and 110 mg Hg diastolic), and required physical restraints and treatment with intravenous lorazepam administration. His symptoms gradually improved and vital signs returned to normal over 48 h, though he continued to have episodes of aggressiveness. An assay was developed by our analytical toxicology laboratory for 25-I, and serum obtained during ED evaluation and treatment was found to contain 0.76 ng/ml of 25-I. Case discussion. For 25I-NBOMe, 25-I is a common abbreviation for 25I-NBOMe, which is a (n-benzyl) phenethylamine in the 2C ""family.""Initially synthesized for research, cases of self-reported use of 25-I have recently appeared in the literature, some of which contain qualitative urine confirmation. There are no commercially available quantitative assays, and no previous reports have published serum concentrations. 25-I is a potent new synthetic drug with apparent significant behavioral toxicity that can be detected and quantified in serum.

**Severe clinical toxicity associated with analytically confirmed recreational use of 25I–NBOMe: case series**

http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15563650.2013.802795?prevSearch=allfield%253A%252825I-NBOMe%2529&amp;searchHistoryKey=

&gt;Context. 4-Iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)phenethylamine (25I-NBOMe) is a N-methoxybenzyl-substituted phenethylamine with potent serotoninergic effects. We describe seven cases of analytically confirmed toxicity due to the recreational use of 25I-NBOMe in the United Kingdom. Case series. Seven patients, all young adult males, presented to hospitals in the northeast of England with clinical toxicity after recreational drug use in January 2013. Clinical features included tachycardia (n = 7), hypertension (4), agitation (6), aggression, visual and auditory hallucinations (6), seizures (3), hyperpyrexia (3), clonus (2), elevated white cell count (2), elevated creatine kinase (7), metabolic acidosis (3), and acute kidney injury (1). LC–MS/MS analysis identified 25I-NBOMe as the main active substance in the plasma of all seven cases. Conclusions. Severe clinical toxicity may occur following recreational use of 25I-NBOMe, with stimulant and serotoninergic features predominating. Clinicians should be alert to this substance, in view of its emergence in Europe as well as in the United States.

**Radiosynthesis and Evaluation of 11C-CIMBI-5 as a 5-HT2A Receptor Agonist Radioligand for PET**

&gt;Abstract
&gt;
&gt;PET brain imaging of the serotonin 2A (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A, or 5-HT2A) receptor has been widely used in clinical studies, and currently, several well-validated radiolabeled antagonist tracers are used for in vivo imaging of the cerebral 5-HT2A receptor. Access to 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET tracers would, however, enable imaging of the active, high-affinity state of receptors, which may provide a more meaningful assessment of membrane-bound receptors. In this study, we radiolabel the high-affinity 5-HT2A receptor agonist 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C-OCH3]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine (11C-CIMBI-5) and investigate its potential as a PET tracer. Methods: The in vitro binding and activation at 5-HT2A receptors by CIMBI-5 was measured with binding and phosphoinositide hydrolysis assays. Ex vivo brain distribution of 11C-CIMBI-5 was investigated in rats, and PET with 11C-CIMBI-5 was conducted in pigs. Results: In vitro assays showed that CIMBI-5 was a high-affinity agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor. After intravenous injections of 11C-CIMBI-5, ex vivo rat studies showed a specific binding ratio of 0.77 ± 0.07 in the frontal cortex, which was reduced to cerebellar levels after ketanserin treatment, thus indicating that 11C-CIMBI-5 binds selectively to the 5-HT2A receptor in the rat brain. The PET studies showed that the binding pattern of 11C-CIMBI-5 in the pig brain was in accordance with the expected 5-HT2A receptor distribution. 11C-CIMBI-5 gave rise to a cortical binding potential of 0.46 ± 0.12, and the target-to-background ratio was similar to that of the widely used 5-HT2A receptor antagonist PET tracer 18F-altanserin. Ketanserin treatment reduced the cortical binding potentials to cerebellar levels, indicating that in vivo 11C-CIMBI-5 binds selectively to the 5-HT2A receptor in the pig brain. Conclusion: 11C-CIMBI-5 showed a cortex-to-cerebellum binding ratio equal to the widely used 5-HT2A antagonist PET tracer 18F-altanserin, indicating that 11C-CIMBI-5 has a sufficient target-to-background ratio for future clinical use and is displaceable by ketanserin in both rats and pigs. Thus, 11C-CIMBI-5 is a promising tool for investigation of 5-HT2A agonist binding in the living human brain.

**Molecular Interaction of Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor Residues Phe339(6.51) and Phe340(6.52) with Superpotent N-Benzyl Phenethylamine Agonists**

&gt;ABSTRACT
&gt;Experiments were conducted to examine the molecular basis
&gt;for the high affinity and potency of a new class of 5-HT2A
&gt;receptor agonists, N-benzyl phenethylamines. Competition
&gt;binding assays at several serotonin receptors confirmed that an
&gt;N-arylmethyl substitution was necessary for affinity increases
&gt;up to 300-fold over simple N-alkyl homologs, as well as enhanced selectivity for 5-HT2A versus 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors. PI hydrolysis functional assays confirmed that these Nbenzyl phenethylamines are potent and highly efficacious
&gt;agonists at the rat 5-HT2A receptor. Virtual docking of these
&gt;compounds into a human 5-HT2A receptor homology model
&gt;indicated that the N-benzyl moiety might be interacting with
&gt;Phe339(6.51), whereas the phenethylamine portion was likely to
&gt;be interacting with Phe340(6.52). Experiments in h5-HT2A receptors with Phe339(6.51)L and Phe340(6.52)L mutations seem to

There really are SO many more GREAT papers on the hippocampus, I especially liked this recent one:

http://www.pnas.org/content/109/47/19462.long

Which I think these studies show the reasoning why memory takes a hit, especially moreso with 25i.




**On a side note:**


I've done 25i 30-40 times, I've had the kidney pain at times, too. I've read a lot of other reports on this (need links? I have a write-up on my tumblr ) - this study released a few days ago is the fisrt to report kidney failure.

**Also we still need to know the specifics:**


- rapid super tolerance (check: higher rate of hppd)
- some report possible perma-tolerance (unsupported so far)
- Future trips up to 6 months feel reminiscent of NBOMe
- Muscle twitching* in the weeks after* (neurodegenerative? check: 7 case study results)
- some report headaches/migrains for up to 3/4weeks.
- Much higher rate of HPPD (check: 5ht2a saturation and mutation, also shroomery posts)
- why does piracetam a neuroprotective compound allow people to remember trips in vivid detail? What role does this play in the hippcampus with neurogensis (check: latest paper on neurogensis and memory coding)
- some report hair oil changes, their hair feels different afterwards
- more on the uncommon kidney pain


I have some theories, which definitely don't show 25i as all too safe

Proper dosages and spread out seems to be ok

Although I have written a lot more, the above link is the best example of what I am attempting to create. I would genuinely appreciate the many people of this subreddit who know more than me to take even just a quick look at it. 

It is essentially a complete breakdown, organization and description of each of the sensory (not cognitive) effects of the psychedelic experience in a logical and consistent manner. This breaks the experience down into 7 basic groups (visual enhancements, visual distortions, visual geometry, hallucinatory states, auditory effects, tactile effects and multisensory effects) which contain within them a total 19 individual subcomponents.

You might have already seen a significantly less organized version posted around the various drug subreddits hosted on www.disregardeverythingisay.com but I am attempting to formalize my project. I want to do this in a way that meets the criteria for a legitimate field of science. 
I am not an expert however, I am a mere stoner and am aware of the scientific limitations of a project like this. 

The data which I have catalogued is purely based on personal experience and I essentially want to move it beyond this but as you can probably guess, citing and referencing your sources is difficult when your data is based on a subjective experience. 
I have been working on this project for the past 3 years and its not close to finished so please do not judge it as so.

I've noticed that the scientific literature is studying hallucinogens from two angles, the first is the specific effects which these substances have on parts of the brain, the second is the benefits which these substances have in therapeutic settings. Although these are worthwhile pursuits nobody however seems to be trying to come to an understanding of the subjective experiences which these substances induce, which is the only real reason these things hold any inherent value in the first place. 

What do you think r/drugnerds? Is there any potential in a project like this? Could the exploration of consciousness (psychonautics) ever be promoted from a field of mysticism into a legitimate field of science? Or are there too many limitations in my methodology?

I can mix in as much butter as the mix will absorb, but after a certain point, it just doesn't dry properly and it tastes very strongly of pot (Not necessarily a bad thing). 

While I could make THC oil directly, my experience with the stuff has taught me that it might be too viscous to mix very easily (and too precious to throw into edibles haha). As such, I was wondering about the saturation point of THC in various lipids like butter and coconut oil. At what point will they stop holding more THC? 

Also, I've heard of needing heat for decarboxylation of THC for it to be fully orally active.

Sure, the increased BDNF caused by low dosing seems to check out and seems like a beneficial aspect to mental/cerebral health, but I've recently come across some studies proving ketamine induces apoptosis in rats and monkeys. 

The theory behind this, if I understand it correctly, is an overexpression of NR1 receptors, causing a higher calcium influx leading to oxidation and subsequently apoptosis, or neuronal death.
The article also states this damage might be evaded by supplementing with L-Carnitine. (Maybe any antioxidant would be fine? I have no idea)

Of course, this has never been proven in humans. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen like this in humans. For me, it's a cause for concern, and I would like you drugnerds to shed light on the issue. What is your opinion of these articles?

True it is partly the nature of the beast, but in my journeys I have identified 
two distintly different subtypes of K trip. A while back I had the distinct pleasure of trying the S and R isomers side by side, .5g of each. I had known for a while that the two different isomers created two different trips, but this experience brought remarkable clarity.

What amazed me the most is that the two are opposites of each other.

Let's start with S.

An S isomer trip is sedated and dreamy. Lounging around on the couch listening to Ravi Shankar with eyes closed is just perfect. CEVs are pronounced, seemingly taking me on a journey through an inner universe. A feeling of being in and at one with my body is pronounced. Higher dosing brings everything together so that I can't tell where I end and other things begin. It's meditative, comforting, and peaceful. It's also the psychic/mind reading isomer.Thoughts, words, sounds and lights combine to form a new language that is understood. OEVs can be outstanding. A living room can become the deck of a ship out at sea, or a stage with actors on it. It still maintains its overall form as a room though. Connections to external things are few. The world exists inside of me and I inside of it. Nothing to worry about. A pleasant come down ensues. 

An then there's R. R makes me get up and talk and walk. Things get done, seemingly by themselves, with my hands and body guided by an invisible cord that runs through me. I'm outside the normal flow of time and space now. My body is an object to be guided by my mind, which seems to reside elsewhere, at high doses everywhere.There is a great machine at work. I am both moving it as it moves me. It is external, yet I can feel it inside of me. Then I go for a ride. I'm in a series of passages, moving rapidly horizontally, then vertically. I'm communicating with the others that are there. I'm moving through the machine. The me I usually know is just one aspect of a transdimensional being. I can see the higher dimensional me at the controls, each frame of time flipping by. These are physical spaces. Extreme disorientation, complete depersonalization and derealization are pretty standard. Sometimes the great loopback happens. Everything is predetermined and has played out to this point. A life or death decision must be made. Was it the right choice? Coming back from a trip like that is always tough.

So there you have it. Most K is racemic. It contains both isomers in varying proportions so we usually get a taste of both. If I had to choose a favourite it would definitely be R.",,False,self,t5_2sk32,False,,,True,t3_15kkdw,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15kkdw/ketamine_2_drugs_in_one/,

 As most of you guys know, we as humans produce endogenous cannabinoid compounds, primarily anandamide.

Something that many of you may not know, is that when we consume oils and fats, some of the fatty acids are metabolized into fatty acid amides. Interestingly enough, many of these fatty acid amides (FAA) show activity at both cb1 and cb2 receptors in varying degrees.

One of the more well known of these amides is oleamide. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleamide)
""Oleamide is an amide of the fatty acid oleic acid. It is an endogenous substance: it occurs naturally in the body of animals. It accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid during sleep deprivation and induces sleep in animals.[2] It is being studied as a potential medical treatment for mood and sleep disorders, and cannabinoid-regulated depression.[3][4]""

Oleic acid is a main component of olive oil.
Oleic acid 56 grams (0.2 mole) and 36 grams (0.6 moles) urea are
mixed and rapidly heated to 230 degrees. The mixture is heated for two hours and then extracted with naphtha. The naphtha extract is washed
with water. 2 grams of activated carbon are added and then filtered off. More naphtha is added (eg. 75 mL. per 10 grams). The mixture is chilled (0 degrees C.) yields 40-50% oleamide. Pure ole amide can be obtained by repeated crystallizations from ethanol (30-40% yield).

This above reaction can be applied to the majority of fatty acids to provide the matching fatty acid amide. One may replace urea with isopropylamine, ethanolamine etc. to create the correlating FAA.

Fatty acid amide derivatives from DHA are a primary interest to me.
The simple amide, iso- and ethanol- amide variations are shown to be quite beneficial and potentially as potent as THC.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22959887

http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/9/1584.abstract
The omega-3 fatty acid ethanolamides, docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPEA), displayed greater anti-proliferative potency than their parent omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells. DHEA and EPEA activated cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors in vitro with significant potency, suggesting that they are endocannabinoids.

This is just a small introduction. More to come!

Many of you probably already know about how CYP3A4 metabolizes MDMA to MDA(which is transformed into the neurotoxic aMD). For my cake day I want want to look at 3 over the counter inhibitors of them and how they affect your roll. 

First we have white grapefruit juice, a well known potentiator of illicit substances which inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. if you take it before you drop you will end up having less MDMA metabolize to MDA and your roll will last about 10% longer. It is also a good way to restore those electrolytes while your rolling.

Second, we have Quercetin. A popular antioxidant combined with MDMA, it is a inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. it is also known to induce CYP3A4 so dont take it too early before you roll or you risk counteracting your efforts.

Third, We have Cimetidine a H2 receptor antagonist like Pepcid AC except sold as ""Tagamet"". It affects much more liver enzymes than the standard Famotidine and greatly lowers your stomach acid contents and thus potentiates MDMA heavily. It inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. This can alter your roll but Cimetidine's bioavalibility is quite low in an acidic environment so take it as you will.

Take what I say with a grain of salt, I take usually around 100mg of pure MDMA without redosing and am not at risk for many of the adverse effects associated with potentiating your roll too heavily. To cause serotonin syndrome with MAO-A inhibition or exciciotoxicity by increasing your blood levels of MDMA too greatly can be extremely dangerous. Please be careful.

Love,

I've had a great interest in psychoactives since I first read the wikipedia article on ""Levels of Psychedelic Experience"". Since then I've read countless trip reports, bluelight threads, news articles and of course reddit posts on various aspects of drugs and their effects. I am yet to experience any drugs apart from cannabis (I am very cautious and have been keen to research anything before taking it... that and I am in the midst of an exam period).

Now, however, I'm going to be coming into a lot of free time and am interested in getting a proper grounding in the science of it all (that is, beyond high-school biology and chemistry; and an amateur interest). Most of my interest lies in psychedelics/hallucinogens, but I understand the whole topic is interlinked. As far as I can discern, the main facets of ""drugs"" to be more aware of are:

* Neuroscience
- Here I already have a limited knowledge (i.e., understanding synaptic transmission, receptors, secondary messengers, competitive and non-competitive inhibitors, agonists and antagonists etc.) of the biology but I understand this is an important aspect. 

So far I have taken advantage of the free course materials available on MIT for introductions to neuroscience and cognitive science, Neuroscience and behaviour etc. - but what are the key parts of neuroscience for understanding the effects of psychoactives, and is there an easier or more comprehensive introduction to neuroscience available?

* Pharmacology
- So far I understand the role of similarities between neurotransmitters and psychoactives to an extent. I have read about affinity for receptors and ligands, where the 5-HT2A receptor seems most important in hallucinogens.

I am currently reading PiKHAL and TiKHAL (and found the Structural Tour of PiKHAL incredibly helpful on the chemistry side) but I am at a loss for how I can progress in pharmacology otherwise - so any useful materials would be greatly appreciated.

* Organic chemistry
- Here my school-level education is semi-useful... I know the real basic organic reactions and a little laboratory knowledge, but beyond that I'm not sure which parts are most relevant to psychoactives and their synthesis (I'm not interested in synthesising them myself, more in the relationships between molecules and most importantly the relationship of structure to function...)

I have again downloaded several course materials on synthesis and general organic chemistry, and Shulgin's work will doubtless prove very helpful. Again I can only ask for recommendations.

* Cultural/social/spiritual implications
- This is probably the most expansive section of all! I have read the Doors of Perception and Fear and Loathing... but would love to know what are considered the most seminal works are in the realm of psychedelia. I am interested in all the typical stuff, McKenna, John Lilly, Timothy Leary etc. but it often feels overwhelming.

TL;DR - Interested in psychoactives. How can I become properly educated in the matter?

Thanks for any and all of your suggestions or advice - as far as I can tell this is the best place to come for more specific information concerning drugs.

Also, it seems to increase D1 receptor density in the PFC, and yet there are many accounts of withdrawal accessible by a quick google search.

So I looked into it. I'll provide some basic conclusions from reviewing the literature on Pubmed and what I've concluded. It would be great if you could chime in since this drug is quite confusing (but also interesting, of course).

An abstract from probably the most interesting paper of sulbutiamine pharmacology, ""Evidence for a modulatory effect of sulbutiamine on glutamatergic and dopaminergic cortical transmissions in the rat brain"":

&gt;Chronic treatment of rats by **sulbutiamine induced no change in density of** N-methyl-d-aspartate (**NMDA**) **and** (±)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid [**AMPA**] receptors in the cingular cortex, but **a significant decrease of the kainate binding sites**, as measured by quantitative autoradiography. In the same treated animals, **an increase of D1 dopaminergic (DA) binding sites was measured both in the prefrontal and the cingular cortex, while no modification of the D2 binding sites was detected.** Furthermore, **an acute sulbutiamine administration induced a decrease of kainate binding sites but no change of the density of D1 and D2 DA receptors. Acute sulbutiamine injection led to a decrease of the DA levels in the prefrontal cortex** and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels in both the cingular and the prefrontal cortex. These observations are discussed in terms of a modulatory effect of sulbutiamine on both dopaminergic and glutamatergic cortical transmissions.

&gt;The decreased levels of DOPAC suggest a reduced release of DA in the prefrontal cortex. The increased density of D1 DA receptors 2 h following a chronic treatment (Fig. 2), may result from this chronic modification and its induced compensatory mechanisms. These mechanisms disappear with the interruption of the sulbutiamine treatment, no more modification of D1 binding sites being observed five days later (Fig. 2). A single injection of sulbutiamine should not be sufficient to change the D1 receptor density (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that changes of receptor sensitivity take place following a chronic change in the cortical dopaminergic transmission induced by sulbutiamine. Thus, the changes in density of kainate receptor in the cortex lead to suggest that sulbutiamine and/or its metabolites may modulate the cortical glutamatergic transmission. **In fact, the rapid decrease observed immediately following a single injection suggests a direct effect on the cortical glutamatergic transmission, for instance a modulation of the intra-synaptic glutamate concentration.** Cellular mechanisms responsible for the effects of sulbutiamine are unknown. Thiamine triphosphate, a derivative significantly enhanced in rat brain following an injection of sulbutiamine, could have modulatory effect on neuronal membrane permeability [2] and [3]. Such a modulation induces ionic changes, and further modulate the binding on kainate receptors. Changes on glutamatergic transmission could be at the origin of the modulation of dopaminergic cortical transmission. Indeed, numerous behavioural, anatomical and electrophysiological studies report the modulation of dopaminergic cortical transmission by glutamate, notably through kainate receptors [4], [8], [10] and [12]. On the contrary, chronic blockade of dopaminergic transmission by antipsychotic drugs does not change the density of cortical kainate binding sites, even though the expression of their mRNA is affected [6] and [13]. In the nucleus accumbens kainate receptors are down regulated without any significant change in dopaminergic transmission.
The interactions between dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmissions within the prefrontal cortex could play a pivotal role in the therapeutic action of sulbutiamine. Those results strongly support recent findings that demonstrate improvement in behavioural, cognitive, attentional and functional disorders in schizophrenic, alcoholic and depressed patients [5], [7] and [11]. Other experiments, including release and/or uptake studies, have to be conducted in order to further investigate the respective role of the cortical glutamatergic and dopaminergic cortical transmissions in the effect of sulbutiamine.

So from this first paper we have -

Modulation / ""direct effect"" on glutmate -?-&gt; Decrease in DA --&gt; Increase in D1 receptors

I can't tell whether the glutamatergic modulation is causing the drop in DA or if it's independent. But it seems since the effects on DA are more based on chronic usage and the kainate changes are virtually immediate that the glutamatergic effect may be causing the dopaminergic effects. And then there's the fact that AMPA and NMDA are not downregulated.

It seems to me from this mechanism that excitotoxicity is a concern.

Another abstract:

&gt;Thiamine deficiency in both man and animals is known to produce memory dysfunction and cognitive disorders which have been related to an impairment of cholinergic activity. The present experiment was aimed at testing whether, inversely, chronic administration of large doses of sulbutiamine would have a facilitative effect on memory and would induce changes in central cholinergic activity. Accordingly mice received 300 mg/kg of sulbutiamine daily for 10 days. They were then submitted to an appetitive operant level press conditioning test. When compared to control subjects, sulbutiamine treated mice learned the task at the same rate in a single session but showed greatly improved performance when tested 24 hr after partial acquisition of the same task. Parallel neurochemical investigations showed that **the treatment induced a slight (+ 10%) but significant increase in hippocampal sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake.** The present findings and previous results suggest that sulbutiamine improves memory formation and that this behavioral effect could be mediated by an increase in hippocampal cholinergic activity.

So sulbutiamine also increases choline uptake (ie increases ACh).

And one last abstract:

&gt;Cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activities and nycthemeral states of vigilance organization were studied in 6 adult rhesus monkeys during subchronic administration (10 days) of Sulbutiamin, a synthesized derivative of thiamine (300 mg/kg/day). Sulbutiamin induced the following modifications: (1) In the EEG activities: increase in occurrence of fast rhythms (over 28 c/sec) during waking and also during slow sleep (SS) in which their amplitude doubled. SS spindles increased in number and amplitude. (2) In vigilance organization: **waking was enhanced all along the 24 h recording and SS was reorganized (particularly at night), mostly light sleep: large decrease in stage 2 duration, increase in stage 1. REM sleep duration remained stable. These changes, occurring at around day 5 of the treatment, were more pronounced on day 10 and disappeared 2-5 days after withdrawal.** This study demonstrated the clear action of Sulbutiamin upon the mechanisms regulating waking and light sleep.

So it disrupts sleep. I can't tell if this is from the glutamatergic or dopaminergic mechanisms, although both seem plausible.

Warning: long/controversial post,30,3,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/19o3lz/questionsdiscussion_on_mdma_neurotoxicity_warning/,"I’m curious, what is the definition of MDMA-induced neurotoxicity in layman’s terms? Is this damage permanent? Does neurotoxicity refer to complete neuronal death or just peripheral damage to the neuron? 

Dr. Carhart-Harris wrote this in his AMA:

&gt;There's no known cell death with either drug (psilocybin vs. MDMA) but MDMA can damage serotonin cell fibres in large doses.

To clarify, I’m not looking for sources. I’m very aware of the underlying pharmacological science (MDMA metabolites are theorized to be neurotoxic). I own *Ecstasy: The Complete Guide*, I have B.S. in psychology (not pharmacology, but close enough), I participate in MAPS events, etc. etc., I’m just looking for a legitimate conversation on this topic between intellectuals aware of the science, without asking for sources. If we’re on this sub, we should be aware of the science, right? 

What I’m about to say is controversial and will be attacked, but hear me out:

I believe that MDMA-induced neuroxicity is overhyped on reddit. Every pharmaceutical and recreational drug I am aware of is neurotoxic. Yes, I am aware of the animal/human studies conducted with MDMA that demonstrate (or do not demonstrate) the harms of MDMA usage. For arguments sake, let’s assume that those studies are valid and unbiased. From a behavioral, or phenomenological standpoint, how much does moderate MDMA-usage *actually* affect MDMA users? How does it effect their daily life and functionality as a human? Furthermore, how does alcohol, marijuana, and psychedelics effect users in comparison to MDMA ? Not to mention, how does daily amphetamine usage effect little kids? 

I’ve encountered ‘e-tards’, I’ve also seen people who use MDMA every weekend and seem pretty with it. I’ve seen people who use shrooms/LSD on a weekly basis and seem completely out-of-it too. But let me pose this question, how much do we *really* know about the relationship between neuropharmacology and phenomenology?

I’ve talked multiple professors on this subject, and they’re pretty humble about it. I’m under the impression that we don’t *really know that much* about the connection between consciousness and neurochemistry. I mean, we know A LOT, but is it enough to make some of conclusions I see utilized in clinical practice and posted on science forums? This applies to all drugs, whether or not they are used therapeutically or recreationally. I just want to take a step back and look at what’s happening from all angles.

Step 1: take drug

Step 2: drug has effect on chemistry

Step 3: physiological response

But what determines the physiological response? Is free will involved? If it is, could free will intrinsically be related to biochemical levels of our being? Can we model free-will using attractor dynamics that show deterministic effects from future-present, thus under-mining the absolutism of causality from past-present? Thus completely altering our models of human-drug interactions?!!???

I don’t know. But if you were to use MDMA or 4-FA on a semi regular basis (once every week or two), and you never upped the dosage, and you were okay with the diminished effect, could your body *potentially* overcome the neurotoxic effects and protect your brain? Similar to how people exposed to other toxins can form defense mechanisms? If you no longer experience bruxism or hangovers, and you’re completely satisfied with the experience that you are maintaining at a constantly low dose level, and there are no notable behavioral effects that are affecting your life in any significant way, is it still bad to use the MDMA/4-FA more than once every 3 months? If the neuronal death is related to oxidative stress and hyperthermia, could you control this through using antioxidants and not overheating? Would you still experience neurotoxicity if you aren't overheating and not feeling a hangover and using supplements and not using a high dose?

**TLDR:** What is MDMA-neurotoxicity? Is it *really* that much worse than other drugs? How confident are you with our current knowledge of neuropharmacology? Is free-will worth considering in the equation? Can your body become resistant to the neurotoxic effects?

**Disclaimer:** I’m not trying to pick a fight, I’m not personally attacking any individuals. Please don’t down-vote if you disagree, I would rather you post why, or just say everything above is bullshit, because I really want to have a discussion on this topic. I won’t necessarily reply to comments that aren’t within the philosophical spirit, but I would prefer a rude reply over a down vote, just because I want people to see the discussion.

So I blasted off into hyperspace for the first time last night.  While it wasn't my first time smoking DMT, it was my first time truly breaking through.   

My experience is probably best described as the quintessential ego-death experience in that I became pure consciousness and forgot entirely that ""I"" exist.  

While at the height of my trip, there may have been something which could be described as this dancing, feminine entity, really I'm not sure given the level of disorientation I experienced.  I also wonder if I perhaps I am biased to impart that meaning on what I experienced, given that the presence of entities seems to be ubiquitous among DMT trip reports.   

This leads me to my question... While I am not trying to discredit what many people seem to experience (existence of alternative realities, spiritual realms, entities, etc.), I am merely looking for more empirical or scientific theories on what the DMT experience entails.   

While my experience was very interesting and I will very likely continue exploration into this head-space, all I can really say about it right now is ""What the fuck?""

1340217201.0,27,self.DrugNerds,vc9on,Hypothetical budget for a private lab,29,2,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/vc9on/hypothetical_budget_for_a_private_lab/,"So lets say that a serious drug geek strikes it rich ($100 million+) and wants to do something silly like try each chem in PiHKAL and TiHKAL (thats an xbox live achievement, right?) as well as being able to try whatever else sounds interesting. Lets say that a more or less bottomless budget is available and a large basement made available for conversion to a lab. 

The idea is that a personal chemist ought to be able to be hired to run such a lab, producing custom chems on demand. So some questions:

1) What kind of professional/educational background would the chemist need? I have 3 years of undergrad laboratory science so its not like I'm ignorant (I can read Shulgin's recipes and understand what he's doing), but I assume I need someone with PhD level or industry experience? While I don't have time/interest in being the chemist, is this stuff that an enthusiastic/intelligent/geeky/stubborn lay-person could figure out with the right aptitudes?

2) How willing would such a chemist likely be to take such an offer? If the lab is for personal use there would only be whatever salary was paid since there would be no piles of drug money. Also no prestige from publishing. How rare are people this good? I get the feel that a lot of illicit chemists are second tier. Does the underground simply not appeal to the best chemists?

3) Assuming there was no drug selling or trafficking how secure could it be? Other than sourcing controlled precursors (not a problem really, with enough funding one could simply own a chem supply company) would a large basement lab capable of synthing anything be able to be small enough to not raise any red flags in terms of waste/power/water consumption? 

4) Any idea of costs to get requisite equipment? Looking at Shulgin's recipes it looks like a few dozen grand would be sufficient for all equipment, but are there some extravagant costs hidden somewhere I'm missing?

5) The weird question: does a chemist have to ""get"" psychedelics to do it right. There is this somewhat mystical idea that not all LSD-25 is the same and that you might not actually know what 2C-B is unless you got it from someone who ""made it with love"" like Shulgin or Owsley. You can never convince the old hippies that anything but Owsley or Sandoz is actually acid.

Every 5-10 years outbreaks would occur, killing thousands or sometimes even tens of thousands of people.
This got me thinking what the evolutionary effect of this would be. It seems Europeans with low resistance to ergot alkaloids were being selected against during the middle ages; ergot poisoning was often fatal, and also affected all age groups, so those susceptible frequently died before reproduction. So those who could resist the disease would live and pass on their genes and all would be swell. Due to frequent outbreaks, this force of selection was acting on Europeans for centuries.

The most significant instances would be the outbreaks that occurred following the Bubonic Plague. The massive amounts of deaths (20% or something like that) resulted in a bottleneck effect on the European populations; the gene pool lost much of its diversity. Following the plague, population recovered much slower than would be expected. It is now believed this recovery lag was due to an outbreak of Ergot poisoning, which killed enough to keep the population from increasing for decades. With the Black Plague wiping out so many and creating a bottleneck, and then ergot poisoning selecting for the resistant ones left in the smaller population, the evolutionary effects (increased resistance) would occur more rapidly and be more significant.

What effect would this have on the population as a whole? I would think that it would cause Europeans, over several centuries would have evolved higher resistance to ergot alkaloids. Their bodies could process them in slightly different but significant ways. Alkaloids like, say, LSD. Perhaps Europeans have a higher resistance to LSD, or experience the trip in a different way, their bodies perhaps processing it slightly differently. I don't know, just a thought I have been playing with in my head, any thoughts?

**tl;dr Are Europeans more naturally resistant to LSD due to evolutionary forcings?**

We've all heard the general advice of not re-dosing on mdma to minimize any potential harmful after effects.  It makes sense but is it the act of just 'taking more' that could cause issues, or is it the actual time separation?

So the example.  You take an initial 120mg dose, and then a subsequent 60mg dose an hour or so later for a grand total of 180mg.  

Vs.

One initial dose of 180mg.  

Are they equally 'bad' or does the subsequent dosage cause more complications than one large initial dose?  If so, why?

My friends had tripped on the same tabs before. I thought that it would be no big deal, that I just hasn't taken enough. 

My last psychedelic experience prior to this was 1.5g shrooms, well over a month before.

However, one month later I took two tabs of acid, and had the exact same thing: an uncomfortable comeup an inability to get high from weed. My friends tripped moderately. I didn't know what was going on.

A month again after that, I took 4g shrooms and experienced THE SAME THING again. No trip, a couple hours of body lightness and anxiety, then nothing. A friend took 3g of the same shrooms and tripped balls.

Two months later, I took three tabs of acid and once again did not trip, whereas my friend tripped intensely. I actually got visual distortions this time, which lasted for around 15 minutes. I ate a 100mg THC edible two hours in, which should have completely floored me. I felt more sober than ever, except for having extreme short memory loss. 

I am losing hope. Psychedelics are so important to me.

EDIT: I AM DUMB http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23845561

I appreciate that we need to understand the neurotoxicity of these novel psychostimulants but walking into an experiment armed with the hypothesis that these chemicals cause brain damage from the get go seems terribly biased and preserving that hypothesis after collecting data pointing to lack of neurotoxicity is at best perplexing and at worst unscrupulous. The insistence that simply because neurosis was not exhibited in dopamine nerve endings in the striatum means it could be toxic elsewhere in the brain is presumptuous. The final proposed neurotoxic mechanism is prolonged vasoconstriction from binge use of the stimulants, resulting reduced blood flow to certain areas of the brain or as they phrase it  ""altered cerebral hemodynamics."" 

Whatever, don't abuse analogues of controlled substances this should be obvious to basically everybody. Further, don't hoof baggies of white powder from a gas station and expect zero consequences.

So... in my eyes this is a win-win, if the null hypothesis proves true the benefits are obvious but the contrary paints a truly sobering irony; the threshold between recreational over-stimulation and chemically induced neurosis will be determined and exceeded; then simply because this neurotoxic threshold can be broken it will be lauded as evidence to countless laymen that it theses compounds are brain dissolving super-toxins worthy of the strictest regulation. This quite succinctly shows that the war on drugs has resulted in the creation of substances who's neurotoxicity is ""profoundly"" more so than the psychoactive compounds they are intended to supersede/stand in for. Why on earth is evidence like this ignored when considering national drug policy; how can this not clearly expose The War on Drugs as a catastrophic blunder with profoundly negative social consequences? It is absurd and vexing to see ignorance tirelessly prevail.

I confidently assert that the reality of a compound having a neurotoxic threshold does not necessarily mean it is neurotoxic at its psychoactive threshold, will be cleverly ignored and its ""profound"" capacity for neurosis vociferously proclaimed; the alarming side effects encountered at neurotoxic doses will be spun as consistent with safe (read intelligent/responsible) levels of consumption. Cathinone analogues will become molecular pariahs, a fate likely translated to their small base of recreational users.

The most glaring irregularity is the missing baseline neuroprofile (idk what else to call it) of Miles (a human bio-assay), this is crucial data for comparison. Binge poly-substance abusers (like Miles) typically exhibit measurable neurological deficiencies and a co-morbid psychiatric condition will already manifest with neurological maladies of its own.... it is a serious oversight to not include these variables in a final decision of any compounds neurotoxicity. Bio-assays gleaned  from this or similar sources come with a great deal of 'noise' making correlation suspect and causation impossible to deduce.

Naturally, the study fails to find evidence for Bath-Salts induced neurosis but continues to insinuate serious neurotoxicity may take place in other areas of the brain.

Maybe I am huge ignorant jerk but it seems to me that this is a lot of scary jargon and not much evidence to back it up. Sure, to much MDPV will induce some pretty extreme cases of stimulant psychosis as will /any stimulant overdose/.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history in stroke therapy and its therapeutic efficacy has been confirmed by clinical studies. The molecular basis of the neuroprotective effects is unknown. We wondered whether or not the neuroprotective effect of TCMs might be due to their N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist properties. We used the patch-clamp technique to screen 22 TCM stroke drugs for NMDAR antagonist activity in cultured cortical neurons. The drugs were also screened for their ability to abate NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. Aqueous extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis, Stephania tetrandra, and Salvia miltiorrhiza blocked currents induced by NMDA (200 microM, 10 microM glycine, 0 Mg2+) at a holding potential of -80 mV by 83.45+/-4.34, 38.65+/-7.50, and 52.97+/-1.78%, respectively. The block of the NMDA-evoked currents was voltage-dependent and showed a negative slope conductance reminiscent of Mg2+. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry revealed the presence of 12.5, 2, and 8.7 mM Mg2+ in the extracts of S. baicalensis,S. tetrandra, and S. miltiorrhiza, respectively. None of these extracts blocked NMDA-induced neuronal death. The Uncaria rhynchophylla extract blocked NMDA-evoked currents by 54.98+/-8.61% even at +60 mV and reduced NMDA-induced neuronal death by 59.13+/-3.52%. NMDAR antagonist activity may underlie the neuroprotective effects of this TCM. Some TCM drugs may exert therapeutic effects due to their Mg2+ content.

As a side note, Uncaria rhynchophylla is a very interesting plant. With a phytochemical make-up much similar to Kratom in many ways, it also acts as a semi-potent MAO-B inhibitor in addition to it's NMDA antagonist properties!

[Fixed],29,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/1h8p9z/psychedelic_methylchavicol_found_in_sweet_basil/,"*Sorry if I'm including too much speculation or I've violated another rule, but this is my first non-drunk post here :P*
Today I stumbled onto some information regarding psychoactive basil oil. It's rather old, but I can't find any other info on the subject. According to the post author:
&gt;I’ve ingested up to 10 drops of sweet basil oil containing about 70% methyl chavicol. The effects start in about 30 minutes and seem to peak after 90 minutes. Overall the effects last a few hours. It’s mild at that dose. It’s relaxing, mildly euphoric, and mildly psychedelic. Did I type “psychedelic”? Yes, that’s right, at 10 drops for me it is mildly psychedelic. I experienced very mild visuals from it at that dose. This is actually not too surprising. Methyl chavicol (para-methoxyallyl benzene) is very closely related to PMA (also known as para-methoxyamphetamine, 4-methoxyamphetamine, or 4-MA) which is a known psychedelic amphetamine sometimes sold as MDMA.

&gt;Apparently methyl chavicol, like elemicin, is metabolized by CYP1A2. With elemicin, it was found that 5+ grams of German chamomile (a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor) greatly potentiates the effects of elemicin, making it both stronger and more psychedelic. It’s possible that German chamomile might have a similar affect with methyl chavicol.

[source](http://herbs.mxf.yuku.com/topic/3784181#.Uc2YdbWcWSq)

Now, PMA is pretty nasty stuff from what I read on Wikipedia. The subjective reports on the forum seem far more ""acid like.""
The more psychedelic color of methylchavicol leads me to believe that there might be some 5HT agonist activity happening, rather than reuptake inhibition as with PMA.

//Edit: Damn formatting

I've found a wiki page on the subject, a lot of which is speculative, but interesting nevertheless.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/14mc0n/what_are_the_components_of_mdma_neurotoxicity_and/

From what I've read MDMA induced neurotoxicity consists from the following:

* Oxidation damage due to dopamine being absorbed into serotonin releasing cells. I believe I got this from a neuroimaging study.

Irreversible, but easy to prevent with anti-oxidants and a normal body temperature.

* Reduced SERT (5-HTT)-channel activity. David Erritzoe's neuroimaging study had pretty cool data on this including how it relates to dose and usage frequency.

Changes back over time except for in the neocortex. Unpreventable but dose and frequency dependable.

* Downregulation (is this the same as tolerance?) of your DA and 5-HTxy receptors

The sensitivity of your 5-HTxy receptors returns to baseline after ~7 days and you can't really prevent this either. I can't remember where I read this though.

I assume that the oxidation damage and downregulation (on the DA receptors) phenomena that are common in MDMA, amphetamine *and* methamphetamine as they all work as dopamine releasing agents and methamphetamine is relatively pretty neurotoxic because it releases a shitload of dopamine. Are there more things to these compounds?

And how often is too often?,28,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/12yi75/how_to_minimise_risks_of_mdma_and_how_often_is/,"Hello all, I am a 22 y/o female trying to avoid self-fuckuppery while still having a good time. Any advice would be great.

So I took MDMA for the first time three months ago and I've taken it twice since then spaced about a month apart. By the third time I had read a bit around it and was taking after preloading piracetam, taking vitamin C at the same time and 5-HTP afterwards. Clearly MDMA is great and I want to keep taking it but I thought I should nail down how to do it as safely as possible before continuing.

After reading these two posts:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/12v5f8/research_suggests_no_neurotoxicity_in_mdma/
http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/12x0a1/pre_and_postloading_supplements_dosage_and_timing/

I am going to bring in green tea, magnesium glycinate, alpha lipoic acid and all of the recommended antioxidants/etc mentioned to try and combat damage as much as possible and make sure body temperature is kept down.

So here are some questions:
How can you keep down body temperature in a hot club environment? Does having ice water really help - doesn't suddenly putting something really cold inside you shock the system a bit, or does that not really matter? How can you tell if you are overheating too much? What is the highest ""safe"" temperature? If you make sure to go and cool off every half hour or so and periodically drink water, is that enough?

How often is too often and how much is too much? I'm getting the impression that 150mg is as low and safe as you can go and 500mg is insanity? I think the first time I took it it was about 300mg so that was probably far too much. Hypothetically, would taking 400mg every two months be more harmful than taking 200mg every month?

Is every month too often? I keep reading that a month is like the minimum recovery time... but if you were doing it repeatedly, once a month, would that start to batter you?

Am I too young to be doing this now? I'm not expecting a solid answer on this from anyone... but I have read that the brain continues to develop well into your 20s and I am still only 22. I remember deciding that if I was ever going to get heavily into smoking pot I would leave it until after the age of 25 for this reason - could the same logic be applied to MDMA?

If you take all of the supplements and antioxidants and keep doses/body temperature low etc... would you expect zero neurotoxicity/tolerance buildup or still a small amount?

[This graph shows this effect more clearly](http://i.imgur.com/wj1ZC.png)

Now LSD is obviously an anomaly in this case but as you can see the less potent a psychedelic is vs. its binding efficacy the more PLC it releases (aka DOB: low binding efficacy but high agonist properties). LSD on the other hand has high bonding efficacy but low activation profiles. Most people will agree that LSD is less effective at causing HPPD than phenethylamine psychedelics such as 2C-E and that LSD cases of HPPD occur mainly due to its prevalence as one of the most commonly used psychedelics.

My theory is this: due to the unusual mechanism of Phospholipase release arising from psychedelic use and the partial depletion of these acids the receptor causes irregularities when they are replenished. To simplify this:

Normal serotonin activation of 5HT2a produces (rough guess) release of 60% PLC and 40% PLa2.

Say a Psychedelic binds and releases 75% of the PLC but only 10% of the PLa2. So upon replenishment more PLC is produced to account for the increased activation. The balance in the receptor is now 61% PLC and 39% PLa2. When serotonin activates it a more psychedelic style activation occurs than before producing HPPD symptoms. More selective releasers will change the balance more heavily. Upon continued activation by ""normal"" agonists (serotonin) this balance returns to normal hence a reduction in HPPD symptoms. 

This theory also accounts for why Benzodiazapenes and antipsychotics reduce HPPD symptoms. Benzos directly affect glutamate levels in the cortex oppositely from a psychedelic effect so would reduce unusual excitation. Antipsychotics work in an opposite fashion on 5HT2A receptors to psychedelics so will redress the balance of phospholipases in a inverse fashion.

I'll continue to elaborate on my theory if people show interest.",,False,self,t5_2sk32,False,,,True,t3_pndo3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/pndo3/hppd_mechanism_speculation/,

&gt;the antidepressant and increased locomotor activity relies on both R- and S-phenotropils, but the memory-improving activity is only characteristic of R-phenotropil.

This makes sense, since the benzene ring off the phenylethylamine structure is the same in both enantiomers. I postulate that the norepinephrine and dopamine affinities come from the benzene side of the molecule, and the NMDA modulation comes from the piracetam side with the open amine group.

~~[This is what I believe the R and S isomers look like.](http://i.imgur.com/G1Igp6F.png)~~

[Perhaps this.](http://i.imgur.com/D5czvf4.png)

[This site](http://chemmol.com/chemmol/49423077.html) says that C5 is the chiral center, so my picture should be accurate. (I am not certain my S and R labels are correct, though)

Since the stimulant/anti depressant effects are present in both isomers, but the memory enhancement is only present in the R, I think it's safe to postulate that the NE and DA effects are from the benzene side. This would also explain why the methylenedioxy ring on MDMA reduces the substances affinity for DA in comparison to methamphetamine. It also fits with 6-APB having a higher DA affinity than MDMA. The benzofuran ring has one less oxygen atom than the methylenedioxy ring, which causes the substance to have a higher DA affinity and less 5-HT affinity. The benzene is what has NE and DA affinities.

I am not a chemist, so these are just postulations at this point. Does anyone see any holes with my thinking?

I've been trying to stop lately and am suffering from fatigue and anhedonia. This I believe is a result of my frequent but therapeutic amphetamine use. The fatigue has been ever present in my life and is basically the reason I faked ADD to get my script, because of this it's difficult to know what baseline is. As for the anhedonia, it's also always been present in my life to a certain degree though I feel it's gotten worse. 

Because of these two symptoms I'm tempted to take the odd amphetamine tablet, maybe a total of about 15mg of dextroamphetamine a week just so I can have some hours where I want to socialize and get things done. I understand it is a difficult thing to quantify but I'm curious if someone could give me an idea of how bad this is for the recovery of my brains dopamine system.

For anyone curious, my drug use was essentially, MDMA once a month, weed anywhere from 1-6 nights a week, 100-200mg of dextroamphetamine a week, 20mg of valium a week, 100mg of ketamine a week, psychedelics once a fortnight, 35mg of OC or 100mg of heroin once a month. Most of that, bar the MDMA was alone. I've stopped taking all drugs alone and in the past week have only done a tiny bit of coke, puff of weed, 100mg of ketamine and 2 bars of xanax. Which is still a lot but it's a drastic reduction from taking some form of drug every day. And it's still my first week of adjusting to not using drugs, I am to get better though expect I will always use some form of drug once a week or so.

I hypothesized baclofen may help with amphetamine dependence, and promised an update in 2 weeks.

Well, it's been 4 weeks now. The results? Well, after a week long regimen, my PDOC cut me off after deciding the experiment was a liability. Not exactly how I envisioned this going. I had a long post, but it's not much data. In short, the baclofen administered WITH the vyvanse, by the third day, was showing signs of removing my typical craving in the afternoon, preceding the crash. When I took it I felt the same euphoria and stimulation, need to move, etc, but by the fifth day I actually forgot to take my morning dose- and upon this realization, I didn't rush back in to take it. Interestingly enough, on the last day, I didn't feel the need for even the coffee I typically drink in the morning.

Remarkably, I didn't experience any heavy modulation of the experience of the drug itself, but after several days of taking them concurrently, I just didn't feel like craving to take the vyvanse anymore. I still thought about doing it, but it wasn't an overriding compulsion anymore.

I'd love to try the experiment again, but my doctor is a little wary. Not altogether too surprising, honestly. But at the very least baclofen gave me the kick in the ass to get back into running and now that's serving to alleviate the cravings.

So there it is, not much, but I thought you guys might enjoy that little unscientific tidbit. Perhaps GABAa agonists have potential for addiction attenuation?

Paxil had severe side effects for me, and within a month I switched over to Zoloft. For eight years up until I was 20, I was on Zoloft. My dosages began at 15mg and ended at 50mg daily. Throughout this period, I felt zombified. I had no emotions and was cruising through high school with complete detachment. Once I turned 18, I began smoking weed and I absolutely loved it. I felt wholesome, complete, and euphoric. I could smoke on a daily basis and it made me feel real again.

Once I turned 20, I stopped taking Zoloft cold turkey on my own will. Those two months were definitely some of the wildest withdrawals I have ever had, but I persevered and have since felt whole again. However, when I smoke weed sober now even many years later, I get intense anxiety, paranoia, tenseness, and agitation. The only way I can counter this is if I have a benzodiazepene or am under the influence of a heavy amount of alcohol. Because I stay away from benzos due to addiction potential and only drink heavily on occasion, I have simply stopped smoking.

What I find odd, though, is my ability to take psychedelics. I typically take high doses (~4-600ug) of LSD and have complete DMT breakthroughs, yet I experience zero of the same negative side effects as weed. I find this odd because how powerful these substances are in comparison to weed. I have read quite a few anecdotal claims of previous SSRI users who stopped and were unable to smoke weed yet use psychedelics with ease as well. Can anyone shed some light on the possibilities of this phenomena and possible contraindications?

Apparently it was formerly used as an anesthetic, and has many of the effects of ethanol.  It is around 20x as strong as ethanol.   

Some of the people claimed it had a more euphoric nature than alcohol without the nausea or as bad of a hangover.  Opinions differed slightly on the hangover from nonexistence to a spaciness the next morning.  Either way it was a lot easier to deal with than ethanol.

Clear dangers were overdose and addiction potential.

When it came to discussing the carcinogenic effects it seemed to get a little vague, I wasnt sure if anyone here could help with that.

In pursuit of a GABA(A) alpha5-subtype-selective inverse agonist to enhance cognition, a series of 6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophen-4(5H)-ones has been identified as a novel class of GABA(A) receptor ligands. These thiophenes have higher binding affinity for the GABA(A) alpha5 receptor subtype compared to the GABA(A) alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 subtypes, and several analogues exhibit high GABA(A) alpha5 receptor inverse agonism. 6,6-Dimethyl-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)thio-1-(thiazol-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophen-4(5H)-one (43) has been identified as a full inverse agonist at the GABA(A) alpha5 receptor and is functionally selective over the other major GABA(A) receptor subtypes. 43 readily penetrates into the CNS to give selective occupancy of GABA(A) alpha5 receptors. In addition, 43 enhances cognitive performance in rats in the delayed 'matching-to-place' Morris water maze test-a hippocampal-dependent memory task-without the convulsant or proconvulsant activity associated with nonselective, GABA(A) receptor inverse agonists.",,False,self,t5_2sk32,False,,,True,t3_1hf23v,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/1hf23v/α5ia_gabaa_inverse_agonist_that_enhances/,

I wish I could reproduce this state all of the time without having to drink ( and face the hangover). How could one do this? Anyone else get this feeling?

Some of you may make the comparison to amphetamine or methylphenidate. However, this post-drinking feeling is different than the feeling of taking some ritalin or adderall. For one, it lacks the dopamine ""buzz"". Also, I don't get the urge to tap my foot or drum my fingers or clean my room or anything like that. There is a similarity in that this feeling and ritalin/adderall produce quicker thought processes and more fluid conversation though.

My theory on how it works is that alcohol potentates the effects of GABA, which is of course an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The day after drinking, the brain is desensitized to GABA, which puts the brain in ""overdrive"", until GABA responsiveness returns to baseline levels. It may also have to do with dopamine. Thoughts?

* Abstract:

&gt;Cannabis use typically begins during adolescence and early adulthood, a period when cannabinoid receptors are still abundant in white matter pathways across the brain. However, few studies to date have explored the impact of regular cannabis use on white matter structure, with no previous studies examining its impact on axonal connectivity. The aim of this study was to examine axonal fibre pathways across the brain for evidence of microstructural alterations associated with long-term cannabis use and to test whether age of regular cannabis use is associated with severity of any microstructural change. To this end, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and brain connectivity mapping techniques were performed in 59 cannabis users with longstanding histories of heavy use and 33 matched controls. Axonal connectivity was found to be impaired in the right fimbria of the hippocampus (fornix), splenium of the corpus callosum and commissural fibres. Radial and axial diffusivity in these pathways were associated with the age at which regular cannabis use commenced. Our findings indicate long-term cannabis use is hazardous to the white matter of the developing brain. Delaying the age at which regular use begins may minimize the severity of microstructural impairment.

1337131810.0,18,self.DrugNerds,tp7w0,Reduction of Nausea Resulting from Psychedelic Drugs,19,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/tp7w0/reduction_of_nausea_resulting_from_psychedelic/,"I love psychedelic drugs, but at least for me, there is a serious downside in their use: persistent, moderate to severe nausea. I have experienced nausea virtually every time I have ever tripped. I've scoured the internet for ways to ameliorate this unfortunate effect, but I've had only limited success. So /r/DrugNerds, I come to you to ask for help, and also to start a discussion on the relationship between psychedelics and nausea. What conclusions follow are of my own reckoning, and I am no expert. If you disagree with something, please say so.

The pathophysiology of nausea and vomiting is very complex, and there are a lot of different pathways in the brain whose activation can lead to these. However, it seems to me that the main causes for nausea and vomiting from psychedelic drugs are dopaminergic or serotonergic in origin, either by release or reuptake inhibition of these neurotransmitters, or direct agonism of D2 or 5HT3 receptors. One of the most commonly mentioned 'cures' for psychedelic nausea is antihistamine antiemetics such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), or promethazine. However, these have not been succesful for me, and logically, it's unclear how much of an effect they should have, since they do not directly affect the pro-emetic pharmacological actions of psychedelics. Additionally, antihistamines have their own psychoactive effects, which can negatively impact the psychedelic experience, making them a poor candidate for treating psychedelic nausea.

It seems that the best way to prevent nausea from psychedelics would be to block the 5HT3 or D2 receptors. There are several pharmaceutical drugs that are used for this purpose, such as ondansetron (Zofran), which is a 5HT3 antagonist, and metoclopramide, which is a comibination 5HT3/D2 antagonist and 5HT4 agonist. However, it is unclear whether these drug would have any negative interactions with psychedelic drugs (though if it is true that ondansetron has ONLY an antagonist action at 5HT3, I can't imagine that it would have any negative interactions). Also, I do not know if these drugs have any palpable psychoactivity. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure that at least in the U.S., none of these are available over-the-counter, further limiting their use for this purpose.

There are other 5HT3 antagonists which can be found from natural sources, which I have used to limited success. Ginger root is a well known anti-emetic, and contains galanolactone, which is a 5HT3 antagonist, as well as other bioactives which may act as anti-emetics in some way. Essential oil of lemon also may have anti-emetic effects, due to the presence of beta-pinene, which is a 5HT3 antagonist. There are many other folk remedies for nausea that may rely in part on antagonism of these receptors, many of which I have not tried. In my experience, ginger and lemon oil are very hit-or-miss when used to treat psychedelic nausea. However, it is unclear to me that I have found a consistent way of ingesting these in a way which allows me to absorb the necessary bioactives, or that I have found ginger or lemon oil products which have the necessary quantity of bioactives. I do not know of any places where I could successfully purchase pure galanolactone or beta-pinene.

Can anyone else comment on the efficacy of any of the drugs I have mentioned, or note if there are any other drugs I am overlooking? Additionally, does anyone have any ideas for what pharmacological characteristics the ideal drug to use in treating psychedelic nausea would have? For instance, might other serotonin receptors be very important in the physiology of nausea? In that case, a less selective serotonin receptor antagonist might be best, but then perhaps it must be peripheral, in order to preserve the psychedelic's action in the brain.",,False,self,t5_2sk32,False,,,True,t3_tp7w0,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/tp7w0/reduction_of_nausea_resulting_from_psychedelic/,

Discussion should be kept to a Neurological basis, please no anecdotes or unscientific terminology such as ""Buzz"" etc. 

I'll get the ball rolling:

The main topics I can think of off the top of my head are:

* NMDA sensitization of dopamine system - 

NMDA antagonists such as DXM (of special interest due to its voltage independent action at NMDA), Magnesium and Memantine appear to upregulate/sensitize Dopamine receptors, reducing tolerance to DA releasers but also theoretically potentiating them. 

* AMPA modulation e.g. Piracetam - 

Many people report Piracetam to boost the effects of MDMA. I'm not familiar with the effects of AMPA modulation in the brain so maybe someone can fill in? 

* 5-HTP preloading - 

Preloading 5-HTP was proven [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7934616) to reduce neurotoxicity, but higher vesicular storage of Serotonin should increase the effectiveness of MDMA? Or will production be downregulated to compensate?

* Monoamine release balancing - 

Although not personally familiar with these compounds some people report improved euphoria from MDA and Mephedrone over MDMA. This could be due to superior monoamine release ratios. Perhaps with balancing by SRA/DRAs the positive euphoriant effects of MDMA could be improved?

* Gastrointestinal Ph levels -

I cannot find a study, but alkali stomach conditions are reported to improve Phenethylamines potency by better facilitating intestinal absorption.

Reading about it and this passage sums it up nicely.

A person takes a very small dose, 1-4 mg at night, they sleep though its effects, it blocks the receptors in the same way but only for several hours. the body makes all its endorphins at night while we sleep, as these receptors are blocked they signal the body to produce a lot more as there's no feed back, then the drugs effects pass, those receptors are unregulated and the amount of endorphins in the system is vastly increased for the next 24 hours.

These endorphins are the controllers of the immune system, its being used off label for autoimmune diseases, cancers, parkisons, MS, depression, chronic fatigue etc etc with good results, increases libido/sensitivity, and general life experience is deeper, think runners high yet with no drug like effects/negatives.

I've been reading through *[Ecstasy: The Complete Guide](http://www.erowid.org/library/books/ecstasy_complete.shtml)* by Julie Holland, and thought it might be good to share an excerpt from the chapter called ""Does MDMA cause brain damage?"", which is available at [Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_neurotoxicity1.shtml). According to the lede, ""This article, written in early 2001, is the best currently available overview of MDMA neurotoxicity.... Mattew Baggott's [the co-author] article on neurotoxicity was written as he was finishing his truly epic MDMA literature review published by [MAPS](http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/) as part of their work to explore MDMA as a potential therapeutic agent.""

**Potential Strategies for Reducing Risk of Neurotoxicity in Clinical Settings**

&gt;Because the range of psychoactive but non-neurotoxic MDMA doses appears narrow in most species and the possible long-term consequences of neurotoxicity are unknown, researchers and therapists may wish to consider strategies for reducing risk of neurotoxicity. For example, although high ambient temperature and humidity are unlikely in clinical settings, it is probably worth noting that these factors may increase body temperature, which is associated with increased MDMA neurotoxicity in rats. 

**tl;dr: MDMA has a narrow dosing range where its effects are non-neurotoxic; neurotoxicity increases with rising body temperatures.**

&gt;In addition, MDMA dose and frequency of administration could be kept to the minimum required. Even if they do not produce measurable neurotoxicity, all active doses of MDMA likely cause some degree of oxidative stress in the brain. Furthermore, the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of MDMA suggest that small increases in dose may lead to large increases in plasma MDMA levels (de la Torre, 2000; Mas, 1999) and, possibly, risk of neurotoxicity. Administration of a small 'booster' dose to lengthen MDMA intoxication may also increase risk, given the apparently saturable metabolism of MDMA. The possible benefits of such 'booster' doses should be carefully weighted against this risk.

**tl;dr: Even non-neurotoxic doses likely put stress on the brain; a small increase in dose (including booster doses) can cause a large increase in body MDMA concentration and lead to neurotoxicity.**

&gt;Anecdotal reports suggest that many ecstasy users are already employing pharmacological interventions that have been found to be neuroprotective in rodent MDMA studies. These interventions include antioxidants, SSRIs, and 5-hydroxytryptophan. Because rodent studies demonstrating neuroprotection have almost exclusively used multiple injections of high doses of neuroprotective agents, it is not always clear that humans can achieve comparable neuroprotection with oral dosing. This is particularly in question for vitamin C, which has saturable absorption and increased clearance after high doses in humans (Blanchard, 1997; Graumlich, 1997). Similarly, rodent studies using 5-hydroxytryptophan typically co-administer another drug to decrease peripheral metabolism of 5-hydroxytryptophan, allowing more to reach the brain. Oral administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan in humans therefore may not achieve adequate brain levels.

**tl;dr: Neurotoxicity-reduction strategies already in use include the use of antioxidants; SSRIs; and 5-HTP. These agents have been shown to work when injected directly into rats' brains; however it is not clear if oral doses in humans can provide equivalent protection. This is especially the case for vitamin C and 5-HTP.**

&gt;Keeping in mind the almost complete lack of controlled studies examining these interventions in humans, some seem sufficiently promising to warrant further consideration when designing protocols. Administering an SSRI when subjective MDMA effects have become minimal could be considered. Liechti (2000) has shown that pretreatment with 40 mg of the SSRI, citalopram, decreases the effects of l.5 mg/kg MDMA. This study demonstrates that these drugs can be co-administered safely in a clinical setting, despite a previous case report describing a possible adverse interaction between these compounds (Lauerma, 1998). Thus, giving an SSRI at 3 or 4 hours after MDMA administration could be considered if MDMA pharmacokinetics are not being measured and SSRIs are not otherwise contraindicated in the relevant patient or volunteer population.

**tl;dr: There are NO controlled studies examining the effects of the aforementioned strategies in humans, but some show promise. Taking an SSRI to reduce the effects of MDMA 3-4 hours after it is dosed has been demonstrated to be safe in a clinical setting, assuming no other contraindications in the patient.**

&gt;Antioxidant supplements may also prove useful. Aguirre (1999) reported that twice daily administration of high dose alpha-lipoic acid for two days completely blocked the neurotoxicity of a subsequent single dose of MDMA in rats. Because the acute inactivation of TPH can occur after non-neurotoxic MDMA doses and is due to oxidative stress, it is plausible that antioxidants may also enhance recovery from even low MDMA doses. One consideration with antioxidants is that high doses of some acids, such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), may alter urinary pH and thus affect excretion of MDMA. Aside from such possible pharmacokinetic interactions, doses of antioxidants that are known to be well tolerated appear unlikely to increase risk of adverse events and may decrease risks of chronic toxicity.

**tl;dr: Supplementation with high doses of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to block MDMA neurotoxicity in rats. Doses of antioxidants that are known to be well tolerated may decrease the risk of chronic toxicity.**

&gt;Although these potentially neuroprotective strategies are worth considering, appropriate doses and timing are largely unknown. It would furthermore be technically and ethically difficult to establish whether a given intervention has been successful in reducing MDMA neurotoxicity. These interventions should therefore be considered experimental and not be used to reassure potential volunteers that the risks of MDMA neurotoxicity are reduced. 

**tl;dr: These strategies are worth considering, but appropriate timing and doses are largely UNKNOWN. Keep in mind that these are experimental techniques and that their efficacy is difficult to establish at this time.**

What I take from this excerpt is that the some of these harm-mitigation strategies show a good deal of promise but no should assume that there's some combination of drug-supplement administration that will allow you to roll—even in moderation—without any risk to your brain's health. These drugs tax our brains and bodies and we should always be aware of the nature and magnitude of the risks associated with taking them, risks which will never completely go away.

The amount of Muscimol and/or Mescaline on the blotters would obviously be sub-threshold so alone would cause little to no effect unless many were taken at once. However the dose of LSD on one tab is fairly average reported to be 70-90ug, definitely enough to produce at least a ++ experience. One tab is said to also have either 100ug/100ug of Muscimol/Mescaline or just 200ug of Muscimol.

On one tab most users report a strange but overall weak LSD-like experience. On 3-4 tabs users report a strong LSD-like experience with numbness, dissociation, stimulation, anxiolytic, increased body load, increased visuals similar to those of mescaline, among many other things that are generally unlike pure LSD or any known RC. The strange effects are reported to be consistent with threshold effects of Muscimol and/or Mescaline. Multiple people have independently confirmed this, and these tabs come from a highly reputable source.

Has anyone here ever heard of this mixture or tried it? I am very interested in hearing people's opinions on how this could or could not work pharmacodynamically. 

My hypothesis is that LSD helps to sensitize postsynaptic 5HT2AR and 5HT2CR to the effects of mescaline, dramatically increasing the potency and producing threshold effects that are just barely noticeable. Muscimol is also a psychedelic gabaergic, which alters neuronal activity and possibly increases brain synchronization.

Let me start off with the fact that I was born without a sense of emotional/compassionate empathy, guilt or regret. I am not, however, a sociopath. At least my current (as well as my previous) psychiatrist doesn't believe so. It has been confirmed by many doctors, since I was around 3, and up until now, that I am incapable of feeling certain emotions. It feels like I am empty inside and while it's nothing I worry about, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes when I react to things much differently than others. 

I have experimented with many drugs but the only hallucinogen has been psilocybin and that was at an extremely low dose. I would like to see if an extremely introspective trip could offer some answers that I am looking for. I know some drugs can have disagreeable consequences in people who have histories of mental illness. As far as I know, I'm clear however, I was adopted and so I can't be 100% sure.

5-HTP is a very powerful tool to resolve serotonin depletion that occurs as a result of MDMA's flood like serotonin effects to your brain. However, it can be very dangerous for your heart valve muscle ^[1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15781732) 
^[2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12466135) Unless you use appropriate amounts of l-lysine which acts as a serotonin antagonist in the gut/heart valve ^[3](http://www.pnas.org/content/100/26/15370.short) and is too competitive with l-arginine too cross the blood brain barrier and interfere with 5-HTP's subjective recovery effects on serotonin depletion. I would also recommend supplementing straight tryptophan, a multivitamin and a B vitamin complex around your roll if possible with OMEGA-3's(in krill oil if you dont like the breathy effects).

As for antioxidants while your rolling, I like a variety of natural antioxidants mixed with Vitamin C, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Melatonin and small amounts of 5-HTP and GABA. I prefer to take them 1 hour before I drop, when I drop and then every two hours till I goto sleep.

My question arises from the fact that Straterra is purported to have notable efficacy as an ADHD medication despite no effects on DAT. Also Methylphenidate was chosen as an ADHD medication over its Analogue Ethylphenidate despite EPH having much higher selectivity for DAT.

I'm skinny as hell naturally- 128 and 6'1- but since I got put on a regiment for bipolar and ADHD about a year ago, I've had problems maintaining a state above starving without dropping any medications. We tried a lot before settling on this- it's the only one that works (mirtazapine, lithium and dextroamphetamine) both at work and in school. Without them, suicidal tendencies emerge and/or I rapid cycle myself into a hospital. Dropping them is not an option at this point.

I'm looking for appetite stimulators- and it's surprisingly hard. Weed and antihistamines are both out- weed induces psychosis for me (even at low doses) and mirtazapine is such a potent antihistamine, I've got a strong tolerance to benedryl and the like.

The doctors are out of ideas.

**tl;dr**: So do you guys know any substances or supplements- psychoactive, gray market or whatever, I don't care- that increase appetite noticeably? I'm desperate here. I've got stretch marks from where my skin has gotten too taut.

This survey is carried out by the governmental organization SAMHSA, and has collected data from approximately half a million participants over time.

After reading [this article](http://suburra.com/blog/2011/10/11/low-addiction-rates/), I became very interested in comparing the addiction rates of drugs, but was unsure how measure addiction.

I've made a couple graphs already, that might be somewhat illuminating.

* [A comparison of the rate of continued monthly  use.](http://imgur.com/PbCDmtx)
* [Average number of days/month current users use their respective drug.](http://imgur.com/1ngYbR5)
* [Median number of days/month current users use their respective drug.](http://imgur.com/uG7BNTl)
* [Comparative frequencies of using any given number of days/month for current users.](http://imgur.com/TVf82uT)

The interesting thing about these graphs is that in none of them does heroin appear to be the most addictive, but cigarettes. Furthermore, cocaine appears to be relatively non-addictive. Lastly, the graphs for cannabis and heroin look surprisingly similar (especially in the last one).

DMSO is definitely used medically to allow some drugs to pass through human skin. Does anyone know how feasible it would be to administer recreational drugs using this process?

I doubt it would ever be convenient enough to be worthwhile. I'm really just curious.

Wikipedia says that it's a highly effective solvent. I assume many recreational drugs could be dissolved in it, but I'd be interested to know about any likely exceptions.

More importantly, Wikipedia isn't specific on whether any chemical that can be dissolved in DMSO will readily penetrate skin, or if that only works on some compounds.

Would DMSO be at all effective in actually delivering chemicals to the bloodstream? I know that DMSO isn't used in nicotine patches, nicotine just happens to easily penetrate skin, but the fact the nicotine patches work suggests  that transdermal administration must be at least somewhat feasible for the administration of psychoactive drugs. How do you think it would stack up against other routes of administration? Can we make an effective MDMA patch? A heroin patch? Could be fun right?

Disclaimer: This is not based on any research papers and is merely educated conjecture.

It is common knowledge that SSRI withdrawal induces an unpleasant ""zap"" effect, often described as a bolt of electricity. Here's a potential theory for it:

1. SSRI drug blocks the transporter proteins (which would normally bring in Cl- ions to lower the resting potential of the cell).

2. Homeostasis causes more transporter proteins to be produced to counteract the drugs effects.

3. The SSRI is discontinued. Nothing is blocking the excessive transporters now. This causes them to bring an excess of Cl- ions into some cells (or less into others). This causes an irregularity in the resting voltage of the cell.

4. Now when the action potential fires the voltage is potentially to high causing too large an electric discharge, potentially activating surrounding neurones.

Anecdotally, my girlfriend and I both felt as though we had slept badly after a successful night of vivid, colourful Calea dreams despite sleeping for about 12 hours. It wouldn't surprise me at all if Calea works partly by disrupting REM sleep cycles.

I have recently been experiencing interesting phenomena and was wondering if anyone here has had similar experiences or information as to what is happening to me. Around 3 months ago I took acid with some friends. I am an experienced and responsible user who had taken a similar dose at least 25+ times before. The trip progressed smoothly - I was enjoying myself with my friends who had also taken a similar dose from the same sheet of acid.

6 hours into the trip I could feel myself beginning to come down. Our group was sitting in a room watching a cartoon to relax having been on a walk, the setting was relaxed and I was feeling well. Suddenly I experienced a sensation that felt very bizarre, rather like an electric surge had pulsed through my body. This caused me to become quite alert, the sensation was powerful and it caused me to direct my attention entirely away from the cartoon as I noted my heart rate rise rapidly.

At this point I left the room to get some air, thinking it would be good to perhaps get outside away from the enclosed space just for a moment to clear my head. At this point the sensation shot through me again, more intensely this time – it seemed to course through my body rapidly in no particular direction until I lost all tactile sensation. I was now somewhat concerned for myself, my heart rate had continued to climb and it was now at a level that I had not experienced outside of a rowing race. All this time I was telling myself to remain calm, but this was easier said than done as I had lost all ability to experience kinetic sensations. I could not feel clothes on me or have a sense of the space that my body occupied. Touching anything with my fingers left a tingling sensation in my fingers, but it remained alien and concerning. When I ran my fingers through my hair it was like being given a painless electric shock – the sensation was so overwhelming that I had to cease immediately, yet no actual pain was felt.

My friend saw that I was distressed and attempted to calm me down, but this was of little effect. I did not feel worried that I was in danger, but could not figure out what was happening to me and what had triggered it. There was nothing upsetting that I could identify as a trigger, and I had been in many far more intense situations on acid before that I found no real difficulty in dealing with. After pacing around for awhile to see if the effects would subside I was given a beer to see if that would calm me down, I noted with interest that the beer found my lips with ease yet I could not feel the beer in my hand nor have any sensation of my arm moving the can around.

At this point my partner arrived home and asked if I would like a shower to see if that would be of any assistance, I enjoyed the shower but could not stand to touch my hair and the towel imparted the same discomforting sensation across my body when I tried to dry myself. At this point I had identified that fabrics such as my sheets, dressing gown and my towel would cause the unpleasant sensation more than other things. Dressing myself required me to look at my hands to direct them, as I could not gain a sense of where they were if I could not see them. I became stuck inside my jersey due to this and required assistance to get it over my head. The entire experience was baffling me, I was remaining as calm yet my heart rate was still through the roof.

I eventually fell asleep 2 hours later and awoke to find that I could feel things again, yet some of the numbness remained from the night before. I saw a doctor about the episode and they said they could do nothing, it was likely a one off experience and that I should avoid lsd if I wished to avoid it in future. I have not touched lsd since, it used to be my favourite drug but I have avoided it since the episode.

Everything seemed to be back to normal, then last smoked weed for the 1st time in 3 weeks. I had taken a break for university having been a regular smoker for 3 years, I had taken similar length breaks before this one. After the session I was in my room when the same loss of tactile sensation hit me again, my heart rate shot up despite me remaining perfectly calm. I went and told my friend and tried to explore what was happening to me, I was aware it would fade and tried to remember if anything in my situation paralleled the last one that may have triggered it. After about 4 hours my sense of touch returned, yet I still felt odd. I awake this morning and I feel very bizarre, every now and then I will grab something and be unable to feel it – which is quite concerning. Does anyone have any idea what this is? I have a doctor’s appointment booked but any input is appreciated!

TL;DR – Experiencing total loss of tactile sensation when high, thought it was related to acid but now I am experiencing it again after smoking. I can’t feel anything and it is annoying / concerning to deal with.

The current level of brainwave activity is presented on a screen and visual and auditory stimuli are used to encourage the user to mimic that brain activity.

So, I'm wondering if someone were to start with a brain scan of someone on, say, MDMA, or really any other sort of drug, if neurofeedback could be used to mimic the effects of intoxication.

I gave her some of my supply, and in the interests of harm reduction I gave her the same supplement regimen that I use and explained how to use them.

Friday was the big night, and feedback on Saturday was that it had been a wonderful experience. However, later on Saturday (~18 hours after taking the MDMA) her boyfriend phoned me saying she was hyperventilating and was quite anxious. I had no immediate answers so they went to the hospital shorty after where she was admitted and diagnosed with serotonin syndrome. The doctor said it was likely related to the combination of MDMA and the Wellbutrin she takes. She has been discharged now and is fine.

*Some more info on what she took*

The **MDMA** was from my personal supply, which I sourced of the Road. I bought a 10g batch of crystal MDMA (Molly) a year ago and I've used it several times. I did an acetone wash on some of it and didn't lose much weight so I'm assuming high purity. I have not personally reagent tested, but others have. She took a **single 150mg dose** of unwashed product.

The supplement regimen is the one I use based on conventional wisdom and loosely based on the [RollSafe.org guide](http://www.rollsafe.org). For completeness sake this is what I gave her.

**Preload**

* Magnesium glycinate 1000mg 6 hours before, and another 1000mg an hour before

* ALA, 250mg of the non-racemic kind, 1 hour before

* Grape seed extract (150mg) and selenium (25ug)  stack, 1 hour before

* Vitamin C as ascorbic acid, 1000mg, 1 hour before

* a Tums, 1 hour before 

**Postload**

* 20mg citalopram, at end of roll before bed

* in the morning, a 5-HTP (50mg) and L-tyrosine (250mg) stack with various B vitamins, St Johns Wort (250mg) and Theanine (50mg)

She also took her regular Wellbutrin (XR, 300mg) in the morning.

So, where did it go wrong? Could the supplementation have just been too efficient? Is Wellbutrin more dangerous than it is commonly thought to be, especially in combinations like this?

I was prescribed Seroquel 50mg due to ongoing insomnia.  I have neither biopolar disorder, or any other psychiatric illness. From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine):
&gt; The use of low doses of quetiapine for insomnia, while common, is not recommended as there is little evidence of benefit and concerns regarding adverse effects.[11][12]

One of the studies linked to [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22510671) pubmed article with this conclusion:
&gt; There are potential safety concerns when using low-dose quetiapine for treatment of insomnia. These concerns should be evaluated in further prospective studies. Based on limited data and potential safety concerns, use of low-dose quetiapine for insomnia is not recommended.

My question is, does low dose (25mg) of Seroquel on occasion for insomnia pose a risk to me as represented in the article? Mainly I'm wondering if someone could explain in layman's terms the method of action (dopamine reduction?).  From a damage mitigation factor I have a few options with the following risks when I have a once a week insomnia issues:

* sleepless night - loss job performance, headache, anxiety, depression.  
* benzos/sleeping pills - dampening of intellect, mild depression, rebound anxiety.
* seroquel - morning grogginess, possible dangerous side effects.
* other herbal remedies - low % effectiveness, although GABA seems to be effective sometimes.

Any explanations on the above would be great so I can quantify the risk of the use of Seroquel.

After reading up on some ""cannabinoid-blocking"" drugs (usually marketed for dieting), I started noticing that many of the reported effects are extremely similar to how I experience THC these days. That being said, I certainly *used* to get very typical, positive effects from marijuana, and previously enjoyed it on a very regular basis. But over the course of 2 or 3 years, it became increasingly unpleasant, to the point where it now produces such negative effects for me that I avoid it like the plauge, and even have to leave a room if people are smoking weed, because even a mild contact high is very unpleasant.

*A list of the notable, newly developed effects I feel when smoking/eat/vaping THC (as well as other ""THC-like"" substances) within the past year or so:*

* Unpleasant/""gross"" sensation on all of my skin. I constantly feel as though my skin is stretched too tight while covered in dirt and grease.

* Insomnia

* Intense anxiety/nervousness

* involuntary muscle spasms/shaking, even with small doses

* Depressing, sometimes suicidal thoughts

* Strong loss of apatite, especially towards starchy foods

* Ability to perceive what's going on in my GI tract. This one may sound rather far-fetched, but I swear I start to actually feel food as it moves down my esophagus and through the intestines. It's honestly super gross.



*Positive effects that have NOT changed:*

* Semi-hallucinogenic visual qualities

* Enhanced enjoyment of music

It should be noted still enjoy a vast myriad of other states of non-sobriety, and am still very comfortable in other psychedelic experiences. I have not developed aversions to any drug except THC. For a while, I kept taking breaks and trying it again, hoping it would be even slightly enjoyable, but it only got worse. Numerous people have told me that I'm just not in the right setting or something, or just need a different mindset, and while I used to give in to these assertions, hoping for a change, I now have to just flat out avoid having it in my system at all costs. So please, for the love of god, do NOT try to convince me to try it in some different way. I am NOT here for advice on how to enjoy weed again.

I have read conflicting reports of 4-FA either being very dangerous or said to be less neurotoxic than normal amphetamine.
 


An excerpt from a forum:

&gt;""  Okay, so 4-FA neurotoxicity is a hot topic nowadays and most of people know very little about it and spread disinformation. I'm not claiming to be a pharmacist, nor a doctor, but these studies back up my claims. Now read:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;First thing needed to know is, that effects of halogenated amphetamines are different in rat brains compared to human, so we can't apply every research on rats to humans. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17038507
&gt;
&gt;Second thing I want to address is 4-FA comparison to chlorinated amphetamine, such as 4-CA. 4-CA is not neurotoxic in humans! 4-CA has been used as an antidepressant in the seventies.
&gt;
&gt;Considerable clinical application of 4-CA has been made, and it has been found effective as an antidepressant when used chronically at levels of 75 mg/day (van Praag et al., 1971; van Praag and Korf, 1976). There are very few side effects noted and the drug is tolerated very well. However, indications of raphe-nucleus degeneration (Yunger et al., 1974) and related neurotoxicity (Harvey and McMaster, 1976) in experimental animals have discouraged further clinical study.
&gt;The same applies to 4-CMA
&gt;
&gt;The N-methyl homolog of 4-chlorophenylisopropylamine (80, para-chloromethamphetamine p-CMA, Ro 4-6861, S-33) was also found to be a potent and long-lasting depleter of brain serotonin (Fuller et al., 1965). It has been compared with methamphetamine in normal subjects (Verster and van Praag, 1970) and has been evaluated clinically in comparison with 4-CA (79) as an antidepressant (Deniker et al., 1971; van Praag et al., 1971; van Praag and Korf, 1976). Typical dosages were between 60 and 90 mg/day, administered chronically for several weeks. There appeared to be no physical or psychic dependence developed, no cardiovascular complications, and no sleep or appetite problems.
&gt;
&gt;Third thing is, para-halogenated amphetamines deplete serotonin, but in a reversible way in humans, compared to irreversible in rats.
&gt;This finding indicated that p-fluoroamphetamine might share with p-chloroamphetamine the action that is responsible for short-term 5-HT depletion but lack the property of p-chloroamphetamine required for long-term effects. A later study confirmed that p-fluoroamphetamine was less potent than p-chloroamphetamine in depleting brain 5-HT (Harvey et al., 1977; Fuller, 1978).
&gt;With 4-chloroamphetamine and 4-bromoamphetamine, the depletion of brain 5-hydroxyindoles lasted for at least a week. 4-Fluoroamphetamine, in contrast, lowered serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels only for short times (2–6 hr) after drug injection, and 5-hydroxyindole levels were essentially back to normal within 24 hr.
&gt;The failure of 4-fluoroamphetamine to produce a long-lasting depletion of brain serotonin like that produced by 4-chloroamphetamine or 4-bromoamphetamine may reflect the inability of the fluoro-compound to be metabolized in the same way as the other haloamphetamines.
&gt;You see? 4-FA doesn't deplete serotonin in rat brain in irreversible way.
&gt;
&gt;Speculation alert: Looking at the atom radius, there's a chance that 4-FA is less neurotoxic than regular amphetamine, since data shows that serotonine depletion goes in hand with atom radius in para (4) position. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15677348

&gt;
&gt;TL;DR

&gt;1. 4-CA is not neurotoxic in humans, it's been proven to be safe in doses 75-90mg/day for a year. Same applies to methylated version.

&gt;2. Serotonin levels get back to normal in 24 hours after 4-FA indigestion, compared to ONE WEEK after 4-CA indigestion (and bigger halogenated amphetamines)

&gt;3. Therefor 4-FA is nothing like other halogenated amphetamines.

&gt;4. 4-FA has lesser addictive potential than plain old amphetamine, due to longer half-life ""


I was wondering what r/DrugNerds thinks about 4-FA and if it is a safe drug to use recreationaly at moderate doses no more than once every two weeks.

First of all, would it be safe to consume DMT (dimethyltriptamine) while on MDMA? According to wikipedia, DMT's effects on the psyche are caused by binding to serotonin receptors (obviously) but also the "" dopamine D1, α1-adrenergic, α2-adrenergic, imidazoline-1, sigma-1 (σ1), and trace amine-associated receptors"". This concerns me because I am under the impression that increased dopamine levels in the synaptic gap can lead to dopamine entering the areas where serotonin are stored, where they are then broken down, which process neurotoxic amounts of hydrogen peroxide in the process. Would DMT then cause increased damage to the brain?

My other question concerns  alcohol use while on MDMA. I know the obvious dangers concerning dehydration on MDMA, but I was wondering if low level alcohol consumption could help prevent hyperthermia. It is my understanding that neurotoxic damage to the brain dramatically increases with increasing body temperature. Would 1-2 drinks of alcohol cause vasodilatation and thus help maintain the overall body temperature at safer levels? Is this safe?

edit: Looking for trip reports or scientific (note:more than guesswork) about the safety/harm of consuming various drugs in combination with MDMA- Specifically, DMT and alcohol, but also mushrooms/LSD. Also, more information about vasodialators would be useful, are there any OTC avaiable that would not cause any problems but reduce body temp?",,False,self,t5_2sk32,True,,,True,t3_r67om,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/r67om/safety_of_drugs_coadministered_with_mdma/,

I am a complete drug nerd at this point, and I want to continue my studies in a classroom environment.

The other things I want to learn are the science behind why our brains hallucinate. What specifically in LSD, DXM, DXO, DMT, etc. causes such complex hallucinations, feelings of disassociation, and other drug induced feelings and states of mind. I was thinking of going into psycho-pharmacology but I'm not sure if that would really focus on what I am interested in. 

Like I said, I'm still coming down from my DXM trip so I'm not sure how fluidly I have really outlined what I am trying to say, but if you are confused as to my goals please just ask for a more specific whatever...I'm pretty confused and my brain is working at a million miles an hour.

I'm reasoning that if a person with migraines or cluster headaches can be helped by the vasoconstrictive effect of LSD or psilocybin, then a person with normal dilation of the blood vessels could get a headache from too much constriction, or by the vasodilation that follows the end of the drug's effect.

So I read that approx. 30% of amphetamine is excreted unchanged in the urine, dependent on urine pH.

Do drug tests test for the amphetamine compound itself, as some is excreted unchanged, or do they test for metabolites of amphetamine, like THC? Thanks :)

If so, then on the day of a drug test, for instance, I would actually want a basic urine the day of, so that I would be excreting much less of the compound at that point in time. Again, confirmation of my theory would be great.

(The reading about percentage excreted, for reference)

Under normal conditions, about 30% of amphetamine is excreted unchanged in the urine but this excretion is highly variable and is dependent on urinary pH. When the urinary pH is acidic (pH 5.5 to 6.0), elimination is predominantly by urinary excretion with approximately 60% of a dose of amphetamine being excreted unchanged by the kidney within 48 hours. When the urinary pH is alkaline (pH 7.5 to 8.0), elimination is predominantly by deamination (less than 7% excreted unchanged in the urine); the half-life ranging from 16 to 31 hours (Ellenhorn, 1997).

1. MDMA enters the axon terminal via the 5-HT reuptake transporters, and then prompts vesicles to flood the synapse with serotonin.

2. MDMA causes the 5-HT reuptake transporters to work in reverse, simultaneously stopping reuptake and dumping serotonin into the synapse.

I apologise in advance, I know this may not be 100% appropriate for this subreddit, but please don't downvote me right away. I need you guys. The reason I come here asking for advice is that this is one of the few places I trust people 1) have a clue what they're actually talking about 2) don't have irrational biases about taking pills.

My wife tasked me with researching whether there were any diet pills / weight loss supplements that were worth taking. I've done a lot of personal research on recreational substances, but finding reliable info on substances to aid weight loss turns out to be unexpectedly hard.

I know some of you must have looked into this, so I come here asking for advice. I appreciate any info or pointers to relevant info. 

To give you more details. My wife has a good track record if keeping her weight once she reaches her target weight. She would therefore like to take a supplement short term to help her reach her target. It's more realistic that she will reduce food intake rather than increase exercise.
An ideal substances would:

1. Promote weight loss in combination with reduced calorie intake. (Either supported by experimental or strong anecdotal evidence)
2. Be safe when taken daily over a period of 2 weeks 
3. Have only mild side effects (be they positive or negative, mild stimulant effects are acceptable)
4. Be relatively well studied or have a history of popular use to minimise the possibility of unknown long term side effects.

Rest assured that I will thoroughly research any substance that you suggest.

I've been wondering about yohimbine. It seems to fit the bill above, since its been around for a while, seems relatively safe, and has some [experimental evidence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1955308) to back up effectiveness.

There is evidence that Kappa-opioid receptor antagonists may have an antidepressant effect as well. This makes sense since receptor agonism here, by dynorphin and synthetic agonists, attenuate the activity of their Mu cousins and produce (subjectively) dysphoric effects.

I'm curious as to what exactly happens in the body after you've eaten (the postprandial state) that mutes the effects of psychoactives so powerfully. I'm sure we've all experienced just how strong this effect is personally if we've gone drinking on an empty stomach. What is it about the fed state that makes us so resistant to intoxication, or what is it about the fasted state that makes us so susceptible?

I've thought about it being an absorption issue, where food in the belly prevents drug absorption, but the effect is noticed regardless of the route of administration. After a big meal smoked, injected, or buccally-absorbed drugs all show a reduction in strength. Drugs that are active at extremely low doses (e.g.: LSD), however, tend to still work at approximately full strength, for whatever reason, but they are *very* much potentiated if they are administered in the fasted state.

I was also thinking about parasympathetic activation after a meal working counter to the adrenergeric mechanisms of a lot of drugs - this counterbalancing theory would explain a reduction in the effect of stimulating drugs, but the effect is also noticed with *depressant* drugs, most obviously alcohol.

There could also be an effect of high blood glucose and insulin levels after a meal: high metabolism levels might still allow the brain to function at a normal level. I remember reading Huxley's theory that mescaline ""starves the brain"" of sugar, disabling the cerebral reducing valve and producing the psychedelic state. It would therefore make sense that fed-state blood sugar levels could mute the experience...

Here is the post: (http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/pit12/anyone_know_what_it_is/"") 

Specifically, since some were commenting on the neurotoxicity of the substance, I am interested in anything relating to that. I would love to hear all of your experiences with 4FA, and any short-term or long-term effects that you guys have had from it. The sources that people gave in the other post are pretty good, but I want to hear about first hand experience if anyone has it.

Personally, I abused this chemical beyond my intentions, and am not exaggerating when I say that I took truly massive amounts of it. I took 6-7 grams over a 4-5 day period at one point with barely any sleep, and had many other similar indulgences. As I stated in the other post, I am worried about any damage I may have done to myself, but I do not feel as though I have brain damage. Obviously there are many factors, who knows, maybe my supplier was dumping the newly banned RC's back then and was just labeling it as 4FA. However, I had done meph and methylone and I do not think that my supply was either of those. The supplier was also very legit, and came with extremely high reviews.

The point is, I am fairly certain that this chemical was in fact 4FA, I abused it to the point where many people would say I most definitely would have brain damage, and I do not feel as though I do.

Does the fact that I feel relatively fine after such abuse mean that it was definitely not 4FA, or is 4FA not as neurotoxic as some make it out to be??

Abstract

A petroleum ether extract (FP) from Fructus Psoraleae, seeds of Psoralea corylifolia L. (Leguminosae), was found to strongly inhibit dopamine (DA) uptake by dopamine transporter (DAT) heterogeneously expressed cells (D8 cells) and noradrenaline (NE) uptake by noradrenaline transporter (NET) heterogeneously expressed cells, which, however, had no effect on γ-aminobutyric acid transporter heterogeneously expressed cells and serotonin transporter heterogeneously expressed cells at the concentration up to 100 μg/ml. These inhibitory effects were also confirmed by experiments on SK-N-SH cell line and synaptosomes from rats’ brains. In addition, FP showed a significantly mitigating effect on 1-methyl-4-pyridinium induced injury of D8 cells. Meanwhile, FP dose-dependently reduced the binding of tritium-labeled cocaine analog (−)-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane to DAT of D8 cells, which suggests that FP may inhibit DAT activity in the same way as cocaine does. Behavioral study showed FP had a long-lasting stimulant effects on the activity of intact mice and reserpinized mice. So FP is proposed as a kind of DAT and NET inhibitor and may be involved in the process of regulating the DA and NE system, and FP or its unknown bioactive compounds may be developed into new medicines for disorders such as Parkinson's disease, depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or cocaine addiction.



Bakuchiol analogs inhibit monoamine transporters and regulate monoaminergic functions

Abstract

Monoamine transporters play key roles in controlling monoamine levels and modulating monoamine reuptake. The objective of the present study was to identify monoamine transporter inhibitors from herbal sources. We discovered that bakuchiol analogs isolated from Fructus Psoraleae inhibited monoamine transporter uptake to differing degrees. The bakuchiol analog, Δ3,2-hydroxybakuchiol was the most potent and efficacious reuptake blocker and was thus selected as the candidate target. Monoamine transporter inhibition by Δ3,2-hydroxybakuchiol was more selective for the dopamine transporter (DAT) (IC50 = 0.58 ± 0.1 μM) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) (IC50 = 0.69 ± 0.12 μM) than for the serotonin transporter (SERT) (IC50 = 312.02 ± 56.69 μM). Δ3,2-Hydroxybakuchiol exhibited greater potency (pEC50 for DAT and NET) than bupropion and exhibited similar efficacy (Emax for DAT and/or NET) to bupropion and GBR12,935. Pharmacokinetically, Δ3,2-hydroxybakuchiol competitively inhibited DAT and NET with partial reversibility and occupied cocaine binding sites. Moreover, Δ3,2-hydroxybakuchiol counteracted 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced toxicity in cells expressing DAT with similar efficacy to GBR12,935. In vivo studies showed that Δ3,2-hydroxybakuchiol increased the activity of intact mice and improved the decreased activity of reserpinized mice. In the conditioned place preference test, preference scores in intact mice were unaffected by Δ3,2-hydroxybakuchiol treatment.

* **Does it interact with other drugs?** especially, MDMA, LSD, and 2C-X? I've read it has some cross-tolerance with MDMA but I'd like to know more.

Specifically, I'm going to a two-day festival soon and I want to do the 6-apb the first day and candyflip the second day and I'm wondering if it's even worth it to take the MDMA or if I should up my dose or do LSD and 2C-E instead or what.

There shouldn't be any cross-tolerance with the acid, right?

* **What's the safety of this like long- and medium-term?** It's supposed to be less neurotoxic than MDMA, but as it's probably a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, I'm going to use the same precautions as Molly, including:

-only taking it once a month max

-post-loading with 5-htp

-pre- and post- loading anti-oxidants

-tons of water

For those unfamiliar with the process you basically crush up your pills and stir it into hot water for a bit, then pour through a coffee filter (two if you want more filtration) and you're left with undissolved material on the coffee filter, and a slightly milky substance in the water (which you may then boil or evaporate off).

No one so far has been able to say if the binders are in the cup or on the filters. but this should be pretty easy to determine by taste, right? One will have that distinct adderall sweetness and one will have the acrid bitterness of your typical amphetamine. Is this correct? Is it the binders that make the adderall ""sweet?""

**TL;DR** Once you've separated the binder from the amphetamine in adderall you should easily be able to tell which is which based on how they taste. Tell me if I'm wrong.

The study is not without flaws, and has been criticized [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2012-08-28-does-smoking-dope-turn-you-into-one/) and [here](http://healthland.time.com/2013/01/15/new-research-questions-marijuanas-impact-in-lowering-iq/).

Further, an [earlier, smaller study](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/166/7/887.full) suggests the opposite: adolescent marijuana use increases IQ for light users, and leaves the IQ of former heavy users basically untouched.

The most concerning aspect of the Dunedin Study, in my opinion, is that it appears to suggest that using marijuana before the age of 18 essentially primes us to be further harmed by adult use. For example, if I was a smoker in adolescence and my buddy wasn't, and we are both smoking a joint at age 30, then that joint is causing me more damage than it is causing him.

There's a *very* brief Wikipedia article, which gives a little bit of info, and a pretty-much-useless thread on Bluelight. It seems that about the only scholarly info on this compound is in [this paper in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jm9705925), which is paywalled (though I was able to access it through my university library proxy).

Here's a summary of the info I was able to glean from my searching:

**Layman's info:**  
5MeMDA is an MDA derivative (duh) whose effects are supposed to include euphoria, empathogenic/entactogenic effects, and psychedelic effects; it is notably *lacking* in stimulant effects. It is also significantly more potent than MDA, with an active dose believed to be in the range of 15-25 mg (threshold dose likely around 5-10 mg).

**More science-y stuff: (skip this if you don't care about how drugs work)**  
I say that the effects are *supposed to* include the above because I can't actually find a detailed, confirmed report of a human using it. The above information is based on rat bioassays:

*In vitro*, 5MeMDA was found to be a more potent serotonin releasing agent than MDA by a factor of about 4-5 while exhibiting negligible effects on dopamine and norepinephrine. A study cited by the one linked above suggests that this might reduce its toxicity compared to MDA.

*In vivo*, trained rats could tell 5MeMDA apart from amphetamine (easily) and LSD (not as easily), but did not differentiate it from sufficient doses of MBDB, MMAI (both entactogen/empathogens), and DOI. These results suggest that 5Me-MDA exhibits entactogen/empathogen effects as well as psychedelic effects (though the rats appear to be able to differentiate tryptamine and phenethylamine psychedelics).

**THE POINT:**  
I want to know if anyone here has used 5MeMDA, and what the qualitative effects were. Please keep in mind that the dosage is significantly less than most other ""ecstasy"" drugs, so if you took about 100 mg and had a relatively normal roll, chances are what you took was *not* 5MeMDA.",,False,self,t5_2sk32,False,,,True,t3_1b3i15,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/1b3i15/5methylmda_infodump_and_request_for_experience/,

So assuming the first graph is correct, in that when you take a drug, you will feel the effects or ‘high’, and then after a certain amount of time, you will begin to crash, and then go back to normal. 

Now, what happens when you take another dose of the same drug halfway through the effects of the first dose? Would you become more ‘high’ again, and then later crash much harder, but completely stave off the crash from the initial dose? (see example A)

Or would you feel the crash from the first dose, and also be high at the same time, and then later, coming down from both doses, crash even  harder? (see example B)

I was on different SSRIs during each incident. I had an enzyme test and I am a poor metabolizer of CYP2D6 and extensive metabolizer of CYP2C19. I know a lot of painkillers won't work because I can't metabolize codeine into morphine. I was wondering what effect this would have on other drugs. My dr. told me I shouldn't take LSD because I'd risk seratonin sydrome again but this doesn't make much sense to me if it was the SSRI I wasn't metabolizing not the serotonin itself.

Any information would be great, about ""legal"" drugs (painkillers, anasthesia etc.) or other drugs. Thank you.

[Update #3],12,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/1456v8/alcohol_extraction_of_psiolocybin_from_pf_cakes/,"So I re tried the experiment with dried cakes I had leftover from attempt #1. I used 95% Ethanol this time and also let the cake powder extract longer. I reduced from 400ml Ethanol to about 50mL and saw some promise when I found the infamous white residue on the bottom. I split the 50mL between 4 of us tonight and absolutely nothing happened... Again. So here is my conclusion. Either cakes that have not bore fruit, i.e. young cakes do not have any psilocybin/psilocin content or I am not consuming a proper dose. My next experiment will be with 95% Ethanol and spent cakes. Spent cakes tend to bruise blue more often than young cakes, in my experience, thus indicating to me a psil content of some noticeable level. If that does not work I will abandon alcohol as an effective extracting method and try acidic water as the psils are more soluble in water than in alcohol. Or I may abandon this experiment all together. Why spend 20-30 bucks on alcohol to extract a compound I just grew for free? Other than regulating doses, I see little value to continue. But I might...

Never took medications and almost no drug use aside from alcohol.  At age 24, depression had become too severe and sought psychiatric help.  Citalopram, depakote, abilify; none of these helped.  Tried Adderall illegally, and it was wonderful.

Eventually got a Rx for Ritalin and Bupropion.  Life was pretty awesome aside from peripheral side effects like vasoconstriction (cold hands, weak erection).  Doctor pulled me off these drugs after 18 months because she's retarded (long story), sent my life into a downward spiral.

Tried selegiline, helped a little bit but still exhausted chronically.

Got on d-amphetamine and bupropion about 6 months ago, and I've been up and down.  Asked to get off the bupropion because of bad erection issues.  But my mood was totally dependent on the amphetamine, so **I am currently back on 10mg d-amphetamine and 150mg bupropion.**  I also started smoking cigarettes during the period when I was un-medicated, a habit I still have.

Here's my problem:
d-Amphetamine/bupropion can be awesome, but sometimes makes me uncomfortably anxious and jittery, and I get weak erections.  It is also hard to maintain a stable happy state- I tend to be up and down.  Sometimes I get shakey hands when I DONT take d-AMP, and sometimes I get it when I do.  Without it, my blood pressure can get low and leave me weak-legged as well.

*What do you think about replacing or augmenting the regimen with pramipexole?*  I would like a more consistent mood, and also long-term amphetamine use scares me.  My father was diagnosed with Parkinson's at age 60, and we are very alike (he was a life-long depressive but never took medication for it).  I also have the blood pressure and vasoconstriction issues that I would like to not deal with.

Also, I realize people will point out the the cigarettes could be contributing to the ED or blood pressure issues, but I have experienced these issues prior to starting... though smoking can make me severely light-headed at times, especially when NOT on stimulants.

Now I have never encountered a problem taking too much of those, however, I have taken some serotonin related stimulants and I have noticed something that happens when too much is taken: You become so fast that you slow down and in extreme cases, you get serotonin syndrome. Coincidently, Parkinson's Disease is similar: you get very jittery, and in extreme cases, you can barely move, sometimes not at all.

[The causation of Parkinson's is unknown.](http://www.webmd.com/parkinsons-disease/parkinsons-causes) That being said, I have a hypothesis. Perhaps the causation of Parkinson's is an influx of too much dopamine, maybe over a period of time or all at once. 

I also had another idea. If I am right about the causation of Parkinson's, perhaps there is a cure for serotonin syndrom. Now I have not done very much research --seeing as how the idea just came to me-- but perhaps a drug like L-SERO could be used to treat people with serotonin syndrome.

is a single use of an MAOI likely to interact dangerously with my asthma medication? and if so, do you have a recommendation for how long i would need to abstain from the medication before ingesting the MAOI?

This is a tad more personal than the standard /r/drugnerds post, but I'll try to keep it brief. Amphetamine dependence is not as easy to treat as some other chemical dependencies, such as alcohol or opioid dependence-- substitution therapy in particular is much less successful. I don't mean to trivialize those addictions- but to fight a heavy reliance on amphetamines, little more can be done than to ride out the heavy withdrawal. One substance has recently been singled out in investigation of stimulant tolerance and dopamine sensitization-- baclofen! 

Here's the key study on the matter, [for your perusal](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16170232). Some other ones to consider: [this one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1183554/) and [this one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11271399).

So as it works out, I've got a solid baclofen prescription alongside my vyvanse prescription, for use in treating lithium-induced downbeat nystagmus. I'm approved using up to 30mg a day, every day, by my doctor. I've tried a number of times to quit using amphetamines, despite my ADHD, but every time I end up coming back. So I'm going to try my little experiment, and put the theories established in these articles to the test. If this works, it may offer some hope to others in a similar position, maybe as an alternative to the controversial DXM method.

I plan on taking my max dose every morning with my vyvanse. So 30mg baclofen and 20mg vyvanse in the morning, plus my usual 15mg of mirtazipine and 450mg of lithium in the evening. I will try this for two weeks, and report back on the one-week and two-week mark to provide my results. I wish there were a decent way of controlling for placebo, but we'll see.

I haven't found any information on why/how this happens.

Basically, what I'm talking about are small ""shocks"". It lasts just a moment, I can feel when it's about to happen, the feeling increases exponentially for about a second or shorter until it hits the ""climax"", it feels like the brain is overloading, or being shocked with electricity. It doesn't really hurt though, but it can get annoying because it happens so frequently and is extremely abruptive.

It usually follows intense thoughts, like ""epiphanies"" and the likes, if you've tried psychedelics you know what I'm talking about. Sometimes it doesn't happen for 15 minutes, sometimes I get multiple zaps in a row with just a few seconds in between.

I've googled this, and ""brain zaps"" were the closest thing to a term I could find. It seems to be a common sympton of SSRI withdrawals, which leads me to think it has something to do with serotonin.
I have only heard of a few people experiencing this on psychedelics, and none/almost none as frequently as me (I easily get like 20-30 zaps per trip). It seems everyone experiences it slightly different as well. Have any of you guys experienced this?

Oh yes, and did I mention I also get this during hypnagogia (transition from wake to sleep) 
if I attempt lucid dreaming or conscious sleep paralysis? What does this imply? What is the connection between sleep and drugs? Serotonin again?

Second try today.  I took my meds at 7am on the 6th.  did not re-dose on the meds on the 7th. at 9:20pm i dosed 50mg of MDMA. about an hour later i feel the same as the first time.  but it keeps going.  i peak at 11pm.  i'm not rolling hard, mind you, but i am feeling it and it feels like it did before i was on meds.  took an awesome shower, and walked barefoot through the wet grass. it felt awesome!

""Additionally, the reduction process (e.g., hydrogenation) results in the reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond in the side chain of the flavokawains (or in other kava kava components) to give saturated flavokawain derivatives (or other derivatives of kava kava components that are less toxic or more easily isolated) that account, in part, for the change in color and less irritating effects. Furthermore, the exposure of flavokawains or other kava kava components to aqueous base treatment (e.g., LiOH, NaOH) also results in conversion of the flavokawains or other kava kava components to water soluble derivatives that are either less colorful (and also less irritating) or are easier to separate (e.g., remove, extract, chromatograph, isolate) from other kavalactones than flavokawains with the unsaturated side chain or kava kava components in their original form. In one aspect, the invention is a 7,8-dihydrokawain and 7,8-dihydromethysticin enriched hydrogenated extract (e.g., kavalactone extract) from rhizome of Piper methysticum Forst, wherein said extract comprises 7,8- Dihydrokawain and 7,8-Dihydromethysticin in at least 50% (e.g., at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, atwe least any integer % between 50% and 99% ) of the total content of kavalactones by weight""

1367277193.0,9,self.DrugNerds,1ddeix,I'm gonna be doing a pretty aggressive taper off of phenibut next week and will try using tianeptine to minimize withdrawal symptoms. Anyone tried this before?,13,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/1ddeix/im_gonna_be_doing_a_pretty_aggressive_taper_off/,"First, I'll give some rationale for using tianeptine, then share my taper plan. If you've experimented with tapering off of phenibut or using another substance (other than baclofen) to help with the withdrawal I'd like to hear your thoughts and experiences. I think most people here are aware of the withdrawal symptoms from long-term phenibut use and I've gone through them myself so need to harp on that point. 

There is some evidence that tianeptine reduces agitation, tremors etc. during acute alcohol withdrawal in rats (link below). Since most of these alcohol symptoms are associated with reduced density of GABA-b receptors in the brain and since phenibut primarily agonizes GABA-b receptors I am thinking that tianeptine could help. If it does, it would be particularly useful since tianeptine acts on the serotinergic system and, thus, is not simply a substitute GABA agonist like baclofen. This would cause the GABA system to restore equilibrium faster I believe.

I've been using phenibut 5-6 days a week (1-4 grams per day) for about 2 months and will be doing an aggressive taper next week. My taper plan is to plan out a schedule of ""cheat days"" where I'll take 2 grams throughout the day and then off days where I wont take any. The schedule would look like this: Cheat--off--cheat--off--off--cheat--off--off--off--cheat--etc. until I'm down to one cheat day a week. Basically just continuing to add one day off after every cheat day. The tianeptine I would take on the off days, thus reducing the tolerance for it to build up by taking it consecutively. 

As a side comment; I highly recommend tapering to anyone who's been using phenibut ""too much"" rather than just going cold turkey. No doctor would advise you to quit benzos or other GABA agonists cold turkey so why some people choose to do that is beyond me. I think most people who feel the withdrawal freak out that they're killing themselves with phenibut so they just want to be done with it. Don't freak out! The last time I came off of phenibut I used the same tapering schedule but only added off days after every other cheat day and it was really not that bad. I'm sure if you extended this to adding off days after every third day it would be very doable.

It also cuts down on the neurotoxicity potential of the drugs for quite a long time, measured up to six months (IIRC) after the dosing ceases.

Does this mean that if one were to take, say, 15 mg of meth once or twice a week for five weeks, the effects would increase despite the dosage staying the same?

This is all completely anecdotal evidence, so please don’t think this is in any way a properly scientific report. These are my thoughts I have had on drugs and how they affect me, so remember that.

I want to start this with the time dilating effects of cannabis upon myself, which make time appear to be going more slowly. This is a problem to productive individuals, such as myself, because when I am doing things, such as writing a report, reading a book or taking a walk, I get very impatient and anxious, especially when I am by myself and it is something that I have done before.

The cause (occasionally) for this anxiety is my perception of time going slower, which makes me feel as if I am taking a longer time to do things. In reality, this is not the case, instead I am doing things at the same pace as normal, it is just my sense of time which affects my motivation. The slower (and higher) I am, the more I feel smothered by my inability to do things, which is really just my sense of time fucking me up.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, there are amphetamines. When I take them, I do things faster. I can concentrate better. But I also lose track of time and I think it is not as late as it really is. So, for me, amphetamines actually speed up time. What this means is that while you may actually be doing the same amount of work, it seems just like a shorter amount of time.

My thoughts on this are so: these drugs affect our sense of time (and obviously, also our actual ability to focus, weed makes me feel as if I have ridiculous ADD) in both negative and positive fashions. It is ( in addition to the actual effects of the drugs, such as amphetamines causing a release of dopamine, which is now said to be linked to ‘motivation’) in our ability to perceive time that we feel either productive or unproductive.

So, I'm a pharmacy student and I work as a demonstrator for pharmaceutics practicals which are basically practicals on how to mix various types of formulations for drug delivery. Like solutions, suspensions, gels, creams, ointments, suppositories, the works. So anyway, in the lab where I work we have our component jars spread along the walls and one that caught my interest a while ago was a bottle labeled ""Fluorescein Sodium."" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein) So anyway, this fascinated me and I looked in a textbook to read all about it. Then, with my supervisor's permission I mixed some in water to see what it would do. It was a small sample, just a spatula tip. So, it turns out this stuff has, as its name suggests, a fluorescent effect when in solution. So, I deemed this to be fairly cool as it looks green without light and red with normal room lighting, and it glows fluorescent green under black light. I took some home and deposited it in an empty vodka bottle. I then filled that with water and now currently have a really fucking cool looking bottle.
Now, what I want to know from any chemistry ents or anyone who can find out for me...would it be safe to put water containing fluorescein or its sodium salt in a bong and then smoke through it?

Wanted to lay a sheet of blotter to give my friends a couple ten strips and to supply a get together I'm having soon. My cool little blotter paper didn't come with any absorbency information and I was wondering if there were any simple experiments I could run to determine the total absorbency of one sheet (100 hits). The way I was going to go about it was take a 5x5 section, submerse it in a solution, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, remove it, and measure the leftover solution to determine the total amount of solution the 5x5 section holds. Then, divide by 25 to determine absorbency of a single blotter and multiply it by 100 for the whole sheet. I may be over thinking it, but part of me feels like I need to adjust for molarity after adding the solvent, which throws my whole calculation out of wack because I don't necessarily know how to do this and really don't want to waste time determining the amount of mg a blotter (drying/evaporating it i guess) can hold total as I don't plan to impregnate the blotter to its max potential with the substance. I'm sure 1mg is not an unreasonable amount to place on a blotter. I plan on spreading 100mg over the sheet to produce 1mg per blotter. Is there any widely known absorbency of blotter paper that would help me out. The blotter came in a 7.5""x7.5"" sheet of 900 hits.

:EDIT#1: I DO NOT plan on redistributing this blotter under any other name or selling it as LSD. I come from a respected community in my area that really REALLY frowns upon this. These are my friends, and frankly they would be well aware that the substance was DOx the minute they started tripping. I would look like a fool, and an asshole.

I have a mild, generalized anxiety disorder as well as a severe case of Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (a sleep disorder that causes involuntary muscle spasms during the night, preventing me from having restful sleep).

Apparently things like this are caused by low levels of dopamine in the brain.

The meds I take for my anxiety disorder help with the anxiety, but ended up being the cause of my sleep disorder. I choose to go off the anxiety meds and deal with my anxiety without drugs because the drugs for the sleep disorder have severe side effects that I could not deal with. Now my sleep disorder has dissapeared.

Anyway, I was just curious about how dopamine and dopameric agents work in my brain regarding my specific case as well as in general. And, what are things that I can do in my to increase the dopamine levels in my brain?  Are there natural ways to increase dopamine levels? 



Edit: also, I feel that I have done a good job of using non-medical means of controlling my anxiety/depression - I feel almost back to normal (the way I felt before the anxiety/depression happened to me. The only thing that bothers me sill is that I suffer from general lack of motivation. That's the only lingering thing.

Like your brain measures the amount of REM you have recieved and determines ""Yep, I've slept enough. Time to wake up."" Since you've been used to less REM for a long period, that amount of REM is now considered ""normal."" 

Thus, when you quit smoking and your REM levels adjust back to normal, your brain still expects the same, lower amounts of REM so it wakes you up when it reaches those levels because it believes you have recieved a full night's sleep. 

Obviously, the sedative effects of marijuana also factor into lower sleep quality, and these observations are based on personal anectadotal evidence. I'm not sure if any of this is sound science.

A question and warning.,14,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/179mz8/vilazodone_mdma_serotonin_syndrome_a_question_and/,"A friend of mine with diagnosed depression is on 40mg Vilazodone (Viibryd) and 300mg Quetiapine (Seroquel). She purchased some MDMA which did not test for any adulterants. When she told me that she was on medication, I did some searching but wasn't able to find any reports of interactions with MDMA, but I advised her not to take it until we were able to determine that there wouldn't be issues. Well, one night on a sort of whim, she did, and she got incredibly sick from it. From what she described, it sounded like serotonin syndrome: she was shaking, sweating, had a fever, and was confused and scared. She thought she was going to die. Thankfully, she did not.

I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else would run into this issue, and also I was wondering if some of the more knowledgeable of you could offer a hypothesis as to what occurred. My understanding is that SSRIs will dampen the roll or prevent it altogether, but I didn't realize that it could trigger serotonin syndrome.

edit:

&gt;I had been on the Vybriid and Seroquel for a few months. I'm pretty sure I took 6 *[small capsules, I'd estimate ~350mg MDMA]*. I took some Valium as directed by a physician roughly 4 hours after taking it to reduce the muscle spasms and jaw clenching/teeth grinding. You might also want to mention that 9 days or so later I attempted suicide. I don't think it was directly related to having taken the mdma, I was already being treated to depression prior, but the Tuesday blues or whatever it's called, were pretty horrific and I didn't feel like it was lessening.

&gt;I can't see myself ever ever trying it again, and not just because of the medication I'm on, but because I struggle with depression anyways and have had prior suicide attempts and it seems like too risky a chance to ever take again

I hadn't previously realized that she took so much, I thought it was from a normal dose. Thanks for all of the information, everyone.

This wandering hotness came and went over the next about 10 hours.

I also had wandering itchiness.  This was an intense, deep, itchiness that was impossible to ignore.  The next day my leg was covered in bloody scabs from my scratching fingernails.  (No deliberate self harm, just a lot of scratching).  I had some scratching on my forearms too, but nothing nearly as bad as my one leg.

Normally I'm not good with itchy scratchy stuff.  (I have an anaesthetic cream because if hate itchiness so much.) I didn't seem to care about this, even though it was much much itchier than anything else I've ever had.

I was put on Wellbutrin 2 weeks ago at 150mg, and was instructed to ramp up to 300mg last week.

My hallucinations were consistent with other reports.

My question is: how will bupropion affect a potential LSD experience, pharmacologically speaking? I know bupropion's main action is on norepinephrine reuptake inhibition (which shouldn't affect an LSD trip, I wouldn't think), but from what I understand it also acts on dopamine, which would definitely fall in line with what I experienced. Will I have a cross-tolerance with psychedelics? Can I expect my experience to be significantly different than before I went on the medication?

I thought I would share my day yesterday because we did done fancy things. We had laid several sheets of 25I--NBOMe in the freebase form complexed with hpbcd. We laid a gram total with tabs of one mg. For whatever reason though the tabs didn't work. We reasoned that we were sold the wrong sugar to complex and realized we needed to go another path.

So what we did is wash to tabs with plenty of vinegar several times. This dissolved all the sugar and 25I while at the same time converting it to an acetate salt. Next we added an excess of baking soda and allowed the reaction to fully complete. This freebases the 25I which in turn precipitates it. 

However we still had baking soda precipitated as well. So we filtered the vinegar and then washed all the powder in the filter with water, dissolving any residual baking soda and sugar and leaving only 25I. From here we redissolved the powder in vinegar converting the freebase back to an acetate salt.

This is where we are now. The next step is to boil then freeze precipitate the stuff and allow all the vinegar to evaporate, recrystallizing the nbome. Once this is all dry we'll weigh the resulting crystals to figure out how many tabs to lay it on then redissolve in an appropriate amount of vinegar and lay back on the tabs. Still not sure how much we recovered but its a substantial amount of powder and I don't think we lost too much.

Pharma-types are looking for new ways to deliver pharmaceuticals to specific areas- put the toxins directly into tumors or send things directly to the brain without needing to injest or inject, which floods the entire bloodstream (and may be quite inefficient).


One idea is to use [drug-loaded gold nanoparticles](http://ars.sciencedirect.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0168365910004098-fx1.jpg). These little chunks of gold are loaded with an, ehhem, drug of interest, which can be released by illuminating it with specific wavelengths of light.

Your psychedelics could directly take effect. You could give yourself stroboscopic waves of psychedelics. You could set it interactively to music or visual media.


As a low dose acting directly onto the brain, I imagine the effect might fade faster than the traditional routes; it can always be combined with traditional ingestion, and activated for strategic peaks.

I'm curious if you can give me some insight! Here it goes.

My gf and I want to have a baby. But we also want to take mushrooms. We are responsible citizens so we are trying to find out the risks. Of course we will not take any mushrooms (and/or other drugs/alcohol) when we find out she is pregnant or even near ovulation. We thought about it and thought that right at the start of the menstruation cycle (1st day) would be a day of the least risk using mushrooms, when the new cycles of follicles are grown. Googling did not yield any results. So the basic question is this:

Does anyone know whether you risk damaging follicles or growth of the follicles if you take mushrooms on the first day of the cycle? The psilocin/psilocybin should have left the body in 2 to 3 days anyway.

Assume that the rest of the time we won't do any shrooms whatsoever.

Thank you so much in advance for your ideas/analysis...

PS Yes we know that it's best to avoid taking mushrooms alltogether. It's just that we are interested in knowing if you can reduce any risks, or whether there are any risks at all at that stage.

However, smoking is unhealthy, so, if I want to continue smoking (which I do), it would be in my best interest to pursue some avenue of harm reduction.

There are plenty of seemingly viable options for that; patches, lozenges, and electronic vaporizers are all possibilities.

Here's the problem. Studies on rats indicate that without the co-administration of an MAOI, **nicotine is not significantly addictive**. Give rats nicotine alone and they don't care, they don't come back for more. Give rats nicotine along with an MAOI and they love it as much as humans do.

There are a multitude of psychoactive chemicals present in tobacco smoke. The specific pleasurable feeling that smoking tobacco produces is a synergistic effects of those chemicals. At the very least, some MAOI that naturally occurs in tobacco (or that is produced in the burning process) is vital to that pleasurable feeling.

As I understand it, most electronic cigarettes only deliver nicotine. Which would explain why all of the cigarette smokers I know who have tried them say they just don't like them as much and go back to real cigarettes. Without the MAOIs found in tobacco smoke, electronic cigarettes just don't scratch that itch. Is it the same with patches and lozenges? 

Do any of the companies that produce these products try and carefully reproduce the active constituents of tobacco smoke? I assume that these products are produced using pure refined nicotine powder so that the exact concentrations can be easily controlled. If any of them were produced using unpurified goo roughly extracted from actual tobacco, those products might do a better job recreating the actual cigarette feeling.

Snus packets might be a viable option. I would guess that they are made using actual tobacco and not just nicotine, but they can also give you mouth cancer, right?

If anyone has seen a detailed breakdown of the chemical constituents of tobacco smoke or the chemical constituents of smoking alternatives, that would be really cool and I'd love a link.

During that time, I also went to a psychologist once a week and by the time that year and a half was over, I noticed a night and day difference with how much my condition improved. I could say I was virtually cured of my OCD with only the occasional stupid obsessions that I could easily ignore. However, during this time I have also been drinking and smoking weed here and there and especially now that it's summer I've been doing it a lot more frequently. (Since I entered college I have increased my drug usage also). However, I really regret this decision as I've noticed that my condition has worsened; not anywhere near as bad as it was before, but definitely worse than when I first started taking my medication. I can't say that this was ALL caused by the other drugs because I was under lots of stress in college, not seeing a therapist anymore, etc. so there were probably other factors involved. But I want to definitely abstain from the drug usage completely since I know that could be a cause. Are there any ways to make the medication start working as it did in the beginning? I really wouldn't want to have to up my dosage as it would probably cost more and I don't want to put my parents in any more financial debt. I just want to know if changing my habits could help me get back on track?

Recently I decided I wanted to try 4-fa as a psuedo-adderall, after hearing reviews it acted similarly after the empathogenic effect wore off. Its binding profile appears similar to adderall, so that furthered my interest. This all came after I experienced an immense increase in my focusing abilities during class, and while reading my organic chem book. Today I recieved my 4-fa, and did a mass spec, and a h-nmr on it verifying that it was in fact 4-fa. I dosed 150mg of it, and felt near nothing. This brings up all sorts of questions in my mind as to why this occurred, since with 50mg of ephedrine I noticed quite a change. So i guess my question is, does anybody know why this would occur? Does wellbutrin have a strong affinity for receptors than 4-fa, but not ephedrine?

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Update: Two days without wellbutrin, I dosed at 110mg, It was successful. A definite increase in attention, and very mild euphoria. Very promising as a study aid, however, I will be discontinuing my trials. If I want a study aid, I am going to go with a legal prescription. The fact that all amphetamines a neurotoxic, makes me want to avoid taking 100+mg dosages of this, versus the 5-10mg dosage of adderall. assuming similar nuerotoxicity, i would much prefer approximately 1/10th of the molecule to be processed by my body.",,False,self,t5_2sk32,True,,,True,t3_qfd4a,http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/qfd4a/question_about_wellbutrin_interactions_ephedrine/,

Since your pupils are allowing too much light, your eyes become overstimulated in the same manner as if you were just staring into a light. Damage may not only be caused by size of pupils alone, but also duration of trip and enlarged pupils in general( maybe HPPD is more linked to LSD than shrooms, because of trip time)
