In 2007 my dad and I trained for a year together and did our first Ironman (Lake Placid). I was 18. He was 44. 

Having worked long hours for most of his life, this father/son bonding time proved to be some of the most important times of my life. His goal was to eventually make it to Kona. He hadn't exercised in years and weighed 250+ pounds, but had seen the NBC coverage and realized if they could make it, he could too. He gave up eating Arby's all the time, and let go of his attachment to the gut he had that our family referred to as ""the baby."" After years of training, eating healthy, recovering intelligently, and pushing his limits; dad finally got a ticket this weekend. 

I couldn't be more proud. If you're training, don't stop believing even after injuries, setbacks, fears, and frustrating moments... PUSH ON. Sorry for the mini rant, but my 50 year old dad has never bragged, boasted, showboated, flaunted, or even wanted to really talk about this pursuit. I can't keep it in.

Hey folks,

Would you like to rep /r/triathlon? Find other r/triathletes at races? I'm stepping up to get the ball rolling on a kit order for /r/triathlon, but I need YOUR help.

1) I need to know if there's interest! Please fill out the survey [HERE](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/N9ZQPFM), then upvote the crap out of this post.^#, ^##

2) I need some designers to step forward! The button's on the survey, but if you have a passion for this, I totally encourage you to get working on a design.

3) Give me some feedback! If there's something you think I missed, let me know. This is a learning process for me, but only YOU can prevent ~~forest fires~~ a total clusterfuck.

4) Profit!

^# - This is a self-post, because I don't need your silly points for self-validation. No, really. I don't have self-confidence issues. STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT.

^## - Please really ask yourself what you would order and at what price point. Getting an accurate picture of what our order would look like plays a big part in figuring out which supplier we're going to use, so that we can include the most r/triathletes in our purchase.

EDIT1: I'm on the fence about regular cycling kit in our design. What are your thoughts?

Big drinker/smoker, high blood pressure, couldn't run a city block.
Here's me at 152lb's after finishing IRONMAN Arizona http://imgur.com/oo3Bn

The last 4 years were in no way linear and Ironman was never the goal (until last year). This was my progress...

    Jan 2009 Weight loss competition. Diet: Modified 4hr body. Routine:mostly cardio with some machine work. I was working out in a clubhouse gym, so options were limited. Went from 210-180lb in 3 months. Quit smoking

    June 2009 Join a 24hr gym. More resistance training, but a pretty BS routine. Had some strength gains, but also some weight gain as I was still drinking beer daily (8+ easily). Switched from eliptical to treadmill running.

    Feb 2010 First 5k. 33min

    March 2010: Join Lifetime Fitness. Start Spinning 2-3 times/week. Lifting 6 days week.

    Feb 2011 1st 1/2 Marathon 2:0X:XX

    May 2011 Find Fittit. Stop BS'ing in the gym and start lifting. Dropped the curls, calf raises...etc.., added squats, deadlifts, pullups...all the good stuff fittit has taught me.

    Nov 2011 Sign up for IMAZ 2012. Stop drinking during the week.

    Dec 2011 Bought road bike

    Feb 2012 First Marathon 3:5X:XX

    April 2012 First triathlon. 1/2 Ironman 5:3X:XX

    Nov 2012 Ironman Arizona 11:1X:XX

    Advice (for what it's worth)

    Find a diet with food you like. I still eat chicken, eggs, and black beans every day.

    Start doing the big compound lifts

    Interval training works

    You can be an Endurance Athlete on a low carb diet. I did 75% of my IM training on less than 120 carbs/day.

    Stopping drinking really takes off the pounds.

A sincere thanks to you Fittit. Couldn't have done it without you.

1369155282.0,74,self.triathlon,1eruei,Report from a midnight finisher (long).,77,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1eruei/report_from_a_midnight_finisher_long/,"I did my first full distance race this weekend (HITS Grand Junction). Things did not go according to plan. But I thought y'all might find some interest in this report I wrote up for friends and family anyway. Note that it's intended for a non-triathlete audience, and also that 'G' is my wife. And by the way, the event was brilliant. Y'all should do a HITS race.




It's after 8:00pm in Highline State Park, Colorado. The sun is down, twilight is fading, the air is chilly. The finish line of my first iron-distance triathlon is about 100 yards away. I haven't eaten in about five hours or been able to hold down fluids for three, but the finish is right there.

What a pity that I've only done one half of the run and still have 13 miles to go. 13.1, to be precise. At my current pace that's at least another three hours. Probably more. Three hours alone in the dark and cold and likely rain, and for what? To say I did it? Finished a triathlon in a time suitable for the elderly and infirm? What kind of sense does that make?

So I turned my back on the finish line and my lovely wife and set off into the night. Because that was the plan, and the plan is important.

The day started very, very well. The swim was a delight. I'd been worried for weeks about how cold the water was going to be. Hypothermia could end my day before it even got started. But it turns out 63 degree water is perfect (in a full wetsuit and neoprene swim cap, anyway). The sun shone, the water was mirror smooth. I swam straight, knew where I was going, and just felt fantastic the whole time. I came out of the water in one hour thirty minutes, precisely according to plan, and I knew then I was going to make it. The rest of the day was just a formality; the swim was the only thing that could defeat me, and it was behind me.

As it turns out, that was one hell of a formality ahead of me, but I didn't know it at the time.

I took my time changing into bike kit, putting on sunscreen casually, strolling through transition. No need to try to save seconds when I was looking at a 14 hour day. Maybe 13 if things went really well. The plan was to take it easy on the bike, save my big effort for the finishing run. So off I set at a nice easy pace, aiming for for a 3:30 first lap of the bike course.

My great day was continuing as I set off. The bike felt wonderful, my legs loose. It was a relatively small event, only 59 people doing the full distance (some 200+ were doing the half, but since they only swam half the distance they were long gone down the road), so I was mostly alone, but everyone I passed or who passed me had a smile and a nod. Once we were clear of the ""town"" of Mack I settled into my aerobars and started grinding along, grinning. What a day!

About twenty miles in a woman I'd passed a few miles back caught me on a slight downhill. She appeared to be quite a bit older, and what with her being a girl and all my ego gave a bit of a throb as she passed. But she returned the smile I gave her when I passed earlier and said, ""I bet we'll be seeing a lot of each other today!"", and I decided to be smart and ride my own pace instead of chasing her down.

It turned out she was faster than me downhill or with the wind; I was faster uphill or into the wind. Since the course was twisty and rolling, she was right: we saw plenty of each other as we swapped places repeatedly. About the fourth time we exchanged names. She was Bev, short for Beverly, and we were best buddies now. Unfortunately triathlon rules forbid riding together, so our friendship was developed in very short bursts as we passed each other, but we were definitely getting along.

Ten miles later, the course turned into a long, straight uphill drag of about fifteen miles. It wasn't very steep, but there was a bit of a headwind, so my pace fell off dramatically, to about 12 mph. But what's uphill into the wind going would be downhill with a tailwind coming back, and my GPS said I was still on track for my plan, so I just settled down and kept turning the pedals and smiling.

Near the top I had a near disaster when the cleat on one of my shoes worked loose. Suddenly I was ice-skating on the pedal and almost went down; then I realized I couldn't get the cleat out of the pedal, since it just twisted freely. I had to teeter to a stop and take the shoe off my foot, leaving it attached to the bike, before I could work on it.

Luckily the cleats have three bolts each; I'd lost two on one shoe (heaven knows how - I'd actually checked them specifically the night before) but I could spare one from the other shoe, and I had a multi-tool to do the job, so I sat down roadside for a quick repair job. Soon enough Bev caught up. She looked mighty concerned to see me stopped, but I explained I was fine and she ground on up the hill while I finished up.

A couple of miles later I reached the top of the hill, where two very enthusiastic volunteers manning the aid station gave me a little victory dance and some fresh water, and then the payoff for the hard uphill grind: fifteen miles of flying downhill. I even managed to keep Bev in sight, and finally caught her when the road turned uphill again five miles from the turnaround point halfway through the ride.

I hit the turnaround after 3:33 on the bike. Three minutes behind schedule, but there'd been some wind and I'd had the cleat adventure, so the plan was still definitely working. I shocked the aid station volunteers by sitting down for a few minutes and eating a sandwich with my lovely wife. I'd promised myself a sandwich halfway through the bike and even though I wasn't very hungry, I was sticking to the plan. The plan is important.

I was feeling great as I set off again, but seeing the trees beginning to move a little more in the wind, I told G I might be a bit slower on the second lap of the course. Maybe half an hour slower, I said, if this wind kept up.

Oh boy, did it ever keep up. It kept up, and up, and up, and pretty soon it was a 30 mph headwind. That extra half hour turned into an extra hour and a half. The downwind bits were delightful of course, but far too brief, and that fifteen miles of uphill into the wind? Well, delightful that was not. Dust devils kept whipping at me across the open plain as I struggled to maintain 5 mph. Tumbleweeds flew by, and to add to the fun lightning kept flashing on the horizon. You do the math: 15 miles at less than 10 mph is... eternity. Better yet, my stomach had decided to turn on me. Food was not going in any more. Racked with nausea and buffeted by wind, I strongly considered quitting. But... the plan. The plan is important. So I kept turning the pedals, and eventually, somehow, I got back to the enthusiastic volunteers at the turnaround. They were a little more subdued now, but when I said I was now doubtful about finishing it, the bald one said, ""No fucking way, man! You walk it if you have to, you crawl, but you are finishing!"" It seemed rude to let him down, and the next bit was indeed downwind. So off I went, dutifully.

After a mile or two I passed Bev, who was still heading up. She was walking her bike, looking grim, but she signaled me OK, so I yelled something inane like ""Stay strong!"" and rode on.

At one point on that return I wasn't pedaling, just sitting up and letting the wind do the work, when a support motorcycle pulled up next to me. He paced me for a minute then yelled, ""You're doing 30!"". ""No way,"" I said, but a glance at my GPS confirmed it.

I made it back to the transition area after over 8:30 on the bike. Probably the slowest century I've ever ridden, and that's counting my very first one, when I was still a smoker and lit up on the bike. Worse yet, the plan, the sacred plan, was in real danger now. I was meant to get off the bike feeling good for the run, but instead I was shelled. My nausea had improved, but not enough to eat. My legs were wrecked. Run a marathon? Now?

But G was having none of it. I don't remember exactly what she said, my brain having shut down, but next thing I knew I was breaking into a weak little jog as I headed out on the first lap of the run and she cheered behind me.

I'd been dreaming of chicken broth for the last hour, because the race organizers had said it would be available on the run course, and for some reason that sounded like the best thing in the world. At the first aid station, a mile and a half in, I asked hopefully, ""Chicken broth?"". ""No,"" the nice volunteer said, ""I'm afraid we're out. Something else?""

""Something else?"" I mumbled, crestfallen, ""I guess... I'll just have this grape. That'll be fine. Just a grape.""

So I took a grape and shuffled off tragically.

Five minutes later a truck pulled up. ""You the guy who needs the chicken broth?""

You know, I may not have made this clear before, but the organizers and volunteers at this event were *stellar*. Freaking chicken broth on demand. How much more can they do for a guy? Maybe run for me? ""Hell yes!"" I said, and it was hot and salty and delicious.

Unfortunately about five minutes later (mercifully after the kindly volunteer was out of sight) my stomach decided it would be better hot, salty, and outside me. That was the last thing I swallowed that day.

But the plan wasn't quite lost yet. For some reason my brain was still working. I could count and add and stuff, and I figured out that if I could average 13 minutes a mile for this first lap, I would be able to finish before the midnight cutoff if I could then average 15 minutes a mile for the second lap. And experiment proved I could walk at 15 minutes per mile. Not an easy saunter, but a walk.

All I had to do was to run 13 minute miles for an hour and a half and then I could walk the rest of the way. It was a plan. Not the plan I started with, but a plan. Plans are important.

And by God, that was the plan I executed. Exactly.

There was a weird moment on the second lap when, having been walking for nearly two hours alone, convinced I was dead last, a guy suddenly caught me. He was running, looking fresh. Where the hell did he come from? Then two more - then three behind them. Having not seen a soul except aid station volunteers for miles and miles, suddenly it was a traffic jam. Pretty soon all those inexplicable runners dropped me and I was alone again. Looking at the results, I have no idea where they went. There aren't enough people who finished in the right timeframe to account for all of them. Maybe I hallucinated them. I was, after all, just waiting for my brain to shut down, the staggering to start, the collapse - I'd far outrun my abilities. I had no idea what was fueling me. But my little mental checks coming up positive: I could still count, and add, and even divide. I could remember my phone number, and dammit, I could still walk a 15 minute mile.

A couple of miles past the turnaround I saw Bev. She was jogging determinedly, looking better than I was, but four miles back? My relentless mental calculator told me she'd need something pretty special to finish before midnight, probably more than was realistically possible. Still, I gave her some dumb platitude (""Looking good!"") and she just gave me a grim smile back. Apparently she could still do math too.

So I walked and wondered how I was doing it and I walked some more and then eventually I was gingerly picking my way to the finish (the last 200 yards are across a dam wall; it's 12 feet wide, but there were klieg lights in my eyes from the finish line and I wasn't very trustful of my abilities, so falling off seemed like a very real possibility). Mark, the race director, was calling encouragement and when I finally replied G, who was with him, exclaimed with relief and it was obvious how worried she'd been. I power-walked through the finish line (what on earth would be the point of running now?), the race announcer woke up with a start to announce to the three of us present that I was finishing, someone handed me a medal, and that was it.

I didn't see Bev finish (I was having a chat with the nice paramedics at that moment) but G tells me she came in at three minutes after midnight. She must have put in a hell of an effort to come that close. Apparently she rejected the medal they offered her, saying she hadn't earned it. But they listed her as an official finisher anyway, unlike the others who didn't make it (over 50% of the starters, by the way). I've spent probably a total of two minutes interacting with her, but I think she might be a better man than me. I would probably have taken their pity medal.

So. Nearly two years of planning and training. Done. It may not have been as I planned it, but I found a way. For such a weak just-barely-made-it result, it feels pretty damn good. And now - flyfishing. Flyfishing sounds like a pretty good hobby. Or maybe shuffleboard.

We love doing these events and a lot of us have nice equipment to show off that we saved to acquire and bought after a few, if not a lot of races. 

You do not need long hours of training and a nutritional plan to do an entry level triathlon.  There is nothing to be scared of. You could probably not use a wetsuit, have a mountain bike 26er and old running shoes and still finish in time with little training in most distances that don't include ironman in the title. 

Triathlons are friendly and competitive in a way unlike most other sports. You are racing yourself.  

It's ok to be slow beginning or just in general. Enjoy the race.  Use your old bike that's laying around a few times instead of budgeting for a new bike before your first race. You'll make personal records that you'll continually  break as you get better. 

I wanted to post this because I see a lot of people looking to get into triathlons and they're trying to figure out which new bike to buy for their first race; or what type of nutrition they should take before/during the race.  I wanted to say slow down, enjoy the event, push yourself and have fun. There's plenty of races in the future to qualify for Kona or whatever you're wanting from triathlons.

Hi!

To start off I'd like to say thanks for all the information this and other subreddits like /r/Swimming, /r/running, and /r/bicycling  have given me. I'm training hard for my first sprint tri which is a in a little over a month, still unable to swim the distance of 500 yards, let alone in open water. I've been working hard on my other 2 disciplines hardly ever missing a day, but I'm not going as fast as I hoped. My diet has been lacking of recently, and I've gained a few pounds due to poor choices. (side story, I'm down from 245 lbs to 190 lbs at 6'4"" from last year, so really this Tri is my first chance to improve and test out my new vehicle). I always feel like I leave a little out there for next time when I train.

Today I received a text by the girlfriend of 4.5 years (we're both 24 years old) which read ""I have some concerns"". Long story short, she said she was convinced she wasn't making me happy, but I don't think she was happy with our relationship. We cried. I said goodbye; but it's got me thinking...

I'm not the old me anymore... This won't slow me down, she wont slow me down. I could be saying I deserve to sit down, watch some streams and eat some useless fast food until I fall asleep tonight, but I won't.  I could spiral into guilt and/or depression for a month or two, but I won't. This is an opportunity, a great one. This slight rage and massive emotions will be focused into something amazing, something extraordinary. No more half days, no more excuses.

Alarm set

I thought...well I've done a few 5ks. I just got a bike for riding around town. I'm an okay swimmer, maybe I could do that.

I find that married life has gone on with a sense of normality much as my single life has. Although I have started to think before breaking out my wallet and have chosen (wisely I might add) not to buy a new set of race wheel but just replace my tires.  With my brand new slicks for my tri bike in hand, I search my garage for my plastic levers to change them out. As luck would have it, I cannot find them anywhere.  Never to be defeated, I think of all the MacGyver episodes I have mindless absorbed.  After 15 mins of drinking beer and holding duct tape, it hits me.....SPOONS!  (Recalling too late from my childhood, this was always a sin that was punishable by my mother’s eager wooden spoon.  Heaven forbid I bend or mar the nice table ware.)  I race inside and raid the silverware drawer to find a few spoons with no ridges or designs on the handles.  With lightning speed, for fear that the wrath of a new wife can bring, I have the old tire off the front and the new tire reseated.  Half way through and in the clear I think as I start on the rear.  Then it hits me....the sound of the garage door opening.  The wife is home early, and I am here with her nice spoons wedged between the rim and the tire bead.  The slow motion sets in.  I see her mouth open and words start coming out.  ""Stop, what are you doing?  You are going to scratch and bend them!"" she says with a harsh voice.  Panicking, I do what every good husband is instructed and start rambling and mumbling how I am sorry and will replace the spoons.  As I prepare for the worst, she keep going on....not about the spoons, but the Rims!  She was not worried about the spoons but my rims.  She was more worried that I would scratch my rim, and could care less about her nice spoons.  I look at her and told her that I have the best wife in the world and I loved her.  I think we will work out fine.  ",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_s0uj8,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/s0uj8/the_newlywed_and_the_triathlete_husband/,

The Good:  I came out of the swim 2nd in my AG and in the top third overall, I felt great.  Nice fast transition and I got on my bike, my strongest discipline, and was rockin on the bike when:
The Bad: Rear tire blew!!!  Not a leak, but a blowout on mile 7 put me in the ditch. 
The Ugly:  Stupidly, because it was not a long ride, my tube and pump were on my bookcase at my house.  A year of work, 95 lbs lost, and I'm gonna DNF my tri!!! I felt about as demoralized as I could be.
Then something amazing happened.  People stopped their own race that they had put their own hours and hours into, and offered to help.  Not 1, not 2, but 3 people.  The first 2 did not have a tube or presta, but the third handed me his tube and his CO2!  The total time lost was about a half hour, but if he had not pulled over, I would have DNF'ed me first tri.  Finished the bike , less than 1min T2, and 2nd in my AG in the run, but the initial dissapointment actually allowed me to enjoy the moment and the race.  I'll also use this as fuel to win my AG there next year, that is, unless I see someone on the side of the road, Then I'm paying it forward.

First a disclaimer. I knew in advance what I had gotten myself into. I've watched all the videos, and read each report (in whatever form) that I could get my hands on. I will try to be as detailed as possible, so that it may help a future Norseman participant.

Second disclaimer: English is not my first language. I wrote an extensive report in my own language, and I google translated it. I ran it over, and made some changes. But it is less then perfect.

Third disclaimer: I tried to make it as ""anonymous"" as possible. I'd love to answer questions, i'll try to answer to the best of my abilities.

The Norseman has a great name. Mythical proportions, epic story. I'm (technically sitting / I lying down, but you understand what I mean) for you as someone who has been broken through this race and at the same time is also rebuilt by it.

Norseman: Point-to-point race in Norway, with 3100 meters altitude gain on the bike, and over 1500 meters of gain on the run. The organization provides (almost) nothing. You must take a support crew with it (in my case my father and my brother). The run finishes up on top of Gaustatoppen, 1880 meters. The last 5km is completely unpaved and sometimes with hands and feet. Your support team (in my case my brother) has to go up with you.

Firstly let me say that this is by far the hardest thing I've ever done in competition, this has taken more perseverance then I have ever encountered. You can not hide in the Norseman. There is no ""easy way out"".

For reference: i am a 6 time Irondistance finisher, with race results ranging from 8.41 to 9.24, with a top 20 finish at Ironman Frankfurt and a top 100 finish at Ironman Hawaii. 

I've been injured a lot this year and had my worst preparation ever. Had a stressfracture in my foot, was diagnosed with a toe without cartilage in spring, so i had to ""learn to run"" again because of correcting insoles this spring. Have a knee injury (tractus tendon) that bothers me during climbing on the bike, and the week before the race I blew my shoulder swimming.  

Ironman (or Iron Distance) is described as a test of character. If I'm honest, it usually isn't that bad for me. The distance is good for me. Quitting is not in my nature. I usually prepare well.

I was not prepared.

Not for this. For those who do not want a long story, here the TL, DR version:

4400 meter swim. Injured shoulder. Reasonable swimming. Bike start 35km climb to 1200m altitude. Then plateau where the wind comes from the front like crazy. Rain. My cycling gear soaked by a SC mishap. A short climb very hot. Then lots of rain, hail, fog and cold in the next climbs. Nauseous. Knee pain when climbing. After last climb ""False flat"". Again thunderous wind against 39/24-28 going forward. Long descent; puncture. New tube, air inside, immediately puncture again. No more tubes. Support Crew already in T2, 12km away. Called. Already underway. Received tyre from support crew of another athlete . 20 minutes along the of the road. Run quite hot. After 25km the climb starts; from 10%. Bizarre. Last 5 ""dirt road "", in other words scramble over rocks, sometimes with hands and feet. Finish in top 5%. Walk the 5km back down, because of failure of the lift. # BAM!

We left Wednesday to the North. The start was challenging, especially since i broke a piece of my aerobar when training hours prior. Fortunately, creative intervention by LBS/sponsor offered the solution. 

The trip was good. We slept in Ovre Eidfjord, a small hamlet a few kilometers outside the slightly larger hamlet Eidfjord, where the start is. Because it was around dinner time we decided to do in Eidfjord at Viks a bite. The setting is simply fantastic. The fjord water is crystal clear and impressive cliffs.

On the terrace we got the special Norseman menu. Elk Burger,awesome.

Elk. Burger.

Beware, Norway is expensive, for three burgers and a beer (for father) I paid € 75. Hadebra!

Friday: first the social swim. 0900 nice splash and sweetness ifrom contest sponsor United Bakeries. My brother also swims with me. A striking face, a powerlifter of 110kg that goes into the water barechested between ecto neoprene coated triathletes. 1-0 with respect to the psychological warfare.

After a good lunch and a nap, it's time for the race briefing. This is held in a large hall without chairs. And at the start is immediately clear that this is a race unlike any other. We listen for a minute or 10 to Norwegian vocals. Beautiful, goosebumps sometimes.

We are warned of dangerous road sections, weather and traffic.

The night is short, but good. A short drive brings me to the quay, the bike is installed. The ferry is ready. No escape. My shoulder feels soso and I hope I make it through the swim. Waiting for the ferry takes a long time. Many people tense, pacing back and forth. Then the cover comes down. I jump a little earlier than I intended, but happily the temperature of the water is not that bad. The field is small, so I hope as little hassle as possible. 

Swimming: 

The horn goes off and I start as controlled as possible. It is still dim, but the view is good. I have taken some painkillers, especially for the placebo function. Sweet delicious placebo. The water is not as nice as quiet as in the movies, and we have alot of wind. I can not swim full pull, but here I am very happy. Eventually out of the water in the top 5%. Afterwards I hear from several athletes that their gps indicated 4400 meters.

Cycling: 


Flat early on, but soon it goes up. It keeps going up and that keeps on in the 35 kilometers to come. I ride my rhythm at 39 * 28 and sometimes 24. The environment is really so impressive that it off-and-toe is difficult there to keep the focus. It's easy to get too hot to dress, and so I do.

Then we gat to Dyranut. This is the onset of the plateau. And what you can expect happened. A small hiccup in communication between supportcrew and me. I get my food and water bottles, but the clothing wasn't found. In the hectic pace of T1 my SC put the wetsuit in my bikebag and everything is soaking wet. Oops. In the miles that follow I stop 2 more times before I got a spare jacket.

It is cold and windy on top. My shoulders tense and the wind howls loud, mainly head on. It is clear that it is going to be a long day. The environment is alien and desolate. I then ask me for the first time, why am I doing this? Maybe for the last time?

Once in Geilo (pronounced G like a pregnant J!), It is again time for additional food. A nice diversion before the climbing starts again.

4 climbs, between 3 and 10 kilometers long, rising at rates up to 10%. Sweet. I still have long sleeves and that breaks me immediately. It's hot hill and after brief contact with the SC I give my jacket off. The descent is fine, but the second climb comes up fast and my knee gets worse too. I choose to get some pain relief and a bicycle shirt, which is complemented by the already wet windstopper. Following we get downpours and hail. Awesome....

And if it is supplemented with fog and it remains seriously cold i also get the arm and knee tubes on. Best choice ever! At that time, with the intense bad weather, I'm soaked. I'm very slow and I literally don't see a thing. During the descent I see nothing, with or without glasses, so hard, the rain / hail comes down. ""I quit triathlon moment 2"".

Only the last climb left. The climb to Immingfjell, one with a reputation. It's raining a little, but it also heats up. At Immingfjell your you're supposed to see a dam.  Supposed to, because I couldn't see a damn thing. Last moment with the SC because you send them forward to T2 to get everything set up.

After Immingfjell there's a 10km ""False flat"" section and then A 30km descent. But then comes the most difficult moment.   You're so focused on the end of the climb, the end of the pain that wat comes next hits me hard. The false flat is very false. With small climbs and murderous wind. I feel like I'm going backwards. I'm quitting the sport. This is it. From now on only drinking beer. Really.

But stopping right then and there is also not an option. The descent is fast, with a few dangeroushairpins, especially if you can't see a thing. The road surface is bad. 

Than 12km before T2. Blowout. I steer to the side of the road and i suppress Wiggins-like impulses. I also doubt whether I have such a beautiful throw in me. A new tube in, cartridge out. Again bam! The shit now sits firmly on the fan. I call my support crew and the connection is very bad. Perfect. Luckily they understood. They are on their way.

Then the Norseman solidarity comes into action. Crew Car and 2 cars from other athletes stop. The last one has a spare tube. I am careful inflating and i'm good to go!. End result: 20 minutes alongside the road. Quickly i pass my SC, who have almost arrived at my location. Luckily they have the drivers skill to overpass me and make it to T2 before me. Excellent!!

At that time, the pressure is off. In my head alot of people have passed me (the did not) and a top 10 position is out of sight (not true). At this time, racing is no more. It's about finishing.

T2: You ride your bike straight into T2, why not, eh?

Run:

As bad as I felt, so light feel my legs. Great! I talk to myself just to go easy, and run easy. The road is anything but flat. Rolling is a better word. It's hot,certainly in the valley.

I see my SC regularly and get enough gels and drinks inside. But, after overtaking an athlete in the first 5km, I see noone. Very occasionally, very far away, an athlete is in sight.  After about 20km you will see the mountain for the first time. Shrouded in fog, though. Scary sh # t.

Then you are at checkpoint 1. 25km. Zombie Hill can begin. I run as long as possible. But I don't have the strength or the courage. I'm walking with a brisk pace. Still faster than the two athletes in fornt of me that have suddenly appeared. But I gain agonizingly slow. At the checkpoint they provide water, bananas and a cup with salty liquorice and sausage. Special combo. 

The miles go by agonizingly slowly. 28, 30, 32. Then there's checkpoint 2. Still no idea where I lie in the race, but the black shirt is in the pocket. The road is steeper than any movie can express. Walking up, my heart still goes up to Z2 / 3. Here they also tell us that the lift is broken. So everyone (including athletes) will walk back down. All we needed.

The roads leveles off towards the last checkpoint at 37.5km. I try to run, but could've done more and longer. I overtake 2 athletes.


My brother is ready with my backpack. The backpack is my lifeline in case of an emergency. Warm clothes, food, drink, headlight. He's ready. We're going. Suddenly there are a lot of athletes around! A Norwegian athlete which was with me the whole time around, takes off. Weird to see it, so smooth. Eventually took 10 minutes out of me. Amazing!!

For me, the race is over. Now just go up. I let my brother make the pace, it is difficult to find a rhythm without a path. Through the mist we do not really know where we're going. We pass the first woman. I congratulate her, but she can not talk. Moments later, the later female winner passes her (and me), and leaves us standing like spectators. So smooth she flies up the mountain. The path is sometimes invisible and impassable, hands and feet simultaneously. Perhaps i should have put on sturdier shoes for the last part. But then suddenly the finish. I am there....


The finish is rather small, and after a while chat with a few other athletes I get tapped on my shoulder. Someone from the Race Crew. Or maybe I could eat my waffle and * nudge nudge *. I ask if he's kicking me out. ""Kind of,"" he answers with a smile on his face. There are a lot of athletes coming.

We walk down. My Iron Sherpa acts first as leaning post, and that helps battleling the pain in the thighs. Slowly they heat up again. It's pretty cold the first few kilometers, but the more we descend the better it gets. More than 2 hours it takes us. Wow. The Pringles of an unsuspecting tourist on the way help me through it.

The local pizza tastes good. The bed is delicious. The black t-shirt is even better.

Epilogue:

The morning after I was convinced that I would never come back. Broken, too heavy, etcetera. In the afternoon I knew better. This time the mountain was the boss of me, that must change. I will come back .There is nothing like this, this is like really addictive drugs.

1347976419.0,43,self.triathlon,102ua1,IRONMAN Wisconsin 2012 Race Report - wall of text,47,4,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/102ua1/ironman_wisconsin_2012_race_report_wall_of_text/,"**Morning of the Race**

Slept surprisingly well, but I was wide awake when the 4am alarm went off. Laid in bed for 30 minutes or so, then ate breakfast in bed (bagels with peanut butter), and finally got dressed. I kept feeling like I was missing something, but having dropped off my bike, T1, and T2 bags the day before, and prepping my special needs bags the night before, there really wasn’t a lot I needed that morning. My girlfriend, Kristen, dropped me off at the Capitol and then went back to the hotel so she could take the shuttle back. I dropped my special needs bags off and strolled down to my bike. It was chilly, low 50s, and the whole area had a “peaceful hum” to it. I’m used to shorter races where there’s lots of activity and energy as people are excited. But the length of the Ironman means there’s no point in getting amped up at 6am because it’ll be dark again before you cross the finish line. Got to my bike, filled the tires, filled my aero bottle, and mixed my CarboPro bottle (was advised not to mix it the night before). Felt like I needed to do more, but the usual stuff you leave with your bike was already in the conference center in colorful bags, so after five minutes at my bike I decided to head down to the swim start area. I used the port-a-potty when I got down to the swim start and didn’t have to wait, but when I left it there was a short line, and after I got my wetsuit mostly on there was a line of about 5 people per port-a-potty. I’m used to being slightly “behind the curve” of people at race starts, so it was nice to finally be ahead of the crowd. It was 6:20, so I spent the next few minutes trying to get a hold of Kristen to let her know where I was so I could see her before starting. By 6:30, it didn’t seem like she’d get there, but I found my cousin, and was able to hang out with her while waiting. At 6:40, I got Kristen on the phone and was able to talk with her, and we realized there’d be no way for her to get to me in time. I was disappointed, naturally, but out of nowhere I just slumped down and started crying. I didn’t realize how important it was to me to see her before starting, but the reality of it sunk in and I was a wreck. Thankfully, it was close enough to the start that I was able to distract myself with getting into the water to help me move on. I got in the water at 6:45, did a little warm up swim and positioned myself. I found a spot and floated in place for 10 minutes, not thinking about the race, just thinking about how many people there were in the water, watching the race, and just being amazed at the scale of it all. I’ve always heard the key to endurance racing is compartmentalizing the race into achievable sections. Don’t think about the whole Ironman; just think about the swim, or just getting to the first turn, etc. I struggled with this during half-Irons, but for this race, all I could think about was just getting to the first buoy, nothing else. This made me extremely calm in the midst of so much energy, excitement, and anticipation.

**Swim**

At 7:00am, the cannon went off and I started swimming. Thankfully I’d forced myself into the second row of swimmers right next to a boat ramp of sorts, so I didn’t have to worry too much about waiting for people to start. I’m a strong swimmer who is used to small races and/or wave starts, so I’m used to getting to the front of the pack quickly; this start was very different. Around 2500 people, all starting at once, and those around me having my same goal; get out front. I had a swim goal time of 1:00, but after the first few minutes of the swim, I knew that wouldn’t be possible simply due to all the time I lost trying to get my own lane to swim in without getting kicked, elbowed, or smacked. So I dropped all goals and just focused on getting to the first buoy. I knew I was doing well when I got to the buoy and didn’t get much of any interference going around it. I am a right-side breather, so having Monona Terrace to look at every other breath was nice, and allowed me get some energy from all the spectators. However, after the first buoy, my only view was John Nolan Drive and then the rest of the lake; I felt isolated for the first time, and the enormity of the race was starting to set in. Thankfully (in a way), someone decided to swim over top of me at that moment, which helped me to focus on not drowning and finding my stroke again, and get back to compartmentalizing the race. I started to think what my time would be and figured I’d probably come in right around 1:05. I kept swimming and my arms felt strong and comfortable. I was hugging the buoy line, which came at a price. Probably 2/3 the way through the swim, someone came out of nowhere and kicked my head which caused my cap to fly off. Quick 20 second break to put it back on and I was swimming again. I kept glancing at the next buoy hoping it was, only to see another one even further away. When it finally was the turn, it meant we were heading back to shore, which excited me; first leg almost done! The final turn took us on a diagonal path towards the swim finish, and I accelerated slightly, hoping I’d meet my new goal, but my arms protested so I just stayed in my rhythm. As I got out of the water, I felt great. I saw my watch and it read 1:05:??. I don’t remember the seconds because it didn’t matter, I’d met my new on-the-fly goal!! My legs felt great, my lungs felt great, and my arms felt like I could have kept swimming. I was elated. Wet suit strippers yanked my suit off and I started the jog to T1. Out of nowhere, I see Kristen and my parents cheering me on and taking pictures. They were in the front of the crowd in probably the best spectating real estate you could have. I beamed at them and kept jogging towards the helix. In hindsight, I wish I would have hugged Kristen, but I was so focused on the race, it slipped my mind until a couple miles into the bike. I jogged up the three-story helix with people cheering all around me and I just couldn’t stop smiling. It’s nice when you’re out of the water with a smaller group; there aren’t tons of people around you so it feels like they’re all cheering just for you. I got my T1 bag and a volunteer yelled “ZOOM, OVER HERE” and I followed him (my coaching is through Zoom Performance, and my tri top advertised that fact). I recognized him from a training camp earlier in the year, but couldn’t remember his name, but he was great at helping me get all my stuff organized and where it needed to be. I grabbed my shoes and ran out of T1 ready to bike (stopping at the sunscreen station, no sunburn for this guy). Got my bike and was off.

**Bike**

The first few miles of the bike were a blur; I was focused on getting my heart rate down to Z2, taking stock of how I felt overall, and just trying to stay warm as I was soaking wet and had a 58 degree wind blowing over me. My first memory of the bike was around mile 2 where a guy passed a bunch of us on a turn and then instantly got a flat on his disc wheel. He probably had an $8,000 bike rig and that flat cost his every time advantage a disk wheel and aero helmet would give him, and then some; I felt bad for him, but it made me glad I listened to my coach and avoided renting race wheels for the day. As a strong swimmer and weak cyclist, you get used to being passed a lot on the bike, but the first 20 miles of the bike was a whole new level; I would have groups of 10 riders pass me at once. Every time they passed and I got tempted to follow, I just looked at my HR and chanted my race mantra, “race your own race.” I was making good time for me, and was sticking to my race plan as best as possible. About 1:00 into the bike, my stomach just quit accepting food and fluids. I had this happen at Kansas 70.3 earlier in the year, but that was due to me pushing it was too hard on the bike. But since my heart rate had yet to break into Z3, I knew that wasn’t the cause and struggled to work it out. I finally decided I’d inadvertently drank a bunch of lake water during the swim and my stomach was just full, which was confirmed when I stopped to pee for a very long time at mile 20 (I’m not going for Kona, so I never peed on the bike). I stopped at the aid station in Mount Horeb and chewed a handful of Tums from my 911 bag (band aids, Tums, Pepto, etc), which I don’t think helped much, but it was worth a try. I also mixed a new bottle of CarboPro while chewing on the Tums. I had water bottles filled with unmixed CarboPro, and I planned on mixing them when I needed them to avoid the extra weight on the hilly course. Well, after the first stop took me three minutes to fill up the bottle and mix it, I realized how stupid this plan was and got mad at myself for costing me at least five minutes on the bike by taking time to mix the bottles instead of just riding with them full. The world of triathlon puts so much focus on shaving every little gram from your bike that you don’t realize just how ridiculous it can get sometimes until a moment like that happens. Riding from Mount Horeb to “the Two Sisters” (two hard, back to back climbs) was pretty uneventful. The first “sister” is a long climb that’s not too steep. It’s a winding road, so the crappy part about it every corner you turn you think it’s the last turn, only to see more climbing. There were a few people on the bottom, but towards the top it got really crazy. I crested it feeling good, took some water, and coasted a little preparing for what I knew was the harder of the two climbs coming up. The second “sister” is shorter than the first, but a lot steeper. When I saw this hill it looked like the Tour de France. There were so many spectators I was almost riding the center line of the road just to have enough room. I saw Kristen, my parents, and a bunch of Zoom people cheering me on. Felt great cresting it as I knew it was mostly downhill for the next 5-10 miles (except for the third “step-sister”, which is a short and very steep climb). Got to special needs, grabbed what I needed and moved on. Was running on a 2nd wind and felt great! Was riding strong, feeling better now that I could eat and drink again, so I focused on how to best catch up my calories without over-eating too much. The wind had picked up some, but little did I know that it was actually 10-15mph winds now, and the valleys we were riding through were funneling it into our faces quite efficiently. The hill into Mount Horeb is probably the toughest climb, but since it’s early into the loop it doesn’t get as much “press” as the “sisters.” It’s a gradual hill for a mile or two approaching Mount Horeb, then it’s a long climb into the city itself (think walking up a hill with stairs at the top). This hill sapped my 2nd wind and I mumbled to myself “now I’m in survival mode.” Leaving Mount Horeb is Witte Road, which takes you directly north towards Cross Plains. It’s a very exposed road going through fields, so it’s really miserable when it’s hot (which it was at the camp earlier in the year, but thankfully not today). The road is nonstop hills, and most are pretty steep, though since they’re so close together you can use some downhill speed to help you up somewhat. This is my least favorite part of the course, and the last thing I wanted to do right after losing my 2nd wind. But, I trudged on, and hit my highest heart rate of the day powering up the hills just to get them done and gone. After a nice downhill, I coasted through Cross Plains (took a second pee break, which made me feel good knowing I was hydrating well enough) and took it easy on my way to my second and final meeting with “the sisters.” I got up the first one just fine, but I was worried about the second. When I started going up the second, I saw Kristen again cheering me on. Then I saw my family, the Zoom crew, and my coach, who jogged up the hill with me. She gave me great words of encouragement and all my negativity melted away; I was riding high again on a 3rd wind (which took me all the way into the run). After I got to Verona and turned to head back to Madison, I met up with some riders and we kind of leap frogged each other the whole way back (we didn’t draft, we just had similar paces). There are some hills going back, nothing horrible, but they’re nothing to scoff at. We all joked the motto of the course should be “Just one more hill” because we heard it three different times, only to come up to another hill a few minutes later. Once I crossed over the highway and saw the Capitol, I switched into “get ready to run” mode; ate my last food, stopped drinking water, and increased my cadence slightly. Took the helix up nice and easy and hopped off my bike to head into T2, feeling surprisingly good. At the camp, Zoom’s head coach (who has done IMOO three times) told us how we should feel when going into T2; we should feel ready to get off the bike, tired, but not really fatigued. Well, I jogged into T2 on my 4th wind, got all ready, then was able to jog all the way to the run start and was even able to do some butt kicks to shake out my legs. I felt like crap on the bike at the end, but once I got off I realized I wasn’t tired, I just wanted to be off the bike.",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,Tri-Flair,True,t3_102ua1,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/102ua1/ironman_wisconsin_2012_race_report_wall_of_text/,

This is what I learned.,37,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1gv7t6/completed_my_first_sprint_triathlon_this_morning/,So i'm pretty good at running completed a marathon last month and have been working on my biking and swimming which i didn't really do much before.  Completed my first sprint it was 300m swim 16.1 bike and 3.1 run.  This was a really small fundraiser race for a local pool.  The swim went great finished at 5:42 faster then i planned and it was hard running to t1 i was suprised.  Then putting my socks and bike shorts on probably looked hilarious.  I went trhough it in my head multiple times but I ended up looking like an idiot falling over trying to put everything on in a rushed panic but i managed to do it pretty quick.  Then the bike I pushed really hard my bike is pretty weak I usually bike at about 18mph if i really push in central pa we have a lot of hills so that messes with my average mph. I finished just under an hour at i think about 57 minutes. The problem is i had to ride about 2.5 to 3 miles on a flat in the front.  Made it a little harder but i suck at changing tires so i knew it would be faster to lean back and ride it and it wasn't to bad.  Then t2 was fast just slipped my shoes on and off.  The first part of the run was up a big hill and down.  Right off the bat it hit me hard and I quickly realized how hard it is to going from all out biking to all out running.  My breathing was tough my lungs were killing me it was so hard.  Hardest run of my life and I was ready to puke coming back up the hill at the finish.  But I finshed without stopping with a final time of 1:32:32.  It was a ton of fun and can't wait for my next but I learned a ton especially with the run man that was hard.  I came in 3rd in my age group tho.  I know i went all out the entire time and don't think i could of finished any faster without puking unless I didn't get a flat again.  Thought r/triathlon would enjoy reading about my experience.  ,,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_1gv7t6,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1gv7t6/completed_my_first_sprint_triathlon_this_morning/,

1370881182.0,29,self.triathlon,1g1w0k,First triathlon ever - Olympic distance,33,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1g1w0k/first_triathlon_ever_olympic_distance/,"I highly recommend doing a Sprint triathlon before doing an Olympic. It was rough, I didn't know what to expect, but I finished with a 3:15. I then felt nauseous for 24 hours after the race while recovering. Did I finish: Yes. Was I conditioned enough: Probably not. Was I mentally prepared: No.

Going into the race:
I could do all the events individually with no problem. I had ridden a few 30+ mile rides, swam in HS and so it took no time at all to get more than the distance required, and trained up to 8 mile runs. My bike is a simple hybrid, but I figured a mile an hour boost wouldn't be worth dropping $1000+ when I could get this same gain by getting in better shape. I went in with no wetsuit.

**Day of the race:** 

Swim - Water temp was 65 degrees, which was cold without a wetsuit, but not huge issue. I was fine after 5 minutes. I finished the swim within a minute of my goal of 25:00. 

Bike - The path was hilly and windy. It didn't go to badly. I thought to myself a pace of 15 mi/hr would be sustainable for my first triathlon, and hit an average pace of 15.25. The problem I had was from a morale standpoint because people were blowing by me going 5 mi/hour faster. It was a constant mental game to remind myself this was my first triathlon and I was racing to finish.

Run - The run was tough. It was a trail-running route with rolling hills. My goal was 50 minutes, but I just busted an hour. What I hadn't anticipated was hills. Every time I went up a hill, my legs cramped, I had to stop, stretch, walk a few feet, and continue running. If I had done a sprint, I could have anticipated this.

Transitions: I don't care yet. I didn't rush, didn't lollygag. 


Final thoughts - The race went OK, all things considered. It wasn't my body's ability that held me back, but rather my mental preparation. Was I a bit under-trained, sure. The race would have gone smoother if I would have started with triathlon I knew I could do rather than one at the edge of my ability.

I was in the first wave of guys in the water. I don't have a wetsuit and I don't wear a watch, nor was I paying attention to any clocks there might have been. The first 200 meters were the toughest part of the race and after that I found my rhythm and it became a little easier. I race in my square suit from swim season and despite everyone else having wetsuits, I heard I was 19th out of the water (The race overall had 140-ish in our wave and 700+ total) I took a little long in transition because I lack tri cycling shoes and decided to put on socks. I quickly passed those who got out before me though. The bike course is uphill the 1st half and back down the 2nd. Rolling mostly. I passed a few guys and also got passed by the dudes on zipp wheels and $6k bikes, so I think I was sitting anywhere from 15-20th position. Around mile 5ish? there was a sharp downhill left turn with haybales lining the sides of the road to keep people from flipping over the rails and falling down the side. Unfortunately, some loose hay had gotten strewn over the course. I tried scrubbing speed but it was too late. My front tire slipped and I went down. Helmet 100% saved my life. Without a doubt I would be in critical condition or more likely dead. I immediately got back up and tried getting back on though. There was too much adrenaline to keep me from trying to race. But my tire bead slipped the rim and my chain fell off. A policeman stationed at the turn jogged over and offered assistance. It was at this point where the pain was overcoming the adrenaline and I started feeling it. One thing leads to another and soon I'm in the hospital for suspected concussion, road rash, and fractured ribs. Luckily no broken bones and no adverse symptoms of a concussion. My race was over though. My bike got trashed as well. I now need new shoes, a new helmet, new saddle, new pedals, and possibly a new rear wheel and crankset. Thankfully, I don't own an expensive bike so I'll be alright with that.

I loved every second of it. Running through the sand into transition was amazing. I know that without a doubt I'm hooked on this for a loooong time. I have 2 more tris this summer so I've got opportunities to redeem myself and win my age group. For a first race, even though I DNF'd, it was awesome. The other triathletes in transition before the race offered me some awesome tips and helped me calm my nerves.

I've been lurking about and reading as much as I could from you guys, trying to really get a grasp on how to train and really work on being a finisher.  8 months ago I started some pretty drastic life changes - comes with the territory when you date a runner, I guess.  Dropped 35 lbs and got pretty comfortable with a 5K distance running.

This morning I parked at transition at 0400, and by 1000, I was being cheered across the finish line.  It might have only been a sprint, and you guys probably read these threads constantly, but damn it I'm proud of myself.  I don't have an official time because I got hit pretty hard by the post race abdominal cramps, and we decided to leave instead of trying to jockey for a portapotty - but now I totally understand how you guys feel.  This is such a rush, and such a good time, that I think I'm hooked.

Oh, and today's my 28th birthday.  How's that for a celebration?

I don't post here much at all but I read this subreddit a lot. I mainly wanted to post because I had read a thread recently from someone recommending a sprint as a first tri and regretting doing an olympic. I'm really pleased I chose an olympic triathlon as my first one. It was very hard, but it was the right level of challenge.

I raced it this morning. It was the Chinook triathlon in Calgary, Canada. 1500m swim, 40k bike, 10k run. I'm 38, and I'm in reasonable shape for a casual runner and cyclist. My overall time was 2:52:20 and the times for the events were 00:28:51/01:21:43/00:54:28. I rode my Kona Jake the Snake cyclocross bike. We had a solid headwind on the way out and a corresponding tailwind on the way back for the ride.

This was a huge success for me and I went back and forth between loving it and promising myself I'd never do it again. I'm not scared of water nor nervous at all to be pushed under, but I went out too fast in the swim and had a hard time getting a groove. I felt a little claustrophobic in the wetsuit.. My calf cramped up too which is odd since I trained well for this distance and was well hydrated with electrolytes.

For preparation I swam twice a week with a tri class at my local Y with an awesome coach, and I rode and ran when I could. I ate oatmeal for breakfast and a bonk breaker bar an hour before the start. Then 1 gel after getting on the bike and 1 gel when starting the run, plus a couple of these citrus gel blob things that I can't remember the name of during the run.

I wanted to post because I'm excited, but also because since it was my first one I was really affected by everything I read. I wanted to post what I consider a success story in case some other ordinary dude is worried about his first triathlon. My body hurts in new and exciting ways right now.

Edit: I don't mean to presume that an olympic is the best choice for a first race, but rather that it can be a great choice for the right person.

TL;DR: olympic tri was awesome for my first one. It was hard, but satisfying.",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,1371340357.0,,,True,t3_1gf9ge,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1gf9ge/first_triathlon_complete_olympic/,

Anywho, seneior year of high school rolls around, and I am still FAT! I finally got my (now large) butt back in the pool but just could not shake the weight off. In college I ended up gaining my B.S. in nutritional sciences and losing over 50 lbs. Once I graduated, I realized I needed some type of physical activity in my life. Last June, I joined my local triathlon club. This past year has been one of the toughest, most incredible experiences of my life. I have met many inspirational people as well as the love of my life, I was able to coach swimming for a youth triathlon club and share my love for the sport. The bond of endurance athletes is one that can be unbroken, evidence by the boston marathon. 
In my first year I went from unable to run a mile without stopping to racing my first half marathon, then my first half ironman! Out of 4 races that I have done, I podiumed all but the half. Even though they were small, sprints, I am so proud of how far I have come!

Some observations, tips for other first-timers",29,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/112he4/trained_for_a_few_months_and_completed_my_first/,"Started getting back in shape mid July with the intentions of completing a triathlon this fall.  In July I was 215 lbs 6' 2"" and unable to swim a full lap at the pool.

Hadn't swam laps before in my entire life.  I really struggled at first... I was breathing every two strokes and felt like I was drowning.  I'd swim to the other side of the 25m pool and hold onto the edge as I caught my breath.  After a week of this I read online somewhere the idea of not kicking at all when learning to swim. It made a day and night difference... I could swim several laps without stopping and gradually added a slow kick back in (maybe two kicks per stroke).  Also, I found the idea of ""pushing your chest down into the water"" seemed to really help keeping the legs at the surface.

Biking and running were more straightforward... Ran 4 times/week and biked only 1 time a week (though for a longer distance usually 30-40 mi).  By October I had lost a little over 20 lbs.

I thought I was mostly prepared for the tri... I had bought shorts, packed a bag, went over my bike, etc but on the day before I realized that I had no wetsuit.  I checked the water temp and it showed an average temp of 62F for October... oops.  It was too late to get one, nor did I really want to pay for it as money is a little tight now.  To begin with, I wasn't really fully confident about the swim since it was my weak discipline and I also had never swam in open water.  After looking at the hypothermia chart I decided to at least try since I allegedly would have 2 hours before it set in.

I arrived to the race and was relieved immediately when I put my foot in the water... It felt refreshingly cool, not cold, and definitely not 62F. I would guess mid 70s.  I was one of only a handful not wearing a suit but the swim went well.  I started out a little too fast and had to switch to a side stroke for part of the time but completed it despite swallowing some saltwater... It seems that when swimming open water you need to turn your head a little further to breathe because of wind and waves.

My only tip for the bike leg for newbs like me would be to check and see if water is passed out during the bike leg (i assume it is for longer distances but i may be wrong)... It wasnt in this case and luckily I had read this beforehand and put a bottle on the bike.

Of course I didn't do any brick workouts before the race and it was an extremely weird feeling getting off the bike and starting the run... Had to concentrate to avoid falling over. The only thing I could compare it to is jumping on a trampoline for a period of time and then getting off and jumping up and down... I felt like I was running in slow motion.  I assumed I was jogging about a paltry 11:00 mi but looked down at my garmin watch and realized I was running a 7:30 (i usually run at about 8:50 - 9).  Forced myself to slow down since I knew 7:30 probably wasnt sustainable for me after the swim and bike.  

Ended up with 1:33:27. Event was .5 mi swim (15:46), 15.2 mi bike (48:15), and 3.1 mi run (26:32).  Swim seems to be the worse so will be hitting the pool more this winter.  All said, it was a great time and everyone was so supportive and friendly.  To anyone who is considering doing one I really recommend it.

This post has been a long time coming. Last summer I wanted to make some serious life changes including quitting smoking, drinking less alcohol and getting in shape. I decided that my goal would be to complete an Olympic triathlon. Mind you I have never run, biked or swam any considerable distance. I announced this decision to my family and was surprised when my dad told me he wanted to join me (he is 68). It really turned out to be a blessing because both of us just completely threw ourselves into training. We shared resources and trained together when we could and generally just had a great time with it and became much closer because of it. We trained for the race for about 8 months total. During that time I also did a sprint tri for practice along with a 10K and a half marathon, but I always kept the Olympic as my main goal. We completed the race last month, my dad got first in his age group (he was the only one !) with a time of 3:27 and I got 12th in my age group (30-34) with a time of 2:28. We were both extremely happy with the race and can't wait to do another.

I learned a lot from the community here at /r/triathlon and just wanted to say thanks for all the good info. I also wanted to share a couple things I learned going from zero to Olympic without any real background.

One of the things I heard a lot about triathlon is that it is too expensive and truth is it can be. However I try to think about it in terms of how much enjoyment I get out of it vs the cost of it. It also helps that I am not spending money on alcohol or smokes anymore.

The first thing I would recommend would be to do your research. Get yourself some books and read as much online as you can. I feel I benefited immensely from learning how to run, bike and swim correctly before I decided to try to go fast. Personally I took a lot from Chi Running and Total Immersion swimming. As far as my cycling went, one of the best things I did was to find some ridiculously steep hills in my neighborhood and ride up and down them repeatedly. I think this increased my overall fitness more than any single other thing I did.

Another piece of advice would be to get swimming instruction if you can afford it. I was able to take a few private lessons and it made all the difference in the world. And my Dad swears by his Masters class. I was lucky enough to live next to the ocean so I did the majority of my swim training in open water, but I made sure to refine my technique in the pool (I still have a lot more to practice). Lastly I would say that stretching, foam rolling and icing after my runs made a big difference in my recovery. Since I was such a noobie to the sport, my body wasn't ready to handle all that punishment, but the stretching and foam rolling helped me with my recovery. I definitely over-trained in the beginning and suffered a couple injuries because of it, so make sure you listen to your body.

Anyways, the journey up until this point has completely changed my life for the better. I can't remember a time that I felt as good as I do today and I really look forward to setting more physically challenging goals ( I think a HIM might be in the cards for next spring).",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_jdvm4,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/jdvm4/after_8_months_of_training_my_dad_and_i_completed/,

I was never quite fast on the short distance, and never really had the conditioning for the longer runs. I've never ran more than 5 kilometers, but have also never really focused on running. I've done a lot of other sports, and used to be in the gym 5 days a week, before I set my goal for this year: an OD Triathlon. Running is something I know I have to work on. This morning was supposed to be a test 10km run, to see how it feels. I woke up, had a light breakfast (apple juice with my creatine, multivitamines, fish oil and a peanutbutter sandwich), waited for 20 minutes and went outside to start the run.

Within 500m it felt like my breakfast was going to come back out through the same hole it had entered shortly before.

I was sitting against a tree to get my stomach to settle when I looked around. The weather was beautiful, the woods I was running in were vibrant with life after the last few days of alternating sun and rain had given plants and flowers the fuel they needed to start growing, and the people walking around looked happy. Some were throwing a tennis ball only to go fetch it themselves when the dog decided there were more interesting things to do that day, others were clearly couples very much in love slowly wandering through the green pastures, and quite a number of them were runners training for their own big goals.

I put the distance I wanted to run out of my mind, and started jogging further into the woods. Accompanied by some deep house I set a decent pace and before long the Runkeeper lady told me I had been running for 25 minutes, for a total distance of 5km. It felt like I was only just warming up, so instead of turning back to run the full circle for a total of 10km I figured I might as well keep running. After moving to a new house only 6 weeks ago, I'd never really seen what was further up the road, and this was a good chance to go and explore. The first set ended (Monkey Safari Live), and one of my favorites came on (Homework @ Le Bain - Standard Hotel), I kept going and before I knew it the Runkeeper lady told me I'd been running for 55 minutes, for a total of 10km.

Wew, mission accomplished. That wasn't too bad. Let's keep going.

Past Sunday I was discussing whether or not it was possible to go from never having run more than 5km in my life to a 10 mile race in the first week of June. My dad was adamant it wouldn't be possible. It requires more training. I wanted to see if I could do it, just to prove that running is a mental game more than anything else. So I kept going. I started noticing that I was never actually out of breath, and that the limiting factor seemed to be the amount of punishment my legs could endure. On we went. The lady kept reminding me every 5 minutes that I was indeed still moving forward. 11km, 12km, 13km, 14km, 15km all came and went. Then came the magic words: 1 hour 35 minutes, distance: 16.58km. Ten miles.

I'll be damned if I stop now. Every year in The Hague, they have the City - Pier - City, an amazing running event which has the half marathon as its main event. I've been watching this event and participating in the 5km run for a long time, and had always thought it would be so cool to run in the main event. I wanted to see if I would be able to accomplish that distance, I didn't really care if I had to crawl for the last 2 kilometers.

Things started to hurt, but the summer had penetrated my mind to an extent where I stopped caring about the pain. Few more kilometers, and I was there. Liberation came at 2 hours, 5 minutes. Distance: 21.2km. Half a marathon.

This morning taught me two valuable lesson:

* My perceived limits are both mental and self-imposed
* My running shoes are a little on the small side",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_1dzv39,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1dzv39/breaking_the_barriers_my_epiphany_run/,

This past weekend I finally completed my first Triathlon. I was a modest starting Sprint with a 600 yd open water lake swim, 11 mile bike ride and 5k run to cap it off. This race was point I have been holding as a target goal destination after which I would decide my next round of goals and it's a journey that started for me back on October 31 of last year when I started the effort of weight loss and living a healthier lifestyle. In that time I have lost 76 lbs and gone from being a computer gaming chair potatoe to an active, yet still obese, triathlete. As organized events go, in the intervening time I have completed both a 5k and a 10k mud run and completed a regular 5k running race. The most I have biked in one go is 25 miles and I am regularly running a 10k distance 3 times a week. I am also currently swimming a non-stop mile in the water twice a week. 


Now that I have the past goals behind me I look back and enjoy each and every organized event I've been through. I was expecting the triathlon to be a lot like the mud races I had been doing, but there is a world of difference. The Mud Races are athletically inspired parties and the Triathlon is a more serious (yet still fun) self disciplined sport. This is evident in the difference in atmospheres with live bands, funny costumes and the prevalence of beer stands at the mud runs. None of which came anywhere close to the triathlon experience I had. All the same, the kinship felt with the fellow participants and excitement of the event was still quite enjoyable. I also feel there is a more serious commitment a triathlete makes in preparing for one. I'm obese and slow, yet due to the fact I have been actively training, I am passing a large amount of the field at the mud runs and and going through obstacles at a stronger pace and less winded then people half my weight who at least look like they should be more fit. It's evident to me that the vast majority of the people going to a mud race have no notion or concept of training to participate, but nearly everyone at the triathlon clearly has been taking the sport more serious and showing more dedication. This is even more evident in the race results. At the mud race, my slow/obese self posted a time better than 60% of the participants. Yet at the Sprint Triathlon this past weekend, I placed better than only 10% of the participants. I did not go slower in the triathlon and I was not slowed down by fatigue. In fact, my 5k run portion was only 1 second slower than my fastest 5k run to date.


So now, I come to my observations as a first time triathlete. Swimming in open water was great. I knew I was not going to be the fastest swimmer in the water, so I intentionally did not put myself at the front of the gate. I was frustrated a little bit being at the back of the back in that I was actually sloed down by people next to me. I am very comfortable in the water and swam in the open water a lot when I was a kid, so I'm practiced at swimming a straight line without having something to guide me I can look at while my head was under water. However, I was contending with people swerving left and right around me and while I would gain on someone, I found it near impossible to pass them without going quite a deal out of my way, so ultimately I just slowed to their pace and avoided letting them kick me in the face. 

In my haste and excitement in the first transition, I didn't take any time to dry my feet. This lead to prematurely overly wet socks which was annoying, but after having done mud runs, I was used to running in wet socks anyways. I take that as a note for the future to remember to take a couple of extra seconds to dry my feet before putting on the socks. The bike run started out well and I did enjoy not having to slow down or stop at stop signs due to the course being blocked off by police. I metered my water consumption throughout the biking leg and halfway through, I pulled out the energy gel I had packed away for this leg of the trip. Wow, this was something I wasn't prepared for. The energy gel I had was absolutely repulsive and I nearly threw up trying to get it down. I got it down anyways, but I have to find either a different brand or a different plan for refilling myself during the bike run. Other than that, the biking leg was fairly uneventful and went smoothly. 

I came into the second transition ready to run. I had done some bricks to practice transitioning from bike to run several times and haven't ever found it a difficult transition to make. I anticipate as I get stronger and can use my muscles to higher effectiveness, I might start experiencing the transition problems that a lot of people have, but it's not been a problem for me. My 2nd transition went very smooth and quick and I was off to my run/jog. Living in the south, it's fairly warm this time of year, so I was thankful that most of the running route was along tree shaded sidewalks. I did not stop to walk at any point across the race and water stations were well placed. Whereas on the bike I did not pass anyone and many people passed me, I was regularly passing people on the run. As I pulled around the final tenth of a mile I broke out into a full paced run and came across the finish line giving it all I had.

Now, I mention I'm slow/obese and that this was my first Sprint Triathlon. I recognize these numbers are extremely slow, but I'm proud first in that I finished and these numbers are my baseline for future improvement, so here's my results: Swim: 14:34 / T1: 1:48 / Bike: 43:06 / T2: 0:32 / Run: 33:01 / Total: 1:33:03 

Comparing myself to other people, it seems apparent to me that the biggest area I have for improvement is on the bike. This shouldn't be suprising because most of my training was in the water or on the run. I was ahead of about 13% of my age group getting out of the water, but I was second to last in my age group getting off the bike, and I recaptured lost ground on the run. Now as I look to the future, I have my eyes set on an Olympic triathlon later this year and I intend to focus on making a shift to getting more heavy on the bike training.

1334780173.0,23,self.triathlon,sgkrb,How to read a swim workout,25,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/sgkrb/how_to_read_a_swim_workout/,"So last week I posted about the [NTC Masters blog](http://www.ntcmastersswim.blogspot.com), which has a great collection of swim workouts. Redditor maximumgeek mentioned that he didn't bother with swim workouts because they all read like Greek to him. I thought, that's understandable, they are kinda in code. So I figured I would break down some common swim workout terminology and shorthand for the benefit of those who don't have a lot of experience with detailed swimming workouts. For the sake of simplicity, I will refer to everything in yards. 

_________________________________________________________

**Overview and Basics**

Pretty much all swim workouts consist of a warm-up, a series of timed interval sets (one of which will be your ""main"" set and will typically be the longest/hardest one), and a cool down. The interval sets will be written something like this:

A) 6x100 @ 2:00 **OR** B) 6x100 :20 rest

Both versions = swim 6 sets of 100 yards each; stop for rest after each 100, but not within the 100.

Version A assumes that you will complete your 100 yards in LESS THAN 2 minutes, and will use your remaining time to rest. You will then repeat this set 6 times, adding up to total of 600 yards in 12 minutes. 

Version B means that you will complete 100 yards, rest for 20 seconds, and then repeat. This type of interval timing is often good for beginners who may have a more difficult time maintaining the same speed over multiple sets.

Sets will generally tell you to swim, kick, pull, or drill. ""Swim"" always means freestyle, usually at a moderate pace. ""Kick"" (sometimes abbreviated as 'k') can be kicking on with a board or on your back . ""Pull"" (p) means using a pull buoy, placed between either your thighs or your ankles, no kicking. ""Drill"" (d) means do any of a variety of useful swimming drills; they typically emphasize one aspect of freestyle and are designed to improve your form. 

**Workout**

* 500 choice warm up
* 6x75 kick/drill/swim by 25 @1:45
* 4x200 swim descend 1-4 @3:40
* 300 pull 3/5/7 hypoxic by 25
* 4x100 build @ 2:00
* 6x75 free/non-free/free by 25 @1:30
* 8x25 IM order @:30
* 200 cool down

**Workout Breakdown**

500 choice warm up -- ""Choice"" just means whatever you want to do - swimming, kicking, pulling - that will get you warmed up.

6x75 kick/drill/swim by 25 @1:45 -- A set that says ""X/Y/Z by 25"" means do each for 25 yards; so for this set, kick 25, do a drill 25, and then swim 25. 

4x200 swim, descend 1-4 @3:40 -- ""Descend"" means that you should complete each successive distance in a faster time than the one before it. So for this set, the first 200 should be relatively easy/slow, the next one should be a bit faster, and the last one should be hard and very fast. Sometimes a long set will have you descend twice, i.e. 6x100 swim, descend 1-3, 4-6. This means that after you complete your 3rd 100 at a hard speed/effort, you can restart your 4th 100 at an easy pace. Sometimes abbreviated as ""desc.""

300 pull 3/5/7 hypoxic by 25 -- Hypoxic breathing is a great way to ~~build your lung capacity~~ make a set more intense, and is done by challenging your regular breathing pattern. For this set, you would swim 300 yards straight using a pull buoy. On the first 25, breathe every 3 strokes. On the 2nd 25, breathe every 5 strokes. On the 3rd 25, breathe every 7 strokes. Repeat until you complete 300 yards. 

4x100 build @2:00 -- ""Build"" means that within the distance, you should significantly increase your speed/effort. In this case, when you start your first 100, you should be going at an easy pace, and by the time you complete it, you should be going fast. The next 100 is the same: start easy, finish fast. This is NOT the same thing as descending!

6x75 free/non-free/free by 25 @1:30 -- ""Non-free"" is exactly what is sounds like - any stroke besides freestyle. Again, do each for 25 yards: swim freestyle 25, swim backstroke/breaststroke/butterfly 25, swim freestyle 25. May also be written as ""stroke"" instead of non-free. If you aren't comfortable with the different strokes, you can do anything that isn't regular freestyle, such as kicking or pulling. 

8x25 IM order @:30 -- ""IM"" stands for Individual Medley, and refers to the four swim strokes in order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle. For this set, your first 25 yards would be butterfly, the 2nd 25 backstroke, and so on. For the 5th 25, you would start over with butterfly again. If you aren't comfortable/familiar with the different strokes, you can just do freestyle and adjust the interval to make it more challenging. 

200 cool down -- Do whatever you feel like doing (slow freestyle/stroke, kicking) to feel adequately cooled down.

1350340811.0,25,self.triathlon,11jbt8,In Memory,25,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/11jbt8/in_memory/,"A friend passed away tragically this Saturday while riding her bicycle on the Pacific Coast Highway near Malibu.  She was training for Ironman Arizona next month, and this 80 miler was one of her long rides.

 

I’m not sure I’m qualified to call her a friend.  I only ran with her once up Echo Mountain, followed by lunch at Roscoe’s with a mutual friend where we had a silly time comparing our dating lives to the job search process.  I’d seen her a few times since, at dinners with triathlon friends, or while running at the Rose Bowl.

 

She was young.  Young enough to leave behind a grieving mother.  Too young to die.  Her passing served as an unwelcome reminder of our short time here on Earth.  Whether we’re here for 30 years or 90, we will all die someday.  If you or a loved one were to go tomorrow, would you be at peace?  Would there be any regrets?  Let’s not put off that thing you’ve been putting off any longer.  Apathy, Laziness, Pride, or Fear are only EXCUSES we use to convince ourselves that now is not the time.

 

The outpouring of shock and grief on my friend’s facebook page serve as testament to her grace and inspiration.  As a mentor for the Leukemia Society’s Team in Training program, she’s helped dozens of teammates realize their dreams of finishing their first triathlon or marathon.  I think her pursuit of her own athletic dreams was as powerful of a source of inspiration as the encouragement and advice that she generously passed on to her mentees, teammates, and friends.  Ironman Arizona was to be her first full distance triathlon.

It is the exact same race except we don't get to jump off the ferry and there is no elevator to take us down from the mountain. Since we were less than 160 competitors only the time cutoffs for black/white shirts were used.

I arrived the day prior to the race. A quick packing of different bags later I went to bed. At 04 AM the alarm went off, no registration meant we could sleep longer. Fourty five minutes later we park the car where the swim starts and descend the steep track down to the water. With only one kayak it was even more important that we all swam along the shore as close as possible. As the race manual says ""you cannot stand on your feet, because the fjord is 400 meters deep"". Today, it was cold as well. 13-14 C was measured.

The swim went ok. The water was absolutely still and I found some legs to draft on. Almost 90 minutes later I found myself in the most quiet T1 I've ever seen. No rushing or stress, just people talking to their support and changing. 

The bike leg was pretty brutal. The height profile can be seen [here](http://nxtri.com/race_info/course_and_map). Not much to do on the first ascent then find the lowest gear and take your time. I had divided the leg into four parts and found some ""pass no later than this, here"" times and places. Up Måbudalen and to the first peak I missed it with ten minutes, I think. The strong headwind would be my nemesis all day. From Dyranut to Geilo is the fast part of the course. The wind took care of that and gave me the toughest part of the whole day, this was the closest I came to crying all day. Work, work, work with little to show for it. In total I used my ""no slower than this"" time on this part of the course. The next part of the leg, in my head, was over the three next mountains and to the base of the last. Luckily I got what I expected. The trees took most of the wind and with my slow speed it was ok. The week leading up to the race I have created the course on bikeroutetoaster.com and loaded onto my Garmin Edge. This gave me the elevation for the next two kilometers and I hardly took my eyes of the screen. The summits came exactly when I knew they would and all was good. With the help from my excellent support I dumped all my warm clothes before each climb and got them back for the downhill sections. The first hill chilled my knees so much I took two plastic bags and put them over my knees under the pants. This stopped the wind effectively and saved my day. On the third of the five hills the rain came. Without glasses this added a fine touch to an already glorious day. Some misery later I was on top of Imingfjell covered in fog and was ready for downhill. At this time I had big winter gloves, arm warmers, normal jersey, thick jacket, wind jacked, neck warmer around neck and neck warmer used as a cap, topped with my girl friend's glasses. 

In T2 I met my family who chatted with me while I changed. My support gave a discreet ""maybe we should turn around so he can change"" to tell my unknowing family that changing here is in the parking lot without any tents. 

The first 25km of running is very uneventfull. At 19km you see the mountain for the first time and you are struck with awe from the size of it and what you are about to climb. Or so I've been told. Fog covered the whole damn thing. With my knees still hurting I made it to 25k and the final ascent. This is steep. ""Zombie Hill"" is 10km of 10% elevation grade, and very few people can run up. I couldn't and got a run/walk mix going. I had control on the cutoff time for the black tshirt so at this time it was a waiting game. I could walk up and get the shirt. The first cutoff is at 32 km and the next at 37km, right before leaving the road and taking the rocky path to the top. At 34km I met the leader who was coming back down and he told me the mountain top was closed due to fog. We were to run up to 37km and then run back to 32. This isn't the first time this happens so I was prepared for it. With the waiting game in my mind I knew I would have reached the summit given time. Once you pass Stavsro at 37km there is not cutoff. The average competitor uses 90 minutes on those last 5kms to the summit. With my pace it would be three more hours of walking/running to the top and back, just grinding it out. It was bitter, but also ok to not go to the top. I turned at 37km and ran down (down!) the last kilometers to the finish. 

Looking back I am not as tired as after my last Iron-distance. I had saved a lot of strenght for that last, rocky ascent. When it was cancelled I finished with more strength left in the legs than I should have. This is what bugs me the most. At this point I would like to thank my support team who made it possible.

Still, I did it. I got the tshirt. It was a long day, and it was worth it. Now I am back in Eidfjord preparing for the weekend's big happenings.

I only do one or two tris a year and am usually comically under prepared for the race.

I didn't own a road bike so I borrowed my brothers $100 CL special.  I've ridden it a few times so I am familiar enough with it.  I went to pick it up last night at about 8:30 and was just putting around in the parking lot to make sure everything was in working order.  I was shifting through all the gears and when I went to put it into the lowest gear i heard a pop and the bike skidded to the stop.  I inspected the damage and the rear derailleur had caught a spoke got pulled all the way around the frame.

Needless to say, it was a total loss.  So now I'm freaking out, I have about 12 hours before my race and no bike.  Called around, and obviously, no bike shops are open.  Finally, after exercising all my other options, i made a trip to the super mega walmart and bought a very sexy, $159.99 GMC Denali road bike.  

Did the bike portion with the tags still on it.  I didn't even get a chance to adjust the seat before the race.  Except for the horrible shifting, it actually road pretty nice.  Ended up cutting over 18 minutes off of last years time too.  Only 5 minutes came from the bike portion though.

Here are my 2 latest ones. The music may not match up 100% as I'm constantly tweaking the music. You may or may not like it, but well, that's your opinion. Feel free to substitute the music with something else. Also, I'm always taking music requests/suggestions.

Inside each of the documents is the Spotify playlists as well.

They are 2 hours, but you can stop any time. They are broken into sections of strength, intervals and endurance, so pick and choose.

- [Ride One](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/31807/SCT%20Spinning%20-%20Ride%20One.docx)
- [Ride Two](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/31807/SCT%20Spinning%20-%20Ride%20Two.docx)

If you don't have a heart rate monitor, here is a scale, given a lactic threshold (LT) of 85% of your max heart rate (MHR).

If you don't have a monitor, it's subjective. This would be my scale I use with my team mates.

- 90% is lactic acid has build up, 30-60 seconds, required immediate recovery after. (INSANE)
- 85% is lactic acid is slowly building up. You can last a few minutes. Recovery may not be necessary. (HELL)
- 80-85% is exhausting, no burning and you can hold it for 20 minutes. (HARD aka Race Pace)
- 78-80% feels hard, not super exhausting, a strong and good feeling, and can hold it for 60+ minutes. (MEDIUM)

Since I'm leading more classes this winter (every 2nd weekend I lead 2x2 hour classes), so I'll post them as I create them to keep you guys entertained as well.

Enjoy!

It was a dark and cloudy day as I showed up with a nervous air to my first open water tri. Dumping my stuff like an anxious shrew next to someone's expensive gear, I interrupted a group talking about their Ironman accomplishments to sheepishly ask for a washroom location. 

To save the details, I showed up 10 minutes before race start with a finally settled stomach, which is always my fear on race days. After a couple minutes of sweating, grunting, swearing, and generally looking like an idiot, I was standing in the water, clad in my super speedy wetsuit looking like I was straight outta the avengers. 

I'll preface this part by admitting that I haven't swam in 3 months (moved back home and don't want to pay $4.50 per time for the tiny pool here), but dear lord does a wetsuit make up for that. I should have listened to you all about how much difference a wetsuit makes, because dear sweet jesus I was flying like an angry pelican after a mate. 

Of course, by flying I was behind the others cause I'm a horrible swimmer, but I popped outta the water in 30 minutes with a grin on my face and my family cheering after showing up. 

Feeling great, I changed and hopped on the bike and just absolutely cranked it. The rain had started pounding by now, and the race consisted of legs A and B, done in A-B-A order (both were out and backs) so I was able to see how many were in front of me. By the finish of leg B, i'd placed myself firmly in 4th and was all out flying. I spent the last leg off the seat and pumping myself, bringing me to a tie for 3rd just as we hit T2. 

As the other cyclist slapped his teammate (whom I think was his young son, musta been around 10, the kid was a champ) I changed shoes, way too obsessed with gaining the lead to care about changing my soaked socks, and hit the road hard. 

Passed the kid not problem, and after a hill and some stairs, I hit a straight section where I had my sights on the 2 ahead of me. 

My legs were catching on, and at the 5 k turn around, the three of us were lined up in 5 second intervals, with me hungry. another kilometre down, and it was me and a jacked ironman (I could tell from his calf tattoo) just both gunning for the lead. 

And then I passed him. Just keeping on my pace I shot past him and kept pushing. All the other racers headed the other way cheered for me, having seen me catch the leader through the race and I flashed thumbs up and waves to them all. 

I kept opening up space over the next kilometre, until I realized the houses didn't look the same as the first time I'd passed by.

Fuck.

I'd missed the turn off.

I turned, and booked it. Fastest 3 km I'd ever ran, just flying down a set of stairs and careening around wet concrete corner, just to finish 10 seconds behind 2 people I'd already passed.

Thorougly disappointed in myself, but it was still a great race and I had a smile on the whole time despite the torrential downpour on the bike leg. Finished at 2:18 in 3rd place, with nothing but my own lack of attention keeping me from that 1st place finish.

I got in the pool with a friend of mine yesterday and we did some intervals for a bit. I stayed in the pool after he left because I wanted to keep going.

So I start out thinking, ""Alright, let's go for 200 really slow to cool down."" Well I felt great at 200, and so I went for 400.  Eventually I hit 1600.  I'm flabbergasted, and have no idea how it happened.  I just hit some kind of rhythm that felt fantastic.

[updated],28,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/zeh90/do_you_want_rtriathlon_gear_let_us_know_updated/,"I heard from 99 people who would be interested in purchasing /r/triathlon kit. See the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/z2lli/do_you_want_rtriathlon_gear_let_us_know/) for details about that.

I had a lot of suggestions about combining with /r/bicycling for their winter holiday order to get some tri gear in. I want to make sure that you'd all be okay with this, so [CLICK HERE](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SV3RWKV) for a short survey about buying a kit that matches (or doesn't) with /r/bicycling's order--and whatever their design ends up being.

First survey RESULTS SUMMARY:

* 64 people would purchase a tri-suit (median price, $95)
* 77 people would purchase a tri top/tank (median price, $60)
* 74 people would purchase tri shorts (median price, $60)
* Favorite ""preferred"" brand: 2XU (50 votes), then Pearl Izumi (44)
* Primal and Hincapie were the most ""would not purchased"" (10), followed by Sugoi (7), Louis Garneau (6), Pearl (3), and 2XU (0)
* Most suggested other brands: Zoot, TYR, DeSoto.

Based on the pricing curves, I think we'd be able to achieve the lowest price for products from most of the suppliers I looked into. The only exception would be if suppliers view women's products as separate 'styles,' but as far as I can tell, Sugoi and Hincapie definitely do not distinguish between men's and women's. (Garneau may differentiate; all other suppliers are unknown, as they require custom quotes.)

On that last point, I haven't looked into TYR or De Soto yet, but I could not find any indication that Zoot makes custom orders.

If it looks like we don't want to go with jumping onto /r/bicycling's order, then I'll pursue custom quotes from the other suppliers. If not, I'll work with /r/bicycling on how we can best get in on their purchase this winter.

When I first started running two years ago I couldn't go a full mile without having to stop and walk. So I could run for half a mile, walk 30 seconds, and repeat. I kept this up for several months, and could run up to 7 miles at a 10:00/mile pace by doing this. One day my wife came with me to run, and I stayed with her at a much slower pace (11:00/mile) for the start. She dropped off after 5 minutes, but I kept going at that pace. My runkeeper app notified me when I passed one mile, then two, then three. Before I knew it I had completed the entire 5 mile loop at Newport News park, all without having to stop. I had found the perfect groove to run in without exhausting myself too quickly.

Yesterday I had the same sort of breakthrough in swimming.

I forced myself to swim as slow as possible, really stretching my hand out forward on each stroke. I quickly fell into a good rhythm, and by the time I finished the first 100m I didn't feel tired at all. The second 100m was also easy, as was the third. It started getting a little more difficult after that, but still easy enough that when I reached 500m I kept going. I stopped briefly at 750m to get some water out of my goggles and to look at the clock: 15:17, a pace of 2:02/100m. In the final 250m my arms got noticeably more tired and my form started unraveling, but I finished the 1km in 22:11, a pace of 2:13/100m.

This sudden breakthrough is attributable to several changes I've made in the last week or so:

* Doing 75-freestyle, 25-breaststroke breaks each 100m into small goals to swim towards. It also makes it easier to count my distance, which lets me focus on breathing and form.
* Breathing every two strokes instead of every three.
* Forcing myself to maintain a slow pace. In the past as I got more and more out-of-breath I would speed up in order to breathe more often, which is obviously a vicious circle.
* Exhaling harder under the water to make sure I get most of the air out of my lungs.

The first three are ""training wheel"" type exercises, and I will eventually stop doing them, but for now they're really helping me on the long swims. I walked away from yesterday's swim feeling amazing. For the first time all summer I'm not dreading the swim leg.

1340641051.0,19,self.triathlon,vksmo,Finished my first Sprint race on Saturday,24,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/vksmo/finished_my_first_sprint_race_on_saturday/,"I will try to tell my whole story here, since I know people who are just getting started tend to search out stories of first-timers - and I hope that I can help motivate them - because, though it is said a lot, I really believe that if I can do it then anyone can.   I'll split it up into background and race story for people who don't care about my history and just want to hear about the race.

--------BACKGROUND STORY--------------

Back around November, I recognized that I needed a major change in my lifestyle.  Having always had weight struggles, and successfully losing 90 pounds about 9 years ago, the weight had been slowly creeping back on.  That slow creep had only accelerated since my son had been born about a year earlier and, at 6 foot 1 inches tall, I was back up to 228 pounds (dangerously close to 250, my all-time high).  At the same time, a few of the more athletic people from my office sent out an email to the company - they were planning on doing the Philadelphia Triathlon the following June and anyone who wanted to join them was encouraged to sign up.  We'd all be able to support each other with the knowledge that we were doing the same race.  Initially, I thought I could handle getting in shape for the bike and run, but the swim (a half-mile open water swim in a pretty major river) intimidated me.   One of those guys volunteered to do the swim for me and we signed up as a relay team - with him doing the swim and me doing the bike and run.  Then I began training.  

Quickly, I began to realize that swimming was actually a strength for me, not a weakness.  I changed my registration to an individual competitor and focused on a training plan (BeginnerTriathlete's 16 week, 2x Sprint plan).  The stories of my training are scattered in the comments of the ""Tell us how your training went this week"" posts from earlier this year, so I won't recount those.  The incredibly mild winter we had this year allowed me to train outside all winter long, which was incredibly useful.  By the end of March/early April, I was feeling really confident about my fitness and ability to do the race.  

But of course, there's a twist - starting in April, work got INSANELY busy.  By early May I was working 11-12 hour days - combine that with having a young child and it just did not leave much time for training.  My workouts basically were non-existent over the 2 months leading up to the race and I had no idea how quickly my newly found endurance would disintegrate.  

------------- THE RACE ---------------

Friday afternoon I went to the race site to pick up my packet.  After that, I decided to walk down to the transition area and check it out - having never even seen a transition area before.  I found where I was to rack my bike - saw the signs for the swim start/finish, bike in and out etc.  Then I walked back up to my car and realized that I was drenched in sweat.  Admittedly, it was in the 90's and pretty humid on Friday - but that didn't do lots for my confidence, if 20-30 minutes of walking around got me that sweaty.  Then it rained Friday night - which helped kill the heat and humidity, but now I was concerned that the swim might be cancelled and replaced with a run - and I did NOT think I could do 2 runs - swimming was my strength.  I ate some plain pasta for dinner, drank some Gatorade to pre-hydrate and went to bed at about 9 PM - shockingly I was able to get to sleep.

Saturday I was up at 4:45 - took a quick shower, went over my race-bag checklist, pumped up my tire pressure and hit the road.  Shortly after parking at the race, I bumped into some of my other coworkers (other first-timers who had signed up) and immediately relaxed.  We were all in it together, now.  I set up my transition area, and we all lined up to wait for our swim wave.  I was in the 6th starting wave - a full 30 minutes of standing around hearing the horn start off other age groups before I got to go.  


----The Swim-----  
By the time came for my age group to get into the water for our in-water start I was EXCITED and rearing to go.  My plan for the swim was to stick to the back - I was doing breaststroke (my strongest stroke and much easier to do sighting with my head bobbing out of the water on every stroke) and I didn't really want people behind me to kick in the head.  I even followed a friend's advice to just sit in the water and count to 10 after the horn blew to get a little space around me.  I was expecting the swim to be a madhouse of bodies in the water but it really wasn't.  As I started going I found that I was passing a good number of people in my age groups (we wore colored swim caps to identify our age groups so it was really easy to spot in the water).  By the end of the swim, I was actually starting to pass the slower people of the PREVIOUS age group to go (and to get passed by the faster people of the age group that followed me - but what can you do).  I was thrilled to see the swim exit but I was NOT expecting my legs to be as wobbly as they were coming out of the water.  I don't know if I pushed myself harder than I did in my training (in my training swims I usually did DOUBLE the race distance), or if it was getting out of the water onto sand instead of solid ground but I definitely was in no shape to be running into transition as I saw so many others doing ahead of me.  

-----T1------   
I took a leisurely stroll into the transition area to where my bike was racked, grabbed my towel and sat down on the ground.  I took a few swigs of Gatorade from my bike bottle, I found some energy chews, scarfed them down and attempted to wipe down my feet, pull on socks and get my biking shoes on - all the while trying to regain my breath and feeling of leg-stability.  I got up, unracked my bike and began walking (still was not ready to be running out of transition) to the mount line - nervous about how tired I already was.

[NTC Masters Swim](http://www.ntcmastersswim.blogspot.com/)

It's a blog that consists purely of weekly swim workouts from the National Training Center in Florida. Workouts are posted 2-3 times a week, and past workouts are archived all the way back to 2008. At least half the time, variations of the workout are listed by length, from 2000-4000 meters, so you can pick the one that fits your needs, skill level, and time constraints. It also has sections that define terms which might be unfamiliar to beginners, and where specific drills are explained. 

I've been swimming for more than 15 years, for high school, for club, and a little for college. When I got into triathlon a couple years ago I had a hard time finding places to get satisfactory swim workouts, that matched the quality I had come to expect from years of being coached. Most of the ones I found were too short, really vague, or just plain boring. This site is excellent! If I don't like the WOD I can go back a couple years and find one that suits me. Been using it for a couple months and haven't been disappointed yet! :)

And just in case you're wondering, I don't work for the National Training Center and I am not involved with this blog. Just want to help people get in some good swim workouts!  ^_^",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,True,,,True,t3_s7ztz,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/s7ztz/awesome_site_for_swim_workouts/,

I've been there a few times, and my dad is in Manila for the most part of a year, so he suggested I come out and do it there.

Well after being on the waitlist for a long time, I got in.

Now, I just have to figure out... how the heck to I exactly make sure I can survive?

I've decided to dedicate my race to an NPO, and use it as an opportunity to raise money for a good cause. So, it is important to me that I do my best these next few months to prepare for the race, because I want to do it for reasons other than self-accomplishment.

I have day-by-day training plans out for the following 3 months always, but last night I came up with a tentative plan to get to Ironman by 2015.  Just wondering if these seem like reasonable landmarks, or if there is anything I should be adding/changing:

**Spring-Summer 2013:**  
• First Olympic distance finish (DONE)  
• Complete 70.3 distance for all three disciplines  
       o 1.2 Open water swim (DONE)  
       o 56 mile bike  (scheduled: end of aug)  
       o 13.1 mile run (DONE)  
• Improve sprint distance race (scheduled: aug 17)  

**Fall 2013-Winter 2014**  
• First marathon finish  
• Maintain fitness  
• Volunteer IM (Sept)  

**Spring-Summer 2014**  
• First 70.3 finish   
• Improve Olympic distance race  
• Upgrade equipment  

**Fall 2014-Winter 2015**  
• Volunteer IM: REGISTER FOR IRONMAN  
• Achieve total comfort in swim distance (2.4) by late winter  
• Train for ironman

**Spring-Summer 2015**  
• Train for ironman  
• Achieve bike distance (112) by summer  
• Complete practice races (early 70.3 or mid-summer Olympic)  

**Fall 2015**  
• Ironman Wisconsin  

*Background*: I'm a former competitive swimmer of 17 years (inc. NCAA).  I took 2 years off after swimming, so I'm doing a little bit of getting back in shape, but it's coming back fast.  I started running exactly one year ago, my first run being just one painful mile then.  I've always been a strong biker in the sense that I can put miles and mile in without major fatigue issues......I need to work on speed though (esp. on hills).  I'm not all that fast.

I realize now there are lots of things to consider when replacing, maintaining your swim/bike/run gear, so I wanted to create an official thread to catalog it all. I will try to create comment threads for each piece of gear to make it easier to find information and contribute, and I will update the main post with information that is posted below.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the input! Keep adding to this and upvoting comments you know to be true so I get the best indication of valuable advice.

**Wetsuit** - always rinse your wetsuit after a swim (I use my bathtub), then hang dry. However, do NOT leave it hanging for prolonged periods as it will stretch the fabric ([comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/14mk3l/official_gear_maintenance_post/c7eifnj)).


**Bike Chain** - keeping the chain lubed increases the life of your chain ([comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/14mk3l/official_gear_maintenance_post/c7er3gu)), but it is recommended you get a ""chain wear indicator"" (something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_14?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=bike+chain+wear+indicator&amp;sprefix=bike+chain+wea%2Caps%2C309), [comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/14mk3l/official_gear_maintenance_post/c7er6nm)) and periodically check the chain and replace it after it's stretched beyond a certain point.

**Bike Tire 1** - If you only replace one tire, make sure the newest tire is moved to the front ([comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/14mk3l/official_gear_maintenance_post/c7eihld)).

**Bike Tire 2** - many bike tires have wear indicators (coloured rubber that will show through when the tread wears down), replace once you start seeing these [comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/14mk3l/official_gear_maintenance_post/c7eh4qw).

**Bike Clothing** - Dress slowly when putting on tights. Don't pull at the seams. Be really careful putting on overshoes. Repair tear as soon as you can. Buy some thermal shorts and use leg/knee warmers in the winter. Tights are expensive and when you slip on the inevitable ice, they are more costly to replace than knee warmers [comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/14mk3l/official_gear_maintenance_post/c7er4i9).

**Minimalist Running Shoes** - Most minimalist shoes have wear indicators on the bottom [comment thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/14mk3l/official_gear_maintenance_post/c7elq4u).

**Running Shoe cleanliness** - If you accidentally mud-up your runners, remove the laces and bedding and throw them in the washer!

Age Group Rank = 13/31

Pre-race routine:

Went to bed at 8PM Friday night and then woke up at 4AM Saturday morning. Transition opens at 5:30 and I wanted to be there right at the beginning. I ate a couple of bananas and had some orange juice for breakfast. I applied my first coat of sunblock before leaving the house. Quick drive to the course and got lucky on parking as I was early and got a little lucky finding some on the side of the street. Not too much trouble setting up my T1. However, I couldn't find my mother before my wave start and I spent a while running around the beach trying to hand off my excess gear. Never ended up finding here before the race. More on this later

Event warmup:

I didn't have much time to warm up (excluding running around the beach) since I was almost late for my wave (1st) start. I got in the water with about 2 minutes to spare and barely had enough time to setup my 910 and get my goggles adjusted.


SWIM
1h 15m 17s 4224 yards 01m 47s / 100 yards

Comments:

My goal time for the swim was 1:20-1:30 based upon my swim time at HITS Napa. Overall I was very happy with my swim considering it is my weakest discipline. At the start of the swim I was having serious problems with my goggles not being set properly. I had to flip over on my back a couple times in the first 250 meters to adjust my goggles. Once I got this set everything went flawlessly. Most of the course I was breathing to my left side every other stroke. Since you have to keep the buoys on your left all the time this worked well. During the shallow sections at the top of the course I found that the walking was actually slower than the swimming. I found that what worked best for me was grabbing at the river bed with my hands and effectively walking on my hands down this stretch. YMMV as this will depend on your arm length and the water level at the day of the race.
What would you do differently?:

Get in the water sooner than 2 minutes before my wave. This would give me a bit of time for warm up and setting my goggles. Overall very happy with this swim.

TRANSITION 1
06m 24s

Comments:

I still had a bunch of excess gear in T1 because I didn't manage to hand off to my mother before the start. Luckily I managed to spot her coming out of the water and I let her know what was going on. I had to run from my bike back to the fence where the spectators were in order to hand off a big gym bag of gear so I lost a little time here. No major problems in T1 but I just need more practice. I used some cooking spray on my ankles and it worked great. My wetsuit came right off and didn't get stuck at all. By the time I was exiting the ground was already quite muddy and I know I lost some time making sure to get my feet clean before I put on my socks and getting them into my shoes before they got dirty. I have no issue giving up a couple seconds in T1 to make my bike more comfortable. 

What would you do differently?:

Make sure to get get T1 properly prepped so that I don't have to run back and forth with gear. Also with all the mud I might have opted for a larger towel in order to help keep my feet from getting dirty before I got my shoes on. I still need a bunch of practice on my T1.


BIKE
6h 05m 20s  112 miles  18.41 mile/hr

Comments:

I was aiming for 6:00:00 on the bike so I got pretty close to that and I am overall happy with the bike. Based on my FTP I was targeting 170-175 Watts for the bike segment. I started out at ~190 and I had to spend the first 1/4 of the race calming myself down. Also my power was more erratic that I would have preferred. While my normalized power was 166W my average was 149W. Ideally I'd like to see those be a bit closer than that. I managed to hold myself back on the hills which was a good thing. I stayed in my saddle the entire time and spun up the hills. My cadence went a little lower than I would have liked on some of the hills up to and including chalk hill. I guess I just need to get stronger as I was already riding on a 11-28 with a compact. The sun started coming out on the second loop and I got a bit burned between my trisuit and my cool wings. It didn't bother me at all during the race but it was frustrating in the days after. For nutrition I had two bottles of highly concentrated malto. I started with one on the bike and I picked up the other at special needs. This worked very well for my needs. I should have been drinking more water though from my aero bottle through the day. Although I didn't have any problems with dehydration I could have ended up in a bad place if it had been hotter.

What would you do differently?:

Go out slower than you think necessary and ramp it up later in the course. Also I was riding on my Cervelo R3 with clip ons as it was the only bike I had at the time. I now have a tri bike for my next tri and I've had a proper fit done on it. With a properly fit tri bike I should be able to stay in an more aero position for longer and improve my speed without any additional power. Also should make sure to put some sunblock in special needs so that I can reapply part way through the day.

TRANSITION 2
05m 46s

Comments:

My time isn't too bad here considering how large T2 was. There was a long run in between the dismount line and the racks. Same applies with the racks to the run start. I didn't have any issues with transitioning here.

What would you do differently?:

With more practice I can definitely knock a minute or so off here. In general though I'm happy with it. 


RUN
4h 53m 12s  26.2 miles  11m 13s  min/mile

Comments:

Just like the bike I started off faster than I would have liked. However, on the run I managed to get it under control much sooner. The course was hillier than I expected but having just run the SF marathon I didn't have too much trouble with it. My one rule for the run was no walking which I succeeded with despite the tough hills. Although I brought along a bunch of gus with me on the run course I really didn't utilize them. Instead I was feeding primarily off the aide stations with the addition of my electrolyte pills which I brought with me. I stayed with just water at the aide stations plus gatorade every other aide station for the first lap. On the return segment of lap 2 I started adding in the coke which helped but didn't give me as much boost as I would have liked. For the final lap it was pretty much whatever I could manage. It was mostly coke, and water. I tried to take the coke first followed by the water to leave my mouth tasting fresher which seemed to work pretty well. I also heavily utilized the ice at the aide stations. Both tossing it in my hat and sucking on it between aide stations helped to keep me cool.

What would you do differently?:

I was aiming for 4:30 on the marathon. Although I was a decent way off from this I was still very happy with my performance on the run. I definitely have some time I can take off here though if I was pushing myself. I found the run to be easier than I expected. If it wasn't for my garmin I wouldn't have thought that I had run a full marathon. I found that my mind was so far gone that I wasn't counting off the miles like I would in a normal marathon which made it mentally a lot easier. Next time I am going to work on pushing the pace on the later stages of the run so I can properly negative split the marathon.


POST RACE

Warm down:

Not much off a cooldown here. I walked over to the athlete feed area and ate whatever I could get down(not much). I would see a delicious looking cookie and start eating it. Then two bites in my stomach would no longer be interested in eating it. 

What limited your ability to perform faster:

As my first iron distance race this was a big learning experience for me. I am surprised I managed to get so close to my goal times considering it was my first iron distance. I think what I need to work on the most beyond general fitness is refining my pacing. I should have been negative splitting both the bike and run. Also with one IM under my belt now I should be able to set better paces at the start of the bike and the run. We will see how this works out at IMLT.

For example, olympic gold-medalist Alistair Brownlee spent 17:04 in the water, 59:08 on the bike, and ran the 10k in 29:07. I think we can assume he does all about equally well. Why should the swimming leg be so much shorter than the others; and for that matter why is the bike almost twice as long as the run?

The tri I have my eyes set on is a pretty classic sprint - 500m swim, 10 mile bike, 5k run. This seems a little more balanced than some other sprints I've seen. Has anyone ever seen a triathlon that emphasized the swimming comparatively more? I noticed the local indoor tri has 15 mins of each, so I'm interested to try that (can't this year though).

The early morning lightning caused the event organizer to nix the swim portion, but still go to get on the bike and run a little bit. :)

I took away three things from this experience (training and competing...sort of):

1) I love having an external goal to guide and shape my internal goals of health and weight loss.

I went from weighing in at 315 lbs and being unable to run longer than a few minutes in January to weighing in at 279 lbs and finishing the bike and run portions of a Sprint tri (I'm pretty sure I could have done the swim too!).

2) The people involved with the sport are totally kick ass and I had a great time yesterday bs-ing with folks and cheering on/being cheered on by all the other competitors.

3) I need to train to ride more hills! 1346 ft of ascent over the course nearly took my legs right off.

It was a great experience and I'm looking forward to my next race. I haven't decided whether I should find another sprint nearby (time wise) or go for something towards the end of summer and ramp up for an OLY distance.

The big number on there was the swim split.  With an average of over 49 minutes it was the longest time of all the HIMs compared on this cart.  And the same almost goes for the run.

Is there anyone with experience with this race that knows what makes it so tough?  I'm hoping I'm in front of it enough to alter my training a bit for whatever the biggest challenges are going to be.

Not exactly.  I am obviously not a Lance fan but as a fan of the truth I feel it is important to get the full story out there - 

The UCI is the one that does the actual stripping of the titles, not USADA.  In the case of his bronze at the Olympics, that is determined by the IOC.  
As UCI/IOC is a signatory to the WADA code they are obligated to follow USADA's recommendation but currently they are waiting for documents from USADA before a final decision.  It is largely a procedural and paper work matter at this point but there is still the possibility of the UCI breaking their own rules and not following through with USADA's decision.

I did a search, but didn't find anything (my search-FU may be off today, Also, the FAQ is 100% blank?).

I am a runner looking to get into tri. I picked up a bike about 2 months ago, but haven't been able to ride much yet, mostly due to weather. Things are looking up on that front and I'm getting out a bit more and I had some questions.

When I go to a running race, I typically target the 1/2 marathon distance. I'm not super fast, but lately have been averaging just under 5:00/km pace. When I go out for a run, whether it's training or race day, I know exactly what I need for hydration, food, energy (gals, whatever), etc. 

When I go out on the bike, I'm not sure:

- how to prepare.
- hydration.
- gels.
- distances and speeds I should be targeting.


Any advice? I did 45km the other day with some friends who have been biking for a few years, and absolutely died on the last 10km or so. I went out this morning and did 18km no problem and felt I was pushing my speed a good bit (I haven't downloaded the data from my Garmin yet).

1370798995.0,15,self.triathlon,1fznm8,Race Report: My first sprint!,17,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1fznm8/race_report_my_first_sprint/,"**Event:** Maasdijk Sprint Triathlon, Lithoijen, The Netherlands

**Distances:** 500m, 22km, 5km

**Swim Gear**: Sailfish Attack Wetsuit, Zoggs Predator Flex Polarized goggles

**Bike Gear**: Wilier 705 XC 2012 MTB with Schwalbe Big Apple tires and a pair of 9 dollar platform pedals

**Race Report**: 
120 people at the start line ready for action. Most of them in wetsuits, although some courageous/foolish souls had decided to venture out into the 17 degree (celsius) water in nothing but a pair of boardshorts. The horn went off and the mass started moving into the water. I was in the middle of the pack, expecting to swim more or less the average time of 10:00 for the 500m. As soon as I hit the water my head went blank and I started rocketing away from the beach.

The first 100-150m of the swim was crowded, and I was constantly spotting to find hole in the crowd ahead of me. My original concept of breathing on both sides and sighting every 6 strokes quickly went out the window as the wind was blowing waves directly in our face. I sprinted out to the first buoy, and after I turned it found a quiet line that allowed me to benefit from swimming downstream for the next 200m. I shot past groups of people, turned the second and final buoy and started making my way back to the beach. I added some extra kick to wake my legs up and made it to the beach.

I ran out of the water and almost collapsed. I was completely disoriented. I somehow ran to my spot in the transition area and started what would become the slowest triathlon transition of all time. The cord on the wetsuit zipper was stuck behind the zipper itself, so no matter how much I flailed my arms I couldn't grab hold of it. I had to ask the person next to me to give it a quick pull, so I could start stripping off the wetsuit. I had a really hard time balancing, but managed to get my feet out.

I grabbed my towel, dried my feet off a little and pulled on my socks. Halfway through the first sock I fell over and decided it might be best to do the rest of the transition sitting down.

In the end, it took me over 3 minutes to get on the bike and out of the transition area.

The bikeride was tough. Because this was a triathlon that doesn't circle around the same transition area, but rather finishes 28km up the road, wind becomes a big factor. It was blowing pretty hard, directly in our face, and we were riding on dikes, so were above the protection of the bushes on either side of the road.

People were passing me left and right. Most of them were on beautiful time trial bikes, although a few regular road bikes flew by me as well. The rest of the ride was fairly uneventful, although the people along the sidelines were amazing, cheering us on all the way. My original plan was to get through the 22km in 45 minutes, but I quickly realized this wasn't happening. It was all about damage control, so I stuck to a gear I could maintain without too much lactic acid buildup, which puts me around a 50:00 ride for 22k.

My legt felt like jelly when I got to T2, hung up the bike, got rid of the helmet, and started the run. It took about 500m before my calves and hamstrings were on the edge of cramping up. I kept on going, as I had experienced this before and knew it would take a while before my legs were in run mode. I was with a large pack of runners, all running at the same pace. Occasionally chatting a bit, we dragged our sorry butts to the finish line. The last kilometer my legs actually felt great, and I was able to speed up significantly.

I crossed the finish line in 1 hour 26 minutes flat, 4 minutes faster than my goal time for the day. My first experience with triathlon was amazing. It was a crazy rush from start to finish, and pointed out a lot of things I can be working on.

Thanks to my brother for coming along for moral support and advanced photography! Thanks to the organization for a perfectly executed event, and thanks to all the other triathletes for being great every step of the way!

I have run a marathon (~4.5 hours LI marathon 2012), but other than that I have no race experience. So after some lurking and a little Google I decided on the swim focused Olympic 16 week plan from beginnertriathalete.com, I'm on week three with no problems so far and have a local race in mind that is scheduled in September. 

So the questions:
On workout days that I have two different exercises is it best to do them separately (one in the morning one in the afternoon) or one right after the other? I work 9-5 in a lab M-F and spend 16 hours sailing on the weekends so time and sleep is limited.

I'm not very fast, what is the best way to build my speed up in each discipline? My swim pace is 2min/100yd, my run pace is 9:30min/mi, and my bike is 14mph-16mph.

I ride a 1970 Raliegh road bike that must weigh a metric ton... is it possible to train on an old bike and rent a new one for race day or should I just buy a decent used bike (budget $300)?

Should I build in any weightlifting/strength training and if I do what are the best days to do this? 

Well those are a few questions, I'm out of my element here and really could use any advice.",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_1dvp58,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1dvp58/new_to_triathlon_trainingsome_questions/,

Together with a friend, I'm working on an idea for a website for endurance athletes. Website is still not ready for prime time, but we developed a demo video to get feedback about the idea and see what athletes think. 

I'd appreciate it if you would take 2 minutes to check it out and let us know what you think. Feel free to criticize the video (done by yours truly for $13 bucks!) and the website idea. 

I'm especially interested in hearing from coaches, club and race directors as we believe they would really benefit from our ""discovery engine"".

I always thought he brought too much baggage with him to be any kind of positive element for triathlon in a sport which to be honest already has enough characters in it.. Macca, Faris, Crowie etc. now I just think it would cast a shadow over the sport (although I understand he's free to race in whatever he wants.. oh, besides the WTC for the time-being at least).

Digressing a little, as far as I'm concerned I feel this way because he hasn't ""come clean"", admitted he did wrong, so he can't start that long road up redemption avenue like other cyclists Millar etc. have. I feel like he's still clutching onto the remaining diehard fans and cancer supporters that knew/loved him before this all finally blew up.

1349125039.0,16,self.triathlon,10s3bx,"My first 70.3, the Ironman 70.3 Pocono Mountains!",16,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/10s3bx/my_first_703_the_ironman_703_pocono_mountains/,"First timer for a 70.3 this one in the Poconos, so here it goes. (warning, fairly long wall of text)


Here we go!!  Saturday I was up fairly early leaving early on my way to the poconos for my first 70.3!  Got my race packet, nervous as anything, checked my timing chip, got body marked, and checked out the merchandise I was GOING to buy after I finished the race but they sold out!!  Once that was done it was off to T1 to drop off my bike and check out the lake!  My first impression of the lake was it was a little choppy but it was also fairly windy when we were there racking the bikes.  Just adding to my nervousness at this point, I swam a mile in an Olympic 2 weeks ago, but this easily looked twice as far.  Once that was situated it was off to T1 for our run bag drop off.  I put my Brian Dawkins jersey in the bag just in case I was feeling strong and wanted to run part of it in support of the Eagles retiring #20 that night against the Giants.


Once my transitions were set it was time to get the rest of my life situated for the race.  My girlfriend and I dropped off my friend, who was racing in Clydesdale, at his hotel while he did some grad school work and waited for his girlfriend to get off of work and drive up.  After we dropped him off he went off and scouted a few places for my family/friends to come spectate along the bike and run courses, though not an easy task.  Found a few good places, went to the hotel, checked in, and sent out an email with the directions and locations and estimated times for people to join in the spectating of the 6(+) hour event!  By the time that was done my girlfriends parents had made it up here, we went out for dinner around 6:30 and I was back to the hotel and in bed around 8:30.  Set my alarm for 4:10am and TRIED to fall asleep.


Well, needless to say, I was wide awake before my alarm even went off at 4:10.  Since I had gotten my stuff together last night all I had to do this morning was eat and get my wetsuit off the hanger to bring to the shuttle.  My girlfriend drove me over to the shuttle bus location around 5:10 where I met up with my other friend.  It was at least a 30 minutes shuttle from the middle school to T1 but hey, we made it with what I thought was going to be plenty of time.  Well once we got there, this is where things really started!  Like everyone else at the race, I had to use the bathroom.  The line was forever long but, no different than any other race, though this took at least a half hour.  Got my (sleeveless) wetsuit on, dropped off my morning clothes bag at the bus, and started to get cold while waiting for my wave to start, second white cap age groupers 26-29.  Finally, it was our turn to get into the water.  Ahh, finally time to warm up a little.  The water was 64.3, but that was about 15F warmer than the air we’ve been standing in for the last hour.  Anyway, my swim was pretty good for me.  I couldn’t see the other side of the lake when we started do to the fog from the lake being warmer than the air; my goggles fogged and swallowed water a few times.  Overall it was a 38:38.


Time for T1 and the bike.  I know my T1 times are always slow so I wasn’t concerned too much.  It was a 7:05 to take my wetsuit off, pack everything up, get ready for the bike and head out on what I knew was going to be a fairly hilly ride.  It was really really hilly.  The first 4 miles or so were really nice downhill, easily 30mph and may I add, FREEZING!!!!! Being soaking wet, riding 30mph, and it being 52F out...equals cold!  From there the first 20 miles were fairly flat, though a little wind.  My first 13.7 miles, average speed was 19.7mph, not bad, felt good.  From there it was a bit rough.  Though, I will say the scenery was amazing!  Riding down along the river, even with the hills, there were some great natural sites.  I almost wanted to stop a few times and take some pictures.  There were also some not so great roads that we were riding on, some holes, a SINK HOLE, bumps, road kill, among other things.  Split 2, where all the hills were, some TERRIBLE hills (to me) my average went down to 16.6, so the average over the whole race was 17.23mph.  For me that isn’t bad but right around my estimated 3:10 with 3:15:00.


Transition 2, boy was I out of it.  Quads were feeling ok, and overall I was tired but ready!  T2 was faster, 2:52, but this was without changing my shorts.  I normally wear underarmor shorts under my bike shorts then running shorts when I change in the transition but I was so out of it yesterday that I didn’t.  WHOOPS haha. I ran a half marathon in bike shorts, not the end of the world.  I also didn't put on my #20 Brian Dawkins Jersey, it was too hot.  Overall I did 2:16:34 for the run, which for me isn’t terrible.  My fastest half was 2:01, and even 1 year ago, at the Rock N’ Roll half I did 2:23 so I was even faster yesterday. Felt good, felt strong, only walked a little of a hill or 2.  As I was coming around the corner to run the last like .2 miles or so, I nearly started crying.  This was by far the most emotional race I’ve ever had.  I’ve done 4 half marathons, a couple tris, and I have never felt such a sense of accomplishment.  We’ll see what happens if I ever go for a full IM.
Today, Monday, I am actually feeling OK, just a little tired.  As for doing another one, I probably will, somewhere else, but we will see.  I hope everyone had a great race and a great time.  Definitely something completely different than just a half marathon or even sprint or Olympic distance tris.  Time to get training for my first full Marathon in November (in a week or so)…my next big challenge!


**TL;DR:** My overall time was 6:20:09, swim was 38:38, bike was 3:15 flat, and run was 2:16:34.  It was cold until about half way through the bike, for me.  Ohh and it was pouring as I crossed the finish line.  Great Hilly Race!

I'm fairly new to Reddit and have been slowly finding subs that are interesting to me. I thought last night to check and see if there was a triathlon subreddit and of course, I wasn't let down.

Some brief background on myself...in April of 2010 I was rear-ended by a drunk driver. The injuries were minor but enough that I had to go to a physical therapist for back problems. I also fell into a pretty severe depression and my weight ballooned. In August of 2010, at 373 lbs, I decided I needed to change my life. I started eating better and walking, which led to jogging, then running. In November 2010, I did my first ever 5K, which led to my first half-marathon in May 2011, and through some connections and a lot of naivete, I started training for a half-iron distance tri in June 2011.

I did the Oklahoma City RedMan Triathlon in September 2011, and the link is the story of that day. I am far from the fastest or best athlete out there, but I found this crazy love for pushing myself and my body to do things I never thought possible and since I've found great people and support not only on Reddit but in the tri community as a whole, I thought you might be interested.

Thought you guys might be interested in how the race went down and it would give the newer members an idea of what kind of pace to expect per event across a large field.


* [Swim Times](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai5_OiGSXcLTdHFiLXlrN2lSdVZkN0ZKLTBBam8wNmc#gid=9)
Note: there is roughly a 2 minute run before your swim time gets calculated, so it inflates the numbers a bit.

Note: there were way fewer women in the race, so the women participant data is scaled up so you can compare the distribution better.

The whole spreadsheet is shared, though it's missing the womens' data from the first tab.

I promised a race report in the weekly achievement thread and I shall deliver.

This was my first Full Ironman. I did my first half last October. My goal, going into it, was to just have fun. I did some simple calculations based on some previous races and figured I would finish somewhere between 15 and 16 hours. 

If you have never done a IM before there are a few things you should know. The days leading up to race day are full with anxiety and excited anticipation. I was worried about my nutrition. I only did my first triathlon last September, would I be ready? I felt silly asking a volunteer why there were no Wave start times posted (IM races donn't have waves, everyone starts at the same time). When I setup my bike, I noticed that I was probably one of the few people with just a road bike, not a fancy triathlon bike with zipp wheels. I soaked in all the excitement that was in the air. 

The night before the race I sent a few hours playing some boardgames. It still didn't hit me what I was doing the next day. I went to bed around 10pm and woke up around 4am. I got to the transition at 4:30 and got my water bottles set up and made sure my transition bags were all set. I had been abstaining from coffee for 2 weeks and desperately needed the caffeine. I got some Starbucks and then walked to the swim start. 

I got into the water about 10 minutes before the start and ended up hanging on to a boat instead of treading water. When the race started it was a mad house. Even though I positioned myself in the back I was still getting hit by everyone who was wearing a wetsuit (wetsuits people started later with a 10 minute penalty). The swim was long, longer that I was expecting. I really was hoping to finish around 1:20ish but at a little past the halfway point I got the worst charlie horse you could imagine. I floated on my back for a couple of minutes holding my leg up. It was extremely painful and didn't know what to do. I was scared that the rest of my day would be ruined. Thankfully, it went away and I was able to finish the swim with a 1:40ish time. As I got out of the water I was stumbling and had trouble making it up to the transition. I was already sunburned on my shoulders and and the area between my tri top and shorts (my lovehandles).


I got my bag and went to the tent to get ready for the long bike ride. One thing I remember was that the inside of the tent was like a sauna. Imagine 200+ guys sweating their asses off inside a giant circus tent. I really wanted to get out of there. I got on my bike and headed out of town into the country. The first 10-15miles were suburban outskirts. There was a nice tailwind pushing us into a state park in Huntsville. My nutrition plan was to drink a water bottle at each aid station and fill up my aero bottle with a energy drink at every water stop. In addition, I took 300mg of salt with a gu every half hour. The bike was actually shady for about 30% while we were in the state park and that was really nice and enjoyable. Around mile 80 I heard a large hissing noise looked back to see my rear tire acquired a flat. Another racer shouted ""Sorry bro"" I didn't even care though ""No worries man."" I yelled back. I was enjoying myself so much that I didn't even care. Plus it gave me a quick rest. About a minute after I pulled over one of the race crew came by and took care of everything for me, which was good because I couldn't have changed the tire as fast as this nice gentleman could have. I thanked him and was on my way.


My charlie horse from earlier in the day hadn't been bothering me at all. It must have been a miracle. I told myself to start stretching my calves as I came to the end of my ride at 3:30. The volunteers tool my bike and gave me my run transition bag. I decided to change into some compression shorts, running shorts an a shirt for the run. This ended up being a great idea because the shirt covered my already hurting sunburns and the compression shorts kept me from chaffing. I lubed up and left for the run and forgot to put a hat on in the process. 


With the charlie horse from the swim still on my mind, I told myself i would walk for a bit as to not agitate it. I walked briskly but it looked like I had a limp where my cramp was. Towards the end of the first lap I decided to run and to my surprise, running actually made the pain go away. Seriously, when I was running, all the cramps in my leg just disappeared. I looked at my watch and timed a mile. I could finish close to 15 hours at this pace, well within my goal! I as stoked. Each lap ended near the finish line where all the crowds were hanging out. There was so much excitement and energy in the air every time I came back around to that area. Towards the end of Lap 2, someone from the side shouted ""All this shit is worth it when you get to the finish line, I tell you."" There was something so sincere and candid about the way he said it. I started my last lap just as the sun was setting. During the water stops they were handing out chicken broth, which I gladly gulped down. Other than a prolonged hiccups attack at the end, the last lap was really uneventful (and even faster than my previous lap). I ended up passing a lot of runners that were on a death march, while I was in high spirits. Seriously, I felt so amazing.  


I came up to the finish line and saw my parents and my girlfriend. After a quick kiss and some hugs I ran across the finish line. 14:40 was my time. I had fished way faster than I thought! The weird part was, I still wasn't tired. I was on a huge high. They took everyone's picture with Chrissie Wellington handing out your medal.

In previous races I've always gone out off to the side to avoid having a pack swim by/over me, but after spending a couple shorter races as part of that middle-pack I think that is the spot for me, pace-wise.

My problem is, I have trouble gauging my pace out in the open water, and when I get in a pack, or on someone's feet for that matter, I don't know how I am going to be able to tell if that's the speed I am going to want to go.

I know the simple answer to this, and that is to judge by effort level.  If you feel like you can go faster, do it, but if you feel overly exerted, find slower feet to draft.  But I was hoping for a couple tips or tricks you guys have used to make sure you end up drafting off the the right person or the right group once you hit the open water.

Thrilled to pieces to accomplish what I did. Feel free to ask questions if you are considering this race.

Times (rounded): Swim: 1:14 Bike: 6:27 Run: 4:27

Prep:
Logistics were terrifying, and I probably overpacked. Better that way though. I ended up packing changes of clothes in each gear bag. No biggie. Breakfast was a bagel with honey and peanut butter and a Boost shake (high carbs, 15g protein), plus a Gatorade. I took a 5-hour energy at around 545, too. That's my go-to morning coffee replacement for races so I was experienced in it.
 
Swim:
Prepped wetsuit and jumped in the warmup area a few minutes early. Got a few quick drill paces in, and loosened up. Underestimated/conservatively placed myself in the 1:31-1:45 swim wave. I figured that was ok, because I would rather pass than be passed. Fought the crowd to settle in, and swam the out leg no problem. Got a little frustrated by people doing breast stroke and taking up a ton of room, but what can you do. Turned, and found a nice open space right on the cable for a few buoys on the back leg. Felt super comfortable and relaxed. Came out of the water and glanced at the clock. Quick math told me about 37 minutes for the first loop. And I wasn't at all winded. I was pretty happy, but cautious since that was faster than I have ever done a HIM swim leg. Got back in and settled right back in on the cable. Those numbered buoys are huge and I ended up crashing into them, then having to just go under a few of them. Was no big deal though, since it kept me on the cable. Came out of the water feeling fantastic. I almost wanted to do a third leg. :) Missed the clock, but made my way to transition.
 
T1: A few jog steps, but mostly walking, I got to transition and quickly found my bike bag. Honestly, I have no idea if it was raining but I went into the tent and sat to change. I took my time changing, breathing, settling, even had time to make some jokes. Took a last glance around before handing my stuff ot the volunteer to re-pack. Exiting the tent, I headed around to the bikes. The caller missed my number so my bike wasn't retrieved. I had to go down my row to grabe it. Oh well. Trotted to bike out to get spinning.
 
Bike: Grueling. I got started with arm warmers in my hand. I couldn't decide how warm it was, and whether I wanted to wear them. After the initial downhills, I slipped them around my wrists, and eventually pulled them about halfway up. I stayed steady on the first climb, and passed a few people going up. Hills don't usually bother me too much so I wasn't worried that I was going 9mph and they were going 8mph. After the first climb I tried to just relax and crank around a relaxed 85-90rpm, gearing to maintain cadence and less concerned with speed. Coasted most downhills, spinning a bit just to try to stay loose and flush lactic acid. My plan going in was to take an electrolyte bottle and a water bottle at each aid station. The perform went into my aero bottle (I started with gatorade there), with another perform in my seatpost cage. The water I used to pour on myself, refresh, rinse my mouth a little, sip a bit, then discard by the end of the aid station. I also had my personal nutrition (Stinger waffles and energy bars) and salt tabs every 30minutes. About 35-40 miles in, my IT band on my left leg started acting up. It got worse and worse, progressing from discomfort to ache to pain. It wasn't enough to force me out, and I was pretty sure I wasn't ""injured."" Finished the first loop and headed around for the second. I jacked up my watch, but told myself it didn't really matter. No special needs stop needed. I kept grinding, getting bored and ready to be done at about 105 miles. I came around to the end in pretty good pain. I was never more looking forward to run a marathon.
 
T2: Dropped my bike at the gate and jogged/highstepped to to bag rack. Trying to get loose and testing my knee. It wasn't too bad once the hill grinds were done so I was pretty happy with that. Grabbed my run bag and into the ten I went. Changed out, double checked, and off I went.
 
Run: Out the gate and down the hill. Felt surprisingly goot considering. I took off the arm warmers and stuffed them into my pocket. I had my gels on my belt and my salt tabs in my pocket. I had my hand bottle with water and my visor. I concentrated on slowing down on the downhill, focusing on cadence and relaxing. I did salt tabs every 15min and a gel every 30. Walked each aid stop, taking a perform cup at least, plus water and ice as needed. The first out was longer than I expected. I felt great though, even though my pace was ""only"" 10min/mi. I turned around and headed back in. I had to pee about mile 6, then every 2 miles after that. That was a great sign for me, and I'd rather take the extra 15 seconds than be forced to walk from dehydration and cramping. I kept shuffling and clicking off miles. Felt really good coming up the hill back into town. Stopped at special needs for lubrication. My toes were starting to bother me, but nothing major to report. Continued on and headed back out the second loop. I tried to pick up a little, but realized I had a half marathon left. Tried to push under 10min/mi, and made that sometimes. Took some chicken broth somewhere around mile 16. Delicious. I also had my gum with me, which was a nice treat to break up all that perform and gel. Turned the first out, and it sunk in that I was going to make it. I was ecstatic and then back in flew by. Got to the hill into town and shuffled on up. Everyone walking, me ""running,"" I felt great. I saw my family on my way to the last out-and-back. Awesome. The cheering crowds were amazing. As I came back in, the emotion was awesome. Entering the oval. Amazing. I got passed by a guy finishing strong (where was that the rest of his race?). Did not care. I almost didn't want to finish because I didn't want it to be over. Almost. Crossing the finish line, I couldn't believe it. I had done it. I almost collapsed, not from exhaustion, but from relief. The volunteers were so sweet. They offered me a wheelchair. They offered a foil wrap. I declined both. The girl, probably half my size, ""carried"" me towards the back. :) I was totally fine, but somewhat in shock. She grabbed my hat and shirt. I grabbed a quick finisher photo then went to find my family. Amazing.
 
 
After: I felt good. Tired. Sore. But good. We drove home Monday and I was ok the whole way. No cramping at all. My IT band was killing me, but it was an easy pain to tolerate. Tuesday I stayed home from work to ""recover."" Wednesday I had my massage and she got out a few knots. IT is still tight. I've been icing and using compression pants to help heal. Resting so far. 
 
My next race is Nations, early September. I plan to start with some easy spinning, light running, and slow swimming this week and early next. Then I'll start speed work during the week, with some longer stuff on weekends. I also registered for Savageman 70.0. I figure my fitness level right now is the highest it's ever been, so it's a good season for it. My last race of the season will be the Marine Corps Marathon. I kind of wanted to try to qualify for Boston, but I think this year the times for my age group will be excessively competitive. Last year, my BQ time was around 3:10.

I raced in my first Sprint Triathlon yesterday, placed 3rd in my AG and 6th overall. I'm hooked! Here are some things that I've learned along the way.",21,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1j8zz2/after_deciding_to_join_the_world_of_triathlon/,"During those months of training and research online, visiting forums, blogs and of course, /r/triathlon, I was able to soak up so much useful information and get so many tips that really helped my overall performance and transition times. Here are the main things that stick out to me that really helped me: 

* Bringing a 5 gallon bucket to transport your things to transition and to flip over to sit on when putting on/taking off cleats/running shoes. (Haven't mastered putting on cleats while already clipped in to the pedals)

* Baby powder on your transition mat/towel to dry your feet and get the sand off of your feet when coming from the water

* Nutrition! Even though it was a sprint, having nuun tabs in my water bottle and clif bloks in my gear bag on my bike helped me out immensely. It was hot during the race and I lost a lot of fluid throughout the race. 

* PAM on the arms and legs to help take off the wetsuit easily. I thought it would work, just not as well as it really did. Helped me out immensely. 

* Bringing a plastic bag to put your arms/legs in to slip in to your wetsuit easily. Before I found out about this trick, I was exerting *way* too much energy trying to get in to my wetsuit before the race.

* Stretching my legs while on the bike, before getting off to go run. Saved me time in transition, so I was nice and fresh getting off the bike. 

* On the last leg of the run, one thing stuck in my head and that was ""Embrace the suck!"" That's one major message that I took away from reading ""I'm Here To Win!"" by Macca. Just repeating that to myself, put me in the mindset to turn on the jets, empty the tank and give it my all. It allowed me to pass up 2 runners on my way to the finish line.

I can already tell that I'm going to be competing in triathlons until I'm no longer able to physically compete. They're just too much damn fun. Every single person that I met was so nice and friendly. There were other fellow first-timers there that I connected with and we all kind of shared the same feelings and first-timer fears. That helped get rid of the jitters a lot. I have no idea why I was so afraid of open water swimming before. Aside from getting kicked in the head 3x by the guy doing breast stroke ahead of me, it wasn't bad at all. I've registered for two more tri's this year and there will be plenty more after that. I finally feel like I belong to something now, which is a really, really cool feeling. Thanks, /r/triathlon.

I can run 3 miles fine. I ride now with my long rides around 30 miles (avg. 17mph or so). The kicker...I have not swam for fitness in AGES!

Since I've been young, my parents have always bashed triathletes for not swimming more (both lifelong swimmers as well).

I've been at the first turn buoy (200 yards) with 5 people on my kayak hanging out. Why not train harder for the swim so as to save energy for the bike and run? I figure the faster and stronger one can swim, the more energy you'll save for the vastly longer bike and run portions. 

tl;dr more yards training for the swim: easier swim, less energy spent struggling. 

Edit: Thanks for all the answers. Ironically, I was at the pool waiting for my coach to open the pool at 5a. What I'm gathering is that if y'all had time, you would train more for swimming?

Do you think it's realistic to do a full Ironman with 8 months of training, or should I shoot for a 70.3 next Spring and wait to do a 140.6 until the fall?",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,Tri-Flair,True,t3_ztq0c,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/ztq0c/full_ironman_in_8_months/,

I am really struggling with breathing in my freestyle swim.  I'm quite new to this stroke (always done breast stroke before I started tri training), and I'm finding it hard to master!

My issue is the exhaling.  I find it SO HARD to exhale properly under water.  Like, it feels like I have to work really hard to push the air out of my mouth. I think because of this I don't get all the air out, so when I inhale (I'm inhaling every 3rd stroke, well trying to) my lungs are still half full, and I just end up with really shallow breath.  Then I get short of oxygen and just too out of breath to keep swimming.

I feel like I must be doing something wrong.  I tried just exhaling and letting myself sink to the bottom, as I'd read to do this as a training drill.  Even when I felt like my lungs were empty I still ended up floating back towards the surface, so I took that to mean they still had air in, but I can't seem to find a way to expel that last bit of air properly underwater.

Weirdly, in breaststroke, I exhale underwater every stroke and seem to be able to maintain this fine. Maybe because I'm exhaling more quickly?

I can happily swim my sprint tri distance in breaststroke, but with this breathing problem I can barely manage 50m in freestyle without stopping.  Help!

**TL;DR how the hell do you breathe out properly underwater without ending up breathless?**

EDIT: Wow guys, thanks so much, you are all so kind to take the time to help.  Fantastic to have so much advice and suggestions, I will try lots of the different suggestions and see how I get on.  Thank you again!

I did this sprint once and was super pumped and been feeling great and fast all summer and wanted to get a top 5 finish at it. So I get there, start the swim and my bib belt and number slide down and entangle my feet for a while slowing me down. Not a huge deal, I get outta the water, get on the bike and hammer hard. This course is hilly and I get into a little dual with two other guys. We keep volleying back and  forth passing each other just for a few hundred feet then battling all over again. Eventually I decide to be more aggressive and since I'm light, I decide to get at the next hill. This whole time I'm putting back water cause it's hot as hedes' ass. I hit the hill, humming bird myself up it, reach the top with a souring heart rate thinking I have a flat to recover on but of course, another hill. I have my lead now and refuse to lose so I give everything I can on this one and once I reach the top, I begin to projectile vomit at 21mph off my bike. Nothing but water but it hurt. I didn't want to pull over unless I was dizzy so I held out. The two guys I was volleying with before looked at me, wrote me off for dead(naturally) and past right by me. I was so disappointed. Broken and beaten. I gathered myself as best as possible and somehow got another shot of life and went at it as best as I could. I ended up catching up and passing the two guys from before. They.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I've noticed in the last several triathlons I've done your race bibs have been used for the events. I understand that my sport would basically not exist if it weren't for sponsorships, and I appreciate your company's enthusiastic support. I'm one of (I assume many people) who in the past have always saved these race bibs and even posted them in my office as a sort of ""certificate of completion"" of an event and as a conversation starter with similarly-inclined co-workers. I've always enjoyed keeping these bibs because they show the name, date, location and event logo, and as a result they're actually more interesting and meaningful to me than a t-shirt that gets worn only on weekends or silly medal. However, because the ""generic"" race bibs provide by your company contain none of this information, to me they've lost the interesting bits that made them worth keeping and showing off. If you kept your bib style exactly as it is, but moved your logo to the left (or right) and made room for the event logo with the date and location, these would once again be worth saving. I understand this would involve additional custom printing expense, but hopefully it would be worthwhile considering the extra visibility your company would gain by making these bibs worth keeping.

Here's my race report I sent to coach and posted on fb (left out the beer part since I didn't want a lecture from coach, haha)

Went to bed at 8PM the night before, and got up at 3:30 AM day of. Had a good breakfast and several cups of coffee. Our hotel was having issues with the shuttle bus, so I didn't get to transition til about 6:20 (it was supposed to close at 6:40). Got there to check my bike and the front tire had flatted...no big deal, I'm very quick at changing them, and I had packed two spares. Got it changed, and then noticed my bike shirt was missing from the bag. It may have fallen out during my or their transport of the bag after my bike check-in, but who knows? Not much I could do about that, so I just figured I'd wear my swim skin during the bike since it was only supposed to be 77 and overcast...Also, I'd accidentally left my timex GPS/hr monitor watch on overnight, so there went that.....

SWIM: Full mass start. Water was crystal clear. It was absolutely beautiful. I got pushed outside the main lane once or twice and got a tad off course, but that was it. Otherwise, I was able to get into a rhythm pretty well. Never really found a pack my pace to draft off for more than a few minutes. Came out of the swim feeling great.

BIKE: Was already over 77 and really sunny, so I knew I was in trouble if I used the swim skin, but I had nothing else (shirts are required or you get penalty/DQed), so I just went with it. The course was set up as a sort of rectangle around the southern 2/3 of the island. You started in middle of the island on the western coast, went south, turned east and road along the southern coast, and then north, turned west again and went through the citied portion. There was a southeasterly wind about ~15mph with 25 mph gusts, so it felt like a headwind for the first two portions, then you got a tailwind for the third, and then final was winding through the city, so you didn't feel much. I got my first flat (rear) about mile 25. Took me about 5 min to change it, am normally quicker but my hands were a bit stiff and I had troubles getting the tire back on. Finished the first loop, and was starting to feel really warm. I unzipped the back of my swim skin to trade sunburn for a bit of ventilation, and was dumping cold water every chance I got back there, but by about mile 50 I was burning up. Stopped at bike special needs station at mile 54ish and traded my swim skin (luckily I only paid $3 for it on ebay) to one of the volunteers for his bright orange volunteer t-shirt. 

5 miles later I flatted AGAIN. I had used my last tube for the last flat, and was really worried I was done, but someone happened to pass by with a 44mm stem tube after a little while, and i had forgotten i packed an extender in my bike bag. Got going again after about 30-40 min. Race was uneventful again for a while. I went through all my GU's sooner than I thought, but they had plenty at the aid stations (even if they were the horrible, awful, disgusing, chocolate PowerBar brand ones). I had some minor cramping in hip flexors, glutes, and adductors for most of the race but nothing in the quads, hams, or calves, so I wasn't worried. Started pouring rain about mile 100, and the wind changed direction, so I missed out on the tailwind I was supposed to get on the last section (may not seem like a big deal, but I honestly wanted to cry at the time).

RUN:

Mostly uneventful, honestly thought I ran a lot closer to a 4:00 but I didn't have my watch so I'm in no position to argue with the clock. It was pouring rain for a good chunk of the first half, and there were intersections knee deep in water to trudge through, so that may have had something to do with it. I do know I tore up my last 10k though....passed 2 or 3 hundred people during that alone.

Overall impression: Beautiful course, fantastic support from the locals, great volunteers, well supported. Also, very hot, windy, and humid. Roads are not the best though.

**Pre-race**

Having packed the bike box, the ridiculous amount equipment that goes with any triathlon I got my arse over to Inverness on the plane the laborious part of the process was done.

I picked up the rental car that we would use for the race, I managed to rope in my brother as my support runner and my mum for car driving duties on race day, a quick food &amp; drink shop at Tescos on the way and I was soon at the cottage in Shieldaig and enjoying the peace and quiet the small village had to offer.

I arrived on Monday afternoon so had some days to chill out with the place all to myself, one day it was raining all day so I decided rather than sit in and do nothing I would go recce the bike route, I'm glad I did, I stopped on the way taking photos and taking in the breathtaking scenery, I'm ashamed to say I had never once been to Scotland, I will be revisiting for sure, it's an amazing place to visit.

After seeing the bike route, I took in the climbs and made some mental notes of where I could go harder and any major bumps/holes in the road I need to be aware of, I also counted about 8-10 cattle grids, I'd never crossed a grid on my bike before and was a little cautious as to whether the side-gates would be open and manned on the day, knowing how dangerously slippery wet tram tracks can be on 23c tyres, in the end I need not have worried, as long as you hit them dead straight, held your bars a little loose and unweighted the saddle you just floated over them without issue.

With that done I chilled out and went to pickup my support crew members at the airport later in the week. We went to officially register and do the mandatory kit check and the day after had the race briefing which was very well organised and humorous; as the mic was passed over to the co-race organiser who covered the bike section his first words were ""if you get lost on the bike, you're a moron"" :-D

I must also say a cool additional feature of the Celtman was the **[live tracking system](http://www.cxtri.com/track/)** that a bloke called Andy Upton had developed, a white box a little smaller than a packet of cigarettes kept our support crew and families &amp; friends back home up to date with our current position via GPS/GSM for the bike &amp; running legs (so much better than those live tracking sites that just give you simple start/end leg live info), oh.. and **it worked**! The number of times triathlons fail to get this stuff to work is embarrassing, the system was primarily for safety more than anything but it proved very useful for all the support crews to figure out when/where refuelling on the bike would take place and when their athletes would come into transition.

The night before the race my mind was racing, I couldn't shut it up, I was a little concerned, I wanted to try and get a good night's sleep before the race as the night before that I had only managed 5 hours, despite the black-out blinds on my room the light still managed to sneak in. In the end I think I got half an hour the night before the race, although once I got up, had a shower and put some music in my ears I was feeling positive about what was about to come...

**Race day morning**

I lucked out on the location of the cottage, the swim/T1 was a 2 minute walk and the coaches that would bus us out were literally opposite us, so, unlike a lot of the other competitors I was able to get up a bit later.

We walked over to T1, racked the bike, I was eyeing the other bikes around me in transition, hoping to see some other deep dish wheels, as over the days I had kept checking the weather which over the week got gradually worse in terms of wind speeds &amp; likelihood of rain.

*Side note: Unfortunately I had to pack my 60mm carbon clinchers as when I was packing my bike before travelling over a spoke spontaneously popped in my skinnier carbon clinchers when they were just resting up against the wall! The tyres had been deflated ready for packing and suddenly like a gunshot one of the front spokes just snapped :( the idiots at the bike shop must have way overtightened them when I got my bike serviced, needless to say I'll not be using them again!*

Anyway, it seems that a bunch of other people had deeper wheels than me so I felt more comfortable, with the bike, we set up my bucket-o-T1 with everything in, towel on top to make sure everything didn't blow out and we walked back to get me on the coach which would take us to the start of the swim.

The coach quickly filled up me semi-naked wetsuit clad people, a cacophony of tri-geek talk later and the coach was out the swim start field which was filled with a line of torches, the Celtman symbols on fire and a bag-piper which really helped to set the mood for the start of our long day.

**The Swim**

The organisers got us all to **[line up for a group photo](http://stevecarter.com/Celtman13/1a.jpg)**, I'm standing to the right of the guy with the sleeveless wetsuit (pretty brave I thought going in with that!), they then told us it was 5 minutes until race start, two of the kayaks denoted the invisible start line. We all waded in, everyone in their own thoughts, I had noticed while we were waiting around that a lot of other competitors were wearing neoprene booties, one guy I got talking to had even duct-taped sealed them to his wetsuit, I was wondering if this was going to affect my swim but figured that cold feet don't really bother me at all.

I did my usual splashing water in my face routine to make my body freak-out/get used to the water temperature, stuck my head under and did a few test strokes. Initially I found my breathing my quite restricted, I couldn't breathe out, ""2 minutes to race start!"" came the words from the organiser's megaphone, I tried again but my breathing wouldn't settle down, ""oh well"" I thought, ""I'll sort it on the way"", but as the race horn was sounded and the vigorous splashing got under way I found my body had calmed and I started the race without issue...

The swim as I understood had been shortened by 800m (3km instead of 3.8km), so instead of an initial north swim and then to shore we just had to keep the 2 big islands to out right and make a beeline for the jetty at Shieldaig, I believe it was due to the temperature being a little colder than expected, the race briefing said the local fishermen had put it between 11-13 celsius so warmer than the 10 degrees of last year but still cold!

The swim started out easy enough, I settled into my rhythm quickly enough and a few overtakes later I found some people who were going about the same speed and I started drafting. Keeping behind the people was a little difficult at times as the popularity of black booties made it hard to see feet, so often I was chasing bubbles and not people and using my sighting to ensure I was staying behind the people I had chose.

During the entire day there was an ever increasingly north easterly wind which kicked up the chop each time we were out of the ""shadow"" of the 2 islands, you had to remember to breathe out of the nose when sighting lest you get a snout-full of cold salt water which more than once burnt the back of my throat.

The pack continued to spread out, I was sighting off the islands and people, it was a little frustrating as the last island seemed to stay on the horizon for ages, I wondered if we would ever pass it!

As we finally came by it the chop settled down and the jellyfish increased in numbers, it was cool to see, the water was clear and hundreds of all different sizes just passed by like some psychedelic show, it was a nice distraction as the cold was starting to get to my right hand, which by now had turned into a kind of claw, I couldn't keep my fingers together to catch the water properly but carried on as normal, luckily I suffered no problems with muscle cramps as I had heard some people experienced last year.

As the row of little houses appeared in the distance, so did the line of torches that signalled the jetty swim exit, at this point I decided to keep that as my guide and disregard other competitors and where they went, by now the pack either side was quite spread out as the current hit us diagonally, I figured we probably had just another kilometre or so to go.

---

**Transition 1**

Soon enough we were all pouring out the water, I got up and out without too many problems, my legs felt a big heavy as they always do after a swim like that, I was pleased to see my swim time was as I wanted (I had checked a couple of times before while I was swimming). My brother came and grabbed me and directed me to transition, my teeth started chattering a bit, I sat down opposite my bike and he ripped the wetsuit off me.

Mum handed me a lid full of warm orange... it was SO good to drink that, get some warmth in me and get rid of the stinging salt water that lined the back of my throat.

On went my bike jersey etc. grabbed my bike and was out quickly enough to start the bike...

Been logging the miles in my newly acquired used road bike, just did a 5k this weekend, life is good. I've been putting off swimming since I signed up but decided to bite the bullet and go down to my community pool today for some laps.

After watching a few youtube videos I felt confident that I would not die so into the water I went. Most lanes were filled with fast swimmers so I chose one with an old guy I thought would be slow (he was not). I put on my Target Speedo goggles, fired up my Timex Ironman watch and spent the next 25 minutes flailing in the water. To my credit towards the end I felt like I was getting the hang of breathing.

That's my biggest problem, breathing. I'm sure I am not alone in this, hence my posting here. I almost drowned in a lake three years ago and ever since water has scared me. This triathlon is taking me out of my comfort zone and I want to face my fear head on. What was your first swim like? What were some of the best resources you used to learn?

I loved the feeling of pushing myself to the max and applying the knowledge I am learning in school (sports nutrition major) to myself so I've decided to try and be ready for an Ironman 70.3 in a year. Specifically the Ironman 70.3 Austin, TX on Oct 27, 2013. 


I have gotten my sprint tri time down to the low 1:20s (big part of that was getting a new/used bike). Now I am training for distance and my plan is to add a mile to my long bike and 0.25 mile to my long jog each week which would set me up to be doing 70.3 distances by the end of the summer with room for giving myself an extra week occasionally. 


My issue is that I have never jogged longer than 5 miles nonstop though have done some 6 and 7 mile runs with a jog 3 min/walk 1 min type pace. My training schedule is like this:


**Monday** - Bike to and from school 5 mi each way (10 mi  total)

**Tuesday** - Bike to and from school 5 mi each way (10 mi  total)
              Jog at night/evening my distance for that week, this week is 4 miles

**Wednesday** - Bike to and from school twice 5mi each way (20mi total)

**Thursday** - Bike to and from school 5 mi each way (10 mi  total)
              Jog at night/evening my distance for that week, this week is 4 miles

**Friday** - no school so long bike at the distance for the week (20 mi this week)

**Saturday** - brick run bike distance for the week (20mi) followed by jog distance for the week (4mi)

**Sunday** - rest!

Currently not swimming as my work/class hours don't coincide with open lap times at the pool but as I was able to do a comfortable 30 min mile swim by end of summer so I'm not too worried about it and I'll add that back in the spring. 

In summary is 1 year enough time to go from sprint tri to 70.3 and is a long brick run every week going to start being too much to recover from in 1 day once I get to longer distances?

Sorry I haven't been able to get you an update; I had a race last weekend and have been working off-site somewhere that I didn't have a computer, so I couldn't use my ~~company time~~ lunch hour to get on reddit/surveymonkey to do a long post.

I posted a second survey [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/zeh90/do_you_want_rtriathlon_gear_let_us_know_updated/) a few weeks ago to figure out how badly we wanted to have /r/triathlon kit (as opposed to reddit kit), and I had a disappointing 38 respondents. The responses were as follows:

**what kind of design (art/layout) would your purchase on /r/triathlon gear?**

&gt; generic reddit or /r/bicycling design

* 18.4% (7) - definitely would purchase
* 47.4% (18) - probably would purchase
* 28.9% (11) - probably would not purchase
* 5.3% (2) - definitely would not purchase

&gt; reddit or /r/bicycling design + /r/triathlon aliens/wording

* 28.9% (11) - definitely would purchase
* 63.2% (24) - probably would purchase
* 5.3% (2) - probably would not purchase
* 2.6% (2) - definitely would not purchase

&gt; custom /r/triathlon design

* 42.1% (16) - definitely would purchase
* 50.0% (19) - probably would purchase
* 7.9% (3) - probably would not purchase
* 0% (20) - definitely would not purchase

**if i were to buy some kit, i would want my /r/triathlon gear to:**

&gt; match /r/bicycling kit

* 2.6% (1) - definitely agree
* 31.6% (12) - somewhat agree
* 47.4% (18) - indifferent
* 13.2% (5) - somewhat disagree
* 5.3% (2) - definitely disagree

&gt; clearly represent reddit

* 55.3% (21) - definitely agree
* 42.1% (16) - somewhat agree
* 2.6% (1) - indifferent
* 0.0% (0) - somewhat/definitely disagree

&gt; clearly represent /r/triathlon (as opposed to /r/bicycling)

* 42.1% (16) - definitely agree
* 28.9% (11) - somewhat agree
* 28.9% (11) - indifferent
* 0.0% (0) - somewhat/definitely disagree

With just 38 responses, I'm led to believe that either people didn't really care about the specifics of a reddit triathlon top/shorts/suit or that the wind fell out of the sails pretty quickly. I'm unsure of what to do, but we probably need to decide as a group if we're going to either hope to get onboard with [r/bicycling's order] (http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/zzrdo/2013_reddit_jerseys_start_your_design_engines/) and meet the minimums for triathlon gear OR if we're going to get enough people to make our own purchase.

Please discuss; you guys are as at least as in control of which way this goes.

1345304191.0,12,self.triathlon,yfimb,Bilateral breathing and a question on pool etiquette,12,0,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/yfimb/bilateral_breathing_and_a_question_on_pool/,"Like a lot of newbie triathletes (at least those that weren't swimmers beforehand) I've been struggling with my bilateral breathing. I always favor my left side and have struggled to breathe on my right. Finally today I managed a full 50m length with bilateral breathing with a pull buoy and almost a full length bilaterally breathing without the pull buoy (more about that in a moment). 

It's been a combination of things working up to this but the main points are:

* relaxing and being comfortable in the water (this was my 4th trip to the pool in 5 days which has helped!),
* keeping my stroke long (and hence reasonably slow), 
* doing lengths (with and without the pull buoy) breathing just on my ""wrong"" side (I like breathing one side up the pool, and the other side back),
* finally, and most importantly I think, not actively breathing out underwater. By this I mean that I don't concentrate on breathing out (I think about other things: keeping stroke long, keeping head horizontal etc) and as such air just kind of trickles out of my nose. Then if there is any left before I'm due a breath I just quickly exhale it as my mouth is exiting the water. 

Hope that made sense and maybe it'll help others struggling with bilateral breathing. 

The reason I ""almost"" did 50m bilaterally without the pull buoy was that around 10m from the end I caught up with another guy in the lane and had to switch to breaststroke to avoid hitting him. I therefore had a question about lanes in the pool:

My pool usually has 4 lanes open for public swim: a slow, two medium and a fast lane. (As a side note, I usually think of the medium lane next to the fast lane as faster than the medium one next to the slow lane: is that a reasonable assumption?). I was in the second medium lane (next to the fast lane). Initially it was me and a woman and we were reasonably matched (both primarily doing freestyle) and all was good. Then a guy entered our lane and started doing slow breaststroke (he was slower than the couple of people in the slow lane). If there had only been two people in the lane it would have been okay (although there would have been a lot of overtaking) but with three it made it very hard to overtake without risking head on collisions. 

Unfortunately there were 3 people in the fast lane at a much much faster pace than me (they looked pretty damn pro) so I couldn't shift into that one without causing more problems. There was plenty of space in the slow lane (or the other medium lane) but he stayed in the lane, and when I would catch up with him by the end of a length he would go straight into his next length (if that ever happens to me I normally let the faster person go first). In the end I just had to put up with it as best as I could. I don't mean to sound like a dick about this, I totally respect anyone in the pool, we're all there for the fun and fitness at the end of the day. 

So is there anyway to suggest him to move, or am I being unrealistic/a dick for thinking he should have moved? I haven't been swimming ""properly"" for a huge amount of time so don't know what the etiquette is...

**TL,DR: I managed bilateral breathing for the first time. Also, is there a polite way to get someone to shift lanes? Am I being a dick by thinking they should?**

I know that I won't get the full benefit from a proper tri bike from just putting clip on aero bars on my bike. In particular I probably need the tri-specific frame geometry to really get into the position where I can minimize the use of my running-muscles, but since clip on aero bars are a relative small investment it might still be worth it.

Any tips?",12,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1h7has/any_offroad_triathletes_here_first_xterra_coming/,"I've completed a couple dozen road triathlons over the past eight years or so, ranging from sprints to half irons.  I typically finish toward the front overall in small sprint races, on or just off the AG podium in Oly distance, and somewhat better than middle of the AG pack at half iron.  Looking to qualify for XTERRA Nats this fall and am signed up for three races this summer, all in the Pac NW region.

I have made the following adjustments to my training this year:

* More focus on the swim - As a strong cyclist, I have always let the swim training slide, knowing I could get better race gains by being one of the top cyclists.  Assuming I won't be able to pass weaker cyclists as easily on the singletrack, I have worked pretty hard this year to make sure I come out of the water closer to where I need to be on the bike.

* Technical bike skills.  I have a long weekend-warrior history of mountain biking, but I have tried to get out on the trails several times this year specifically to work on the fast downhill riding.  I have never raced my mountain bike, but assume that a strong cyclist can easily botch their race through timid downhill riding, much moreso than in road tris.

* Trail running, duh.  I started back in February or so, figuring my ankles, etc would need 80-100 miles to adjust to the uneven footing.  Currently at about 100 miles of trail running for the year, with a few more trail runs in the 5-9 mile range planned before race day.

* Nutrition seems trickier.  For Oly-distance road tris I typically eat a gel before the swim, one or two on the bike at scheduled times, and carry one on the run in case I start flagging.  I've already discovered that in mountain biking, and to some extent trail running, you eat when you CAN, not when you are supposed to.  Still sort of fine tuning this.  What about aid stations?  Seems to me by necessity they would be less frequent and/or more randomly placed.  Should I carry a small water bottle on the run?  All three of my planned races have a good chance of being pretty warm.

* Any big differences in transition?  I couldn't really think of any.

* Anything else?  Helpful tips, tricks, experiences, anecdotes???

Thanks!  I'll post a race report and/or pics after my first one if you'd like.  It is XTERRA La Grande on July 20.  I'm hoping for at least a top 10 in AG finish.

I Finally got around to completing my first Half Ironman on the weekend after years of thinking about it (I ran the half marathon leg for a team in 2008 and promised myself I would come back to do the whole thing).

I am curious to find out what the readers of /r/triathlon perceive as an ""elite"" half Ironman time? 

Within running circles there is generally accepted rough or loosely defined time barriers for particular distances that are considered elite and would probably separate really good runners from excellent runners; e.g sub 30 minute 10km, sub 70 minute half marathon etc.
What would be the Half Ironman equivalent for these times? Obviously there is a lot more variables in a half Ironman and weather conditions etc. have a much greater impact so it would be fairly ballpark. 

The times for the male pro category on the weekend ranged from 3:45 to 4:19. Would it be safe to assume something under 4:19 would be ""elite"". It's worth noting that the 3:45 winning time was the course record and all the pro category times where generally faster that the previous few years, owing to the ideal racing conditions.

I have, however, just seen in my local paper that there is a triathlon being held in my town in a week and a bit's time. It's less than a sprint - a 400m swim, a 10 mile bike, and a 5k run - and quite a chilled out affair. I can easily manage the bike and run phases, but I have no clue how feasible the swim is - let alone combined with the other two phases.

I'm a reasonably fit guy, capable of running about a 21 minute 5k etc, but have no swimming experience. I will be doing this purely for the hell of it, in no way competitively. 

My question is purely, oh experienced triathletes, will it be possible to add in a 400m swim in a week from scratch, or will I be dead in the water?

When I signed up for it (about 9mths prior) I was comfortable with the bike and run but my swim was woeful; I could only swim breaststroke whilst keeping my head out of the water. I worked hard, signed up to some adult technique classes at my Uni's pool, and by the time the race came around I could swim the race distance alternating 100m freestyle 50m breaststroke. When the race itself came around the open water was a bit intense, I got kicked a few times in the first 100m or so and ended up completing the swim with breaststroke.  Nevertheless I was chuffed to finish the race in just over 3hrs (in 100+F heat) and left tri for a while. 

I've spent the last two years mainly doing ballet (random, I know) but a friend has asked me to do an Olympic Tri with him next year. I'm really excited to get back into training alongside my ballet (I reckon they'll complement each other rather well) but I don't know what to do about my swimming. 
I headed to the pool for the first time in many months last night and struggled to complete a 50m length in freestyle. Obviously I understand it'll take a while for me to get back my ""swim-fitness"" but does anyone have any good tips or plans for working on building up my freestyle distances? Ideally I'd like to complete the upcoming tri next year entirely with freestyle (it's an indoor swim so hopefully less kicking will be involved!)…

My transition times should be relatively quick since I have a pair of tri shorts, and using toe cages on the bike so I can just stick to my running shoes. 

Know I should minimize energy expenditure on the swim (going in with the intent to backstroke after a fifteen-30 second wait for the masses to move forward). Is there an equivalent for the bike/run segments?

Next time, I'm definitely going to train. Even if it's a sprint, that swim portion is a killer. 

It is important to put anti fog drops in your goggles. Couldn't see a thing. 

Next time I will wear a wetsuit. I was so cold I felt my body wasn't processing the air I was breathing in. 

How did so many people pass me on the bike? I thought it was one of my core strengths. I need to start training on the bike harder. It's not a bike ride with your girlfriend. It's a race, and I need to get used to the serious pace. 

Next time, I'm not going to wear my swim ware on the bike. My man parts hurt. Time to invest in some kind of tri garb. 

Sprint distance def didn't need bike shoes. Good thing too because I don't own any. But if I do a longer distance I may want to make the investment. 

Running was great. Maybe I didn't push myself hard enough during the bike, but the tank def wasn't empty. I could have easily run for another 30-45 min at a pace that had me passing a lot of people. 

All in all it was a fun race, and a great first race! It was important for me to see how it works (had lots of jitters about bringing the right gear, being in the right place at the right time, how the whole thing actually works, etc.). 

The biggest takeaway though I'd that if I want to do longer distances, which I do, I'm going to have to introduce a little discipline to my training. 

I see why you guys are hooked. Hopefully this time next year I'll be writing about my first Olympic distance.

HUGE LEARNING EXPERIENCE

Swim(300m) 5:53, T1 2:38, Bike(11.2mi) 37:15, T2 2:06, Run(2mi) 16:39

The swim I PR'd for pace, I feel like I could have picked up some more speed if it was longer, but I wasn't gassed coming out of the water. (Happy)

The bike, oh man, it started out great, and then at about mile 6, turning from Lindell to Blue Bluff as I am slowing down, they guy on the mega phone says slow down, my brakes lock or I nervously squeezed to hard and my back tire went out from under me.  It all happened so fast.  I slid into the volunteers separated from my bike and managed to hop up onto my feet.  They grabbed my bicycle threw the chain back on and checked the tires setting me back on my way.  

The worse part was a lady kept telling me it was on the big ring, which I didn't understand her tone until I got to peddling up the big hill and realized what she had been saying.  I swear if I hadn't fought the asphalt I would have done significantly better and been much closer to my average pace. (Frustrated) 

The run was brutal initially, my whole abdominals were screaming for some reason.  It wasn't the fasted I had run, and it wasn't debilitating, just the worst cramp/side stitch I have ever had.  My personal best for 1 mile is 7:11 and my personal best 5k is 25:02, so I am quite happy with my run time.  (Happy)

First priority areas of improvement are my transitions.  I forgot a sock on the run, and I feel like they could just be quicker.  It was a transition that was twice as big as TriWaco and more in's and outs than the Prairie Man so I will try and keep that in mind.

Positives, first tri of the season with a lot of firsts involved.  A great learning experience and I feel like I could have pushed harder.  So I will next time.

I was worried the day before when the announcer giving the brief kept using the phrase ""toughest ironman 70.3 in the world"" and it was tough. Easily the toughest thing I've done.
The swim apart from cold (just under 14C) was largely uneventful, but the bike and run courses were tough. 

It rained hard the entire ride, my softshell got saturated and I was freezing.  I managed to ride the entire first lap, but the climbing and cold had taken it's toll on my legs and I joined the small army of ""riders"" pushing the steeper hills. In total the bike course has 4000ft of climbing or 52 hills in 56 miles and the weather didnt make this easy. A lot of crashes and puctures that day. I completed the bike in a little over 4 hours which is slower than I wanted but I'll take it. I exited transition with about 5:20 on the clock. Should be ok to make the cut-off as that's my goal.


Unexpectedly my legs felt great and the rain had even stopped. Then l hit the first hill and they went to mush. I had no choice if I wanted to get 'round in one piece I'd have to do this sensibly. Anything that resembled a climb got walked, quickly, but still a walk. Flat or downhill got jogged. The 3 lap run has one stiff climb and a few small undulations so this worked well. I got half way 'round in 1:20, a quick mental calc told me this should work. At the start of my 3rd and final lap I ended up matching pace with a Scottish lady also on her first 70.3. We both were doing the same thing and kept each other company. It was a big help having someone to talk to on the increasingly quiet run course. Passed the mile marker saying just under 3 miles left. I checked the gps and had an hour on the clock. This is going to work. I could feel cramp coming on in my calves but my walk/run strategy seemed to be keeping it at bay.

My running mate had stayed with me and as we got round the final corner we both saw the clock and realised we could make this in under 8hrs. So we ignored the pain and picked up the pace for those last few meters. I couldn't believe it, despite the weather and awful hills I'd beaten my goal and made the cut-off my over 30 minutes. Best day ever.

Now how the hell do I get this temporary tattoo to come off?

It was a super sprint, with a 1/4 mile swim.  I finished significantly faster than I had hoped, and I felt really awesome about the run and especially the bike.  The swim did not go my way.

I'm prone to panic attacks to begin with, which doesn't help, I'm sure, but I got in the water, started my swim and just started to feel very out of breath and panicky.  Then I got kicked in the face, which sent me into a bit of an emotional tailspin.  I had moments of thinking I was going to have to pull out and DNF.  I was going to swim to one of the paddleboarders to breathe and regroup, and he had to rescue one of the swimmers.  So I kept going and stopped at the paddleboarder at the first turn.  

He was awesome and reassuring, and once I forced myself to breathe and get back into the proper headspace, I was okay. I probably stopped for less than a minute based on my swim time, but after that, I couldn't get into my groove.  I ended up doing a lot of side stroke to help with the breathing, though I tried to get back to my normal freestyle.  I struggled with veering off a bit, so I just did what I had to to keep moving.

What can I do to prevent the freakouts?  I'm planning to get as much OWS practice as I can, but do any of you experienced triathletes have any tips?  Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_1fzxb4,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1fzxb4/how_to_prevent_ows_panic/,

This isn't my first race, but it will probably be my coldest one ever. The forecast that day calls for a high of 52 and a low of 37. The race starts at 9am, so it will most likely be closer to the low than the high. Granted, the forecast can and probably will change, but it's usually pretty accurate. The swim and the run I'll handle fine, it's the bike ride that concerns me. My one consolation is that it will probably be over in less than an hour. 

Before you start thinking, ""Psh, 52 degrees, what a baby, that's not THAT cold..."" trust me when I say that to me, on a bike, it is very, VERY cold. If I were going for a ride in those temperatures I would wear literally every piece of thermal clothing I own. That's obviously not practical for a race.

I've never done triathlon before. Or at least, I've done a triathlon before when I was 11, and the swim was so short that everyone waded around the buoy, the bike leg was in a carpark, and the run was out to a cone and back on the beach. 

But my gammy knee keeps being gammy when I do distance running, and I have a bike, and I love swimming, so I thought 'why the hell not' and signed up for a sprint triathlon (500 / 20 / 5).


I trained  any specific intent other than finishing and going hard during the race. On the day I was super nervous - but dutifully packed my gear carefully for the transitions, strapped the car onto the back of the bike (or the other way round, I can't remember) and headed down to St Kilda. 


You've no doubt all been through this many times before but it felt very foreign yet familiar - the ritual of race pack collection, limb tagging, checking in the bike, setting up transition, then out to watch the earlier waves take off, check in my bag and get ready. 


Memories from the day...

* a homeless, apparently alcoholic man waiting patiently in the 20-deep queue for the portaloos, in grimy old clothes, stinking of booze, smoking a roll-up. Just about the antithesis of the entire event. 

* dude in his 50s, carbon fibre bike with carbon fibre wheels, teardrop racing helmet, everything as aerodynamic as you could possibly get, aside from the rider himself. He was easily as wide as one of his wheels. He must've killed it on the cycle leg though, it was a sweet bike. 

* got so cold waiting shirtless and shoeless for the swim to begin (just in my bathers and swim cap) that my teeth were chattering uncontrollably...getting into the water warmed me up whilst the wetsuiters were complaining about having to go in past genital depth! Hypothermia anyone??

* grinning maniacally to myself during the swim when I realised 'shit, I'm really enjoying this'

* having trained exhaustively to breathe both sides, I wasn't comfortable swimming in the midst of the others in my wave so sat off to the right, breathing on my left, and had a great clear swim without having to navigate too much. Probably an extra 25 metres swum all up, and no advantage from being towed along by others, but it was a good swim regardless. 

* salt water burns the sinuses, man, and ocean chop ensures you swallow a fair bit of salt water whilst breathing!

* T1 - shoes on before overshorts  is a pretty grevious error of judgement. FFFUUUUUUUUUU....ok next time then. 

* I was riding the ONLY steel-frame flat bar bike in the entire event. Everyone passed me on the upwind legs. I mean....the dude with the prosthetic leg, the girls in the 'Athena' division...I passed noone for the first 18km and only by putting in a superhuman effort on the final leg did I catch up with a couple of others who'd passed me. 

* Both calves cramping uncontrollably on T2. Whilst pushing a steel framed bike. They're still sore 3 days later. 

* the camaraderie between age-groupers...joking whilst in transition, giving me sh!t about my bike, gentle encouragement from all sides ('mate, riding that looks like fun!' 'onya mate, keep it up')

* no idea of pace off the bike and through the first km of the run. Honestly, I could've been doing 8 min kms or 3 min kms, I simply didn't know. Now I know why people wear GPS watches. 

* turns out I'm a better runner than I thought - noone in my category passed me and I caught at least 10 of them up over the 5km. 

* the 'like hell you are' moment when the guy in my category who'd been pacing off me from the 3.5km mark of the run came up on my shoulder with 750 to go. I know *exactly* where you are, buddy, and trust me on this, I ain't letting you past without a hell of a fight. Let's go then...and he dropped off! Testosterone FTW!

* the first time I've felt 'at the limit' at the end of a run. I know I couldn't have run the last 500 any faster. 

* disappointment with my time till I realised I was on race clock time but had started in the +20 minute wave. Woo hoo! 

* satisfaction and an immediate willingness to do the next one...really stoked with the event, it was a challenge and one I want to take on again. 

Thank you to those that provided advice (I posted for tips earlier on), certainly helped, esp the bricking. Only addition I'd make would be to say 'pack some slip-on shoes for pre-race, bring a hoody, bring a book'. 

So I guess that's me addicted then! Saving up for a new bike begins after Christmas...

I have splashed around in the lakes and ocean in the winter, but never for an extended time, so I'm not sure how I'd do in the swim without a wet suit.  I know all the benefits of it: warmth, bouyancy, etc. but I'm worried about the transition.  I'm a bigger guy, so getting it off is going to be a pain.

The suit arrived yesterday giving me no time to practice. So I was expecting the worst.

At the event, I suited up and got in the water for a briefing. My hands and feet felt like blocks of ice. Ducked under the water, cloudy, couldn't see a thing. This isn't going to be like a pool swim...

Set of and tried to focus on those around me to keep direction. The suit felt tight over my shoulders and it felt like I was fighting it on every stroke, probably not put it on quite right. I managed to avoid getting kicked in the head and didn't drown. Win.

I got out of the water with a swim time just under 7 minutes. I reached back, couldn't find the velcro tab at the top of the zip for ages, then I couldn't find the zip pull. Cursing myself for not at least practising this bit. I was nearly back at the bike before I got the zip undone. Anyway I finally got it off and jumped on the bike. Lost nearly minute in the transition which in this event is a fair few places.

Next time: practice, practice, practice, and make sure the suit is on my shoulders properly.

So I've been looking at the following:

1. 
[Garmin Forerunner 410 - Retails at $249](https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=142&amp;pID=83274)

Does just about everything I want it to, but my previous Garmin gave me lots of problems with charging, lossing signal at random times, and it was a mofo to install the drivers on Windows 7 x64 ultimate

----

2.
[Suunto Quest](http://www.suunto.com/us/en/products/Heart-Rate-Monitors/suunto-quest/suunto-quest-orange) - Retails for $249



I've never used Suunto product but again it does everything I want it to, and one of the podcast I listen to regularly ([Zen and the Art of Triathlon](http://www.zentriathlon.com/)) uses it and his data is always solid and seems to be pretty accurate. So I'm slightly leaning towards this one

I have a Garmin Edge 500 on my bike so I'm not concerned with a multisport function, I know Garmin just released their 910xt but it's too expensive for my taste. What do my fellow tri-its use?

1305646788.0,9,self.triathlon,hdfga,First Triathlon Experience,12,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/hdfga/first_triathlon_experience/,"I just completed my first sprint triathlon this past weekend. I played soccer in high school, but I'd never gotten into endurance sports before. I started swimming in college for recreation, took up barefoot jogging two summers ago to teach myself to like it, and after biking to work for over a year, I convinced myself I should try to combine them all and signed up in February.

Based on /r/triathlon's advice, I chose the Kinetic Sprint (.5 | 18 | 3.1 miles) at the Lake Anna State Park in Spotslvania, Virginia. I drove down the night before to attend an informational meeting and simply stayed at a hotel. The thunderstorm that pushed through Saturday night had me worried for a horrible race day. However, the overcast quickly broke into sun during the bike and it was gorgeous the rest of the day. I really couldn't have asked for better weather.

After setting up my bike, getting chipped and numbered, I threw on my rental wetsuit and lime green novice swim cap to splash around a bit before the race started. I was always confident about my swim and the warm up simply reinforced that feeling. However, the race conditions were a very different beast than a swimming pool.

The Swim:

So, I later learned that the swim is often dubbed ""The Washing Machine."" I wasn't used to running into feet, arms, and frothing water. My stroke was already pretty conducive to sighting, but it was also pretty good for swallowing other people's wake. Around the middle of the course when I merged with the age group ahead of the novices, I ended up having to tread water a few times to cough up the lovely lake water. The wetsuit was definitely helpful! I didn't reach a good groove until the last  ~250 meters, but was definitely beat by the time I hit the shore.

T1:

I got my wetsuit unzipped as I jogged to the transition area. I threw on a tri top and my vibram fivefingers. It took three tries to buckle my helmet due to fatigue. I grabbed my bike and got started.

The Bike:

So, to give some perspective. I am riding on a 37 year old road bike. It was so old as to be theft-proof at the metro. I threw on both water bottle and pedal cages. I was moderately impressed how well the pedal cages worked with the fivefingers (My toes slotted through comfortably enough). I wasn't planning on speed so much as simply finishing. I was recovering from the swim and the sun decided to come out. It made for great, scenic route around the lake.   
 
T2:

My second transition was the quickest. I was already wearing my running shoes and could simply drop off the bike and helmet and take off.

The Run:

Unfortunately, I hit my wall as the run began. I was simply spent and began cramping up. So, sad to say I ended up walking the first half of the 3 miles. I finally got some vigor back, got a good jog going, and finished with a sprint in the last .2 miles. I knew going into the race that the run was my weakest point. In retrospect, I should have practiced a lot more cycle-run bricks. It wasn't that my legs felt off. I simply didn't know how to handle the energy loss and properly pace myself.


I finished one minute under 2 hours. Under 2 hours was my upper goal.


They had a pizza coupon and a water bottle water at the end. The sun was shining and the The Lake Anna State Park was beautiful to just relax around. I cheered on some of the late finishers and eventually packed up to drive home.


I definitely enjoyed checking off the accomplishment. I'll probably do another one in the future with the lessons learned. I may try it with a real bike as well. The triathlon always seemed more appealing to me than other endurance sports due to the multiple training. I think I would get bored training for only one sport. I can only run or swim for so long.

This is my first step in to road to the Racine 1/2 Ironman in July. The experience was good and fun, but I also learned a few things along the way. Here are my impressions:

1. Don't start out too fast on the swim. I won my wave (18 laps in 10 minutes) but around the 8th lap I was struggling and had to take small 3-4 second rest stops at the wall. My swim training definitely helped me with speed, but I need to work on pacing myself. I don't want this to screw up my first OW swim.

2. The transition between the swim and the bike is 10 minutes, but you should still haul ass to the bike station. People forget that they need to properly set up the bike and that takes time. I arrived on time and was ready to go but forgot to tighten the screw that holds the seat up and it went down 1 minute into my biking. An organizer luckily set it up for me, but he set it up a bit too high and I was super uncomfortable and felt like those where the longest 30 minutes of my life. I was bouncing around and moving all over trying to get comfortable. I was second on the bike by only 0.1 mile.

3. The run went much better. I jogged from the bikes to the treadmills and this was the first time I could see how the bike impacts your runs. My legs felt like gelatin for those first few minutes. Luckily, the transition time was 5 minutes so I felt ready by the time the run started. I just started using a barefoot style shoes and striking with my mid foot and was able to run much faster than usual. I kept an 8 MPH pace (I'm not a fast runner) and pushed myself for those last 5 minutes (out of 20) to stay there. Unfortunately, I could see the guy next to me running at 9 MPH and going up to 10 MPH in the end and I knew I was getting my ass handed to me.

Luckily, the organizers use some sort of weird points system and that still got me to 1st place on my wave, 19 overall (out of 68 participants). I recommend anyone that is considering a triathlon to try out an indoor one. Its a great introduction to the sport and there are individuals of all levels.

Newbie triathlete here. I've got my first tri coming up next weekend -- [UBC Tri](http://www.rec.ubc.ca/events/triathlon/). I'm both excited and nervous as I've been training for this event since the fall. 

I have no idea what to expect, as I've never been to a tri event or even seen how the transitions work. The swim will take place in a pool. My main question is about clothing. I have my bike shorts, and I have a pair of jammers. Do I wear the jammers during the swim, and use those to bike and run in as well? Or do I slip my bike shorts on top of the jammers?   

Or do I fork out money I don't have to get a pair of tri shorts? Do the tri shorts have the padding for your perineum? Do you use them for races only? 

I'm happy with my bike set up - 2007 Specialized Roubaix Comp. I've got the fit to a place that works well for me. The clip in pedals + shoes that I got a few weeks ago have been awesome. The bike ride is 11K - should I carry a spare tube, pump, and tire levers? Or do I save the weight? (Bike is light enough as is, imo). 

I'm confident with the bike and run. I'm nervous about the swim as it's my weakest link.

I am having quite the mixture of emotions as I reflect back on today’s triathlon.

I am now a triathlon finisher! I set a PR for a sprint course.

Ultimately, there were elements of victory just lining up for the start. 

On 4/23/13 I decided that I was fed up with being fat, tired of being depressed from lack of exercise, and generally unhappy with the reflection in the mirror. I am 6’3” and I started at 277 pounds. (Why, Skot123, these are awfully specific dates and numbers… how can you be so sure? Well, me, thank you for asking. In a fit of frustration on 4/23 I started writing my weekly weight on the bathroom mirror, I also started putting an X next to the week for every workout.)

The weight has been coming off steadily. Today I tipped the scales at 244. (When I lose 5 more pounds, I will transition from obese to overweight on my continuing journey towards health.)

Last month I had a pinched nerve in my neck that sidelined me for 10 days. (I’ve had things that I’ve called a pinched nerve before… but this kicked my butt.) For the past few weeks pain killers, anti-inflammatory medication and ice have been a major part of my daily routine.

Fast forward to today.

I woke up about 5 hours before race start (not intentionally… just too excited to sleep). I forced myself to stay quietly in bed for a couple of more hours and got a few short naps in.

About half hour before my planned wake-up time, I went to the patio with my mp3 player to visualize the day and get ready.

I had my typical breakfast, did a final gear check, loaded up the family/cheering section and got into the van for the ride to the start line.

About 5 minutes later we were at the start line.

I got marked up with my race number and a giant “C”. Put the number on my bike, prepared my transition area, and began the waiting process.

After what seemed like an eternity of waiting the Clydesdale and another age group wave made our way into the starting pen and eventually into the water. 

There were only about 30 people in the start wave (but someone did remark that it was always one of the biggest heats then laughed at their own pun).

On my last swim workout day, I was very sore from my pinched nerve (+ some bonus shoulder pain) so I had stayed out of the water for almost two weeks.

The start was far less chaotic than I had expected. There was a little bumping and jockeying for position… but not bad.

I typically site in every 6 to 9 strokes… but when I saw people swimming so wide and less swimmers than I had expected so I checked a bit more often and was right on target.

By turn one I was in about 3rd place and feeling pretty comfortable. However while turning, the buoy twisted into me and I got a mouth/nose full of water. I continued on (with a little hacking and coughing).

We caught the tail end of the wave in front just before exiting the water. I was in 5th place in my wave and top 1/3rd overall in the swim (6:54)

T1 went relatively smoothly my time was 3:26. I had wanted less than 3 minutes (I am not sure where I went long either) but I was on my bike pretty quickly.

The bike felt pretty good early (in my swim/bike practices it had taken me about 5 min to settle in on the bike).  Within the first 2 minutes of the ride I was in my top chainring and cruising. 

At 12 min into the ride I popped a salt pill.

A few moments after that I heard an ambulance approaching after it passed, I remarked to a fellow rider I hope that wasn’t for anyone on course.

As I started the decent down Duthie hill…I got up to speed, passed a rider then promptly hit my brakes (hard). Car traffic was at a full stop.

I followed the lead of the next rider in front of me and passed the cars on the right hand shoulder.

There were two ambulances on the road and a handful of riders sitting on the guardrail. I had hoped this was just a minor accident. (Apparently, I missed the mangled bike in the guardrail.)

I continued down the hill cruised the next few minutes of flat then started the climb. I’ve ridden this climb several times over the past few weeks and it is a tough one. I’ve timed an arbitrary 3 mile section from the base of the climb to the stop sign at the end. On 6/8 it took me 30 min, last week I did it in 19:50 today I was at 21 min.

By the time I got past the top my water bottle had been dry for a few minutes…but I had an ice cold one waiting for me at the run… so I didn’t stop at the on-course water station.

I had planned on down-shifting and spinning for about ¼ mile to loosen up the legs for the run… but that didn’t happen. I just kept it in a high gear and hammered onward.

I finished the ride section at 57:46 (I was hoping for low 50s or better)… but I kept onward.

T2 felt quicker than it was 1:37… but I thought I was out of there quicker than that.

Then the “run” happened.

Sadly, the emphasis/sarcasm quotes are required.

I felt like crap starting the run (but that came as no surprise, I always feel like crap moving from bike to run for a few minutes).

I pushed forward for a few minutes despite having a cramp in my back between my shoulder blades and another brewing in the quads of both legs.

I popped another salt pill and finished my water bottle (I knew I could refill it at mile 1).

I continued at my slow trodding pace for another few hundred yards then began walking.

I started out counting paces planning on running 100 paces then walking 25.

However, once I had stopped running I couldn’t get going well. 100 paces quickly became 50 then 25 then 10. Then I started picking landmarks “I’ll jog until I get to that shadow across the road” or “I’ll jog until I get to that telephone pole”… and I fell short of each goal.  (Not sure if I was broken physically, mentally, or both…but there was no power coming from the engine room)

I continued this for 4.3 agonizing miles. I don’t know what percentage I walked… but it was way too much. My run time was just over an hour and this put me squarely in last place in the division.

There are a lot of things I need to improve fitness wise and I really need to work on doing regular brick workouts.

During the awards ceremony they announced that rider who had crashed was in critical condition.

I really am facing a myriad of emotions. I am proud that I finished. My transitions and swim were a bit slower than I had hoped for. My bike was several minutes slower than I had hoped… and I really just limped the run to completion.

I am debating on doing the Lake Sammamish Tri next weekend… but I’ll make a final call on that in a couple of days.

I imagine most of my questions will be answered when I get there or through other communication from them, but here are a few specifics I don't think will be.

1. I read the hydration post yesterday and had a question about aid stations.  First, do people stop at these?  I saw several go by and grab a water bottle in the video, but didn't see anyone stop.  I ask because, I'm beyond uncoordinated and am likely to hit someone or wreck myself trying to grab more than just a bottle on the fly. 

2. So, when I take a bottle do I drop one off somewhere or before? If I do, do they provide bottle initially or should I buy a could cheap ones before the races and expect to be out them at race end? 

3. In the transition areas is there an area that I could just hang/stretch for a few minutes between legs of the race.  I'm not racing for a time or anything, I just want to finish and cross this off my ""bucket list"", I try to be competitive in short distances, but long distance is about fun and fitness,  I just don't want to clog anything up in the transition area or get in anyone's way.

I've been doing triathlon for about three years. I'm about to start training for my first full Ironman. 

One of my goals for this season is to own up to my abilities and go for broke, performance-wise. Obviously, training is the most important way to improve, but I think I have a pretty good handle on that - I have a coach, I'm very disciplined, and I love challenging training.

So I thought maybe I'd try to drop a few pounds - five, maybe ten. Clearly, I'm not overweight. But I've always thought I was a little... I dunno... *heavy* for an endurance athlete. I figured being lighter while still being fit and strong could only help, right? So since early January I've really been trying to be more conscientious about my diet. I started logging my calorie intake, trying to make better choices, cutting down on processed food. 

And I have not lost a single pound. Not a single one! I know that I have made mistakes, and that I could definitely be stricter with my diet (even though I feel like it has improved dramatically since starting on this journey). I also know that losing weight when you're not overweight is pretty hard. But... shit, I thought I would have made at least SOME progress. 

So now I'm really frustrated and wondering if all this is even worth the effort. Will dropping 10lbs mean cutting out all treats and goodies and eating only broccoli and chicken breasts? And will those 10lbs even matter? I want every part of my training to go toward making significant improvements. If losing weight is only going to end up saving me a couple seconds per race, I might just throw in the towel.

**TL;DR losing weight when you're not overweight is hard, boo hoo. Is it worth it?**

I've done some googling around, found some online and IRL shirt printers. Now I'd like to present you guys with ""mocks"", not real shirt prints.

* [Blue shirt with white type, for women](http://teespring.com/triathlon-sweater-blue-womens)
* [Blue sweatshirt with white type](http://teespring.com/triathlon-sweater-blue)

**Pricing:** so I've played around with numbers, the above are all mocks from customink on american apparel shirts and champion athletic tee. For about $13, one shirt is printed and it's part of a shipment of about 25. The higher the number, the less it costs to print. The athletic is around $23 for a print in a batch of 25. 

If this sounds appealing, I'd like to start taking an estimates of how much it would be to print. 

Also, tomorrow (monday 10/1), I'll be going to a local shirt screen printer's shop to see how much they print these for as well. Might save on shipping with the local printer.

Having done 2 sprints, and 1 olympic this year, I've decided that I want to up my game next year and do a few sprints, and a HIM.  I constantly am watching Craigslist for bikes in my area out of habit, and I happened upon a local bike for a decent price (I think) that I'm contemplating to my growing (n+1) collection.

I currently have done all of my riding and tri's on a Cannondale System6 Circa 2007 (looks like this: http://www.ibikedb.net/bikes/19811-cannondale-system-6) which I put some basic aero bars on and it's been fine for me.  

So the bike I've came across locally is here:  http://cedarrapids.craigslist.org/bik/3266009250.html and it's within a 5 minute ride to go see, or 2 minutes by car.  The ad says it's a 2009, but looking around the internet, it appears it's actually a 2006.  Is this an upgrade for me?  Should I wait for something newer?  For it's day, this thing was pretty well equipped.

TL;DR - Is this (http://cedarrapids.craigslist.org/bik/3266009250.html) a significant upgrade from this (http://www.ibikedb.net/bikes/19811-cannondale-system-6) for Sprint/Olympic/HIM type events?

- I probably wasted 30 seconds with my show laces in T2. I noticed the guys next to me had elastic shoe laces or something so they just had to pull the strap to tighten. Are these worth getting or are there better shoes for transitions?
- This Tri was my 3rd distance ride on a rode bike. Two things to note: I needed to scout out the damn mountain before the race (I signed up they day before so I had no clue what I was doing). There were times I would try to conserve energy for the next hill when it wasn't necessary. I also have no clue how to
shift properly. Is shifting something I'll just get used to over time or is it worth it to go out with a trainer for a day?

Looking at this one here:

http://trisports.com/2xu-m-compression-trisuit.html

I'm thinking trisuit because I have a hard time finding shorts and a jersey or top that fit proportionally. I'm 6'3'' and weigh in between 180-185 lbs. My problem is that I can't find a jersey that is both snug enough but also long enough to cover my torso. My thought is that if I get a 1 piece suit I won't have to worry about my jersey riding up in the back especially during the bike portion of a race and in the front during the run. I also don't want a loose suit to create more drag during the swim.

Anyone have experience with one or both types of either kit?

Also, do the benefits of an advertised 'compression' suit merit the $200 price tag?",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,Tri-Flair,True,t3_v1tau,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/v1tau/trisuit_vs_shorts_and_singlet/,

Note: big downside is the seat post doesn't stay up. I have to hop off every 20-30 minutes to correct it. The bike shop has a ""ticket"" open with Trek to figure it out.

UPDATE: Discovered the cause of the seat post problem. The bike has a wedge you screw down that secures the seat post to the seat tube, and on the larger frames (I have an XL frame), the wedge was found to be too small.

Pre-race stuff. 

I'm a middle aged dude that was mildly active in my youth, but not much since. My background is as a mediocre competitive swimmer-but never really been much of a biker/runner. In fact, I hated running. To tell the truth, I still hate it. Despite this, about nine months ago I suffered from horrid swimmers ear, and had to stop swimming. Unwilling to stop my recent rekindling of physical activity, I started running with a typical couch to 5k program. In November of 2011, our community center did an indoor tri-which I did. I used the indoor bikes to train, and finished in the middle of the pack. I had fun, and along the way I learned that training for a triathlon reduced overall injuries along with enough variety to keep things interesting. 

So for the past 7 months since, I've nightly been swimming 1 to 1.5 miles, biking 10-20, or running 3-4 miles. It's not much, but this in combination with a vegan diet has made me lose 35 pounds. So, yay me, right? 

The Race: This is the Silverback Lawrence Triathlon, which I did the Sprint distance. This was offered free for any of the folks that were participants of the previously cancelled KC Tri-which I took advantage of.  Overall, I think there were roughly 100 participants, so pretty small. Far smaller than the KC tri, that's for sure. 

The night before, I packed my car up and made sure my back was ready to go. I set my alarm for 4:30 in the morning ,remembering what a cluster even getting a spot on the bike racks was in the KC Tri. As luck would have it, due to my own stupidity my alarm didn't go off. I awoke at 6:10, with just over an hour to get from the Kansas City suburbs to the the Lawrence area. Fifty minutes later, cursing and swearing the whole way, I pulled in and was able to get my bike racked with 5 minutes to spare. No coffee and no breakfast. I waited for the swim start by having a Gu packet and hoping this was enough. 

The Swim: The swim was easy. Never really done the open water swim thing, and this didn't strike as too different. The water was green, and my hands were  blur of green murk. I think I need to work on my sighting stroke. Combining a head lift every 12 strokes or so wasn't working for me-so I just switched to a breast stroke to sight instead. I finished roughly second in my age group. Checking the results afterwords, my swim was 10th overall. Sweet!  

T1: Three minutes to finish. Put on socks, shirt, shoes just took more time than it should have. I found myself jealous of the bucket bringers for having someplace to sit. Finishing a minute or two faster than most other swimmers means nothing if I just waste it in transition. Next time: have a trisuit, consider going sockless. 

Bike: We all come to this sport with a specialty in at least one sport, right? Me, it was swimming. Let me say that swimming is the worst sport to have a specialty in from a morale perspective. Most likely, you don't see the people you pass. Thus begins my tale of woe. I spent most of the bike portion watching folks pass me. I consoled myself by looking at their bikes and saying 

""Well, it's a tri bike.""
""Well, that's a carbon frame roadie."" 
""Oh, I do like those Cannondale Slice machines"" 
""Say, you don't see very many Quintano Roos around"" 

Thus, my internal dialogue. Right about the time I had decided ""I guess you can buy speed"", I was passed by a hybrid mountain bike. Crap. I think that's about the time the wind just left me. I pushed through, thankful that the final mile or three was largely downhill. 
I finished my bike just shy of a 16mph average. 

T2: One minute and change. This was one far easier-just throw off the shoes and put on the running shoes. Done!

The Run: The run of suck. My legs were simply non-functional. I had not really trained bricks and it showed. I ran for about 3/4 of a mile, and I simply could not keep moving. All that confidence I'd had in my late night runs was just gone. The legs weren't there. I stopped to walk a total of 5 times, and managed to finish in just over 40 minutes. Awful. I'll be the first to say I'm not a runner. I've not run a 5k for a time, but I think if I pushed myself I would be at 28ish minutes. Thirty, tops. But here, I was just done. 

So, yeah. I finished. I elated to have finished, but disappointed I could have been mentally stronger. In the end, I think my mistake was not doing my bricks. I wish I was faster on the run and swim, but that just doesn't happen without more work.

I am bad at using my legs when I swim, but I figured that can be beneficial in the long run. I aim to finish ~50 mins, pretty relaxed. 

I have biked a few years, and done some bike races in the past. So this is my strongest segment. I will aim to do about 30km/t on average, depending on wind. However this will probably cost a lot of effort and energy...

The running part is my main weakness. I ran a half marathon terrain race a few weeks ago at 1:58, but that should go faster on concrete. 

My main question is when and where to spend my energy. Should I hold back on the cycling part even though that is my strongest segment, or should I just ease off at the end (and if, at what km?) before the jog? Also should I go up to normal run-pace after a few hundred meters, or should I increase the speed very slowly (same goes for the cycling part)?

I raced a 70.3 last week. It was the first time I'd done this race with my HRM. When I set off on the bike, my HR was about 154 (~80%). And it stayed there - through the bike the only time I dipped below 75% was freewheeling on some of the bigger downhills. The rest of the time my effort was solidly 142 - 160 (75-80%+). For the 70.3, that was fine, in fact I was happy with the effort. I should say as well it was a hilly course - some big rollers for the first 60km and then lots of steep climbing at the end.

I'm racing Lake Placid next month though, and this has given me cause for concern. I raced a 140.6 last year on a very flat course (the bike was on an F1 race track with only a couple of tiny hills) and I found it very easy to pace myself. For the first 25%, I stayed firmly in zone 1 (120-130 / 65%+), then for the next 50% I let my effort drift upwards (130-145% / 70-75%), and then I powered on the last 25% where I was comfortable with what I had left to do.

I think it's going to be a lot harder to pace myself at LP. How do you calm yourself / your heart rate down coming out of T1? How do you keep your HR down despite tacking climbs and hills, while dealing with the stress of the race conditions?

I don't have specific tri clothing, am I going to be the odd one out if I turn up in shorts &amp; a t-shirt?

I have a pretty nice road bike that I've frequently ridden more than 100 miles on, but it's not a TT or Tri bike, again, will I stick out like a sore thumb?

At an event like this am I likely to find other people of my fitness level (bit chubby, beginner), or are most people there likely to be pretty serious athletes?

Any who, I've been thinking about this for a few weeks and think it will be good. Goal is to lose some lbs, and mark something off my bucket list.  Now, I know how to ride a bike, and I know how to swim, although I am not a strong swimmer by any means. I currently run ~6 miles every other day (sometimes more, and sometimes less pending how good i'm feeling) while on the treadmill at the gym. Now don't interpret this as ""I'm a runner"" because I would not classify myself as such, more of ""Every other morning I go to the gym, get on the treadmill, set it to 6mph and awkwardly trundle along till I can't breath, slow down, then repeat."" I would describe my body type as... previously fat, now thick excess skin (use to be 340 ish)

So that being said, I'm looking for help in the training section of this.  The triathlon I'm thinking about entering is a sprint, 20 laps, 15 mile bike, and a 5k run.  I've found a few links for suggestions on training, however I have not found a common suggestion on what to do (with the exception of not increasing more than 5% every week).

Could someone give me a general outline of how these different factors effect you during swimming? They seem obvious enough but i just want to make sure i haven't completely lost the meaning of something as i'm new to the sport.

Also why are wet-suits worn? Is it to keep every one on a somewhat level playing field? Or is it just how its done?

onto the race. I picked up a bus from the intermediate school at 5:30 taking us to t1 since parking was limited at the lake. we left at around 5:40 at the latest but somehow managed to get lost on the way and did not arrive at t1 until 6:45 which was when the transition area closed to the athletes. fortunately they kept t1 open and delayed the start of the race so that we could adequately prepare.  toilets where limited so the lines for the bathroom were pretty long but thus is at every race.  
swim was good. good course. cold water. good starts and finish. t1 was solid.
bike course was bumpy. there were holes at many parts of the course. the turns were sharp and unmarked. lots of accidents from people taking turns way to fast and a lot of gravel or the turns.  aid stations were good quality tho. bike into t2 was clean very nice.
run course was hilly. volunteers were on top of the roadway which was very helpful. aid stations every mile or so. great volunteers there as well, no shortage of supplies always ready. it was a rough run tho very hilly
some other people that i talked to said that for an ironman event it was sub par and that they were debating coming back next year but would consider it since it is only the second year. since the swim was cancelled last year it could even be considered the first year for the full event.

Background story:

Windy ass day today mixed with deciding to sleep in after a long night (I'm actually a band director, so had to be at the football game last night , home late) caused me to skip my normal group ride this morning. No problem, I know a nice secluded hilly area and went solo to get some laps in.

I've only been into this for 2 months, and the group has taught me A LOT. However , I hadn't experienced this type of wind before. Needless to say, I came around a hill into a crosswind that perfectly timed it's gust and pushed my back wheel. I panicked and experienced my first wreck, nothing serious, lots of road rash, bent handle bar. I already took he bike yo the shop, it's ok now. Going to have a nasty bruise on my hip.

Bike was ok to ride, so I decide to come home. As I'm about to turn into my neighborhood (I signaled and followed the rules) a car stays in my lane, whips around me, runs me off the road over the curb. Because I was mad at myself over the wreck...I proceed to chase the guy down, only to find out he lives 2 doors down. I confront him, old ass guy, and he just starts yelling at me that he just must not have seen me...but then changes his tune and starts yelling at me to get my ass off the road, and that ""the roads are for the god damn cars"". I wanted to do mean things....but left with his cursing.

Can I do anything legally to him? No cars but him around so no witnesses. 

Should I just let it go? I know I was probably just overly angry due to the earlier wreck.

If nothing else, thanks for letting me vent. I don't think I'll be doing my long run tomorrow...

I completed the triathlon with a total time of 1 hour and 34 minutes.

0.5 mile swim - 21:55 min

12 mile bike - 39:09 min

5k run - 29:21 min

http://i.imgur.com/jZuOc.jpg

I didn't feel any bonking or crashes during the entire race from not having carbs in my system. It was a 6:00 pm event. Aside from the breakfast, I snacked on peanut butter and nuts a few hours prior, and just water up to the race. After the swim, I ate the peanut butter packet before starting on the bike since I know I tend to get hungry mid-way through during practices. The only difficulty I had was with the swim, but not due to keto; more due to the fact that I kept getting lost and going off course, then having to play catch up with the pack :p

Overall, it was a great experience. I felt that being in ketosis allowed me to keep a constant pace that I felt I could go forever in during all three events. My muscles also never felt the shock of being depleted of glycogen and bonking. The downside is that I didn't feel like I had explosive energy to use, but it was only noticeable on the few big hills during the bike. 

My next goal is to start training for an olympic distance tri. Are there any experienced triathletes that are also on a low-carbohydrate diet throughout training/racing? If so, do you have any advice on increasing distance/pace? I may switch over to CKD or TKD if necessary.",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_ybstp,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/ybstp/completed_my_first_sprint_triathlon_today_while/,

I'm going to be briefly preface with a bit of background that you can probably skip over if you're so inclined.  I'm seventeen year old male who has been doing triathlons for going on four years now.  I've competed in numerous sprints and two olympics.  I'm a junior in high school, next year's indoor track captain, I currently run a 55 second four hundred, and have been so focused on that that I believe my preparation for the Quassy Ct, HIM in four weeks, has fallen by the wayside.

My question is, should I not bother with the HIM?  I have logged one 15 mile run but feel that the run should be the easiest part (relatively), I've gone on a handful of 2 hour indoor bikerides (maybe 1 a week) and swimming I get in the pool occasionally and pound out a mile and a half.  My question is should I still do it?

**TL;DR** Given my minimal training but high(ish) fitness should I compete in a HIM in one month?

If yes any advice on how to take the next four weeks in terms of training? Can I ramp it up after my last track meet tuesday and go hard for a week followed by a sharp decline?

Just wondering what kind of training (hours/week, distances, volume, etc.) any of you have done. Currently we're pretty comparable, generally winning our age group or placing top 3 at sprints and olympics, or if we're racing a collegiate event, top 10 (we're 19 and 20, respectively). I come from a cross country background, so it's very hard for me to accept that I can actually improve without running EVERY day. Naturally we'd like to be at Kona 2012, but realistically 2013 or 2014 would be acceptable. 



For reference, last season I was training about 25 hours/week at my peak, Running every day with alternating runs/swims as doubles, and lifting weights 3x week.

However, now that I'm moving onto Tris I think it's about time I got serious and got myself a bike so I can get training!

I've never done a tri before, but I plan on getting into them and I will do at least a 70.3 next year and possibly a full IM if I feel up to it.

I do want to do well in the triathlons and so I do want to buy a decent bike from the off as I'm seeing it more as an investment in myself rather than just buying an expensive gadget or piece of kit.

Anyway i'll get to the point

1) How much difference will it really make having a Tri bike instead of a Road bike or an adapted Road bike? What sort of distance would it start making a significant difference, taking into account the fact I will do at least a 70.3 next year. Can a converted road bike ever be close to competing with a proper tri bike. Could you still do things like coast to coast and other biking events on a tri bike or would hills kill you?

2) What key things should I be looking for in either a Road or Tri bike? Types of breaks/gears/saddle/peddles etc? I have a general idea but i dont really know specifics and what would actually be a requirement and what is just a gucci piece of kit people like to have if they have the money.

3) Last Season models/ last seasons hire bikes, would they just be advertised on the manufacturers/hire companies websites or is there a better way to find these? For hire bikes will they be serviced and in a good condition when they sell them, does anyone have one?

4) Bike recommendations for someone in my position, should I go for Road/Tri and can anyone recommend (or even sell) one. My initial thought was to spend about £500-600 and aim to get all my tri gear for less than a total of £1000. However, as i already have more running gear than anyone could really need and that i dont intend on buying another bike for a long long time after this (it wont be a case of buy a cheap bike now and a newer bike next year) then i could go up to that £1000 for just the bike (and sell my body for the rest).

Basically any information or advice you can throw in my direction would be greatly appreciated, especially if it is to do with bikes ",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_jh9oi,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/jh9oi/first_bike_roadtri_recommendations_uk/,

**TL;DR** I have no Tri experience and i'm thinking of entering an Ironman 70.3 or 140.6 in ~June 2012. I am a decent runner (up to about 10 miles - even in military boots and soaking wet full combats) and have a good level of all round fitness as i've been applying to join the Royal Marines Commandos. However, I do not swim or cycle much at the moment and i would probably need coaching on my front crawl technique. Is this a good idea or should i aim for something much smaller in the time-scale i have.

**Long Version**
I applied to become an officer in the Royal Marines, but to cut a long story short I didn't make the final cut despite completing the application process including all the physical aspects.

I have a full year in which to apply again as they only take in a small amount of officers once a year (September). I was thinking of a new challenge to aim for and as inspiration to keep my fitness improving.

My running is decent although I'm not currently running more than about 8-10 miles at a time, but I have done some longer distance adventure races such as Tough Guy, Hell Runner. I also did the Royal Marines potential officers course which consists of a 3.5 hour Assault Course and 2 hours Endurance Course in full (soaking wet) combats and heavy military boots.

The problem I have is the Swimming as I'm pretty much useless at front crawl (although I can do it), that and the fact I do not have a bike and so do very little cycling although with my fitness i do believe i would get up to speed in this aspect fairly rapidly.

Do you guys think it would be possible to get up to IM 140.6 standard (or a 70.3) in my swimming and cycling in the time-scale I have (Race is June/July 2012). I have no previous Tri experience, but I would obviously enter a few smaller Tris to get to grips with the transitions and nature of the events.

How do you guys think i should attack this challenge (if it's possible)and what i should focus on?

I do not consider myself an athlete by any stretch of the imagination but was introduced to the idea last summer by my in-laws wanting to make a family event out of it.

I had three goals:

* to simply finish the race
* to not be in last place
* to not walk at all during the run portion

It took me 1:56:30, which was around my expected time of ""just under two hours"" but I would've been really happy at 1:45:00. I have a swimming past so I was placed with more competitive triathletes at the start of the race who I kept up with in the pool but who totally schooled me in the other events.

I achieved my goal of not walking during the run portion, which I feel very proud about. I also didn't come in last place!

I feel my bike sucked, though. Granted, I underestimated the difficulty of it and didn't focus as much on biking as I did on running in my training. My brothers finished the race before I even started and gave me the feedback that it looked like my seat was too low (I didn't feel like it was) and that I was pedaling quite fast without much speed. I was in a relatively low gear -- mid-way on the left (about 5?) and 3 on the right -- but thought this was the way to go?

For months, CGI racing has been very communicative through weekly emails regarding instructions for packet pick-up, athlete guides, rules overviews, and even how to find your pictures after the race.  These emails plus their fairly active facebook page, where they were very quick to answer questions and address concerns, earned them an A+ for pre-race preparation.  Each athlete really shouldn't have any lingering questions about rules/start times/race day directives going into race morning.

And the packet pickup was also very well organized, with more lines than were necessary to get people in and out of the expo area in 5 minutes if they felt the need.  But hopefully people got a chance to hang around, because the expo area had some great shops set up and the pre-race meeting offered a good chance to hear about the course and ask any questions one might have (as it seems to be a popular first-timer race).

**Race Day**

*Swim*

There was ample opportunity to warm up for the very calm lake swim.  And warm up is the right word here because the water was 86 degrees!  This was the first tri swim where I honestly thought the water was uncomfortably hot, but I got used to it after a 20 minute swim in the designated warm up area, which was separate from the race course.   This is important to note, as it allowed competitors to warm up tight up until their wave had to get to the starting line.  This was probably great for the late starters.

The swim course was put together as well as it could be too.  There must have been buoys every 50m along the 550m course, which made it incredibly easy to hold a good line.  And before the start, they made multiple announcements regarding how to set yourself up in the swim start, warning slower swimmers not to get up in front and inviting the sprinters to get up on the line.  Still, not everyone listened, because I, as an average swimmer found myself buzzing by/through quite a few slower guys who still thought it was a good idea to line up front and center.  This is the norm though, and I think it was better here than at the other 2 sprints I have raced.

The exit was big and easy to navigate, but T1 was looong, with even the elites taking 1.5 minutes to get from the water to the bike course.  A lot of that had to do with the 150m you have to run with your bike to get to the mounting area.  But with that being said, 
I have no complaints about it as it was spaciously laid out and gave me plenty of room to run around slower T1ers.

*Bike*

The course was laid out mostly within the park that hosted the event, so there was rarely even an opportunity to see a car passing in the opposite direction.  It was also very well directed, with flagged volunteers at each turn directing racers which way to go.

Overall, this was a very flat course that rode along very smooth roads.  It was on the short-side of sprint bike legs at 10.1 miles, so this really seemed to fly by.  Through most of the 10 miles it got pretty lonely, but once you returned back to the race area the crowd was really great, lining up for the whole 50m chute that led up to the bike dismount area.  I should note that there were no bike aid stations, which should not come as a surprise for a 10.1 mile bike ride.  

This is also a good spot to call out the fantastic volunteers manning the transition zones.  They were extremely supportive whether you were out there for 1 or 3 hours, and they really never let their energy slip.  They helped make the race what it was.  So, thank you if any of you are out there.

*Run*

The entire 5k run was contained within the park on paved trails, so it was really great, offing no opportunity for wrong turns or confusion.  Like the bike course, this was a very flat trip.  And also like the bike course, a large portion of it was shaded.  This was very welcomed on this rather hot day.  

At the turnaround point, there were loads of volunteers with water, cold towels, and supportive cheers.  There was even a mister set up for anyone who want a quick shot of cool water (I did).  There were also an aid station set up mid way back, which offered water to those going in either direction.

The finish was put together like a little Ironman closing.  There was a chute set up with a long red carpet surrounded by cheering supported on either side, leading up to an arc over the finish line that you crossed as the announcer called out your name and gave his congratulations.  And right after the line was a very welcomed misting tent for the racers.  This felt great after such a hot run.  They really had all of their bases covered in preparation for a mid heat-wave race.

**Post-Race**

The food was great, with fruit, pasta, potato salad, yogurt, pretzels, recovery milk, coconut water... and other things I am forgetting I'm sure.  Lets just say they were well stocked.

The race results came up wonky for a lot of people, as they seemed to be having internet issues, so the very high tech tent with the touch screen computers was not being put to great use for a while.  this also delayed the awards ceremony from 10:30 to about 11:30.  This was pretty much the only hiccup in the entire event, and it led to most people clearing out by the time anybody got up to the podiums, but they ended up getting everything right in the end.  And to kill time they came out with boxes of hats and water bottles that they threw out to the crowd that was hanging around.  So they did what they could with the hand they were dealt I'd say.

**My race**

Here's the part you can skip!

* Swim - 550m, 0:10:16, 1:52/100m - This was not my best work, but the heat seemed to have an effect on my breathing.  I don't know why, but I really didn't hit my stride 'til the 350m marker, then I picked up the pace greatly though the close.  I missed my goal by a lot.. but it seems that a lot of people did so I am trying not to be too down on this time.  I came out in the middle of the 2nd big group I'd guess.  There were the lightning fast guys, the small first chase group, then my larger group.  I got to the front of this group in the last 100m so I could have a slightly less crowded T1.  And it was pretty empty still when I got in there.

* T1 - 2:16 - Trust me, for this course I was very pleased with this.  It was probably a slightly above average transition for the race as a whole.  I have normal cycling shoes so I had to strap in before heading out, but besides that I was as quick as I thought I could be.

* Bike - 10.1 mi, 0:25:42, 23.6 mph - I don't have a tri-bike yet so I was very happy with this time.  It was a lonely ride after I passed most of the super swimmers from my group, because the only group left in front of me were the Elites and I didn't get too see many of them on the course with their 5 minute head start!   I am using an entry level bike with upgraded wheels/tires and aero-bars with a forward facing seatpost.  I can get pretty flat with this set up.  Adding in my aero bottle and areo helmet, I think I'm almost at the limit of what I can do with this bike as far as aerodynamics are concerned.  I may get a disc cover for my back wheel before my next Half-Ironman in Sept, but then I think I'm out of things to upgrade! 

* T2 - 1:07 - Again, it's a long run in transition and I don't have tri-shoes for my bike, so I was about as quick as I could be here.  I took down a gel right at the end of the bike leg so I took a quick swig of Gatorade here to help wash it down.  I think it was worth the 2 seconds.

* Run - 5k, 0:20:24, 6:34 per mile - Again I missed my goal, but the heat was pretty rough, so I'm altogether pleased with this effort.  The shade was great and the cold towels really gave me a boost at the halfway point that I hit at about 10:15 into the run.  I passed the last guy left in my AG with about 3/4 of a mile to go.  I picked up the pace a lot to get around him, probably getting down close to 6 min per mile.  I did this strategically though, not stupidly I think, haha.  I didn't want him to think he had any reason to try to keep up with me, so I went by at top speed and kept it up until we hit a windy section where he must have lost sight of me.  He tried to hold my pace for a few seconds once he saw it was between us for the group win, but he couldn't hold it for long.  After I got out in front and realized that he gave up the chase I dropped back down to something near 6:35 per mile.

* Overall - 0:59:46 - This hit my goal of under an hour and was good enough for an age group win, which was my first!  They had some really cool medals for the winners, and it will look quite nice nest to all of my other finisher medals, haha.  It was also the NJ State Championship which I was not eligible for as an out-of-stater (so the state 1st place passed down to the first guy in my group from NJ), but my girlfriend came in 3rd for the state competition in her age group so overall it was a good day!

**Training**

 Like I mentioned, I have a have a Half Ironman coming up in September, but my main focus has been marathon training for my first full in November where I hope to qualify for Boston (my 16 mile long-run sunday was my farthest yet).  So this race was more for the sake of getting a hard workout in and getting the competitive juices flowing!  

At this point in my season I am running between 33-45 miles per week with a 10-16 mile long run.  I am biking 100 or less miles per week with a 40-50 mile long ride (this leg has taken the biggest hit to make way for my marathon training) and I am swimming 2 times per week averaging about 2000m per workout.  I used to swim 3 times per week, but I really want that BQ in November.

I plan on stepping it up to a full Iron in 2014, but I don't want to do it until I am confident that I can *race* the full course, so I'm taking it small to medium steps at a time. This is my first full season doing any races, as last summer I got introduced to the sports through 5ks and a sprint-tri.  I didn't start cold though, as I come from an ice-hockey heavy background.  I really love the community so far and I love seeing each workout turn into a faster time every time I've hit a course so far.  

**TL:DnR-** Hot, well organized swim in calm waters.  Flat fast bike.  Flat shaded run.  Awesome volunteers. Awesome race.  Podiums are a fun bonus!  If you are iffy, do this race.  It's great for vets and first-timers alike.

I'm also not a fan of the inability to use my tops when climbing up hills but I'll just have to adapt and pick and choose when I clip on the bars. I know the whole ""you need a forward seat post and blah blah"" but I'm not looking to convert my road bike to a tri-bike, just looking to gain 4-5km/h on the flat parts.

1373847548.0,8,self.triathlon,1ib1kb,Mossman Sprint race report,10,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1ib1kb/mossman_sprint_race_report/,"So this was my second triathlon, and the first I finished. I had entered one on June 2nd but crashed out with a hospital visit on the bike leg. There were 550 starters and around 25-30ish, I would say, in my age group of U19 male.

It was an 800m point-to-point swim course down the beach. Water temperature was 74 degrees. Very murky because it's the Long Island sound. It was also very misty to the point where you had around 300-400m visibility in the air. The sun was just a flat yellow disk in the sky. No glare or shadows cast whatsoever. The water was like glass until we started. It was a waters edge start and right off the bat I knew I was getting dropped like a rock by the good swimmers. I don't wear a wetsuit which also makes it a little harder. I swam it in a 12:34 which I found very disappointing. I'm on the high school swim team, but I'm a sprinter and fly specialist, so I wasn't swimming to my strengths. I need to log way more yards in the local YMCA pool before my next one.

T1 was a blunder. I attempted a flying mount on my bike, but I have road shoes and not tri-specific. I actually entered and exited transition with the fastest time of the day of all racers. That, however, didn't matter because 200 yards later I had to stop and put on my shoes for real because I couldn't get my feet in.

The bike course was 2 loops. VERY flat for most of it with 2 small hills about midway. I thought since it was a beachside race that there would be a strong wind, but luckily there wasn't a single gust during the race, (though it started picking up later, after I had finished and the mist burned off). I'm a kid with an athletic build, but I carry most of my muscle mass in my legs, and my upper body is, well...kind of lacking. But this enabled me to punch it up the two hills. The first was maybe 100m long but had a grade close to if not more than 15%. The second was about 1k long with closer to a 6-7% grade. This was where I made the biggest gains on each lap. I was able to punch up both of these climbs and drop some the racers I'd been with since T1.
I completed the bike with and avg speed of 21.3 mph. So while it's not spectacular, I felt like I could've done a 40k at that pace. ONe complaint was that very few people understood the ""stay right unless passing"" rule. I was often left of the double yellow line because they rode in packs as if they were in a gran fondo. It frustrated me to no end.

T2 was unremarkable. Easy transition. Quick. No blunders. No traffic.

Aaaaand the run leg. My first reaction out of T2 was, ""SHITSHITSHITSHIT!!!"" I really struggled mightily on the run. I have had lots of mechanical problems and bad luck regarding my bike during training, so I didn't even do a brick session in training. Goddamn is running off the bike hard. I ran around a 22 min 5k. And that was the mentally hardest point of the race. I come from a running background mostly. I've got a 36:06 10k PR and a 17:37 5k PR and a 1:43:52 HM PR, so you might be able to understand why I wanted to cry when my legs wouldn't work the way I'm used to them working. I had to fight my brain to keep running when I felt like I wasn't going any faster than walking pace. 7 people passed me during the run. At 2.5k, a godsend came to me. MY LEGS STARTED COMING BACK! I was able to slowly accelerate over the next 500m until I felt I could go no faster without blowing up. I ran close to a 6:15/mile the last 2k.

I finished in 1:12:04 which earned me 2nd place in my age group and 63rd out of 550 overall.

I learned a few important things today though. First off, NEVER, EVER forget bodyglide. I learned that the hard way with places that should never chafe taking a hit. Second, I learned that I need to sight better during the swim. I probably lost 30-40 seconds in the swim because I consistently deviated from the ideal route. Third, I think I should rent or purchase a wetsuit for my next event because it is Olympic distance and being a sprint swimmer, I need all the distance help I can get. Fourth, don't rush transition if it means I'll just end up stopping 10 seconds later to fix what shouldve been done right. Tri-specific shoes would help with this. Lastly, and most important, BRICKS. I need to do them a lot. I struggled off the bike and need to become accustomed to the feeling in my legs so I can run strong.

TL;DR I had a strong showing and learned valuable lessons for my next events. Great day overall",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_1ib1kb,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1ib1kb/mossman_sprint_race_report/,
1373361170.0,7,self.triathlon,1hxbkm,Ironman Haugesund race recap - first IM,11,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1hxbkm/ironman_haugesund_race_recap_first_im/,"Event link: http://ironmanhaugesund.com/ 

Pre-Race
I had never done any serious triathlons prior to this event and I was very excited. After a 8 hour drive we finally reached Haugesund late Friday. Fantastic scenery along the way and around the city made us looking forward to the cycling stage. We spent most of the day before the race to drive trough most of the cycling course. It was a lot more sharp turns than what I had expected, and we carefully took mental notes of larger potholes. We rigged all our gear at the Transit area and took pictures of where our cycle stand was and how it looked when we entered T1 from the swim etc. It was nice to have a quick look at this before bed later. 

Race-day
Swim
I had only swam about 5 times in 2013, two of which was more than 1000m. But the two longer sessions had made me pretty relaxed about it. I figured I would try to save energy and complete around ~50 mins. I was pretty shocked how hectic the swim was. People over and under you for almost 1000m before it loosened up. Last 900m I just focused on maintaining a good rhythm and tried to swim in a straight line. Clocked in at 42 mins, so well ahead of schedule - and heart rate at 130ish, so I felt really ready for the next stage. 

T1
I was not sure what to wear as it was sort of cold (12C), but it was supposed to be warmer later on. I started taking on sleeves, but the moist skin made it hard, so I ditched them. I just putted on some gloves, forced me to take an energy bar while putting on the shoes, helmet and goggles. A poor T1 time at 8:31 (mostly due to having issues with getting wet-suit off and deciding what to ride in...)

Bike
This was by far my strongest stage as I have done different long distance MTB-races before. Once allowed to jump on the bike I slipped on the pedals and fell on the seat, pushing the seat-post down about 6-7cm. This was really annoying and messed up my sitting-position completely. I had to stand and paddle for about 30-40% of the 90km stage which made my legs pretty stiff. I did not have any unbrako/allen key, nor was it any service stations. Scott's new seatpost system is horribly bad, I did complain to them prior to the race, but they assured me everything would be ok... Turns out I need carbon paste.. Nevertheless I finished the bike ride at 2:51. 

T2: This one was done a lot quicker. It was nice and sunny so I only needed a cap and my run belt (with gels). 3~4 mins total, I downed a bottle of energy drink which took some time. 

The Run
I had one goal - NO WALKING. I had only ran 21km once before this year at 1:57, and I knew that it would hurt the most from 14km and out. The first few km's was hard, and I struggled to get in a good rhythm. But from the 3k mark I felt pretty good. The legs felt nice despite all the standing paddling and awkward sitting position on the bike. And at 8k I felt I could go faster but I forced my self to continue at the same pace and rather save the energy and push later. Man was I glad I held back. After 13k I really started to feel it, and after 15k I felt I had no energy left. I had saved one last high energy gel which I intended to take at 18k mark, but took it now instead. I made almost an instant effect and from 16-20k was pretty nice. Last 1k was full of emotions as the 30 000 people cheering me on to the finish and I saw I just made it below my 6 hour goal - 5:57. (run time was 2:11) 

Tips to other beginners:
Take pictures of transit areas, where your bike is etc. 
Have an eating and drinking plan (gels/bars should be tested).
Have spare tubes (I saw many people with double flat tires)
Have an unbrako/allan key with you
Keep an eye at your HRM, I was never above 165bpm (I think).
Hydrate way more than you think. Dry lips are an indicator you should drink more. 
Don't be embarrassed for strange feelings when you cross the finish-line, I saw many people with cry-eyes :)

I will definitely do it again. With seat-post in proper high I could easily shave 10-15 mins off my time, and with some weight-loss and run-training I could shave a lot of that time as well!

I think this is applicable to the TRI community. When you really dig in and think about what is motivating you to do that extra lap - think about whether you're doing it so the world can see you differently or so you can see the world differently.

newer triathlete here in the market for a wetsuit. 

My friend just emailed me a link to Xterra selling wetsuits for 57% off, which seems like a good deal ($600 down to $255, $400 down to $170). I'm just worried about sizing. 

I'm 5'11, 200 lbs, but nobody believes I'm 200 lbs until I prove it on a scale; I'm just dense and have thick legs.

would it be worth it to order off the Xterra site and save the money, or head down to my local tri-store where you have to make a fitting appointment and their price range is $320+

On a side note, the swim leg is my absolute worse, so I'm taking from the FAQ/talking to others that I should for sure go with the full sleeve?

Swimming has never been an issue with me.  I also grew up playing in Lake Ontario for a good chunk of my childhood.  For some reason, when I get into the water for a tri, I have trouble exhaling when my face is in the water.  I usually have to spend some time just putting my face in the water and practice blowing bubbles until they come easily.  Over the last year or so, this issue has gotten much better...to the point that I didn't need to worry at all about it...until my first race of the season last weekend.  I did a short warm-up trying to get used to the cold water and thought I had the breathing thing under control.  Once my wave went off I was in trouble.  For the majority of the race I had to keep stopping so that I could breathe.  I am typically at the front of my wave...duking it out with one or two other swimmers.  This time around I was towards the back of my wave.  It was such a frustrating race for me!  Has anyone else ever had this issue?  The water was very cold...56 degrees, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it.  At first I thought this whole issue was an anxiety issue...but I don't ever feel nervous about the swim or any part of the race.",,False,self,t5_2qhyh,False,,,True,t3_1e2c1x,http://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1e2c1x/trouble_breathing_in_open_water/,

A couple of friends decided they were going to try out triathlons and convinced me to do a sprint with them. With little real training I managed to finish, walking a lot of the run, but finding the overall experience enjoyable. They then found a training plan for a Half Ironman and convinced me with the amount of between then and the race, Sept-April, we could get in shape and do it. Against my better judgement I decided to do it. It was quite the experience, just in training. I found myself being able to do things I never thought I could. Well race day finally comes around and I have a horrible day. My swim is miserable; goggles leaking, massive headache from how tight I had to make them, couldn't find a rhythm, swallowed a lot of water; needless to say I thought my race was over. I got on the bike and everything turned around; even with a strong headwind to start I was able to achieve under my goal time and start my run feeling good. Then my bad luck came back. My stomach started giving me fits; must have been all the lake water I swallowed. Also couldn't seem to maintain a rhythm or the motivation to keep going. At one point my mindset changed from finishing with a good time to just finishing. I managed to finish just under my original goal time of 7hrs with a 6:50, but I know in my mind that I could have done at least 30 min better than that. During the run I swore I would never do a long distance tri again. About 9 miles into my run my foot really started to feel like something was wrong, but as I sit here 4 days later with my foot finally starting to feel better I am considering doing this again and even going for the full. Our original goal after this was to train for IMTX and I find myself seriously considering it. I am getting getting anxious to train again even knowing how miserable the whole experience was. I have all summer to work on my longer distance running base along with some open water swims before my training plan begins in sept. What I want to know has anyone else done this or am I trying to go to fast? Anyone else feel this way after a miserable race?

However, I'm worried that it might take up too much room in transition. What do you guys think? I've only done one tri before, so I don't know if putting this bucket in the transition area would be poor form or not.
