1350087215.0,118,self.MetaHub,11e5hc,Concerning Adrien Chen's expose of Violentacrez,149,31,326,http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/11e5hc/concerning_adrien_chens_expose_of_violentacrez/,"I don't intend to link to it, since I don't condone Chen's emphasis on VA's identity any more than I condone VA's continual skirting of moral and legal norms, but I thought someone should point out that the actual expose actually makes some worthwhile points about Reddit's dubious relationship to VA. It's unfortunate in the extreme that he chose to bury those more salient points in an article designed to stir up a witch hunt, but it's Gawker, so I expected the priorities to be all wrong.

I've only scanned the article, deliberately passing over any passages that appeared to be about VA, but there are some passages worth pulling:

&gt; A troll exploits social dynamics like computer hackers exploit security loopholes, and Violentacrez calmly exploited the Reddit hive mind's powerful outrage machine and free speech values at the same time.

&gt; It was this pattern, repeated to various degrees dozens of times, that made Violentacrez an unlikely hero to many of the white male geeks who make up Reddit's hard core. They saw Violentacrez as a champion in the fight against the oppressive schoolmarms: ""He upheld a certain amount of freedom for the worst of us to ensure freedom for all of us,"" wrote one user in a post mourning his departure. Fans followed him wherever he went on the site.

&gt; As his fame grew, [VA] began selling T-shirts with an illustration of a zombified version of Reddit's alien logo, designed by a professional illustrator, that he had adopted as Violentacrez's logo. He created a subreddit called Violentacrez, dedicated to news and posts about himself. Last year, the Daily Dot named him the most important Redditor of the year. Violentacrez was the most influential user of one of the most influential websites on the internet.

Chen goes on to talk about VA's relationship to the admins. Personally, I think he paints it as a cosier relationship than VA or the admins themselves had given some of us reason to suppose. Any time I saw them talk about it (which was rare), there seemed to be a strain of antagonism and minimal toleration to both sides. Nevertheless, I agree with the implicit suggestion that the admins opened themselves and the site to charges of complicity by dealing with VA directly.

&gt; Violentacrez's privileged position came from the fact that for years he had helped administrators deal with the massive seedy side of Reddit, acting almost as an unpaid staff member. Reddit administrators essentially handed off the oversight of the site's NSFW side to Violentacrez, according to former Reddit lead programer Chris Slowe (a.k.a. Keysersosa), who worked at Reddit from 2005 to the end of 2010. When Violentacrez first joined the site and started filling it with filth, administrators were wary and they often clashed. But eventually administrators and Violentacrez came to an uneasy truce, according to Slowe. For all his unpleasantness, they realized that Violentacrez was an excellent community moderator and could be counted on to keep the administrators abreast of any illegal content he came across.

&gt; ""Once we came to terms he was actually pretty helpful. He would come to us with things that we hadn't noticed,"" said Slowe. ""At the time there was only four of us working so that was a great resource for us to have.""

&gt; Administrators realized it was easier to outsource the policing of questionable content to Violentacrez than to dirty their hands themselves, or ostracize him and risk even worse things happening without their knowledge. The devil you know. So even as Jailbait flourished and became an ever-more-integral part of Reddit's traffic and culture—in 2008 it won the most votes in a ""subreddit of the year"" poll—administrators looked the other way. ""We just stayed out of there and let him do his thing and we knew at least he was getting rid of a lot of stuff that wasn't particularly legal,"" Slowe said. ""I know I didn't want it to be my job.""",Discussion,False,,t5_2ue57,False,discussion,,True,t3_11e5hc,http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/11e5hc/concerning_adrien_chens_expose_of_violentacrez/,

**EDIT** [A note from chromakode](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/11ybyw/rmodtalks_officialunofficial_status_is_silencing/c6r9gs6?context=3)

This letter came into my modmail recently. As I was in [1] [1] /r/modtalk for over a year before being unaccountably removed last week, I said that I would post it here. If you are a moderator and would like to add your name to this public petition, please say so in the comments.

&gt; To Yishan Wong, CEO of Reddit, and the rest of the administrative staff:

&gt; We the undersigned submit this petition to demand that admission to online spaces where moderators are given special and regular attention from the Reddit administration be equitable.

&gt; Moderators of large communities are being denied access to important and necessary information relevant to their roles as a volunteer moderator on Reddit. These moderators overwhelmingly represent minority groups . They are having the ability to discuss and influence the development of Reddit blocked by other moderators who are not interested in having their dominant position challenged.

&gt; To solve the problem of this blatant marginalization, and, in turn, problems that extend to the Reddit userbase, we must ensure that all voices from Reddit communities, including minority ones, are treated equitably. As a first step, we demand that a minimum subreddit size for participation in [4] [2] /r/modtalk and #modtalk be established and adhered to, regardless of which community asks for entry. An initial recommendation could be having up to 10 representatives from each community of 15 000 or more.

&gt; As Reddit continues to grow, so will the need to address the treatment of minorities on the site. We believe the time to engage is now. We look forward to your response.

&gt; Sincerely,

A few moderators were added at first from the CJ-BJ circuit, myself included, and we made a few posts and tweaked some CSS, not really too sure what to do with the place. Then someone had an idea. A terrible, terrible idea. 

""Let's break the record for most moderators."" - /u/TheGreatBeardofZeus

""pls no"" - /u/A_Cylon_Raider

""let's do it!"" - friggen' everyone else

So we started inviting everyone. I mean everyone. Some of you may even have recieved and accepted invites. The massive amount of moderator invites filled pages, it even drowned out the usual spam I get from other subreddits. We were even linked on a Facebook page with 150,000 fans who were told to spam our modmail with copypasta. That was ""fun."" I'm not sure any of us even knew the record for most moderators, but we were determined to beat it anyway!

Everything was going great until this morning when, to no one's surprise, we noticed /r/sweeden had been banned. 

[Here we see the closest estimate for the final modcount before being banned.](http://i4.minus.com/iRmZdRdELoOSu.png)

So what does this mean for us now? Well, it means that there's 200+ of us trapped on a mod list that we have no way of removing ourselves from.

So we started work on a new style, first we talked to several people and came to the following conclusions: 


- Simplicity seems to be preferred.
- Interface elements should be distinguishable.
- The style should be recognizable.
- Green should stay and green should go (50/50 opinions wise).

Based on that we set out to improve on reddit's default style as basis. To still keep it in the meta sphere while recognizing the dislike for green we opted for a very toned down version of green that you see in the background and on a few other elements. 

What we came up with is a design that clearly divides several interface elements and shouldn't be to to busy to the eyes. Some highlights: 

- Look on your right, up- and downvotes are not a cluttered mess anymore 
- Also on your right, Everything from the subreddit name to the flair editing is now in one box. 
- No more rounded corners, if you find round corners send me a message and I'll kill them. 
- Flairs have been updated to scream a bit less and just present the information 
- Much more.  

Feedback is welcome, we will look at everything but can't promise to implement all feedback.

We've hit 1.5k subscribers in just over three months. It isn't lightning fast growth, but it's sustainable. As we grow, more and more users are contributing, which is great. I'm really excited about this project and I think /r/MetaHub provides a valuable service to those of us who are interested in meta discussion on this website.

Originally, this was my version of /r/aboutreddit, but with a twist - instead of trying to get people to submit meta links &amp; discussion to a brand new subreddit where not many people were around to talk about it, they could find great meta discussions in the various other meta subreddits that already existed, or all across reddit really, and then crosspost them here. We are still gathering the best of them all in one place, but we are also encouraging users to go out and explore the full range of meta subreddits - from /r/newreddits to /r/banneddomains to /r/ideasfortheadmins. Self posts and meta discussion originating from /r/MetaHub itself were not part of the picture.

Recently, a redditor I greatly respect and admire, /u/blackstar9000 (creator of /r/DepthHub, /r/TheoryOfReddit &amp; more) submitted a [self post discussing the recent VA controversy](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/11e5hc/concerning_adrien_chens_expose_of_violentacrez/). I don't know when or why the self-post toggle was turned on, but I'm glad it was, because that was a great thread. One of the comments even got linked to /r/bestof, which [brought us some welcome exposure](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/11evfe/blackstar900_discusses_doxxing_adrian_chen_and/). Bs9k said he submitted it here [because he didn't think it fit quite well into /r/TheoryOfReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/11e5hc/concerning_adrien_chens_expose_of_violentacrez/c6lr6cl?context=1). However, it wasn't within the original bounds of this subreddit, either... so I decided it was time to expand on those bounds.

You may (or may not) have noticed a new rule in the sidebar:

&gt;Discussion threads (self posts) may be submitted here if you think they might violate the rules in an existing meta reddit.

I'm hoping that /r/MetaHub can fill a void: meta discussion that would be *almost perfect* for one of the big meta reddits, but violates some rule or another and therefore would be removed. Things like the discussion of a user being shadowbanned, or a subreddit closing, or an idea about changing the fundamental nature of reddit, or any number of different topics.

I leave you with a reminder: This is a curated space, and the moderators will continue to remove posts they feel are not ""the most interesting meta news &amp; discussion about reddit,"" as they have since this subreddit was created. Yes, we know it's subjective, and yes, we like it that way. If you are worried about an influx of poor-quality posts as a result of this rule, please keep that in mind.

It turns out you can make personalised lists just the same!

After a subreddit address, just add /by_id/ts_submission code,t3_etc

Example: http://www.reddit.com/r/cats/by_id/t3_17ak9v,t3_179dhv

Anyway, it turns it out (thanks to Skuld for notifying me), there's a generator on [Stattit](http://stattit.com/time_machine/).

I'm also one of the many silent mods here on /r/metahub (full disclaimer). I saw that you guys were [somewhere interested](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/yy8jj/r_subredditofday_finding_new_mods_submitters/) in the daily working of /r/SubredditOfTheDay and my recent announcement of hiring new writers from the community.

I wanted to give you guys the heads up directly myself. From the horses mouth as they say.... but first an origin story.

/r/SubredditOfTheDay was run by /u/SROTD himself. But due to being too awesome he had to resign. I have taken control... yodda yodda yodda, new leadership, new direction circlejerk. Anyway, I knew my writing skills were never up to par but I always wanted to contribute. So the next best thing I could do is hire those that could write.

Here is a list of gang... hopefully in cronological order of *hiring*. 

* /u/SROTD (Retired, now only a guest writer)
* /u/syncretic (Retired)
* /u/SidtheMagicLobster (MIA)
* /u/LGBTerffic 
* /u/UkuleleNoGood (Retired)
* /u/BauerUK (Retired)
* Few more that I do not know the name of...
* ---
* /u/jaxspider
* /u/MiraP
* /u/jmk4422 (Retired)
* ---
* /u/PotatoMusicBinge
* /u/RileyXRadio (Retired)
* /u/JMaboard (Retired, now only a guest writer)
* ---
* /u/hippiemachine
* /u/Soupyhands
* /u/SaltyChristian
* /u/Freakazette

Everyone below JMaboard was a recent intern. Hippie, Soupy &amp; Salty and Freakazette are the first batch of new full time writers. I'm so damn proud of them. They are fantastic. I just hope the rest of the interns shine as bright as they do.

##Intern Progression

---

|Interns|First draft written|First post|Present Status|
|---|---|---|---|
|hippieMachine|✓|✓|Full Time SROTD Writer|
|Soupyhands &amp; SaltyChristian |✓|✓|Full Time SROTD Writer|
|Freakazette|✓|✓|Full Time SROTD Writer|

|sad_pants|x|x|Failed to respond|

Hopefully all these interns will flesh out to proper full time writers. My end goal, which I haven't mentioned to anyone yet... but they'll figure it out eventually is... to have enough writers that they are always fully prepared. And to become a guest writer myself.

I've thought about creating a hub for the meta subreddits for several months, but it was a conversation in the #theoryofreddit irc channel today that prompted me to go ahead and get the ball rolling. Honestly I was very surprised the name had not been taken already!

The premise is very simple. Take the format of /r/DepthHub, and extend it to the meta subreddits. Ideally this subreddit will act as a starting point when one is looking for good meta discussion. A lot of my favorite subreddits are listed in the sidebar: /r/TheoryOfReddit, /r/SubredditDrama, /r/IdeasForTheAdmins, /r/NewReddits, /r/ModClub, /r/ModNews, the list goes on. Submissions from any of these subreddits are encouraged, but meta discussion from anywhere on reddit is allowed. 

This subreddit will (hopefully) collect the best meta discussion into one place so you don't have to check 50 different subreddits - although if one were so inclined we do have a nifty [meta multireddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit+TheoryOfIdeas+TheoryOfLinks+TheoryOfModeration+CasualTheoryOfReddit+StatTheoryOfReddit+ShittyTheoryOfReddit+help+bugs+issues+adoptareddit+findareddit+multireddit+newreddits+subredditoftheday+weeklyreddit+csshelp+reddithax+redditdev+modclub+modhelp+modnews+nodtools+pimpmyreddit+redditrequest+modsoftherealms+collegemods+admin+announcements+blog+changelog+ideasfortheadmins+redditoroftheday+dailydot+subredditdrama+theredditor+circlebroke+historyofreddit+artshub+depthhub+methodhub+originalhub+religionhub+truedepthhub) in the sidebar under ""browse all"". I'm hoping to get at least one moderator from [the largest meta subreddits](http://redditdirectory.com/1989/Meta) involved with the project, and I'm trying to get /r/MetaHub plastered onto as many sidebars as possible, so if anyone could help in that regard, it would be greatly appreciated.

The rules &amp; guidelines are simple:

1. Do not submit links to any site other than reddit.
2. Do not link to your own comments or submissions.
3. When linking to discussions, please link directly to the comment branch you want to highlight in the thread, rather than to the original submission.
4. Please add ?context=x to the URL when linking to comment threads, where x is the number of previous comments you want to include.
5. External links may be submitted to the appropriate associated reddit.

In other words, exactly like /r/DepthHub (if it isn't broke, why fix it?).",,False,,t5_2ue57,False,,,True,t3_vpxof,http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/vpxof/welcome_to_rmetahub/,moderator
