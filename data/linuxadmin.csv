Just thanks...,70,9,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/kzd4q/no_question_just_thanks/,"I have submitted a couple questions here over the last couple weeks and wanted to express my thanks. Everybody was extremely helpful and - more importantly - nice.

In working on this project I have done countless searches for basic Linux stuff. Command options, location of certain files, and lots of other little things. That awful cliche of Linux people not being helpful is  still being practiced in the wild. I don't know how many times I would be reading some forum post and saw responses like ""RTFM"" or ""use the manual"". Those tools are great, but they don't answer a lot of questions on **why** you should use that command or option. Anyway, that's not important.

I was not met with that attitude here and wanted to express my thanks.

If you'll indulge me, I would like to brag for one second. Last week I got the following accomplished:

* Install/configure Ubuntu 10.04 Server on a rack-mount HP
* Partition and set up two RAID disks
* Mount those disks on startup
* Remote desktop and SSH into the machine (it's local in my office, but my desk is nicer than standing in front of a noisy rack)
* Password-less SSH to our two remote VPS machines
* Wrote three bash scripts - 2 for MySQL dumps &amp; rsync - 1 to backup those backups to a NAS - all with their own log/error files
* Set up those scripts as a cron jobs that run every night and email me a summary

It took me 55 hours to do all that. I realize most of you guys could do all that in well under a day, but this was my first legitimate use of Linux and the little geek inside me is pretty proud. Of course, I can't really brag to any of my friends, so I am to you.

Thanks again for the answers and more importantly the welcoming attitude.

He wants it to be as secure as possible, and that's my goal too. It's a dedicated Linux server with Linode, so it does not come with any third party software (just the OS). The only services that the server will be running are:

* SSH

* Web Server: Apache + PHP

* Database: MySQL


What steps are required to ensure the best possible security? I have the following already done:

--------------------------

**OS**

* Installed the latest OS updates. These will be updated periodically.
* Disabled any services that are not needed

**Services**

* Created a new user with a strong (random gibberish and long), in its own group, that is able to 'su', disabled root SSH logins and only permitted this user to login via SSH.
* Only allowed the new user's group to SSH.
* Changed SSH port to a random number
* Disabled SSH port v1 (only v2 enabled)
* Disabled SSH password authentication. Public/Private keys are required.
* Increased the SSH logging levels. I may eventually get things to log externally, because I know attackers like to tamper with that sort of thing.
* chroot has been set up for Apache and MySQL

**Security**

* Installed and configured Snort ( http://www.snort.org/ )
* Configured iptables to deny everything, except for the required ports (MySQL can only be accessed locally, so it is blocked to the outside world)
* Installed and configured fail2ban ( http://www.fail2ban.org/ )
* Installed and configured knockd ( http://www.zeroflux.org/projects/knock ) for SSH access
* Installed and configured denyhosts ( http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/ )
* Installed and configured Tripwire ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/ )

**Rootkits / Vulnerabilities**

* Installed and configured Nessus ( http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus )
* Installed and configured Rootkit Hunter ( http://www.rootkit.nl/projects/rootkit_hunter.html )
* Installed and configured Linux Malware Detect ( http://www.rfxn.com/projects/linux-malware-detect/ )
* Installed and configured chkrootkit ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chkrootkit )

**Other**

* Backups occur daily (for now)
* A script is setup to check everything to ensure everything remains up.
* An external script is setup to check uptime, as well as an account with Pingdom to also check for uptime. We will be notified if something does go down.

--------------------------

I realise a lot of this is redundant (eg. Why have fail2ban when SSH password logins are disabled?), but I don't want to take any chances.

I know there can never be a 100% secure server, especially considering that after all of this work it's going to be some PHP script that allows an exploit, but for the sake of argument let's say that the only script that will be running is a ""Hello World!"" script, thus security is as high as it can be.

What are Reddit's thoughts? Any suggestions on how to tighten this sucker a little more? I would *LOVE* some assistance from a seasoned professional, especially someone that does this on a daily basis for well known sites (any Reddit server admins around? :))

I came into a new company where a lot of different sshd_configs on a lot of machines grew over the years. Now we want to standardize and in this process harden it. I know there's not a lot to do, but I want to be sure that I did all which was possible. My sshd_config now looks like this:    

    #OpenSSH Standard Mumbo Jumbo cut
    
    StrictModes yes
    Protocol 2
    ListenAddress 10.0.0.0
    LoginGraceTime 60

    PasswordAuthentication no
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

    # Notsureaboutthis

    PrintLastLog yes
    
    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
    AuthorizedKeysFile /path/to/files/%u

    MACs hmac-sha1,umac-64@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160

    
Login is only via Public Key, but root login is needed. Is there any possibility to further secure the config? Perhaps remove even more ciphers or MACs? As far as I know these are considered secure.

* learn programming and contribute to open source (I have very little programming experience, and I'm not really looking to be a developer)

I was thinking maybe automatically permanently blocking any ip that has ten consecutive ssh login fails, or a reverse-ip lookup of all ssh connections.  Is there any way to accomplish this?

It's safe to say that at least 30% of these have not been used and are not needed.  How did things get this way?

They have never had any sort of centralized... anything.  They had several admins who could create, clone, and move servers around for the last 2 years.  Some of these were developers on various experiments and projects (some which may be expired), some of them contractors, and former employees.  So what I got was a ton of poorly labeled servers in various states in development, testing, and production.  Almost nothing is documented, although from their IPs I have been able to find various tickets where former admins were asked to create something for some group.  

Things I already removed:  machines powered off, machines with no network capability, machines in a state of degradation where they could not be used (bad disk sectors, kernel panics on boot, in a VLAN no longer in existence, etc).  

Now I am ready to tackle some of the less obvious orphans.  Many have uptimes in the hundreds of days.  Most are CentOS 5, some Debian 6.

- Those with web servers, I am going to check their traffic logs and network connections.
- Those with database servers, I am going to check their network connections.
- Check lastlog and compare it to sudoers and /etc/passwd
- Check date stamps of various /home directories, and see what is in them.  Sadly, a majority of these people never created more than a root user.
- I'd check secure and messages, but most have been long since lost with logrotate, so my decision would have to be based on 5 weeks of data and no further back.

I have been authorized that if I have a serious doubt to ""shut it off and see who complains"" especially in the dev and testing space.  Then, after 30 days, if no one says anything, I can delete them.

First, a little background. I started leaning Linux on Mandrake, then went to Fedora, then Debian, then got a job working with a 100% FreeBSD environment. I started toying with Ubuntu around 2006, and I first put it into production in 2008.

Now at my current gig (mixed Windows &amp; Linux environment), I went with Ubuntu server edition because I know I'll move on at some point, and I don't know for a fact that the company will invest in a replacement with commensurate Linux experience.

So, I figured that setting up a stable Ubuntu environment would be like throwing my successor a softball. ""Here's everything, it works, there's a huge online community for support, and there's solid documentation with specifics in-house and general docs on the web.""

Really, it does everything I need it to do &amp; does it well. Web servers, DNS servers, DHCP, firewalls, email, mailing lists, print servers, file servers, automation, Puppet, virtualization hosts &amp; guests, OpenLDAP single sign-on for everything that needs it in the environment, VoIP, replication, incremental on-site &amp; off-site backups, and on down the list. The only issues I see these days are because an ISP's line goes down or a piece of hardware fails.

So, what's so bad about running Ubuntu LTS releases in a small production environment? Granted, Red Hat wins on pay support hands-down, and you definitely want that in a large environment. But, if that's not a factor, what's the rub?

I'm by no means a zealot, and I'm interested in hearing some legit criticisms of Ubuntu in the small production context. Cheers!

First post in this lovely subreddit. I came across it today and thought I'd pose a question that I've been wondering the answer to for some time. Some background, I've been in the Navy eight years most recently as a Sr. Network Engineer, and System Administrator. This includes experience with some of the largest networks in the world, and how huge (government) enterprise does business. I also had a stint on a ship with ~1500 users and four operational computer networks and various systems, including managing 80+ Windows, RHEL, and Solaris 10 servers. I am certified Security+ and RHCSA. One caveat for those unfamiliar: The US government is slow to change, and open source isn't widely accepted in that realm yet. Furthermore, patching/etc is a very controlled process, downloading any updates from a trusted patching server after upstream entities vette them.

Fast forward to today: I left the military, and am now a freshman undergrad looking for work. I see all these job postings for linux administration and there are many terms that I 'understand' but I'm really unsure what they mean in context with technologies I've never had exposure to. They may very well be referring to something I can relate to or extrapolate my experience, but even after googling I find the cognitive leap difficult in some cases. Example [job posting](http://www.dice.com/job/result/10271304/912662?src=19&amp;q=system%20administrator):


This part is pretty self explanatory.

    Operating Systems:
    Strong experience with Red Hat Linux
    Strong experience with Windows
    Hands on Experience with Solaris
    Hands on Experience with Unix Variants

Working my way down: **PHP engines**. Proficiency in this case as simply I have installed one of these applications before? I understand job postings aren't always written by tech managers but really? Configuration I could understand, but you should be able to find the documentation and be familiar with it inside of an hour or two. **J2EE containers**. I've never had an opportunity to touch/see one of these in operation. Is there anything pertinent that isn't general application knowledge? Something like quirks they have with user load? **Portal and collaborative technologies.** I confess, unless they're talking about Sharepoint or CITRIX I'm really at a loss what they mean here. Some form of wiki for internal staff? **Content and Document Management Technologies** I don't know that I've ever seen a dedicated management solution for this, mostly homegrown stuff. Good docs are important, but any insight here? **System Monitoring, Instrumentation, Configuration Management** Is this referring to SNMP polling, dashboards for incident management, and updating your documentation? **Flow Control Technologies** SVN is a version control system, isn't it? Is this simply referring to managing the backend of something like that? **SaaS, PaaS, Cloud** VMware, web applications, application servers? **Distributed Technologies** Uhhh. I feel like I'm missing the buzzword train here.

 
    Middle-tier Technologies:
    Strong experience with PHP Engines – Proficiency in setting up and managing Wordpress/Drupal
    Strong experience with J2EE Containers (Tomcat, JBoss etc.)
    Hands on Experience with Portal &amp; Collaborative Technologies
    Hands on Experience with Content &amp; Document Management Technologies
    Strong experience with System Monitoring, Instrumentation &amp; Configuration Management
    Hands on Experience with Flow Control Technologies (JIRA, SVN etc.)
    Hands on Experience with SaaS, PaaS, Cloud Technologies
    Hands on Experience with Distributed Technologies
 
**Web servers** This one sounds mostly simple to me. Install, configure, manage, monitor a web server, load balancing, etc. **Web Server connectors** The best I get with Google here is a connector is a piece of code that connects a front facing server to it's back end counterparts. What exactly does that mean to a sysadmin? **Caching Solutions** I'm pretty sure this is essentially a proxy server, but as much as I'd like I've never been able to work with open source options in a production environment. **Experience with HTML, JS, CSS** Can anyone explain to me what a sysadmin would use this for? I understand the possibility of many hats in some companies, but this still eludes me unless it's setting up a web portal to run your scripts.


    Front-End Technologies:
    Strong experience with Web Servers (Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, IIS etc.)
    Strong experience with Web Server Connectors for PHP, Java, etc.
    Strong experience with Caching Solutions (Squid, Varnish, EHcache, CDN etc.)
    Hands on Experience with HTML, JS, CSS
 
**Databases** I know what a database is. I know DBAs make more money than I probably ever will. I understand how a SAN works. I could trace the architecture of how a full fiber optic virtualized network gets data from one point to another, but I still don't understand what this means in terms of this job listing. **File Systems** I can partition, monitor, destroy partitions, move data around, ensure you don't lose your shit, find your shit when you do lose it, try not to ever type rm -rf * in the root directory. What else is there? I'm not sure if they're just covering their bases or if I'm missing something. **Networking** Basic networking in Linux? Any comments here? **Security and High Availability Concepts** This is one that I feel I've got spot on. **Backup methodologies** tcpdump? What do you guys use? I've never really had to do backups on RHEL, our production servers were attached to SANs which did daily full backups of the entire disks. **Disaster recovery** I know what I would consider this to be...COOP, distributed backups, server images, multiple physical locations. Is this just simply knowing what all this is, and being prepared, and the rest is what the company decides to do? 


    Back-End Technologies:
    Hands on Experience with Databases (Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra etc)
    Strong experience with File Systems (Journaling, IO, Partitioning etc)
    Strong experience with Networking (Interface Bonding, TCP stacking, DNS, IP addressing, Load Balancing, Proxy, Protocols etc.)
    Strong experience with Security, &amp; High Availability Concepts
    Strong experience with Backup methodologies
    Hands on Experience with Disaster Recovery
 
**Scripting** In the environments I've worked in, scripting was mostly frowned upon, or could get you sent directly to jail depending on what you were running. Modification of existing environment even to automate tools wasn't an option, up to and including having Python installed. I've used a few bash scripts here and there, and I've been working on learning Python for about a year now. I still wouldn't say I'm proficient. How much do you guys code, what do you use it for, how does it help you? What is necessary, and what should I know/pursue? After finding things like [Fabric](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/admin/) and other tools listed there, I'm pretty excited about what's possible. Also the realm of remote administration! Using a VPN or a mobile device to access my servers instead of walking my drunk ass to the ship on my day off! Hallelujah! What else? Is this absolutely necessary beyond familiarity with bash? This is the part I'm honestly most concerned about as any other technology I can learn in days, teaching myself to program/script has been a much longer journey and I'm still not there yet.


    Scripting Languages:
    Strong experience with Shell
    Hands on Experience with Perl
    Hands on Experience with Python

I've also seen some looking for strong experience with performance tuning. I had to google that, but it turns out it's basically just monitoring your servers and paying attention, and adjusting things that don't look like system normal? Any further input here? These really are things I would've thought would go without saying for a system administrator position, period...I really appreciate any input you guys may have that furthers my understanding of Linux administration, employability, and any of the above technologies or how to further my knowledge of them. 

Thanks!

It's part of my job, I get paid for it and everything. I've been using Linux on one or more of my computers since 2008, it has been my main OS on all of my computers since early 2009, and since then I've come to love the power of the command line and all of its awesomeness. I'm completely comfortable doing a lot of things with the command line, including basic administration. I've set up web servers and databases (easy), a mail server (which I consider one of my biggest acheivements!), managed a number of different CMSes, administrated groups and users, set up file permissions, git repos for local testing and deployment with gitolite, done post-mortem on a server that me and more experienced admins decided was beyond hope, as well as written some web applications (which isn't Linux administration, but I think it counts for something).

So I have encountered a few problems while working as an admin, but none of them were serious, most of them were just mistakes in configuration. I don't expect things to go that smoothly in the future, and I feel unprepared for it.

What if:

* A server gets DDoSed?
* Someone manages to hack their way in?
* A database suddenly goes really corrupt? (How to do backups well, for both databases and other stuff?)
* A server suddenly gets a kernel panic?
* The sites I run suddenly become really popular and we need to scale up?
* Something else unexpected happens?

Plus there are some areas I just hardly feel I know anything about, like RAID, firewalls, networking/the OSI model, setting up multple servers to serve one site etc. By now you're probably wondering if I should be an admin at all.

Basically, I want to be prepared for as much as I can. I know my way around Linux okay, but okay isn't enough. I've picked up a lot of cli-fu through the years, but I don't feel like I actually have enough knowledge about how the system works to really protect it.

There are efforts underway to change some of that (perhaps hadoop etc)...but movement there is slow. The problem I'm trying to solve in the short term is the .bash_history. 

The problem is that we have an automation system that's running jobs across the servers as well as a team of folks who are doing things by hand (research etc). The bash history turns into a mess. I can't do something interactive like asking for their name because it will mess with the automated jobs.

I almost considered just setting the $HISTFILE to something like HISTFILE=$HISTFILE-$(hostname) and then also setting 'shopt -s append' and then also make it so history appends after each command and not at the end of the session.

Anyone have any neckbeard-guru advice for the situation at hand?

Alright, now I'm getting a little frustrated.  So, I looked at the log from the rsync process that copies everything over to the backup servers.  Absolutely no mention (copy/compare/exclude/delete/ANYTHING) of her Thunderbird profile.

Every once in a while I'll be adding questions that the reader can answer to see if he's understood all the information that's been added regarding the current topic. So it won't just be a massive piece of text but also tries to make the user think about what he's reading.

That's why I want your opinions on the topics that's been listed on the blog. Are they reasonable? Should I add something I've missed? Remove something that's out-dated and replace it with something else? It's aimed at a novice on linux but someone with basic to advanced Microsoft Windows knowledge.

1364346149.0,24,self.linuxadmin,1b2x1o,Massive amount of performance monitoring solution,26,2,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/1b2x1o/massive_amount_of_performance_monitoring_solution/,"So, I'm looking to put together something to help me monitor a massive number of different storage metrics, including:

- physical disk latency, throughput, etc (I have over 10k disks)
- LUN latency/throughput (from a block level, as well as from a filesystem level) [over 1000 LUNs]
- Filesystem statistics
- RDMA stats
- and various other counters

So the problem here, is I have a LOT of data that will need to be monitored, and data input comes from multiple sources.

I'm trying to figure out the best approach (technology/product-wise) to use here; OSS only if possible.

My thoughts were to handle as much of the data collection and storage with collectd running on my filesystem servers (over 150). This would handle host side LUNs stats, SNMP data, RDMA stats, disk latency/service time/etc. These would more or less be collectd clients, which would send everything to a central collectd server. 

The collectd server would export data to Graphite, via the native carbon interface (C). 

From there, I would use Carbon to view all of this data, etc.

My problem is that there doesn't seem to be a good way to leverage a database backend (DB2 is pretty much required in this case) for any of these products.

At the end of the day, what I am looking for is a way to throw a ton of metric data into a solution that uses a backend database, and make it easy to query/visualize. I want a backend database because I don't want to deal with rrd files. I would feel that the IO requirements and the absolutely mess of flat files for all of that data on so many hosts would be too much. We have a very hefty DB2 setup, hence my preference.

At one time a few years ago, I getup ganglia to basically write it's rrd to a tmpfs (then every 10 minutes backed this up to local storage), since it was just killing hard disks.

Now, I could just dump everything in a DB2 instance, and configure Graphite to query this data. But I would rather not reinvent the wheel, since using collectd to gather/manage a large portion of my data is ideal. It standardizes formats, and is easy to write custom plugins.

Any ideas, or has anyone else done something similar?

Thanks!

EDIT: I did a crappy job of outlining the overall goal. I want to dump performance metrics (a lot of them) to a database, and then be able to query/visualize them. I also would like to be able the performance collection if possible into a single piece of OSS for most of our metrics. This means that most of the data I want can be collected easily (via collectd), but certain custom metrics need to be inserted into a database, or be massaged enough to fit into something useful for collectd.

EDIT to explain the software: etckeeper keeps an automatic (and manual changes if you want) control of you etc files in a repository. Benefits:

- Easy way (and almost mandatory if you do the commits manually)to document your changes on files on etc, even if the changes go on batches on different files, the documentantion would be as an unique bloke

- automatic commit pre update and post updates with some hooks at the apt tool, with the collateral benefits of being able to tell exactly what the update made to you etc, and to have a automatic copy of your old version
- If something is erased or overwriten, you have a fresh copy awaiting for you
- you can diff after releases upgrades and compare with any version you want to know, so for instance you can tell apart changes made to the configuration files by the old mantainer of your system (if by chance it was not you) and what the original conf file looked like after an upgrade so you know what to is to keep and where is better to use changes of the mantainer of the package in your distro
- its like messing with git and code! you can mess around all you want and stage your changes until tomorrow because its time to leave and nobody in charge of caring those machines during your absence will ever know

vim stopped working as expected, and i didnt know why or when or how. I checked vimrc file and it was very different from what mine with all my modifications. I checked bash_history and i had, with my very big hands, cp overwriting my file.

Be careful with alt + . its a dangerous command when you are root :)

etckeeper saved the day and i only had to checkout the file and commit the good version :)

I am a career IT guy, have an MCSE and CCNP, worked as a systems engineer for several years, currently work as a network engineer, but I have never touched linux*.  

I just have never taken the time to familiarize myself with it, and I don't know why as I have always wanted to.  I know the very basics, scoring around 50% on a Linux+ practice test just from cursory knowledge and decent test taking ability.  

My question is: if I want to become proficient to the point where I would be a capable admin, where should I start?  I feel kinda lost as far as what is even the best way to get started...

-* I have installed Ubuntu on a box at home a few times, futzed around with it a bit, then lost interest and abandoned it, but for all practical purposes I have no experience with it.

**Edit**

Wow, thanks for all the replies.  Good information all around.  I am going to reply to posts directly here in a sec (may have to step away again for meetings) but some more general info.

**I have no idea what makes the different distros different.  I do know that (or it least it seems that) Ubuntu is generally kinda of looked down on by experienced linux guys as a kiddie version, but even then I don't know why.  Recommendations for different distributions are great, and I especially appreciate the explanations as to why one is recommended over another.

**I would be looking for learning in the context of a corporate enterprise environment - not because I want to get out of network engineering (which I love) - but because I would like to understand better what's going on in ""their"" world.  I also don't think it would hurt future employment prospects to have a solid working knowledge of other areas of the infrastructure.  I am also just curious about things I guess.

A couple of additional questions if I may:

Would it be feasible for me to install a linux server with no GUI for learning purposes in my lab environment to force myself to use the CLI for everything, or would it be better to have some sort of GUI to fall back on when I get ""stuck""?

Would it be practical to just pick up some RHCE materials and start working through it, doing remedial coursework as required, or would I just be setting myself up for failure by biting off more than I can chew?

I plan on connecting directly to my cable modem and leaving sshd running with port 22 open. That's the only thing I'm fairly certain would get it some attention. I also want to run a few other services to see how they are compromised (namely openldap, postfix, squid, and samba).

Should I run these programs one at a time? In other words, do a fresh install, only install ssh, wait for it to be compromised, fix it, and then install samba? Or should I just install all programs at once? Which logs should I be watching specifically (besides the auth log)? 

How will I know when my system is compromised?

Can I expect my system to be compromised within minutes? In other words, should I just sit back with tail -f and wait? Or should I maybe check it once a day (or week)?

I have been employed in an IT role since just after high school (so 14 years or so now).  My friends/family know I'm in IT.

By ""rather large"", I mean on the order of 70+GiB. All InnoDB, file per table.  Single RW master, a handful of RO relay masters, and a number of RO slaves covering production, testing, and development environments.  Performance doesn't seem to be a major issue currently, though part of that may be due to the very beefy systems that run this platform.  The code is maintained by the development team who created the platform, and is very much under active development.

To give a comparison, another web platform I maintain covers a similar number of client sites, but has a more manageable database that clocks in at around 10GiB.

Naturally, this makes backing up or restoring the database take quite a long time.  I could theoretically use mysqldump to grab all tables from one of my slaves (my typical MO with our other platform), but I never had a successful restore in any of my initial tests.  It gets to about the 8-10 hour mark and dies for one reason or another.

With looming deadlines and only so much time to troubleshoot, I took the low road and used rsync to copy the binary log and database directories to our new hosts.  This method works great and only takes 1-2 hours for a full backup and restore.  They will then spin up cleanly as a relay master and begin synchronizing with the read-write master.  Through manipulation of my.cnf, the new slaves can be designated as either a RO slave or a relay master as needed.

While I have successfully used this method of effectively 'cloning' the database onto a new system a number of times now, I wonder if there is a better way to accomplish this.  Has anyone else dealt with large MySQL InnoDB databases?  Got a better way to accomplish this?  I'd be interested to hear what others do in a situation such as this.

- There's no monitoring on servers. I'd like to get something (Nagios?) to fix that.

- We don't have an easy way to install software across all the computers in the lab - there's a solution the current administrators have put together using cronjobs and scripts, but I'd to see if I can find something a little less kludgey.

- Finally - and there may be no easy solution to this - we have an NFS system set up where everyone's /home directory is stored on the NFS server, but sometimes it seems like it chugs during heavy usage (ex if the professors have the ""Introduction to Computer Science"" class in the lab and tell them to all hit ""compile"" at once).

I've been getting more and more complaints about spam getting through our email filters, and wanted to poll you guys to find out what you've found to be the most effective antispam techniques on the server side. 

Two years ago we implemented greylisting and it's been a GREAT success. However, I can tell that a LOT more spammers are using well behaved mailers and retrying the emails after my timeout period. 

Here's my current setup: 
Debian Linux running OldStable (5.0.9)
Exim 4
SpamAssasin (With minimal customization)
ClamAV

All connections are run through an ACL that immediately drops connections based on certain high risk RBLs. 

Then, if any of the following conditions are met, the email is greylisted. 
    They appear in a large list of lower risk RBLs
    Their IP doesn't resolve to a common TLD (com, net, org, gov, edu, mil, us)
    Reverse DNS isn't set up properly
    Their IP is not a US IP address

The email is then checked for viruses via Clam, checked for certain words in the subject, checked for a couple other miscellaneous conditions and blocked if conditions are met. 

The email is then shipped off to SA to be spam scanned and tagged if it's spammy enough. 

Finally it's considered a ""real"" email and delivery is attempted. 

What are some techniques that I'm missing here, where can I see big gains? Is it worth it to put the effort into customizing SA? Is there a RBL that is a MUST have. Is there some new realtime spam scanner that's better than SA?

Here's what advice I'm NOT looking for: ""Get a barracuda"", ""just use gmail"", ""upgrade to the newest version of Debian"".

The device has only 128MB of RAM so I also use a 256MB of swap just in case. Upon boot the memory looks like that:

                 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
    Mem:           105         24         81          0          0          7
    -/+ buffers/cache:         16         89
    Swap:          243          0        243

When I start to copy a file from a samba server on this device, 'cached' quickly starts to grow. As soon as cached fills up almost all of the memory (~90MB) three things happen: kswapd kicks in, smbd starts to be swapped away and the file copy performance drops. 

*edit: I have confirmed this with iostat. As soon as kswapd kicks in, w_await jumps from 0 to ~500 and %util to 99%.*

Interestingly, this happens **regardless** of the setting of vm.swappiness and vm.vfs_cache_pressure (e.g. swappiness 0 or 1 and vfs_cache_pressure 500)

In my scenario, caching 90MBs of a file read from over 2TB attached storage is quite pointless. What's even worse, disk cache is given priority over application memory. 

If I clear the cache during the copy process to prevent it from filling up the memory (by repeatedly doing echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches) I suffer from **no** performance drop. Hardly a solution to the problem, though.

It appears that this particular problem is known in the mysql community ([here](http://don.blogs.smugmug.com/2008/05/01/mysql-and-the-linux-swap-problem/) or [here](http://jcole.us/blog/archives/2010/09/28/mysql-swap-insanity-and-the-numa-architecture/) ) but I can't help thinking that it is me who is doing something wrong. 

TL;DR can't make overzealous disk caching go away.

Please advise.

edit: came across [this](http://code.google.com/p/pagecache-mangagement/), seems abandoned

edit2: did some more reading on the issue, I suppose that patching samba (or perhaps writing a vfs module?) to use POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE could work, assuming it's implemented [already](http://lwn.net/Articles/449420/).

A few details in case it's needed:

It's running with tun0 on tcp port 443 and using server-generated certificates. It uses ""redirect-gateway def1"" and pushes itself as the DNS server and uses dnsmasq to offer that service. It also has ssh and ntop running. Ntop is accessible only to those already connected to the openvpn server (firewall blocks everything going to its port except 172.16.1.1/24, which is the openvpn gateway).

I'm a contractor hired by company X who works for company Y to do general sysadmin stuff.  


About a year and a half ago, I interviewed for a database job in front of a panel of of ten older gentlemen. I ended up not getting the job.

Fast forward to last week, my contract manager messages me and says something along the lines of, ""Are you interested in a unix/linux position? It's yours if you want it.""

It seemed very fishy at first, so I asked my contract manager why he would want me working on an operating system that i have, quite literally, zero experience with. He said that when I had my interview a year and a half ago, one of the older gentlemen was very impressed with me and my abilities and skills. It turns out that the gentleman was one of the head IT managers for company X. I negotiated getting a substantial bump in pay and organized a meeting with the gentleman who had been keeping his eye on me for awhile and wanted me to work in this position. 

A few days later, I met with the IT manager and my future Team Lead. It was very non-chalant and the IT manager apologized and explained why I hadn't received a job offer for the database position awhile back. He chose someone who had been working at the company for 7+ years and wanted to make sure whoever got the position was someone who had a lot of longevity at the current workplace (I had only been working for around 6 months at the time of the interview)

The Team Lead explained the position and what people in my role typically do on a day-to-day basis. I came to the conclusion that the stuff I would be working on are 1-and-done problems. As in, this is an issue you'll see once in your life time and then never, ever again.

Currently, I'm a Windows SysAdmin with ~2+ years of experience in an enterprise environment.     

What I would like to know is, how the hell can I get some really *good* experience with Linux in a relatively short amount of time? From what I've been told, most of the work is done on Red Hat.

Very fast speeds (250MB/s, 30000iops) can be had for a dollar per GB in last years drives, which now have pretty mature firmwares. For example the huge line of drives with Sandforce SF-2281 controllers. Why not use them for servers? For servers you usually want some kind of Raid (like a small Raid1). And/or LVM.

But it looks like the kind of drives I am talking about (RAInexpensiveD) expect TRIM[1] to be used on them. I found it very hard to see which Linux server distributions really do support TRIM going through the LVM and Raid layers. I did see mailing list announcements that version X of the kernel now has a patch supporting TRIM for mdraid. Same for LVM. But are those patches being backported to 3.2? Because Linux 3.2 seems to be the up and coming server kernel (at least for Debian based distros). Does TRIM actually work if you have an LVM sitting on top of a Raid1?

Since btrfs supports both TRIM and a lot of features found in mdraid and LVM, what about backports here? Are btrfs fixes being backported to 3.2?

Recently I added a 5th drive to expand the array and immediately noticed a performance slowdown. It's still fast enough to e.g., stream videos, but the peak throughput is crap (&lt; 2 MB/s). Given the load average will spike with no program reporting any sort of CPU or memory usage I figure it's gotta be a ton of XOR calculations.

My initial reaction was to just buy a RAID card but I thought I ought to check here first. With that in mind -

If your goal was to increase existing raid performance sufficiently well that you could expect to add a 6th drive and have performance of at least 5 MB/s would you ...
 

* Buy a ""hardware raid"" controller card. What brand(s) would you recommend?

.XenServer with XenClient and Trixbox installed on a Virtual Machine. The snapshots on this are extremely easy, but automated backups cost 1500$ to unlock.

All of a sudden, actual clients, who are using the test machine (don't get me started), are seeing the PHP applications and DB connections slow down and stall out ""every once in a while"".  So of course, the troubleshooting path started with step 1:  I built the machine and spun up their VM, so it is my fault.  This of course is supported by the fact that ssh login's take like 45 seconds to do... 

Basically if you ssh as user@test.machine, it will prompt you for accepting the key immediately unless it's already there, and then it will wait for about 45 seconds to a minute before prompting you for a password.  I've actually seen it time out and never prompt a few times as well.

running ssh -vv (from my own home machine) I see that it is hanging at this point consistently..

debug2: key: /home/rhanthony/.ssh/identity ((nil))
debug2: key: /home/rhanthony/.ssh/id_rsa ((nil))
debug2: key: /home/rhanthony/.ssh/id_dsa ((nil))

Other info that may or may not make a difference is that we do not have reverse dns to match test.company.com hostname, and ssh is running on a different port... 

At this point I am genuinely interested in speeding up the SSH login issue, because it's present on two VM's they're using and I'd like to understand more of why it's happening.  I am however, MUCH more interested in clearing this up so I can simply prove to them that a slow SSH login has 0 to do with their PHP code in our web app, on a development and very buggy server, that they are letting clients use for some reason.

**TL;DR = SSH waits 45-60 seconds before prompting for password, if at all.  Developers blame slow PHPapp/DBconnections on this, thus, it's my fault.  How can I speed up SSH to fix the delay, and make them realize it's a separate issue?**

For obvious reasons, we don't have write permission for each other's home directories, but there's nothing stopping us from accessing and reading them. Now, we all have sudo permission on our own workstations, giving us root access to administrate our own machines (but, theoretically, nobody else's). As root, we cannot write to our own (or anyone else's) NFS mounted home directories. This makes sense to me: obviously the local root account for a single workstation should not have universal read/write access to data owned by users authenticated over NIS. 

The problem is this: with local machine root access, I can use su to obtain a shell for any user. If I pick an NIS-authenticated user, I am not prompted for a password and am given a shell for that user. From there, I can happily access and read/write files in that user's home directory as though I had successfully authenticated myself as that user, *even though I have not done so.* This seems like a big deal.

I originally posted to linux4noobs but told I would bet a better answer here.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 x64 and I am looking to use it as a replacement for our FileZilla FTP server running on Server 2003 on an old power hungry Dell PE2900. The box that Ubuntu is installed on is a H Microserver with 4gb and the DualCore AMS processor.

I want to setup a FTP server that allows for multiple users to access a single root FTP directory, such as /srv/ftp/shared. The caveat is that I am looking to provide certain users read/write and other users just read access based on there role in the organization.

I am a Windows Admin and I would normally just be able to set up Security Groups and apply NTFS permissions for what I want to accomplish, but I am not sure how I can accomplish this on Ubuntu. I want to use this as a learning experience.

If it can auth of my current AD domain that would be even better, but one step at a time.

Thank you all.

**Edit:** So I have been trying some of the suggestions below and have created a group called ftpshared and a user called ftpuser.  I have added ftpuser to the ftpshared group.

I modified the /etc/ssh/sshd_config, commented out Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server and added the following to the bottom of the sshd_config file:

    Subsytem sftp internal-sftp
    Match Group ftpshared
        ChrootDirectory /srv/ftp/shared
        ForceCommand internal-sftp
        X11Forwarding no
        AllowTCPForwarding no

I then did chmod 1775 /srv/ftp/shared and chown root:ftpshared /srv/ftp/shared

Now when I goto login from say FileZilla I get a network connection error and looking at /var/log/auth.log I see numerous, fatal: bad ownership or modes for chroot directory /srv/ftp/shared.

How do I resolve this now?  Doing some research show I need to make the permissions 755 on the /srv/ftp/shared but that would not allow for what I am trying to do.

Any other suggestions?  Thanks a bunch.

I then ran loggen to test how many messages per second it could process. I was reading about performance tweaks I could do to increase performance, but I wanted to get a base-line number first to see if I was actually benefiting from these adjustments. 

Now initially, I hit a limit of about 8600msg/sec which was pretty low I thought. None of the tweaks made this number any higher either. So I decided to write the logs locally, instead of sending them over the network and I got the same 8600/sec. So I started sending logs to /dev/null thinking maybe the hard drive was limiting me, but still 8600/sec. Loggen says my bandwidth is only 2250.58 kB/sec, so I feel like I have plenty of overhead, and my cpu barely hits 30% load. 

I thought maybe the laptop was too old so I moved to my i5 desktop, and just barely hit 9000/sec. So to make sure I wasn't crazy I logged onto the mail server, and set loggen to test with a rate of 1,000,000/sec. The test spiked at 212,000msg/sec before I cancelled it. 

So what I don't understand is how from a clean install of syslog-ng my machine logging locally (or /dev/null) can't do more than 9,000/sec but the server sending data over the network is more than 20x as fast. 

I don't know much about syslog-ng so it's entirely possible I've just done something wrong but here's my syslog-ng.conf settings:


source s_test {
       udp(ip(127.0.0.1) port(5002));

destination d_test {

log {

I am a contract programmer/consultant for a small manufacturing company.  I have done work for this company since the early 80's when their entire operation was run on a Wang mini-computer using packaged software written in Cobol; application are AR, AP, GL, Inventory, Order Entry/Invoicing, Bill of Material, and Sales History.  In early 2000 there old Wang hardware was replaced with a Dell Power-edge server running Open SUSE running a virtual machine environment which runs the Wang OS and there applications, and I must say this has worked out well for them.  Over the years their old Wang terminals have been replaced with PCs which run a Wang terminal interface giving each user access to the old Wang applications as well as access to the internet and email capabilities.  As it stands now there are about 14-16 PCs connected to the network via wireless but it is a hodge-pog of Dells, HPs, and no-names, running everything from XP to MS 7, various USB wireless devices and printers.

I would like to bring some order to this environment and I am toying with the idea of replacing all of the various Windows OS with a common distro of Linux (probably Linux Mint 13 Mate or XFCE).

I have installed a test PC with Linux Mint 13 (originally tried Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon but graphics were to glitchy and Firefox kept freezing up).  The Wang terminal interface runs without a problem under Wine.  All of the users are running Libre Office as their office suite so there is no problem there.  There are a couple of external Windows applications which may or may not run under Wine but I figure I can either install a VM running a guest Windows OS or just leave one of the PCs running Windows because these applications are only used once or twice a day for downloading external orders(EDI) and acknowledgement.

I am looking at installing Linux on each machine with my login and password as admin, installing a second user account (non-admin) for each user and a third guest account (non-admin) so if a user own PC has a problem they can sign in on another PC as a guest until I can fix their PC.  The reason for this is I really don't want the users installing all kinds of crap on the systems as they have done with the Window PCs. Thus, keeping control over the terminal environment.  The only problem I have encountered with this setup is the users not having admin rights cannot shut down their systems at night but I'm sure there is a way around this.

My Questions:

* Is there a better distro for this purpose?

* Do you have any suggestions or cautions I need to consider?

* Any other specialized software such as monitoring, etc I should install?

* Any suggestions with regards to printer setup?

* Generally what have I forgotten or missed?

I understand the fact that the majority of the PC's are connected to the network as wireless is not the best option and it has gotten worse since a switch to AT&amp;T Uverse using a 2wire 3600hgv router has been installed.  From a completely cold start and by that I mean all PC's shut down the IP address assignment on the router being cleared and the modem shut down and restarted.  The users can all get logged in but if a PC is subsequently shut down and restarted it appears to not be able to re-acquire the address.  This problem seems to have been intensified with the addition of a Netgear wireless extender.  It appears that I can over come most of these problems by assigning a specific IP address at each of the PC's but even that has been no guarantee.

I spend a lot of my spare time trying out different things under Linux, such as web servers, samba servers, etc. I enjoy working in IT, but I would really like to make the switch to Linux administration and would like to get a job in a larger organization.

I feel that my Linux skills are pretty strong, as well as my understanding of networking. But I wonder what distro experience, application experience, etc. that larger organizations look for. What particular area might I need to focus on that would make an impression?

I should also mention that I don't have a degree. I have a several certifications (A+, Network+, Security+, MCP), and a little more than 5 years experience. But every job posting for junior admins seems to require a Bachelors Degree in CS. So I suppose my first question would be: is it even possible to get a Linux admin job without a CS degree?

It was definitely there and taking requests, but it was so slow that it felt like it was down. I could not even access WHM to attempt a reboot of Apache and MySQL.
After maybe an hour, the server came back up and everything seemed to be fine, however I managed to SSH into it and found the process **ksoftirqd** was taking 100% of the CPU time. After a few minutes, it calmed down and everything was back to normal.

I have now just received an e-mail (pasted below) saying that the our server has been involved in a netscan!?

I checked the SSH history (history command) and found nothing unusual. This isn't really my area of expertise, so I'd love some assistance.
I didn't setup the server, but I will harden it a little very soon (such as changing the SSH port!).

Does anyone know how this could have happened and what I can do in future to prevent it?
Is it a spoof attack of some sort? I figure it's not because the server itself died for an hour. It must be some other type of attack, but I don't know where to start looking.

1336915414.0,10,self.linuxadmin,tkx9l,SSD + HDD + MDADM Sanity Check,19,9,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/tkx9l/ssd_hdd_mdadm_sanity_check/,"**tl;dr:** i've got SSDs and HDDs in my system.  wanting to run a dual boot with drives in raid configs.  would love the $0.02 from people much smarter than me.

**Here's what I've got currently:**
I've got 2 64GB SSDs and 2 500GB HDDs.  yes, each pair are matched drives.  Each set is in its own RAID 1 configuration (SSDs: md0 and HDDs: md1).  md0 is running the OS (currently ubuntu 11.lame).  md1 contains data and is currently being mounted at /home.  just for a touch of irrelevent information... md0 is ext4 while md1 ext3.  Not sure I went with those fstypes when I did, but I did.  It might have to do with the fact that md1, in essence, is much older than md0 (by at least a year or two).  swap space is currently being hosted on a small slice of the SSDs


**This is what I'm wanting:**
I've grown somewhat tired of ubuntu and would like to get back to my roots.  I miss debian.  At the very least, I want a dual boot of debian and ubuntu.  This is a general purpose desktop, so it gets fiddled with occassionally, writes software, manages spreadsheets, that kind of thing.  I don't really play games on it and I've got a completely different machine for a media server, so it doesn't need to do any of that type of stuff either.

Ultimately, I'm wanting a machine that:

* has a fast boot time and fast application response (SSDs)

* provides redundancy of both my data and my application installs (mdadm)

* has the ability to easily make backups and restores with minimal work.

* I don't want to have to mess with anything after I get it physically built and installed.

* makes sandwiches.


**This is how I'm thinking about doing it:**

* Like I mentioned above, I'm wanting a dual boot of ubuntu and debian, but still want the piece of mind that RAID provides.

* I'm thinking of creating 2 raid1 partitions on the SSDs with 1 for debian and 1 for ubuntu, and of course the swap space.

* For the HDDs, I'm thinking of reducing the size of the /home raid1 partition to free up some disk space so that I can also take a sliver of one (or both) of the HDDs and mount it at /tmp to at least make some semblance of effort to reduce the amount of writes happening to the SSDs.

* Since debian and ubuntu are so similar, I was thinking of using the same /home partition for each operating system.

* just as an aside, I'm planning on doing the discard, noatime and nodiratime to fstab to somewhat increase the SSDs performance as well as looking up other SSD tweaks.  I'm happy to hear your suggestions if you have any.


**This is what I'm wanting from you, my fellow redditors:**

* am I just completely bat-shit insane for wanting to do things this way?

* I know that in spite of Ubuntu being somewhat debian based, they're still different.  Can you think of any issues I might encounter by using the same /home partition for each OS?

* I've also found an article suggestions that I move the tempfs to memory via fstab so I'm thinking about doing that, although this is a development/research machine, and I've been known to use heavy loads of memory at times.

* Lets have a conversation.  I'm not looking for a howto, I'm looking for a sanity check and suggestions for different approaches to my problems.


**more sauce for your chicken:**
I just recenetly ran into issues with an HDD failing which actually caused a whole bunch of other problems (note to all SSD users: UPDATE YOUR FIRMWARE.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED).  thankfully I was able to get back ups of everything, firmwares updated, RAID partitions rebuilt, etc before everything became a complete shit sandwich.


While I have tried to be as descriptive as possible, I'll make sure to update this information as people ask questions in an effort to prevent people from having to dig through the comments for more information about my system / setup.  Thank each and every one of you for your time.  even if your just reading along.


Edit:
Adding more info here:

* I do take somewhat regular backups and understand that RAID is not an excuse to NOT do backups.  While they are still manual at the moment, I do plan on re-implementing some automated scripts I was using a couple years ago.  

* Thanks to everyone for re-iterating the... ""RAID is not an excuse to NOT do backups"".  Seriously, people can't hear that enough.

* I've been messing with Linux for about 10 years now and while I'm certainly no alan cox, I'm not a complete newb either.

* I'm a big boy and am not afraid to break out a man page, book or hunt down specific topics on these here intarwebbers.  I know there have been a lot of really cool developments the past few years and I haven't exactly been keeping up with the bleeding edge of new stuff going on with the different distros (or even cutting edge for that matter, I've been so busy with other stuff these past several years, it almost feels like I'm on the blunt edge.  graduate school has a tendancy to do that).

I have a directory of old game recordings that I want to stream. I already set up a script to load the files individually through ffmpeg and stream it to twitch.tv -- and it works fine.

The problem is switching videos. Once one instance of ffmpeg quits (after successfully streaming a file), thus killing the stream (sending it offline) temporarily until another ffmpeg instance starts up and begins streaming the next video. It is unpractical to have this happen, I need the stream to be live constantly.


    ffmpeg -i file -preset fast -threads 0 -vcodec libx264 -crf 33 -maxrate 400k -ar 22050 -f flv rtmp://live.justin.tv/app/stream_key

Now, some things I've thought / read of:

 * use ffmpeg to generate an .flv file from the video files(i.e. it steps over all the files in a directory and writes that to a single .flv), then use another instance of ffmpeg to stream the .flv file. This seems to introduce lagg in the stream, and it doesn't work as expected, the stream still goes offline after a file ends.

 * Have vlc media player output an .sdp stream file, and use ffmpeg to stream that to twitch. The problem with this is that I cannot dynamically change the playlist(my script simply reads a .txt file that I can change, thus I can add/remove anything at will from another script), and it also seems to introduce lagg into the output stream.

 * named pipes, or concatting files before feeding them to ffmpeg. The problem with this is again I cannot dynamically change the playlist (I have to feed it a fixed list of files).


Using just ffmpeg, the results are pretty good on the stream (definitely watchable, and I still have some tweaking to do), but I can only enter one file to stream before ffmpeg must be killed (thus ending the stream) to switch videos.


Does anyone have a solution or ideas to my problem? Any help is appreciated! I've been trying to find a solution for hours now. I'm open to non-ffmpeg solutions provided they work, thanks!

About 2 years ago a client of mine was running an old Wang mini computer for their internal business applications but the hardware maintenance cost where becoming astronomical.  I found a company that created a custom VM which allowed the company to continue to run the Wang operating system and COBOL application on Dell Poweredge running OpenSuse (Linux) running the OS in the VM.  In addition, I took the opportunity to install a Dell PC which I am using as a Web Server &amp; Email server using Debian.  We originally had AT&amp;T DSL with a static IP and an older 2Wire modem which acted as a wireless router.  There are about 15 to 20 PC both wired and wireless that connected for internet access and internal access to the Wang VM.  I had all of this working including the Email which is/was accessed by salesman all over the country and the Website.  Then some horse-ass in the company decided to upgrade to AT&amp;T Uverse and my HELL began first my Static IP was dropped and we where switched to dynamic.  The DSL modem we had was switched out for a 2wire 3801hgv router.  When nothing worked I was finally called.  We now have 8 static IP's of which 6 are usable by design.  It appears that no one in tech support really knows how to configure the router properly to get me access to my Static IP's as well as allowing the router to issue dynamic IP's for my internal wireless pc's which are mostly Windows XP, Vista, and a few Linux.  IT support goes dumb as soon as I mention my Linux servers.  Also no manual comes with the router but I have finally managed to find a copy on the internet but I am by no means a Network expert.  I know I have to change the ""interfaces"" file to get the server to recognize the Static IP and change or have changed my DNS for the new static IP.  What else do I need to change and what other IP addresses do I need off the router to get my client back up.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post, if better place let me know.

Edit:

The static IP's are as follows;

* xxx.xxx.xxx.144 Static IP (non usable) Host
* xxx.xxx.xxx.145 Static IP to a PC running Debian
* xxx.xxx.xxx.146 Static IP to OpenSuse running the VM
* xxx.xxx.xxx.147 Static IP future use
* xxx.xxx.xxx.148 Static IP future use
* xxx.xxx.xxx.149 Static IP to Debian Web &amp; Email Server
* xxx.xxx.xxx.150 Static IP (non usable) Gateway
* xxx.xxx.xxx.151 Static IP (non usable) Broadcast

the netmask for the group is 255.255.255.248 according to AT&amp;T
The router itself has it's own static ip, netmast and gateway.

I know I have to change the /etc/network/interface file on the Debian servers:
auth etho
iface inet static ip
address (would be one of the static IP listed above)
question is should the netmask and the gateway IP's be the netmask and gateway IP of the static group or of the router which has a separate static IP, netmask, &amp; gateway.
I have already changed over the DNS server IP address for the web and email server.

I don't really expect anyone to be able to help with the router configuration.  I have talked to tech support on three separate occasions and had them factory reset the router/modem three different ways.  I have eliminated one way it could be setup because it would limit the wireless PC because of limiting dynamic assignment. 

Sorry for grammer and misspelling but it now 1:00 AM and I been struggling with this all day and night and tech support hell.

I hope I'm in the right place. I have an interesting situation that I hope can be resolved by you fine people, unless I'm in the wrong subreddit. Anyway, I am implementing an Alfresco server that will be accessed by clients. In light of recent discovery, I have a wildcard SSL certificate that I have at my disposal -- one Alfresco server is currently using it as well.  Because I am completely new to installing such, I hope you can guide me. Unfortunately, there is no account information available regarding the certificate since this was implemented before me.  Here are my goals:

1) I want the new Alfresco server to use Apache to redirect 80 (and 8080) traffic to 443.
2) I want to configure Apache with SSL and install the wildcard certificate (there is a group that has a few certificates with .pem extensions --&gt; I hope that is feasible) so that clients can use this certificate instead of the self-signed that comes with Alfresco
3) I want to know if there are ways to test whether I compiled mod_jk correctly. 
4) Is there anything I need to do on Tomcat's side to get this working, other than using the connector?

My largest problem is that I just don't know enough yet about all of this, and I'm hoping that it something easy. I've tried to direct ssl.conf to the wildcard certificate, but I'm getting an error when trying to start httpd in that, ""Server should be SSL-aware but has no certificate configured"".

I can give more detail as necessary. I appreciate your help!


EDIT: I appreciate all of the help from you guys and gals! I was able to figure out the problem, and that there were a couple things:

-HTTPD service kept failing because I had the vhost :443 designated in both ssl.conf and httpd.conf, so there was a conflict. I moved the configuration of the individual vhost for the server to ssl.conf.
-I was able to keep the *:80 on httpd.conf to redirect that traffic to 443

I'm hoping for an easy solution to this issue.

Basically I'm converting from one mail system to another, and I have everything working correctly except editing the sieve rules.

The new webmail platform we use doesn't support ""anyof"" statements in the sieve filter, and we have thousands of users that use rules with anyof. The easy solution that I can get finished before the deadline is to convert all of these rules from anyof to allof.

**Before Conversion:**

    require ""fileinto"";
    if anyof (header :contains ""Subject"" ""Some Subject Here"",
              header :contains ""From"" ""sender1@example.com"") {
      fileinto ""newsletters"";

    require ""fileinto"";

          header :contains [""Subject""] ""Some Subject Here""

      fileinto ""newsletters"";

    { 
      fileinto ""newsletters"";
      stop;
    }

I can manage most of the formatting with sed, but I can't figure out how to create the duplicate entry for each header...

format:

    require ""something"" 
    if anyof (condition1, 
        condition2, 
        ...,
        condition40,
        not condition41) {

I mentioned that I want to be more on the Linux side of things, than Windows but in the position I am in, I'm required to do both. He's very keen on having more Linux admins in house as there are only a couple within the whole company and they struggle.



Now, the experience I've had with Linux goes as follows:


I've been using Mint on and off as my main OS at work for the last 6 months or so, but due to a problem between Mint and the proxy here, I am unable to use apt-get or the software centre to download packages, so I don't get a lot of chance to mess about with things.


I have a Rasbperry Pi which I SSH into using PuTTY from my main (Windows, damn gaming) machine at home. I do nothing more than change properties of text files and move/delete folders.


I ran a Minecraft server for a short while which my younger siblings/cousins and I used.




So basically I have nothing behind me in the way of actually using Linux.
I've read a lot of posts about setting up a linux network at home, I have a couple of old machines and my pi which I am going to use to build... something soon, I also have a domain which I can use so I'll try and set up something with that too.




But, I need to know more about training courses, which ones I should be looking at to fill up my CV. I'm Googling right now but I am pretty much lost.

Yet if I remove the $tennents1 from this example it provides the subnet the correct 512kbps, rather then a full link.

I have a 1TB external drive that is full...and not backed up. 

I need to build a file server and a backup one. I want it to be encrypted. I have five 2 TB disks but i don't even know how i should put them together yet. 

Originally, i was planning on RAID 5, but i heard that can go wrong pretty easily and catastrophically. 

**Edit**: Ok, thanks for the raid opinions! They're informative but not what i really need help with [=

Now, i'm thinking two servers, one being the backup (**edit**: maybe i'll get one more disk an have raid 5 + sync). I was thinking full disk encryption, but i don't want to have to be in front of the machine to unlock it, so i'm wondering: 

 * What is the best solution to have an encrypted folder or drive so that i'll still be able to log in remotely (as opposed to encrypting the whole system)? 

I can find smaller drives for the OS if that makes sense to have on a separate partition, so then i could have two servers with a small drive for the server and 2-3 drives for storage. If i do that: 

 * Which one should be bigger, backup or main? 
 * If it's backed up, is there a big downside to using soft raid 0 for the storage drives, and if not...how do i do that?

Lastly, i'd like to be able to access all of my files as if they were local. 

 * Is sshfs the best solution for that? 
 * Downsides to this approach?

Sort numerically.

Awk to remove the remote port and just show the source IP.

Uniq to consolidate all the IPs and just output the number of entries for an individual IP.

I don't really have a specific problem, for now I will just put all the files in /usr/local/bin even though the included files will not be needed to be in path. Would just be neat if there was a convention for this.

It's for Perl and bash scripts if that matters.

I've configured a Postfix mailserver. It's not quite in production yet. It does not have any domains or mailboxes configured, but there is one domain with its MX records pointed to it.

The server should accept incoming mail and send outgoing email that is generated internally (eg. by Apache). However, our clients will not send outgoing email through this server, hence none of the SASL auth stuff.

Here are the restriction lists I'm using:

    smtpd_client_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks,
        reject_unknown_client_hostname,
        reject_rbl_client zen.spamhaus.org,
        permit

    smtpd_helo_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks,
        reject_invalid_helo_hostname,
        reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname,
        reject_unknown_helo_hostname,
        permit

    smtpd_sender_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks,
        reject_non_fqdn_sender,
        reject_unknown_sender_domain,
        reject_unverified_sender,
        permit

    smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
        check_policy_service unix:private/checkquota,
        permit_mynetworks,
        reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
        reject_unauth_destination,
        check_policy_service unix:private/checkspf,
        permit

    smtpd_data_restrictions =
        reject_unauth_pipelining,
        permit

The checkquota service will return either REJECT or DUNNO (not OK/PERMIT or whatever it is).

The Postfix version is 2.3, so I'm unable to use smtpd_relay_restrictions if that matters.

Where $HOMEDIR is the home directory and $USERNAME is their username. We recenlty moved our NIS server to another server and when we did it was decided that instead of using /etc/passwd we would use a passwd file stored elsewhere which is supposed to be more secure, in this case we used /etc/yp/passwd. So there is the problem, useradd adds the user to /etc/passwd and nothing ever syncs to two passwd file. I've googled how to add users to NIS using alternate passwd files but all I ever get is to use useradd which isn't what I want. Now it seems like the easiest way to do this is to 

    adduser -g users -d $HOMEDIR $USERNAME

Hopefully someone here has some advice for me.

please can I get a view/opinions on how secure my setup is. I basically want to run python's SimpleHttpServer to expose one directory over the internet for file download.

For ssh I use shared keys.

I use fail2ban to prevent repeated ssh attempts.

Using ufw I've only enabled access for the ports for ssh and port 8000.

Some of the above isn't relevant for port 8000, but do you think it's okay for me to expose a folder for any amount of time to the world using python's SimpleHttpServer for file download?

either way, i was wondering if anybody had any suggestions for good self prep materials. i'll be using the [IBM LPI](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/lpi/) prep either way, and possibly [lpicprep.com](http://lpicprep.com/). what i'm really concerned about is stuff that's beyond many of the basics beyond what you'd experience at home.

i took the redhat placement quiz and they suggested putting me in the tier2 program, but i know for a fact that i'm way too unfamiliar with all but the most cursory aspects of networking in general, and specific to linux. i can do a bit of scripting, but don't have any real problems on any of my systems to solve so most of my educational made up scripting projects don't really have any meat and tend to go nowhere.

so, does anybody have any thoughts here? really looking for something substantive that i can spend the next couple/few weeks on.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________
I've got a ubuntu machine setup with the latest Net-SNMP 

    NET-SNMP version 5.4.1 AgentX subagent connected
    NET-SNMP version 5.4.1

I've retrieved the mibs from ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v2/ that are described here https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-1295

However, there are some of these that are not complete. For instance the SNMPv2-SMI that Cisco has on their FTP is not the same as the native SNMPv2-SMI from the Net-SNMP package. If I change them around the entire daemon will scream out for missing definitions in other areas. 

    Did not find 'zeroDotZero' in module SNMPv2-SMI (/usr/share/snmp/mibs/CISCO/IP-MIB.my)
    Did not find 'zeroDotZero' in module SNMPv2-SMI (/usr/share/snmp/mibs/DISMAN-EVENT-MIB.txt)
    Did not find 'zeroDotZero' in module SNMPv2-SMI (/usr/share/snmp/mibs/DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB.txt)


And if you check the Cisco provided SNMPv2-SMI it does indeed miss the zeroDotZero definition...

If I run along with the Net-SNMP versions of the MIB-files that Cisco mentions on their support-page, I get a working toolset... however...

Let's take an example of an instance that comes in through traps from an ASA and some tests;

It seems that SNMPv2-SMI is higher prioritized in the translations than the CISCO definitions. What can I do to circumvent this (/increase priority for cisco defs.)?

**Edit**: corrected SNMPv2-MIB to SNMPv2-SMI where appropriate.

**Edit2**: Wanted to inform you that I've now tested with just simply adding the zeroDotZero definition to the CISCO SNMPv2-SMI and it makes no difference. It's still preferring SNMPv2-SMI translation over CISCO's IPSEC-FLOW-MONITOR...

I've currently got one server that's hosting a website (a CMS using apache/php/mySQL) plus a bunch of other stuff-- svn, git, user homes, some of which is sensitive at, let's say **myserver.com**. In an effort to improve security, I'm moving the website to a separate server.

So I ultimately want http requests to **myserver.com** to end up at the web server, and everything else to end up at another server. I'd like to do this without breaking any existing links out there (from other sites, and also for svn/git).

So far, the options I've come up with are:

1. Move the webserver to *www*.**myserver.com**, and put an instance of apache on **myserver.com** that simply redirects everything to *www*.**myserver.com**.

2. Leave the webserver at **myserver.com**, and add rules to iptables to direct git/svn traffic to the other server (or vice-versa). This will have a performance hit for users, though, I should think.

Any thoughts? Am I going about this entirely wrong? It seems like this is something that should be handled at the TCP layer.

I'd like to know your opinion first.~~I've made the script and put it on github: https://github.com/miellaby/backunion ; Go and test it.

The main goal is to backup a bunch of home devices on a single home server (NAS) while handling the high level of duplicates I've got (pictures, mp3...).

It's somewhat related to a lot of clever solutions. Git-based tools, s3ql, lessfs, btrfs, etc. But they don't fit my needs. So here's the poor-man solution I'm thinking about.

It's mainly a union-fs merging an ""in-out"" directory and a read-only-flagged ""store/tree"" directory + a deduping script.

The deduping script combines ""find"", ""shasum"" and ""ln"" to dedup all files from ""in-out"" to ""store"". ""store/data"" contains all files renamed as their own shasums and ""store/tree"" folder all backuped files as hard links up to data files. 

Despite there are files moving from ""in-out"" to ""store/tree"", the union mount makes the process transparent from the end-user point of view. He can even modify backuped files in place. The copy-up feature of union mounts will prevent directly changing a deduped data file in the store with many hard links (and so avoid unwanted side effects).

The deduping script may be run on a hourly basis, at idle time, or been triggered by some activities. I don't know yet.

But more important: I expect the same script been able to work as well on client side (backuped computers) and server side (NAS).

First, one may build up the union mount on server side, and CIFS or FTP share it within the home network so to be usable by closed devices (Android, Windows, ...). Then one may run the deduping script on server side  (for example at nigh) to dedup anything which has been put directly onto the NAS through CIFS and FTP.

Second, one may run the deduping script on client side. To do so, the ""store"" directory is SSHFS shared as well. Then, any open device may perform the union-fs mount and run the backuping script on its side. It requires to mount the ""store"" directory over the network + build up the union mount between ""store"" and a local ""in-out"" path. And here we goes. 

Why running the deduping script on client side? because it will avoid sending twice the same 4GB files every time it is renamed or moved into an other folder. A use-case not handled by installing a deduping filesystem like btrfs on the file server.

A last note: Ive heard about issues when hitting directly directories merged by an union mount. But I've the feeling it will work in my case. edit: First tests confirm it works.

I am about to begin configuring a high-availability web cluster and in the past have used the solution found at the site below:

[How To Set Up A Loadbalanced High-Availability Apache Cluster](http://www.howtoforge.com/high_availability_loadbalanced_apache_cluster)

I am curious if there is a better option to use, as I have had issues with fail-over in the aforementioned setup.

Does anyone have a different method they use? This option will work for me, however, I am interested in more elegant options.

The issues I have with the above are during fail-over / server reboot. Fail-overs work _great_ if the primary load balancer fails, however, if I try to revert the primary and secondary roles, the load balancers lose the virtual IP. Also, during reboot, the heartbeat service will hang on either load balancer, causing the virtual IP to be unbound and my cluster lose connectivity. As a high-availability cluster, this really cannot occur.

Any suggestions?

They are much appreciated! Thanks.

I hope this is the right place and that I can convey myself properly. Our accounting software uses its own email client to send emails and alerts. However, it only works when using smtp port 25 and doesn't support encryption. 

I was thinking of setting up a simple smtp relay in-house. However, I am not familiar with the process. This would only have to relay outgoing emails from the one client (accounting server). All we need is to have any port 25 email/request from the client relayed to port 587 with user authentication. This way, we can send the now encrypted email to our Google domain to route to other domains. Is this feasible? Am I looking at the approach correctly? If so, how do I go about doing it?

This is what I have thus far:

    for i in `grep -iR ""mail deli"" /var/spool/exim/input/* | awk -F "":"" '{print $1}'| awk -F ""/"" '{print $7}'| cut -c 1-16`; do exim -Mvb $i | awk '/[STRING]/ {print $i}'; done

Everything works pretty much as intended except for the output. Since $i is the message ID, I thought that printing it every time it found [STRING] would work. Instead it prints lines that match the string from within the message body. I'm guessing that this behavior is caused by awk interpreting $i as the section of a string which it should be printing.

I've tried setting my key on the drive using both [stenc](http://sourceforge.net/projects/stenc/) and [setLTO4key](http://www.circlesoft.com/setltokey.c) but both of them return SCSI SPIN/SPOUT = 0x5.

Fixed!

The drive I'm using has space for multiple keys, so once I used stenc and specified the index location I wanted the key uploaded to it accepted the key and now shows the encryption status as on.

[UPDATE]

OK. I have a lot of experience with Linux V-Servers, and have never had a problem. That was because they each had a unique public IP and the host did too. This time around, we are setting up at Linode.com, and applied the V-Server (www.Linux-VServer.org) patch and assigned private IPs to each one, with the host having a public IP. We then set iptables to pass traffic through to the appropriate V-Server, and allow them to communicate with the Internet as if they had the public IP. We also used nginx to proxy serve http to the correct V-Servers and port forward where needed.

This seemed to be working well, until we ran into Postgres issues. I suspect other services would have issues too. This is because the host acts as a router, and therefore the iptables apply to the V-Servers too. We weren't expecting that.

So, I have been searching Google for a solution, because most certainly, someone has figured this out. Problem is, V-Servers are not as popular as other virtualization solutions. That's too bad - because THEY ROCK.

Looks like this is going to force us to move to a Xen based solution. Oh well.

If you are new to V-Servers, and wondering 'Why?' they are extremely light weight and efficient. If you have 10 V-Servers running on a host, and all are quiet, but one is getting hammered, that one gets almost ALL of the resources. Overhead is something like 1% per V-Server. There is no resource sharing/allocation per server.

Viewing them from the host, each is just a pair of folders on the file system. That makes migrating and backups/snapshots a breeze.

So, while all your advice below is appreciated, I left out the V-Server bit because I didn't think it mattered, and I was wrong. I am sorry about that. That is the root cause.

Having said all that, if someone out there knows how to resolve this using 1 public IP, and a private IP for each V-Server, I would REALLY appreciate it. Basically, I will then be able to have 10+ V-Servers running inside the cheapest Linode.com node, and upgrade that single node as required so they all benefit.

In my company I am responsible for doing configuration audits to make sure newly installed Linux servers are built following our documented standards. Because our build team does not always follow the standard and many of our existing servers are not in compliance I came up with a way to use GNU autoconf to provide me with a pass/fail representation to tell me what configuration does not meet our standards. 

So for example I use the following test to check if the wvdial package is installed:

AC_MSG_CHECKING([if wvdial is installed...])
rpm -qa |grep -q wvdial
if test $? -eq 0
then
        AC_MSG_RESULT([yes])
else
        AC_MSG_RESULT([no])
fi

which produces output such as:

checking if wvdial is installed...... no

With that being said, Network Edition comes with hot backups, but the open source edition, does not. I am having a little difficulty understanding any of the backup procedures for the open source edition. What I do understand is that the DB (MYSQL), message store and indexes must all be backed up. When looking at some of the scripts I've seen available online, it looks like there are some tools that zimbra has that makes this a little easier. 

What are your guys thoughts on backing up this information? I definitely do plan on doing a hell of a lot more research into this, but I guess I'm asking for you guys to point me in the right direction. The message stores seem simple enough to back up. I'm not familiar with the MYSQL backup, nor the backup of the indexes (provided through Lucene). The administrator's guide doesn't really touch on much. 

If you are familiar with any of this what are your best practices for backing up data and putting all back together during a restore?

I have had a home server set up for my web development work, and it has been working very well until recently. Here is my situation.

I have a server set up and use [no-ip.com](http://www.no-ip.com/) for DNS services. I have been using ssh to administer remotely, and sshfs to mount the files I am working on onto my laptop. This has all been working really well until recently.

The server is Ubuntu Server 10.04 and my local machine is openSUSE 12.1

Today the problem was particularly bad, every time I mounted my remote files with sshfs, after about a minute, whatever app I was using to edit text files would hang, and my terminal would have as soon as I typed in the folder name where the files were mounted and tried to do anything with that folder (such as cd into it, fusermount -u unmount it or even try to tab-complete the nae of the folder)

After this going on for a while, I replaced the domain name from no-ip.com with the local IP address (fortunately I was working from home today) and now it is as solid as a rock. 

Can anyone help me figure out why this is happening, or at least direct me to some resource where I can start t figure it out (I am not even sure what I should be searching for). I am not an admin, but I do need to keep my test server up and running for my web development work, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

[edit] I should add that I am not experiencing the same problem over port 80, only with 22

I've been working on replacing a few old Apple Xserves with a Linux server for the past few weeks for around ~1200 users with network homes on Mac clients.  This has historically been done using AFP.  I've been piloting netatalk for a few weeks with poor results, most of which aren't necessarily netatalk's fault:

- Case sensitivity (lots of Mac files are directories that may end up with duplicate files of different case (e.g. test Test), which doesn't gracefully transfer to the local Mac filesystem.
- POSIX ACL issues for group shares (inheritance isn't quite as expected) (see http://www.mattb.net.nz/blog/2007/07/09/posixnfsv4-acl-inheritance-problems/ for the issue described)

I'm seeking some ideas for a practical replacement.  Samba isn't out of the question.  NFS *might* be a little tricker from the Mac client's perspective.  These shares are automounted via LDAP and the homes are ""live"" (not 'synced' homes).  Most of the quirks experienced aren't necessarily related to network homes, but rather directories within a group share, where ACLs are required for the granular level of access desired.

This may be a broad question, but any input or ""what I would do"" is much appreciated.

**Update:**  I may be able to resolve the issues I have with netatalk's options for caseinsensitive and the 'upriv' options (umask, dperm, fperm).  I plan on documenting this publicly if anyone's interested in a similar setup.

I'm in the process of migrating several network user home directories to a Linux file server.  They're coming from various Mac OS X servers, where ACLs were used for rights.  In the past, for network homes on a Linux box, I wasn't too granular about permissions, etc.  However, these particular homes do need a certain level of that.

So what I'll have is a bunch of users all part of the same group.  In addition, I'll have the IT shop, which is a defined group.  I need the IT shop to have full, recursive rights to the users' data (for assistance, troubleshooting, etc).  With ACLs, I can set default permissions, but those don't seem to hold up if the user does a 'chmod 600' on a file, for instance.  My only thoughts there are to run a cron job nightly or so to ""fix"" the permissions.

The users' homes will be chmod 700.  Unfortunately, that trumps my ACL for the IT shop.  If I chmod 750, then everyone else in their group has access (unless I specifically deny them (is there an 'everyone' catchall?))

The simple ACL I've used for testing is:
    setfacl -d -R -m g:it_staff:rwx homes

It is HARD!,16,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/h6hbm/raid1_should_be_easy_it_is_hard/,"The Debian Squeeze installer allows for RAID setup, but then tries to install GRUB2 to /dev/sda instead of /dev/md0. So, I can't see how anyone can use the Debian installer to setup RAID.

Using other tools has issues too (below) but regardless, they reformat the partitions, so I end up running the Debian Squeeze installer again. When I try to 'skip' the partitioning, it complains because mount points have not been defined (rightly so) and forces me to redefine some of the settings for the partitions.

When I get Debian installed without RAID, and try to execute mdadm to create the RAID there, it complains that the partitions are in use. 

So, I try using Knoppix and running mdadm from a console. It refuses to allow a RAID array to be made for /dev/sda2 and /dev/sdb2 because they are 'not suitable for any style of array'. They are linux-swap. Further, for the Ext3 and Ext4 partitions, it warns me that they seem to be Ext2 and I am at risk of ... blah-blah-blah.

If I use gparted from the Knoppix CD, it uses MiB and can't do RAID. (It is a real pain using MiB in 1 tool, and MB in another) Further, it seems to assign /sda, /sdb, /sdc and /sdd randomly and I would like to know which physical drive is which. Even the UUIDs seems to change.

If I use the 'Disk Utility' on the Knoppix CD, it seems to want to create RAID before the partitions exist, which doesn't make sense. However, it does show the drive Serial Numbers, so I can determine the physical drives which is necessary when a drive does fail.

The list goes on and on. It has been days of effort with no results.

I think I am running into issues because Debian Squeeze is new, as I am using EXT4 on some partitions and GRUB2, each which may complicate things. I've even noticed things work differently with the Debian installer when using the character screen based installer vs the graphical installer. Wow.

This same task went much easier with Debian Lenny on another server. So, I considered doing the same on this one, and then upgrading to Squeeze. However, the Debian install CD I have is a non-free ISO, because of the proprietary network drivers needed for this server. I can't find the same non-free ISO for Lenny.

So, if someone can help me find a GOOD HowTo or provide some guidance, I would REALLY appreciate it.

I have a RHEL5 server that provides multiple NFS exports to my web, app, and db servers. The particular problem I'm having is, following a kernel update (2.6.18-348.3.1.el5) on the NFS server, one of the exports will not allow java executables to function. 

The Solaris servers in question are actually 5.9 based, non-global zones. While the servers can mount up the exports without issue, the application cannot utilize the scripts stored in one of the exports. The remaining exports (2 for application logging and 1 for web code [html, php, perl, etc]) function as they should. 

When launching the application, I receive a (somewhat generic) java error:

I have attempted to debug the issue through a variety of means - increasing debug level of NFS, running traces on NFSD, running traces on the application, tcpdump, and cannot obtain any further information that might aid me in resolving the issue. 

* I have forced the NFS server to only use version 3 and have added 'vers=3' to the mount in vfstab to ensure that it uses only NFS3. 

* The exports have had no_root_squash added to the options even though it was not previously required.

* The exports use 'anonuid=65534' and 'anongid=65534' as they did previously.

* I have verified that, when the export is mounted, I can read/write/execute files using the same user account used by the application.

In the meantime I have the copied the files off the NFS server to the Solaris servers so the scripts reside locally to the application running them, which works well, but makes it a pain to keep them in sync and roll new code.

That same SMTP server is also responsible for sending email from our domain (ourdomain.com) out to the internet from our web application.  Easy enough, already setup and working.

Unfortunately combining the two means when our application sends an email to @exampleA.com, Postfix thinks this is for local delivery and then drops it into the catch all.

Other than running up a second SMTP server, is there a way to say for any emails arriving from a specific source IP/network to immediately deliver to the internet instead of attempting to deliver locally?

I have a RHEL 6.2 cluster using RGMANAGER to handle failover of the SQUID resource.  While performing some backend iscsi LUN work we noticed that rgmanager was not behaving properly. Here are the session notes:

----------------------------------------------------------------
RGMANAGER was running on both nodes and a service group named ""squid"" was running on node 1. We tried to shut down the cluster on node 2, but it hung. Therefore, I rebooted the server. When node 2 came back up, everything was running except for RGMANAGER. I tried to start the RGMANAGER service, but it stated that the service was DEAD and that a lock file existed. I deleted the RGMANAGER lock file from /var/run and restarted the service without any errors only to find out that it had not started. I experienced the same issue on node 1.

Issues:

1) Cannot shut down cluster

2) Cannot failover service group ""squid"" (Most likely because of the issue with RGMANAGER)

3) ""Init 6"" did not work because it could not cleanly shut down services (Reboot was used instead)

4) RGMANAGER did not work following reboot

5) Starting RGMANAGER creates a lock file, which is not cleaned up on shutdowns.

Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks guys.

We currently are running mostly on Novell Netware 6.5, my servers range from a [Gateway 2000 NS-8000](http://i.imgur.com/NEVOdoW.jpg) from 1997 to a few newer (2009) HP's that are our storage servers. Our gateway and proxy server is on it's last leg along with most of the servers, networking equipment, PBX, etc. etc. etc. The district is faced with a 3 million dollar deficit next year and so every department is pretty much getting slashed (I'm going from four techs down to two). I'm currently the Director of Technology aside from wearing multiple other hats.

I was wondering if anyone had any experience or any suggestions for any open source platforms that could handle logging in from Windows XP/Vista/7 clients, iPads, shared network drives and also personal network drives, gateway/proxy/firewall. I'm looking to leverage Google Apps for Education to handle our email and bring in some collaborative tools the district has never had.

My experience with Linux is pretty much CentOS and Ubuntu Server/Desktop. This ranges from Mincraft and CS:S servers on Ubuntu to mail and web on Ubuntu and then to Asterisk on CentOS. I'm looking for something that has a web based GUI for management and can handle a multitude of users. Here are some details:

* Typically 1400 unique user accounts are made each school year, so the ability to do this in a batch would be a plus
* Each account has their own personal server space and then access to certain shared drives. Such as a server share between teachers and office staff for documents.
* Probably about 1600 users total, however we only have about 800 computers/devices in district. A large amount of these users only use Webmail (we currently use Novell GroupWise) from home because their job doesn't use a computer.

With some of the savings from the two soon to be unemployed technicians and what's currently left of my budget, I have about $50k to get a new proxy and I would also like to provide firewall services. I also would like to move off of Novell and onto another OS to replace it's current functions of authentication and storage. The only thing I've looked at so far is ClearOS, I'm just not sure it will be able to handle the amount of users I'm talking about.

Anyways, I know this is a wall of text and I haven't hit on everything yet, so any help is greatly appreciated and feel free to ask any questions. As you can probably tell from my limited explanation, I'm more than neck deep in it.

I would like to configure postfix to work with multiple domains (virtual domains).  Right now I have my DNS records pointed at my servers dedicated IP (still hosted with current host).  Is there something I need to do to tell postfix to use that domain other than in main.cf?

I have been googling a lot, I am certainly learning but this is something I need to fasttrack if possible.  My current hosting ends very soon.  I need to completely transition off.

What should my MX record look like?  Should I have anything else in there with DNS?  I have MX records setup and the domains point to their virtual host on that server, I just wonder about txt files in the records.

I was able to send mail, but it looked funky (user@hostname) no .com or domain.com.  I can not receive mail.  I tried fixing that, now I cant even start the postie service.  I am using webmin.

Secure a position at another company, doing 1st, 2nd and 3rd Line support for even less money (absolute peanuts)

About two weeks later; working my notice period at the 1st line job, day off, get a call from a Linux focused recruitment agency ""We've got a position we think you'd be perfect for."" Phone calls back and forth between the agency, employer and myself. 20 minutes later ""I know it's a bit short notice, but could you possibly come in for an interview tomorrow?""

Attend the interview, greeted by the three current Sys Admins working there. Laugh at the guys 'you &gt; /dev/null' t-shirt - it's going well already. For the first time in my life, I get to talk to people face to face about my passion and my hobby, but in terms of making a career out of it. Nail the 'technical' questions, sail through the rest, meet the company's CEO, such a nice guy.

Just walking to the car after getting off the train back in my hometown, phone call. After a few minutes of feedback ""Great news, they'd like to offer you the position!""
 

**tl;dr** - Absolutely crazy, awesome, beautiful 24 hours. I went from a job I hate, and have been stuck in far too long, to securing a position at a great company, in an incredible vibrant city, for much better pay, doing what I love.

Not just another job, the start of my career.

So, my question to those experienced in Linux or Unix Systems Administration, is really just - what advice do you have for a young, passionate Linux hobbyist who's delving into this sort of work?",,False,,t5_2r9lc,False,,,True,t3_17r3v3,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/17r3v3/so_i_just_landed_my_first_linux_orientated_job/,

My forte is in Debian and RHEL, and I'm at a loss as to why patches would cause everything to remain working, but at a hindered rate, or rather why I/O going to the fiber connected drives eats the CPU alive.

There was a firmware update for the fiber cards, which I applied to no success.  I'm at the end of my knowledge of Solaris at this point, and if anyone has suggestions on which direction to take this, I'd appreciate some input.

Edit:

Oracle sent me off to have EMC check their portions.  EMC came back clean.  I got bounced to a different tech with Oracle and it looks like a few things.  There's apparently a memory allocation issue with Oracle (the database) that the DBA is looking into correcting, and there's also a bug in how some systems handle memory page coalescing (taking sparse smaller pages and shuffling memory to make a large enough spot for a large page request).

I am working on RHEL 6.2 and network runs fine with the present configuration. 
While testing some new network files with different ip addresses, which includes some extra ""bond"" files, 
after I restart the network and do ""ifconfig"" it shows the new ip address and bond files(it is only for testing, so network does not has to work).
 
BUT when I revert back to the original network configuration, the ifconfig shows 
BOTH the ""bond"" network configuration and also the original network configuration, 
while there is only orignal ""ifcfg-eth0"" file present in the network-scripts - 
which is right but the network does not work and also I have to reboot the machine to make the present ifcfg-eth0 effective :

I'd like to make sure I do not need to adjust queue depths for my SAN disks.

On that topic has anyone ever experienced operations like using rm to remove several hundred files taking forever to complete?  I let it run to around 45min before I broke out.  Something seems very weird.  I found some info on a bug report but I'm not sure it applies to us b/c of the version we're on.  If anyone has any input please throw it my way.  I'd especially love to talk to anyone who admins RHEL in an IBM SVC env.

**Server Info**

Distro: Arch Linux

Web Server: NginX 1.0.15

Libraries:

* PHP - 5.3.10

* Perl - 5.14.2

* Python - Python 3.2.2

* Ruby - 1.9.3p125

Up until now, we've been the only users allowed in the server, and we haven't had any issues. But recently the need for the client to have access to their files have come up and we're having some issues trying to figure out how to secure the server.

So for starters, I created a sftp chroot environment for the user and only gave them access to their home folder.
    
Currently this is how our folder structure is laid out.

***/srv/***

    drwxrwx--x 15 root  adm   1024 Apr 30 00:54 http


***/srv/http/***

    drwxrwxr-x  4 http [site group ex. examplecom] 1024 Feb  6 20:42 [site ex. example.com]

***/srv/http/example.com***

    drwxrwxr-x  2 http [site group ex. examplecom] 1024 Apr 24 13:38 logs
    
    drwxrwxr-x  2 http [site group ex. examplecom] 1024 Apr 24 13:38 public_html

This structure worked for us, it was organized and simple. But now that we have clients allowed to enter the server, we need to find a way to secure each site folder.

So one idea was to put each site folder in the home folder of each user. So the layout will look something like this:

***/*** (I'm not going to show everything)

    drwxrwx--x   7 root adm   1024 Apr 29 21:51 home

***/home/***

    drwxrwx--x   2 root root   1024 Apr 30 00:54 [user]

***/home/[user]***

    drwxr-xr-x   2 http [site group ex. examplecom] 1024 Feb 6 20:42 [site ex. example.com] 

And the rest will look similar to ""/srv/http/example.com"". The user folder is root:root because they are chrooted. 

This seems to work, and it prevents http from accessing ""/home"" and ""/home/user"". But the case if the user knows the user name and the site that falls under the user name, then the user can easily create a script with php or any of the libraries and access other sites by having that correct path.

Is there a solution to this problem?

As mentioned above, the user is sftp chrooted, but there is a chance that a future client might need ssh access. 

Also, the ""site group ex. examplecom"", each domain has a group and that group is assigned to each domains folder. Each user has a the group added to them, so if client_a had access to ""example.com"", they will have the group ""examplecom"".

If there is any more information needed or if something needs to be clarified, please ask. 

EDIT: If any one is curious, this is what the folder structur looks like now.

***/srv/***

    drwxr-x--x 15 root  adm   1024 Apr 30 00:54 http


***/srv/http/***

    drwxr-x--x  4 root adm 1024 Feb  6 20:42 [site ex. example.com]

I have a line like this:

Problem is, for some reason what the second script receives is:

    /path/to/script -a $arga -b $argb -c ""value_of_arg1"" ""value_of_arg2""

I've been able to work around it by doing something like this:

    newarg=""$arg1 $arg2""
    /path/to/script -a $arga -b $argb -c ""$newarg""

Why does this happen?  I've tried many combinations of quotes and escaping quotes...this is the only workaround I came up with.  Unfortunately I have another script where this is causing an issue and it is not fixable by this same workaround.  Can this behavior be turned off somehow?

**EDIT**
I guess I didn't explain it well enough... I'm calling a KSH script from another KSH script. I need an argument to have two parameters. I.E.  -c ""Parameter1 Parameter2""...so that when I process the arguments the string ""Parameter1 Parameter2"" is associated with -c

So when I try this line in the first script to call the second script:

    /path/to/script -a $arga -b $argb -c ""$arg1 $arg2""

It puts quotes around arg1 and 2 for some reason I can't figure out...so essentially the string that calls the second script looks like this...I have verified this with -x:

    /path/to/script -a $arga -b $argb -c ""$arg1"" ""$arg2""

This is bad because when I process the arguments only the first arg is associated with -c and arg2 is not.

My Linux experience is very limited, but it's also not my first time using a CLI. I've used Ubuntu on a couple machines from time to time. Used to have to do some software installs on Linux when I was a software consultant. In general, I know the basic concepts of it.  Which leads to me trying something - google for ten minutes - try something else. Rinse and repeat.

    CentOS 5.6
    PHP 5.3.6
    Apache 2.2.19
    MySQL 5.0.92-community
    Perl 5.8.8

Development machine:

    Ubuntu 10.04LTS
    Minimal GUI install
    Complete physical access plus SSH and VNC

I have two questions.

**One:**

How close does the production and development software really have to match? My initial thought was it would be best to put the same version of Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

We run small Joomla and WordPress sites and a couple Magento.

If they don't really need to match then it gets rid of question two.

**Two:**

How does one install older versions of software. Specifically, that older version of MySQL. Now, I know I should have them upgrade and I will be talking to them.

My only experience with getting software is from the package manager. That version is not in the repository. I tried to download the .rpm and use alien to convert it to a .deb and install it. It installed, but doesn't work.

IMHO I think may be a driver error is going on, but don't know how to figure it out.

I'm having some strange troubles with this server which is based on a supermicro motherboard.

The server runs red hat linux.

The server ""hangs"" when I do ""ifconfig eth2 down"" , also with eth3.

This eth2 and eht3 belong to a new pci card added last week.

Eth0 and eth1 are integrated on the motherboard and they work with igb driver. Eth2 and eth3 are the new ones on a pci and depends on e1000e driver.

Eth0 is configured as follows and is working fine.

    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=10.0.16.49
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    NETWORK=10.0.16.0
    HWADDR=00:xx:xx:xx:xx:5c

Eth1 is configured as follows and is working fine.

    DEVICE=eth1
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=192.168.16.46
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0

Eth2 and eth3 have been configured in many ways, but to figure out which can be the problem I've connected them(one by one) to a network with dhcp, then call dhcpclient eth2 or eth3, and when ifconfig down the computer still hangs. So IMHO the configuration does not matter.

The modprobe.conf file looks as follows:

    alias eth0 igb
    alias eth1 igb
    alias scsi_hostadapter ahci
    install vtune_drv /opt/intel/vtune/mknod_vtune.sh
    remove vtune_drv /opt/intel/vtune/rmnod_vtune.sh
    alias char-major-10-111 mdm

igb and e1000e modules are loaded and I can see them with lsmod. If anyone would like to take a look to the lsmod output can do it here --&gt; http://pastebin.com/jJ7kk8mn

what lspci shows on ehternet is at follows (2 first eth are eth0 and eth1)

    01:00.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82576 Gigabit Network Connection (rev 01)

As an intermediate Linux user and former organizer, I have often sought out beginner level guides to executing security measures.  Unfortunately, these guides don't exist on an enterprise level.  Obviously, this is because there is a steep learning curve, which requires hundreds of hours of education.  Most often I am told that if I don't understand it, I shouldn't be doing it.

There are many reasons why a novice or intermediate user might require access to enterprise level security.  For example, activists and many non-profits rely on a do-it-yourself milieu due to a lack of funding and resources.  With all that has happened over the past ~5 years between governments and activists around the world, information security and anonymity can be of the utmost importance.  I intend to create a website geared towards novice to intermediate computer users that will walk them through effectively executing enterprise level security, crypto-anarchy, and anonymity.

Here are some questions I have for reddit.

A. Mandatory Access Control

I read this page explaining [hardened Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/).  I do not understand any of it.  I have so many questions.  Here are a few.

1.  From a security standards standpoint, which of these three mandatory access control patches provide the most thorough security; SELinux, AppArmor, or Grsecurity?

2.  Are there any other software packages that should be considered that enhance security beyond these kernel patches?

3.  Are there any beginners guides on proper implementation and configuration of these three kernel patches?

B.  Firewalls

I am aware of iptables.  I have a few questions regarding this too.

1.  Is there a front-end to iptables that makes its vast features apparent and easily configurable?

2.  How can you configure iptables to work as a whitelist?

3.  Are there any good beginners guides for configuring iptables?

C. Crypto-anarchy

I am aware of LUKS, dm-crypt, GPG, &amp; Truecrypt.  Here are my questions regarding crypto-anarchy:

1.  Mathematically speaking, what is the most advanced encryption scheme dm-crypt is capable of?  That is to say, what cryptsetup settings will ensure the most secure encryption over the longest period into the future?

2.  Are there any Linux based chat/voice/video conferencing programs that don't rely on 3rd party servers such as Google or Microsoft, and provide encryption?  Software that requires you or someone you know to host a server is acceptable.

3.  What are the most polished GPG front-ends?

I decided eventually to stick with SNI, because most browsers support it, and the ones that don't are outdated and the site probably wouldn't display properly in them anyway.

Well, there was one thing I overlooked: GoogleBot apparently doesn't support SNI, because within a few days of switching to HTTPS, the descriptions and titles of each site matched those of the first one (sorted alphabetically) hosted on the server.

This is a massive problem, but I figured it would be easy to fix: just **exclude** the Googlebot from the ""redirect everything to https"" rule. So I added this to the vhost file:

    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !(.*)(Google)(.*)

    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off

Next question: when I add a HD to a VM I can run the command 'echo ""- - -"" &gt; /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/scan' to have the new device(s) show up in /dev without needing to reboot. 

When I remove a device, I run the same command but it does not remove the devices nor any partitions I may have made from /dev. 

Is there a command I can run that will let me do this without needing to reboot?

Thanks! 

--------------------

EDIT: Thanks for the replies everyone, up votes for all as usual. Partprobe is what I have come across and what is recommended by Jang but in my experience it is not removing the device after I've run it, i.e. 'ls -l /dev/sd*' will still show /dev/sdb even after i have removed it from the VM and run partprobe. 

I like the sound of IAmSnort's suggestion so I will give that a go later on today and report back. 

Glad to be of help SomniSmith :) help me help you help me? :D

-------------------

EDIT2: To clarify I was practicing my LVM skills using a VM. My intention was to add a disk to the VM, have it show up in the guest, parition it, make a logical volume out of it, mount it and put some data on it, add another disk and extend the logical volume, remove the second disk and shrink the logical volume, remove the logical volume entirely, then delete the paritions on the two disks and remove them from the system (so that they don't show up under /dev/sd*, all without rebooting. 

The part that was confusing me was the removing of the devices from the virtual machine so as they would no longer show up under /dev/sd*. 

To that end I can confirm two things. One, don't be an egg like me, delete your paritions before you remove the disk from the VM, that way you'll at least get rid of any partitions showing up under /dev. Two, even after you have removed the partitions and removed the disks from the VM, you will still see /dev/sdb and/or /dev/sdc present in /dev. I can confirm that to get rid of them without rebooting, follow IAmSnorts advice and blow them away with the command 'echo 1 &gt; /sys/block/sdX/device/delete', that will do the trick.

I'm in the process of researching how to safely restore an mdadm array after reinstalling the OS.  I was greeted by numerous comments saying that it'll all be detected flawlessly due to the fact that each drive in the array has a Linux Raid Autodetect partition.

I decided to confirm this for my array and done a quick ""mdadm --detail /dev/md1"" to get my device names, and then fdisked each drive and checked that it had an autodetect partition. 4 out of the 5 drives did.  The remaining drive has no partition at all, but my raid array is definitely functioning correctly and has been successfully rebuilt quite a few times.  

I'm assuming that this is going to cause a bit of a problem when I try to assemble the array on a new system.  Am I correct? and if so, is there any possible fixes short of failing the device, partitioning it and then rebuilding it back into the array (raid 5 array).

There's one thing not working as it should though. When a spam email comes in (for example, the GTUBE spam test), the following happens:

- Message is passed to Amavis

- Amavis passes to SpamAssassin

- SpamAssassin sends it back to amavis, tagged as spam

- Amavis (?) adds ""\*\*\*SPAM***"" to subject

- Email is delivered, lands in inbox

I verified this in the mail log.

That's not the ideal solution, though. I'm looking for it to be sent straight to the junk folder (instead of adding ""\*\*\*SPAM***"" to subject)

Debian + Poweredge server = no love,10,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/z5klr/install_failing_debian_poweredge_server_no_love/,"Having some issues installing Debian on this server. I'm in the process of trying to convert my company from an old version of Fedora to a newer cleaner version of Debian, issue is that the install keeps failing. I get anywhere from 1/4 way to 1/2 way through the install process and then I start to get a message saying that the CD-ROM cannot be read and to check the integrity of the CD. I have swapped and reburnt the CD 3 times as well as using a different program to burn it and a different image (6.0.5 standard and 6.0.5 + nonfree). The furthest I was able to get was to where it started to load the actual install files then I had to swap out to the non-free version due to the NIC and the SCSi drives, since the swap over I can't even get half way through the OS load before it craps out. I'm leaning towards a potentially faulty CD Rom drive, but before I go there I wanted to see if anyone here has had similar issues with older hardware. In addition to this I am also having issues getting it to see the SCSi drives. It will find the Raid for the data container, but cannot see the raid for the OS drives (4 drives are in the data store, 2 are in the OS raid). When I pull all the drives for the data store it says cannot locate any drives to install the OS.

Edit: Ok so It appears that the solution put forth by phrstbrn did the job of solving my CDROM issues. Now the problem is the Disk drives. My system is not seeing the OS drives. I am almost wondering if it is because they are brand new disks and have no formatting on them at all. I'm going to try to get a live Cd to boot and see If I can find them at all. If not I'm unsure how to go about formatting them since they are SCSI ad I don't really have a USB&gt;SCSI adapter hanging around....I have tried the 3 AIC-7xxxx Drivers that are on the disk, but still no love yet. But I am a step closer!

TL:DR Debian 6.0.5 i386 non-free install failing on Dell Poweredge 4600.

Edit 2: I was finally able to get the install to happen. The last piece of the puzzle was the RAID controller in BIOS. There were 3 options. RAID, Off, and SCSI. I had to set this to SCSI to get the disks to be seen by the install. Once I did this I was able to create the MDADM and set up my mirror as I needed. But as I rebooted into the server I realized I screwed up and installed the GUI. Picturing back to the screen that asked what packages to install I realize that I had the desktop selected along with my other packages. So I need to verify if I can just remove the GUI and still have it a clean install, or if I need to now uninstall and reinstall for my clean install to not be cluttered with unneeded packages.

I'm very new to git, but my work wants to move to it from svn. Git is already setup on the Debian server and was working using shared keys. I have to move it to Apache for our other offices. My first step was to clone the svn repository (they want history). So I ran:

git svn clong http://svnrepo/ and it went perfectly. At this point I can access git via Apache no problem. The problem comes when I add user access. I don't want to give full rw access to the world. So I created a simple .htpasswd file for basic authentication. However, it's when I turn it on that I run into a strange problem.

A couple of questions related to one theme: downloading efficiently with Rsync.  
  
Currently, I move files from an 'upload' folder onto a local server using rsync. Files to be moved are often dumped there, and I regularly run rsync so the files don't build up. I use '--remove-source-files' to remove files that have been transferred.  
  
1) the '--delete' options that remove destination files have various options that allow you to choose when to remove the files. This would be handly for '--remove-source-files' since is seems that, by default, rsync only removes the files after all files have been transferred, rather than after each file; Othere than writing a script to make rsync transfer files one-by-one, is there a better way to do this?  
  
2) on the same problem, if a large (single) file is transferred, it can only be deleted after the whole thing has been sucessfully moved. It strikes me that I might be able to use 'split' to split the file up into smaller chunks, to allow each to be deleted as the file downloads; is there a better way to do this?

*Basically it's a beefed up re-purposed desktop virtualized using XenServer as the host OS and my DroboFS (NAS) for storing all the disk images and installation ISO's. Here's the story:*

After a week of troubleshooting this stupid repurposed HP desktop(didn't want to boot anything), I finally got it to boot off a USB drive with the XenServer installer loaded on it via UNetBootIn and install to the main HD.

Now I've got a virtualized server host installed, the XenCenter(management software) up and running(on a Windows VM through VirtualBox off my Ubuntu Desktop because it never dawned on the stupid citrix folks never conceived a sysadmin would be using anything else) and installing the shiny new copy of Debian Squeeze onto virtual hard drives hosted directly off my 4.5GB DroboFS which also hosts my disk image library so I can install new from whatever ISO's I have on my Drobo.

This is something I've been wanting/trying to do for way too long and it all snapped together tonight. Eventually my website and email server and all that will be moved over to it, plus I want to try out an OpenVPN server with Wikid 2-Factor Auth. Hell yeah.

Is there a way, via the preseed file, that I can change the contents of the sources.list to a local mirror, much like a regular CD install would do?

Thanks in advance. 

EDIT: It looks like I can run a post-install script where I can replace the sources.list with one of my choosing/design via wget.

I'm consulting for a company that  recently had a major staff change, leaving hundreds of poorly-documented, misconfigured systems, and they've contracted me to help clear up some of their ""mysteries."" 

One such mystery is their mail scanner. They have postfix+Spamassassin+Mailscanner running on a CentOS 5.8 vm, configured to save quarantined emails as postfix queue files. When one follows the normal procedure for releasing a mis-identified email, postfix appears to pick up the mail, and logs that it sent it to the Exchange server, but the email seems to disappear, never to be seen again. So they have been manually saving attachments and sending them to the recipient. I don't know much about the Exchange Server (think it's Windows Server 2008), and don't have access to it.

Does anyone have an idea what the issue would be, or where else I should be looking? There aren't any errors in the logs that would indicate where the mails are going.

I think BorkedHelix is right, I omitted that column because all the amounts were the same but I will investigate more.  I don't want to cron free -m and have it run separately because then it will take me longer to graph the reports.  

**Final edit:** This was actually really easy, I woke up this morning and figured it out, you just need to get the total memory (cat /proc/meminfo) then subtract the cached + buffered memory to see how much memory is *actually* being committed.  This problem arose because there is an older version of sysstat running which does not have the %commit column but it's not my server so I am unable to upgrade the package.

In excel the solution is =(total memory - (kbcached + kbbuffered)).

I'm having a bit of trouble getting it to work ""properly"". I'm posting this in r/linuxadmin because I think this is now a PAM issue, rather than a programming issue. I'm using RHEL5.

For starters, this is my /etc/pam.d/php file:

    # /etc/pam.d/php
    #
    # note: both an auth and account entry are required
 
    # Account entry verifies user id
    account sufficient      pam_unix.so audit
 
    # auth entry verifies password
    auth    required      pam_unix.so audit nodelay use_first_pass
    #auth     sufficient      pam_permit.so
 
    # session logs entry
    session sufficient      pam_unix.so audit


When I try to authenticate a user, I get the following error returned from PAM.

&gt; Error: Authentication information cannot be recovered (in pam_authenticate)

The /var/log/security file indicates the following:

&gt; Jul 22 10:37:01 testsrv httpd: pam_unix(php:auth): auth could not identify password for [seq]

I know that this is the correct service file (opposed to 'httpd') as commenting out the 'auth required pam_unix' line and enabling 'auth sufficient pam_permit.so' allows a successful login with a valid username (but it doesn't verify the password, obviously).

[The documentation](http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pecl/pam/trunk/README?view=markup) for the module indicates the issue is probably due to /etc/shadow being unreadable. If I chmod /etc/security to 644, then I can properly log on if I enter a correct user/pass combination. I've done this on my dev server to allow me to work on other things, but I obviously don't want to do that on a production server. If I read the PAM documentation correctly, I shouldn't need to. pam_unix.so calls /sbin/unix_chkpwd to verify the password, which is setuid root to specifically avoid this issue.

I can't figure out why something like gnome-screensaver, which is a non-suid application can log in with no problem, but php can't (Yes, I've tried copying gnome-screensavers's session file for php use).

Judging from the output of iotop it seems that rsync and MySQL are competing for disk access.  I'm already using ionice to give rsync the lowest priority, which helps a little bit.  My rsync commands look something like this:

ionice -c2 -n7 rsync -a --delete /home /mnt/backup-home

I've got an issue that I can't seem to work out despite bashing away at it and researching it to the best of my abilities. 

I have a nagios server set up and configured with gnokii. Everything appears to be working fine, I can send texts via command line etc, but when I attempt to trigger a text via nagios I get the following in my logs:

&gt;May 14 16:16:23 apnagios01 nagios: SERVICE NOTIFICATION: charles;c_xxx;Wordpad;CRITICAL;notify-service-by-sms;wordpad.exe: not running

If I then take the &gt; /usr/bin/printf ""%b"" ""Nagios - PROBLEM : C_XXX.ABC.COM/Wordpad is CRITICAL IP: c_xxx.abc.com ($OUTPUT$)"" | /usr/bin/gnokii --sendsms +61499084239 

section of that message and plonk it into bash, it executes immediately, it certainly doesn't take 30 seconds. 

Does any one have any idea why this is only timing out when nagios tries to execute it?

A basic view of our setup: It's a university web farm, and I basically have a series of virtualized nodes that just run Apache, and serve data from an NFS4 mount. The NFS mount is served from a dedicated hardware file server. 

We've had this happen once on both of our file servers now, but basically from one of our nodes I can traverse the file system of the NFS mount, but anytime I try to read a file, it just hangs indefinitely. On the file server, I can walk through the files and read them just fine. Restarting NFS does nothing. In an act of desperation, I rebooted the file server, and when it came back up, NFS was fine. Before I believe I was able to restart rpcbind to get it to come back, but sadly I had forgotten that until after I had rebooted.

I crawled through the logs on everything, but there is literally nothing there. In fact, nothing was logged form about 10 minutes before the problem, until I restarted NFS.

Any idea what the problem might have been, so I can prevent it in the future?

UPDATE:
In case anyone's google search brings this up, we were running linux kernel 3.2, and it appears that there is some nfs weirdness from 3.2-3.5, so we're upgrading to 3.9 this weekend, and suspect this will fix it.

I'm actually in the process of implementing a network access control solution at work (45 sites, 44 sites with around 15 users and one main site with 70 users). It's a great and interesting project, and we chosed to use packetfence (debian or centos, it's still in discussion) in order to achieve this goal.

I already have a running simulation using virtual machines and some spare hardware: it works like a charm, but I was wondering, as we are also implementing a per-site proxy solution (squid, with logs centralized via syslogs), if it'll be more interesting to deploy packetfence within the proxy solution on a per-site basis (which allow us to do inline enforcement, as some hardware used on site can be a bit old), or to use a centralized solution on main site (and ditch older switches for new ones on sites requiring it: no inline enforcement on routed vlans, sadly). 

Personnally, I tend to prefer the per-site solution, as it allows us to adapt our NAC solution to site's specificities while avoiding to invest in new hardware, and also being less dependant to the NAC solution (if it fails on one site, it'll not fail for the entire organization), but it implies a lot more configuration, and thus, time (which however can be done while preparing the squid machines), but do you think a global solution (with two machines, one used as spare in case of failure) is possible?

Thanks in advance for your advices, and please excuse any mistakes in this post as english is not my mother's tongue.

What I'm after is a client/server type tool that allows me to send status messages from the various configuration tools/scripts back to a central server, so that on the central server I can do something like 'cluster webfarm1.blahblah status' and it will show me what the last message each server sent was.  I don't want anything active, no ping checks, etc, just something that, when I launch a new cluster, I can quickly check to see if all the members completed their puppet config properly, and are up and running.  Ideally, I'd also be able to do something like 'server server1.webfarm1.blahblah history' and see all the messages logged by a particular server.  

I started to whip something up with NC, but I'm a horrible horrible 'coder', and am really hoping someone knows of a project like this, or that could be used for this.

I'm fairly new to Xen, so I'm trying to teach myself as much as I can. Earlier, I was finally able to launch a working Windows7 32bit instance running as a domU! I am able to connect to it over VNC just fine, but now I want to add internet connectivity. I am finding a lot of sample configurations, an many of them mention the use of bridging, but I'm not entirely sure what I setup should be using... But first, a little about my current setup.

My server (Debian squeeze x64), has a single physical ethernet interface:

    name: eth0
    ip: xx.yy.zz.200
    gw: xx.yy.zz.1
    mask: 255.255.255.0

This interface is aliased into 3 other interfaces:

    names: eth0:1, eth0:2, eth0:3
    ip: xx.yy.xx.201, 202, 203 (respectively)
    gw: xx.yy.zz.1
    mask: 255.255.255.0

Given my unique (with respect to the many tutorials I've read) situation, here are my questions;

* Should I be using a bridge?
* Should I give the bridge an IP of 192.168.1.???
* Should I give the bridge an IP of xx.yy.zz.??? (.{201-203}, or maybe a .204?)
* Can I scrap the bridge, and just use eth0:{1,2,3} directly?

If anyone has any suggestions, they would be much appreciated. Thanks!


**======== UPDATE ========**


I was able to get connectivity working, and here are the details of my final setup.

Here is what Xen appears to do on boot:

* **Renames** my physical ethernet interface `eth0`, to `peth0`.
* **Creates** a bridge named `eth0`.
* Assigns the ip address (`xx.yy.zz.200`) defined under the `eth0` entry in `/etc/network/interfaces` to the `eth0` bridge.
* Associates the physical `peth0`interface with the `eth0` bridge interface.

Here are the relevant entries in `/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp`

    (network-script network-bridge)
    (vif-script vif-bridge)

Here are the relevant entries in my `/etc/xen/win7-32.cfg`

    vif = ['ip=xx.yy.zz.201, bridge=eth0']

I also had to configure Windows with the same static IP (`xx.yy.zz.201`) that's defined in my `/etc/xen/win7-32.cfg`

Aliased interfaces (`eth0:2`, `eth0:3`) are defined normally.

When you launch a domU, Xen also creates a handful of `iptables` FORWARD rules, and associates the `vifN.0` and `tapN.0` interfaces with the `eth0` bridge.

And lastly, a protip; Don't `ifconfig &lt;bridge interface&gt; down` when it's associated with `&lt;only physical interface&gt;` while over SSH!",,False,,t5_2r9lc,1343775788.0,,,True,t3_wuwf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/wuwf2/xen_internet_connectivity_with_aliased_interfaces/,

I have been working with our mail ""server"" for the past month and a half now and it just gives me headaches since it's so cobbled together and so disorganized that I finally made the suggestion, well insistence, that we blow away what we have, rebuild and move forward with a much cleaner and more importantly, documented mail solution. I have been looking at various solutions and wanted to see what the community's suggestions would be. 

My environment: CentOS 5.4
Most outside emails currently being handled by Gmail and being pulled in using a fetchmail file. (we can create an address locally and it will route mail from the outside such as a jobs@xxxx.com and point it to an internal user for delivery)
Internal emails routed locally and not handled by gmail. 
Dovecot responsible for delivery to the EU. 
Outlook client pulling from server over a SSH connection created by an additional program so we map it as 127.0.0.1 for SMTP and POP3. 

I was thinking that the choices we have are simply ditching our internal server setup and setting up a relay on our server so it sends and receives all messages from gmail, or rebuilding our internal mail server so it is clean and trackable. I have been looking over dovecot, sendmail, and postfix. So far I am starting to see the way they can tie in with gmail, but still fuzzy on the details.

I used to run a Linux server that hosted several sites, and of course it was all done through SSH and command line and config files. That took up a lot of my time, and most of my time now is spent on my school and on my company. So what I'm looking for is an easy way to do just a few things with a VPS; they are:

* Host a few sites, about 4
* Have email addresses, mostly ones that just forward to other accounts
* Maybe host a Ventrilo server or Minecraft for fun (not too important)
* Personal use VPN (maybe)

I recall using an SQL Admin tool that made things very easy. Of course, installing PHPMySQL works too, I guess. Then I heard about RApache, which looks like it can create the virtual servers for multiple sites. I'm just not sure what to do about easy email forwarding set-up, I guess.

I'd also appreciate any tools that allow me to avoid SSH and config files, either that I can install on the VPS or on my Mac to command the VPS remotely.

I'm a little afraid of webmin, but this theme makes it look appealing http://code.google.com/p/webmin-theme-stressfree/. Is that my answer to everything? When I did the webmin demo I couldn't find email forwarding.

I got everything working except the mail server. I'm using linode to host my vps and I've been following their tutorials. FYI, I'm using Ubuntu 11.10.

I got up to the part where it tells me to restart dovecot, so I tried ""service dovecot restart"". But then I get this ""restart: Unknown instance:"". I'm logged in as root, so I'm not using sudo.

Since that didn't work I tried ""/etc/init.d/dovecot restart"" and I get ""dovecot start/running, process 4760"". So I try ""/etc/init.d/dovecot status"" and I get ""dovecot stop/waiting"".

So I tried ""service dovecot start"" and I get ""dovecot start/running, process 4781"". So I tried to get the status, so I tired ""service dovecot status"" and got ""dovecot stop/waiting""

Then I tired ""/etc/init.d/dovecot start"" and I get ""dovecot start/running, process 4794"". So I tired to get the status, so I tired ""/etc/init.d/dovecot status"" and got  ""dovecot stop/waiting""

Just for kicks and giggles I tired to kill the process, I used the PID that I got when I did ""service dovecot start"", this was the command ""kill -9 4444"" and I get this ""bash: kill: (4805) - No such process""

Am I doing something wrong?

I am building a server that could be used to automate deploying CentOS to other machines over the network.

So far I downloaded the whole install tree from rsync://ftp-stud.fht-esslingen.de/centos/6.0/os/x86_64

Then configured NFS for this and made ks.cfg file.

Tested my configuration using the netinstall image and things went okay but still the process isn't automated, I first have to edit the kernel line to tell it about the NFS server then the installer asks me to confirm partitioning the HDD.

But I am kinda stuck regarding PXE as the documentation of RHEL/CentOS are lacking clear details.

So anyone did such thing recently? How can I do that cleanly?

The /etc/exports in the server contains only this line: /shares	*(ro,sync)

And ks.cfg: http://pastie.org/2871681

Also bare in mind that DHCP is handled by the ADSL router, how can I avoid conflict between the router and server?

In addition I want to make an update mirror so all servers can be updated local from this master server.

The servers basically should act as Xen hosts. Too bad that RHEL/CentOS 6 dropped Xen for KVM. How can I make installing and configuring Xen in these servers automated? Should I write a script that do that and put it in post-install section of ks.cfg?

Thanks :)

I am the IT support for a small company and moderately well versed in Linux talk and I DO use VI.

The CTO is not a fan of Windows and would like to start replacing their Windows 2003 server infrastructure with a linux based one. As usual, cost is an issue, although not the overriding factor for decision making.

There are several Win2003 servers (that will have to stay Windows servers) that I would like to roll into an NT4 or AD domain. The current servers are all stand alone. The first server to be migrated is the server that will be the PDC. The plan is to then have a second server act as the BDC. Does Samba still have a problem with acting as a BDC? In a perfect world, I'd love to have a fully replicated server so that all we would have to do in an emergency is pull the plug on the first server and have the backup/replication server take over.

CLearOS seems like a decent bundled solution, but I have never tried it. Does any one here have any experience with it?

So my question: knowing what we are looking at, what would be the best solution? Utilizing ClearOS, or rolling my own using Debian/Samba?

Any and all thoughts would be appreciated.

I have evolved into doing things a certain way and it works but I should get smarter and deeper about this...

In my company we typically get hp proliant dl 1xx and 3xx servers in the current generation (now g6 to g7). But I notice in my company things done in completely different ways (monolithic / dirs, tiny /tmp dirs, etc). In my company culture the regions are somewhat antonymous and we do not have established standards for many processes. I want to develop an SOP so I need to take the things I have developed over time and critique them 

So starting with a midlevel proliant box and depending upon its purpose the partitioning changes a bit but typically when I partition Debian or CentOS servers it looks like this:

Often RAID 10 array of drives - sometimes RAID 5...

/boot ext2 256M (force primary)

/ ext3 5G (force primary)

swap at least 2G but try to mirror RAM amount

/tmp ext3 .5G to 1G

/usr ext3 (varies from 8-12 G typically, more in certain cases db servers, ldap...)

/var ext3 10-12G

/home ext3 depends...

If I can I leave a nice chunk of unused space at the end of the drive so I can go back and make new partitions (/var/cache /usr/local, etc)



My boot is ext2 because I see no need for journaling - is that size OK?

swap - do people generally try to match RAM?

generally it is good practice to separate /tmp, /usr, /var in my opinion  - are there compelling arguments against?

recommendations for web and/or paper reads on the subject?

Linux, as a router platform, is severely deficient at best.  Okay, fine, it sucks.

In any network design I've been involved in, OpenBSD is the OS of choice.  Sometimes I yield to complaints and allow FreeBSD which is easier to manage but not as flexible.  *(As a side note: FreeBSD has its own caveats.  It takes most of what makes it suitable as a router from OpenBSD and ports it.  However, these ports generally lag behind the upstream in significant ways.)*  The reasons are seemingly limitless: pf (the packet filtering system), pfsync, CARP, relayd, better out-of-the-box security, lower overhead, less average maintenance hours after production deployment - and the list goes on.

There are two processes that I've entered into the conf file. Using our Net Monitor, I see the process running for my first entry, but the second entry reports that that service is not running.

    ps -ef | grep watch.py

It returns */usr/bin/python /db1/name/watch.py boot* so that's what I've put into my conf file

I've tried using an escape to reflect the space between the two paths and before the 'boot' but that hasn't work either. 

I've gone back through the snmpd.conf man page and it's just not sinking in for me. I've tried searching for snmpd.conf examples where a process being monitored actually involves two processes.. and since I've been unsuccessful, I'm wondering if this just isn't feasible. 

So I suppose my question is, can I even monitor the 'watch.py' process? Is there an issue because it's invoked via python? Or is my syntax totally wrong?

Task: Share Internet Connection (usb0) via wlan0 AND eth0 **[SOLVED]**

Reason: To connect printer via Ethernet cable while still connecting wifi devices

Environment: CentOS

History: Internet (usb0) has been successfully shared via wlan0 for several months

Issues: eth0 device cannot talk to anybody - pings result in ""Destination Host Unreachable""

Evidence: 

-all three devices have static IPs and dhcpd is running without apparant errors on eth0 and wlan0 (connected devices receive dhcp addresses)

-eth0 and wlan0 have usb0 as their default gateway

-IPTables are as follows


    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    iptables -F
    iptables -t nat -F
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o usb0 -j MASQUERADE

**EDIT**

The issue, as pointed out by /u/lunaticfringe80 was that the two interfaces needed to be on different subnets. This was accomplished simply by adding another subnet declaration in dhcpd.conf and then assigning a different static ip address to one of the interfaces (I chose eth0, not that that matters much)

Also, I am not completely ignorant, but still very much new to this level of interaction with Linux.

Local:

* HP Proliant DL380
* Ubuntu 10.04
* six (6) 72.8Gb SCSI drives
* desktop GUI (sorry)
* remote desktop
* SSH

Local storage configuration:

* two (2) drives at RAID 0
* two (2) drives at RAID 0
* one (1) drive for boot
* one not used/empty

Remote:

* two (2) [InMotion Hosting](http://thehackernews.com/2011/09/inmotion-hosting-server-and-trinity-fm.html) VPSs
* CentOS
* LAMP
* root access
* SSH

Trigger:

If you follow that InMotion link you see that they were - and by proxy my company - the victim of an attack. All our sites were compromised. We had no backups other than what InMotion provides. Yes, I know how dumb that is. Not an excuse, but we are a small company and sometimes it's work on something that will make you money or work on something that benefits the company. Sunday and Monday was spent fixing everything and realize it could have been much worse.

Goal:

I would like to use rsync to back up the /home directory of each VPS to one of the RAID 0 drives so when needed I could send our local files back to the VPS from whence it came.

Problem:

I've already done some ground work. I can reach the VPS from the local machine and perform an rsync, understand how to create and add a bash file as a cron job, and set up SSH keys to eliminate the need for a login.

* **Would it be better to initiate the rsync from the local machine (pull) or from the remote VPS (push)?**
* **If pull, do I need to set up two bash/crons or can I run two rsyncs (one for each VPS/drive) at the same time (two rsync commands)?**

Final thoughts:

I know this is long and probably full of information you don't need. This sub helped me out before and was really welcoming and helpful so I'm back. Please know I have done my fair share of googling and trial and error. Being that I'm dealing with a production VPS I can't afford a mistake. Especially after our clients are already a little annoyed about yesterdays downtime.

Thank you.

As I see it, the hosts file would be a slightly quicker lookup than DNS, and doesn't depend on a service running that could fail and bring aspects of our app down that depend on name resolution, (someone screws up the zone file, DNS server outage, etc), and though marginal, increased network traffic and opening inter-VLAN security for access to the dns server.

I couldn't get my hosting provider to give me an official OS upgrade on my VPS so I have dragged my Dapper server kicking and screaming into Hardy by changing the repos and doing dist-upgrade (after standard methods failed).  I am also not a sysadmin, just a simple web developer and I know as much sysadmin stuff as day to day web dev requires, nothing more.

Software versions
OS: Ubuntu Hardy Heron (previously Dapper Drake)
Apache: 2.2.8
SVN Server: 1.5.1
SVN Client: Tortoise SVN 1.6.15

Since this 'upgrade' everything is working fine except for a few quirks which I am just unable to resolve after 2 days and I've pretty much exhausted Google and I am here in desperation.  Before the upgrade I had no issues at all except with an ancient OS I couldn't install any decent software.

As best as I can diagnose it, there are two problems.  Firstly (but not a show stopper) is that Apache refuses to honor basic auth over SSL and just serves up the content anyway.  If I remove the SSL requirement from the conf then the auth works as expected.

The second problem, which is killing me, is that SVN is really flaky over DAV.  Internally via file:// I don't have any issues, but via DAV it is doing some random things.  I get the same error in the apache error log for all these flaky actions but I will list the symptoms individually in case they offer an insight:

1. The 'create folder' command in Toirtoise repo-browser fails.  However I can checkout and add folders (not files) through normal SVN commands fine.

2. I cannot add any files at all (directories are fine).

EDIT:  This behaviour is the same for repos created before and after the upgrade.

This is the error message:

    (20014)Internal error: Can't open file '/var/www/svn/error/format': No such file or directory

Now, my repos are all stored under /vaw/ww/svn and always have been with no issues before the upgrade.  What I would expect the path to be is '/var/www/svn/repo_name/format' so it seems to me that the path is being mangled some how (but how can it checkout and add folders fine?!).

The only information I have found which seems to make sense but doesn't actually provide any traction towards a solution is that apache is throwing some kind of error (whatever it is it doesn't show in logs as a 500 or 403 or whatever) and that Plesk is trying to render a custom errror document (hence the path mangling as it uses Aliases for this).  I have checked and double checked through Plesk that the option to use custom error documents is disabled for the domain and also grepped all conf files for '/error' (it would have to exist as an alias I guess) but that turns up nada.

Thanks for reading.  I hope somebody can shed some light on this.

Update deleted because it seems the Plesk restart reverted my sources.list back to dapper and I ended up installing the dapper version of libapache-svn.

First, should I create a separate server with another linuxOS to run as a CA/OCSP service, and if so, is there a server.conf example that states how to get openVPN to check an OCSP service for certificate status? I'm not running into a lot of stuff on google how to setup

Secondly, is it advisable to have the certificate manager installed on the same server as the openvpn service (security-wise), maybe as an intermediate certificate authority while having another main CA off the network? 

Also, if there's a completely different direction I can take this, that would be helpful too. I feel like I'm grasping at straws trying to implement a tech I've not much experience with.

I am learning and attempting to set up a home environment for my RHCSA/RHCE studies. 

I have a server that I bought as a refurb from a fairly credible company. I am using this server through it's eth0 port. Server's IP is 172.20.20.2/24. I have KVM installed on the server so on the commands I include in my text dump, you will see some 192.168.1xx.xxx/24 virtual ports, etc.

Now, from my test machine (workstation 172.20.20.5) I am able to SSH and VNC to the machine when it wants to play nicely. I have a gig port from the .5 workstation, to a gig switch directly plugged into eth0 on the server. It may be wise to note this server is running CentOS 6.4. I also have an ESX host on this switch that runs completely fine.

Basically the issue is that randomly, the server starts refusing connection through SSH and VNC. It could be immediately after power on, intermittently fading in and out, etc. I can be on VNC one moment, ""connection"" refused the next, and then 5 minutes later back connected.

A ping from 172.20.20.5 workstation shows spotty latency during the times where connections are failing. However it will randomly begin to function and have a perfect LAN latency &gt;1ms. During the perfect latency, things will connect. Then when it decides to derp, things stop connecting. I sniffed the packets before and during the issue and didn't see anything particularly of note. I also ran a tcpdump on the server, which I can host somewhere if need be.

I have made a text file dump of various commands showing the device, driver, configurations, etc.

http://textuploader.com/?p=6&amp;id=lEFWW

Please let me know what else could be needed to help troubleshoot. This is driving me up the wall. I have updated the NIC driver bnx2 to the most recent update from the Broadcom site. I have disabled iptables and selinux completely. I have allowed the eth ports as trusted. I have turned off Network Manager. I messed with IP forwarding so that my KVM machines could connect but it had no part in whether or not the spikes would happen.

My last thoughts are that it may be a hardware issue. There is another onboard NIC i could attempt to test with and will likely do that when I am off of work...Until then can anyone offer any advise or point me in the right direction?

ANY help is greatly appreciated. I've been bashing my head at this for a while now and just want to be able to roll out my RHCSA labs!

Thank you!

There is also a cron job I show that I set up hoping a ping from inside could keep things alive, but it also did not help.

@ ALL

OH MY GOD I MIGHT BE RETARDED. Stand by.

EDIT2: 

YUP! Think I found the issue and I am -in fact- retarded.

Looks like when I set the 172.20.20.2 address on the server, I wasn't expecting my DHCP pool on my DHCP server to be using that address space (for some reason was thinking 100-150 was what I had given it to use). Turns out .2 was being taken by one of the damn cell phones in the house, hence google talk entires. When the server lost connection it was going apeshit with ARPs because of the IP address issue, and was ARPing itself to that IP when it was being used by the phone. I noted that when I rebooted the server, I lost connection to the IP for a brief second, then it started going apeshit (wireless phone 2 floors up somewhere) and then after the server came fully online, it would be clean for a while -- presumably once it had kicked off the phone.

**TLDR:** Duplicate IP address &gt; me. I can't believe I completely overlooked that shit. I am ashamed to call myself a CCNP.

so, what can i do ?

option 1: create a /dev/md2 and concatenate a 2 TB drive at the end of md1. the new disk wouldn't be mirrored (the server accepts a maximum of 4 HDs).
option 2: split /dev/md1, convert it from RAID1 to RAID0 and concatenate one of the disks at the end.

So, setting out I am running into 2 distinct problems.  First, I can get SLES installed with no problems, but the OES install (which I am trying to install as add on software during the SLES install) seems to fail.  I can get the OES media to register as a source for add on's, and there are no explicit errors about the OES failures, just repeated messages that say something to the effect of 'The module 'something_oes_somethingelse is not working.'  The module name changes, and these problems only come up during the 'OES Install' portion of the server setup.

So, OES doesn't seem to want to install.  I am kind of OK with that in an academic sense, but my next problem has really stumped me.

SLES wants to apply patches right after registration, which seems reasonable to me.  When I download and apply the recommended packages a new kernel install recommends a reboot.  After reboot, my ethernet interfaces are non-functioning.  They seem to work physically - indicator lights.  They do work before updates.  But once updates are applied, both nics in the machine are registered as hardware in YAST, but will not activate.  They just appear disconnected.  I have had this happen twice, once when I applied patches during the install routine, and once after running through the install routine and updating using Yast on a seemingly stable system.

Novell's documentation has been less than helpful, and I cannot get any meaningful hits from google on the borked module errors, or anything definitive about the network breakage.

Anyone have any experience with SLES, and if so, can you point me in a reasonable direction for a networking fix?  If you have experience with OES, can I install it from YAST once I have a stable server running, or do I have to install it during server install?

Linode has a good [library](http://library.linode.com/) and even provides scripts they call [StackScripts](http://www.linode.com/stackscripts/) (a proprietary thing?) to set up e.g. a LAMP stack.

I'm not a snowflake, but I do have some requirements that aren't met by the pre-built StackScripts.  Plus, I don't want to tie myself to Linode.

I have an iSCSI target set up, exporting the LUN to my initiator, which registers it as /dev/sdb. This works perfectly.

I then set up an lvm, /dev/vgx, on top of that physical device. Again, this works fine. EXCEPT when I reboot. The VG is detected, but the LVs in it are inactive.

I've tried putting ""vgchange -ay /dev/vgx"" into my rc.local, but the LVs are still inactive every time I boot. However, as soon as I run that command manually, they come up!

(1) The LVs are not being used for boot disks on the host itself, so I'm not worried about them starting late in the boot process.
(2) This LUN is being exported to two different hosts, who will use different LVs within it (Xen shared storage for live migration for the curious); ideally my rc.local will activate specific LVs on each host and leave the rest inactive.
(3) I've tried changing the order of my daemons in /etc/rc5.d, but this doesn't affect it at all.
(4) I've tested various underlying block devices on the target (raw disk, LVM partition, and ZFS Zvol, which is my solution of choice) and this has no effect.

Has anyone seen this before? I'm probably missing something, but I've followed three different guides on setting up Xen live migration and they all agree on the steps, which I followed to the letter. None of them mention issues with the LVs being detected on boot.

EDIT: I may have jumped the gun a bit in declaring it fixed. More results coming.

EDIT2: I believe I got it working.

But once I disabled the VMs it was working great. (2) I was using /bin/bash in my ""initscript"", when I should have been using /bin/sh, but I have no clue if that matters. (3) I had manually added a symlink into /etc/rc5.d and given it a number between other services, when I should have run update-rc.d to add it automatically.

For the last two years I've been running debian squeeze as my home file server. This has worked well, being stable and allowing Windows integration. Thinking ahead to the next release and to minimise the amount of work beyond this I've been wondering about the value of running my file server in a virtual machine.

I'd like to reduce the amount of time setting up the fileserver again in the case of a hardware/software fault. My existing setup is to create half-yearly images of the harddrive, but this relies on deploying the clone onto the very same hardware configuration.

_benefits_
1.  Can automate weeky backups/snapshots of the VM (more regular than the current half-yearly that I do)
2.  Can deploy to a different computer if something happens to the host PC.
3.  Learn about running virtual machines.
4.  Greater flexibility when making changes and rolling back (rare)
5.  Can run several OSes on the same host machine.
6.  Will run on my HP Proliant microserver so will use less power than the tower currently in use.

_cons_
1.  USB support possible?
2.  Overkill?
3.  How to network to this VM from the local network. The local network IP range is 192.168.0.1 whereas VirtualBox gives a different IP range.
4.  Will still need to upgrade the host OS when the the next release is made.

I've inherited the job of backing up data from our archive server to tape. This is kind of and advanced Linux4noobs question (I've cross posted on /Linux4noobs and /sysadmin too). I am a Windows sysadmin by day but Linux is a dark art to me.

We have CentOS 6.2 installed onto a Dell PC with a HP LTO4 tape drive connected via SCSI. I can successfully get large quantities of data to the tape drive by using the following command:

tar --one-file-system --tape-length=795G -cMvf /dev/st0 /mnt/files |tee /var/tmp/file_list.txt

This takes the files located at the /mnt directory and pushes them out to /dev/st0 which is our tape device, once it has written 795Gb, it requests another tape till it has taken all the data from that directory and the ones below it. The tee command is there to create a file log of what is on the tape.

Where I am struggling is being able to pull a single file back from the set of tapes. I have used the following command, resulting in no restored files but a message saying ""You have new mail in /var/spool/mail/root"" which I am not sure how to read.

The commands I have tried are:
tar --multi-volume -xvf /dev/st0 ""%full name of file as shown in file_list.txt%"" -C  %location to recover to%

and variations of this, such as putting in the exact path the file was backed up from, a /tmp and /home area to recover to. All this is being run as root so there shouldn't be any problems writing to an area.

Am I missing something obvious or going about this completely the wrong way? Can a single file even be extracted from a tar file on a tape?

First of all this problem is on a FreeNAS server, not a linux one. I hope it's okay, I did not find an active subreddit for FreeBSD systems, since it's fairly similar I assumed I could ask for help here.

So I have a FreeNAS server with theses technologies used :

CIFS
ZFS
FTP

We have one client using FTP on it through the WAN and 64 clients connectings through CIFS.
Both FTP and CIFS share are on the ZFS pool (wich is on a hardware RAID 10).

Our problem is that our clients are randomly disconnected from the FreeNAS for random amounts of time. During the disconnection the client and the server cannot even ping each other.
The 64 internal clients are on one cisco switch connected directly to the FreeNAS. Same network, same subnet.

We tried doing a failover lagg between 2 Ethernet interfaces on 2 different network cards. Same Problem
We tried doing a load balancing lagg. Same Problem.

When I see they are randomly connected I mean that the clients disconnected are random, but they are always clients that cannot access the server at any given time. Some times it's number 3, 15, 45, 50, 60 and sometimes it's another random group of clients.

That's it. We are trying to figure it out but so far we are going through logs and specialized forums.

I'm studying for RHCSA and I'm learning my LVM, but this question applies to ext3/4 etc as well. When I add a 17GB hard disk to my VM for instance, I can use fdisk to create a new partition and when it asks for the start and end values it will, if you push enter, automatically take the first available sector and the last available sector, essentially taking the whole disk. 

Parted, however does not do this. It provides empty prompts and so far the only way I've been able to make a partition take the whole HD is by guessing, trial and error as it were.

I am sure there is a better way of doing this, but every example I come across just provides a command like 'mkpart primary 106 16179' e.g. http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/09/parted-command-examples/

Where do they get these numbers from? If you wanted to use the whole of a disk that is reported in Parted as 17.2GB, how would you know what values to enter? If I enter 0M and 17.6G as my values it works, albeit with the *Warning: The resulting partition is not properly aligned for best performance*.

Is anybody able to explain what is going on, and what the best way to go about this is?

Thanks!

So I'm trying to configure Squid as a reverse proxy, listening on port 80, in front of two web servers.  One web server runs on the localhost and listens on port 81 and contains a subset of all website content.  Then the second web server is a remote box, listening on port 80, with a full set of all content.

What I'd like Squid to do is act as a single front-end for these servers.  A request comes in, and if it's a cache miss, it should first ask the localhost web server if it can satisfy the request.  If so, it serves it up.  If not, it should forward it on to the second web server.

Following the guide here: http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Reverse/MultipleWebservers, I've come up with the following config:

    http_port 80 accel defaultsite=localhost
    cache_peer localhost parent 81 0 originserver name=local
    cache_peer example.com parent 80 0 originserver name=remote
    acl request dstdomain localhost
    cache_peer_access local allow request
    cache_peer_access remote allow request

(I have other ACLs unrelated to this config, such as allowing http requests on port 80).

The problem I run into is that a miss on the localhost web server (an HTTP 404) isn't properly forwarded on to the remote server - squid only ever tries a single parent.  If I remove the localhost peer, the request is properly forwarded, and I get back the expected HTTP 200.

What am I missing in my config to make it do that?

(And please, no posts saying ""you should just use this other thing..."", as I am not in a position to make infra/arch decisions, and am pretty much stuck with the design I was given).

I have used them in the past, I currently manage a mail server, but we just purchased a new server a month ago and I'm configuring and working on testing it before moving it into our environment. About 2 months ago I asked for suggestions on the Mail server and was met with a number of options. I took all the suggestions and did my research and decided on using iRedmail since it seemed to be well documented, easy to setup and run, and was compatible with my choosen OS. However i have found that while being well documented on the install, the after install/management of the program is lacking. The only real suggestion they seem to have is to purchase their iredadmin software to make configuration easy. However I don't see the need to do this as I can manage it fairly easy, once I understand the basics. Now just to find those basics...

A quick over view of the program is that it uses common packages for the base, Postfix, dovecot, postgressql and ties it in with Amivisd and clamav nicely.

The simplest way to go about this seems to be to use an AD dc since Samba doesn't seem to interate with LDAP well at all. I've tried CentOS 389 as the dc and FreeNAS as well as Nas4Free for the actual share. But the overhead with maintaining Samba users is excessive. At least I can't find a way to get it functional without needing to add a bunch of the Samba attributes to each user individually.

The goal is to get the People/Users object to simply have auth rights to the NAS in general with all users getting a generated 'home' share as well as having LDAP groups be used as permissions for group shares. The shares themselves would simply be exposed as 2 directories, server\groups and server\users with groups/user directories beneath with correct permissions.

Is there something I'm missing that should be done in LDAP to play nicer with Samba or possibly another solution entirely?

The trouble seems to be that I need to support both AFP and CIFS which means I can't use Windows to serve up the shares. The current live implementation is Windows serving iSCSI to some Apple boxes which are handling permissions via an Apple dc. It's very inefficient.

Using AD is not preferred since I have no experience with it and it's a huge hassle with the current infrastructure.

As the title says, I run an unRAID server which I need access from outside.

Currently I have 2 options for this, option 1 is preferable to me.

1: Open up a random port on my router and route to unRAID running openssh

2: Enable the VPN on dd-wrt


Now, the reason I prefer SSH should be clear, but if it isn't, it is much easier for me plus it'll allow me to EASILY and automatically allow my company server (small business) to send weekly backups of our company file to my home server, just so we have something offsite.


Now, I've disabled root and no passwords for my SSH, but what else can I do to make it more secure on the server side? public keys, no passwords, sshv2, so on and so forth. Hit me with all you've got, I have to make sure this thing is as secure as possible to leave ssh open 24/7

All of the other boxes can ping each other fine, it's just this new one that can't ping some of the boxes. It can ping some fine with 0% packet loss, others with 50 to 90% packet loss and some with total packet loss. Interestingly, the other hosts seem to be able to ping the new box and get an echo back even when it can ping them (can't ping from all of the hosts because some of them are network devices like printers). One of the hosts that it struggles to ping is the router/gateway. It can ping our main server (also does DHCP and DNS) with no problems.

I doubt it's a problem with the volume of data because I'm able to get NFS working on there and push a lot of traffic without issue.

The first thing we do when installing a new desktop is applying our standard puppet manifest to it, so we can be sure that they all have a near identical configuration.

We only have one switch, and that's connected to only one router and everything is connected to that switch. I'm pretty satisfied that it's not a physical problem because the new box can ping some hosts find and the switch is in between the box and all of the other hosts. All wiring is copper Cat5e cable and I have tested the connection with another box to make sure it's not the connection.

I did a cursory search of different subreddits - started with sysadmin - and it seems like there are at least some tech-support-related-specifically-to-linux-network-management questions in this subreddit. If I'm in the wrong place, please let me know. 

Here's what I'm trying to do:

I've got a jump point box. It's got 3 physical network interfaces. One NI hits a wider eng. LAN, the other two NIs hit small LANs that need to stay isolated (unit testers for packet traffic.) 

What I desire is the ability to ssh/telnet into a particular port on the jump point box and have that port route me to the IP address of one of the cards on the smaller LANs; i.e.,

telnet &lt;jump_point_box_IP&gt; &lt;unique_port&gt; --&gt; lowest-level interface on the card on the smaller LAN

Essentially, I'd like to treat the ports on the jump point box the same way a console server treats its ports, just with TCP connections.

I've tried this with the iptables command. This is what I put together, cribbing from a borrowed book and online:

Entered from ssh command line on jump point box:

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp –i eth0 \--destination-port 8001 -j DNAT --to-destination &lt;small_LAN_card&gt;

    iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d &lt;small_LAN_card&gt; -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

These were accepted, but then when I exit out from the jump point box to my PC and try to telnet to port 8001, I get the usual ""could not find host"" error message. 

**tl;dr - new to iptables, trying to figure out how to set it up to route a port on one box to the ip address of another box***

Thoughts? Opinions? Fish?

As an aside, if anyone has any suggestions for a better/more refined tool to use aside that builds on or is higher-level than iptables, please let me know.

The server is Ubuntu Server 10.04 and my local machine is openSUSE 12.1

After this going on for a while, I replaced the domain name from no-ip.com with the local IP address (fortunately I was working from home today) and now it is as solid as a rock.

During the install, I notice the following errors/warnings:

    2) I installed ThinVNC Access Point in my Ubuntu distribution (using wine). It's a Windows program that you could install in any Windows computer. But I preferred to test it in my Linux environment.
    
    3) I opened the browser in the Ubuntu computer to https://127.0.0.1/ and I changed the default admin password (user admin, password admin).
    
    4) I added three users: hugo, john, steven.
    
    5) I added four computers: Galaxian (the same running Ubuntu which already has installed XRDP), NewYork (running Windows 7), Memphis (running XP), California (running Ubuntu 11.04. I installed XRDP here)

    7) I am using my notebook to access to these computers. I'm out of my LAN now and this application is working perfectly. I'm using Chrome now, but I tested with Firefox and Safari too.

This has all run fine until the last few weeks. Increasingly more frequently (once a day or so), Apache stops responding, accepting connections on port 80 but seemingly sitting there, unresponsive.

In the error log, I see ""Server reached MaxClients setting, consider raising the MaxClients setting"". A netstat shows there are indeed a lot of clients connected, but I feel this is more a symptom rather than a cause - this is not a particularly busy server - I suspect when the problem hits, Apache continues accepting connections but fails to complete serving them correctly.

If I try a ""service httpd stop"", one or two httpd processes refuse to die until I perform a brutal ""kill -9"" on them. Apache will then start correctly - but the problem repeats, sometimes after a few hours, sometimes the next day.

How can I go about debugging/resolving this issue? With the Apache processes which refuse to die correctly, can I find out which VirtualHost it was serving, in case it's specific to a VHost - perhaps an out of control PHP process or similar?",,False,,t5_2r9lc,1354751220.0,,,True,t3_14cocl,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/14cocl/apache_server_socket_timeouts/,

I've somehow inherited the sysadmin role for my new company, and now I need help figuring out how to manage a bunch of Ubuntu 12.04 servers on EC2.  Here's the scenario:

- I have a custom AMI that I've created for a ""stock"" image of our servers.
- I need to regularly drop new files (static HTML content as well as a custom web application contained in a .war file) across multiple instances.
- I need to be able to perform some configuration (mostly modifying a single config file, push it to each server and then run a CLI command to reload the config and restart the server)
- I need to be able to automatically create a new user with a specific group but no home directory.

Sadly I can go about doing this all by hand since we currently only have a handful of servers, but that is destined to change.  I've stumbled across Chef and Ubuntu's Juju, but I'm wondering if I'm on the right track or should I be looking elsewhere.  My Linux skills are not great, but I'm not completely helpless either.  However for this scope I'm just looking for a guide to at least point me in the right direction.

I will start by replacing rsync for you.,12,14,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/uedbc/does_anyone_have_any_protips_that_will_help_newer/,"I sometimes have to backup a lot of data from users that move out of the university that I work at. Rsync tends to be very slow and serial at transferring data. I user [globus-url-copy] (http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/data/gridftp/rn01re01.html) from the [Globus Toolkit] to transfer data. I do work on High Performance Linux clusters with high speed networking with decently fast storage, but nevertheless I use Globus-FTP at home to backup my backups on my Macs and Windows boxes.

The Globus Toolkit is meant for research grids, but works wonders for local transfers. It basically allows you to transfer data by breaking up the data into smaller chunks just like Torrents except it is file by file. Even lots of small files tend to be fast. You can pick your block size and sync directories with various levels of checksums. There is so much to play around with it, but the guide in the link above provides some really good values to try. You can even use multiple interfaces to copy the same files. For remote copies there is a server to set up but you can just use ftp or local files. 

Anybody else have any tips?",,False,,t5_2r9lc,False,,,True,t3_uedbc,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/uedbc/does_anyone_have_any_protips_that_will_help_newer/,

some ideas i've had for the education budget are:

* classes like www.oreillyschool.com
* admin/linux/networking/programming books
* conferences

then i'd just the tuition assistance to get a MBA or a comp-sci masters.  any suggestions on good online MBA/Masters programs?",,False,,t5_2r9lc,False,,,True,t3_r2dkv,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/r2dkv/new_junior_admin_how_should_i_put_my_companies/,
