I've had a few people tell me reddit would be a great place to have a discussion with fans.  And what does a man do?  A man provides.

I've played many roles over the years. You might know me from Breaking Bad, where I play Gus Fring. 

I'll begin answering questions here at 2:30pm EST.  I'll answer as many questions as I can get to in the discussion.  (no spoilers in the questions please!)  Also, for a few of your questions where I have longer / interesting stories, I'll also be posting videos with my answer to my YouTube channel http://www.youtube.com/digitalforhumans with a video response.

Just as his character on the show, Walter White Jr,, has cerebral palsy so does Mitte, although Mitte’s is a milder form of the disability.  RJ will next be seen starring as Tim in the upcoming fantasy thriller feature film House of Last Things which screened at the first ever Paris Film Festival. RJ appears in the new documentary film “CinemAbility”.  It is a detailed look at the evolution of disability in entertainment and features a who’s who of Hollywood:  RJ, Ben Affleck, Jamie Foxx, Gary Sinise, and David Milch, among others. He recently had a guest-starring role on the CBS hit Vegas.

A new teaser clip contains a scene he described. Which means everything he posted is likely true. Be on the lookout for spoilers.

--------------

There is a new TV promo for the final episodes, only a few seconds long, featuring Walt. If you are sharp, you will find a spoiler. It's not a big deal but I wish I hadn't watched it to remain spoiler-free. You may want to skip it. Anyway, the big deal is that this scene was described by someone back in February. This person listed many other details about the first of the final episodes, and because he was right about this, he's probably right about everything. That means we may come across S05E09 spoilers if we aren't careful.


Here is a post for the new TV promo clip. In the comments you will find a link to all the spoilers. Enter at your own risk. http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/1ib8w7/new_10_sec_walter_white_teaser_that_just_aired/

If you wish to be spoiled, please do the rest of us a favor. Do not post ""theories"" about what might happen for karma. And if you see any ""theories"" that are too accurate, please Report them.

Tuesday's AMA rocked and as a thank you, I filmed a little video to commemorate my favorite moments in a new type of award show called ""The Bitchies."" 

Here's the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEK5_S740E4&amp;feature=youtu.be

I haven't figured out what the actual award should like yet but if you guys have any ideas, I'd love to see them. I'll print out my favorite one, sign it, and send it to you. Yeah, reddit bitch!

Also you bitches are crushing it with Kind Campaign. We've raised over $50k, which blows my mind.  I promise whoever wins will have the most insane weekend of their life (I'm thinking the night before the finale we even TP Heisenberg's house)

Here's the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGHsa72lz9I
 
I also want to thank you for your incredible support of NCMEC. We’ve already raised more than $40K, which is truly incredible. So as a token of my appreciation, I’m going to make the experience even better and invite my castmates to join us in the RV: http://omaze.com/breakingbad

Watch out for cranes.

Update: Shitty_Watercolour inspired me even further... I also want your help decorating the RV. So submit your best photo, painting, or whatever you come up with in the comments below and I'll look through them, choose my favorite, hang it up in the RV for the night of the premiere, and post a video shout out after. And if you submit the best art and also win the contest, then I'll just let you put it up yourself.

NO.

There are a few reasons for this. The main reason is that Vince has a story to tell and that story should be completely told within this show. No loose ends, no important questions left unanswered. We should all be satisfied by the end of this amazing series. (most of us atleast.)

Another reason that I'm surprised some of you haven't realized, is that a Breaking Bad movie just would not be successful. Believe it or not, not many people watch this show. What..between 2-3 million? That isn't that much for a tv show. With that, you would have had to watch the show to have any idea what was going on in the movie. Either that, or they dumb down a 5 season story into a 2 hour story. I can't see Breaking Bad being a profitable investment for a movie company.

There are many other reasons but come on guys. There was talks of a Lost movie, a Sopranos movie and so on. They never come to fruition and i know that this won't either so I wish we could just stop talking about it. 

Yes, we all want more Breaking Bad, but a movie is just not a good idea. Breaking Bad should be an epic, 5 season story that is completely self-contained.

My grandmother said its the only show he can watch without falling asleep.

This week, he had to take my mother to an eye doctor, and when he rolled up to drop her off in his Mercedes convertible, his sunglasses on and what's left of his hair tied back in his signature ponytail, he looks me up and down and says:

Edit: Whoa. I'm always considering the quality of life of the children I know and anytime I give to fundraisers or do fundraisers it's always about children. That ending was hard for me... :( I cried :(

He and actor [Luis Moncada](/u/LuisMoncada) (one of the twin assassin on Breaking Bad) wanted to do some sort of fundraiser on r/breakingbad, and asked for our advice.

Today starting at 1 PM Pacific time, /r/breakingbad will host multiple actors from the show. They will be here not only to answer your questions, but also to help raise money for A Place Called Home, a charity selected by [Luis Moncada](/u/LuisMoncada). Timing and logistics are always tricky, but scheduled to join us are /u/LuisMoncada, /u/Cbakeractor, and /u/RodneyRush.

Luis used to have a pretty rough life in the gang world before he became an actor and motivational speaker. The charity that he selected is [A Place Called Home](http://www.apch.org/) which focuses on educating children in Los Angeles about gang violence and drug abuse. Check out their informative video that explains everything they do for the community [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLyRe0575jc).

To donate, follow [this](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/breaking-good) link and click “Contribute.” Your credit card will not be charged unless the campaign reaches its goal of $1,000. Once the campaign reaches its goal, we will be randomly selecting users who donated and distributing prizes to them (Breaking Bad Season 4 DVDs and misc reddit swag).


**UPDATE**: At 4 PM CST we reached our $1,000 goal! Please keep donating, because anything donated above our goal will also be donated to A Place Called Home. ",,False,,t5_2rlw4,1341523050.0,,,True,t3_w3aou,http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/w3aou/the_event_breaking_good/,admin

I'm just a guy trying to make a living the only way I know how, so, please, be gentle with me! 
Aside from Breaking Bad, I have also had a few guest star roles on other tv shows as well as a couple of supporting roles in a few features, including a pretty nice role in an  [Untitled film] (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1889973/) directed by Terrence Malick 
I'm also in a couple of short films that are making the festival circuit right now, KNIFE, Directed by [James Johnston](http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/55209/exclusive-interview-indie-filmmaker-james-m-johnston-discusses-his-latest-short-film-knif), and [ODDS OR EVENS](http://deadcenter.festivalgenius.com/2012/films/oddsorevens_jaygormley_deadcenter2012) which is premiering at Dead Center Film Festival in Ok City, Ok.   And, for the STEAMPUNK fans out there, I will be playing the demon Neshrew in a new series called [THE MECHANICAL GRAVE](http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47124/check-out-robotic-trailer-mechanical-grave), IF we can keep getting more support from incredibly awesome fans, like you...(pander, pander)

9.5 hours later...I do believe I've answered what I can! What a bad ass group of very inquisitive people you are!!!I loved the questions, loved the cool nature of the whole thing, and I really had fun!

But it was in the garage, Hank shrank. He started strong, punching Walt in the face. Saying he didn't care about family and such. But then, he starts talking and that's what lowers him. 

""You killed all those people in prison."" ""You blew up a nursing home."" ""I don't know who you are."" See, before he starts that train of thought, Hank still sees himself as the dominate and stronger male. But verbalizing those actions, he kind of convinces himself...""Oh shit, he's had people in prison killed. he blew up a nursing home. I really don't know him. He's so much more dangerous than I am.""

The ""tread lightly"" line is great. But it's just icing on the cake. We see Hank go from anger and confidence, to fear and weakness in about 5 seconds. He was there before ""tread lightly.""

They explain everything really well to Todd like the refilling of the water to the tank. But one thing they never explicitly explained was how they could make sure the train would stop before it reached the truck.

So I looked into it a bit. When finding the distance between the crossroad and the place they extract the methylamine, Jesse finds that it's 814 feet. The national speed limit for a freight train is 60 mph. Looking at the emergency breaking distance for the average freight train I found out that it was 820 feet when going 62 mph. So assuming they started breaking right at the extraction point and they were going about 60 mph it would be a perfect stop right at the crossroad.

Not a super important detail but another example of Vince and the writers covering all their bases that I thought was pretty cool.

The way that Vince and co. messed with our heads was amazing.

He knew that we knew something was going to happen, and had us freaking out over the most innocuous poolside conversation.  He drew it out, making it almost unbearable for us.

Little nuisances like Walt Jr. wheeling Hollie right next to the pool, Hank and Walt shooting the shit about chemistry and brewing (cooking) beer, etc. had us guessing as to what could possibly happen.  We were absolutely on edge about every tiny detail and tiny details were carefully placed to make the scene even more stressful.

It was almost too much to watch and absolutely nothing of note was happening.  

Genius.

Hank now knows that Walt is the Heisenberg he's been searching for since season 2. This leaves Hanks with two options; either turn Walt in or turn the other cheek. 

We know Hank's moral fiber won't let him simply roll over and allow Walt to get away with it. But there are a few conflicts of interest for Hank.

The DEA will have a very hard time believing that Hank was not working with Walt since Walt was able to get away with this for so long while Hank could have been a hired hand for Walt on the inside. With the destruction of the Laptop in the evidence room, a bug on Hanks computer that may have left a trace that it was on his system, the countless walls Hank has run into with his investigations. And most importantly, the fact that Hank has been so passionate about leading the investigatioin on the blue meth trail without being able to bring Walt in until all is said and done.

What makes Hank more explicitly linked to Walt is the money he has been accepting from Walt (via Marie) to pay for his physical therapy treatment. There is no way Hank can bring Walt down without an audit that could bring Hank down just as hard as Walt.

So at this point if Hank turns Walt in he's most likely going down with Walt for the same long prison sentence. 

Hank stands to lose more then Walt because if Walt is caught and incarcerated he's going down as the bad guy that he is at this point. If or when Hank is tied into a similar conviction. 

Hank might end up becoming the most tragic victim of Walt's transformation into the bad guy. I mean, he's already been paralyzed by Walt's actions, all while being the [""good guy""](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/13rj99/spoilers_hank_has_more_to_lose_than_walt/c76iss1) character on the show (sans Walt Jr.).",Spoiler,False,,t5_2rlw4,1353866835.0,spoiler,user-flair,True,t3_13rj99,http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/13rj99/spoilers_hank_has_more_to_lose_than_walt/,

1345434778.0,1278,self.breakingbad,yi8i2,"The Importance of Grey Matter: How ""Buyout"" Tied the Whole Series Together [Spoilers]",1643,365,492,http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi8i2/the_importance_of_grey_matter_how_buyout_tied_the/,"Walt's speech about Grey Matter tied the entire series together, and I think that it will be a vital talking point when Walter White the character is discussed years down the line. Here's why.

In the scene with Jesse in his house, Walt basically put the final piece in a puzzle that the viewers didn't even realize the construction of. Now, for the first time since the show began, we truly know why Walt does what he does. For years, he had been embarrassed by his failure at Grey Matter, and his idiotic mistake of taking the $5000. This is something that has haunted him for his entire life (he checks Grey Matter's value weekly, apparently). 

Now think back to the pilot. He and Hank watch the news report about Hank's bust. He sees piles upon piles of cash, more money than he could ever imagine making as a teacher. Now, we're made to believe that his first thought is of his family, but after tonight's episode, I think differently. I think his first thought is of his mistake at Grey Matter, and of the potential money that he could make cooking meth. 

At first, of course, providing for his family was a big part of the plan. But at the end of the day, it all came back to his self-centered nature. He doesn't *just* want to make the $737k for Skyler and Walt Jr. For him, making the money is a way to prove that he hasn't wasted his life. He is using his chemistry skills in an incredibly profitable way.

So he keeps going. And going. And going. For a while in Season 3, he splits with Jesse, and what is it that gets him back in the business? His arrogance over Jesse cooking with his formula. At this point, it's no longer about providing for his family. It's about making money, proving to himself that he can be better than Elliott. More importantly, he's now seen Gustavo Fring. He's seen how far someone can go in the meth business. He's seen his ultimate goal.

Walter is a man who is primarily driven by jealousy and a desire to be better than others. This is prevalent in everything from his meth business to his marriage. In ""Buyout"", he revealed what's been driving his choices, his emotions, this whole time. His mistake at Grey Matter, and his potential loss of billions (with a ""B"") of dollars. I don't think Walt will be truly satisfied until he leads a meth empire that rivals Grey Matter in terms of worth. I'm planning on rewatching the series from the beginning, and I guarantee that little hints of this character aspect have been present from the beginning. Here's one you might remember, just off the top of my head. 

&gt; ""Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? **A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ** goes belly up. Disappears! **It ceases to exist without me.**""

It is actually a long-argued and deeply philosophical question that has relations to philosophers like Derek Parfit and John Locke, and moreover, it's a conversation directly addressing the central point of Breaking Bad as a show:

How much can someone change before he is something else entirely?

I'm not a philosophy major so I apologize if I don't explain all this adequately. I studied and read about this theory back in college and was reminded when the show addressed it. Anyway, let's start with the theory itself.

The theory that Badger is discussing is Derek Parfit's teletransporter theory. It has to do with the following thought experiment:

""Suppose that you enter a cubicle in which, when you press a button, a scanner records the states of all the cells in your brain and body, destroying both while doing so.  This information is then transmitted at the speed of light to some other planet, where a replicator produces a perfect organic copy of you.  Since the brain of your Replica is exactly like yours, it will seem to remember living your life up to the moment when you pressed the button, its character will be just like yours, and it will be in every other way psychologically continuous with you. Are you sure the person on the other side is you?""

Essentially, the question poses the idea that ""you"" aren't being transported at all, and instead, you're just dying. A copy of you is made on the other side, but it's not you. 

Going back to the episode itself, we can now see that Badger's mindless babble actually holds deeply significant meaning to the show. As you are transported to your new destination, are you simply going there, or is something more morbid happening?

I think this is also a commentary on Walter White. So many people have said that this show is about his descent into becoming the truly vile Heisenberg, and how bit by bit, whoever Walter White was at the beginning of the show has ceased to exist. As Walter White has transported to his new destination as Heisenberg, has he simply gone there? Is he Walter White AS Heisenberg? Or has something more morbid happened? Is Walter White dead?

I really am not stupid enough to think I really unwrapped the whole significance of the scene and the allusion to philosophy to the show. Hopefully this was as thought-provoking to you guys as it was for me and someone will be able to shed more light on it all. Thanks for reading.

edify also told me to let you guys know that if the Breaking Good fundraiser reaches $3,000 (we are $157.57 short) he will let me film him doing some challenges. I want him to do the cinnamon challenge and the gallon of milk challenge, so go donate so I can film my friend being a dumb ass... LOL

So when we watched season 3 and season 4 of Breaking Bad, Mike wasn't really fleshed out much and I think that gave me this impression of who Mike was and after watching season 5 I think I was a bit mistaken.

When Mike gives Walt the No Half Measures speech, I always understood it as Mike had always been in control of the situation. Meaning, when he decided not to kill the guy out in the middle of no where, he had planned on not killing him the entire time and just wanted to scare him.

Well after watching the scene where Mike is about to kill Lydia and he tells her to shut up because he has to think about what he's going to do, it dawned on me. This is probably exactly what happened to Mike when he took the abusive boyfriend out in the middle of no where. He had planned on killing him but after the man pleaded for his life (like Lydia did) he had a change of heart that led to his ultimate demise (The first probably is what led to Mike losing his job in Philly and getting a reputation there, the second being shot down by Walt after not killing Lydia). If Mike did kill Lydia when he had the chance, he could have got out of dodge instead of prolonging the inevitable. 

Mike being the professional he is has one big weakness, he has a big heart. And when he let people in he ended up becoming vested in them. Even Walt to a certain extent. Even though Walt became a maniac he still didn't turn his back on him (until he finally did and ended up getting gunned down). 

I just find it interesting that Mike told the half measure story as if it was a learning experience for him but he was actually showing us his achilles heal.",,False,,t5_2rlw4,1351794618.0,,user-flair,True,t3_12gfz2,http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/12gfz2/i_took_a_half_measure_when_i_should_have_gone_all/,
