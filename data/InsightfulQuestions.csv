However, I was dissapointed about the lack of intellectual discussion going on in the comments section of these posts - mostly strawman arguements. 

Ofcourse, I completely understand why reddit should remove outright CP, as it's illegal. But how about a reddit promoting domestic violence? And if such a subreddit is removed, how should we justify the continued existance of [/r/trees](/r/trees)? One of the arguements against pictures used in [/r/jailbait](/r/jailbait) is that it is not consented, but neither are many of the meme pictures we use on reddit too. An arguement for the existence of such subreddits is that it's a slippery slope - does censoring one subreddit really mean that future content will be more likely to be censored as well?

I'd like to see an intellectual discussion about this stuff. Could we work out some guidelines on what is acceptable and what isn't, or is it simply too morally ambiguous or too personal to come to a consensus? 

**EDIT: I'd just like to make clear that I'm not defending any illegal content on reddit, and am neither too thrilled about such subreddits. I am interested in having a mature discussion on where we can draw the lines - what is acceptable and what isn't?**

Can someone explain to me why it is wrong to *ever* celebrate death? Some people's lives, surely, make the world a worse place. For some of those people, their death improves the world. If an event improves the world, why can't I celebrate it? I don't think that answers invoking ""respect"" or ""dignity"" can really be consistent, because if anyone is deserving of those surely it must be people who are still alive? They will surely benefit more than someone who is dead, yet paradoxically death seems to call for an *increasing* amount of respect. And if it is respect for their loved ones (a better answer I think), then why do we not show similar respect when people are put in prison, for example? Or when a despot is removed from power their family will suffer hugely, but we still rejoice? Many innocent white families suffered in the transition to a post-apartheid South Africa, but we can recognise that while still celebrating the change? More generally, we can recognise individual pain while still being pleased about the overall situation.

I think most of us would, at least inwardly, celebrate some people's death- Hitler, Stalin, Pinochet, Franco, your_fav_dictactor_here? Is there a point at which someone's evil outdoes the badness of celebrating their death? If this is the case, then why have so many critics started with ""Whatever you think of her politics...""? Surely if it is *ever* OK to celebrate death, then someone's politics and actions are the most important thing of all. You can argue that we shouldn't celebrate *any* death, but I dispute that many of us truly believe that. Or if they do, then why? I have outlined why I don't think it's the case above. Or you can argue that we shouldn't celebrate *this individual's* death, in which case her politics are completely relevant.
 
Or is it that we simply find celebration of death ""icky"" in some way? I think that is most people's reason, and I don't think it's a good one. But I am genuinely asking, is there a better one?

I think this ties in with the broader question of whether the dead have rights, though I don't think an answer to either question precludes an answer to the other.

I should add, while Thatcher obviously inspired this post, I don't actually particularly want it to be *about* her. I don't think her death improved the world in any noticeable way, so I don't see the point of celebrating.

Every job position usually comes with certain tasks that need to be fulfilled in a day in order for you to keep your job. 

**Example:**
Let's say that on average *Human1* completes all 8 of his tasks to the best of his ability in 6 hours of work. *Human2* completes the same tasks, possibly even better than *Human1*, in 3 hours of work. Yet they both earn the same amount because they are paid on a per hour basis.

Wouldn't a ""per task"" based system benefit everyone more?

Task times could be estimated to an average, so that *Human1* would still earn at least the same amount of income as he was earning on a per hour basis before. 

I do foresee problems with what *Human2* could do after his completion of work but recently I went to a car mechanic and noticed that in his garage he had a large whiteboard with all symptoms and problems of the broken cars parked outside in a **very organised** manner and every mechanic(he employed about 3) went on their own mission to fix as many things as possible and move as many cars in and out of that garage during the day. 

What I am trying to get at is; one could employ a ""Company Task Pool"" with all kinds of random things thrown in there and if you are done with your tasks you can start working on those and earn extra income. And if there are no tasks to fulfil why keep the employees at work longer than they need to? Let them go home to families sooner, or work another job. Either way the work that was given to them was completed and totally satisfactory so there should be no downside to the company?

*Edit:* I guess it would make sense to explain the origin of my contemplations with this idea, for better understanding: I used to work for a gamedev company and I completed a lot of ""grind"" tasks faster than other people in the office and just spent the rest of the time ""pretending"" like I wasn't done. It was a gargantuan waste of time which I could have invested in other tasks or projects that needed doing...

But there is a value that is amiss for me and which is bothersome: discourse.

By discourse I mean a style of arguing which is highly cooperative, the way games of tennis are, and not completely belligerent, the way games of American football or rugby are.

I guess ""discourse"" is like a social science and humanities thing (which could explain its absence in Reddit culture where the hard sciences prevail) but I think it should be a popular thing to value everywhere.  Discourse is cool.

For a community to value discourse, it must teach its members to believe that disagreeing with one another can be fun and productive, that there is an art to disagreement and argumentation, and that we should have pretense for practicing discourse and learning the relevant skills, even if we don't always do it well.

I get frustrated when I try to engage with a fellow Redditor on these terms.  They're usually quick to drop ad hominems and get all huffy.

So my question is, why is discourse a hard thing for large communities like Reddit to maintain?  

Is it in the nature of discourse not to be accessible to more mainstream audiences?  That doesn't seem right to me.  Just because people on the bell curve aren't going to be 100% deft at discourse doesn't mean that it isn't a good pretense for people to strive for.

Is it maybe an American thing?  American culture does seem somewhat impatient with discourse.

Is it just something that, to put it bluntly, only smart people end up valuing?  That also seems wrong; plenty of smart folks are terrible at discoursing and plenty of people with average intelligence have the humbleness and wherewithal to engage in disagreement with a smiling affect.

I am not asking this question on a macro level but rather on a personal one. Public opinion may not be easily swayed but most rational and moral people consider undue harm a moral indiscretion. Harm is certainly done to animals and even those raised in a manner that is ""benevolent"" such as free range farming still end up being killed unnaturally.

I should state that I am a meat eater and I expect I shall continue to do so but ever since I have thought on this topic I have considered myself something of a hypocrite. I am not seeking validation, I am happy with the fact that most lives are filled with a little hypocrisy but I am normally able to come to a decision on topics such as these and I am really stuck on this one.

I briefly toyed with the idea that farming produces way more animals than would occur naturally and as [I believe] there is no afterlife all experiences are positively gained over nothingness therefore the institution of farming causes more utility gained for the animals than non existence would have. It is not that they owe us their lives it is simply that there is a consumer and producer surplus (both parties gain from farming) that would not exist without such a system in place.

I usually try to shy away from arguments that consist solely of people debating which of their speculations are more plausible. One of these sorts of arguments I remember hearing in class was two people arguing over how drinking age affects alcohol abuse.

One said the lower drinking age leads to greater availability and abuse, and the other saying it leads to less social stigma and less abuse. Besides the fact that the culture of the country in discussion is probably inextricably linked to what happens (not that I would know), these are both completely plausible hypotheses and ultimately arguing plausibility is kind of worthless; empirical verification is what's needed, though it can be difficult to supply.

So it got me thinking: As each younger generation adapts to faster and more efficient communication technologies, and as internet globalization means more non-native speakers talking with each other, will simplified spellings and even grammar become more accepted in casual writing, and eventually accepted in formal writing? Maybe in the next hundred years or less? Not by older generations of course, but by new generations who grow tolerant.

It seems the advantage in learning and thumb typing simple phonetic spellings is obvious.  And the only apparent benefit of complex and inconsistent spelling and grammar is a quaint sense of something historic and poetic.

I have noticed two growing trends in the media and American culture that seem to completely contradict themselves. 

TREND 1: There has been a huge backlash against extremely thin models, photoshopping celebrities, and showing anorexic looking models in teen magazines. Editors are being pushed to show ""real women"" with ""real curves"" and un-photoshopped celebrities on their covers. 
 
-examples: the dove campaign for showing ""real women,"" the criticism ralph lauren advertising has gotten for showing super thin and insanely photoshopped models, seventeen and teenvogue magazine being pressured to show un-photoshopped women in their magazines, and the increasing number of sites showing before and after photos of celebrities being photoshopped.

TREND 2: Americans are overweight. We are fat, and our lifestyle is killing us. We eat junk food too often, we eat too many processed foods, we don't exercise enough. People should be eating a plant based diet. People are trying juicing. People should try to be healthy. Diabetes and heart disease rates are skyrocketing. Childhood obesity is an epidemic. 

-examples: Michelle Obama introduced her program to get kids exercising. There is a new food pyramid. There is a new meal guide called ""MyPlate"" showing what a truly well balanced meal should be. There are commercials telling you to ""move"" for ten minutes, three times a day. Food brands are introducing labels that say something is a ""healthy choice"" and are using ingredient labels that are easier to read. NY banned over-size sodas. 


Does anyone else see the contradiction here? I understand that people, women specifically, should try to ""love their bodies"" AND be healthy at the same time. However, it seems as if every single day, american women are being told that their diet needs to change, while at the same time being told that being skinny is ""bad"" and that they should love themselves the way they are.

Please, don't bring soapboxes to this discussion, I'm not after a moral debate about just how a country happened to be populated by the now majority, this is not a question of labeling one race superior to the other, etc. etc.
_____________

In light of the recent statistic that in the last 12 month period there were more non-white babies born within the States than ""white"" babies, I felt this was a relevant question to ask. Do you feel that a racial majority demographic, that has been a major demographic for an extended period of time, should have the right, be it through immigration and citizenship policies, or some other form of action, to actively ensure the status quo is maintained?

Now again, I feel I need to reiterate that this is not a question of racial supremacy, or labeling a single race superior to another. This question is more focused around national identity, does a nation have the right to preserve its identity in the face of a changing demographic balance (read: Do the MAJORITY have the right to preserve their national identity). 

To this end, if the majority within a country do so agree, is it justifiable and moral? Alternatively, do you feel that the inverse of this is actually the correct, moral and ethical, approach? 

**While I've only mentioned the United States above, countries such as Australia are also facing a similar situation whereby future trends show that the once traditional major demographics will in the not too distant future drop below a 50% population contribution. 

Additionally, if you so please, consider countries such as Japan who utilise very strict and enforced immigration policies.

Sites like the descendants of hotornot.com, multiple subreddits on this site, not-quite-but-might-as-well-be-naked shots on Facebook and other social networking sites are really common.

You know the chestnut about ""once it's on the Internet, it's there to stay"".  

I'm 38; that's not nearly old enough to start with an ""in my day..."" bit of reminiscing, but one of the things I was always led to believe was that, in any sort of mainstream career, politics, or other situation where you might be exposed to scrutiny, it was inadvisable to have anything online that might be seen as compromising.  In my lifetime, I saw the rise of the digital camera - before this, nude photos were something that a non-professional would have done either in a pro photo studio as a favor to themselves or a partner, or snapped with a film camera and stored guiltily in a shoebox under the bed - hope the kids never find it.

Strong political opinions or photos taken at a party where you've had a few beers too many are the least of these - and let's face it, in the past 15 years there's been an incredible increase in the number of younger people willing to be less than discreet about showing off their bodies online (and a good thing at that, fnarr fnarr).

On the one hand, people have been arguing for greater sexual liberation and freedom for many decades - and ""libertine"" and ""repressive"" trends concerning sex and nudity have come in cycles throughout modern history.  Not to mention that your parents were probably a lot less prude than you might think.  

On the other, there's always this implicit ""badness"" about someone discovering a naked snapshot of a CEO or respected politician online and posting it on a scandal-site, a tabloid paper, or some other titillating context.

But the massive spread of camera phones, photo sites, and other technological innovations makes it much easier to snap yourself in a ""yeah, still got it"" moment when coming out of the shower or in bed, and for anyone from yourself (full consent) to a voyeur or angry ex (zero consent) to share it with the world.  And boom, it's out there.

So, tons of boobies and other fleshy bits out there, millions more every day.

I've always been a big supporter of the right to privacy and such. Constantly fighting against all the various laws and government acts that try to spy on us and so forth. However, while I support this 'right to privacy', I don't really know why I do it. It's one of those things I just defend because it seems like the sort of thing I should defend.  

You see, while I think other people should have their privacy, I have absolutely no use for it. I don't keep (my own) secrets or anything.

Only exceptions being secrets I'm keeping for other people, of course. I just can't bring myself to actually care about what people know about me. If I found something shameful, I wouldn't do it or otherwise be involved with it.

* 1. Having sexual contact with minors is psychologically detrimental to them and therefore the entertainment of such thoughts is to be avoided
* 2. Being sexually attracted to someone that is physically underdeveloped is unnatural
* 3. Being sexually attracted to someone that is psychologically underdeveloped is unnatural

---

I would like to tackle the latter two points.

**2. physical underdevelopment**

* I understand that attraction towards pre-pubescent minors is considered unnatural, where I think there is a problem is the fact that there is a large age range where minors (especially females) reach a certain level of sexual attractiveness, anywhere from 14-18. Is it considered pedophilia to find a 15 year old sexually attractive if she appears to be 20? Physically, there is often no difference between a 15 year old and a 20 year old. Which leads me to my second point --

**3. Psychological underdevelopment**

* Much of the perceived difference between a 15 year old and a 20 year old who are physically similar is psychological. Referring to (1): sexual activity for a 13-15 year old may not be a good idea because of the psychological instability of a young teenager.

However, we are not talking about the sexual act in and of itself here. We are talking about pedophilia - the *attraction* to said age. You are not required to act on your urges to be known as a pedophile, you are merely required to find said age range attractive.

So my question is as follows:

Why do people think it is unnatural for an adult to be sexually attracted to a physically developed minor when the only criteria differentiating this minor from a young woman are age and psychological maturity -- both arbitrary when considering purely physical sexual attraction?",,False,,t5_2smsq,False,,,True,t3_u8591,http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/u8591/regarding_pedophilia/,

Even if we *did* decide to go through with eugenics, at this point, the potential benefits to society would take far longer to manifest than the benefits of biological engineering and transhumanism. 

Eugenics would take multiple generations and is a very hit-or-miss technique. On the other hand, we will see major strides in biological engineering and transhumanism in the next century, in the next 50 years, in the next decade, because through biological engineering, we improve ourselves rather than improve the offspring we breed.

Or so I think, I may be wrong. But the pill has done wonders in transforming the role of women in modern society. It has helped revolutionize our modern society by de-coupling sex from reproduction, giving women more freedom to pursue the kind of life that they want. It's also helped married couples have more control over their circumstances. But even with the pill and all our modern forms of contraception and birth control, we still haven't fully de-coupled sex from reproduction.

But about when we eventually do? This is a very strong possibility, if you consider how far off we've actually gone in the past hundred years. Before the 20th century preventing conception was nowhere near as common or as safe as it is today. Birth control was more effective then by comparison, but was still risky. And don't get me started on the brutality of abortion practices and the high risks that they once involved. Also, I started reading Huxley's Brave New World like, five minutes ago and I've just finished the part about the hatcheries and the Bokanovsky process. It was awesome.

Hypothetically de-coupling sex from reproduction would take some form of sterilization, essentially making both types of sex cells unable to perform their natural functions. This would mean that through the likely use of pharmaceuticals, we can prevent sperm cells from being motile enough to reach an egg cell (or some other mechanism). And also prevent an egg cell from being viable (or some other mechanism). Then, we would likely use in-vitro fertilization (or some other similar method) and use artificial organs (or maybe not) to incubate offspring.

So, would that further revolutionize human society; freeing us from the burden of our biology, and helping usher in a new age of human productivity, knowledge and achievement? Or would it make us more arbitrary with our morals, since sex could now be appropriated for whatever role we could think of it, essentially opening us to more hedonistic tendencies?

Would you visit a community center called church if it were presented as pantheist?,45,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/kgil1/i_miss_church_would_you_visit_a_community_center/,"As a kid my family was heavily involved in the church. Once I hit adulthood that was something I left behind but there is one piece I still miss and that is the sense of community fostered in the church. Being involved in or regularly attending church allows you to meet members of your community you wouldn't otherwise interact with. Since it's something people go to regularly it's also a great place for friendships to develop and networking to occur. As a kid, events were a blast and Wednesday evening clubs was always something to look forward to. Aside from games, stories and music, I got to do cool stuff like wood work, slot car racing, soap stone carving and field trips.

If there is a secular parallel I'm unaware of it.

Now, why pantheist? Mostly just to make it more palatable to current theists. Obviously avid monotheists would be unlikely to make the jump but those folks who consider themselves non-denominational christians, or ""spiritual but not religious"" or who are otherwise loosely affiliated with the church may find pantheist more palatable than a strictly secular community center. It also seems like the idea that nature is deserving of reverence* would be something more palatable for secularists as opposed to say, zombie jesus.

What would a ""pantheist church"" do? For the sake of my thought experiment I'd expect a couple of key areas:

* Developing that reverence and understanding of nature - think Carl Sagan, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, David Attenborough. Building layman understanding and appreciation for science and the world around us
* Personal development - Not sure what this would look like but something to develop 'soft skills' would replace the idea of spiritual development (though might be branded as such)
* Community development - both fostering the sense of community and focusing on giving back. Something the church does today, but without the ""you'll go to hell if you don't"" aspect. This part would include social gatherings and much ""sacrimental"" wine.

Would something like this be anything anyone would be interested in?


On the idea that nature is deserving of reverence: after the big bang cooled we were left with black and white Lego blocks. Add 13.x billion years, a bit of gravity, and it's self-assembled into us. How is that not the coolest thing imaginable?

- Limited resources will run out, which will make physical transportation and large-scale tasks much more expensive

- Mass-production using specialized machinery will be obsoleted by general 3D printers in most homes

- Food production might move from ""natural and slaughtered"" to lab-grown, which could lead to consistent food quality without needing to get it from a restaurant chain

- Menial jobs will increasingly be replaced by AI and machinery

With that in mind, wouldn't the solution be to start moving our economy towards creative and intellectual endeavors that can't be replicated by a computer, or towards entertainment like how Twitch TV does crowd-funded playthroughs of video games? It's the kind of thing parents frown upon, but will ""getting a real job"" really work 10-20 years down the road?

There will also likely be a drastic increase in demand for artists and designers once 3D printers start to take off, and it suddenly becomes economically feasible to have toys custom-made for your kids instead of having to choose from a limited set of mass-produced stuff. So that's another line of work that is currently frowned upon (""starving artists"") but probably shouldn't be.

And of course we'll always have a need for engineers and programmers to create the devices and games (along with all the creative work that goes into those), as well as people for maintenance, distribution, marketing, and support. And guidance counselors and whatnot for personal affairs. Nothing new there.

For the purposes of the mental exercise, I usually give myself limited magical powers.

Often a lot of the problems boil down to human nature: envy, avarice, jealousy, violence, etc. Added to that, it's very hard to ensure justice. Even if I could wave my hand and ""disable"" stealing, it might be unfair to people who steal because they're starving, and so on.

One ""long-term"" solution I had was after thinking about how best to differentiate between a person who steals just to feed himself or his kids, and someone who, say, cold-bloodedly swindles people out of their retirement money. The best factor I could find was ""empathy"" or a lack thereof. 

For the purposes of this question, empathy can be summed up as ""being able to put yourself in the other persons shoes"", experiencing their pain, experiencing their joy, etc. I feel that this is something absent in all those people whom we consider ""cold-blooded"" or ""heartless"".

So, hypothetically, if ~~we had a way to measure empathy or the absence thereof in the fetus and aborted any below a certain baseline~~ the chance of a fetus to have a successful birth was magically linked to the ""potential empathy level"", would the world become a better place in a couple of generations?

I see the same themes arising in every thread however, many people will recommend, say, St. Vincents, as a reputable charity that will help people at the local level. People will then reply and say things like ""yes, but this charity does not support homosexuality, or gay marriage etc, so do not donate to them"". Logically religious affiliated charities are not going to support gay rights, but even if this philosophical stance by the charities does not effect anything, people still feel the need to disqualify the charity as being ""good"", and resultantly feel it is not fit for receiving a donation.

So my question becomes, do you feel that if a charity has a philosophical creed at the upper levels, which does not effect how it operates on the ground level (ie. gay homeless people still get access to sleeping facilities and free meals), then this should factor into determining donations etc? Or as I said in the title of this question, should a charity have to not offend a single person in order to be deemed charitable? Do the end results of the charity define it as good, or does its philosophical stance do such a thing?

Regardless, in this hypothetical situation, *every human will die*. How will our cultural history be preserved, and how will the population come to terms with extinction?

### Information preservation
How do we preserve our information for a new species (either terrestrial or extraterrestrial) to find? When the Library of Alexandria was burned, humanity entered the dark ages. Are there any preventative measures we can take to prevent this again? Is there a medium which could preserve vast amounts of information that we've accumulated throughout our existence? If this exists, where would we store it; in orbit, or aboard a spacecraft headed to a distant galaxy?

In addition, what information would we store? We would need to question who the information's audience would be. If it's for a terrestrial species, what do we include to get them up-to-date with our current knowledge? Or, for an extraterrestrial species, what do we include that provides cultural significance? Would we store DNA samples so, hopefully, we could be reconstructed?

Yes, I've seen the Star Trek: TNG episode, ""The Inner Light."" Even though that was a fictional work, how would it compare to the ""reality"" of our hypothetical demise?

### Acceptance of extinction by the population
This is an enormous issue: how will people handle knowing the entire species will die swiftly? Will governmental measures be taken to assist those who choose suicide? How will panic be handled?

The ""star witness"" for the prosecution has stirred up a ton of controversy. She doesn't speak using mainstream English and the defense has jumped on that. I've heard that she grew up speaking Spanish/Creole. So there are clear language and cultural differences between her and a lot of people in that courtroom: the lawyers, the judge, probably the jury.

A linguistics expert on NPR talked about how a lot of critical information is just lost because the jury might not understand her dialect. Something as basic as a ""yes/no"" response to ""did you hear Trayvon say 'get off me'"" is ambiguous depending on if you're familiar with her ""dialect.""

If Zimmerman is found innocent, then I think that her testimony will be pointed to as a contributing factor.

So my question:

REGARDLESS of your personal opinion on whether Zimmerman is guilty or innocent, should these factors even matter for the case?

I feel like ""character judgments"" are so enormously subjective, and we judge extra harshly on people who come from different backgrounds. They might speak in a way that irritates us, they might not share our cultural norms on politeness, they might say ""God willing"" or ""thank Allah"" as a verbal tic, they might say condescending things about women, or cuss a lot as a normal matter of course.

Our judgments of people are often really shallow and it frustrates me that our justice system relies so heavily on flair, pomp, and charisma. I'm not exactly the most charismatic guy around, so it scares me that if I'm ever accused of something, that would count so strongly against me in a jury trial. Or if I'm called up to testify about someone killing my friend, and all of a sudden my nervousness and my verbal tics and my awkward habits are part of an arsenal to be used against me.

In reaction to our society's history of racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry, we've created laws and restrictions that are aimed at helping to counter these influences in society. These are the laws I wish to discuss - the ones that are aimed at helping to improve conditions for a group of people in society who have been specifically targeted and are disadvantaged in some way. 

I would say it is generally true (if not always) that these laws provide an advantage to the groups they target in our society, one designed to help counteract previous negative influences. If we accept that is true, then it follows that these laws discriminate against people who fall outside of the group - by providing more aid to a specific group that is denied to another group, we increase the quality of life for one group at the expense of another.

Now, this is generally justified because the quality of life for one group is simply so low that it is worthwhile (by utilitarian ethics) sacrificing some of the upper quality of life of one group to that another can have the most basic.

The best example of this process is affirmative action: as racism was keeping many black people out of a job, it was decided to make policies to give black people preference when the cases were roughly equal. The impact on white people was thought to be very insignificant as they are able to get many jobs.

My questions for discussion are:

1. Do you agree with the above? Do you have a different take on how these laws come into society and evolve?
2. Do you think there comes a point where these types of laws would need to be changed or removed? That they cause more harm than good?
3. What criteria should we use in society to determine if it's time for these laws to be changed? What signs in society should we look for?
4. Do you think there are anti-discrimination or protective laws in place today that should be altered or removed?
5. Do you feel it is better to make laws that improve conditions for a single group or laws that generally improve conditions for everyone? Is there another possibility you would have society consider?

There are few things we ever do that cannot be linked, however indirectly, to status-seeking. The only other drive that permeates human behavior so deeply, as evolutionary psychologists will attest to, is reproduction.

It also happens to be one of the chief reasons why we can't have nice things.

Think of the Milgram experiment and how subjects were so eager to affiliate with high status scientists that they were willing to zap an innocent stranger into unconsciousness. Think of the hundreds of millions of people exhausting themselves and wasting resources just so they can have more expensive stuff than the Joneses. From the small evils of everyday life, such as gossip, overt or covert bullying, or insufferable bosses, to the great evils of humanity such as war and totalitarianism, everything boils down to status one way or the other. (Of course, a behavioural economist would argue that it's also one of the great engines of productivity, but I really don't think the positive externalities are worth the negative ones, or that there is no other way to obtain them.)

Status-seeking is probably the single largest component of the notorious ""human nature"" that utopians are always said to fail to account for. This says a lot about what we're missing out on because of this pesky trait.

So. My objective is to improve the social landscape by not perpetuating the status-seeking behaviors that so often make human existence needlessly nasty and competitive, while still having a satisfying life and not being a doormat. These are my questions:

 * Is it really possible for a human to attempt to identify, and cease, all behaviors that are driven by status-seeking (dominance of others, submission to others, affiliation with high-status people, inclination to make choices primarily for status reasons etc.)?
 * Since people are programmed not to be conscious of their own status-seeking, or to think of status games in conscious, explicit terms, does one have any hopes of correctly identifying all of one's own status-seeking behaviors?
 * Is status-seeking a game which you lose by default if you attempt to opt out of it? If so, will the consequences of the low-status position thus acquired be undesirable enough to the person so that they decide to play the status game after all?
 * Is it possible to convince others than yourself of the need to eliminate the drive for status? Are people, even the educated and progressive sort, likely to interpret it as an attempt to lower *their* status?
 * From your experience, are there other people out there with the goal of eliminating their own drive for status?

These two paragraphs in particular made me think of it:

&gt;Until now, we have always had large reserves of the imaginary, because the coefficient of reality is proportional to the imaginary, which provides the former with its specific gravity. This is also true of geographical and space exploration: when there is no more virgin ground left to the imagination, when the map covers all the territory, something like the reality principle disappears. The conquest of space constitutes, in this sense, an irreversible threshold which effects the loss of terrestrial coordinates and referentiality. Reality, as an internally coherent and limited universe, begins to hemorrhage when its limits are stretched to infinity. The conquest of space, following the conquest of the planet, promotes either the de-realizing of human space, or the reversion of it into a simulated hyperreality. Witness, for example, this two-room apartment with kitchen and bath launched into orbit with the last Moon capsule (raised to the power of space, one might say); the perceived ordinariness of a terrestrial habitat then assumes the values of the cosmic and its hypostasis in Space, the satellization of the real in the transcendence of Space—it is the end of metaphysics, the end of fantasy, the end of SF. The era of hyperreality has begun.

&gt;From this point on, something must change: the projection, the extrapolation, this sort of pantographic exuberance which made up the charm of SF are now no longer possible. It is no longer possible to manufacture the unreal from the real, to create the imaginary from the data of reality. The process will be rather the reverse: to put in place ""decentered"" situations, models of simulation, and then to strive to give them the colors of the real, the banal, the lived; to reinvent the real as fiction, precisely because the real has disappeared from our lives. A hallucination of the real, of the lived, of the everyday—but reconstituted, sometimes even unto its most disconcertingly unusual details, recreated like an animal park or a botanical garden, presented with transparent precision, but totally lacking substance, having been derealized and hyperrealized.

Or in other words, ""...to reinvent the real as fiction."" 

Furthermore, are we presented with the chicken/egg scenario?  Was the virtual reality of the video game installed onto my mind and thus programmed me to order things in my life accordingly or was it the manifestation of ordering that lead to the creation of such a game?

1363618542.0,25,self.InsightfulQuestions,1aiyk3,About the question of women's appearance &amp; owning their bodies,49,24,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/1aiyk3/about_the_question_of_womens_appearance_owning/,"It is often the case in debates about rape that one party will resort to the argument of ""the woman was asking for it since she was using provocative clothes"". Of course, this argument, in the case of rape, is not a good one since surveys (however representative rape survey are because of problems with underreporting of rapes) tend to show that most rapes happen between people who know each other well, mostly inside houses, and when the victim does not wear such provocative clothes.

People will then argue that, even though provocative clothes are not the main reason explaining such a vile act, they tend to objectify women, and make men ""belligerent"" (for lack of a better word). Feminists (and others) will respond that women can choose to wear whatever they please, because they (rightly) own their bodies. I believe this is the case.

In the context of social or work relationships, men are not supposed to talk to women in order to convey a sexual subtext, because women feel that such a language is predatory and forces the dominance of men unto them.

Now is my question: in as much as women own their body &amp; thus can choose however they love to dress, I feel that the way we dress is in itself a language, &amp; that women who dress overtly provocatively convey a subtext of sex &amp; dominance (""this is my beautiful body, &amp; you need to desire it""), just as a man who somehow pathetically would go to a girl in a bar &amp; would tell her that he has, say, a huge penile apparatus, would convey sex &amp; dominance. Why don't we look at those two way of conveying meaning -- the verb &amp; the appearance -- as equal in this case?

Why would it be socially unacceptable for, say, a man to project a sexual dominance through words, but that would be okay for, say, a woman wearing provocative clothes? In other terms, why wouldn't it be regarded as bullying to have women wearing overtly provocative clothes, just as it would rightly be seen as bullying to have men wander and tell every girl about his penis?

**EDIT**: to clarify, I know that my example is not perfect, and I actually prefer a society where women dress however they want, but still I wanted to have your opinion on why some messages (not necessarily consciously sent, but still messages that are received by others) would be accepted, while seemingly other roughly equivalent unconscious or not messages (for instance, a rich guy overtly showing his wealth, or a man directing attention at his package) would be construed as a*hole or childish? Is that just because people (and men in particular) profit from the fact that women dress provocatively (because most people find that arousing) and rich guys or men directing attention to their package only really provoke negative reactions from others? And in this way, shouldn't women feel the opposite way about showing their bodies, in that it seems that ""society allows"" that (rather than showing your wealth, etc) simply because men seem to enjoy it (&amp; therefore profit from the woman body)?  

**EDIT**: the more I think about it, the more I have these ideas that come back:

 - I think what I meant to ask is in what way should we define bullying, is that when we know *intent* of bullying people (eg. this guy consciously did that to piss someone off) or when you observe the fact that people feel not at ease when you do something, even though you can be doing it unconsciously (because what you are doing provokes a chemical reaction in others). In this case, women dressing overtly provocatively might create a strong frustration feeling in others bodies, and make them feel ill-at-ease, should that be bullying?

 - another reflexion that I have is that of hypnotism: if someone masters the art of hypnosis &amp; can, using his craft, make the woman feel good and provoke in her a feeling of attraction to him, I get the sense that most people would see that as *cheating* and a dangerous behavior (no one wants to have a mad hypnotist wandering in the bar where every people go), but if a woman dress provocatively, she in a sense does exactly the same: by provoking a chemical reaction that is wired in the male brain, she effectively hypnotises men to be sexually attracted to her, but in this case it is not seen as equal to the hypnotist case by society?

Again, I precise: I'm not a prude, nor do I care about women dressing provocatively (I'm rather the kind to like it), I'm just trying to deconstruct how this seems to me to be like other interactions in society that are naturally regarded as bullying, &amp; trying to understand what differences make that it is construed as acceptable?  

**EDIT**: other thoughts for food

 - it seems in the thread that most people make a strong difference between verbal &amp; non-verbal (whether conscious or unconscious) communication, in that verbal seems to be direct &amp; unavoidable by the other party, &amp; therefore stronger, while ""nobody forces you to look at an overtly provocatively dressed woman"" -- it might be the case, however I have the feeling that biology does force you to look at the provocatively dressed woman (and that she somehow knows it, see the discussion about why women feel good when they dress in ways that men find attractive below: http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/1aiyk3/about_the_question_of_womens_appearance_owning/c8xz0dn), &amp; second I don't really see why non-verbal communication should be seen as less intense (for instance protesting in a church by standing topless etc ) than verbal communication
 - an interesting parallel could be advertisement: nobody forces you to look at it, but many people feel aggressed by it &amp; some want to forbid it in the streets or other places -- in this case it is because the overt presence of commercial panels provokes unpleasant reactions (frustration etc) &amp; they want to get rid of that, and nobody can just ""not look at the advertisement"" because (and this is different from the case of overtly provocative girls that is not so widespread &amp; is generally limited to late-night bars etc ) it is simply everywhere

As I'm studying Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, I, along with others in my literature class have made the observation that the New World citizens have nearly ceased to be ""human.""  Of course, I use the word *nearly* because it seems that even within the brainwashed citizens there is a ""human"" urge which is typically repressed by everyone except for Bernard.  

Since I don't always get to engage in insightful discussion in high school, I wanted to hear what you guys think:

What does it mean to be human?  What is it about those brainwashed citizens that leads us to believe that there is something inherently inhuman about them?  Does technology play a big role in this?

In the context of Brave New World, I see my ""humanness"" as the opportunity to be an individual, and to reap the benefits of others' individuality.  In many animals, I think we see that the urge to promote the species or the colony or the pack over the aspirations of the individual (if the creature is even complex enough to have aspirations).  In more complex animals, we see more individuality, but of course there is not nearly as much capacity to be an individual.  

Human individuality allows us to create art and literature and music and create things no animal can.  This individuality may be what leads many to see the arts as the most ""human"" endeavors.

1336774381.0,27,self.InsightfulQuestions,tiufo,Verbs and Nouns: How should we talk about differences and tolerance?,33,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/tiufo/verbs_and_nouns_how_should_we_talk_about/,"I've been thinking a lot this week about discrimination and how we talk about it.

I've noticed that the tenor of conversation around discrimination and tolerance, and the consensus that develops from the conversation, is informed by how we view the thing that should be accepted or disavowed. It boils down to whether the thing is a Noun or a Verb.

I started to notice this with [a recent thread on r/TrueReddit.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/tffmm/we_frame_peoples_bodies_as_physical/) The consensus among those involved in that conversation was that fat people deserve the scorn and discrimination they experience because obesity is an unhealthy and offensive lifestyle choice that causes direct and indirect harm to society. The (small) minority of dissenters argued that fat people are people just like the rest of us, and are deserving of basic levels of respect and dignity. The difference here is that, for the first group, being fat referred to a set of behaviors that these people chose to engage in willingly, and thus bear complete responsibility for whatever consequences arise; and for the second group, being fat was part of a set of circumstances that a person found themselves in, sometimes of their own doing and sometimes not (and sometimes a combination of both), and thus assigning blame to them is not necessarily appropriate. In other words, for the people who support Fat Discrimination, being fat is a thing that you *do*; and for the people who support Fat Acceptance, being fat is a thing that you *are*.

It occurred to me that this is very similar to how we talk about the LGBT community. For supporters of gay rights, being gay is a thing that you *are*- it's an indelible part of one's identity, much like race or ethnicity. In contrast, opponents of gay rights believe that being gay refers to a set of behaviors that people chose to engage in willingly (and, crucially, that these behaviors cause direct and indirect harm to society). In other words, it's a thing that they *do*, and if they would only stop doing it, we would all be better off. One interesting thing here is how much the consensus around the national conversation about gay rights has shifted over time. In the past, gay was a Verb, and as a corollary the stigma around homosexuality was strong. Over time, as the gay rights movement gained steam, 'gay' shifted from being a Verb to being a Noun. I believe this shift in how we talked about gay people resulted in the shifting and evolving national consensus *in favor* of gay rights.

I want to return briefly to the fat discrimination point. Opponents of Fat Acceptance insist that fat people bear an urgent and immediate moral imperative to change their behavior in order to lessen their burden on society- in other words, to *stop being fat.* Supporters of Fat Acceptance argue that obesity, at its most pronounced, bears similarites to a disability by pointing out the scale of challenges involved in substantial weight loss (with some comparing it to trying to regain motor and cognitive functions following a debilitating stroke). Opponents tend to strongly denounce this argument, either by citing a (medically dubious) mantra of ""calories in/calories out"" to illustrate that losing weight is in fact very simple, or simply by saying that characterizing obesity as a form of disability ""lets them off the hook"" too easily. Again, they insist that because obesity is a conscious choice (or, at best, the direct result of other conscious choices), that they could choose something else easily, and the fact that they haven't makes them morally deficient (and, thus, deserving of scorn).

But let's look at another Noun/Verb question in relation to this. Let's look at religion. Things like race, gender, and (increasingly, in terms of how we talk about it) sexual orientation are seen as clearly fixed qualities unaffected by the conscious choice of the individual. Religious affiliation, however, is a choice. While children can be compelled to attend church or temple by their parents with little opportunity to appeal, once an individual reaches the age of majority, they have complete control over their own religious affiliation (or lack thereof). In a very real sense, religion is a choice. Further, if we put aside the difficulties of crises of faith and normative social pressure (merely for the sake of discussion, not to in any way dismiss how difficult it is to wrestle with these issues), addressing religious affiliation is more immediately actionable than addressing obesity. Losing weight requires years of commitment and a significant recalibration of your lifestyle, but you can choose to stop going to church *right this instant.* Yet, at least in a public policy sense, religion is seen as a Noun, and not a Verb. Religious affiliation is considered part of your personal identity, and your particular affiliation (or lack thereof) explicitly does not exclude you from equal protection under the law. In a broader sense, the Noun/Verb question with regards to religion varies among people. Among the steadfastly irreligious, religious affiliation is strictly a choice, a Verb, and that the religious among us bear an urgent and immediate moral imperative to change their behavior in order to lessen their burden on society. Individuals among certain groups of the religious (notably, members of the American Christian Right) see their own religious affiliation as a Noun (""I am a Christian""), and the religious affiliations of those outside their broader faith community as a Verb (""You, Jew/Muslim/Buddhist/Wiccan, are willingly engaging in a set of behaviors that cause direct and indirect harm to society, and you must stop"").

Of course, being a Noun doesn't necessarily act as a shield against scorn and derision. We see this most plainly in our conversations around race and gender. They are both overwhelmingly considered Nouns (one *is* black, one *is* a woman). And yet, despite much improvement over the past fifty years, discrimination against women and non-whites is still pervasive and toxic.

Nevertheless, I believe it's clear that, if we want to live in a Just and Equitable Society, and that if we want to seriously address issues of discrimination in society, we need to deeply and critically examine how we talk about differences. Specifically, we need to examine what we decide are Identities and what are Behaviors, and what role each plays in supporting or impugning tolerance of our differences.",,False,,t5_2smsq,True,,,True,t3_tiufo,http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/tiufo/verbs_and_nouns_how_should_we_talk_about/,

The two I can think of is 1. the brain in a vat problem (or better known as the matrix problem) and 2. that the basic rules of logic are correct.

So the brain in a vat problem is set up much like the matrix, where your brain is connected to a matrix-like program and all your senses and perceptions are constructs of the program.  Personally, and this is coming from a complete layman and armchair philosopher, I don't see a concrete proof that we are not in such a situation.  Don't we at a certain level just need to assume that we are what we appear, human beings living in bodies surrounded by an objective, provable universe?  

For the rules of logic, I don't really have a scenario but don't we at a certain level just need to assume that “If A then B therefore C” are correct?  Or that our understanding of arithmetic and algebra or even basic number theory is correct?  Or at least correct enough to build a foundation on?

And before I get jumped on, I'm not a religious man and I know the original question was more an attack against the atheist community (of which I am a proud member), but I think the question is a valid one.

And for a little bit of context, I'm writing a story and there is a person in the story whose world view I am trying to base on science but he will have one very basic truth and build everything on that truth.  Right now the basic truth I'm trying to build on is proof, or having evidence for everything.  But I'm kind of stuck because I think even that basic truth makes the assumption that we live in a universe where we can provide a valid proof for a hypothesis and that the methods we have to prove something are valid ways in which to prove something.  Am I wrong in thinking this?

I thought of posting in /r/philosophy but sometimes the responses can get too esoteric for my armchair level of understanding.


**final edit:**  I probably should have just slept on this after getting those first answers.  So to answer the question, No science doesn't make any assumptions.  Science looks at the evidence, attempts to make a system that mimics what it sees, tests the results, and changes the system to better predict what actually happens.  To counter the 2 examples I gave, all evidence points to us not being brains in a vat and the rules of logic working like how they do and until there is convincing evidence to the contrary, it is just idle speculation.

Are we then likely to treat similar situations/challenges, like being a parent, the same way? Could it also be that, if we in fact are more likely to treat our children the way we were treated as a child, we do it because we are subconsciously retreating to behaviours that we are familiar with? Is it perhaps to avenge our own bad childhood?

On the other side, if we grow aversion towards a certain environment (like a hostile household, abuse etc), can we count on avoiding it as our course of action/reaction when faced with the same situations/challenges (again, parenting is tough)?

We need to know why abortion was made illegal.  Let's say it's because we redefined the term 'person' or 'personhood'.  A fetus has rights as early as detectable.

There are a lot of things to address in these instances.  

Would they make fetus certificates instead of birth certificates?  What other paper work would be created?
How much would the abortion rate go down?
Adoption would probably bloat.  This might be an incentive to overhaul the adoption process, make it less expensive, easier, and decrease the wait time.

The life of the fetus would have rights, obviously those rights would be a higher priority than a woman's right to choose.  The scariest thing that would come out of this would probably be people trying to control women's health and lives during those 9 months.

Would anything positive come out of this from a societal stand point.  Whether or not you are currently prochoice or prolife, is there anything positive that you can think of?  Maybe money that was previously used for anti-abortion ads and marketing would be put into better avenues.

What bureaucratic messes would arise?

Would you have to be a resident to get an abortion in that state, or could you simply go to an abortion friendly state and then drive back to your residents.

What can be the - probably pyschological - reason?",36,15,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/184hss/given_how_huge_the_fitness_industry_is_and_how/,"I mean still most people live unhealthy lives despite that you can hardly open any copy of any magazine today, printed mags or online like MSN, without some articles about exercise and eating well in the lifestyle section.

What does the fitness industry do wrong?

I suspect they focus too much on the science of what is good for your body, and neglect psychology, motivating people, getting people in the mood, changing minds so that we enjoy playing some sport better than  eating ourselves full and getting drunk... 

I think it is mostly because the fitness industry is ran by people who always loved to be fit, never needed much motivation.

For example I think they focus too little on exercises that have some external goal other than just getting fit which makes them more fun:

- playing basketball with your friends (external goal is scoring)
- skiing (external goal is enjoying the speed)

and so on. So the industry needs to make exercise **FUN**.


Similarly, the fitness industry is full of ex-athletes who always had some kind of a healthy diet. And they do not understand how we normal people don't simply have worse diets but _no diet at all_. That we simply do not like to be conscious about what we eat, we haven no idea what yesterdays lunch was and todays will be, we just eat randomly, unconsciously. So they somehow need to get us in the _mood_  of not simply a better diet but _generally having a diet_ i.e. somehow get us in the mood for enjoying knowing what eat, enjoying conscious eating, enjoying paying attention to eating out, shopping for food, cooking.

This is something they don't understand. They just say ""eat no more than x g of carbs a day"". But we normal people do not eat ""carbs"". We don't think of it this way. In fact we don't like thinking about it at all. We are eating a sandwich for breakfast, hot dog for lunch and a pasta for dinner. Not ""carbs"". They are used to seeing a meal as a set of nutrients, we see a meal as a meal: a stuff you buy prepared or cook following a family recipe.

So either they must change our view to see carbs and proteins everywhere and not see it as salad or hot dog, and make us enjoy this paying  attention, or of course they could do the other way around, and simply make easy rules that do not require much consciousness of eating for example, and be followed with a little practice unconsciously, so we can eat healthier without having a diet, without paying attention:

- you will use XYZ instead of bread for your sandwich

- you will get one small burger at McD and a side of garden salad, and the drink will be water or coke zero

- you will cut out beer and if you really need a drink after work to unwind, make it no more than one large pub glass of dry wine

etc.

I this second approach would work much easier. I don't like the consciousness approach, it is a too radical change to go ""zero based budgeting"" and plan my meals according to what they contain instead of eating randomly as my whim dictates. But I could follow a simple set of unconscious rules that say ""Bzzt! Bread! Wrong! In this situation use X instead of bread!""

Another way of thinking about this question is whether the greedy CEO is a founding myth of left-leaning parties in the same way that welfare queens are an anti-idol of the right-leaning ones. The evidence suggests that welfare queens don't exist, despite anecdotes to the contrary -- do people who like reading The Guardian (like myself) have an equally appalling blind spot towards those who hire?

As a bit of preamble, I suppose I'm having this suspicion that those of us in the West, especially the UK and the US, are constantly told we must compete to pay our way in the world and that if you want a job, you shouldn't grumble about training for far longer and far harder than your parents did for less of a payoff in many cases. Nor should you grumble that your jobs are more transient and career progression within the same firm seems to be a long-gone dream, much like pensions and, increasingly, the welfare state.

So while these things are painted as foolish fantasies of the already declining West, which we must now clean up after and rectify in the face of a growing East, the corporate equivalents are ever strengthened. I suppose the correlates are tax rates for CEOs, the apparent opt-in taxation for multinational companies and the enforcement of trivial patents plus the tolerance of anti-union practices. Instead of being dismissed as fantasies of the pre-welfare state era, they are forever being protected, rather than firms being told they must adapt or be left behind.

A second case: abortions are sometimes performed upon discovery that the fetus will have an extreme physical defect or low-quality-of-life.

My question poses a comparison between these two cases. Is there an ethical difference between choosing to abort a fetus based on its gender and aborting a fetus based on physical defects?

Is the answer even binary?

In the sense of: unconscious eating of random food and drinking of random drinks including alcohol, usually processed or fast food, when we cook, we cook whatever recipes we learned from our parents and were see as our normal ethnic food in our family i.e. the Italian family eats pasta, the Hungarian goulash, the Indian curry, the whole process is unconscious.

Here, the difficult part is not choosing the low-fat diet the experts suggested in 1960, the low-carb they suggest now, the paleo, the keto, the vegan, or anything, but having a diet at all!

Maybe the experts think people move from one diet to another, they go low-fat, then paleo, then try vegan. If they think that, they are deluded: that would be easy. Going from no-diet to diet is the hard part! Chucking most fast and processed food, forgetting your moms recipes, eating stuff that will usually feel disturbingly **foreign** because it is not what your mom cooked for you, spend time reading labels, cooking every food from scratch and so on.

We had a vegan girl living with us, and it looked very hard to me, not because she had a vegan diet but because she had a diet at all! Plain simply the whole concept of eating (and drinking) took a lot bigger chunk from her time and attention and freedom than me who would just walk into a grocery store, stuff a random sandwich in my mouth in 2 minutes and then I am free to do something else. Or I could go arestaurant and simply order the daily offer without thinking twice. She always had this awkward questions ""what is in your vegetable lasagna?""  that made waiters smile awkwardly (they thought ""what a blue stocking! why cannot every girl live on caesar salad!"") and it would be even more awkward for me being a manly man, if fat, so my natural, expected behavior is MOAR burger and beer.

Anyone the point is not that this or that diet is hard, it is more like diets are hard, all of the, opposed to random eating.

**And the diet experts don't tell you this!** They give you a list of ingredients then bye. They don't tell you how to go from random meals mostly others prepare to deal with ingredients and figure out what to do with them, invest time, attention, and eat the end result that feels foreign because your mom did not cook this. 

So far I could figure out only one way to deal with it. Be hungry. Fast. Skip breakfast, maybe even lunch. This saves a lot of time, attention, and now that you are really hungry now you are willing to invest time and attention to eating. And being really hungry, you will feel grateful for even for food that totally does not taste like your moms cooking. We are picky eaters because we are not hungry. A hungry man would gladly down a plate of steamed vegs.

So I am picking up this intermittent fasting thing, as in 0 calories from 22:00 to 14:00.

I know this all because I remember that the only diet that ever worked for me did include fasting. I was supposed to drink only this shake for 3 days and zero solid food. I was so hungry my eyes were falling out, so after 3 days when for 1 week it allowed a very light dinner like and apple with two crackers I was like wow, a whole apple, real food in my stomach! I was not complaining that that apple does not taste like moms goulash (we are Hungarians, replace it with the foods of your ethnicity/nationality). I was grateful for it and felt like heavenly manna. And I lost 15kg while gaining muscle. It was the only diet that worked, because it incorporated fasting, and fasting made me value and respect food. It was like 3 days no food just shake, 1 week shake, shake, dinner, 1 week shake, lunch, dinner etc.

So I guess this may be like the magic trick from going from no diet to diet. Any diet.",,False,,t5_2smsq,False,,,True,t3_1hmjyt,http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/1hmjyt/why_dont_the_experts_giving_out_diet_advice/,

It knows nothing about what it computes. We can represent knowledge that is significant to us via bits of 0s and 1s. But these bit strings are absolutely meaningless until they are interpreted by us. Once interpreted, they may become a movie or an application or a game. We *assign* meaning to all that data stored in the machine. It has no intrinsic meaning. Therefore it doesn't really seem plausible to me that any computer (of the current type at least), no matter how complex and no matter what processes it was running, could ever become aware/conscious. Even if it appeared to fully act and think like a human from the outside.

Yet as far as it feels from my human standpoint, things like physical sensation and emotion and perception carry some intrinsic ""interpretation"". Pain feels ""bad"". It's not really up to me to decide that pain feels bad, it just does. Pictures in my memory are physically encoded in the brain by some neural configuration. But how are those encodings any more meaningful than the bits in the computer? Don't they need to be interpreted by something in a specific way by something before they have any meaning? If so, then what is doing the interpreting of the neural configurations to give them any kind of meaning?

The first response that comes to mind is, ""The brain is doing the interpreting of other parts of itself. Cutting yourself feels bad because pain receptors are triggered in the brain when you cut yourself."" But that doesn't get any closer to answering why those pain receptors lead to the subjective awareness interpreting pain to be something undesirable. It still seems like the pain receptors being triggered (literally just a combination of molecules moving/binding/unbinding and electrical impulses occurring, which again would appear to carry no intrinsic meaning) should be open to any interpretation, just like the bits in the computer are. Yet, in practice (from my subjective point of view), it's not. So why not?

How could any machine, no matter how complex, ever come up with its *own* interpretation of the data that it held? Clearly this actually happens with the human brain, so how does it?

Animals should have rights.

I will refute the justification of killing animals for food as my argument, because that is widely regarded as acceptable.

I believe many people feel that we are justified in killing animals for food in the same way that Savannah predators are justified in killing their prey. This is false. We, unlike Savannah predators, are now technologically advanced enough to build a system whereby we can acquire essential nutrients without the murdering of other sentient beings. If you are not satisfied with eating high-protein vegetarian food, we still have no excuse for not financing research of meat synthesis.

If one argues that we are justified in killing animals because they do not have the semblance of death that human beings possess, they are ignoring the fact that almost all animals still have a semblance of pain. The manner in which we confine and slaughter animals is surely recognized by the animals themselves.

Furthermore, to argue that a semblance of death, or a heightened intelligence, is the reason that we can kill animals I ask - why do we not simply kill off all the humans that do not have a semblance of death or a heightened intelligence, such as people in persistent vegetative states?

Society's real reason behind not killing humans, I believe, but having no problem killing other animals, is because even humans who are less intelligent than us are still 'our kind'. We rationalize our killing of animals and sparing of less 'useful' humans as 'humanitarian', when in actual fact, this is just glorified Speciesism.

Why have we made the rules? Why have we ordained ourselves to be above the rest, simply because we have the power to do so? If these are our actions, why do we vilify discrimination on a racial level?

How can we justify speciesism, but vilify racism?

We need to lower and then eliminate the extermination of sentient beings for food, and, obviously, for other purposes.

My curiosity piqued, I searched for ""men"".  The search returned 103 results.  My impression is that these are all the Denver/Boulder groups that have ""men"" in their title or anywhere in their description.  I browsed through them, and was . . . disappointed.  There were 

* several gay mens' groups (fine, but I'm not gay),
* a couple of Christian men's groups (not Christian either),
* a male chorale (sigh, can't sing)
* several groups that were clearly fronts for commercial organizations,
* a few that appeared to be male support groups but in fact are all run by the same woman who is also marketing her therapy services, 
* several ""pick-up artist"" or ""wingman"" groups (ick, no thanks)
* many more that just happened to have the word ""men"" in their description, but clearly were not intended to be men's groups.  In fact, some were specifically women's groups,
* finally, a couple that were genuinely men's supportive or ""male-positive"" groups.  In fact, one is run by an old friend.  It appears to have almost no activity.

I then did a search for ""women"".  The results were stunning.  449 groups.  Scrolling through them, I counted the number that were very clearly specifically for women only.  Of the first 100 I would say more than 90 were very explicitly for women only -- only a handful were ambiguous.  I gave up counting.

Women's book groups, power groups, support groups, hiking, sports, theater, business connections, knitting, investments, travel, women in transition, tea lovers, wealth and wisdom, wealth wisdom and wine, wellness wealth wisdom and winning (whew!), Christian, Black, therapy, aviation, outdoors, conservatives, toys, triathlons, bicyclists, networking, coders, musicians, personal growth, MBAs, adventure, on the edge, business startups, midlife warriors, singing, real estate, online entrepreneurs, Catholics, exercise buddies, coffee, thinkers, writing, lesbians (no, I'm not lesbian, either), golden girls, golf, skiing, books, girly books, lunch, goddesses, divas, grandmas, separation, singles (but women only), kettlebells, relationships, healthy sexy happy, mothers, happy hour, cooking, geeks, mind body and soul, lagers and ales, polycystic ovarian syndrome, motorcycles, fun, laughter and community, feminism, shopping, faith, brown, fit fun and over fifty, old bats, pregnancy, parties, hackers, and mountain bikers.  To name a few.

Holy cats!

Every single one of those was very clearly just for women.  I skipped over many redundant groups (how many women's business networking groups does Denver need?).  All of these are before one gets to the groups that mention ""men and women"" in their descriptions. I even counted Belly Dancing as either men or women.

What does this say about our society?  Are there really that many women who want an opportunity to get away from men?  Given how many redundant groups there were, was it a case of lots of women wanting a way to lead *something*?

Some examples:
* George Washington (US; 2 terms)
* Abraham Lincoln (US; 1 term)
* Woodrow Wilson (US; 2 terms)
* Franklin Roosevelt (US; 3 terms)
* William Pitt (GB)
* Winston Churchill (GB)

I'm going to focus on the United States from here down simply because I'm more aware of it, but I suspect that any other western country would have similar results. If you'd prefer you can skip to the bottom of the page and answer the question.

Here are the top ten presidents according to a [CSPAN](http://legacy.c-span.org/PresidentialSurvey/Overall-Ranking.aspx) poll of historians:
* Lincoln (Civil War)
* Washington (Revolutionary War)
* F. Roosevelt (WWII)
* Truman (WWII - Japan)
* Kennedy
* Jefferson
* Eisenhower (Korean War)
* Wilson (WWI)
* Reagan (Cold War - not true war)

Only four of those presidents are nonbellum: Truman, Kennedy. Jefferson. and Reagan.

The United States has been in a significant war for the following periods:
* 1776-1781 (0 terms)
* 1812-1814 (2 terms)
* 1846-1848 (1 term)
* 1898 (1 term)
* 1917-1921 (2 terms)
* 1941-1945 (2 terms)
* 1950-1953 (2 terms)
* 1964-1973 (4 terms)
* 1990-1991 (1 term)
* 2001-2012 (3 terms)

So: 6 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 10 + 2 + 12 = 51 years of war
and 2012 - 1776 = 236 years of existence
and 51 / 236 = 22% of the time the nation has been at war

Although the United States has been at war for 22% of its existence, six out of its top ten presidents served during a war.

It seems like the majority of great achievements mankind has made have been when the majority are suffering. Either due to war or under an oppressive leader. Where funds and efforts can be focused on a greater end then just the happiness of the everyday person. 

I'm not advocating a dictatorship or a war or anything but simply observing that when these things are happening, humans are more progressive then when living in a peaceful democratic world.

Peaceful times are nice for everyone but I feel like no one has a view for the future or a common goal. People just want a happy (maybe meaningless) existence. Things just become average and boring. People prefer efforts and money to go into making short term improvements for a quick return and cheap happiness (and again this is just an observation, im not against peace and democracy).

An example of all this is the last century with the 2 world wars and then the cold war. The competition between countries drove us to create new sciences, new technologies, explore space and may other things. People sacrificing happiness in their everyday life made it possible to do greater things.

It is often carried to the point of death by people as a last resort in life: they are often the dregs of society and hope that their extravagant protest will capture attention and inform the upper classes of the struggle.

There are also religious connotations associated with the freeing of the soul from the body, especially when it is the religion being oppressed that the protest concerns. Many mutilate only portions of their bodies and live on with the scars, but this is given less media attention, both currently and historically, possibly meaning that it is a less effective form of protest *IF* the goal of the protest is to bring attention.

Should self-destruction be viewed as a legitimate form of protest or given any political power?

Recitation - When you hear or read something, try repeating it out loud to yourself in your own words. This strengthens synaptic connections and gives you immediate feedback. Helping you learn things faster and more accurately.

Like most people I've always been told that a healthy press and an informed public are essential for a democratic society to function well, but when I look at the news today I notice there's a bit of a contradiction in the way things are being done now. 

As it happens now, in the US and most of the western world, most media outlets are run as for-profit organisations, which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing. But upon further examination, it seems to me that in prioritising profitability [which for many organisations is now about advertising reach and pageviews, which seems to be the case for major international corporations, local newspapers and bloggers alike], there is a built-in incentive for new agencies to ignore or under-report events which are Tremendously significant but complex or not terrible controversial *[such as illegal espionage, manipulation of foreign elections, Trade partnerships which may be harmful to countries involved, political corruption, and shoddy reporting of other organisations]* so that much more ""interesting"" and easily digestible topics can be published and quickly consumed by more people more frequently to maximise revenue *[such as the recent focus on Edward Snowden instead of NSA espionage, the week-long coverage of celebrity deaths on major news networks, the ongoing ""scandals"" about people like Paula Dean, or the pandering to public interest in cases like The Trayvon Martin trial, where news networks were flooded with guest after guest talking about their opinions on the case rather than providing an examination of the evidence of the case or reporting ongoing civil unrest in other nations, or the reality that most local news organisations seem to ignore or underreport the actions of the representatives of the locale they publish in]*. 

Over time it's also resulted in News organisations and broadcasting networks being consumed and consolidated by larger organisations in places like the USA, centralising the majority of mass media into a few organisations with very similar pressures and interests which can be manipulated from the top of the chain of ownership.  

Having subsidised Non-profit news organisations [Such as NPR] would seem like a good step toward removing a lot of these pressures that are harmful to Truthful and less biased journalism, but it could also introduce an incentive for organisations to avoid reporting subjects which would portray sponsors or governments in a negative light which may result in losing the funding necessary to continue putting out news. Furthermore this is only realistically viable at the larger scale, and would only further promote the consolidation of media into a few large organisations which could receive subsidy, incentivising the reduction of variety in media. 


I'm sincerely curious as to what steps you think would help improve the Quality and diversity of news organisations and the ability of journalists to report the truth and get it to the public who need the information to make educated decisions. Whether it be changes within organisations, New regulations or De-regulations or the amendment of existing laws in your countries, new ways of organising media or anything else. 

I'm quite concerned about the trend toward the Media outlets gravitating toward a flood of short, uninformative snippets of poorly sourced information, sensationalist gossip and opinions, but as a layman I really don't know what could be done to improve the situation.

Qualities we tend to pick up over time are those for which the penalty of not having them is death before reproduction. However the evolution of technology and innovation has changed things tremendously. People die for too many different reasons, and not necessarily before reproduction, to have any common gene be singled out easily and consistently. Additionally some things that we would have had to evolve to become resistant to, technology has evolved instead of us to combat it (ie. various vaccines).

My own guess is self-control. I can't speak for everywhere in the world, but in most developed countries there is an abundance of our basic needs (such as food, porn, entertainment through television and the internet, etc.) Many times it is very easy to over indulge in these and lose our motivation in the process, and even become addicted. This pits us in a battle between our limbic system and the rational, thinking layer around it. Our inner animal brain bombards us with urges and emotions while our rational brain tries to placate it. Our inner brain loves to just survive and so once you enter your comfort zone, it poisons you with fear to avoid change. Often our rational brain tries to argue with it but is unable to. As our society calls it, it takes tremendous willpower and motivation to change the ways of our inner brain.

Having this willpower makes people more happier and fulfilled in their lives, boosts confidence, makes them more attractive, and thus helps in their reproduction. Having such willpower prevents people from over eating and becoming obese, finding the energy to go to the gym and exercise and look more appealing, question their negative thoughts about their self-esteem and pick themselves up, avoid spending all their time on the internet and developing social anxiety. In that sense, I feel that our brains will continue to evolve so that our outside brain starts to become more powerful than the inner limbic one it is tied to. This will allow us to become more emotionally responsible. Although it is not fully ingrained in our biology, this is what meditation is essentially. Observing your emotions and thoughts, unattached.

If I were to delve deeper, I'm sure I could find some even darker, more ignorant, material bashing, slandering (libeling?), insulting, demeaning, and genuinely damaging the reputation of Barack Obama. Now, sure, throughout time there has been plenty of tomfoolery regarding political leaders, especially in the United States, that has satirized or held in contempt past presidents. 

Political humor is, obviously, nothing new but the modern era, freely granting access to the expressing and sharing of uncommon, untrue, or just unkind words to the masses, is ripe with excessive examples coupled with a fairly large audience. Furthermore, the enhanced concept of anonymity involved allows for those who desire to be overly mean can do so without fear of shame.

My question is how will the internet's famously unabashed mockery affect the way history remembers him, seeing as this is the first president to serve during such extreme Internet activities? If anyone can provide examples of such behavior under Bush's, or even Clinton's, reign, I'd be rather interested to see how political internet memes have evolved over the years.

Conversely, do you think that the Internet meme community will actually have a positive effect on the way President Barack Obama is remembered? In 100 years, will [this coincidence](http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/bl-obama-pictures.htm?x=272&amp;y=238&amp;PS=748%3A15) still get a laugh?

Another thought is that if people don't really have free will then they are destined to make the decisions they make and therefore we may be able to foresee these decisions and possibly even predict the future.

For those following the Eurozone crisis, you'll be up to speed. If not, here's a quick bio for the question:

At present several large economies within the Eurozone are riddled with so much debt that they're quickly approaching the point where they will have to default upon their loan repayments. If the countries default, it jeopardises the entire Euro as a currency, and as a region. 

Germany is basically the Eurozones banker. It's the only place investers are trusting their money right now. Germany maintains the only way out of the problem is for all the debt effected countries (basically everyone, not just Greece, Italy or Spain) need to change their monetary and fiscal policies to reduce their debt levels. 
________________

Now here is where my question comes in. In order for almost all Euro countries to curb their rising debt levels they NEED to introduce austerity measures to cut costs everywhere (and raise revenues). If you haven't been living under a rock then you've seen riots in almost every Euro country within the last week. Today alone 2 million people rioted within England. 

Basically, my question is: People are rioting because they feel tax increases and salary/pay rises being frozen is *unfair* to them. For a lot of people it will put them in a financially undesirable situation for several years. However, if countries throughout Europe DO NOT cut their debt levels then the entire Euro currency could crash. If the Euro crashed it would mean unprecedented levels of recession and depression. A poll conducted on Reuters not even a week ago (people polled were leading academics, industry heads/experts etc.) had over 50% of respondents indicating some form of Euro reshapping will occur. That's how sever it is. 

So, given the situation, should people be rioting and complaining about inconveniences right now, when in 12 months time there's a very real chance things could be magnitudes worse if debt levels spiral out of control?

Instead we are seeing mostly insurgencies and guerrilla war, especially in the wars of the USA. In this sort of warfare there might not be a clearly defined enemy, and war in its traditional sense will not happen at all. A sizable military force will mostly operate in peace keeping, or controlling an area while the enemy remains in the shadows or operating within the common populace.

Secondly: wouldn't allowing prices to go up help pay for the restoration of service and meeting of supply demands?

Eventually, once demand drops and supplies become more steady, the prices would then plummet to pre-storm norms (or maybe lower).

This can be true of generators and other supplies too.  Pre-storm, a genny may cost $1000... post-storm, when you have 30 people clamoring for it, then you can raise the price up, and up, and up!

The extremes in the debate are asinine: From outlawing all weapons/tools that could be used in violent assault; To allowing all weaponry and outsourcing all enforcement of the rule of law to individual citizens.

My take:

I think that this bias towards ""fairness"" in media does a LOT more harm than good. Its almost as if we never got rid of the fairness doctrine. To me, there are two problems with news media. One is a tendency to sensationalize. Rush Limbaugh et al are masters at this, but everyone does this. The major networks all do it, cable news does it, everyone does it. The other is the tendency to go overboard with presenting differing opinions. Its not time-efficient, and it gives us a confused picture at best and a complete misrepresentation of the facts at worst. If there's a story about an insane baby-killer, we don't need to discuss the pros and cons of killing babies. In fact, we shouldn't be discussing these types of things on national news anyway, since that's the realm of local news.

What we need is networks prepared to deliver meaningful, comprehensive analysis to help us synthesize information about current events. The eurozone, for instance, is very confusing if all you have is a nebulous array of facts and some talking heads saying what should or shouldn't be done. So, instead of asking random pundits what they think about issues, we should have news networks that are not afraid to explain the causes of current events and the bigger picture, biases and all. What we need is analysis not editorialization. The effect of this is two-fold. First, it may make news actually interesting without resorting to a ""we're-all-gonna-die"" level of hype. Secondly, it makes it harder for organizations like Fox to present ""both sides"" and claim to be fair and balanced based on that alone.

Basically, presenting both sides of an argument is confusing at best and promotes a distorted view of reality at worst. News networks should take their audience seriously, and rather than resort to ""two people talking so it must be fair"", we should have our reports explain a bigger picture, a theory to explain the facts and the causes of events, acknowledging bias in the explanation, but not shying away from it.

Anyway, what I would like to say is that my experience of growing up in Hungary was that either you are an intellectual or you are working class, which carries its own limitations. But we didn't have large numbers of non-intellectual college students. Back then I mean.

And especially for women, being working class teaches a huge amount of self-control, realism, loyalty, that sort of thing, when you spend your life being a waitress without much other hope of ever doing anything else you quickly realize that the love of a reliable beta guy and a nice home, and a stable, comfortable, loyal, loving family means more in life than cheating with some alpha dog or following ""chemistry"" and ""never settling"" and all that and partying every weekend and going for hookups etc. etc.

As for working class men it is not quite so, I know working class men with huge egos, but at least they don't get to be around the more vulnerable, classier women, so at least their attitudes cause less harm that way. I mean the Hungarian working class are frat-bros, but they are simply not going to be around vulnerable, classy women. The women they are  going to be around are masters of verbal castration or even the nut kick so there is not going to be much damage done.

Anyway, at some level, and especially for women I see something incredibly dangerous neither having the kind of a self-reflection and a deep understanding of life being a real intellectual means nor having the humility taught by blue collar labor, this ""college experience"" with ""easy degrees"" that do not force one to read hard books can easily lead to a self-adsorbed, narcissistic worldview?

Without universal environmental standards countries are free to have their own unique environmental laws, and thus corporations are able to ""shop around"" for the best place to do the types of business that destroy or harm the environment.

An additional source of income for teachers/staff that choose to participate, paying better than most other employment options. 
The hours between 3pm and 6pm are the most dangerous time for children. 
These hours are when they get invovled in gangs, drugs, and other negative things that lead to crime.
Daycare extending the hours of in public schools can address many goals at the same time. However, how it is done is important.

Examination of different Daycare Systems:

**Exclusive Daycare** &lt;&lt;&lt; the current daycare system

* Self adjusting in size/scale.
* Self supporting: Requires only the support of the parents use the program.
* If you do not like any of the fallowing: Cost, Location, Personnel, Other children, Other children's parents, Hours of Operation, Scheduled Activities, or anything else to do with the establishment. 
You can remove your child, and discontinue payment.

**Inclusive Daycare System**

Cons:

* You continue to pay if your child attends or not (because it includes everyone.)
* Loss of control of: Cost, Location, Personnel, Other children, Other children's Parents, Hours of Operation, Scheduled Activities, or anything else to do with the establishment. 

Political Cons:

* Expectations: The Inclusive system is burdened with expectations, which may be unrealistic. 
A system that includes everyone, carries the expectation of catering to specific wants/needs of everyone. 
Example: Transportation 

Exclusive Systems might offer these services, except carry the expectation that the payment for the specific service.

* Requires an act of (Local/State/Federal) government.
* Regulation: Every service which is financially subsidized will fall under (Local/State/Federal) regulation and political whims of said body(s.)
* Support: Every additional service which is financially subsidized will receive negative push back. This system divides people, and requiring popular support to keep the program alive.
Example: (I do not have children and therefore I object subsidizing the care of your child.)
* Improvement/Repair/Expansion: Any service which is publicly subsidized may require an act of (Local/State/Federal) government(s) for any additional Improvement/Repair/Expansion. 
Which may be slower than practical and negatively affect the program.

* Achievability: This system is unlikely to pass, or achieve the expectations of the people that use it. It has built in opposition and divides the community.

**The Hybrid, The Public Exclusive System **

The Public Exclusive system is already in existence, operated in many towns and cities, and only requires an act of the local Parent Teacher Association.

* Achievability: The Public Exclusive System is already operated in many towns and cities, and only requires an act of the local Administrators/Parent Teacher Association.
* Funding: Paid for by the parents whose children use the service.
* Subsidy: Does not require direct subsidy. Has built in subsides (Use of the school building/ teachers/staff have health insurance already.)
* Regulation: The local PTA/Administrators. (including payment method) 
* Support: Requires the support of the teachers/parents/staff that take part of the program. 

Even though it is Public, since it is Exclusive it carries most/all the benefits of an Exclusive system.

* Self adjusting in size/scale.
* Self supporting: Requires only the support of the parents use the program.
* If you do not like any of the fallowing: Cost, Location, Personnel, Other children, Other children's parents, Hours of Operation, Scheduled Activities, or anything else to do with the establishment. 
You can remove your child, and discontinue payment.

Each system has benefits and costs. Which ever system you choose costs you either directly or indirectly, even if you pick the current Daycare system, the Exclusive system.

This is a statement that demonstrates that because there is experience, experience is real. It does not prove or indicate the existence of an experiencer.

The functions of the foreskin in males is to…
a)    Keep the glans penis in its moist state, as the glans penis, or the “head”, is actually an internal organ like you stomach, kidneys and livers ect. (which is why in a lot of cases it’s pink or “shiny” in appearance)
b)   Provide skin to allow for comfortable erections, when the shaft is stretched at its most, by “gliding” backwards into the shaft.
c)    It is attached by the frenulum, which houses a great portion of “specialized” nerve endings for sexual pleasure.
d)   The foreskin, just like the frenulum, also has specialized nerve endings for “pleasure” as well.
e)    Foreskin lengths vary from male to male

Do you need proof? r/foreskin has great examples of this.
 
When you circumcise a male, a surgeon…
1. Doesn’t actually remove, or isn’t supposed to, remove all the foreskin from a males penis
2. the frenulum is generally removed.
3. For infant circumcision, it is impossible for a surgeon judge how much foreskin that same male will need in the future, as male penis foreskin length and use varies. (Some have foreskin that’s incredibly long, some males foreskin almost completely disappears into the shaft)

 
*Note: While these are universal truths, different men experience different amounts of sexual “pleasure” and it is impossible to quantify an emotion in itself, which is why I personally (opinion alert!) find it difficult to do research articles on it.
 
I want to talk about male circumcision and why that may be a symptom of a greater, national crisis; healthcare.
 
I personally, as an infant, was circumcised, though unlike the majority of the United States population; I had a complication due to the removal of too much foreskin. In a circumcision, according to my pediatrician, the surgeon isn’t supposed to remove the entire foreskin off the penis. This causes immediate problems in the age of puberty. I know this, because this is what I’m currently being forced to live through. 

I’m 16, and I've been experiencing chronic pain upon erection since the age of 12, (which was for me) the age of beginning of puberty.
 
As noted in #2, if my foreskin was there, I wouldn’t have this issue. Sadly, as a result of my surgery, I’ve been dealing with severe depression, partly driven from my “morals” (which, what is right and wrong is relative from person to person and culture to culture).

Most of my depression comes from the realization that I am be forced to live in excruciating pain on a daily basis. 

No apparent solutions were apparent with the exception of the “in-activist’s” “foreskin restoration”. (I quote because the result of this isn’t a true foreskin, and it still doesn’t compensate for the removal of the frenulum) Frankly, it’s truly depressing that it took me 6 urologists to come to any sort of solution. (I’m currently taking pain medication to help alleviate the pain that occurs upon erection) I can acutely say that I was told to “wait until I was having sex at 21” (I’ll leave that doctor anonymous) before I pursue a solution to “see, your penis is greater than 7in.!”.

So I understand that a lot of European males don’t get circumcised. This was brought by two (One is a Swede and one is a Brit,  both don’t have full citizenship) of my European friends when he commented on how strange the United States culture was around it. It left me curious, “why do US-Americans persist on doing this”. I did some hunting around and found out this. Even within the United States, male circumcision rates varied. Usually, states that didn’t have a subsidy in place for it had lower, closer to European rates of male circumcision. (Mainly on the west coast) Does that mean that male circumcision is high because it’s subsidized? Then I read this on a random, circumcision article on of all sites, Gawker.


""Pretty sure you can reap all the same health benefits of circumcision simply by washing your wang. I'd be curious to know what the hygiene habits were of the uncircumcised guys in the studies. Judging by the horror stories I hear sometimes from women about uncircumcised penii they've encountered, some guys are totally oblivious to the fact that you have to wash down there just like any other part of your body (and in order to wash effectively, you need to stretch it occasionally so you can pull it back and get in there)."" - Count_Zero_Interrupt


While there are definitely men who simply get serious infections due to malignant bacterial growth, this comment does speak to a bigger issue; hygiene, and preventative health. This isn’t surprising hearing all the news about people going to the emergency room because they simply couldn’t afford to get preventative health. Maybe there are so many circumcised males in US-America because there isn’t a dialogue about teaching preventive care among men. That issue is certainly present among sex in youth and dietary practices. 

“It doesn’t seem to that illogical”, I pondered to myself.

While a male can very easily, generally speaking, live his entire life without having his foreskin surgically amputated, the cultural issues in the United States surrounding education and health care make it so that this surgical intervention may be necessary. (especially among poorer individuals)

In my opinion, this could be solved with more education and healthcare solutions for both men and women, on how the human sexual organs function. 

So with the lack of education on basic bodily function on the male and female side in the United States, what do we need to do to help educate people on the functions of these sexual organs? Would it even help the very controversial circumcision debate?

Taking risks.  I've been thinking about it lately, and I'm having trouble at why it's so encouraged.

Of course I get that by risks, we mean taking smart, calculated risks, and backing it up by hard work, but it's still a risk.  If an industrious man decides to invest his money in a business, and works 90 hours a week on it, and all his skill is poured into making it a successful business.  There's still the significant chance of him failing for reasons outside his control.  Maybe he started a mortgage company right before the housing crash.  Maybe the location of his grocery store was just slightly out of view from someone coming down the main street.

The point is, if he succeeds, like a Steve Jobs, he will be a hero to most right leaning people.  He will be a name that will be repeated as an example of doing it right.  But let's say the man put in the exact same amount of work, but one tiny thing out of his control caused his business to fail.  Now he might have to sleep on his sister's couch.  He might have to go on welfare.  He might need a government subsidized loan to get back on his feet.  I think in this situation, he'd be vilified by the same people who would have praised him had he succeeded, even if in both cases, he put the same amount of work in.

Many people never actively consider their own morality and instead take moral stances that are essentially passed down to them. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but I would like you all to take a minute and consider what **you** consider as morality and **why** you believe that. 

Here's mine, as an example. 

Everyone is free to do anything that they desire, unless it infringes upon another person's freedom to do as they desire. 

My morality is based on the idea that freedom to act is universally desired. It remains simple and vague to accommodate the wide possibility of desires that a person my have, and what they might consider to be good, right, or moral, known as moral relativism. It also avoids, in the situations I've considered, the problems of assigning worth to a person or assigning purpose to their actions or desires.

It contains tens of billions of neurons. Each neuron has the entire human genome in it, and each neuron is connected in such density to other neurons that the amount of connections reach into the hundreds of trillions. 

Somehow this is YOU. You are your brain. But as a matter of subjective experience, it certainly doesn't *feel* like we have a brain. Indeed, the vast majority of what is happening in our brain is unknowable to us. We are conscious of only a very small part of what our brain is doing. We just accept what it serves up to our conscious awareness. 

An example of this is language. When someone begins talking to me, I understand what they are saying almost *effortlessly*. But it’s not like I consciously took in each noise, interpreted it as a metaphor for the idea it represents, and assembled it in relation to all of the other words to form an English sentence. *I* *just* *understand* *it*. It’s like the brain is a black box. It receives signals from sensory information, manages them in a process that is subjectively unknowable, and nicely serves something up to conscious awareness.     

As humans, we have reached a level of understanding that is unparalleled by any other species on this planet. We've learned how to perform marvelously complex tasks. Obviously, the complexity our brains is a blessing, but I think it may also carry a burden. 

Being as complex as it is, what problems (if any) arise out the fact that as a matter of subjective experience, our brains remain mostly invisible?

I'm using ""authenticity"" here because I would say that ""authenticity"" is a value that many hold in a high regard, and I can't think of anything that might trump it.

I refrain from using ""family"" or ""friends"" here because there should be something more specific being valued. I would say, at least today, that ""authenticity"" sets the tone for marketing to the current generation, as opposed to earlier generations where values such as loyalty, honesty, or education might prevail. We see ""authenticity"" on television, in politics, public figures, our friends, etc, all of whom want, or might want, to project an image of being the ""real deal"".   

Now, an adverse affect of being ""authentic"", or even projecting an image of being ""authentic"", might be that it gets used as a means for not owning up to personal responsibilities. (Insert possible example). It also opens up an individual, or groups, for criticism. I'll cite the Dixie Chicks here (sorry) as an example. At a concert lead singer said, ""we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States [George W. Bush] is from Texas."" There was, of course, a backlash from the media and public. Why? You want ""authenticity"" and then when you get it you bring out the pitchforks.  

tl/dr: What can be valued more than authenticity, and what are the potential negatives associated with it?

Discussed it with my GF, who was previously a waiter, she said: stress is also when you have to work hard and fast because you have suddenly many guests. And I said: but it is stressful because you have to move your hands and legs quickly, or because you are worried that you cannot get it right, guests will complain, bosses will criticize and generally you are uncertain about the outcome? She said OK it is the later, moving hands or legs quickly is not stressful, it is the uncertainty of the outcome that is stressful.

Similarly, in my inhouse ERP consulting job, I am stressful not because I am working hard or fast, but because I am uncertain and worried, and I am sometimes working hard or fast because I am uncertain and worried, but that in and of itself is not stressful. 

Basically, if a boss tells you, just to use a primitive example, that you have to lay 100 bricks in 1 hours, it is not stressful because of the bodily movements required to do so but because you are not sure you can do it.

If this theory is correct, stress would have an easy enough solution: bosses must make very, very clear what they expect and what the consequences are: they should say very openly if you lay under 20 bricks you are fired, between 20 and 50 you are not fired in the short term but I will grumble and you might be fired later on, between 50 and 100 I will grumble, but there is no danger of the sack, between 100 and 120 I will say nothing, 120-150 you get praised, over 150 you will get tangible rewards.

I'm hoping that the problems in the following attempt at deduction can be located. I willingly put in fallacious assumptions, but here the aim is not the truth, but an attempt to give an account for the unspoken justifications that govern our way of living.

There exist two links in the above question, (i)the first is a conditional statement: if the world is viewed as an object, then there exists an unspoken assumption that all ideas are equal; (ii) is also a conditional statement: if there exists an unspoken assumption that all ideas are equal, then democracy is an system of organization that ""makes sense"", even though we may not be fully able to articulate why. 

Elaboration:
(i)Suppose that we perceive the world as object, then there must exist a subject that perceives. All that is object is ""other"" than the subject, hence another ""subject"" qualifies as an ""other"". All ""other""s are determined by the laws of cause and effect. All objects act and react. Ideas are a form of action and reaction, and ideas are considered to be ""other"" than the subject, hence ideas are object, and hence ideas are determined by the laws of cause and effect. The subject is a gracious exception to these laws. All objects are equally susceptible to the laws of cause and effect. Hence all ideas, which are a subset of all objects, are equally susceptible to the laws of cause and effect. Hence, all ideas are equal. 

(ii)Suppose all ideas are equal. Hence, all collections of ideas are equal and all systematized sets of ideas are equal, by nature, and thus, all men, individuals which possess a set of ideas, are equal. Sets of ideas are made superior to the other by means of debate and agreement (convention, norms, laws, mores). Since all men are equal, that men are ruled by a natural hierarchy is at best a myth; democracy is the only true, sensible form of organization.

So granted, The Bank Of England already exists, but it has been made independent- ostensibly on understandable grounds of efficiency, and it's a very different beast to HBOS.

Why aren't the left talking about state sector banking, where talented individuals disillusioned with city life go to allocate funds for profit (I imagine it would look to remain profit making), but also to the benefit of society, based on democratically determined ethics? Why aren't they talking about a mandatory investment quota for green energy? For daycare centres? For transport? For educational resources?

The big problem of capitalist economics is that supply does not follow per-capita demand, rather per-pound demand. Ensuring against profit-loss would stop this from skewing economics to the point of communism- but would bring the supply as close to per-capita demand as capitalism will allow.

The point is that while full control of bank funds by the state might (for some vague, Hayekian reason) be intractible, but it would take strong empirical evidence (greater than the visceral reactions by libertarians to impurities in The Market) to say that it is not flexible under partial control, under state guidance.

The trouble with exponential growth is that it can sound less important than it is. For instance, in encryption, a 128-bit key isn't just two times better than a 64-bit key. It's about 1.85*10^19 better. This is often [exploited by snake oil peddlers](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/the_doghouse_cr.html) to make several thousand bit keys sound useful.

Further, a 256-bit key isn't just twice as good as a 128-bit key. If you read the math in the link above, you'll see that due to fundamental thermodynamic limits of computation, a 256-bit key cannot be brute forced even with the entire energy output of a supernova. But if you see notations like 2^128 or 2^256, it's not obvious just how big a difference that is.

It's a problem for other notations, as well. In Neal Stephenson's ""Zodiac"", the main character is a guerrilla environmentalist with a chemistry background. When measuring pH levels of contaminated soil, he got in the habit of telling people that the results showed it was ""more than double"" the EPA's limit. Which was technically correct, but in fact, pH is a logarithmic scale, and the company involved was actually several thousand times the limit. Problem is, people just have their eyes glaze over when they hear numbers like that, and ""more than double"" has a better impact.

So, is there a way to change the notation such that the psychological impact is more in line with technical precision?",,False,,t5_2smsq,False,,,True,t3_ixsgg,http://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/ixsgg/can_the_notation_for_exponents_be_modified_to/,

In the UK (as in the US), there is no doubt his jailers would simply have locked him up and thrown away the key. Anything short of this would have produced a public outcry. 

[I read an interesting philosophical argument recently that hints at why this might be so](http://tomkow.typepad.com/tomkowcom/2012/07/a-few-short-steps-to-the-gallows.html), arguing that one way of viewing justice is as exacting retaliation **on behalf of the victim**.

The latter part is in bold because I believe it is key to the whole argument. This being the case, perhaps it would be easier to see justice as being done, allowing potentially for more lenient rehabilitative sentences within the confines of seeming justice, if peoples wishes for the extent of their posthumous retaliation were given earlier- if, perhaps, people were to put their wishes (perhaps conditional on certain factors) for the punishments of their killers in their wills. 

It is already possible for the living to chose the extent to which they press charges- why not the dead?

I read (or hear) that every one is entitled to one, but I am dubious about their general usefulness.

I'll try to lay this out. I'll admit this is a first try of getting all this down in a coherent form. 

On a social network yesterday, I read an argument between two people about whether a particular college program's recent actions were justified. One agreed. One disagreed. In the end, neither person came to understand the other's opinions and they ended with ""agree to disagree.""

That's one example.

Here's another: ""I think [my political enemy] is a [terrible person] and anyone who likes him needs to leave [my country.]""

It seems to me two me that opinions are anchored by two things:

1. Many of them are designed to ""circle the wagons."" In other words, folks use opinions as shields, to draw a line in a debate and then put someone on the other side. This seems simply ... mean. 

2. Many opinions are largely unprovable. You see this a lot in politics where someone will offer a number (hard, clinical) about something only to have someone else refute the opinion with a different number arrived by different, but just as clinical means. A more specific example relevant to the argument I witnessed yesterday was someone stating something was in a ""contract"" and that ""he had seen it."" But how does the other party really _know_ that the first party actually saw the contract he's referring to? Meanwhile they're both getting upset with one another.

Is any of this useful? I don't think there's a _better_ way of doing things; don't get me wrong. I think that I am bothered by the tunnel-vision often accompanying opinions. It all makes me wonder: Are opinions really that useful? Why? Why not?

CISPA, deepweb and the possible connections between the Boston Marathon bombing.

What if they found out how to make the bombs by using proxys and going into deep web where Child pornography is found, using those sites to get the materials and plans they needed. Now if this was explained to the public the majority would support trying to remove the deep web right? Because its dangerous and has Child pornography, that alone would probably garner huge amounts of support from the general public.

But what happens when they find out the information from this kid? Are they going to tell us? how do we even know if what they're telling us is the truth.

Before you think conspiracy, I don't really care. I don't follow conspiracies nor do I care if they are actually true, and I have read the big ones like 9/11 and NWO.

But one more thing I remember thinking about was along the lines of what if they let him do a public speech? to apologize? to explain himself? This has been such a huge event where everyone around the world was following, couldn't this be something the world voted on? A webpage created by the government dedicated to allowing us to pitch our names and to vote out of options like; 

* Death penalty
* Lifetime in Jail no exceptions
* 100 Years in prison with the ability to be let out earlier depending on actions.
* Sent to a Mental institute for 5 years where he is studied and then sent to prison for 25 years. 

Those were just examples and I just want to explain the 100 years in prison quickly, because as a 19 year old having 100 years in prison might seem a hugely long time but think of the technology advancements by that time, it would be an entirely new world with the possibility of new medicines and longer lasting age, he may possible be able to see that unfold from within prison.

So I guess the real question I'm trying to ask here is, how will this change things? Will this new event unfold into even bigger things, will people use this to their advantage or will this just be a one time event and nothing follows?

Whats going to happen next?

To sum up quickly, I provoked a discussion about love and sex across 4 subreddits with more than 1k combined comments and 10k up/downvotes.  I will recap: female redditor pntbttrkelly asked men in r/sex to describe what penetrative sex felt like.  I swanned into the discussion that night, fired off a reply attempting to elaborate on the purely emotional aspect, and then went to bed.  I figured somebody might find it interesting.

That turned out to be something of an understatement.  Without qualification, this has been the most interesting discussion I've ever been involved in on the internet.  (You can read more **[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/14fyke/weve_heard_from_the_women_of_sexxitnow_its_the/), or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14hg05/kano321_provides_a_perfect_description_of_what/), or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/14hwfb/a_guy_in_rsex_posts_one_of_the_most_creepy_clingy/), or [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/14hyy8/on_penetrative_hetero_sex_theres_undeniably_a/))**

-------------------------------------------------

Opinion varied wildly, names were called, feelings were hurt, consensus was not reached, hugs were not had afterwards.  Yet less than .01% of those questioned WHY this reaction caused so much drama.  Even the most willfully obtuse of critics recognize that these feelings are genuine; things like loneliness, love, and reciprocity resonate deeply inside whatever weird thing it is that makes us human.  Teenagers studying Shakespeare might argue over whether Romeo and Juliet made good choices or exercised self-control -- ""Romeo acted like a girl, Juliet is soooooo stupid"" -- but the characters remain 100% credible.  Adults tend to recognize that they were simply young and we failed to support them.  (And incidentally that is the core of the tragedy.)

Some struggled with metaphor; of course life is not cold cruel and merciless all of the time.  But we needed to establish a contrast.  And the reason is because that feeling of attachment during sex is close to unimaginably intense at times: it has a tendency to defy description.

For the bro argument, ""OP must get no play"": it was wrong, I'm not sure if it's worth unpacking.  Next.

Fourth point, for those who got hung up on the language (mostly /SRS types): I think they missed I was trying to highlight something more important than the word ""conquest"" and the physical or social power aspects of sex.  Their loss unfortunately.

-------------------------------------------------

**Most importantly from my perspective : Keen readers will notice I didn't actually pass judgement on that feeling; I don't know if it's good, I don't know if it's healthy, I don't know if it's moral.  I just know that it exists. It can give your life incredible meaning or rip you to shreds, and has done both to me in the past.**

**That's why Romeo and Juliet has persisted as arguably the most famous love story ever written -- the frustratingly stupid, needlessly tragic end is as valid as any sweet emotion in their bedroom.  Living with that is just one of the core truths of being human for a lot of us.  And that's EXACTLY why everyone struggled so hard afterwards to define what we were getting at so passionately.**

So:
 I would assume, that there is no probability of 0 and no probability of 1, which means even the most unlikely event imagineble will still inevitably happen somewhere sometime, and that even the most certain thing in the world still has a chance of not happening sometime.

So with these facts given, in real life, you could basically never base a decision on probability, because you could still at any time be *that guy* that hits the 0.0000001%.

I do admit there are interesting people on the Left - orthodox  Marxists and the kind of anarchists (libertarian socialists) who challenge the whole concept of permanent homsteading. They have interesting ideas to think about. So to speak the ""hard left"" can be interesting. 

But the average left-liberal, progressive, feminist, cultural relativist, tolerant, whatever intellectualism I ultimately find boring, because it all boils down to egalitarianism:

- non-judgementalism, which is ultimately not using your brain

- in other words you may find differences between people and cultures but you must not find the important enough to actually make up your mind and form a judgement

- egalitarianism boils down to subjective hedonism: if there are important purposes to live for, not everybody is equally suitable for these purposes. But if we just live for ""having fun"", one person's fun worths as much as the others.

- I am just tired of taboos, frageverbots and  crimethink that liberal intellectual culture is shot through, it is not open-minded at all but basically ""prejudiced against bigotry"" for example you are not allowed to find anything wrong ever every with homosexuality or gay subcultures no matter how good your argument or how perceptive your observation is - it is simply a taboo, and it is almost like a religious taboo, You Must Not Touch The Sacred Cows

- an overly reliance on feelings, esp. empathy, i.e. ""basic human decency"", as if there were not many otehr virtues often more important than ""being nice with others"", for example: pride in one's work,

- a reflexively materialist, scientistic, empiricist, not only atheist but completely vulgar-materialist worldview, without even offering any decent criticism of competing idealist thought i.e. the ""truth as coherence"" as the alternative worldview, just basically accepting it all uncritically, because equating knowledge with scientific knowledge,

- a dumb approach to history: every time anyone was not treated fully equally and/or not allowed to live out his/her subjective preferences he/she is ""oppressed""

- and of course ""oppression"" cannot ever be caused by anything else than the gain of the oppressor group  - or dumb superstitious bigotry

- in other words every social situation is explained either as an primitive oppressor-oppressed dynamics, The Man keeping ya down, or a vague lack of ""enlightenment""

- worst part? talking about ""critical thinking"" and suchlike (basically code words for being smart) and then explaining the world in the simplest oppressor-oppressed dynamics! Pretending to see through some kind of veil, but whatever reality they  see through that veil is as simplistic as a comics book for 10 years old boys, Bad Boss oppressing e'rrybody. Every time in Reddit thread someone blamed corporations like McD for obesity, the problem is not even whether it is right, but the problem is that it is presented as some ""critical thinking"" idea even when it is simplistic as hell,  and it is presented as something counter-cultural, brave and iconoclastic even though when literally millions of college-ed people believe in stuff like this! Show me five people with a degree in humanities and I will show you at least two who thinks like this - it is as mainstream as possible! At least in intellectual circles.


**My point is not even that it is wrong, but it is boring and intellectually unstimulating.** It is the worldview of a semi-literate high school student - and I have no idea how  this worldview recruits **professors**?

One possible explanation is that simply because conservatism is even dumber. Well, mainstream American Neocon Republicanism _is_ perhaps even dumber, but are you sure for example the articles like (link to two AmConMag articles removed) do not present a really higher intellectual niveau? 

Any way I see it, todays true intellectuals are the Paleocons.

(OK there is one left-liberal online publication I found somewhat interesting: Crooked Timber)

Perhaps some will say I am really scraping at the bottom of the left-liberal barrel, really pointing out the worst specimens. Erecting ~~strawmen~~ strawpeople, too. Maybe, but my point is that I was not able to find better left-liberalism even though it is supposedly the standard intellectual worldview and I spend hellofa lot of time online! Usually more intellectual left-liberal publications basically just put forth the same ideas in a more obscure language - ""addressing the social causes of crime"" for example is a more obscure way of putting ""the poor steal because The Man keeps them down"" - it is not intellectual at all.

I am not American. This matters, because the American education system keeps future Harvard students and future woodworkers in the same high school classes, therefore they always relate to each other somehow, and I figure many American thinks an intellectual opinion is something one level higher than that of the average woodworker. I am a product of a more elitist system and for me an intellectual opinion is something one level higher that of the average community college professor - any idea that does not make highbrows go jaws dropped hardly worths the time considering. And on this test, most of left-liberalism I find intellectually boring and unstimulating, shallow and simplistic.

So why does it attract intellectuals again? Can anyone explain it?

Sorry if it is too much like a rant or too polemical. I am frustrated - not because my side is losing history, screw that. I am frustrated because I crave intellectual stimulation, I am addicted to it, to the thrill of thinking, and most left-liberal stuff online (which means most stuff online) simply bores me to death.

than what I see everything the fingers move like a river across the surface of the phone. The thoughts are becoming more 
structured now. But still not. I really understand. A inner depth and warmth, inside everything. It's obvious that the world. 
Proclaiming everything that I feel inside me. No one understands this. But still everyone can understand it. I should make a 
song about this. No a whole album or many. Now it feels like I'm gaining a deeper understanding for everything. How 
everything is connected. Everything is just as it should have been forever. It feels. LET ME HAVE THIS MOMENT. I wanted to 
say that, and type, all the feeling and how everything should be. And I am one with everything, and I am stuck in time but 
still not. Is Måns reading this? How cool it would be if he's reading what I'm writing while I'm writing it. In such a primal way 
that I feel and see everything. As if the whole myself is doing this because I. I shouldn't speak.

 
 
 
Writing down the words to this. I'm thinking about how cool it would be if my words were put to music. About how 
people will listen and perceive this afterwards. That I'm sending messages into the future. I'm being sent deeper into my own 
life. Now I'm writing this and I'm think that I'm going to show it to Max after I have. Make up a word. A word that describes 
everything. Reality. But even deeper. Many words and thoughts that guide me on my way towards the right word. How crazy 
is it that I'm writing this? That I'm breaking the fourth wall all the time. I am completely gone from what I previously wrote, 
but I'm still completely on track. Everything is connected in this conversation with myself and with reality. I'm feeling 
maniacal. Have to get all of this out, why haven't I written before? Want to show everybody, but still not. Open the 
innermost chest to everything. FG wants me to show him. that I shouldn't because I can't describe everything. But I'm going 
to describe everything anyway. Everything how everything is one together. It feels like if I understand everything on a 
deeper level. Can't stop describing everything.

 
 
 
Why is the language like it is? What is the point of it anyway? If I just can keep describing this. A neverending river of 
thoughts that never stops. Soon we must go away from here. Read while I'm typing. Now FG is standing here. I feel how his 
whole spirit is flowing across me but still not. As if I understand the whole. And that I understand that we humans don't 
undertand. Being thrown deeper into the everything. Reality is crazy. Crazily correct. Everything is as it should be. Who is 
going to read this later? Feeling the smoke from Max' cigarette next to me. Should post this on the internet. Share with as 
many as I can. Becoming scared. That I'm scared that I'll never get out of this. Realizing how Max is reading this and that 
I'm writing messages about myself to Max that he may never even read anyway. Disonnected the thoughts that flow around. 
I can't be bothered to sit here with my phone. But still I write. Like a primal sea inside me that has to get out I have to 
continue typing. Am I mad? Maybe. Does it matter? How will I understand anything ever again. When I get impulses to do 
things I can feel the sea flowing outwards again. But I have a force inside of me that is atleast as

It occurs to me that a lot of redditors hate r/SRS. Really *really* ***really*** hate r/SRS. But, at its core, [[/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays) stands for a lot of good things. I particularly like the fempire because it's a subreddit dedicated to equality, where all forms of inequality are given equal weight (racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, sexism...well, misogyny, any way). [/r/SRSDiscussion](/r/SRSDiscussion) is also a great subreddit to talk about these things.

However, the fempire has evolved (or has always been?) more than a group of subreddits that are against discrimination of all kinds, and there are a lot of posts outside of the fempire laying out why [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays) fails because of those reasons. Now, I don't want this to be a thread about how everyone in [[/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays) sucks and how they should be done away with, but I think it's worth considering what an alternative to the fempire would be like, especially because, I feel that it's easy to label those who are against the fempire as misogynist/racist/homophobic/transphobic.

Can we have a subreddit that promotes equality, and gives equal weight to all forms of discrimination, that doesn't have the problematic aspects of [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays)? What would such a subreddit be like?

I have a few ideas to start us off:

1. **A subreddit that hates sexism/racism/homophobia/transphobia/ableism/etc., but doesn't hate Reddit.** Yeah, reddit doesn't do a good job of not being the above, but we are all redditors, and a lot of us have good reason to defend this place with homogenizing it as a bunch of awful people.

2. **Not having tolerance for prejudice against privileged groups, as well as not having tolerance for prejudice against marginalized groups.** I totally understand the circlejerk behind [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays), and I buy into the idea that a really good way to teach privileged people what it's like to be marginalized is to turn the tables. However, I also believe that that kind of behavior has a time and place, and while [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays) might be a good place for it, I feel places for serious discussion would not be. I particularly don't like this idea because it reminds me of how brutal internet atheists can be: yes, atheists are persecuted IRL much more than they are on the internet, but to say that religious people aren't discriminated against in a subreddit like [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) is...disingenous at best.

3. **It should be centered around education.** A lot of people who fight against this stuff every day of their lives can get exhausted, and can quickly become enveloped in rage toward people who may (or may not) be innocently ignorant on the most basic of ideas, or who may be trying to civilly debate an ""awful"" idea. I agree that a person has every right to be upset at someone else's ignorance or intolerance, but I believe that, if our goal is to educate people on how to be less racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/abelist/etc., then we should try our best to keep that rage in check. No, going into a senseless rage over intolerance is not even nearly as much of a sin has being intolerant yourself, but I think it's something we should keep in check, no?

4. **I think we should at least try to affiliate/be friendly with the fempire.** Yes, this entire idea is based off of the ""failings"" of the fempire, but our core ideas and values should be the same, and I think it would be best if we all recognized that, and thought of each other as respectful alternatives. I know that if this subreddit takes off, I will still be posting in many fempire subs, but here as well. :)

Intelligence would be another characteristic, which ties in a little with wisdom as well. Knowing and understanding facts is one thing, living a happy life and making others around you happy as well is another. Both to me are intelligent, yet on different terms. 

Self-awareness another characteristic. Being aware of ones strengths/weaknesses, being aware when one is wrong, being aware of truths/falsehoods. Being aware of what's going on in the world too, a certain global understanding and awareness. 

Moderation is one to highlight. I don't think a truly selfless person is ideal, nor a truly selfish. This works for many behaviours; passive vs active, impulsive vs reflective, introvert vs extrovert. Extremes don't seem to reflect and ideal human to me.

I see myself as an arbitrary label placed upon an mathematical engine that is my ""consciousness."" In this simulation of logical reality, that consciousness is computed using an electrochemical machine known as the brain. This machine is a collection of matter and energy, but my consciousness is not. It is abstract, it does not exist in the simulation but rather is a mathematical construct. It has no definite boundaries.  I am software, not hardware.

We are a way for the universe to experience itself. And subjectivity - how do we draw our boundaries? We arbitrarily assume compartmentalization into individuals just because that's how we rationalize it. But that's just it - it's fairly arbitrary. Experience is just a mathematical abstract - inaccessible outside of the origin. As far as subjectivity is concerned, there is no difference between a simulation and ""reality"" - whatever that is. So if we clone an experience - does that make two separate ones, or is it the same? If we append two experiences, does that make it distinct from the individual parts?

In that sense, we cannot definitively separate different points of experiencing the world. So while we are temporarily confined to a pool of experiential data by our memory, once we ""die"" or cease to maintain that separation, there is no difference between any of those individuals. If you can comprehend what I mean - it's that while we are all individuals, we are also the same being, that is able to meet, experience, and interact with itself. Literally. So you could call that an ""afterlife"", but also a ""beforelife"", or just a ""simultaneouslife.""
Sorry if that's a little hard to understand, but this is a difficult concept to convey.

Let me try to use an example. You are born in 1903. You die in 1955. You then are born in 1200 BCE, and die in 1212 BCE. You are then born in 1463, and die two hours later due to complications at birth. You are then born in 1953. You happen to be born in the same hospital as your 1903-born self is dying of cancer in. Your old self briefly makes eye contact with your young self being carried out by your mother. In fact, eventually you will live the life of your mother, and your father, and that one guy who happened to be working in the convenience store when you took that road trip to Kentucky, and the policeman who you shot and killed when you were living the life of a young man in Baltimore, and your wife from that one life in 12th century France. You have lived every life there ever was, because there is nothing separating you and me and everyone else once we cease to be an individual. Ergo, before we are born, and after we die.

If you really want to take your brain for a spin, start applying this concept to a simulation.  Load the consciousness into a program.  What happens when you change the code?  Clone the program, run multiple instances?  Stop and restart.  Does time matter?  Make a copy, delete the original.  Load the program into a new kind of machine, same input and output, but different code.  Is it the same program?

I know Reddit holds a firm opinion on this type of issue, and as most of you realize, anti-piracy legislation often brings with it ""side-effects"", like internet censorship and the narrowing of freedoms. These ""side-effects"" are usually identified as the downfall of anti-piracy measures, as those who are informed alert their fellow citizens and lawmakers that they are creating more *bad* than *good* (i.e, ACTA/SOPA/PIPA).

Also, it's a popular belief here on reddit to tag digital piracy as a service issue rather than a legal one. The argument is that if it's ""faster and cheaper"" to pirate content, people will continue to do it, regardless of what the law dictates. This sentiment is exemplified by services like Spotify/Pandora/Netflix/Steam that allow consumers to access content even easier than piracy, and are cited as revolutionary ways to combat copyright theft.

I'm just stuck in a rut because I have a job with few prospects outside of my desired industry and I also have outsized ambitions.  I want to move to San Francisco and start my real career instead of just working to pay the light bills.  Unfortunately, I'm a lawyer by desired trade, and it's difficult to make the case to potential employers when there's a resume gap -- so that kind of defeats the case for picking up shop and heading out there without a job.  

Sure, there are factors working against me, particularly the economy and a shrinking industry, but I have a sneaking suspicion that I can put off a better aura to everyone I connect with, which would serve me well in interviews and in networking.  There's an emotional toll to having worked so hard to get oneself over the big obstacles, only to have small social obstacles standing before the finish line.  That makes it hard for me to feel super positive and optimistic, especially when my core talents include being analytical and skeptical, talents which lead me to poke holes through the narratives that people tell themselves and one another to stay resilient and persevere through adversity.  

So this is somewhat personal philosophy, and somewhat motivational, and then also pragmatic, but my question is this: what general principles have helped you put out positive energy -- and how do you gauge something so abstract as the energy you put out, something which people don't normally have the vocabulary or metaphors to discuss in a productive fashion?

The question comes from the context of India and their caste system. There people are born into arbitrary subsets of the population that through time and generations have been taught to believe some are superior and some are inferior. The inferior ones are exploited by the superior ones. The question is: In what direction should legislation go on the matter of preventing this? How much should authorities intervene? (If at all) After all, one could argue that the ones believing they are inferior are doing so ""on their own free will"".

Now generalize this. How much should society intervene with one's personal decisions when these decisions are harming oneself for the benefit of others? On the one hand there's the above argument. On the other hand in some extreme situations (like the caste system, they are doing it on their own free will) it is clear that some people are being exploited.

I would argue that a similar situation in which society has already decided in favor of intervening protecting the ones being exploited is the work market. In a situation where there's a wealthy group and a very poor group, the very poor will be desperate for work. This allows the wealthy group to pay arbitrarily low. Our society has decided in favor of intervening: if you're poor, even if you make a _willing_ decision to work for very low wages, you can't. You're forbidden. You're not allowed to make such a contract with another person. The argument is that this helps get people out of situations where they can't defend themselves and thus be exploited.

What other situations of this kind can we find? In the case of castes, the oppression mechanism is indoctrination. People born in a low caste are raised by parents themselves in a low caste and taught from day one that they are inferior. They willingly proclaim themselves they are inferior and want to dedicate their lives to living in shit for the superior caste. This is an oppression mechanism as strong if nor stronger than financial dependence.

I think in these two cases are very clear that one group is exploiting the other. In the first case, western societies decided to defend the group being exploited. In the second case, India government seems (I don't know too much about the subject) to allow the practice of caste indoctrination.

What about the oppression mechanism of lack of education? Imagine two people one of them has a certain high education and the other one has poor education. Imagine someone wants to get away with making a deal that benefits him and not the other person (because that other person would be better off making a better deal with someone else). That person could probably get away with making said deal with the uneducated person but not with the educated person. However, this situation is routinely allowed in our society. I'm not saying it shouldn't be, I'm just wondering to what point is one's fault of not educating himself. Maybe he's just lazy and then he deserves being exploited in this manner? Or maybe he didn't have access to higher education, forever damaging his learning flexibility as an adult and making it impossible to defend himself against this kind of exploitation.

What other similar situations do we see or could hypothetically see?

Who wins? I've pondered on this question for ages now and I have never come to a successful answer. One single Israeli F-15 could destroy entire German squadrons without breaking a sweat and one single Merkava could roll around the battlefield without getting a scratch.

 Anyway I thought the movie was pretty interesting, though I found a few inconsistencies. For one, the discussion that Gamble has on crop circles is entirely based upon his conclusion that they MUST be alien made because humans couldn't do something that pretty. I find that hardly scientific, and in fact humans not only can, but have businesses making crop circles for people, whether it for attention or as a prank. Two, the information about Nikola Tesla that he presents is false, and Tesla had nothing to do with ""free"" energy, and was shut down due to competition with Thomas Edison. Three, Nine of the scientists associated with the film (including Chopra) have publicly announced their dissociation with the film upon its release. Four, the flower of life was ""burnt into the atomic structure of the-"" what the fuck? I don't even need to get into that (sources also state that it was painted/carved into the rock). Five, some of the footage of UFOs is footage (such as the mexican one) that was proven to be a hoax. Six, David Ick, a speaker on the film, has some crazy relationship with lizardmen that I would rather not get into. Also, all the footage used was stock, none of it was collected by the man himself, minus a few in house interviews. Do I have to point out all of the examples he uses to show that humans are making progress are news paper headlines, which Gamble said were controlled by ""the Rockefellers,"" so how is that credible evidence? This ""film"" is, to put it bluntly, utter bullshit. I stand by my original assertion, though I won't call it a ""conspiracy theory"" for the sake of argument. It does cover some real events in our lives, but by pushing the ""Them"" against ""Us"" attitude, it solves nothing. Slactivism (which is all he really advises us to do at the end of the hour and twenty eight minute ""scare"" segment) is a common issue that plagues Americans today. It, once again, solves nothing. Gamble presents us with some very real issues, but hides it in a fog inconstant facts, junk science, cherry picking, and the lack of understanding that ""correlation doesn't equal causation"". If you'd like to take to movie at face value, go ahead, but do so knowing you are acting the same way followers of religion do, a blind you-have-all-the-answers approach. I don't expect this to go away, I just hope people will realize it for what it is and not sit on their butts waiting for ""the rockefellers and jp morgans"" to fall.

Personally while its message of unity and love is *good,* the fact that the movie has information that is proven wrong I feel makes it *negative*, as its using the themes of goodness to excuse its inaccuracy.

The upgrade from no airconditioning to airconditioning makes you think you'd like a climate controlled system within your car, etc. etc.
