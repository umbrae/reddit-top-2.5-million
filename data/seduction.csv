Try this line.",2008,499,306,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1f9f8e/hitting_it_off_with_a_girl_feeling_you_could_kiss/,"For some reason I find myself in this situation very often, for example on a first date. See if you recognize this: you're talking, flirting, touching each other naturally, discussing sexually charged topics, making loads of sparkling eye contact, etc...

In other words, you have a feeling that you could go for the kiss, and she's very likely to reciprocate. But, both of you are *talking* all the time, and what's more, windows of opportunity for escalating don't last forever. Your rapport is great *now*, so you should escalate *now*. 

So what do you do, how can you force that magic moment where you gaze into each other's eyes, the world disappears, and you both go for a smooth kiss? In many dates/situations, there simply will never naturally occur such a situation. So here's my line preceding the kiss, romantic 'perfect' situation be damned:

***'Wait.'***

That's it. 

Whatever you're doing, be it walking from one venue to the next (as you should always try to do), or even simply happily chatting, or she's getting up from the table to go for a drink or whatever, just say *'wait'* as if you suddenly thought of something important, which will interrupt with a 'startle' whatever you were doing, then look her in the eyes, and kiss her.

Field tested at least a dozen of times, and it very rarely fails me, and it's great because that moment/feeling of 'damn, I'm pretty sure I could kiss her now, but I just can't find a good *moment* to do it' really can be quite dreadful. Not anymore.

This is why getting rejected is a good thing, you have increased your potential for happiness by taking a chance. I think every guy should be rejected at least ten times, to diminish fear of rejection so much that he can ask out any girl. One day the girl you talk to is a conceited cunt who calls you a creep, the next day, she's a lonely sweetheart who wishes so much that a guy would ask her out. She hates feeling so alone and would do anything to make a guy happy.

Go on, go get some numbers. If you get rejected, just put another coin into the arcade machine and try again with a different girl. 3 billion girls, 3 billion chances for happiness.

They're really easy to do in the course of your daily life, fun, and immediately rewarding. 

I love doing this shit so much. They keep me in state during the day, and help build my library of reference experiences. Here's a list of the ones I've played before, and I'd love to hear seddit's ideas of course! 

1.	**Peacock** -
Straightforward and exhilarating. You have to wear something ridiculous, and wear it proudly!

2.	**The eye contact game** -
This one is kinda addicting. Make an attempt at eye contact with every stranger you pass by all day—if you establish eye contact, *hold it*--THEY must be the first to break off. Challenge yourself to ""win"" this game more than 90% of the time.  

3.	**“Hello”** -
Also known as the “newbie mission”, you merely say “hello” and smile at every cute girl you see. Don’t skip any!

4.	**Asking strangers for directions** -
This is one of the most under-valued social games out there, in terms of raw humor. You will not believe how ridiculous it is to watch people struggle to come up with directions on the spot, especially if you already know where the place is! EXTRA CREDIT: when they are done explaining, go the exact opposite way that they said to go. 

5.	**Elevator challenge** -
*Level 1*: Get closer to the other people than you normally would (but not quite invading their personal space). Stand confidently in your spot—don’t lean on the walls/rail, don’t put your hands in your pockets or look at your phone! 
*Level 2*: Every time you’re in the elevator with someone else, make some remark. It can be anything (weather, elevator speed, recent sporting outcomes…), but you have to say something EVERY time.

6.	**Odd conversations** -
This one is best done with a buddy, although it still works solo. Come up with and exchange ridiculous conversation topics: each of you has to insert your topic into some conversation you have that day. For example, dinosaur metabolism….norwegian politics….anal fisting….

7.	**Numbers game** -
Friends heavily recommended for this one. Walk up to chicks and try to get their number right off the bat--no prior conversation allowed! This game is awesome because it forces you to focus explicitly on your physical and emotional calibration. Don’t be surprised if you and your friends actually do get several numbers; see who can get the most!

8.	**House party scramble** -
You and a friend compete to see who can meet everyone at a house party the quickest. Don’t be too fucking obvious about it (or do, and see what happens). 
Level 2: You have to remember all their names too. 

9.	**Freestyling**
That’s right. You’re going to try and come up with raps on the spot, and say them out loud. Even if you sound like a complete idiot and can’t rhyme at all, doing this boosts the fuck out of your mojo. Even better if you can do it around some friends.

Hey guys. I’ve been in the community for a while now (I’ve deleted my FRs because a few girls know this account, but I’m sure many of you remember me). I’ve used what I learned mostly to find great girlfriends, not to get laid hundreds of times. I just enjoy relationships. I've had a string of happy, healthy relationships that have all ended by my choosing and on very friendly, adult terms. I’m currently seeing someone new, and that is going great, too. 

Since relationships get almost no press in the community, I wanted to share a few insights. Please feel free to add on as you see fit. 

**Contents**

1. Women want to have fun

2. Women want to feel sexy

3. Women want to feel protected

4. Women want to feel loved


**INTRODUCTION**

Relationships are like the Big Bang of pick-up. All the rules break down. There are no routines to fall back on, and you are forced to reveal your truest self. What follows is a short list of principles I’ve found to be true in most relationships and for most (healthy) women. They are not rules. Think of them more as guidelines that can help you stay healthy, positive, and open while keeping things in perspective. Bombs away. 


**1. WOMEN WANT TO HAVE FUN**

The old song is true. Girls just want to have fun. If you and your girl don’t have fun, don’t expect her to stick around. This is why, in surveys, women consistently list a sense of humor as the most desirable trait in a partner. It is really difficult to overstate how much this is true. 

**1a.** Here’s what this means for you:

Learn to have fun at any time, no matter what you are doing. And don’t do it for her. Do it for yourself. If you can develop a sense of self-enjoyment, you will never be bored. For example, if you and your lady are walking, and you see a jungle gym, and she squeals and makes a break for it, don’t sulk and quietly wait for her to finish playing. Instead, run as fast as you can, push her out of the way, climb to the top, rip your shirt off, and scream, “I am the king and this is my kingdom! You will never defeat me, infidel!” And when she tries, pounce on her and tickle her until she pees in public. It doesn’t have to be that extreme, of course. Throw popcorn at her during a movie. If she drags you into a women’s clothing store, pull some shit off the rack, try it on, and ask the clerk’s opinion. Tackle her into bed. *Smile. Laugh.* Make some memories, for fuck's sake. Be playful, and never, ever say no to fun. 

**2. WOMEN WANT TO FEEL SEXY**

This seems like an easy one, but there’s a little nuance to it. Making a woman feel sexy is more than just complimenting her physical looks, although that’s part of it. Rather, it’s a mix of four things: 1) being interested in her mind, 2) complimenting her, 3) teasing her, and 4) having good sex. 

**2a.** Be interested in her mind.

If you aren’t interested in what your lady thinks, you are either too boring yourself, or you need to find someone with more similar interests. Have a good, long conversation once in a while. Ask her what she thinks and take her seriously. Again, don’t do it arbitrarily. Date women you are interested in. 

**2b.** Compliment and tease her.

Make it unique, sincere, and playful. Don’t get super emotional and tell her her eyes are like the sunset. Instead, when she walks away in that skirt you love, tell her you are about to have a stroke and you’d prefer if she just wore moo-moos from now on. Or whisper in her ear that her shoulders are giving you a boner in church. Say what you really think, and frame it in a way that’s fun. 

**2c.** Have good sex.

I’m no sexpert. I have a lot to learn myself. But having great, mutually fulfilling sex goes a loooong way toward making a woman feel sexy. If you need a starting point, read *The Sex God Method.* Some of the rhetoric is a little much (seems misogynistic at times, although it's clear he loves and respects women), but overall, it's a great book that focuses on the female psyche instead of bullshit “hum the ABCs” techniques. 


**3. WOMEN WANT TO FEEL PROTECTED**

Since you will almost never run across a situation in which you must actually protect a woman from harm, you need to find other ways to trigger the psychological response that makes her feel protected. 

Most of the time, this is pretty simple: maintain an attitude of confidence and control. This means acting like a happy, healthy, passionate man who is not pushed around and is generally unaffected by bullshit (even hers). It also means—and this is very important guys—finding and pursuing your own passion; if she doesn’t see that you are a man who is confident enough to do things on his own (and to let her do her own thing), she will never believe you are confident enough to protect her. 

**3a.** Real-world examples:

*Pay for her. She is your girlfriend. You take her out, not the other way around.

*Let her pay for you if she wants to. A confident man is secure.

*Decide. Be the decider, but be open to suggestions and/or changes of mind.

*Physically lead her. Take her by the hand and walk through crowds. Order first (better yet, order for her if you know what she likes). Walk into unfamiliar places first; open doors and guide her into familiar places. 

*Stick up for her. No one gets to talk shit to your woman. 

*Allow her to stick up for herself while supporting her with the quiet, physical presence of a confident man.

*Show her you have her back by empathizing, not by trying to fix situations. 


**4. WOMEN WANT TO FEEL LOVED**

This is the most straightforward and natural for most of us. However, there are still a few things to keep in mind. Expressions of love should happen in an exchange. They should never be used to win favor, to manipulate, to apologize, or to otherwise reconcile a power imbalance. Exchanging expressions of love should be happy, spontaneous and genuine. 

So, if you love a girl (and only ever say you do if you really do, obviously), and she loves you, tell her during positive emotional spikes. Say it when she makes you laugh or when she does something amazing. Say it when you are proud of her. Tell her you love her often during sex. The only real “rule” is to not say it to her more than she says it to you, but this is not due to some sort of misguided score system; it is simply because if she is not telling you she loves you as often as you are telling her, something in the relationship needs to be tweaked. 

Lastly, do thoughtful stuff. Buy good, thoughtful gifts for her birthday. Teach her something new. Make her breakfast. These are all expressions of love, and they really go a long way. 


**CONCLUSION: A BRIEF NOTE ON BEING ALPHA AND MYSTERIOUS**

It's true: you must be alpha. But don't think of it like you did during initial stages. In a relationship, being alpha more or less boils down to this: retaining your sense of self. A woman does not define you. A woman deserves a man with his own identity. Stay confident, positive, and passionate, and keep the above in mind. ""Being alpha"" is the natural result of being comfortable and healthy. 

*Mystery.* I've re-written this tiny section several times, but ultimately, this is what I came up with: surprise your girl once in a while and, again (and most importantly), retain a sense of self. 

Edit: Formatting; added the last section after a few PMs. Thanks, lads. :)

I took a lot but never gave back, so I hope this makes up for it. (Not a native English speaker, so I apologize in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors you may encounter). This is going to be a long one so I'll make sure to include a TL;DR before the lessons part.

**INTRO**

Alright so I'm just an average-looking 20 year old guy, sophmore in college. Never been a player or confident enough to hit on whatever girl I want to hit on, which is why I joined this subreddit. But I've been around a lot of girl-friends and got to understand how they think, and I've come across a stunning scientific anomaly: THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS, JUST LIKE US! I've had girlfriends before, and actually one of my relationships lasted for more than one year.

**THE CRUSH**

A month ago, I developed a crush on this really cute beautiful girl (probably a HB9) from my class (let's call her ""crush_girl""). She's the kind of girls that always seemed unreachable to me and way out of my league. She's always surrounded by the same group of friends, avoiding and rejecting random guys who try to hit on her, the usual..
I thought about her all the time, and I even started taking better care of myself hoping it would make her notice me

**THE OTHER GIRL**

Two weeks ago, as I was sitting alone in some lecture, a random girl came and sat right next to me (let's call her ""new_girl)"". She didn't seem attractive or anything to me, but I didn't allow myself to feel flattered. I thought that she probably didn't find any other seat and sitting next to me was her only choice. But then it hit me, I had promised myself to change, and that was something that the ""old-me"" would have thought. So I thought ""just fuck it, even though I have a huge crush on the crush_girl, I should probably talk to this one. She's sitting right there, next to me, I should at least practice what I learned from reading dozens of articles and FR's and prepare myself for the day I'll talk to the crush_girl. At least I'll have someone to talk to during the lecture instead of just sitting there awkwardly, trying to get the crush_girl to notice me as usual. What the hell am I gonna lose?""

So I assumed attraction and just went for it. I started talking to new_girl as soon as she sat next to me. A simple ""Hi I'm .. "" was more than enough to start a conversation. And then I tried to keep it going by asking her questions like what she was going to major in, where she's from.. Then she waved at some guy that I also knew ""Oh you know him? Yeah he's a cool dude bla bla. How do you know him bla bla"".
I honnestly wasn't trying to get anything out of this, I didn't even ask for her number. I walked her to her car after the lecture. A couple of friends saw me with her and came to talk to me as soon as she left. Apparently they were surprised to see me talking to a ""chick as hot as she is"". Of course at the time I was so blinded by the crush I had on crush_girl, thinking she was ""the one"" and all that kind of crap, that I hadn't even noticed that new_girl was a pretty attractive girl.

**ESCALATING**

Then I started getting to know her even better. I tried all the kind of games and tricks I read about. Some of them lead to awkward moments and silences, others got her laughing or punching me in the arm. I tried this little game with her: You ask the other person a question (any question), they have to give an honest answer. But then, you have to answer your own question too. It escalated things pretty fast and questions went from ""Did you ever get caught cheating in a test"" to ""Would you let me kiss you if I tried"". The reason why I was so comfortable talking to her right from the start was because I thought she was just a regular nice girl, I was still under the charm of crush_girl. My friends would see us talking or walking together and then tell me that I looked really ""comfortable"" and ""incredibly self-confident"". 

I got to a point of comfort where I would tease her about anything and manage to deal with her shit-tests:

- ""Oh thank you you're a life saver"". The ""old-me"" would've said ""Yeah sure you're welcome, any time"". I'd say ""Yeah I know, sometimes I wonder how you survived this far without me"" or ""Pfft yeah well don't get too used to it""

- After an original compliment/witty reply ""Hmm how long did it take you to come up with that?"". The old-me ""Hehhehe I just thought of that I dunno I .. "". The new me : ""Woke up 5am to practice it in front of the mirror"".

- ""Ugh do you actually say that kind of stuff to girls?"". Old-me : ""What? No that's not even.. I .. "". New me: ""Nope not really but I thought I'd practice on you"" (I know, the irony is strong in that one)

- I would say random shit and get away with it ""Yeah if you could just stop staring at my penis that would be great"". ""Ugh oh my god I wasn't I was just looking at.. Ugh oh my god"" *punch in the arm*

**THE CENTER OF ATTENTION**

She introduced me to her two best girl-friends, and just like that, those two girls became my friends. At this point I had started to feel attracted to her, but I didn't feel nervous as I usually would, because this time, she's not a stranger, we know each other, and I've already gone through the hard part. I felt that I was somehow falling for her and forgetting all about the crush_girl. (New_girl confessed that she was really into me as well and we'll be starting to go out right after the exams. Right now we're just busy studying and texting all the time. We really make each other happy and like each other a lot, and that's just what I've been looking for this entire time)

We would spend a lot of time together, the four of us, especially during lectures, just talking joking around and having fun. The funny thing here is, crush_girl started to notice us, and especially me. I went from being the random loner geeky guy to being the guy who's always surrounded by 3 cute girls, just laughing and having a great time. I would catch her staring at me, because I suddenly became this interesting mysterious guy who is the center of attention. I was having much more fun than her, and she was as usual surrounded by the same small group of friends who had apparently run out of things to talk or joke about.

******
**TL;DR:**
Had a huge crush on an unreachable girl. Practiced on another girl and felt pretty confident because I was only thinking about the crush (didn't care about what would happen with this other girl, only cared about the crush). Ended up seducing the girl without even meaning to. And now the crush is interested in me.
**********

**Lessons:**

*1)The crush:*
--------

""When you put someone on a pedestal, they have no choice but to look down upon you"". I know you're extremely attracted to your crush and feeling that she is the one, but don't think of her as some untouchable princess that will never notice you. In this very subreddit, a guy once told me ""imagine her taking a fat steamy shit"". It may sound gross, but what he's trying to say is that she's just another humain being. She's just like you. And who knows, you might even be more self-confident than her.

*2)She's not the only one:*
--------

I've had a lot of crushes, and I know how frustrating it can be (and how cliché it sounds) when someones tells you ""There are plenty more fish in the sea"", but hey're absolutely right. I understand why you would feel that she's the one, and that no other girl in the world could change your mind. And you know what? That's fine. Whatever. I'm not telling you to forgot about your crush, keep pursuing her, but in the meantime, don't forget to look around you. You never know when you might find another girl that could make you forget about her. Try to meet new people, hit on random girls. What the hell are you going to lose? Think of it this way: You're improving your game, you're just practicing on other girls, you don't have to go out with them or ask for their numbers. Just practice how to start a conversation, how to come up with witty and smart-ass replies, see which lines/tricks work and which ones don't..

*3)Hit on other girls:*
--------

As I explained in the previous paragraph, you should practice on other girls. You don't need to escalate, just try to get used to talking to girls and being around them. You shouldn't also completely forget about a girl you've just met. Keep in touch, you might end up becoming good friends. And then you'll probably get to know other people through her. And the best part about hitting on girls when you already have a huge crush on someone: you will probably only care about what the crush thinks, and feel that you don't really need to be accepted by other girls. Even the beautiful ones will probably look kinda ""regular"" to you because you are so blinded by the crush. All of this will give you a huge confidence boost when you're talking to them.

*4)Become a more sociable person:*
--------

No you don't have to become the most popular guy ever, just try to meet new people. Even guys! Some guys out there are really good bros and will help you meet more people and more girls.

Usually girls don't like loners and socially awkward guys. Being in a group of people (and if possible, the center of attention) whenever your crush sees you will definitely help.

*5)Take good care of yourself:*
--------

Girls are sensitive, loving and caring beings. No girl will completely ignore you just because you are not good looking enough, as long as you have a certain amount of self-confidence. (If they do, they're probably shallow bitches who aren't even worthy of your time anyway). BUT! That doesn't mean you can hit on girls with a 2 weeks old beard, wearing pyjamas, smelling like sweat and expect them to not reject you.
Shave. Get a good haircut. Dress properly (Check [MFA](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/) for help). Get rid of the bad smells. ""Never expect people to treat you any better than you treat yourself"".

*6)Don't forget that girls are human beings:*
--------

They are human beings and you shouldn't feel stressed when you're around them yeah we have covered this already. But what I want to say here is that if you hit and practice on other girls, keep in mind that they are people, with feelings. If you're practicing, don't escalate things too much, don't let them think that you're really into them and would like to take them out if you're not really interested. It's okay to practice, but don't hurt people, and never game a girl too hard, [you never know what the consequences might be](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14qyxo/fr_met_a_girl_on_the_street_three_days_later_i/)


*7)It doesn't matter what you say:*
--------

I thought about dozens of openers and lines to use the day I'll have enough courage to talk to the crush. But when it came to a random other girl, I just said ""Hi I'm .. "". That's it. Openers don't matter, you can still use them, but they're not that important. Say whatever you want, as long as you look self-confident when you do it.

You're not self-confident? Well then fake it! Don't look at the floor, look up, try to maintain some eye contact, and assume that the girl you're talking to is as much into you, as you are into her.

Here are 2 of my favourite threads about openers [[Buttcheese](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/19g9so/field_report_challenge_given_by_a_redditor_to/)]
[[Spoons eh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/197aqt/a_little_advice_for_those_of_you_struggling_with/)]

**Ending:**

Well, that's it! I can't really think of anything else to say. If I remember something I'll add it later. And just keep in mind that I'm not some professional pickup artist or player. I'm just a regular college guy who has finally decided to change his life and put everything he has ever learned into action.

I'd like to think that everything I said here can also help girls.

Alright now, I'm gonna stop here. Any feedback/criticism is more than welcome!

Edit : Spelling

Edit2: Wow this is definitely much more that what I was expecting. It feels so good to know that I'm actually helping people. All the replies and comments are great, keep them coming! And to think that I was gonna give up on this post when it first got caught in the spam filter. I'm glad I messaged the mods. Thank you guys!

Edit3: Alright I'm going to bed. I'll be back tomorrow I promise! I love you guys!

Edit4: I'm back. If you're looking for more tips and ideas, there are plenty in the comment! A lot of them are much better than mine.

Check the sidebar if you haven't already. That's how I started as soon as I subscribed to this sub. You can also find a lot of good posts in the [top Seduction posts of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all)

There are some pretty good Youtube channels like [Simple Pickup](http://www.youtube.com/user/SimplePickup/featured) (These guys will show you how you can still get a girl's number no matter what you say or how you say it. It really helps for people who suffer from approach anxiety). There is also RSD but I only watched the videos that got upvoted here.

1340208828.0,1204,self.seduction,vc108,How I un-friend zoned myself [FR],1504,300,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vc108/how_i_unfriend_zoned_myself_fr/,"Sit down folks and let me tell you a story on how I not only entered the friend-zone but I managed to escape.  Now I wouldn’t say I’m a novice to the seduction methods around here, but I am far from being good at it as you will see.

This story starts off with your typical boy meets girl (whom I will refer to as Kate) story.  I met Kate at a local book store while I was out and about.  I believe I went in to buy the hard back copy of one of my favorite books or a cook book.  That is not important.  What is important is that I spied this beautiful little Asian girl with a copy of John Keats’s complete work tucked under her arm.  I quickly worked my way over to her and opened her with a “Is that for school or are you looking for the right romantic words to say to me?”  She laughed and told me that she liked his works and it had nothing to do with her Masters.  I told her that he was one of my favorite poets and recited one of the verses from a poem he wrote from memory.  The look on her face told me that I had performed the equivalent of bringing her to a raging orgasm while she was tripping on ecstasy.   I quickly made an excuse to leave and handed her my phone while I went to purchase whatever I was buying.  By the time I had finished with my purchase I had her phone number, e-mail , and name already programmed into my phone.  She even dialed her phone to make sure I could return the favor.  

Over the next few weeks we went out a few times, but each date was unique and a bag full of mixed signals.  One date she was buying me drinks and grinding against me while we played pool; the next date she was acting as nervous as if I had told her that Chris Brown was my personal idol.  What had made it worse is that I still could not K-close her.  By the third date I had grown tired of the game and started to shut her out, which normally works on most girls but on this one just made her grow even more distant.  I finally asked her what was wrong and she explained that she was considering taking a job across the country after she finished her courses at the end of the year.  She didn’t want to be in a relationship and wouldn’t do anything intimate (including kiss) if she was going to move.  After a bit of discussion she asked if I would be ok with just being friends.  I stupidly agreed because I had fallen under her spell.

Fast forward a few weeks and we are hanging out regularly.  With the exception of her not introducing me to her friends she has pretty much by all definitions become a regular facet in my life.  Then one of my good friends (and wingmen) called me out on it.  Damnit, I have become her platonic mate.  This would not do.  So over the next few weeks I became unavailable and stopped being the AFC.  Then it happened.  We went out to a local bar after a movie and while she was texting her sister I got up and started talking to another girl.  I came back to this angry eyed, 5’2, ball of seething rage.  How could I disrespect her by hitting on another girl and getting a # close in front of her.  I calmly looked her in the eyes and smiled.   “Kate you know how I like when you put on that angry face, but I need you to stop trying to seduce me.  We are friends remember?”  She glared at me a few moments and told me that it she didn’t think that I would be so callous about it.  I just shrugged and told her next time I would leave her to get the number while she was around.  The next day we hung out I had brought along my friend Rob (the same wingman) out with me to play pool.  During one of the rounds I had struck up a conversation with waitress who was now slipping us free shots.  Kate had now started to find little excuses to talk to me when she came around till I decided the CB needed to stop.  I looked at her and asked her what she thought of the waitress.  She immediately gave me negative ideas and tried to down play the girl’s looks and such.  I asked Rob and he told me that maybe the free shots was to help her chances and not mine.  I decided to play this to my advantage and told Kate she would be my wingman since Rob obviously was going to be too objective tonight.   I then suggested we go approach another table of girls and get them to join our game.  The look in her face told it all.  This girl was good at playing her game, but telling her that I wanted other people to play with her toy was like asking her to put down old yeller.  She begrudgingly went over and helped me successfully open the girls.  Fellas, even at their worst women negate another women’s defenses.  Soon both tables were playing and having fun.  Here was two guys surrounded by a group of HB6s and 7s (Kate still being a 9).  Kate left after two rounds stating she needed to work on a paper for school.

Several days go by and we don’t talk and I go on with my life.  Then the other day she calls me up and asks me what I’m doing.  I told her I am cooking dinner and asks if she wants to join me.  Even though she lives about an hour away via public transportation she got a taxi and was over at my place in 30 minutes.  We sat down and had a nice dinner and decided to watch some TV.  Without asking, she starts to massage my neck and offering to give me a rub down I wouldn’t forget.  I agree and we reposition so that she can straddle me to work on my back.  After about 5 minutes I start feeling her lips on the back of my neck.  I jokingly remind her that this isn’t a massage I normally let my friends give me.  To my surprise she stopped and collapsed on top of me and try to make out with me.  It was the most awkward thing that I have ever seen anyone try to do and I immediately started to laugh at her.  She then told me trying to be my friend was the worst decision she ever made and desperately wanted another chance to be more.  To paraphrase her “Being your friend was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.  I was fine with it at first but watching you hit on other girls and have fun with them made me realize what I wanted and couldn’t have”.  Other words were said, but honestly I don’t remember.  We ended up with an Fclose that night with another session scheduled for tomorrow.

So the lesson I have learned is this.  If a woman friend-zones you, turn them into your friend.  Treat them like one of the guys and ask them to wing with you.  The worst thing that can happen is that they turn out to be a bad wingman and you have to spend time training them.  The best that can happen is what happened to me.

TL/DR: Met a girl.  Ended up being Friend-zoned.  Forced girl to experience what it is like to be friend.  She came back begging to be more.

Period.,1509,328,149,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1a19tx/do_not_deal_with_shitty_women_period/,"Again, I find myself reacting to some ""how to"" advice that appeared on Seddit, giving some people helpful advice about how to pass their days as pleasantly as possible while they're dating a harpy.

My question is, **[why are you dating this kind of woman](http://tabletheory.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/dating-tropes-explained-part-vii-shit-tests-and-crazy-women/)?**

This ultimately goes back to the concept of the **shit test**.

See, there's a lot of advice here about shit tests and how to pass them. The advice, by itself, isn't bad. Most of it is about having a backbone, maintaining frame, not letting another person's actions affect who you are, and **always having the will and wisdom to walk away from a bad deal.**

See, that last part is what everyone forgets, because they get so invested in ""winning"" the shit test that they don't realize that it's a shitty game, and the prize at the end is that you get to spend even more time with an unbearable succubus.

You get into a relationship with an HB8.5, and suddenly the rules go out the window. Suddenly, you're making excuses for her behavior, because you don't wanna lose her.

We have a word for that. It's called oneitis. And passing shit tests doesn't cure it.

Without the will to walk away from a bad deal, just because she looks pretty or does that thing you like with the bacon grease and the three-pronged dildo, you've lost in LIFE.

And the worst thing about oneitis is that it becomes how you operate in your whole life. You understand that? That it no longer extends to just you and this woman?

That there is something wrong with your LIFE if you let ANYONE mistreat you like this and you just stand there and take it?

If you're the kind of guy who thinks ""how do I pass this shit test,"" you need to ask yourself first ""is this woman even worth it?""

Just because you let someone peg you on ""your terms"" doesn't mean you're not getting fucked in the ass. Don't ever forget that.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1362942336.0,,,True,t3_1a19tx,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1a19tx/do_not_deal_with_shitty_women_period/,

**Edit: I was only expecting two people or so to care about this, so WOW!!! I'm speechless reddit! Just hit #1 in /r/seduction, I am honored. I'm still reading every comment.**

Basically, this is how I changed my life, AMA.

Starting Point
---------------
*****
I was 25, only had 1 girlfriend who I lost virginity to. Small kid in highschool, I was the picked on, geeky kid. No real romantic involvement until my first girlfriend at 17(lasted 8 years). Had a crush on my best friend from 14-17, we hung out everyday, never really made a move(fml). I really believed no girl would find me sexy. I had never called a girl, flirted with one, gone on a date, none of that. At 25. This was 2 years ago.

However I had a lot of positives going for me. First, I had insane confidence in my abilities to learn and live life. Even though I didn't think a girl would be sexually attracted, I have a great career, lot of interesting skills and a great life. I believed I had value and I trusted myself to act correctly. Second, I am a performer(actor, magician), since a young age I've loved being the center of attention, even in beta ways. This helped me be comfortable at opening and telling stories, even though stories had a lot of low value qualities in them.

Beliefs
-------
*****


* People self-reinforce roles that have worked for them in the past

From a young age, I realized I could get through school by being a class clown, backing down when bullied. Once that worked, and it was how my social circle saw me, any attempt to act as the alpha or popular was met with resistance. You see this all the time, you can take a popular kid, move them to a new school and next thing you know they are a goth kid getting picked on. The ""alphas"" are not alpha by special talent or ability, they took the role at a young age by chance, and continually were self-reinforced in that role. This means your ""role"" is a **choice**, and you can change it anytime you want.

* You are what you think.

It is pretty much proven that if you constantly think negative sad thoughts, you will be sad. If you think positive thoughts, you will be happy. We are what we think, and what we think is a controllable process. If you can't stop thinking ""I'm so worthless, I can't attract a woman"", then you won't be able to.

* If you expect to find evidence of something, you will.

This is a natural process, and it is a good one. (within reason, when monitored) If you go through life looking for X, then you will find evidence for X where you might not have seen it, and ignore conflicting evidence. If you look for Y, then same thing, meaning you might ignore X. This has a huge impact on your life, and it places extreme importance on what you are looking for and expect to find rather than the data(experience) itself. So if you go out, expect to find women who are attracted to you, rather than looking for reasons they aren't.

* People respond to you how you expect to be treated.

Random high quality people you meet have no idea who you are as a person. No one really does, and we can't take weeks to judge people. So we expect everyone to self-broadcast their social standing, and if unsure we test them, if they respond to the test then we believe them. If you ""Hack"" the system, there is no way for them to challenge you. How could Brad Pitt prove he is a successful guy and sex symbol if stuck in some bar in the middle of nowhere with people that haven't seen his movies? What would stop you from acting the same and convincing an entire bar you are a movie star?

* Focus on internal change not results.

If your goal is to get 20 #'s or to kiss 2 girls, and then you don't get that due to random chance, then you failed. You feel sad, you wonder what went wrong. Screw that! You should focus on doing your best, having a good time. Don't be outcome dependent! Just do your best, and trust yourself. This avoids collecting evidence against your progress and stops you from giving yourself reasons to fail. Often my goal is just ""Make someone smile"" when approaching a set. I always win!!!

###Controlling Thought:

####Thinking good things

This is the easy one. Repeat good beliefs, attitudes and expectations in your head. Force yourself to think this over and over.(Even if it isn't true yet or you don't believe it)

My persona is:

* I have a lot of women in my life, and I am used to them chasing me
* I am extremely picky with women as my time is valuable
* I am high value, leader of men, relaxed, and sexual. Alpha mindset
* I often take 10's home for a night of mutual fun with no expectations
* I meet a lot of cool people in my life, this is normal for me

What I expect and look for:

* Every girl here is trying to seduce me and take me back to her place
* Every bump, smile, laugh is a thinly veiled attempt to seduce me
* Guys look to me to lead, seek my approval and give them value

Most of this stuff is easily learnable from standard pickup/seduction sources, but you really need to drill it in your head and respond genuinely as if that is where you are coming from.

**Edit:** I felt like an actor getting into character. I wasn't saying these things as affirmations, but I was figuratively ""getting into the head"" of someone with abundance in success with women. I forced myself to believe girls flirting with me was normal and expected, even though in the beginning I knew that wasn't the case. Slowly this became more real for me, until I believed it completely. Even now I do this before going out or before a date just to stay sharp and focused, however it is more like remembering things about myself rather than as an actor getting into character.

####Not thinking bad things

This is much more difficult and where everyone has trouble. You need to be able to control your thoughts, and shut off your mind. I am going to use this word, but don't freak out: **Meditation.**

I am not talking about sitting in front of a wall, lighting incense, playing soothing music or any crap. Meditation is about having a tool to shut off your brain's internal chatter. This takes practice, but you can do it at work, in the grocery line, at a bar: anywhere, anytime. Just focus on a spot, on a sound, on your breathing whatever, and let any thoughts briefly pass and move on. Do this until you can consciously avoid the thoughts from forming in the first place, until you can silence the noise. This is a skill you get better at over time, after awhile you'll be amazed how easy this becomes!

Now everytime you find yourself listing reasons to fail, reliving failures or negative stuff, take 5-10 seconds and stop yourself. Take 5 minutes if you need to, but once you silence them, replace them with good thoughts and beliefs.

###Memories:

Make a list of your successes, your good memories. Maybe it was just a girl smiling at you, maybe it was a kiss, maybe it was a wild threesome. Lock those in and force yourself to remember them, let them give you confidence.

####The Persona

Brief explanation of why persona is important over ""Tactics"". A million things you are not ready for will come up, and you need to respond like someone who often has amazing sexual relationships with women. Beyond all the words you say or kino you do, you need to have this larger ""world-view"" reality setup where it is a normal thing to meet a girl and take them home. Many PUA guys will entertain, neg, do kino all the right stuff, but don't close because it is not what they expect and not part of their reality that they project.

The Process
--------------
*****

About 30 minutes before going out, get yourself into a good space. Relive your successes, repeat your expectations and positive mindsets. I keep this up until I get to the club, date or daygame spot. This gives you a chance to see if any negative thoughts are coming up, and practice shutting them down.

Once there, I'm monitoring body for tension. If my shoulders are getting tight or whatever, deep breaths focusing on everything to relax. If it is mental, then I stare at my drink or the wall for 30 seconds and meditate, shutting out all thought. Often, I'll get some female eye contact that breaks me out of this(be aware of your surroundings). Be looking for your expectations to be fulfilled, notice the IOIs(smiles, laughs, touches) you get.

Afterwards, remember the night, again focus on your successes. Going through failures is fine, but once you think through them once, tell yourself ""I've learned everything I can from that, and thinking about it longer is just harmful"" then meditate and shut it out.

Along the way, look for really deep changes. My big sticking point was not thinking I could be sexy or ""make a girl horny"". It was hard, but slowly I started to believe I could. This was bolstered with evidence from girls telling me how sexy I am, getting makeouts, threesomes, etc. It took awhile and was a leap of faith to just let myself believe it. I haven't looked back.

Everything here is Club/Ultra Lounge Game/Bar Game with 6s who think they're 8s and 8s who think they're 10s, and 9s who think they're God's Gift to humanity.

The most asked question to any man good with women is ""So what did you say to her?"". Men assume there is some universal line that all women swoon for. I usually tell them ""Just be honest, say what's really on your mind, she already knows you're there because you want to sleep with her.""

But then I thought, ""Why can't there be a universal line? Something simple and charming enough to throw out on any woman?"" So what I did was go out and use a variety of canned openers and saw which one got me the best responses. The winner:

""Tell me, are you as interesting as you look?""

We've all used it a dozen times, but what I found is, when I used it exclusively, I never failed. I didn't always get a kiss or a one night stand, but I never bombed. Ever. I used it on women by themselves, small groups, large groups, every race and ethnicity I can think of and I never got blown out of the water. 

It hits everything you want: Confident, Challenging, Honest. Your focus when meeting new women is to find out ""What She's Like"" and this line gets straight to the point. It also gets her hamster spinning like nothing else: ""Is interesting good or bad"" ""What about me does he find interesting"" ""Oh god what if i'm not interesting at all and he  leaves"". You instantly demonstrate higher value with one simple question because you're challenging her to live up to your expectations. 

In recent weeks I've used this line exclusively and everywhere, from Bars/Grocery Stores to OKCupid and PlentyofFish. I've never had success like this. Ever. 

What I'm looking for is for the men of seddit to play around with this line and let me know how it works for you.

1355350235.0,1047,self.seduction,14qyxo,[FR] Met a girl on the street. Three days later I had her in bed. Four days after that she told me she loved me...,1459,412,265,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14qyxo/fr_met_a_girl_on_the_street_three_days_later_i/,"...which her boyfriend probably wasn't too happy about.

This was one of my first real pickups since I started reading this subreddit, and it was one of my most important learning experiences. I've been meaning to write a FR about it for a while, but never really got the time until now. It's a long story, which I'll try to present truthfully, the good and the bad. Suffice it to say it's a story about how powerful this stuff can be; and, perhaps, a cautionary tale about what can happen if you wield that power recklessly.

**FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD**

I was out for a walk on a beautiful spring afternoon, and I spied a cute Asian girl taking pictures with an expensive looking camera. I'd spent months slowly whittling down my approach anxiety by pushing myself to do daytime street approaches, so I was able to seize the opportunity without hesitation. I strolled right up to her:

""Excuse me.""

She turned around, startled.

""Hi! I saw you over here, and I thought you were really cute so I wanted to come meet you.""

She looked even more startled. I extended my hand.

""I'm FoodNinja. What's your name?""

Long pause. ""............Katie."" (Not her real name, obviously).

""Nice to meet you Katie. So what are you up to today?""

""......Um.......I have a boyfriend.""

I was actually relieved. She had a BF so it wasn't going to go anywhere. I could just relax and experiment, see how far I could push things before getting blown out. ""Aw, why'd you go and do a silly thing like that?""

She cracked a little smile for the first time. ""Like what? Get a boyfriend?""

""What's the camera for?""

She told me about the project she was working on for class, her major in school, etc. Basic small talky stuff. She asked me what I was up to.

""Oh, just taking a walk and accosting random women. Y'know, the usual.""

She laughed a little, but was clearly uncomfortable. She said, ""Well, good luck with that. Have a nice day,"" in a clear attempt to end the conversation.

I held strong eye contact and said, ""I'm still going to ask for your number.""

She stared back. ""Why?""

""Because you're cute, and I want to take you on a date.""

""I have a boyfriend. I told you that.""

I flashed a sly smile and said, ""I'm more fun than you boyfriend is.""

Her eyes widened a little bit. I asked what her boyfriend did, and it turned out he was living in China.

""Are you serious? C'mon, he's all the way over there, and I'm right here. He sounds boring. Give me your number, and we'll have fun and no one will ever have to know."" At this point I was thinking to myself, *There's no way in hell this girl is going to give me her number.* So I was just goofing around for my own amusement, trying to get blown out to boost state for the next approach of the day.

She said, ""I'm only going to be here for two more weeks. I'm leaving for Taiwan for the summer.""

""That's fine, we can have a brief and passionate affair and then disappear from each other's lives. It's romantic.""

I pulled one of my favorite moves: I looked quizzically down at her hand. ""Can I see your hand for a sec?"" She cautiously held her hand out, and I took it, smiled, and said, ""Awesome.""

Her jaw dropped. She said, ""I don't know...I don't know what to do right now."" She no longer looked uncomfortable. She looked actually *scared*.

I pulled out my phone. ""Give me your number. You can either ignore my texts or we can go out. It'll be up to you."" She gave me her number while I was still holding her hand, and I was pretty sure she just did it to get rid of me. I left, chuckling to myself and convinced that nothing would ever come of it.

**KNOCK HER OFF THE FENCE**

A few days later I was getting ready to call up another girl I had met that week. I was feeling kind of out of it, so I decided to call up Katie, thinking that I'd get a quick phone warmup before calling the other girl. I was mildly surprised when Katie actually answered.

We made small talk for a bit. I asked if she wanted to get together for coffee. ""Maybe, if we go as friends,"" she said. I asked when she was free, and she said Wednesday of the following week she ""might"" be available. She was being very wishy-washy about everything, the way a woman gets when she doesn't want to go out with you but doesn't want to actually say no. So I decided to apply the [""Knock Her Off the Fence""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgLJTYCSYs0) principle and go for broke:

""Just so we're clear, if we get together I'm going to kiss you.""

Silence. ""....Why would you say that? I have a boyfriend.""

""I'm more fun than he is. I told you that. You don't have to kiss me back, and I'm not even sure there will be any chemistry between us, but if there is, I'm going to kiss you.""

"".....Maybe we shouldn't meet up then.""

""Suit yourself. I'll text you Wednesday. We'll go out or we won't. It's up to you.""

""If we go out.....are you sure you'll try to kiss me?""

""We'll see.""

I hung up, certain that I'd just creeped her out and I was never going to hear from her again. But whatever, it was just the warmup.

**THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE**

That night I got off work around 11pm. I was walking to my car and checking my messages for the first time all day.

Katie had sent me a text: ""Hey FoodNinja do you already have plans tonight? If not wanna hang out tonight instead? I don't want to study""

I froze in the parking lot. Up to this point I was positive that I had creeped this girl out. In fact, I was *trying* to creep her out, just for the rejection therapy. It never even occurred to me that she would respond with anything other than disdain. And yet...

If this happened to me today, I wouldn't go for it. But I was in a months-long dry spell and deep in scarcity mindset. I didn't have the willpower to act with honor, and my penis overrode my higher thinking. And I would come to regret it.

I texted her back, and we met up at a spot on campus. We went for a walk. She was really nervous (so was I, honestly), so I dropped the PUA act and we had a genuine conversation. We walked around campus, talking, getting to know each other. We started playing the question game. I told her, ""You can ask me whatever you want. I don't lie."" So she started asking me all these questions about my personal life, which I answered truthfully. Hell, I even told her about the pickup tactics I use, which she found fascinating.

Eventually, we ended up sitting next to each other in a park, around 1am or so. She said, ""I don't know what you want. I have a boyfriend."" I asked about him, and it turned out he was a controlling, abusive asshole, and she was miserable in the relationship. Still doesn't make it ok, but my penis used it as justification. We talked some more, about the future, our hopes, dreams, fears, etc.

""Look at me,"" I said. She looked at me for a second, then giggled and looked away. ""Hey, hey. Look at me."" We held eye contact for a long silence. Our knees touched. My heartbeat picked up. I said, ""Close your eyes.""

""Are you sure?"" she asked.

""Close your eyes."" She did. I kissed her. It was fucking electric.

She pulled away and giggled. ""Oh my god, I can't believe I just did that with an American guy,"" she said. Apparently I'm a fetish.

She invited me back to her place. On the way there, she told me that she was really nervous, because she'd never done anything so ""American"" before. I said (and this was probably the most seductive thing I said all night), ""Just relax. There's no pressure. Whatever you want to do or not do is totally fine. We're just having fun right now."" I could actually feel her melt when I said that, and when we got back to her place, it was magic.

**I'M IN LESBIANS WITH YOU**

We met up again a few days later. We picked up some stuff at a grocery store and went for a picnic (one of my favorite date templates). We ended up back at my place watching YouTube videos and making fun of each other's Facebook profiles. We started making out, clothes came off. I put the condom on and was *just* about to go in when she said it.

I froze. The world entered Bullet Time. I tried to pretend like I didn't hear her, but she stopped me, looked me right in the eyes and repeated it.

""I love you.""

I had started to feel like she was actually beginning to fall for me a little in the previous few days, but I was in no way prepared to hear that. It hit me: she wasn't a ""target"" or a ""HB"" or any of that stupid bullshit. She was a goddamn human being, one in a very confused emotional place. I realized I had gamed this girl way too hard, and was going to have to deal with the consequences.

We had a long conversation about it. I made it clear that, while I wasn't super freaked out or anything, I was not going to return that sentiment, and that my life situation made a serious relationship impossible. She told me she appreciated my honesty and the fact that I wasn't being weird about it. She told me all about her relationship, and I listened and gave her what advice I could. We talked through the night, and I dropped her off at her place the next morning. She left for Taiwan a couple days later. We kept in touch through the summer, and the last I heard she had dumped the asshole BF and was reconnecting with old friends and finding the ""old Katie,"" as she put it.

**LESSONS?**

* Be bold. I've lost attraction for being too timid far more often than for being too forward. Even if she seems creeped out, you might still have a good shot.

* DGAF. I was self-amused and outcome-independent because I thought her having a BF killed my chances. Ironically, this attitude ended up boosting my chances.

* Knock her off the fence. Whether she loves you or hates you, you're still in better shape than if she just thinks you're ""pretty nice.""

* Tell the truth. There's nothing sexier than someone totally comfortable in their own skin. My rule is that I never lie to a woman I'm attracted to, not out of a moral code, but because honesty is incredibly seductive.

* Take the pressure off. She's been conditioned to think that sex is a huge deal. Remind her that it's just for fun and doesn't need to be anything more than that. Being cool and nonjudgmental about sex will go a long way.

* Be clear in your intentions. If you don't want a relationship, make sure to communicate that from the start. Be careful about having deep conversations if you're not really seeking a relationship with her. There's such a thing as *too much* rapport building, which can cause her to feel a deeper emotional connection than you're willing to reciprocate.

* Don't sleep with women in relationships. Everyone has to make their own choice about it, and I'm not about to debate morality with those who like to grandstand over the internet, but in this case it ended up being far more trouble than it was worth. If she clearly states that she's in an open or not-too-serious relationship, that's one thing, but if she's actually emotionally invested in her relationship, GTFO. She'll end up projecting a lot of that emotion onto you, whether by coming to hate you (and telling everyone she was drunk and you took advantage of her), or convincing herself that she feels a deeper connection than is really there. Too much guilt, drama and baggage for those few fleeting moments of pleasure. And to this day I'm a little afraid that the psycho ex-BF is going to come at me with a machete.

*-Dave Chappelle*

Yea, I know you guys probably don't wanna hear it but I need to lay it out like I see it. **This subreddit has become (majority of posts anyway) all pep-talk with little to no game plan.** This is the ""norm"" it seems in the pick-up community. **Why!?** 

Guys, this current paradigm really needs to shift. Let me explain.

When a coach of a football team sits down with his boys to give 'em **""the talk""** before the big game, he does so in order to heighten the inner-game of the players necessary to win. The talk heightens their spirits, and if done right...put's them in the zone to outmatch the competition. It could be argued that without building a strong inner-game, a player can never truly become a great one, only an amateur at best...and I would agree fully agree with this notion.

----
***Have you forgotten all the meticulous training exercises, the practice runs, the tactical plays, positioning, counter-plays, and overall game plan that is essential to every great player's (of any sport or game) success???***
----

These ""pep-talks"" of inner-game only work for people who know what they are doing but for some reason have psyched themselves out of it for the given situation. *Who the fuck do you think browses this subreddit?* Newbies, amateurs, and would-be masters who seek content; content that is *simultaneously* useful and inspiring to get them to step their game up to the next level. 

The current paradigm here: ""Blah blah blah natural this, natural that. Blah blah she'll see right through your phony routines. Blah blah it doesn't matter what you say, it's how you project yourself.""

Well good for fucking you Mr. affirmative natural. Here's your karma for sounding profound. But you know what, you just made me ""the-not-so-successful-with-women guy"" feel inferior in the fact that you can talk to yourself and beast it up, while I fail like a loser when going in with such self-talk because I've got nothing to go on once in set.

----

***Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory, tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat***

*~Sun Tzu*

----

*Example of seddit's popular inner-game centered post:*

""It is up to you to decide that you are the man. Are you somehow an inferior man if a woman rejects you? No. You are still the man, and only you can make that reality for yourself. Only once you believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have exactly what it takes and that you truly deserve the hottest girl in the room, can you actually get her. It doesn't matter too much what you say to her...do the approach with the knowledge that no matter what happens, you are still the man. Be completely outcome independent, present to the moment, and don't take yourself too seriously. Women will pick up on it and you will in turn, pick-up the women.""

*Example of less popular outer-game centered post:*

""Hey guys I've just used this really awesome set of techniques. When you see the HB you want at a club, stick your tongue out at her. If she smiles, go in and talk to her. Follow up with a 'Hey I'm Anon, who are you?' Move in with a cold-read, 'you look like a person who is willing to work really hard to get where you want to be, I bet that hasn't been all that easy for you has it?' Go off that tangent until it begins to die. Then move in with the passions and interests. Pry for hers first, then when she asks you...make an absurd, yet plausible passion and be serious about it 'I'm very much want to be hot-dog eating champion, I train every week...blah blah blah'. Let her buy into it a little before busting her balls. This is a great way to tease her. Then move on to your real passions (be ready to deliver clearly, concisely, and passionately) if the situation calls for it.""

----

*Now let me ask you, which post is more helpful?*

The outer-game one obviously. Because it has material, it has actual useful information that can be tested. Inner-game ""wisdom"" has the edge because in the end it is a far more attractive image than the one of some guy using lines and routines to run his game. 

Let me say though, ***I have had outer-game save my ass when my inner-game was failing.*** Once when I was taking a girl home to my place (I had lived with my mom when this pick-up happened), and she was adamantly refusing to go back with a guy who lived with his mom. I was very anxious and feeling like I could lose her. She wanted to get a hotel...I didn't have to money for it. She then told me to take her home because she was not cool with staying at someone's mom's house. 

So I had used what I had learned from *Influence* by Robert Cialdini. I worked my way up using the ""foot-in-the-door"". I told her, ""Hey, we are just gonna stop by my house as I needed to get something and then we could go to a hotel"" She said okay. Got to my place. ""Hey, we're already here you should just come in."" She was NOT having it.

""I am not comfortable with this at all. Take me home now! I am not sleeping at your mom's house. I've done this before and it's always fucking awkward and the parents always fucking come in or wake up or something! NO, take me home, this is not cool!""

I thought I was pretty fucked, but I had remember what Adam Lyons had said about a similar LMR story he had with a Latvian (or Estonian) girl in Las Vegas. She was refusing to go into his place even though he had solid plausible deniability. And he said if you ever had trouble to look at her sincerely, and calmly yet affirmatively say, **""Trust me, it will be fine""** and repeat however much necessary. 

Thank you Adam, because I did just that. I played my cool outside, dropped this line. Did some explaining and reassurance that she would not meet my mom at all and I'd have her home by morning. Met with some but less resistance and request to go home again. Said that's fine if that's what she really wanted, but [insert more explaining and reassurance] finalized by ""Listen, trust me everything will be fine."" 

And ending with the victory of, ""I hate you"" said in a resentfully playful manner while she exited the vehicle and walked with me to the front door. We both tip-toed to my room, got in bed, and got down to business. This was a class-A example of how without outer-game I would have been fucked (and not in the way I was hoping for). 

So please Seddit, let us pay more attention to it and perhaps mix the best of both worlds in the same post. 

**TL;DR: Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say but nothing comes out. When they move their lips just a buncha inner-game gibberish. And mothafuckas act like they forgot about outer-game.**

EDIT: Some folks have pointed out to the sidebar or noted the plethora of old mPUA routines that already exist. I am seeking *new* content as so many others are. I don't like telling a girl she looks fashionable to open, the Jealous-girlfriend routine runs like a disaster for me. I like to gauge intrigue right off the bat and ""Hi, I'm Anon I'm being myself"" runs a little flat for me. I am looking for content I can really connect with that has chemistry with my own style of seduction. So that is why I ask: Where are the latest developments in field tested material. I'm looking for the new shit guys, and reddit has the best layout to deliver new material.

EDIT2: Really glad to see strong support for this guys! I'm feeling very inspired to test some new/lost styles of seduction (congruent to my reality, not popular demand) that I have been developing. Will do field reports and I hope you guys promote the same. Hope there is a shift in demand for details regarding both inner and outer game that are both unique, specific, and testable in the field. Oh and as the name suggest, I am very very sick of white knight parades on this subreddit. The FRs I seek can and will be taboo if I can help it. But most importantly, I will pay attention to the ""why and how"" mechanics of seduction. Hope to see more of the same. Thanks guys!

To do this, I recommend they regularly go back to mundane places such as supermarkets, malls, stores, public transportation, parks, happy hour bars, etc. Going back consistently to these predictable places will give you a foundation to practice your approach skills and learn how to initiate interactions with strangers.

However, this is a very different thing than actually having a life where you do interesting activities and things you enjoy. Almost anywhere you live in the world, you can find a ton of hidden activities that can enrich your life.

I used to be friends with a guy who *always* seemed to know about great activities to do. If liking him as a person wasn’t enough, the fact that he always knew where to go and what to do was enough reason for me to keep this guy in my life.

Be that guy. Become the expert at finding fun things to do. When you always have your plate full with fun activities, you naturally start to draw people into your life. You have a base for relating to other people. 

I like to ask my clients, if you had the perfect woman in your life, what kind of things would you be doing with her?

Yes, pickup can teach you to become proficient and confident in any environment you’re in. But beyond the first date, if you don’t have interesting things going on in your life, it will be very difficult to keep women in your life. And the ones that you do keep will be *boring*.

Here are some important tips to finding great things to do every night of the week:

**Make It Your Job to Find Fun Activities**

There are a number of magazines, events lists, and websites that talk about all the great things going on in your city. My favorite guide right now is Time Out. They have Time Out magazine in almost every major city. Once a week, I sit down and go through Time Out New York. I read it like it’s a homework assignment. Anything that interests me, I put into my calendar or look it up online. I buy tickets to upcoming events. I sign up for classes that interest me.

There are a lot of other events in your city. You can Google events and your citya nd  you'll find some. I’ll list a few here, for my location, New York. Feel free to add more in comments. I’m sure there’s a bunch more I’m missing. 

[Time Out](http://timeout.com/ )

[Artcal](http://www.artcat.com/) Gallery Opening listings in NYC

[Upright Citizens Brigade](http://www.ucbtheatre.com/) improv theater

[Secret Science Club](http://secretscienceclub.blogspot.com/)

This is just a sampling of some stuff I like to do. There are also classes (art, dance, cooking, sailing, scuba diving), volunteering, political groups, health (like yoga, hiking), sports (climbing, soccer, softball, basketball leagues), boardgame nights, trivia nights, festivals, burlesque, literary readings, theater, etc. 

**Go Alone**

This may be the most important piece of advice here. I don’t wait to ask someone before I buy tickets to events. I’ll invite friends to some, but many events I end up going to alone. By going to events alone, I can go to a new event every night of the week without worrying whether I have a wing or a chaperone. It gives me a lot of freedom. 

Planning to go to events alone is great because when that second date rolls around, you've already got something great to do and she can simply come along if she wants. You have a life that you can bring her into. That's so attractive.

You can also take more risks when you go alone. You may be hesitant to invite a friend out to an event if you're worried it's going to suck. But if you go alone, you can explore and find out what is good and what you really like.

**Simply Show Up**

Whenever you go out alone, there’s always that fear. What if people see me there without anyone, will I look like a loser? What if no one else is there and I feel weird? What if everyone else is there with friends but me?

For this I tell myself: Simply show up. Woody Allen once said, “Eighty per cent of success is simply showing up.” Simply get yourself to the event. Whatever you need to do to get yourself there, do it.  If the event totally sucks, you can pretend you got a phone call and walk out the door right away. At least you showed up. 

If possible, try to hang out for a bit after you get there. Sometimes you need to hang out for a bit to actually get a feel for if it's gonna be good. Walk around. Stand at the bar and have a drink. Pretend you’re waiting for your friends to show up. 

**Start Small**

If you have a lot of anxiety planning and going to events alone, start small. Find *one* new activity to do every week. Don’t put pressure on yourself to do something new every single night or you’ll burn yourself out.

**Focus on activities where there will be women**

Since meeting women is part of what this subreddit is about, you’ll want to foster interests that have a higher possibility of meeting women. Some activities are more geared toward meeting women than others. 

While it’s worth going to gaming conventions, star-trek conventions, and comic-book conventions if that’s what interests you, you may find a much lower number of women at these events then say yoga, art gallery openings, or theater events. If you’re looking for new interests, put your energy toward those that have a lot of women.

**Avoid Home**

As introverted guys, our home is our refuge. It's so easy to escape there. There are so many excuses to simply go home. After work, you're tired. There's no one to go out with. The event will probably suck. I probably won't meet anyone. etc. And once home, there is a lot of momentum to stay there. 

Avoid the tar pit of your home. Nothing happens there. Life happens when you walk out your front door. With a little consistency, planning, and bravery, pretty soon you'll have a more exciting life than you can imagine. And *that's* attractive!

1344279382.0,951,self.seduction,xs26d,7 things I discovered from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch,1213,262,129,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xs26d/7_things_i_discovered_from_abercrombie_fitch/,"I got a PM a few days ago from someone in r/seduction about my time working at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. 

...Overall I didn't make much, wasn't a huge fan of their clothing, and due to allergies was constantly plugged up due to the smell BUT it was a perfect training ground.

Part of the job, that's insinuated not told, is that flirting sells. This, of course, applies to all sales. Especially in clothing. These are some of the techniques I used then and that I still use today.

**1. Don't Be New** - This is something that I hear little about around r/seduction but has been incredibly effective for me.

...This involves seeing a girl, before she sees you, that strikes your interest. You walk by, I'd often do this carrying clothing or going off to fold, so that she sees you (but doesn't think that you've seen her).

You're now consciously (if she was checking you out) or subconsciously (you were in her gaze, but she wasn't checking you out) in her mind. Whether it's conscious or not doesn't matter. What does matter is that you are no longer completely foreign to her (whether she knows it or not). 

This will always make the girl you're interested in more comfortable when you begin to talk to her. This is very applicable on college campuses. If she has seen you, she'll feel more comfortable knowing you're not a complete stranger.

**2. Frame Her** - I was told this by my manager when I first began. When talking you want to engulf her frame of view without being in her face. 

...You do this by forming a V with your feet, with a wide stance. Ideally, if there's something by her (table, bar, chair, etc) you want to make it so that to the left there's something, to the front and right you're completely in the frame (by making the V), and the only open space is from behind.

This gives the perception of just talking but makes you the focal point. It also makes it tougher for people to disengage the conversation (since they have to either step back or walk backwards). 

This works well in all settings. Try doing this at work. Body language is not just how you control your body from the waist up, by standing upright, but also by how you frame conversations.

**3. Leave Early but Come Back Often** - By framing you're asserting an implied level of dominance. By leaving early you're showing that you're in control of the interactions.

...If you're at a house party and as soon as you see the conversation is dwindling eject. Go get yourself together, think of good topics, and then place yourself back in.

Ideally you want to recognize what the peak of your conversation would be (in terms of her interest in you and your conversation) and then eject. Not eject while the conversation itself is fading. 

With practice it becomes quite easy to tell when you're about to hit this peak. 

**4. Compliment What's She's Done, Not Her** - Between r/askwomen and r/seduction there's a bit of a discrepancy when it comes to randomly hitting on girls.

...r/Seduction normally goes with a general statement about her (i.e - I had to stop you because you're so cute) while r/askwomen always stress that they want to hear what they've done that makes them cute (i.e - I love your style, hair, whatever).

An employee first taught me this using the explanation that most women, like men, know their base attractiveness. They know that they're a 6, 7, or whatever. 

...Trying to tell them that they're a 9 based solely on ""looks"" most recognize is a thinly veiled attempt to get with them.

But telling them what makes them so attractive is something they are actively putting effort into (style, hair, even body) makes them (girls and guys I'd add) feel like they're reaching above that base attractiveness which is what everyone tries to do.

Of course, a reason we did this at Abercrombie is because everyone coming in was buying relatively expensive, usually revealing clothing. Buying into a very sex-driven atmosphere.

**5. Side Talk is the Best Talk** - We had to walk a fine line, especially since most employees were over 18 and our average cliental was in the 15-25 range.

Our stores always tried to convey an intimiate feel: dark rooms, soft lighting, loud but soothing music, and ""fragrance"" everywhere. 

But whispering in ears goes a little too far. So what many would utilize is side talk. It's when, due to how loud the room is or whatever, you lean to one side, slightly lean forward and talk.

This isn't intimiate, you aren't *really* getting much closer, but you're initiating a position related to intimacy. You may be making her more insecure by not speaking directly to her. And, if you're wearing cologne on your neck, she'll get a slight whiff of it perhaps (although that's redundant in our stores, I know). 

**6 - Your Eyes Say It All** - Eye contact is always a major factor. But I'll be a bit more specific. Again, advice from an older co-worker.

You *always* want to keep eye contact. You should initiate with eye contact and not break it until she looks away. Eye contact is always the first prelude to intimacy. 

BUT, even if you're the most attractive guy in the world, too much eye contact, especially in the wrong setting, can be a bit odd/creepy. 

So how do you break eye contact without breaking the intimacy that you've built up?

Don't look to the side! She'll think you're looking at someone behind her, or to her side.

Don't look down! It's a sign that you've lost interest, she makes you uncomfortable, or that you're shy (which isn't inherently a bad thing).

Look just slightly *above* her. This breaks the eye contact but nothing is implied by looking above her. Especially if you're taller this could just be you stretching your neck. But it does break the *feeling* of eye contact so you can reinitiate it. 

**7. The In and Out** - No, this is not about burgers. No, this is not about sex.

...This is something I first picked up from the movie Alfie (the new one, with Jude Law, great movie by the way if you haven't seen in) and shared with some friends/co-workers.

You should, in most settings, never crowd the individual your talking to unless it's at a party or club. You should be a good foot or so away, at least initially. 

When you're telling her a joke, or telling her a little secret, walk half-a-step towards her (still framing her), bend forward (if she's shorter than you) just a tad, and say your joke/secret/whatever and then step back smiling. 

This works *really* well with sarcasm. I'd normally say, ""Can I tell you a secret about this store?"" She'd say, ""Yes?"" and I'd lean in saying, ""We actually spray cologne in here all the time. It doesn't just naturally smell this way"" then I'd lean out. This would always get a ""Oh, *realllly* I never would've guessed"" type response. 

Breaking intimacy, like you break off conversations as discussed in point 3, is really effective. By saying you're telling her a secret and leaning in you're building intimacy, making her heart beat a bit quicker, and then quickly snapping it by telling a sarcastic joke instead of a true secret. 

**That's it...**

So that's it. Hopefully these help you out a bit. I still think about them and apply them whenever I'm out and about. Doesn't matter the setting.

1354223930.0,945,self.seduction,140j3l,[FR] Field Report: Coffee shop daytime approach parlayed into insta-date,1180,235,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/140j3l/fr_field_report_coffee_shop_daytime_approach/,"So this is my first field report. I'm going to try to point out important moments along the way instead of just narrating my experiences. I hope someone finds it useful.

The Scene: A new coffee shop that opened in my neighborhood. I'm a writer and have been going there to get work done (and look like the soulful, tortured author). If you haven't done a coffee shop approach, they're fucking brilliant because there is precisely zero competition and plenty of girls who are there unaccompanied. Get an espresso, jack up your inner game, and go for it.

Anyhow, I walk in and immediately spot a cute brunette with glasses who's dicking around on Facebook instead of reading her biology textbook. I take a seat at the table kitty-corner to her and ignore her. She looks up, I pay her no mind. I pull out my laptop and get busy. Out of my peripheral vision I see that she looks up at me every couple of minutes. I'm trying to convey that I've not noticed her and have better things to do.

On about the fourth time she looks up, I look up at the same time and make eye contact and smile. She quickly looks back down to her computer and pretends it's no big deal. I continue to look in her direction for a couple more seconds because I know she's now in socially-awkward penguin mode and will glance up involuntarily to see if the coast is clear. When she looks up I smile again and make my move. 

Me: ""Hi, excuse me. This is going to sound dumb. Are you trustworthy?""

Her: ""What do you mean?"" She makes a confused face.

Me: ""I mean, do your friends consider you someone they trust.""

Her: ""I guess?"" She looks a little apprehensive but not skeezed out, because she already feels weird about getting caught looking up at me.

Me: ""Well, I brought the wrong power cord for my laptop and need to go grab the right one. I live just around the corner (establishes that I'm a normal dude from the neighborhood) and it will take like two minutes. Can I trust you to watch my laptop and fend off any bad guys who come along?"" (Ben Franklin effect plus implied compliment that she looks trustworthy).

Her: ""Haha. Yeah, I think I could do that.""

Me: ""I'm taking a big chance here.""

Her: ""What, you keep your whole life on there or something?"" (Minor teasing, a good sign.)

Me: ""Yes, all of my dark secrets."" I start to walk away and then say, ""No peeking!""

I do indeed have another power cord at home and go retrieve it. When I come back, she's trying to look busy but notices me immediately when I enter and smiles.

Her: ""I only had to beat up, like, two dudes.""

Me: ""I so totally owe you. I'm J----."" I reach out to shake her hand. Initiate the kino in a non-threatening manner. 

Her: ""I'm K-----. And for the record, I didn't peek.""

Me: ""Your coffee is gone. Can I buy you a hot, caffeinated beverage as token of my gratitude? Or will that overstimulate you?"" (Subtly suggestive language, escalate the interaction by buying her something. I know classic PUA theory dictates I should tell her to buy me something and maintain my alpha-ness, but that's retarded). 

Her: ""I think I can handle it. How about a small skim latte?""

Me: ""Whoa, that's a little fancier than what you had before (it's clear she had black coffee). Is this your game? You seduce men so they'll buy you luxurious $3 lattes?"" (Introduce the idea of sex, flip the ""game"" around on her in a teasing way.)

Her: ""That's just the first step. I'm dangerous."" (Now I know I'm fucking golden. We've gone from bantering to sparring, and she's smiling a lot).

I go and get her latte and ask the barista to do the foam in the shape of a heart. When I return, I sit down at her table without asking and hand her the latte.

Me: ""You pretty much bankrupted me with this."" She notices the heart and I say, ""The barista must think we're cute together."" (Plant the idea of us as a couple - Inception mothafucka, do you speak it?)

Her: ""I'll bet she just has a thing for you."" (She subtly recognizes my value.)

I take her hand and look at her all super-serious and say, ""If she thinks she can win me away from you, she's fooling herself. Our love has stood the test of time for, like, a whole five minutes."" (Escalate the kino, further plant the idea of us a couple.) 

She laughs pretty hard at the joke and says, ""That bitch, she'll never take you from me."" She's got the look in her eyes now. Oh, it's beautiful.

We talk for about two hours, and I keep up with the idea of us being a couple. I say things like, ""So, we're getting pretty serious, but I'm not sure I'm ready to meet your parents,"" and, ""Darling, I can still remember the moment we met as if it were yesterday."" She eats it up.

I was having an awesome time, and was digging her more than most girls. I decided that I wanted to go for a #- and D-close instead of the F-close, which I firmly believe could have happened if I pressed my luck (after all, my apartment is just around the corner).

I finished by saying, ""I'm the one always doing the planning in this relationship. I think it's your turn to pick the date."" We exchanged numbers, I confirmed with the ""I'm going to text you naughty things"" maneuver (she laughed a LOT - thanks for that one, seddit), and right before I left I moved in totally nonchalant and planted a small kiss on her lips, as if I'd done it a hundred times before (we were pretty serious, after all). I smirked and said, ""See you soon, my love."" 

And then I walked out of there on a fucking cloud.

**UPDATE:** First, I'm so glad that some of y'all found my FR valuable. I got some really great orangereds and am pumped to see any followups from people who borrow the techniques that worked for me. 

Seddit, I'm still recovering from a weekend rife with intercourse, so I'll keep this update brief. It went so well, and took so little effort on my part, that I can't even call it a field report proper. 

She planned the date (as I told her to) and we went to a local bar for a playful, rather vanilla S&amp;M-themed party. I think it was her way of seeing how ""down"" I am with that lifestyle without freaking me out. I don't have a ton of experience with that sort of thing, but I'm very open-minded, and there were go-go dancers in leather so that's a plus. We dropped the whole ""we're a couple"" bit as an unspoken, as it seemed a little weird to carry it on. But the ""real"" chemistry was still there. Even amid all the peripheral sex of the bar we were in, we continued some excellent conversations we'd started in the coffee shop. She's a cognitive science PhD student and we had fantastic, geeky conversations about brains, minds, and computers. Even if we find out we're not compatible in the long term, I can tell she's someone I really want to have on my side. 

After we got a little buzz going, I invited her back to my apartment, ostensibly to ""make cookies."" Let's just say that I never even got to pre-heat the oven. We didn't go to sleep until 11:30 the next morning, and she stayed until...what time is it now? About two hours ago. Anyway, this is not a forum for bragging...but I'm still a little giddy so consider this my one little piece of braggadocio.

One of the commenters said that the above technique is great if you're looking for an LTR. I couldn't agree more. I enjoy casual sex, but find that the experience is much more intense and fulfilling with someone who I have an intellectual and emotional connection with. I've slept with three girls from daytime approaches now, and all of them turned into at least ongoing flings instead of one-and-dones.

For everyone who said ""this is too good to be true,"" as the person actually living it I'm inclined to agree. It's a bit surreal for me given how AFC I was a year ago. What you don't see with this FR is all of the times I struck the fuck out, all the crises of confidence, etc. There's a reason I didn't post an FR until this one - there weren't any that really seemed awesome enough to post.

As for whether it's exaggerated: No. This is exactly how it went down. I chalk it up to stumbling on someone with whom I have awesome chemistry -- after hundreds of approaches.

1374694265.0,939,self.seduction,1iz5l9,[FEMALE PERSPECTIVE] Signs that a girl will be receptive to approach,1214,275,216,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1iz5l9/female_perspective_signs_that_a_girl_will_be/,"So I thought I’d deviate a bit from my first two posts (^please ^don’t^hate^me). Instead of describing some approaches I’ve experienced, I’m going to describe some of the things my friends and I do when WE JUST OUT TO GET SOME DICK.

Ok this is a lie, my friends are all religious and don’t enthusiastically pursue the D, but they do at least want guys to kiss, want guys to take their numbers, and eventually want guys to confusedly navigate their virginities with on their (hopefully respective) wedding nights. If that’s what you’re into.  However, you’ll all be reassured (and ferociously aroused) to learn that I am not religious and so can offer at least some insight into the ‘desire for male genitalia’ node of the female brain.

**Things sneaky bitches do to sneak their way onto your penis**

* **Eyeball the club**

I know that most guys are not likely to make a move when I am in the middle of a four girl deep haggle, listening intently. So, if I’m receptive to being approached, I will **position myself on the outskirts of the group**, and **allow my eyes to wander the club** in the hope that someone fancy will catch them. Similarly, when dancing, I may take a bit more of my own space than the rest of the group, and will be a bit more erratic in my positioning (i.e. **not always facing towards the middle** of the dancing circle). Annoyingly, if you do make eye contact with me, I will almost certainly **panic wildly and look away.** I’m sorry, I’m just not built for this. *Phew. Ok. Look at him. He’s not fucking Medusa, you can do this*. The moral of the story here is, if a girl seems to dismiss your eye contact the first time, SHE MAY JUST BE A RAGING PUSSY LIKE ME. Look at her again a few seconds later:  **if she’s looking back, you may proceed to pound town.**

* **Separate ourselves from the herd**

Women do everything together, including void their bowels, so when you see a vulnerable wildebeest navigating its way through the savannah alone, **it’s unlikely to be an accident**. Of course, there are always exceptions: some women give few fucks about their gender’s norms and will pee when they bloody well need to and not when their girlfriends do, thank you very much. Other times, an unfortunate drunk girl will genuinely lose track of her friends. But I would always take this with a pinch of salt, because in the past I have actually **purposefully lost my friends in my valiant pursuit of the D**. It gives us an excuse to get approached and an excuse to approach ourselves (by enlisting the help of you lovely gentlemen). Which brings us on to…

* **Approach you for LITERALLY ANY BULLSHIT REASON WE CAN THINK OF**

‘Hey, do you have the time?/Dude where’s the smoking area?/Have you seen my friends?/Do you have a light?’

Sometimes, I will ask these questions purely because **I want an indirect opener**. I have a friend who uses the time one religiously, claiming it’s a conversation starter because *‘don’t nobody believe you have no other way of finding out the time than from a complete stranger! I mean shit girl, where your phone? Get it together!’.* I don’t smoke, but *I actually miss that some of my friends used to* because asking for a light is one of the easiest indirect openers there is. This has created an ongoing internal battle between the desire for easy openers and the desire for my friends to not develop cancer.

The important thing here is, if I ever actually do want to know where the smoking area is, I will ask either a) a woman or b) **a man I am attracted to**. I do this because I am aware that any approach I make has the potential to be misconstrued as a come-on. I would much rather approach a guy I wouldn’t mind thinking this.

* Similarly, most of you won’t need to be told this, but the same goes for **any approaches which are *more direct* than this**.  For instance: trying to steal your hat, saying she likes your dancing, asking for a sip of your drink. She is doing this for no reason other than she wants you inside her. In her vagina.

* **Get ‘accidentally’ all up in your business**

I’m not saying that every girl squeezing past you in a crowded club wants to spin on your dick. But the next time it happens, take a quick look around to see if there was a **clearer, more obvious path** she could have taken which didn’t involve her breasts squishing up against your back.

Finally, one last thing I have to tell you guys to look out for is **crafty underhand discussion about you, while you’re standing right there**. Say you’ve opened a 4 set in the smoking area. You’ve been there five minutes, as far as you can tell you’re getting along well. You all know that you can’t have all four of them (ok, you can, but you know what I mean), so at some point there is going to be some kind of interaction between the girls to decide their next move. They want to find out who’s interested, who’s enjoying talking but doesn’t want any more than that, and who’s not feeling it and just wants to go in and dance. A lot of the time, this will be done using facial expression, thumbs up/thumbs down signals, and nods or shakes of the head while you’re distracted. GIRLS ARE WILY FUCKERS. KEEP AN EYE ON THEM. 

This is such a pervasive problem that my friends and I eventually got sick of raising our eyebrows ambiguously at one another behind men’s backs and actually developed a code to use in such situations, which we have aptly titled ‘Where’s Sarah?’. Where’s Sarah goes thusly: at some point during the conversation, one girl will summon all her inner Hollywood and pipe up something along the lines of ‘Hey guys, where’s Sarah? I haven’t seen her in fucking ages’. We do not have a friend called Sarah. The other girls can then respond with one of several options:

* ‘I don’t know, do you want to go find her?’ **I.e. 'I want this guy'**

* ‘I don’t know, do you want us to go find her?’ **I.e. 'Do you want this guy?'** 

* ‘I don’t know, shall we go find her?’ **I.e. 'Can we please gtfo of here and acquire more shots?'**

I know. It’s almost entirely transparent. But please bear in mind that we have had ten vodka oranges and it is all we can do not to blurt out ‘ELIZA HE’S TOTALLY YOUR TYPE YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM’.

If you can catch on to the body language/codes the girls that you’re with are using, you can use this information to work out who you have the best chance with and calibrate accordingly.

Please read the whole thing before you judge.

Around here, it's taken almost as a given that men shouldn't take dating advice from women. The standard justification is ""if you wanna learn how to fish, you ask a fisherman, not a fish."" This is true, but the real reason goes deeper.

From a woman's point of view, when a guy asks, ""How do I attract women?"", this translates to ""How would a guy attract me?"". The answer to that question is obviously ""Be the kind of guy I'm attracted to."" So invariably the answer women give to the question is to become the kind of guy she's looking for. A woman will typically list a number of traits she finds appealing and tell the guy to acquire those traits. 

Or the advice may be confined to the much-maligned line ""be yourself"". When put into practice, this advice will actually end up turning *off* almost all women if you're not already a self-actualized person.

No woman is looking for some sort of chameleon who'll conform himself to whatever he thinks she wants. Such a man would be a puppy dog, and he wouldn't garner any respect from any woman. Women aren't attracted to guys they don't respect. But a lot of guys take dating advice from women and try to make themselves into the theoretical guys women say they're looking for, and end up becoming a chameleon.

The real answer to the question is to become the best version of yourself, and be the unique individual that you are. But being unique means expressing some qualities within yourself that not everyone is going to find attractive. You can't become a unique person without turning some people off. Different people are looking for different things. You can't please all the people all the time, as they say. So don't bother trying. You have to accept the fact that not everybody's going to be into you. 

What women really want is a guy who possesses all the qualities she's looking for *because he actually is the guy she's looking for*, not because he's pretending in order to impress her. 

So that's why it's a terrible idea to take dating advice from women. You don't want to make yourself into what she says she wants. That's working backwards. You want to make yourself into what *you* want to be, and then meet a lot of women and see which ones are looking for the unique individual you are.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_1aafq3,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1aafq3/on_why_you_should_never_take_dating_advice_from/,

So I started reading out loud news articles and anything that I could get my hands on with a pen in my mouth. I bite down on a pen across my teeth and then try and talk with the pen as an obstacle in my mouth. 

This forces my tongue to work harder and it makes be think a lot more about my pronunciation as a I talk. Practicing for a half hour a day has helped my talk so much better. Also, the talking warms your vocal cords, so when you go out and talk to women, you're voice is nice and projected because you've spent time already warming up.

Final tip. Try keeping your tongue at the base of your mouth behind your bottom teeth. This allows more air out and gives your voice an extra bit of boom. ",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_19ucae,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/19ucae/talking_with_a_pen_in_my_mouth_has_helped_me/,
1356443066.0,881,self.seduction,15f4n2,Where Guys Go Wrong when They Meet a Girl They Really Like,1199,318,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/15f4n2/where_guys_go_wrong_when_they_meet_a_girl_they/,"We've all tried to improve ourselves with women. At some point, you realize that what you're doing just isn't working. You're too tame, too friendly, too passive, and too nice. Too many opportunities are slipping through your fingers because you aren't making the move. So you learn new strategies that are edgier, bolder, and more sexual. You start to take risks with attractive women. You start to get better results. Women respond to your new boldness. Things are looking up.

But then it happens. You meet a girl you really like. And things seem different now. Even though she's not getting sexual with you, for some reason you decide it's okay to be a lot nicer and take things a lot slower sexually with her. Your brain comes up with brilliant reasons why it should be okay for you to do this:

* I want a wholesome, quality girl rather than a trashy girl. A quality girl will make a guy take it slow before she hooks up with him. 

* I want true love and a relationship instead of just sex. True love means that even though she isn't into me yet, I keep making an effort until I win her over.

* I didn't make it clear to her that I'm interested in her as a person rather than just interested in her sexually. I'll take her out on some respectable (sexless) dates to show her that I really like her.


* She's waiting for me to act more boyfriend-like before she gets sexual with me. I'll play the good guy for a while and she may get sexual with me later.

* She only dates guys she's friends with first. I'll just chill. I'll become friends with her and make the move later.

* She comes from a different culture where girls are more modest. I'll give her what she's used to, which is taking it slow sexually.

* She's shy and doesn't trust people easily. I'll win her trust and later she'll open up to me sexually.


The underlying idea is this:

* *I've found a great girl. I'm going to try to invest emotionally with her and let her invest emotionally with me. I'll leave the sex for later, until she's emotionally invested in me. Then I'll get her for sure.*

There are two big problems with this strategy. 

**First, you become too emotional to get sexual.** The longer you hang out with her `as a friend,' the more emotionally invested you become. You start to have more and more feelings for her beyond friendship. As you spend weeks/months/years getting closer to this girl without getting sexual, your emotional investment makes you careful and inhibited around her because you don't want to lose what you have with her. So it becomes almost impossible to make the move to get sexual later. 

**Second, she starts to lose attraction for you.** The more emotionally invested you get in her without her commensurate sexual investment, the more she loses attraction for you. She reads your unwillingness to get sexual as a lack of self-confidence on your part. She sees this as you not having enough confidence in your own sexual attractiveness to bring the relationship to a sexual place. Your deliberate, careful, sex-free demeanor bores her. 

Instead of letting this girl off the hook in terms of sexual investment, it is critical that you get her sexually invested in the relationship sooner rather than later. 

Sexual investment doesn't just mean sex. It could mean sexual banter. It could mean physical contact. But whatever it is, it leads to sex. It's a small sexual investment on her part which calls for a small emotional investment on your part. 

If she is unwilling to get sexual with you early on, then you should not be willing to invest emotionally in this girl. Sure, you could be friends with her if that's honestly what you want. But honestly, is that really what you want? It isn't. Don't try to be friends with her if you are interested in her sexually. That will just lead to problems for you. 

Typically, if you inject sex early on and she isn't into it, she'll filter herself out. Often she'll drop the conversation or stop talking with you. She may act offended or `creeped out.' That's fine. That's what you want. You want to find out if there's any attraction for you early on instead of wasting hours/days/weeks/months on this girl only to find she isn't into you.

When you meet a girl you really like, don't change your game for her. Don't slow down. She doesn't get a free pass just because you like her. No matter how nice and wholesome she seems, she will be willing to invest something sexually if she likes you. And if she isn't willing, it's not worth the investment on your part, no matter how great she seems.

Shameless self-plug: If you aren't meeting women you really like, it's time to learn how. My new program, [She's Six Steps Away](http://shessixstepsaway.com), teaches you everything you need to know to get past your fear of approaching women.

Here is my story",1277,402,421,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/15rsrf/im_a_shy_awkward_average_looking_guy_who_has/,"When I was 20 years old I hadn't even kissed a girl.  I was (and still am, in a way) terrified of women.   After finally losing my virginity during the summer of 2006 things slowly started to get better.  I was in a couple of long-term relationships over the following years where I only slept with 3 women.  I've now been single for 4 years and have slept with around 50 women.  50 might not seem like a lot to some guys on here, but if someone had told me when I was 20 that I would sleep with more than 5 women I would have laughed in their face.  

As I said, I'm by no means handsome.  I've actually never had a girl tell me that I'm hot or handsome.  The best praise I've received is being told I was cute, which we all know isn't a compliment.  I'm 5'11, scrawny (145 pounds), have no major hobbies or interests.  I've had people ask me if I'm still a virgin because I come off as being so shy. 

To start, I just want to say to virgins out there that once you finally get laid it will feel as if you've finally been unchained.  I was convinced at one point that I was going to die a virgin.

Here are some things that have worked well for ***me***.  Keep in mind that I don't really follow a lot of the key ""rules"" here on seddit (not that I think they don't work, I just do things a little differently).

* When I meet a girl I like I try to change contact information with her as quickly as possible.  If you let her go home without getting her number, you're gonna have a bad time.

* I joke around **a lot** with girls that I'm interested in.  It's usually to the point where they tell me I joke **too** much and they don't know when I'm being serious or not.  I like to use a lot of sarcasm and make fun of myself and the girl I'm going after.  I honestly think this is the main reason I get laid.
* I'm a huge loner and hate being in large groups.  So when I meet a girl for the first time I'm almost always by myself.  Subsequent dates will always be 1 on 1.  There are a few restaurants where I'm a regular so I sit at the counter and am friends with all of the staff.  This is where I meet most of my hook-ups.
* I always ask them loads of questions about their personal life but I **never** bring up sex.  When they ask me questions about myself I try to keep the answers as short as possible.
* I very **rarely** use kino when I first meet them.  The most kino I'll do is a handshake.  I'll only start to use kino when I have them back at my apartment, or if we're both drunk.
* When I meet them again for our first ""date"" I **always meet at night and keep it short and fun**.  Usually I'll take them to play pool or billiards, share a few beers, then tell them I have to head back home.  They almost always seem surprised that I'm going back so early.
* For the next meet up I make it a goal to bring her back to my place (at night) to watch a movie.  I haven't cooked dinner for a girl during a date in over 3 years!
* During the movie is when I go heavy on the kino, usually I'll start with my hand on her leg and progress from there (rubbing her inner thigh, wrists, hands). 
* **If a girl flakes on me twice, I'm done with her**.  I move on and cut my losses.  If a girl takes several days to respond to a message and just shows no interest, I move on.
* Having a good guy friend to go out with who is really laid back and easygoing is a godsend.  I said before that I almost always go solo, but the times that I'm able to go out with my friend my odds of meeting someone increase quite a bit.   Bonus points if your friend can make people laugh
* **I treat all the girls that I meet with respect, even after I've slept with them**.  I would say that I still keep in touch in some way with 30 or more of the girls I've slept with.  They are still friends and there are no hard feelings between us.


I don't know if this will help any of you, but I hope in some way it does.  Sometimes I read posts on here about guys who immediately initiate kino within moments of meeting women and it blows my mind.  I would never be able to do that, simply because I'm way too reserved/shy when I first meet a girl.   I go about things my own way and have had fairly good success. 

So that brings an end to my rambling.   To the virgins out there- keep your heads up and don't give up hope!

To be honest I was a bit apprehensive posting as a female, but as it turns out you guys were total babes to me, and as I'm currently out of uni for summer I plan to continue making posts until you track me down and beat me to death in a strangled fit of rage. And on that note, onwards we go:

**Approach 1: The average guy who got it right (K-close)**

This approach happened within literally two minutes of entering the club: I was **totally sober**, and hadn’t even checked my coat. HG6 pulls [The Claw] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuKWH8x7_oM) on me as my friends and I are walking by, and I turn back to look at him quizzically. I love The Claw as a really quick way to gauge interest. An attractive woman walking through a nightclub will have several guys try to grab her and pull her into their bubble. After a while, this shit can get inefficient, so **if a girl is not receptive she will simply not look back**. A girl who looks back (and does not look fucking pissed) can be assumed to be at least a little receptive to what you’re going to do next, so make it good. 

HG6 smiled. He was taller than me and stepped towards me to emphasise this, before exclaiming ‘Hi! Who are you?’. This guy was clearly going for high energy, so I decided to see if he liked being spun as much as bitches do. I yelled ‘Hi!’, grabbed his hand, and managed to twirl him (after navigating some understandable confusion on his part). Importantly, the guy took this unusual turn of events completely in his stride, didn’t act uncomfortable with the effeminate nature of the move **(to be alpha is to not care if you look alpha)**, and proceeded to lift me up and spin me round a few times. This could have been alarming to do on a random girl, but, based on my behaviour, he did some **successful calibration** and knew it would work fine. He put me down but **let his arms stay around my waist** like it was the most natural thing in the world, and we talked. Some things I remember from the interaction:

* K: (in feeble protest) ‘I only just got here! I literally walked in the door two minutes ago!’

HG6: ‘Wow, you must be so glad you found me already. I admire your efficiency, you know.’

**Frame change**: I am now the one chasing him. 


* K: ‘You are one super hairy man.’

HG6: ‘The doctors tell me that without this I would essentially be a dolphin.’

Thinking about it, this is a pretty weird and nonsensical joke, but it was a quick response to an unexpected comment and to be honest, I laughed. Just goes to show that **it doesn’t matter what you say if you say it with ample balls.**


* Throughout the interaction I was protesting that a) I was sober and b) my friends were waiting for me. HG6 was able to distinguish these **superficial anti-slut defences** from legitimate excuses and calibrate his responses accordingly. He teased me for the sober thing (‘Oh man, you’re not one of those girls who can only be adventurous when she’s got a few vodkas in her, are you? Girl, I thought you were different…’), which prompted me to want to **qualify myself** because no girl wants to be the boring lame one. As for my friends, all he actually had to do here was point out that they were already out of sight (strike one for the sisterhood), but had they still been hanging around a simple **‘do you mind if I borrow your friend for a second?’** would have worked wonders for their and my own comfort levels. The K-close was natural after this as he was already basically embracing me and had been for almost the entire interaction.

As a side note, this same guy apparently tried it on with my friend ten minutes later, and their interaction went something like this:

‘You made out with my friend like ten minutes ago...’

‘Oh yeah? The one with the pink dress?’

‘Yep.’

‘No way! You’re so funny, let’s dance!’

This guy has balls the size of watermelons and is living the dream.

**Approach 2: The attractive guy who got it wrong**

HG8 was tall, with wavy brown hair, blue eyes and cheekbones like a motherfucker. He did not close. This was an approach I witnessed my friend experience, and which I was eventually forced to intervene in because it got just that bad. Now, I am not the Mother Hen type; I will abandon ship on my girls left right and centre when they need some alone time with a potential suitor. But this guy’s game was so bad my friend requested urgent rescue.

The initial approach was not bad: he came up to our group with an **indirect opener** about how to get outside (we were on a boat).We had no idea, and he quickly struck up an alternative conversation about party boats in general, if this was our first time on one, etc. Throughout this interaction he seemed awkward and on edge. There was no attempt at kino or even any kind of playful conversation: he was in **nice guy interview mode** and we were neither challenged nor engaged. After five minutes or so, we explained that we were going to go and dance and he followed us upstairs. **We danced. He did not.** After about 30 seconds of awkward standing, he approached me and began to ask me more interview questions, before asking to be introduced to my friends. Relieved of my escape, I introduced him to the rest of the girls and continued to dance. He decided on his target (let’s call her C) isolated her a little way off from the group, and continued to interview her for about fifteen minutes. After ten minutes, C started to pull the international signal for distress behind the guy’s back, but we ignored her because this is funny. After a few more minutes though, it was getting ridiculous, and I approached HG8 to explain that at the moment we just wanted to dance, and perhaps we would see him downstairs later. He nodded but then tried to continue.  I prompted C to reiterate the message, and she did…but still he hung around her for the next hour, a **strange static figure on the outskirts of our dancing group**, trying to engage her in conversation at every opportunity. Several times throughout the hour, we all tried to encourage him to dance with us, but he declined. When he tried to interview C, we rushed over to clamp our hands over his mouth, but still he persisted. Eventually he slunk away, but we would still see him lingering nearby and staring at C with alarming intensity at various points throughout the night.

This guy was suffering from a fairly extreme case of **failure to calibrate to his environment**. The venue at was an Ibiza reunion party boat, for God’s sake, and he was trying to run verbal day game (and not very good game, at that). If the girl is high energy in a high energy environment, she don’t want no low energy shit from you! Bitch want to be SPUN AND SHIT.* This is incredibly important for night game and is something that Tyler describes perfectly in [this video] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd3Rs9FxguA) at 2:30. 

**Typical mistakes of guys with zero game** 

This is stuff a lot of you guys already know, but I was asked by a few people to expand a bit on the things that never work. SO:

* *Physical persistence to the point of inciting terror.*

So you use The Claw on me, great, but I am shaking my head and attempting to disentangle myself from you. As you continue to paw at me, protesting ‘hey hey wait a second, you don’t have to run away, just talk to me for a second, ok?’ you ignore my steadily increasing expression of panic. As a rule, if the fight to keep my attention has become a battle of strengths, IT HAS GONE TOO FAR. We are now just duelling. Please let me go.

* *Orbiting. You ain’t satellites, yo.*
 
We see you watching us from the sidelines of the dancefloor. We see you accidentally dancing ever closer to us as the song goes on, and we know that you are not having any of your own fun. You are trying to take ours. You are not projecting value, you are not acting for your own amusement, right now you are purely here to stalk us, and that is not at all attractive…so don’t be that guy. Be the social hub, surrounded by people, making his own damn fun, and make us feel lucky to even get a smile thrown our way.

* *Buying girls you don’t know drinks*

Either you’re trying to buy my attention, or get me slaughtered enough to want to give it. Neither of these gives me the downstairs tinglies.

* *Insistence on dancefloor approach despite complete unwillingness to dance*
 
If you absolutely refuse to dance, that’s fine, but please stick to the quieter areas of the club and stay out of my flailing way, LEST I STRIKE YOU.

Aaand that’s all I can think of for now. Hope you guys found something of use in here! :)

1345985019.0,856,self.seduction,yumve,"Stop seeking her approval, and you will notice a drastic change in how women will relate to you.",1102,246,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yumve/stop_seeking_her_approval_and_you_will_notice_a/,"This lesson has not only improved my relationships with other women, but has also taught me to act with conviction in all that I do. I learned this lesson through one experience in particular that I wanted to share with the community.

It was a week before my 18th birthday and I remember wanting nothing more than to spend the day with 'L'. She was a wonderful girl that I had been seeing for the past two months. We had amazing chemistry and things had really heated up after we went to prom together.

Looking to keep the momentum, I was eager to spend my 18th with her and ask her to be my girlfriend shortly afterwards. We were talking about my birthday via text and this is what followed:

* Her: What are you doing for your birthday?

* Me: As long as you're there, it really doesn't matter :) What do you want to do?

* Her: I don't really know...I'm not sure if I'm free on your actual birthday either, sorry

* Me: That's totally fine, I can just do something with my family and set aside a date that works better for you. 
What days are you free next week?

* Her: Not too sure yet, but I'll get back to you once I get my dance schedule

* Me: Ok, sounds good! Let me know!

Later in the week, we agreed to meet up the day after my birthday. That day, she flakes on me, claiming that she read her schedule wrong and had dance class the whole afternoon. I was obviously distraught. Awkwardness ensued and we never spoke a word to each other again.

I spent the rest of that summer frustrated, trying to make sense of how she had left so suddenly. I thought of the following reasons:

1. Maybe she's seeing another guy.

2. She's been really involved in dance lately and that's her priority right now.

3. She probably just isn't into celebrating birthdays. She was never enthusiastic when I tried to plan with her.

4. There must be an issue in her family/friends/personal life that made her cancel on me last minute.

5. Maybe it's that time of month?

**Never did I consider that the reason she didn't spend my 18th birthday with me was the fact that I had effectively cut off my balls during the 'planning process', leaving her disgusted that she was involved with a sorry excuse for a man.**

My problem with L was that I constantly sought her approval for all that I did and worse, refused to believe I did until she was long gone. Looking back, if I had simply said:

* Her: What are you doing for your birthday?

* Me: Heading out to SixFlags. I'm getting a group together this week. You in?

I guarantee that she would cancel whatever dance class she had on my actual birthday and we'd have a blast.

So, what did I learn? The key difference between what I said five years ago and what I would have said to her today is that now, **I speak with conviction.** I say exactly what I want and make it clear how I'm going to make it happen. 

I'm going to keep this mentality regardless of the outcome I get. What if she really couldn't come along that day? Who cares. I'm going to grab 3-4 friends and enjoy my birthday. Sounds much better than what I actually did: Moping around at home wondering what I could have possibly done wrong.

I'll never have that one back but I've come to terms with it and derived an important life lesson. I don't need the approval of others to get what I want. 

Women have a sixth sense for assessing a man's conviction and how badly he needs to feel validated. L did a good job of running for the hills as soon as she realized that I didn't know how to live for myself. I've found that women are willing to compromise on many fronts-even looks, money, and social status, but will not tolerate a man living only to appease her.

I hope you enjoyed this story-it was definitely long but I think clearly illustrates what every man needs to do. Decide what you want, move toward it unashamed, and don't depend on anybody else's approval but your own. And if things don't happen the way you planned, learn from any mistakes and move on. I sure did and for that I am the most grateful.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1345987051.0,,,True,t3_yumve,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yumve/stop_seeking_her_approval_and_you_will_notice_a/,

My girl and I talk about what attracts people and why people do things. She told me some things and noticed that some things were clicking finally. So I thought I would share some things.

Notes:

* **Girls don't get romantically involved with safe guys who are not exciting to them.** (classic nice guy syndrome)

* **Confidence is not about being right but assuming you are until otherwise proven. Don't second guess yourself unless you absolutely should.** Don't be a douche about it. If someone can prove you wrong then admit fault and go on about your business, it isn't the end of the world to be wrong, it can be quite refreshing. You don't always have to prove yourself either. It isn't nessesary to always prove yourself right. State what you need to and listen to the opposition. If the concept they are stating is wrong and it isn't a huge deal then let it go, or at least don't argue for a long time because it doesn't matter. Being confident doesn't mean be arrogant, because arrogance means you are not confident in yourself enough to admit fault. **Don't be a douche, be confident.** [further explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/s3kgi/quicktips_i_find_important/c4au9st)

* Women **don't** want a guy who is always agreeing with her. She likes to be teased. Not insulted. Fake insults are teasing.

* Women want a guy with wit, not rehearsed jokes. Although once in a while a decent canned joke is ok.

* Being likeable does not mean the same thing as exciting or cute.

* When you are drunk you are saying and doing things you want to say or do. Have the confidence to say and do those things when you are sober.

* When girls say let's just be friends, they are not really asking to be your friend most of the time. This is their way of saying goodbye. I honestly enjoy having female friends but when they say it, it generally doesn't really mean they want to be friends.

* Most females that want to be your friend genuinely are actually secretly interested in you. The other small percentage that genuinely want to be just friends are actual confident women who just enjoy the companionship.

The thing is, you got to be interesting. Find things you like to do, talk about, events, etc. Also need to tease more. Women love to be teased. They love the roller coaster of emotion between a real conversation and some teasing mixed in. They don't want all teasing and they don't want all serious. Got to mix that shit up. They are real people. You love to tease and joke with your friends but women you get a bonus feature. You get to be more intimate with the jokes and conversations. This is what makes them want to jump you. Be careful because when you get good at it you are not going to be able to get the women to leave you alone. It's sorta funny after a while. But for now you don't got to worry about it. Move forward till you see that you have mastered this shit.

Become more fun.

---

**Until you have repeat success with women you don't want a gf.** This means just date a lot of people. Dating is just a series of dates. Dates are just things you do with a person you could possibly be attracted to. Date / dating are just words that give a weird connotation to things. Stop worrying about it.

**You want to be good with women before you settle down.** If you don't you are going to suck ass with your gf and eventually you will get married and she will then later get bored and angry with you and leave you for a fun exciting man. It doesn't matter if you are stable. **Women need excitement.** You would be bored as shit if your woman was stable but boring as fuck.

---

**Most people do not give themselves permission to be themselves.**

I have a few guy friends who aren't good with women because they don't give themselves permission to be awesome around women and they think they have to do certain things. Tweak, maybe. Act completely different, no. Women like real men. Not fake ones.

A few tricks to get your brain to say you can do things:

* Assume she is already into you. Honestly if she is on a date with you, you already have done well and she is already interested to know you better. She wants to know you, not some made up persona.

* Think as if you are not allowed to game the girl because you already have one. This enables you to be who you are and not care if she is into you or not in which gives you the supreme ability to do whatever the fuck you want. This is a damn good reason guys who are married or are dating women get more attention. The persona they show is who they really are.

* Realise you get to live once and when that chance is gone you are dead. This should enable you to enjoy life and what it allows you to do. Life is the ultimate sandbox game. You get to do whatever it is you want and it is set on the hardest level possible. Rock that shit. Good chance you won't die from a conversation with your date.

When I go out dancing and playing pool I wear super silly hats. This tells my brain that everyone already now knows I am a goofy fucker. I no longer have to try and hide that because my cover is blown. I then get to act as I want without recourse because I can only go up from there.

---

* Don't worry if people don't agree with you if you know they are just being incredibly sensitive. You can't always have people agree with you. Just make sure  you do your best at being an awesome person for yourself. You can't win them all.

* If she is a little upset and not wildly upset, let her get over it. You don't have to get in on every single emotion she has. That just creates problems. 

* If your woman is upset and you know you didn't do anything you can usually cheer her up by telling her you care, giving her a hug, making funny faces at her, changing the subject all together to something she must dwell on in order to properly converse. **Transfer the energy from her shitty thoughts to good thoughts.**

* You can never be sure if someone gives a shit. You can only be sure of what you feel in that moment and yourself. Stop worrying so much about what people think of you because that only makes it worse.

* If they cheat you probably should move on. That doesn't mean you can't be nice to the person. Everyone has their own issues. You may forgive, but not forget. (I love my ex but I will never trust her with a relationship again. That doesn't mean I don't wanna be her friend while honoring and loving my current partner.)

* When a girl says something fucked up and you know if you answer the question logicaly in which you should never have been asked, you need to just be silly or not answer. Shit tests are easy to pass. Some people worry about the wierdest shit and that is why they ask or say some of those dumb things. Don't play into it because you can't win. Change the context from serious to silly because those irrational things are fucking hilarious.

* The power of the word ""no"" is fucking amazing. You really can't answer the word no. So if someone says a bunch of things and they are looking for an arguement and their entire arguement is just one giant shit-test kind of thing, the answer ""no"" is amazingly powerful. Concise, simple, and delivers the hand of God to their face. You then can move on from there to other topics of conversation or just walk away.

* Women will please you much more than they expect to be pleased. This may become frusterating. Don't worry about it. The balance is a bit odd with this. (My woman does amazingly huge amounts of things for me and yet I can't think of enough things to do in order to express my appreciation to her for them. So I just be kind and awesome for her. That seems to work.)  Do not get tons and tons of gifts. It will become expected. You do not want that.

* **We are to become the best version of ourselves, not someone else. First you must start by revealing the version of yourself you actually are and then work on that.**

* You may think you are an introvert. Try to be extroverted for a period of time. You may feel physically exhausted. If that ends up being the case after a few months of trying to be extroverted you probably are physically introverted. This is OK. Alpha is about mindset, not nessesarily the length of time you can be exuberant in energy. **Introverts &amp; Extroverts are equally capable of being Alpha.**

* Being nice doesn't mean you are exciting. Women need excitement. Even the nice girls.

* Being Alpha doesn't mean being douche.

&gt; Speaking of douche... my woman calls me a douche or douchebag sometimes as a tease. She doesn't mean it but it is hilarious. You can make so many funny comments out of it. 

&gt; * Douche. ""Wheres my bag?"" You don't get a bag.

&gt; * Douche. ""You asking me to clean out your dirty vag?"" lololol / hug / kiss

&gt; * Douchebag. ""bigga-bagga-douches (sounds itallian haha)""

&gt; Have fun, don't take shit too serious. Life is fun as hell.

* Everyone has a different background, so don't worry if they don't match you.

* Everyone has a battle. Don't freak out on people so much.

* The golden rule states that you should act unto others as they act unto you. It doesn't state that they will recipricate. Don't count on it or you will be sorely mistaken.

* **Do not dwell on the ideal outcome of the situation**, dwell on the moment and enjoy it for what it is and look at the situations as they come and go down paths you enjoy. If you wanna fuck the girl and it comes up then great you can stear it that way subtley but don't make it your priority. Make your first priority to enjoy yourself. Make the outcome of fucking the girl an optional goal, not the primary goal. **Be outcome independant. Be in the moment, not the future ideal.**

Things you can do when you're *not* out in the field in order to make your life in the field, well, easier. Please feel free to chime in and add anything you'd like to this list. If it gets big enough and doesn't suck, perhaps we can get it on the side bar. So here are a few things I've learned over the years... 

**Bedroom**

* Cleanliness is next to godliness. Keep your place *clean*. I don't mean it has to pass the white glove test at all times, but shit, keep it in order guys. For me, it's always better to go to *her* house when it's time to get down to business, but we all know that's not always possible. A nice looking pad goes a long way in getting you to your goal. 

* Your bed is important. Invest in it. I've had many, many women ring me up and ask to stay the night at my house because my bed is ""so much more comfortable."" A bullshit excuse to get in my bed, but not one I'm complaining about. High thread count sheets, a decent looking bed frame, and an incredibly comfortable mattress make a world of difference. Besides, you spend a third of your life on that thing, don't skimp. 

     - To go along with this, pillows are important. You should have at least four of them, with matching pillow cases. And for fucks sake make sure they aren't old as all hell. I have two firm one and two soft and fluffy ones so no matter what, if she stays the night, she's comfortable.   

* On a related note, *make your bed before you go out for the evening.* Honestly, I generally don't make mine because I'm kind of a lazy fuck, but every time I go out, I do. When you bring someone home, every little thing helps. 

* Have an extra pair of gym shorts handy. This is what I typically sleep in because they're damn comfortable. Some women like to sleep naked. Some like to sleep in just their underwear, and some will ask you for something. Every girl I've ever tossed a pair two has told me they're going to steal them because they're incredibly comfortable to sleep in. Plus, sometimes girls just look insanely cute in guy's clothing. 

* From a comment below: Candles are awesome. Look nice, and more importantly, they make shit smell nice. Always a good thing. Vanilla and sandalwood scents are my jam. Reasonably masculine but not overpowering. Don't, however, keep them right next to your bed. Take it from me, if things get crazy, a spilled candle and a small fire can be a mood killer. 

* Get a dimmer switch for your light. Some girls like to see everything. Some like it pitch black. In my experience, a little dim mood lighting is usually perfect. 

**Bathroom**

* I don't let any girl leave things at my house for obvious reasons. However, this can cause a few problems for women. As such, there are a few things I keep around for their benefit (mostly). 

     - Toothbrushes. I buy a bulk pack of cheap soft bristled ones for girls that stay over, *and* to clean my shoes with. The latter reason is what I tell them they're there for so I don't come off as a total scumbag. It's also truthful. 

     - Wet wipes. Two reasons: Again, any girl will appreciate them when it's time to clean up. Also, goddamn they're amazing when *you* have just taken a post-chipotle deuce and things are a bit gritty down there. Trust me.

     - Saline solution. I wear contacts. So do many women. They'll appreciate it if you've got it. Don't wear contacts? Shut up and buy some anyway, with a little case to hold contacts. If you're asked why you have it, it's because a friend from out of town stayed with you and left it there on accident.  

     - Hair dryer was listed below by puaCurveBall. I'm not generally one to let a girl shower at my place, but I can certainly see where it'd be useful. Along with this, a comb or brush would be good to have as well. 

     - Clean, nice, soft fluffy towels. I figured this should go without saying but enough people have mentioned it to merit it being here. Make sure you've got both bath-sized towels and a few wash cloth sized ones as well

     - As I mentioned in a reply below, a bar of Dove unscented soap in the bathroom. Gentle enough for almost any skin type, always good to have around for her to wash up with, regardless of what you use.

* In my bathroom I have a small decorative little jar type thing. It's filled with little sample sized packets of advil/aleve/aspirin/whatever. Always good for helping quell a hangover the next morning, both for yourself, and your friend. Bonus points: since it's just sitting out there in the open, and chances are pretty damn high that she'll use your bathroom at some point, she can help herself to them. 

**Logistics**

* Condoms and lube: keep that shit near by. I have a night stand with a drawer on it. Guess where those goodies go? When it's time to get busy, it helps expedite the process and make things less awkward. Before I had that night stand I kept them in a small watch box underneath my bed close to the head board so they'd be easy to get to in the dark. 

     - In addition, it's never a bad idea to keep non-latex condoms around for a girl who may have allergies to latex. 

     - Going out for the night and want to have some condoms and lube handy but aren't sure how to carry them? Best way I've found: Get some [trial sized lube samples](http://www.cheaplubes.com/liquidsilk10ml-foilsample.aspx) in the little foil packets. You can easily fit that, and a couple of condoms in a [business card holder like this one](http://www.amazon.com/Business-Card-Case-Cross-Silver/dp/B002VVKZ8S/ref=sr_1_6?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327480770&amp;sr=1-6). Easy to keep in an inside jacket pocket, or the back pocket of your pants. Looks reasonably classy, and not as goofy as keeping that stuff in your wallet, which you're probably going to be bringing out a few times over the course of an evening. 

* Water. After a good romp, your lady friend and you will need to hydrate. I keep a case of cheap bottled water in my closet for easy access (and to avoid awkward 4am naked run-ins with the roommate). 

* Music. Seems silly, but most people seem to like good tunes to get naked to. I have a few select Pandora stations that I'll pop on that I've spent enough time clicking the like and dislike buttons for certain tracks with that they never let me down. My go-to's? Zero 7, Massive Attack, Pretty Lights, etc. (I've got Pandora One so I don't get ads. Kinda funny when you're going at it and all of a sudden you're getting sold car insurance, though.)

     - Additions from others: instrumental hip hop, The Weekend, The XX. Not going to keep going with this because music tends to be a very personal thing, but you get the idea. 

* Taxi drivers: know one, and know one well. I'm a chatty motherfucker, so every time I get in to a cab, I talk like crazy and get friendly with the driver. As such, I've got the personal cell numbers of a guy that ""forgets"" to start his meter until halfway through the drive for me, and another that will let you choose a song from a list and sing it to you on your way home. Always entertaining. 

* Even if you don't smoke, it's not a bad idea to carry a lighter. You never know when some lovely lass is going to ask you for a light. It's like you don't even have to try to open in that case. 

**Kitchen**

* As Trooper below said, have a bottle of wine handy. Or go one further like I do and have a decently stocked bar.You never know what her drink of choice may be. Here's a break down of what I find to be the essentials. And don't get the cheap stuff either. You don't have to buy all top shelf booze, but a plastic handle of vodka screams ""college, broke, and doesn't know any better.""

     - Vodka, gin, whiskey, rum, tequila, and both type of vermouth (dry and sweet) should always be around, as well as a bottle of red wine (someone mentioned shiraz although I'd go with a merlot), and a bottle of white (my call is for pinot grigio on this one as well). 

     - Mixers, you'll need them. Vodka and crystal light don't go together well. Soda water, tonic, coke, diet coke, cranberry juice, OJ, margarita mix, and maybe some redbull. Get the coke in cans, and the tonic/soda water in the small bottles, instead of a large 2 liter, so they last longer (being carbonated and all)

     - Learn how to make a few basic cocktails if you don't already know how. Margaritas, greyhound, sea breeze, martini, etc. A shaker isn't a bad thing to have around either.  

* Keep some easy to make snacks handy. If you're going to be cooking a dinner, you'll be prepared for it I'd hope. But if you stumble home with some lucky lady at 3AM and have the munchies, save yourself some money, and time, and get your grub on at home. Cheese and crackers, and little microwaveable things from Trader Joe's tend to work well for me. 

     - As puaCurveball suggested, Luna bars/granola type bars are also damn handy to have around. 

**Car**

* Are you driving? As karlbarx noted, keep your car clean. You don't want your date to step in to a veritable rolling trash can. Something I forgot to mention because I now live in a public transport friendly city.

     - When I used to drive every bloody day, I'd also keep a nice cozy warm blanket and a pillow in my car. You never know when they'll come in handy. 

     - I also kept $20-$40 in cash in the glove box for those situations where I happened to be without cash, not have an ATM near by, and whatever venue I was at didn't take plastic. 

* Per sithyiscool's suggestion, keep a go-bag, of sorts, in your ride, with a decent looking change of clothing in it. A few toiletries (mouth wash, hair product, etc.) probably wouldn't hurt either. 

* A spare phone battery and a car charger are always incredibly useful. 

* Tide-to-go stain sticks are amazing. Get them and keep one in the car.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_ovn0w,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ovn0w/life_hackspro_tipsbro_tips/,

It was brilliant. ,1061,240,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/q2awy/over_heard_a_guy_say_this_today_while_he_was_on/,"This guy changed a fundamental aspect of a common conversation exchange forever.  He didn't even know it.  This dude walked by while on the phone (could have been with his mom I have now idea) and said ""Why was it good. No, I'm asking **why** was your day good...""  I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE! I've always asked ""hows your day going"".. I then get the typical ""oh it's good"" then get stuck.  What an amazing way to really get them to think about what they just said, and give you talking points.  You can then use conversation threading (something I've picked up on here) to take that one thing that made their day ""good"" and expand off of it.  Perfect opener, I love it.  It could even be used at a bar/club: ""hows your night going""? I guarantee you'll get the ""pretty good"" or ""good"".  Then ask **why**.  It's actually a pretty deep psychological question if you think about it.  It makes them assess their current situation and maybe they're not ""good"" but having a downright shitty time.  This could be an opportunity for them to vent. 
Anyway, maybe I just had too much caffeine today.  I just thought I overheard a stroke of genius and thought I'd share/see what you guys thought.

1364365987.0,811,self.seduction,1b3j0h,[FR] Women want what other women want.,993,182,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1b3j0h/fr_women_want_what_other_women_want/,"I've been reading seddit for a few months now and thought I should share something.

I, like so many others on here, have been extremely frustrated with my sex life. I'm 23 yrs old and after the recent ending of a 4 year relationship, I was kind of a boring and socially awkward horny dude with no friends. Thats all changing.

About six months ago I really started doing things to improve myself, and that is the most important thing in my life right now. I picked up guitar; have been coding my ass off (accepted that I am a computer nerd at heart, and will now proudly proffess this to any woman who asks what I do); moved in with a bunch of randoms to improve my social skills; lost 20 lbs; the list goes on.

Up until about a month ago I was still struggling to approach women until one awesome weekend. I'll try my best to explain what happened over the past month, but I am not entirely sure how it happened myself. I have had oneitis for one of my female roomates good friends. I'll call her Kate. Kate is an HB8 with an insane body. I had befriended her, but over the months have kept out of the friend zone by teasing her ALL the time. About a month ago my female roommate left town, and Kate and I decide to hang out. Typically I don't get 1 on 1 time with her so I'm pretty stoked about this.

She arrives at my place, and to my dismay, she has a friend with her. At that point, I assumed I was completely friend zoned. She brought a friend over to hang out, meaning she clearly doesn't want me alone. I was a little irriated and totally made the worst of the situation. I rolled over for this girl, and let her invite MORE girls over to drink with us. Soon enough, there were 6 girls at my house, me and a couple of my roommates. I couldn't get it into my head that there were 6 HBs in MY house, all I could think about was the fact that this chick was using me and the location of my house to pregame for her night of partying. 

Then in comes my savior, I'm gonna call her Helga. An HB6 at best. The clear leader of this pack of women. A complete bitch who thinks she owns my room the second she walks in. The type of girl who somehow gets these women to follow her and is a complete cock block once they do. She walks into my room where we all are hanging out, and I try to introduce myself. She literally says ""Do I know you?"" In a tone that i'm sure you can imagine. I was pretty irritated at this point and that pressed my last button. I locked eyes with her grabbed her hand and laughingly said ""You do now bitch, I'm gnouwn, and you're in my house"". It just came out, mostly out of anger, but for whatever reason this was the key to the night. The rest of the night Helga was trying to prove herself to me. Every time she said something, I would ignore her or tease her and by the end of the night she was practically begging me to have sex with her. I was ignoring her because I genuinely did not like her, and she started to like me because of it. After I kicked them all out, Kate texted me with Helgas phone number, saying Helga was way into me (no shit) and I respond saying that I don't do booty calls this late.

2 nights later this same group of girls come over, plus a few new ones. All of the girls are being way more friendly to me after I put Helga in her place. Again though, Helga will not leave me alone, and immediately one of the new girls who doesn't know Helga starts to try to cut in and start talking to me. We will call her Mary, and she is a HB8. I hit it off with her pretty quick, but she is the one initiating conversation, I didn't have to do anything. I get a call from a friend at a party who wants me to come over. So I get this group of girls in my house and head to the party.

I finally realize what is happening as I walk up to the front door of the party. I am about to go into a party, with a group of 8 girls and a few of my guy roommates. 8 HOT WOMEN ARE FOLLOWING **ME** INTO A PARTY. I walk in with my head held high, and loudly greet my friend. I make the decision at that moment that I am awesome, all these people want to be me. Not 5 minutes after entering I make eye contact with a HB9 accross the room. *All these guys want to be me and all these girls want me.* I don't think twice about it and walk straight up to her, no idea what to say. I smile and say ""You're pretty"". She responds ""Is that your best pickup line?"". I say ""Yeah, and based on the smile on your face I think it is working"". Conversation continues. I won't say it was perfect but I got her number :D

I leave the party after a bit to head home, and a few of the girls from **my** group follow me back. On the way back I lend Mary my jacket because she is cold. We get back to my house and Helga comes back to my place soon after, and I see more of seddit at work. Helga sees Mary wearing my jacket. Without asking goes straight to my closet and rips out some clothes and sweatpants and puts them on. It's so obvious that they are fighting over me that I have to hold back laughter.

Oh and remember Kate from the beginning? After seeing how high value I am, she wouldn't stop texting me the whole week following this. We hung out the following weekend, one thing lead to another, and we slept together :D

**edit:** Here is more on what happened with Kate that some suggested i edit in.
Kate was texting me not stop all week. I had this ongoing joke all week that she was secretly an alien, which for some reason she loved. That weekend she invited me to a friend of hers to hang out. There were 4 of us. She was physically pushing/punching/wrestling from the moment I got there, and it was obvious that she was more into me than before. We ended up playing some games, and eventually the other 2 went to bed. I sat with her on the floor and talked for a while, eventually we started playing footsie and her body language was clear.

I was actually kind of nervous at this point, because I knew I could get some. I stood up and told her I was going to get in bed, and I smiled at her and told her exactly what room I was going to. Made it obvious that she could come with me, but I wasn't going to force her. I turned around and walked straight to the room without a second thought. I was happy enough that I had a good night, and I knew she was into me. I may have wanted more but was content with what happened. Not 5 minutes later she was in bed with me and I was removing her clothes.

",1127,335,218,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12fdkk/what_dating_companies_dont_want_you_to_know_about/,"Over a year ago I sat in my computer chair typing a goodbye post to the readers and customers that I spent 5 years of my life teaching and working with. I tried to explain why I was leaving a company that I built with no plan to ever return.



Today I am sitting that same chair trying to type a post that I have wanted to share with people for over a year.  There is A LOT of bull shit that SOME coaches and companies shove down the throat of the consumer to SELL you shit. I am here today as in insider to dispel that BS and give you actual advice and I'm not going to charge you a dime or make you visit my website because I want more hits. Out of all my 5+ years involved in the dating scene &amp; teaching these are the most important lessons that I could EVER give anyone. 



**1) Your Appearance Matters, Fix it.**

Dating coaches like to say that looks don't matter and thus work on your game. They are liars. Looks matter for more reasons than you know. First off, looks matter because women value men that they are going to show off to their family and friends. If you look like a wreck she won't show it off. Think about your first car? Was it a pile of shit? Rusted, maybe broken down? You don't want to show that off, you just want it to fill the void until you can upgrade, welcome to the world of women. 



Secondly, your appearance matters because it is an outward expression of how you feel about yourself. It shows your self-discipline and dedication to who you think you are. If you value something you take care of it, period. 



Lastly, I have learned time and time again that a very high quality woman will sleep with guys who aren't that physically attractive but they RARELY get in relationships with them.  If someone tells you looks don't matter then they are lying or don't know WTF they are talking about. Looks can be DRASTICALLY improved by educating yourself. See /r/malefashionadvice 



**2) Attraction isn't something you do, it's something that you become.** 

Want to know how to build attraction? Become attractive. Words, lines, routines, banter, all this BS people shove down your throat isn't what women find attractive. What women find attractive is **the person delivering these things**. Attraction at its core is self confidence and when you actually talk TO a girl instead of talking ABOUT her, you are starting to teach yourself confidence, this is why approaching works, it teaches guys to overcome their fear and replace it with confidence. 



**Here is how to become attraction rather than ACTING like you are attractive.** 

Develop a since of fashion and look good EVERYTIME you walk out that door. 
Take care of your body, lose weight fix your smile do whatever you have to do. 
SMILE like you know something they don't. 
Watch and study people who are attractive, IE James Bond &amp; Chuck Bass (Gossip Girl). 
Slow down. Relax, stop reacting so fast. 
Make eye contact with people. 
Socialize with people. 
Do fun things in your life, IE live your passions, travel, learn about wine, scotch, culture. 



**3) Men tend to look for sex objects and women tend to look for success objects.** 

Success comes in many forms depending on the woman evaluating the man. Coaches and companies drop the ball here because they don't tell you how to actually KEEP the girl interested. Guys, flat out honest advice here, fix your lifestyle. If you are bringing a girl back to your mom's basement you are not ""cool"" you are a serial killer. All the awesome clothes and cars in the world aren't getting you past that one.  If your place looks more like a Goodwill than a home, you might want to work on that.  Because women usually don’t go to Goodwill to have sex. Fix your life before you fix your game. Success starts at your home NOT at the bar. Keep your house/room clean, smelling amazing and NICE. Don't know how to do that, fucking learn. /r/malelivingspace 




**4) Confidence is Almost Everything.** 

Coaches and companies miss the mark here when they try to sell you lines rather than the truth. The truth is, confidence is everything when it comes to women. I say to people all the time it's amazing what you get away with in life and love when you have a suit and a confident smile. I am not going to sit here and talk about the countless stories I have and sell you some BS product, I am giving you the straight forward truth. Confidence is everything in life and love and whether you find it in the pickup community or a monastery in Thailand, you must learn to create it in your own life. Confidence is the key to unlocking the rest of your goals in life. I spent my entire life learning how to create confidence in my own life and I can say that it has been among the greatest gifts that I have given myself. 



**5) Being a Value Giver.** 

How we value ourselves come through in the people that we talk to, how we value other people is a tell tale sign of a confident man or an arrogant man. When you give value to other people regardless of their sex, race, religion and attractiveness to you, you are bringing people up rather than putting them down like so many others do. There is a lot of negativity in this world today but being a person who gives value is about giving freely without expectation or reservation.  An arrogant man insults and seeks to make himself better than others around him and a self confident man seeks to better the people around him. Why does this matter when it comes to women? If you have to ask that question, you are already doing it wrong. Giving value to others is about THEM, not YOU. If you have to ask what is in it for me then you are already being a taker rather than a giver. When you give value to others you come from a place of selfLESSness, not selfishness. When you seek to better the people around you, you will notice a lot of other things fall into place, but please don't believe me, TRY IT.




**6) You Don't Need A Coach or Company To Teach You.**

My students never needed me, they wanted to learn and get a different perspective on things because they were confused. Every student I had came to me with one thing in common, they wanted confidence. The fact of the matter is you don't NEED a dating coach, the dating coach NEEDS you or they are broke. Why am I telling you this? Because you should expect more than old rehashed lines and routines from the people you pay money to. There are MANY good teachers and companies out there and I encourage you to find them if you want a coach but know that you can do this 100% on your own.  If you work on developing a sense of style, hit the gym, eat right, socialized and be a willing participant to break the walls of fear that have kept you from succeeding you WILL be successful with women.  



I could write several articles on many other things regarding this topic but I will finish here by saying the following. Life is meant to be lived outside the confines of a message board. Pursue the passions that you have inside of you because life isn't a dress rehearsal.  When you find what you are passionate about you awaken a fire inside of you and women see that. Passions will come and go, and this is ok but along the journey don't give into fear because something is uncomfortable, embrace it and define it.

When you call to make a reservation, ask the host or hostess what their favorite meal is. Make small talk, be friendly, say you've never been there. Chances are, they'll be working when you show up.

This is how it usually plays out for me: I show up date in hand, say my name, and the host/hostess lights up because of our conversation earlier.

It shows some social proof to my date, a bit of a DHV even, and the hostess puts you in the best seats available. They always wonder, ""How does he do that?""

Every time you're out and feel a bit uncomfortable in a social situation, or you're between sets and not talking to anyone for a minute you get that temptation to pull out your phone to appear busy... DON'T DO IT. 

Instead, try looking around and count the number of people who are on their phones and smile to yourself, because you are already demonstrating higher value than they are. That should boost your confidence enough to re-engage in being social. 

Whenever I leave my phone in my pocket, I end up meeting people, and I usually close at least one girl by the end of the night. Your email/internet connection is a crutch, and it holds you back. 

As even more incentive, while you're counting who is on their phone, find a girl in that group and go talk to her. If she's on her phone, she's in serious need of someone to relieve her anxiety and will usually be very grateful for an approach. Even if she's just standing with some guy nervously checking his phone, if you walk up and give her that charming, cocky smirk and introduce yourself, you'll seem like a real man to her compared to the guy being anti-social on his phone. 

Force yourself to be present and approachable, women will notice.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_1a3rbs,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1a3rbs/stop_checking_your_phone/,
1365611947.0,754,self.seduction,1c2lk3,Advice to all of you from a bi guy,974,220,269,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1c2lk3/advice_to_all_of_you_from_a_bi_guy/,"Want to learn a ton about the rights and wrongs of hitting on women in one night? Go to a gay club. 

No, I'm not joking, and I promise that you'll learn more than you ever will reading books or studying. 

""Why?"" you ask, ""there aren't even any women there for me to 'practice my mad skills'!"" You'd be right, you're not likely to find anyone there that you'd be interested in, but it's a fun place to be when you're with friends and want to have a good time. 

That is EXACTLY the point. You're going to go in there and not be attracted to any of the people in there (like how a 9 or 10 might feel going to a club with her friends). And you're going to get stares from/ hit on by a lot of guys that you have absolutely no interest in (this is also dependent on how physically attractive you are, which is also something that a lot of women constantly deal with in social situations like clubbing). You're going to get the closest idea of how it feels to be a smokin' hot woman at a club that you'll ever get, and you'll learn a lot from it. 

How do I know all of this? Because I go to gay clubs all the time, and I know exactly what it feels like to have 20 guys come up to me with corny pick up lines or trying to act all macho and impressive or being creepy and staring at me from across the room, or telling me how ""cute"" and ""handsome"" and ""beautiful"" I am. NONE of those things will get you anywhere. I'm the non-straight, male version of that stereotypical, bitchy hotty that won't dance with anyone at a club. Not because I'm actually that bitchy, but because I know that ""nice guys"" aren't really that nice, guys who seem to have huge egos actually don't have that much confidence and are over-compensating, and I don't just sleep with anything with a pulse. You know what kind of guy really gets me though? What kind of guy that I'd actually consider going home with? One who I spend the night talking to instead of dancing with. One who can hold a conversation and my attention. Not someone who is overflowing with ""confidence"" or who is the center of attention, because if you ARE the center of attention it's probably not for a good reason. 

Side note: No, I'm not a flamer, and I don't go after flamers, I like guys who have a healthy dose of manly manliness in them, so I think that the advice I'm trying to give is somewhat valid.

I finally ended my first real relationship with a girl I truly had a connection with - no gimmick pickup lines, no schemantics, no entry-level seddit stuff. To her, I was attractive because I was my true, confident self, which in itself is a great feeling. Plus meaningful sex is far more enjoyable than one-night stands.

This sub gets a bad rap for a lot of things, but it taught me how to have a genuine, real relationships with another human being. 

Today she thanked me, because I helped her see all the great things that she didn't see in herself. Though I'm sad, I feel great. Because I think that's what being a man really is: giving value to others.

I moved back to America, got a job, smoked a ton of weed, and basically ignored self improvement the entire time. I got rusty. I stagnated. Then I realized I hated my job, and got another job based around Japan again. My new job involves lots of travel (good!) with a relatively static social group living together, including many cute girls (better!). I stepped up to the plate...

...and immediately crashed and burned. I went through all the rookie mistakes: One-itis. Nice Guy Syndrome. The Pedestal. Chasing her. Buying gifts. And most damningly, forgetting that my mission must trump all. It's like I thought I could ignore the gym for a year, then jump right back in and squat 400. NO. SIR.

So I got my ass handed to me righteously. I got dark. I got sad. Then I got up, and I got to work. Back to the gym. Back to my music. Back to my studies. Back to seddit. It feels great to be on the horse again. It feels like the clouds parting and the light shining through. It feels like seeing a good friend after years apart, and that friend is The Truth.

I am thrumming. I am alive with excitement and hope. I know that failure is temporary, as long as I am willing to get back up, to keep moving, to learn, and to act on those lessons. All that negativity I felt earlier was valid, as a lesson. But I am not condemned to be that negativity, to live in that darkness. I have all the tools to keep growing and glowing. They have always been there, even when I was blind to them, willingly or unknowingly.

I do not need to stumble and grope after women, perpetually stung by the cold winds of their indifference, or at best barely comforted in the meager glow of a lukewarm romance. There are women everywhere, and there is only one of me.

I am the prize.

I will build a temple of myself, a glorious monument to achievement, passion, ambition and dedication. I will decide the course of my life, and persevere with my own interests in mind. I will not need to chase my dreams, for they rest firmly in my hands. I see proof of them with every authentic action I take.

I am the prize, and because I know I am the prize, I do not fear rejection. Women cannot reject me. They can only reject themselves from the glory of my company. If she does not like me, she was never meant to be to my liking, and I thank her for not wasting my time. There is no woman worth compromising my authenticity, for the second I do so, I am no longer the prize.

I am the prize. It may be frustrating at first, not to throw myself at every opportunity for sex. But I am worth more than sex. I deserve more than sex. I deserve a woman who excites me. I deserve a woman who respects me. I deserve a woman who intrigues me. I deserve a woman who inspires me. I deserve a woman who cares for me. Why?

Because I am the prize. How do I know I am the prize? I prove it every day, every moment, with my actions. I strive, unceasingly, to be the best version of myself. I strengthen my body. I sharpen my mind. I explore the world with an insatiable curiosity. I do not allow mediocrity to seep into my life. I do not allow others to choose my identity or decide my destiny. I make mistakes, and I laugh at them, because laughter is one of the best things there is, and then I learn from them, because a mistake is just a lesson clothed in temporary failure. I have one life, and I will not disrespect the infinite improbability of my very existence by squandering it daydreaming about what could have been.

Simply put: I demand excellence of myself—why shouldn’t I demand it of women? Love is crucial to life, but life is so much bigger than love, and only a big life, a life filled with adventure and effort and passion, will be large enough to hold love and keep it burning, without crumbling under its weight or being consumed in its fire.

I don’t worry about them, and when I do, I remember not to. I worry about me. Why? Because.

I am the prize.

**EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect this to blow up at all! I'm very happy to see others get inspired and GET TO WORK! For the haters, I can understand how this seems arrogant or narcissistic, but this post comes from a place of humility. I thought I could be The Prize without doing the work, and life served me a huge slice of humble pie. Woe unto he who shirks doing the work. To better yourself, you must understand your faults. So I owned up. I started doing the work. I realized that doing the work is the source of all that is good in a man's life.**

**Being the prize is not about unreasonable self-aggrandizement. It is about commitment to becoming a better person.

1343417207.0,752,self.seduction,x9gku,"Gents, women ARE NOT the root of all happiness. They ARE merely a perk that comes from leading a fulfilling, interesting life. ",964,212,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x9gku/gents_women_are_not_the_root_of_all_happiness/,"[20m] here. Seddit, I've been perusing your posts for months now, learning a great deal in the process, and I can honestly say that I've undergone a life changing transformation as a result. However, instead of working tirelessly to improve my day game, kino application or club sarging techniques, like many of you, I've instead focused on improving the quality of my own life, a life that doesn't revolve around women or sex, and it has paid enormous dividends. Let me tell you my story.

You see, I lost my mother to cancer 2 years ago and, without going into too much detail, it left a whole in my heart, that I was convinced could only be filled by having a women in my life. So, for months I obsessed over this miscalculation, letting the perpetual pursuit for a significant other take over my life. I dreamt about finding a girlfriend  at night, i day-dreamt about finding one while i rotted in school and i fantasized about it when I got home.

Inevitably, when any woman showed a glimmer of interest in me, my fixation would get even worse; I would become so clingy, so abnormally fast, that it would scare them off before any sort of relationship could develop at all. The worst part was that, in the chains of my naive delusion, I had no idea why this was happening. 

Once it began to happen over and over and over, I became a depressed wreck, convinced that I was an unattractive loser who would never have a girlfriend. This mindset, as you can probably guess, only further compounded my failures with women; and, as a result, I holed up in my house, blocked out my friends, family and whatever passions I had once enjoyed, in favor of indulging my sorrows. I had hit rock bottom.

It was then, at my lowest point, that I serendipitously discovered Seddit. I began reading and I soon realized that, in my present state of mind, I would have no chance with women even if I knew all the tricks of the PUA trade. Women can sense when a man has an abundance mentality, happiness, confidence and passion and, you know what? I had none of those things. This might well be the most important realization of my life. I finally recognized that I was undesirable to the opposite sex, **NOT BECAUSE I'M UNATTRACTIVE OR AN INHERENT LOSER**, but because I was, for lack of a better term, boring!

*I had limited myself to a solitary goal in life: meet a girl.* Now tell me, who in their right mind, man or woman, would want to date someone who only cares about one thing in life? Weather it be a job, a person, a sport or what have you, if one's life revolves around one thing, especially if that one thing is meeting women, the opposite sex will not be interested in you past a shallow attraction! 

Sure you might have the odd good night where you get laid, after meeting a pretty girl at a club, but I'm here to tell you that those successes alone, while fantastic in the short term, will not make you a happy, fulfilled individual. Life is not all about women or sex.

Since I learned this fact I have worked tirelessly to improve myself in all facets of life. I've hit the gym 4-5 days a week and I dieted, not to improve my appearance for the ladies, but to prove to myself that I too can be a physically fit healthy person.

I've taught myself a multitude of new skills, that I genuinely enjoy doing and have become passionate about, such as cooking, blogging and slalom skiing. These things have consumed so much time that I no longer even have a mili second to think about that aforementioned hole in my heart, and I have become a much happier person. My mom wouldn't have wanted me to pout about her loss, or come up with ridiculous ways in which her absence could be compensated for, she would have wanted me to live a fulfilling life and I'll be damned if that's not what I'm going to do! But I digress.

Wouldn't you know it that, now that my happiness doesn't hinge upon the attention of women, I'm receiving a ton of it. I've had more women open me in the past month than I've opened, using daygame, in my whole life. Moreover, now, when I approach women in the club, I have a story to tell, I'm passionate about many things and have no limit of conversation topics. I have confidence in my appearance and an abundance mentality to boot, which I unconsciously exude to everyone I talk to and people just seem to eat it up, especially women. 

But do you know what the kicker is? I'm so happy with the way that my life is going right now that I am completely outcome independent! I used to dwell on my failures, when I went home at night, to the point where I made myself sick and now, I have 0, I repeat, 0 fucks to give when it comes to picking up women.

**Now that I have no fear of failure, I no longer fail at all because no matter what happens, I win!** If I go home with a women (which happens more often than not now when I set my mind to it), I win. If I don't go home with a woman, I still win because, as I said before, I don't give a fuck. My happiness does not hinge upon the success of my sexual endeavors. 

So gentlemen, I beseech you, do not focus all of your efforts on picking up women, because, in that case, when you fail, it can be painful and all consuming. Especially when you have nothing to go home to but thoughts of your own shortcomings. 

On the other hand, when you put all your effort into living a fulfilling, passionate, interesting life, even when you do lose with that member of the opposite sex, you still fucking win, baby. You go home, cook yourself a fantastic meal, read about slalom skiing technique, and write a blog post about the incredible experiences you've had since you turned your life around, and realize, when you lie down in bed at night, that you're life is so god damned amazing that you have 0 fucks left to give about that boring HB who rejected you at the club. You've used them all up on more important and interesting endeavors. 

**The moral of my story is that if you work hard, happiness will come and women will follow. Not the other way around!** 

Sorry for the length!

* Above all, what helps me the most is my overall comfortability with women. Hang out with gorgeous women as friends, often. Go to lunch, buy them a taco. Have chat. This pays dividends.

**Approaching**

* Just fucking do it. Right. Now. Direct, opinion openers, I don't care. There's a saying in boxing ""The correct punch is the one that lands."" Sometimes a hook is better than a straight, sometimes it isn't. Do both, be confident with either way. Walk up, stand in front of them ""Hi. I'm here to steal your purse.""

**Conversationing**

* Try to make everything unique, be a stand up comic. these guys do it for a living,Look at something we see, use every day, and try to rephrase it to something unique and funny. If you can't be original, download lesser known stand up albums, listen to them, and just rephrase what they say conversationally, until you can do it yourself. I love Patrice O'neal and Russel Brand. Both very alpha (and incredibly successful with women) as opposed to a Louis CK who is a beta, (incredibly funny) but not someone slaying it with the ladies.

* Be emotional, use ""we"", thread sexual imagery. If you can do these things with a girl successfully you can almost always progress VERY fast. One I use all the time if she is taking too long to answer a question ""Am I going to have to pin your arms to your side, grab you strongly, and shake you like a magic 8 ball to get the answer? I don't think you want that"" *Sly I will fuck you right now smirk.*

* Callibrate, but don't over do it. I offend people and cross that line inevitably. I spent far too much time worrying about callibration, and being just perfect. Seriously, fuck that. I'm going to upset you, I might even use the word cunt as a noun, or cunty as an adjective. Don't fucking apologize for this, use it as a chance to make things sexual and CORRECTLY dominate the frame. The go to line here is ""Don't worry, I'll make it up to you. I give great massages""  from one of the top posts in this sub.

* Snap come backs - sometimes you have to say a comeback, or something contextually witty on the fly. get in the practice of this. If you don't have anything. Smirk chuckle to yourself and keep eye contact. Don't say anything, but have something up your sleeve for when you have to.

**Tailoring your game.**

* I've gamed in English, Spanish, Dancing, and failed in sign language. In the 7 different countries, completely different areas of the states I have been to game can wildly change. game != game != game. Pick up the intricacies of your area, and incorporate them, but don't let it rule your game. Be firm, but flexible, and anticipate how people will react differently to you.

**The Company you keep**

* The most overlooked aspect of this whole thing, and easily one of the most important for a growing player. Don't keep negative company. Cut them out of your life immediately. Pick up people who are positive, well liked, and happy. Win these people over in EVERY aspect of your life. If you're surrounded by good looking, rising, happy, people, you're doing a lot of things right.

* New hobbies. Get them. Yoga pants are awesome bro.

**Sex**

* I was really good at sex. Really fucking good, I could time my orgasms to be within 10 seconds of when I wanted, and usually had simultaneous orgasms with my girls, and could guarantee I was one of the best fucks of their life. This fucked me up. I was so ultimately concerned with their pleasure, that I didn't care about mine. My pleasure came from their pleasure.
* My girlfriends and girls I was with: They. Never. Fucked. Me. I'm not joking. Even elation can be boring. She could sit on a god-damned sybian (what are those upside-down horse cocks called?) and get pure robotic, amazing sex, but a lot of women don't.
* Instead, focus on your pleasure, girls want to feel like they are giving you pleasure. This clicks something deep inside of them (no pun intended). Tell them how hard they make you, how much they're turning you on. Do you know how validating that is that you can make someone feel amazing? Like they're reaching the mountain top because of YOUR looks, and YOUR skill, and YOUR body. Make the girls feel like this. Girls CRAWL back to me now, and want to fuck me so much more. And you know what? The sex is so much worse for them than it was back before this. Change your frame brother.

* Gentleman's wash. If you don't know what those words mean. Look it up. not at work.

**Non Judgmental attitude.**

* This took me far too long to figure out. Stay away from jokes that are judgmental of other people, and especially towards her, or her sexuality. Obvious fake judgment is cool, so long as it's funny and it works. But actively create a non-judgmental attitude ""What, I thought this was the trust tree."" You would not believe what a comfortable carefree environment has gotten in terms of crazy sex, because I was the knowledgeable, non-judgmental guy.

**Set the frame early**

* Picked this up from 50 Shades of Grey. Start telling her what to do very early on. ""Hey, hold this for me."" ""I'm going to have to punish you for that behavior.""  ""don't ever do that again."" Start with little things and work your way up. It's a bigger shock to her system if you go from beta male to ""TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF."" and she will be more unlikely to do it, than if you have been subtlety ordering her around all night, and telling her to do stuff. After that you can then bust out the ""Take your pants of. Now."" and win.

* a note on the frame. Sometimes you need to take it to a level unknown to you. I have a story from 2 weeks ago, where I went out with these two girls, and 1 spilled some shit all over my car, and she was a little drunk and denied it. I saw it. My response? ""I know you did it, stop acting like a child.""  ""I did not!"" She pulled out some sort of fake anger, and I did not take the high road when I replied: ""SHUT THE FUCK UP. RIGHT. NOW. I HAVE TO FUCKING CLEAN UP AFTER YOU BECAUSE YOU SPILLED THIS SHIT ALL OVER MY CAR."" She shut up, and when we went into her place she had the look. that piercing gaze. That one. We then fucked like drunk monkies all night.

**Rejection**

* Don't start hating women and thinking they're all the same. Every person is going through different shit at different times of the day/month/year. Fuck, a bum grabbed me in Argentina and I threw him against a wall and almost went all Patrick Bateman on him in the middle of a crowded street during the day light hours. If I were a girl, and a dude walked up to me less than 5 minutes after that? with some direct, ""I want to fuck you"" opener? I probably would have wound up in prison. Not because of the guy coming up to me, but because my body was still in fight or flight mode and I would have taken it out on whoever entered my space. Just remember, timing is important, and girls aren't being bitches, they're acting like that because they're worried about losing face in a social situation. Sometimes they're just bitches.

**P.S.**

1371647851.0,715,self.seduction,1gnind,Why Your Text Game Sucks,923,208,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gnind/why_your_text_game_sucks/,"We’ve all seen this post, “I’m texting this girl, it’s going great, then she disappears, what happened? What do I do?”

For some reason this reminds me of 18th Century medicine. “I’ve been sick, and I started taking this medicine that made me feel a lot better, and then I kept taking it and now I’m more sick than before, what happened? What do I do?”

The problem is that you were taking soluble arsenic, which works as a stimulant and in very small doses can cause sick people to feel much better. The problem is that it’s arsenic and will kill you. What do you do? You don’t take the damn arsenic.

Same thing with text game. Your text game goes down hill not because you weren’t doing it well, but because it’s text game, and that’s just what text game does. It builds a quick spike of interest, but ultimately kills it.

Try to see text game from the girl’s perspective. A guy you met and kinda liked sends you a text message. It’s funny or interesting, and you’re excited to hear back from him, and you respond. Replies go back and forth, it’s all good, but at some point you’ve got to get on with your day. It’s becoming a chore to keep responding to every nagging message and that guy who you thought was cute now seems like he’s starved for attention. You know that if you reply he’s going to reply, and the whole thing will just keep going.

So as a girl what do you do? Odds are you just start ignoring his texts. Either you ignore them mid-conversation or you end the conversation but when he texts you again a few days later you ignore that because you know what a giant time sink texting with him will be.

**Logistics**

The key to good text game is to see texting as just a logistical tool. It’s not for conversation, it’s not for trying to build attraction, it’s not for showing how smart and clever you are. It is there just to arrange face-to-face meetings.

Ideally you will only send one fluff message before you start arranging your next meeting. Set a hard limit at two, and don’t be afraid to skip the fluff and go straight for the meetup.

This is a tough lesson for many guys to learn because it takes them out of their comfort zone. They’re used to communicating through instant messaging, it’s how they socialized with their friends growing up, and it gives them the time and space to ask for advice from other guys. On the other hand, talking face-to-face with a girl is foreign, it’s hell on the nerves, and you might say something stupid and screw it up.

Too bad. Attraction is built in person, not on a little two inch screen. Trying to develop text game is not a substitute for developing genuine social skills.

**But I Know Someone With Good Text Game!**

Yeah? So do I. It happens. There are also tons of documented cases of people in the 1700s being treated with arsenic and fully recovering from their disease. That doesn’t mean it’s a good idea for you.

You can work on texting to round out your toolbox, but only after you’ve mastered the fundamentals. Have you conquered approach anxiety? Can you regularly get a set to hook? Isolate? Venue change and number close? Manage obstacles? Do you have a good rate of converting numbers into Day 2s?

If not, you’re not genuinely trying to perfect your game, you’re just trying to avoid doing the hard work of interacting in person. And I can sympathize with this. I’m a (semi)pro writer and my skill level with writing absolutely blows away my talking. They’re not even in the same league. It doesn’t matter how good my writing is though. It can be the rarest most highly refined stuff out there, but it’s just rare, highly refined …arsenic, and it will never perform as well as some generic mid-grade penicillin. It’s just not the right tool for the job, just like even the greatest text game will never be a substitute for the clumsiest experience opening sets.

**The Great Time-to-Anxiety Converter**

The last thing I want to say about this is that you need to beware text game because of its ability to wreck your life. I regularly see guys agonizing over what to text. They’ll spend hours trying to get those 140 characters just right, consulting with dozens of people and creating draft after draft. Presidential speech writers won’t spend that much time on a single line for the State of the Union.

The medium of texting is just far too conducive to converting your time into anxiety. In person you get about half a second to think, you say something, and if it’s not perfect you know what happens? Generally nothing. It’s never as bad as you think, and she’s busy worrying if you think what she’s saying is stupid. And if you did say something completely boneheaded? You get instant feedback instead of worrying about how she took it and asking all your internet friends how they think she took it, and should you send another text following up, how long do you wait, do you acknowledge the stupid thing you said, blah blah blah.

Just think about the more productive uses for your time.

**A Simple Guide to Body Language**

All right, let's talk about body language. Body language before and during your approach specifically. Other than physical touch, body language is probably THE difference that separates the champs from the chumps. And I have some great news for you guys... Going from bad body language to good body language is probably **the highest return-on-investment you will ever find** when studying seduction. An hour behind a mirror and a few nights out is all you need to get the ball rolling in the right direction. You just need to bring some awareness to your body language.

**1) Your mother was right - stand up straight!**

Slouching is a turn off. There is no simpler way to state this. Barring medical reasons, from now on you will never not stand up straight. EVER. Be conscious of your posture at all times and make an active effort to sit and stand up straight. Just get used to it, it's part of the new you.

**2) ""But... what do I do with my hands?""**

First off, stop thinking about your fucking hands. No one cares about your goddamn hands. The more you think about them, the more in your head you're going to be. Keep them down on your sides. That's it. That's all you need to know. Anything beyond that is mental masturbation.

**3) Smirk**

You know the smirk I'm talking about. The one that makes you think, ""That guy intrigues me. I wonder what he's thinking about."" It's between ""too goofy"" and ""too serious."" It screams ""doesn't take himself too seriously."" It looks relaxed. It has a touch of smugness to it, but not too much. It's that look on your face when you're rocking that new sexy haircut and outfit before you go out, when you catch yourself in the mirror and think, ""Oh fuck yeah, I'm looking good."" Get to know that smirk well, it is now the face you will showcase to the world when you're out talking to women.

**4) Motherfucking eye contact**

Eye contact! If there is anything resembling a magic pill, this is it! You MUST get comfortable looking people in the eye and not breaking eye contact first. Men who are successful in life do this. They hold eye contact. Look DIRECTLY into her eye and DO NOT LOOK AWAY. I don't give a shit if you're a foot away or across the room from her, HOLD IT. You will feel a rush of energy, nerves, and POWER. Learn to love that feeling, it's the feeling of you becoming a man who is successful with women, kiddo. Run with it.

**5) Get CLOSE to her, damn it!**

To quote Rob Judge, ""Personal space is for pussies."" I already told you that the most successful seducers are those who can't keep their hands off of women. Well you're not gonna be able to do that if you aren't in close! Shake her hand, hold the handshake for *just* slightly longer than most guys would, and close the gap between you and the girl until you can feel the sexual tension thicken up. This is how you demonstrate intent in your approach. 

Trust me, if you've got that ""I'd fuck me"" smirk on your face, standing tall, holding eye contact, right up closer to the girl than most guys, she will KNOW that you desire her and want to get to know her better. You can literally say anything at this point and you've made a direct approach. Congrats! Speaking of approaching...

---

**The Approach**

A quick pop quiz for you. Which of these are good openers?

* *""Hi. How's your day going?""*

* *""Excuse me. I just have to say, you are absolutely stunning. I'd be kicking myself if I didn't introduce myself...""*

* *""Oh my god, I love your sense of fashion.""*

* *""Hey, help me decide which martini to order.""*

* *""Where you girls from?*

Trick question. They're all awesome because you're a non-needy, sexy man with GOOD BODY LANGUAGE.

Master body language and you'll never have to think of a pickup line again. You can open with pretty much anything. Congrats!

But what about approach anxiety? Yes, it's real. Yes, it never goes away. But you've made a decision to get good at this stuff, haven't you? If you haven't, then why the fuck are you reading this? Go jerk off; I hear lonely tears make excellent lube. Otherwise, follow the Action Items in this guide and you'll be well on your way to success.

---

**Action Items**

1) Re-read the Action Items in [Part 2.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11yjkw/above_the_game_part_2_fundamentals_of_attraction/) If you haven't done those items yet, stop immediately and do them. This is how you get over approach anxiety.

2) Wherever you are, focus on standing or sitting up straight. Let this thought dominate your mind for a week. It will feel a little weird at first, but you will be surprised how quickly it will become second nature. From now on, standing up straight is part of your routine. It will become something you just do, like putting on your underwear and socks.

3) Find the biggest mirror you can find. Make and HOLD eye contact with yourself for 60 seconds straight. Say silly things like, *""Hey sexy,""* and *""Yep, I'd fuck me.""* This is going to be a little weird, but trust me on this. You have to get comfortable holding eye contact with someone - it might as well be yourself!

4) Next, smirk! Do something, ANYTHING, to get you fired up and smiling. Go beat that level in Mario Kart or watch some cat videos or literally ANYTHING to make you smile. Now look in the mirror and convert that smile to a smirk. If you're unsure what it looks like, take some photos and send them to me, I'll tell you. But I bet the majority of you guys will intuitively understand what I'm talking about when I say smirk. [Channel your inner Clooney.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-avYnd-fJ2X8/UAG2IRkFQ4I/AAAAAAAAA5o/PWHo8Wmh3aM/s400/george_clooney_smirk.jpg) Practice this 15 minutes a day for a week.

5) Before steps 6 &amp; 7, send a text message to a close friend or post in /r/100sets that you will be out approaching. HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE. Make people follow up with you. Prepare to post a field report afterwards.

6) Go to a bar or nightclub that will have a lot of women. Keep only one thing in mind - you are there to practice getting in close when you speak to women and NOTHING MORE. Approach 10 different girls or groups of girls (they can be hot, ugly, or anything in between) with your eye contact, nice posture, and smirk. Say, ""Hi. What's your name?"" Hold that eye contact and get closer than you normally would. This is going to feel really weird and might creep some girls out till you get it right, but WHO CARES. You are only there to practice one thing and one thing only. Plus I bet at least a couple of them will be receptive. Get used to being in closer with the women you speak with, this is how guys get laid in bars from cold approaches. You'll need to have some experience in this area if you plan to get good with women. Do this for 5 nights.

7) Go to a busy daytime venue, perhaps a mall, a park, a busy street corner, or a train station. Do the same thing as step 6. Try to get just closer than you used to. Try to feel the sexual tension as you look the girl in the eye. Make some small talk and maybe even ask her for her phone number. Congrats, you just had a successful daytime approach and you're only on part 3 of this guide!

8) Post at least two field reports. Tell everyone what you're doing and ask for feedback. Take it to heart and bathe in words of encouragement.",Comprehensive,False,,t5_2qhrv,1374516706.0,,,True,t3_1dd13a,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1dd13a/above_the_game_part_3_body_language_how_to/,moderator
1350141563.0,699,self.seduction,11ezuv,"[FR] ""You can be my wingwoman!""",892,193,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11ezuv/fr_you_can_be_my_wingwoman/,"So lately I've noticed what were once called ""Field Reports"" with graphic descriptive stories meshed with tips and how to's have evolved into ""hey I fucked this girl last night"". Is the community turning naive? Not really, just the new guys on here believe that this is all about nailing that one girl you set your eyes on. It's not about that. 

Ok, it's totally about that.

But for me, I'm all about having fun regardless if I get laid at the end of the night. That, my friends, is the most important thing in my eyes. Last night that was exactly what I was setting out to do and I did this with one simple phrase...

""You can be my wingwoman!""

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* My roommates were at a house party and I got off work late so I decided to walk down to the main street where there are tons of bars and enjoy myself solo, something I hadn't done in a long time. Instead of going to one set place, I dipped my toes in everywhere. I walked down to one of the popular spots and stopped in to have a beer and make some new friends in the meantime. My buddy whom I met a week before was working the door so I breezed right in for the cost of a handshake. **I highly suggest making friends with the bartenders, doormen, servers, etc. at your favorite spots. It makes your nights much more exciting and it's demonstrating value to those around you.** If you're clueless on how to do this, one week just offer a handshake and exchange names. The week after maybe they remember you...if not I refresh myself to them by re-introducing myself (normally if I forget their name). Eventually they will remember you.

* So anyway as I walk through the door I see a ratio of about 8 hotdogs to 1 bun. It's not looking good...if you're only out for one reason. Make the most of your night, don't get tunnel vision..the party moves with you. I see my bartender friends who I met a couple weeks before, we chat a bit and I order a beer I've never heard of before. Again, open your world and try new things...this can start somewhere as simple as beer to taking a class with everything inbetween..but for now let's just settle for the beer.

* It was delicious and I sipped it gradually while making my way to the end of the bar where I see a lonely female soul. I ask ""You aren't here by yourself are you?"" She replies with ""Oh god no that would be awful!"" That fast, I'm not there by myself anymore and I've made a friend. I introduce myself and we talk about our loves for certain liquors, her's being bourbon. I like her style...so after simple chatting and some lite added kino, 2 male friends of her's come in and start talking with her. I excused myself and moved my party elsewhere...the new spot was 7 feet away with a couple of HB 8s that strolled in, also friends with the bartenders. I use this to break the ice and find out she is 10 years older than me, obviously I don't let that slow me down. She says ""You come here often?"" then laughs at herself for sounding like a cheesy pickup line. I follow her with a couple awful ones I know of and we share  another laugh. The one that really got her was the 2nd one..I ask her to feel my shirt and ask ""Know what that's made out of? Boyfriend material."" with a small grin. She's lolercoptering all over the place and I said ""Looks like that one works!""...she actually said that was the best line she's ever heard. After 10 minutes or so of talking about the area since we just moved here, I tell her I'm heading to another bar up the street where my good friends are also bartending. I tell them to join along if they'd like and they give a positive response. I exchange numbers with the one I was chatting and make my way out.

* Halfway there I look into another bar and see my old work friend working the door. I go in and bro out with him for about 5 minutes talking about his new gig there and telling funny stories. Tell him I'll hit him up tomorrow if he's not working. I totally won't call him though. I'm such a whore. So I make my way to my destination and the girl taking covers spots me ""Hey you! Sara give him a stamp."" **I'm telling you, making friends with the employees never hurts.** I find my friends who are bartending and grab a drink. These girls are both incredibly attractive so hugging and sharing stories shows more value to the shoobies. I walk to the other side of the bar (it's a big, big place) and see 3 girls in a semi circle, a HB 4, HB 2, and HB 8. I work with the HB 6, since 4 + 2 = 6. Makes sense. I introduce myself and ignore the more attractive one while dancing and kinoing the HB 4. She's actually a lot of fun and was interesting to talk to. Nothing major just school and work, boring stuff. Be careful with these subjects, **you don't want to sound like every other guy interviewing her.** ""Where do you work?"" ""Where do you go to school?"" Instead say something like, ""So how's work/school treating you?"" this will lead her into telling you herself. She might even say ""Do you know what I do?"" and say ""No, you haven't told me yet!"" Make her look a little silly, goddammit.

* As I dance I'm backing myself up into them with my gorgeous ass and they're eating it up. Not literally, that would be gross. As I try to with the HB8 she pushes me away. Whatever, I continue with her friends. After I go to introduce myself to her and she turns away without saying anything. Her friend says ""She's a bitch and think she's hot stuff!"" So I chalk it up in the whatever column and continue dancing. I notice the HB8 eyes start to burn a hole in my back, so I pull at the only string I have to get a reaction from her. ""So your friend tells me you're a bitch..."" I was fully expecting a palm to follow the look on her face but instead she says ""Uhh what?""...the 3 of them are shoulder to shoulder staring at me. Oh damn, I messed up, what do I do now, they don't like me anymore, this  is bad, my life is oveBLAHBLAHBLAH. **Grow a pair.** I don't let that effect me, instead I followed up with ""Only a true friend would say that."" Easily won them back. So after another few minutes I move along and tell them I'm going to see my friends bartending in the next room.

* **SO BACK TO MY TEXT:** I was supposed to meet up with a girl I met a couple weeks ago at the same place I was at. I met up with her last week, got her to my room, only to be turned down for sex. No biggie. So I use this to my advantage. I tell her to meet me and say ""You can be my wingwoman!"" Her reply: ""Haha ok"". I got her.

* She shows up and I take her hand, leading her through the crowd like I own the place while throwing in some dances to get through. I get her a drink from my friend and end up almost grabbing someones drink by mistake. Turns out this guy is a black guy whos built like a linebacker. He goes ""HEY! These are my drinks!"" I retort with ""Well then why aren't you drinking them, MAN!?"" Shortly after that,  we chest bump and I make friends with him and his buddies...turns out it's his birthday and his friends buys us all a couple rounds of shots. After exchanging numbers with him (he was a total bro) they move and in almost one fluid motion without skipping a beat, 2 girls walk up to me, HB7 and HB5. They don't say anything except lock eyes with me, I introduce myself and my wingwoman to them, I talk with the HB7 while my WW talks with the HB5. Damn she's good at this. I talk for a few, hook them up with the bartenders, and exchange my number with her. Honestly this is really all I remember of this interaction. So I grab my friend and tell her ""Let's get out of this spot before I make anymore friends."" She laughs and we move along. I dance with her on the floor, make out here and there, and keeping having a good time with no worries on the outcome. **Just. Having. Fun.**

* Eventually another female friend that's in love with me (we'll call her sara) shows up with her cute friend (we'll call her lara) whom I struck out with last time they were there. So I hug and chat with her while ignoring her friend, then shift all of my focus to her friend, then back to the original. It's all about the frame. **Give them equal amount of attention and don't pick favorites, until it's time to pick favorites...**

* 2am rolls around and I lead my WW outside, we walk across the street and right by a pizza parlor where the HB 4, HB 2, and HB 8 are standing in line. They call out to me and I come inside and say hello, ask them how their night went. I then walk up to the counter past the line of drunks once the owner spots me ""Trooper2442, my man!"" I hug the counter girl who I'm also good friends with and turn to the owner saying ""Hey man hook them up with some slices"" as I put a 5 down on the counter. He happily hands them to me and I walk back to them bearing gifts of pizza. They light up and thank me, I tell them I'm going but not before I exchange numbers with the HB 8. **Bitches love pizza.** I turn to leave and what do ya know...sara and lara come in and spot me. I talk with them for a minute telling them I'm on my way, but not before pulling lara aside for a second and offer her a time out next week. She accepts and I grip up her number as well. What a success. I walk back home with my WW to an empty house and lead her upstairs. The rest is history.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**So what have we learned gentlemen?**

Don't hide your interest in a girl, let her join your party...it moves with you. If you're having an awesome time, eventually people will pull towards you like gravity. It's some magical shit. Also by telling this girl to be my wingwoman, I showed her I'm not hung up and that I'm still living my life and being awesome. She saw what I'm capable of and it made her wet like angel dust.

Fellas, until next time...keep sarging.

=======================================

**TL;DR:** A girl I tried to sleep with turned me down, so I bring her out and ask her to be my wingwoman. I met tons of new, exciting people and shared my awesomeness with everyone like I owned the place. 4 numbers total, 3 girls and a cool guy. Ended up laying a railroad with my wingwoman at the end of the night. Be the party, be fun, be exciting...and people will pull to you like gravity and your party will grow.

1346143359.0,698,self.seduction,yybfq,5 things I would have told myself 3 years ago.,880,182,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yybfq/5_things_i_would_have_told_myself_3_years_ago/,"I used to be fairly active on this subreddit, but felt I learned all I could from the internet about social interaction and got tired of the bullshit rules about what to say, and what not to say/when to call, and when not to call, etc... Tonight I talked to a kid who was like me, a 20 year old virgin, and I gave him a bunch of advice. I think I would have told myself the same stuff if I could go back to that time in my life, so I am posting it here.

1. If you don't think you are a valuable/attractive/cool/etc.. person, you have no fucking chance. e.g. If you go out one night and you look bad(shitty hair, you're fat, etc), that's one things, some girls will get passed that. But if you go out one night and you *think you look bad,*  then you're fucked. If you have emotional baggage, or shit that you dislike about yourself, fix that before you even bother starting trying to attract the opposite sex. You're going to have enough problems overcoming the fucking tidal wave of mixed signals you're going to get and manning up to kiss, let alone disrobe, girls. p.s. get to the fucking gym and /r/fitness, I recommend leangains.
&gt;edit: This doesn't mean don't approach women if you're not already confident. It does mean that you should understand how important confidence is to all of this, and if you're failing, it's probably because you are acting like a pussy.

2. If you don't touch a girl, you'll never kiss her. If you never kiss a girl, you'll never get her into a relationship/bed/finger fucking her at the bus stop. Stop being a pussy and break the touch barrier. Having problems working up the confidence, see point 1.

3. Asking a girl the time in class is not ""approaching a woman."" If you can't strike up a conversation with a girl with a simple ""hey what's up,"" or call a girl attractive to her face, staring her in the eyes, then you are a pussy and deserve to be alone. Having problems working up the confidence, see point 1.
&gt;edit: If you can't ask a girl the time in class, then by all means use that as a stepping stone. But don't ask 100 girls the time and then cry about why they didn't give you their number/flaked.

4. It's not you, it's her. -- Just because one girl didn't like you/your game, doesn't mean all girls won't like you/your game. You'll never make everyone like you, and you'll never make every girl attracted to you. If you waste your time over-analyzing everything you said to some chick wondering why she didn't call/why she won't hang out with you, you're fucked. Have enough confidence to be yourself and say what you want to say. Having problems working up the confidence, see point 1. 
&gt;As an aside, don't listen to bullshit in this sub about things like self-deprecating humor. It's far more ""beta"" to be in your fucking head all night wondering if you should make a joke/say something because some internet people told you it's a no-no than to just take a stab at yourself and get a fucking laugh. Cocky humor is great too, but if you have something to say, say it, but say it confidently. Having problems working up the confidence, see point 1. 
&gt;
&gt;edit: This doesn't mean go do the same dumb shit over and over again. It does mean that if you weren't acting like a pussy and you can't figure out what you did wrong, then forget it happened.

5. Don't fucking lie to women. If you just fucking love poke-mans, then find a girl that likes them too or at least one who isn't stuck up enough to think that makes you a bad person. If you want to be in a relationship with a girl, fucking tell her. If you want to fuck a girl the night you meet her, fucking tell her. This doesn't mean you should go blurting out everything that's in your head every time you have a thought. It does mean that if your actions and dialog don't make your intentions with a girl very clear then you are definitely not a non-pussy and you should see point 1.

Alright, that's all I really feel like writing right now. [Here's a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/rdigd/still_having_confidence_issues_after_the_weight/c44xzn8) to an old post where I went into more depth about how to interact with women.

Everyday people post about what to do in situations. What do I say to her? What do I do after we made eye contact? What comes next?

This is NOT some sort of static game. There isn't a series of moves and an order to make them in. You are not thinking about this in the correct way.

GET YOUR INNER GAME TIGHT FIRST!

New sedditors tend to think that you can learn what to do and get women, that is NOT how it works. It's not a matter of what to do, but of *how* to be.

The quality of this sub is declining imo. I see posts like ""I've made eye contact with her, now what do I do?"". The first step is to become comfortable and proud of *yourself*. 

Work on inner game. There are fantastic links over there-----&gt;

Read them. Seriously. 

If you think about pickup as a set of moves or tactics or techniques, you will have very minimal success. If you're uber afraid to walk up to a a woman and say ""Hi, I'm Philofocus I think you're really cute"" it is most likely because you don't think you're good enough. It's bullshit because you are good enough, but for some reason you don't think you are.

EVERYONE is good enough. EVERYONE can land hot girls, but guys seriously, if you don't think you deserve them, they will pick up on that via sub-communication and lose attraction to you instantly. 

Honestly, focus on the man you want to be, and become that man. Work on improving yourself! Work on improving the things that you hate about yourself until you no longer hate yourself. 

If you knew that a girl loved you and wanted to have your babies before you walked up to say hi, would you feel nervous? Probably not. Apply that to everyone. Everyone loves you, everyone wants your babies. If you don't think that, that means that you think there is a reason why they wouldn't love you. This means that in your eyes, you don't love you. You can't attract women from a scarcity mindset.

Okay, last time. LISTEN and ACTUALLY DO THIS. Work on yourself! Forget about women right now. Look at yourself honestly and think about what it is you don't like about yourself, and work on improving yourself in that regard.

Example from my life:

I made a list of qualities the ideal version of me would have:

1. Solid job in Strategic Planning
1. 185 lbs, 7-10% Body Fat
1. Well groomed all the time (i used to let beards grow etc)
1. House Always clean and smelling good
1. 8-10 outfit wardrobe (horrible with style)
1. Read/Learn something every day

Things I've done

-worked with /r/bodybuilding to design a workout/diet schedule

-enrolled in a business program at college

researched grooming/skincare products and making sure I adhere to grooming/taking care of hygiene very often

-worked with /r/malefashionadvice on where/what to buy clothing wise.

-created a reading list and schedule.



Now I am no where near complete all of these goals. But I have improved on every single one of them. I used to see women in a grocery store that I wanted to approach but didn't for whatever bullshit excuse I made up. After working on JUST me for 6-8 weeks, I find myself in a better mood ALL the time. I'm talking to people more, I'm joking with women more. I love myself more and more, and this translates to increased levels of out-come independence and confidence in every situation. 

If you're here because you want to get laid or a girlfriend in the next 3 months you're here for the wrong purposes imo. Remember, WORK ON YOURSELF FIRST! Get your life in order FIRST. Then worry about women.

I haven't posted or lurked in this subreddit in a while, but right now I feel inspired to share my story and experiences over the past year. **I feel like I've come a long way, and learned some important lessons that I think I should share with others.** What I'm saying is by no means something that hasn't been said before; it's just what seems to have worked for me. I also don't claim to be a master PUA or to be able to sleep with any chick the night I meet her. Nor do I claim to be perfect; I have my shortcomings as well. That said, in the past half year, i've dated way more women than I ever have in my entire life.

**Story:**

Over a year and a half ago, my first real and long-term girlfriend cheated on me.  We got back together for half a year before I called it off.  I was pretty emotionally fucked up for a while, dealing with depression, anxiety, regret and anger. All of this took a few months to get over with. After the relationship, I immediately began reading into seddit material. I hit on many chicks, and dated a chick for a few dates, but they'd be repelled after initial attraction. **I chased women not because I wanted a partner in my life, but because I needed someone to fill a gap in life and make me happy.  Skip forward 6 months later, and women have been coming into my life with little to no effort.**  In the past half-year, I've gone on dates with at least 12 women,  and I've slept with half of them.  I have a FWB for a few months now, and she's aware I'm dating other women.

**Reading:**

**I highly recommend Mark Manson's Models.** Definitely worth the read. I think truly implementing the advice in that book will take you a long way. Although, he emphasizes always appearing to be less committed. IMO, being straight up and authentic about how you feel is better. She's likely feeling the same way you do. 

**Some lessons learned:**

**1) Women are people too**

It seems a bit obvious. This isn't going to be some feminist diatribe. The point is they aren't objects to be manipulated. Hell, they're probably more in a rush to find the right person than we are. **They're human beings just like we are, with feelings of happiness, loneliness, desire, horniness, confusion, hope, ambition etc. If you treat them like people, rather than someone to play emotional chess with, you'll do better in relating to them and building meaningful relationships.** A lot of guys are bitter about women, but it's a natural reaction from previous unsuccessful and painful relationships. Manipulating someone into liking you will only work for so long. Besides that, if they don't want to be in your life, why bother? Manipulation implies that you believe you're not good enough as you are to get her. This leads me to: 

**2) Develop the lifestyle that you want to live**

You're living the life you want to lead. You are developping your career, your education, your hobbies, you're getting fit, trying something new, socializing, developing friendships with guys and girls. You're constantly improving yourself and reaching for the kind of life you imagine you deserve. That said, things in the here-and-now are not that bad. You're happy where you are, but you want more.

**Look at yourself in the mirror. Would someone want to go out with you, fuck you, or be in a relationship with you? Would someone want to join you for the ride? If the answer is no, you better change that.** You can't expect to get anything better than your female equivalent. How do you find that female equivalent?

**3) Be authentic**

Being authentic  (and hence vulnerable) will allow you to build relationships with people that you actually mesh well with.

Don't put on confidence. A lot of guys do this. It comes off as douchey, cocky and insecure.  **Be confident. Be true to yourself and to others.  Express yourself truthfully, boldly and clearly. Know what you want and go after it. The things you like are awesome because you like them.** Other people don't like them? Well that's too bad, they probably haven't properly developped an appreciation for them. 

Tell people that you're angry with them, that you appreciate what they've done, or that you like what someone is wearing. But don't say these things expecting anything in return. Express them because you're expressing yourself. Tell the girls you like that you're attracted to that you're attracted to them. But don't be needy about getting anything back. There's nothing that turns someone on more than being desired. But before you tell them how you feel:

**4) Make moves**

**You need to act early and when the time is right.** Wait too long, and attraction will die. Make a move too early, and you'll get rejected. You also need to act before she begins to see you as just a friend. Trust me, no girl worth your time will go out with only you just without being somewhat interested in you. Make sure you escalate the kino ladder (this has been written about elsewhere, which I won't get into here). The further you go with a girl physically, the more likely she's going to believe that she actually likes you. Basically, her mental state will readjust to her actions.

I like to go caveman when I make moves. When I'm just feeling that strong sexual attraction, I won't even think, I'll just go for it. I have a 100% success rate this way. You can ask if they want to kiss you / if you can kiss them, but that leads to awkward responses.

**Have the balls to attempt the move. If you get turned down, there's no loss at all. The girl will likely be flattered.**

**5) Women are the ocean, men are the sun**

Despite what some may say, there are some pretty generalizable differences between men and women. Most importantly, women are a lot more emotional. They may test you, be unsure of you, manipulate you, go hot/cold. At the end of the day, be true to yourself, know what you want and don't get too caught up in their emotional swings. **Like the sun, be the stable and enduring figure that you are. Take the high road, and they'll realize that and appreciate it later.**  If a girl is *really* unstable, manipulative and needy, it's probably better that you don't have her in your life anyway.

**6) Feeling frustrated? Take a break.**

I find that women come into my life when I've decided to stop actively pursuing them.  When I invest into myself, lead a good life and have fun, they come to me.

**7) Noone is perfect, but some people are better for you than others**

**Everyone is flawed, and no girl you will ever meet will match everything you ever wanted in a mate.** If you do find someone that seems absolutely perfect, you're likely idealizing them and not seeing the for who they actually are. Accept other people's flaws. It seems we're attracted to imperfections in others.  That said, recognize where to draw an acceptable limit. If a chick will cheat on her boyfriend with you, she'll do the same to you. If a chick will leave her boyfriend for you, she'll leave you for another guy. If a girl talks shit about all of her exs, she'll talk shit about you too. If all her relationships are dramatic, problematic and unsatisfying, it's likely she's the source of the problem. Find a partner worthy of sharing your life.

1343074749.0,675,self.seduction,x1819,Guide to having a hot girlfriend,868,193,211,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x1819/guide_to_having_a_hot_girlfriend/,"Having a hot girlfriend is different than having a not-so-hot girlfriend.  If you're like me, you have been out picking up women for a while, but found someone that's just so awesome, cool, and attractive that you decide to make her your girlfriend.  This guide is about what to do AFTER you get the hot girl to agree to be your girlfriend.  I haven't seen a lot of guides on how to handle this situation, so here's my stab at how to keep her attracted and keep the relationship flowing smoothly.  It includes some observations I've made, but feel free to add your own:

* Don't be needy.  Ever.  Even for a second.  Hot girls can sense neediness and they respond negatively to it.  This is especially true when you're in a relationship with one.  Don't beg to spend time with her, don't fish for compliments, and don't call/text too much.  Give her space; this shows her you are secure in your relationship, and she will respect you for that.  If she decides to travel or go out with friends without you, let her do that, and go do your own thing for a while.  If you aren't with her and you feel yourself getting needy, leave your phone at home and go do something without it for a few hours, even if it's just going for a run or going to get a beer by yourself.

* Continue to demonstrate abundance and value.  Have lots of friends that you spend time with.  Provide value in every situation.  Make memories that you can share. 

* Don't let her be your purpose.  She's there because you're a complete and centered person, that's what attracted her to you in the first place.  Don't let this slide.  Have hobbies, business pursuits, passion for something besides her.  This will allow you to keep her respect.

* Other women will hit on you when you are with her.  Often, this will occur when a woman comes up to you and says 'your girlfriend/date/friend is really pretty,' or something similar.  To be clear (and it took my girlfriend to point this out), this is not them hitting on your girlfriend, *this is them hitting on you*, albeit indirectly.  Women, especially ones less attractive than your girlfriend, get insecure, and they will try to put chinks in your relationship armor.  Don't let them do this.  Deflect and ignore, but be cordial and maybe set them up with your single friends if they're around.  Having a hot girl with you conveys loads of value and women respond to this, it's their nature.

* Men will hit on her when you are with her.  You need to step up to this.  Most of the time, the dudes that hit on your girlfriend will be total chodes and it's likely that your girlfriend has been dealing with these types for years.  She knows how to handle / deflect them, but if they get annoying or clingy or creepy, you need to step in and make some kind of move, physical or verbal, to indicate she's with you.  Be the alpha and befriend, ignore, or tool on the guy (tool on him only after you've tried the first two).  However, be on the lookout for a signal from her (especially panicky eyes that are scanning the room or looking straight at you - it looks reactive).  If you see a signal like this, step in right away.  One time, I saw this happening and literally pushed another girl we were with between some dude and my girlfriend (in a playful way).  The dude backed off instantly and my girlfriend came up to me and I got a very appreciative makeout.

* A hot girlfriend will test your testicular fortitude on a frequent basis.  For me, this usually comes in one of two ways.  First, she will make some snarky or bitchy comment to undercut you in a small way.  Not a mean comment, but something borderline funny/snarky/bitchy to see how you respond.  You can do one of three things that seem to work to keep her respect and keep her knowing you are in charge and centered: a) ignore and don't respond - change the thread entirely, b) reward her in some fashion - a kiss, a squeeze of the hand, a smile.  Choice (b) may seem ridiculous and counterintuitive, but it works, I promise.  Getting rewarded for being bitchy short circuits her brain: she doesn't get a negative reaction from you (in fact it gets a positive one), so she realizes you aren't affected or made insecure by her comment, so she backs off and doesn't do it again.

She can also test you by trying to get lots of things from you.  You have to draw a line in order to show you are not a pushover.  Be nice and do things for her (she's your girlfriend and you - presumably - care about and respect her), but don't be too nice.  It's a fine line to walk.  Let me give you an example.  My girlfriend wanted a ride home from a work event, and doesn't have a car.  I agreed to pick her up.  She later asked if I would take her two interns to their respective houses, kinda far from where I live.  I straight up said no to this, but agreed that I could give them all a ride to a bar after and we could all hang out.  Nice, but not too nice.

* Show her off and be proud to be with her.  Most guys never get girls like this.  Take her out dancing, to bars, have her meet your friends.  This lets her know she's important to you and keeps her in the social loop.  She likes being out and about, I promise.  

* You don't need to buy her stuff.  Buy a drink or two when you're out, but you should be equal partners in who pays for things.  If the expectation becomes that you pay for dinner, then you become the guy who just has the hot girl because he has money to spend on her.  If you travel together, you get the flights, she gets the hotels, etc.   Give gifts sometimes, but make them meaningful and spontaneous.  If you are a pushover and pay for everything, she will lose respect.  

* Tap. That. Ass.  Seriously, she loves sex and you should be doing it frequently, improving your skills at it, and figuring out how you can have better sex together.  Dominate sometimes and do what you like doing, but be sure to keep her satisfied.  No one ever broke up because the sex was just too good.

* Overall, keep it spontaneous and fun, but with a punch of drama once in a while.  Women don't just like the super happiness bit all the time.  Once in a while, a little drama doesn't hurt.  Doesn't have to be anything serious, just something where you come off looking awesome.  For example: we were grabbing the last train home the other night, she was able to get on and I, (two seconds behind her) got the door shut in my face.  I literally screamed at the conductor to let me on, and he did, I got on the train with my hands in the air like Rocky and I made out with her in front of everyone.  The entire train was cheering (this was a 1:30 train home from the bars).  Be her champion.

* If she fishes for compliments, don't take the bait.  She gets enough positive reinforcement (especially about her looks) elsewhere.  But, offer up spontaneous and serious compliments that you truly mean.  If she acts a way you like, tell her.  If she's being bratty, treat her like you would treat a bratty little sister.

* Improve yourself and encourage her to improve, she will respect and love you for it.  There's always a harder workout to do, a run you can go on together, a new skill to learn, a new activity to try.  

I'm sure this guide is incomplete, and my only disclaimer is that some of these things only work for VERY hot women.  Minimum of a 9 for some of this stuff.  Otherwise you're just going to end up hurting her emotionally.  Some women who are very attractive have never heard a negative thing in their life, and rarely get told 'no.'  You're going to be the guy that doesn't put her on a pedestal.  Do this, and she'll stay attracted to you for the duration of your relationship.

EDIT: BadGirlThrowAway brought up a solid point, and I want to clarify.  Don't confuse neediness with being emotionally open.  These are two different things.  Being emotionally honest in a relationship is vitally important.  Neediness ruins relationships, emotional honesty sustains them.

Know that the night will be good. It really doesn't matter what happens, your life will still be the same. Your family will still love you, your friends will still like you.

But, for the night to be real great, you have to do something! If you're going out to wait for something to happen... Yeah, like I said, your life will still be the same when you go back home, but you will feel like a loser, I think we all here know how this feels likes, and it's not good.

In every choice you do, you're taking a risk. If you choose to stay by the wall looking at that cute girl, if you choose to wait for the perfect moment, if you choose to drink a lot or every other choice that you make. It is a risk. You're taking the risk of maybe that cute girl look at you and smile, the risk of maybe that some girl collide with you and you two start talking, the risk of you being drunk and finding a girl drunk enough to make out with you. I'm talking with my personal experience here, and I've already choose to take these risks, and all I've learned  was: Good things don't happen for those who wait. Good things happen for those who act!

""The biggest risk is not taking any risks.""

If you want to have an awesome night out, the most important thing you have to know is that YOU have make the night awesome. YOU HAVE TO MOVE! Get out of your comfort zone! Feel that awkward feeling in your stomach! Try to get slapped in the face! JUST. DO. SOMETHING.

Watch this(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlWrFgIR6CU) and this(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBkMtfd7p8) some hours before going out.



**BEING AN ATTRACTIVE MALE AND SOME GAME CONCEPTS**

- Talk loud and slowly.
- Smile. (:
- Take pauses when talking. Sexual tension relys on the pauses that are made. And don't be affraid of taking pauses even when answering. Some guys thinks that you need to have instantaneous replys for everything girls say, but you acctually don't. Sometimes when I don't know how to answer something, I just think for a momment, as long as you are comfortable, the girl is comfortable too, and you will see that there is no such thing as awkward silences.
- People feel what you feel. Again: as long as you are comfortable, the girl is comfortable too.
- Have a strong eye contact. Look people in their eyes!
- Always kino!
- Be unreactive. Don't let other people's drama(or whatever they do/say) affect you and your vibe.
- You are enough. Act like a guy who has 10 women in his house wanting him at the moment, and is only going out to have/add fun with interactions with even other girls.
- Be proactive. Don't wait for good things to happen to you. Make the good things happen. There is no perfect moment, you take the moment and make it perfect. 
- The 3 seconds rule. Look and approach!
- Talk with lots of girls! Don't focus just in the pretty ones. This helps to build momentum and there is always a good chance that some non-attractive girl is in a group of people with some attractive one.
- The triangular look. Look to the left eye, look to the right eye and look to the mouth.
- Be the party, no girl wants to meet a sad and less value guy. They always want something better. They can see in your eyes and in your body language if you're having a good night. And they aways wants the guy who is having a good night. 
- Don't care about the outcome. When your purpose is only to have fun, you will get more girls. Trust me.
- Don't try/Don't give a fuck. With ""don't try"" I mean, don't look like a guy who is always trying to convey or get something in the interaction. You acctually want to convey and get something, but you have to do this in a smooth way. This is some different way of saying ""Be unreactive"".

I need to [Rant],809,144,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1efvn5/excuse_me_for_a_minute_i_need_to_rant/,"Almost a year ago, I joined this subreddit under a different username.  It was after a horrible night on the town in Boston, and I didn't know why I was in a huge rut with the ladies.  Joining this subreddit was the watershed moment of my life, and it was the best decision I ever made.  My first three months after joining this subreddit, I spent all my time simultaneously fixing my inner and outer game.  Whether it was **going to the gym** ; **studying** RSD - Gambler - Mystery -AFC Adam - James Marshall - David DeAngelo, and countless others ; **proper dieting** ; **reading** - No More Mr. Nice Guy - How to Win Friends and Influence People - The Book of Pook - The Game - Sex God Method - **All OF THE SIDEBAR** - **ALL OF THE TOP 200 /R/SEDUCTION POSTS** - and countless other blogs and books ; **changing my wardrobe** ; **going out a ridiculous 5 nights a week** ;  **meditating** ; setting realistic **goals** for my PUA progress ; doing **kegels** ; **teaching my friends seduction and sarging** (I introduced them to the community about 4 months ago after they finally asked what the hell happened to me).  Once I changed my username to Project-Me, I was already in full swing and the past 9 months have been absolutely nuts.  I am not going to try to tell you how many girls I've slept with or anything like that cause this shit is anonymous, who cares!  You either believe me or you don't right?


My rant starts here.  This subreddit has evolved rapidly in both members and content over the past 9 months, and thus completely lost its identity.  Outergame is mercilessly downvoted, Most FRs are about getting number closes or just ""going out and having a good time"", and the biggest of all is that inner game is confused with Natural Game and is the only thing people will collectively acknowledge is beneficial (Note, this is for the most part –I’m not trying to make a blanket statement).  


People here have different goals, some are looking for ""love"", some have taken the ""Red Pill"", and there are lots of people in between!  However, we have lost sight of what seduction is, and are now more of a general motivation and inner game subreddit.  No matter what you are looking for in a girl there is one thing that is a common truth.  Seduction has many road maps, some strategies work for some people, and some work for others!  Personally, for my first 6 months I went with a crazy strategy, one that was not acknowledged as being a “current” option and you know what it worked!  I mapped out every interaction with the same basic principles and lines/ techniques that worked for me.  My abilities and success gradually increased and by the end of my first 6 months my success was through the roof!  Sometimes I still revert to it just to warm up and get in “God-Mode”.  I am posting it here just so people can get an idea of what I mean:

1) EYE CONTACT

""So, have you killed anyone recently?""

----------------------------------------------------------

Yep, that really happened for six months, and I still use it.  Crazy huh.

There are so many different types of game, and the only one getting any press around here is natural/ inner game.  I am calling it that because honestly it is a shell of both.  Each day this subreddit has new subscribers, and they are only being introduced to what's hot this week.  Inner game isn't the only thing you need to succeed, it's important, but it is not the only thing you need to improve at pick up.   People need an open mind when it comes to seduction.  We need to realize that some people are going to be “narcissists” and others are going to be “Nice Guys”, some people are going to want routines, and others are going to want natural game – whatever strategy works for you, but people need to be introduced to it, and right now they aren’t able to learn it!  As crazy as it sounds, we need to have an open identity where all trains of seduction thought are accepted.


Here is what I would like to propose.  To help with the inordinate amount of down votes that comments receive when someone disagrees, I think it would help if you can only downvote if you comment on the persons comment that you are downvoting. Therefore, having to explain yourself for the downvote, and taking accountability for thus vote.  


**For instance, if person A wanted to downvote person B, person A would have to comment on person B before being allowed to downvote, thus creating accountability and having to explain his (or her) reasoning.**  


What this will do is open dialogue instead of having “white knights” “Red Pillers” and “PUA Newbies” downvoting without having the proper knowledge or having an extreme bias where they will downvote anything that doesn’t agree with their current worldview.  I don’t even know if this is possible, but if it is, it may just save this subreddit.  


I love this subreddit.  I am not trying to sound like a cocky prick or asshole. I just don’t want to see it die.  It literally changed my life, and I know it can still fulfill other’s dreams as well if it receives the right TLC.

""No, she is dating some guy"". Ok, I shrug and just plan on having fun the rest of the night. The whole night I treat her no different than the rest of my friends at the table, compared to the other guys who were either a) with a girl already, or b) flirting with her heavily. End result? She starts kino'ing the hell out of me, stealing my hat and taking pictures with it - at one point a creepy guy was hanging around our table so she grabs may arms and wraps them around her so that it looks like we are together. 

End of night I say bye, and leave - knowing full well how she was eyeing me and hugging on me that I could have # closed, but she has a boyfriend right? I don't deal with that sort of mess.

5 minutes after leaving my friend messages me because this girl is all asking about me, etc. - turns out she wasn't dating anyone anymore, so my friend gave her my number.

Emotions Later"" : Part Two of: Some men smell like ""White Picket Fences"" and some men smell like ""Sex and Sin""",822,154,163,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yo0d6/sex_now_emotions_later_part_two_of_some_men_smell/,"*(A quick note: this is not about finding random women to hook up with.  Getting a piece of ass is relatively easy and requires almost no skill or effort. This is for men who don't know how to build/maintain attraction and bridge into LTR, men who find themselves ""friend-zoned"", or turning women off by failing to understand how to escalate the relationship.)*

The staple of the PUA ideology is that women are attracted to men who are able to elicit strong emotions in them. Point-to-fact, the problem most men have when dealing with women romantically is that we try to appeal to the logic in them when trying to show what a great catch we are: 

*""I'm this. I'm that. I have this. I have that. I'll treat you like this instead of like that. Why do you waste time with guys who act like that, when you have a man who'll treat you like this sitting right in front of you?""*

And even if you manage to open her eyes to how you are a great guy, guess where you end up: THE FRIENDZONE! But why? Why would she acknowledge you're a great guy, and an amazing catch, and then say something like *""You're too good for me.""* or *""Someday, you're going to make some lucky girl really happy.""* or even worse *""I don't want to ruin our friendship.""*  

**WHY?!?!?**

It's because she doesn't **FEEL** anything for you. Sure, on paper, you're amazing, but she doesn't **FEEL** it.

I'm a great guy. I'm smart. I'm articulate. I have a great sense of humor. I'm very outgoing and adventurous. I'm kind and compassionate, romantic and sensitive. I'm great with kids and pets. Mothers love me. Fathers respect me. I work hard and play harder. I'm well built, attractive, a sexy beast, and I'm amazing in bed.

And how much time do you think I spend trying to convince a woman of any of these things? 

**ABSOLUTELY ZERO!**

I'm not a fucking checklist of qualities. I'm not trying to live up to her standards. I'm not trying to prove my worth. I know I'm awesome! I'm trying to give her the opportunity to figure it out on her own. 

In the meantime... I'm trying to take off those panties with my teeth.

And here's why:

If we follow the mantra that women are attracted to men who elicit strong emotions in them, then we have to understand the way emotions work. Now, I'm not going to argue about the existence of ""love at first sight"". Personally, I've never had that chick-flick moment, where you see a girl and time slows down, and the lights dim, except for the halo of radiance just above her head. And when she speaks, its sounds like angels in chorus, or the strum of a harp. And she looks at me and smiles, and my knees get weak, and my heart skips a beat, and I know, in my very soul, that this is the woman I'm going to love for the rest of my life.

It would be fucking awesome if it did... but it's never happened.

Know what happens when I see a really hot girl?  My dick twitches.  Somewhere deep inside of me; something primal and ancient, stands up and says **""She is good for breeding. I must bed her.""**  I don't think *""Wow. She looks like a great person. I wonder if she'd like to be friends.""* I don't wonder what it would be like to sit across from her at dinner. I don't wonder what her hobbies are. I don't wonder what her parents will think of me.

My first, instinctive thoughts of her are gaining carnal knowledge of her body. It's not even something I CHOOSE to think about. It just pops in there.

Does that mean I objectify women? Does it imply that I don't respect them. Does it insist that I look at women as nothing more than sexual objects of desire.

Absolutely not. 

It means that my instincts, my very DNA, are layered with a drive to seek out women who I find physically appealing and procreate.

But what most men fail to realize is that women have the EXACT SAME REACTION to us.

When she sees you walking towards her, she's not wondering if you're a good listener, or if you like cats instead of dogs, or if you'll get along with her mom. She's waiting for her body, her instincts to react to you. She's waiting for that urge to surface, for that itch she wants to scratch.  She's waiting to **feel** it.

And if she gave you contact information or asks you for yours, **she feels it.**

(Now, it's a little known fact that if a woman agrees to go out with you, she's attracted to you, and on some level, even subconsciously, she has already resigned to sleep with you. There's just the matter of logistics to work out before the main event.)

That said, and following the ""strong emotions"" mantra, it makes perfect sense to build upon the first, instinctive emotion and escalate: The physical, or Sexual, attraction.

If she's out with you, she wants you. It may not be ""Oh my good, I want to tear his cloths off and screw him right here!"", but it's, at the bare minimum, ""He's kinda cute. Let's see where this goes.""  What we men tend to do is start trying to appeal to her logic and display qualities we think she would find appealing in a potential mate.

We pander and pamper. We try to be perfect gentlemen and chivalrous knight. We flatter. We spoil. We emasculate ourselves trying to demonstrate why she should want us. 

And she gets bored, those feelings dwindle, and instead of becoming **""Her Man""**, we become *""Her friend""*.

What we should be focusing on is making her FEEL that way about us. And since you already know she's attracted to you, why not focus on increasing that physical attraction?

*I know you like me. My job is to make you like me more. Make you desire me. Make you lust for me. And rather than list off reasons why you should like me, I'm going to focus on making you WANT me. I'm going to turn you on. I'm going to entice you. I'm going to tease you. I'm going to make you FEEL something for me!*

When I date a girl, I'm holding her hand as soon as we get to where we're going. I kiss the back of her hand and comment on her scent and/or taste. I put my arm around her. If we have to wait in line, I hug her. I keep the physical contact constant and frequent. And I kiss her. REALLY Kiss her. Not at the end of the date, but at the point when I feel like we're ready.

One the second date, I test her physically. I might pinch her boobs or slap her ass (if i haven't done so one the first date). I tug her hair and whisper naughty things in her ears. I make sexual innuendos every chance I get. I let her know that I'm attracted to her. That I desire her. That I want her.

And then I step back and let her come to me. This shows me she's just as interested and willing to make the effort to get us there.

By the third date, sexy times ensue.

*(Now, this is my own personal schedule and not something I suggest men try to adopt. You're level of progression will vary based on they type of women you go out with. Don't pressure a girl into anything trying to fulfill a pre-determined time table. This is what works for me and the women I deal with.)*

The point is to let her know you're interested. That you crave her, and to find ways to make her crave you just as much, if not more. Not mentally or logically, but physically and emotionally.  Make her **feel** for you.

Now, I'm not saying you should be all about ""Let's go to bed!"" from the get go. Point-to-fact, this is probably the quickest way to turn a woman off. ""Sex first. Emotions later"" isn't about the quickest way to get a girl into bed. It's about escalating using feelings instead of pandering to logic.

*""But what's wrong with taking your time and really getting to know a girl instead of focusing on the physical?""*

Honestly, nothing. And everything.

See, again, the problem most men face is that while they are spending time ""Getting to know someone"", they aren't producing any type of feelings or emotions in the woman. She calls you when she's board, she texts you to see how you're doing, she goes out with you when she hasn't already made plans, she tells you about the creep that hit on her at the gym, and she starts to see the sweet, funny, awesome guy, who's a really great **FRIEND**.

But the guy that gets her hot... the guy she finds herself thinking about when she should be studying or working... the guy she's frustrated with because he won't return her calls... the guy she had that erotic dream about... the guy that kissed her and made her feel like her panties were ablaze... THAT GUY!! That's the guy she cancels plans to spend time with. That's the guy she wants. That's the guy she desires. The guy who makes her FEEL strong emotions.

And now that those emotions are there, now that she FEELS something for you, now you can show her how awesome a guy you are. Now you can run down your checklist. You can show her how sweet and thoughtful you are. How romantic and considerate. How trustworthy and dependable. How funny and outgoing. How great you are with kids and pets.

And when all that ""clicks"" in her head and she realizes what a great catch you are, she won't be saying *""Someday you'll make a lucky girl really happy.""* She'll be saying *""I'm a lucky girl. He makes me really happy.""*

The bottomline is to focus less on trying to tell her, or even show her how awesome you are, and focus more on making her FEEL how awesome you are. And the sad truth is that sometimes, the fastest way to a woman's heart, is in the bed.

**TL;DR: Don't try to increase a womens attraction to you by appealing to her logically. Increase her attraction to you by appealing to her emotions and desires. And the easiest way is often physical or sexual. After all, if she wasn't attracted to you, she wouldn't be going out with you.**",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1345756628.0,,,True,t3_yo0d6,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yo0d6/sex_now_emotions_later_part_two_of_some_men_smell/,

Little back story: Currently a senior in college, was awkward in high school, got my first girlfriend and lost my virginity in sophomore year of college. almost 2 years later, we broke up. My college has an almost 2:1 ratio of girls to guys, but I was getting nothing. 2 months after we break up, I find you wonderful people. In regards to the FR I am writing about, by this time I have read [How To Win Friends &amp; Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1439167346/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357675023&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people), [The Game](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Penetrating-Secret-Society-Artists/dp/0060554738/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357675161&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Game), and [No More Mr. Nice Guy](http://www.amazon.com/No-More-Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/0762415339/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357675209&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=no+more+mr+nice+guy), in addition to what feels like half of seddit.

**The Night** I went over to one of my friends houses and was hanging out there when one of them mentions that there is a party nearby. I am immediately excited to go, but nobody besides the guy who mentioned it is even slightly interested. Their loss.

**The Party** I arrived at the party, no idea whose house it is, and I find it pleasantly crowded. By this point, I am 3 beers in, and I have 2 more in my coat and a full flask of rum. I'm also super excited about the party, because this is the first party I have been to since I started on my path to seduction. Needless to say, I am not simply bringing my A game, I'm delivering it next day air with full shipping insurance. 

The moment I step in the room, I'm remembering my [Alexander Technique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgplXmILzoQ), maintaining a smile, and kinoing every person I touch within 10 seconds of meeting them. I flirt with EVERY girl at the party. Anyone above a 5 is fair game. There are a bunch of little premade christmas present ribbons, the kind with tape on the bottom, on the table in one room. I was flirting with an HB6, and after using the [shoulder spin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEitVCksdzk), she laughs and sticks one to my chest. Bam, now I have a fun way to kino girls. I love the shoulder spin from the How To Kino series because it isolates, involves a good level of kino, and is funny. I place the ribbons on girls either when I'm opening or exiting, saying ""You are a special present"" or something silly like that, and they all love it. 

**The Approach** after about 45 minutes of hugging people I recognize, flirting with girls whose names I won't remember, and completely blowing the minds of the few longtime friends that showed up (""Holy shit LordG, you are on fire tonight, what is up with you!?""), a girl catches my eye. HB8, long wavy red hair, big doe eyes, cute face. Can't tell her body to well because of a huge ugly sweater she is wearing (Damn Portland fashion!). She's in a 4 set with some of the girls I talked to earlier, and so I just join up and start talking. I have them all laughing at my comments and jokes, and I turn to her, lightly touch her forearm, and simply say ""So who are you?"" She says her name and I quiz myself by seeing if I can remember the names of everyone in the set. I'm not doing this quietly, I'm making myself the center of attention while I do it and smile the whole time. If I mess up, I completely own it and laugh about it. I actually almost get everyone's name right, mostly because they all begin with the same letter. HB8 and I keep talking, and her friends start to wander off, but I keep her focused on me using my [body language](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/eznlt/its_not_that_he_seduces_women_he_seduces_everyone/).

**The Seduction** Once it's just her and I, I dialed it up. Kino on her hands and I kept the conversation [flowing](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ovaar/since_seductionreview_went_down_i_thought_id/). At one point, when conversation slowed down and I she turned her head away, I lightly placed my fingers on her cheek (didn't use my whole hand by placing the palm, just used my fingers), and turned her head back to me, saying [""I'm much more interesting than whatever is over there, honey](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vqbvw/fr_the_rubix_cube_of_fcloses/). OOOOOOOOH BOY did her eyes light up. It was mostly surprise, but there was a definite spark of attraction. Her body language completely shifted after that. She still wasn't initiating any kino, but she was excited. We talked for 2-3 more minutes, when I decided that I should go for it. I turned to her and said ""Alright, I guess I should go try and find my friends and see what they are up to, [but before I go I'm going to kiss you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14g59a/fr_boring_is_better_f_close/)"" Immediately when I finish saying this, I go in for the kiss. Didn't give her time to say anything, but as I was moving in, I saw a smile spread across her face and she managed to say the first syllable of ""okay"" before I kissed her. I made sure to pull back **before** she tried to, gave her a wink, and turned around and walked away.

**The Celebration** I immediately went outside and jumped like a lunatic. I felt like a GOD. Then I immediately realized that I had completely forgot her name. I spend the next 20 minutes ""nonchalantly"" wandering around the house in a desperate bid to find her. I found her above the garage, then walked up and put my hand around her waist. Her eyes lit up and she began dragging me around the house trying to find an isolated area. I could have pushed her against a wall and made out with her anywhere, but I was entertained by our search. We headed to the garage, where a few people were playing the weirdest drinking game I have ever seen. The floor was **covered** in nails, and there was a stump in the middle of the garage. I can tell she is nervous, but completely vibrating with excitement. Within 30 seconds the garage is empty save for the two of us, and I grab her and start making out with her. On the floor. That is covered in nails.  

**The Number &amp; Ride Home** So after 15 minutes of this I realized I really need her name, and I sure as shit don't want this to be a one time deal. So I take my phone from my pocket, hand it to her, and say [""You know what to do.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/10mve2/fr_class_game_number_close/) She is confused and asks me what I mean, but I don't answer and simply spank her. She gives me her number, and I look at my phone and thank god she put her name in too. While we are making out, she says ""I'm surprised that I'm doing this. I thought I was going to hook up with a girl tonight."" Apparently, she is bisexual and wasn't looking for a guy at the party. We keep making out and discuss going back to my place, but I didn't push it hard enough and instead, we end up hooking up in the garage for 2 hours. No sex, but we certainly had fun. By 1:45, I offer to take her back to campus and she agrees, but she wants to find her friends first. As we wander around the house looking for her friends, every few minutes I throw her against the wall and make out with her to keep the tension between us high. Eventually, she finds her friends, they decide to walk back, but the girl stays with me. I also give one of my friends and his FWB a ride back to campus. For almost the whole ride back, they are making out in the back seat and I'm teasing HB8 in the front. When I get to campus, I drop her off and tell her I'll see her soon, and she agrees. Just before she steps out of the car, she turns to me and says ""by the way, my chin is raw now."" Apparently, we made out so hard and so long that my facial hair had rubbed her chin raw. And I shaved completely at 5pm that day. 


**Aftermath &amp; Highlights**

* We are confirmed friends with benefits, and have hooked up multiple times since then.
* I used the present ribbons as a novel way to initiate kino. Use your surroundings and be able to improvise. 
* Make yourself the party, be a source of happiness and excitement rather than looking for it. Emotion is infectious.
* Seeking permission for flirting will get you nowhere.
* Learn to read body language! It is possibly the most important part of communicating. If I hadn't been able to read her, I would have had no idea how she felt about what I was doing. 
* Don't save your seduction skills for one person. Seduce the room or the whole set and you will be successful.
* By seducing and charming one person can validate you to anyone they know. (This could be phrased so much better, but you get the idea)
* Don't worry about whether or not you are ""in state."" If you are, you will know. You can feel it coming.

**Edit:** Holy shit, I was not expecting a response this good. I thought that people would be turned off by the huge length (over 8000 characters), but you PUAs-in-training proved me wrong. This can be you. I had only begun my transformation two weeks before this FR. THIS IS POSSIBLE.

 Unfortunately, since winter break started for me on december 16th, I've been back at my parent's house and there haven't been as many opportunities as I would like for improving my game. So after hitting this peak, I haven't kept my momentum as much as I should have.

I'm your competition, &amp; whether you like it or not, you're being compared to me and guys like me. I don't have noticeable flaws, emotional hangups, or needy tendencies. When I get blown out, I feel sorry for what she doesn't know she is missing. When I close, it's expected, and when I'm gone, women play dj scribbles while they're thinking of me. 

While you are playing video games, I am lifting. While you're picking out your outfit, I'm doing crunches so I can take my clothes off. While you're at your job, I'm at my career. While you're hanging in your parents basement, I'm paying off my mortgage. While you're questioning whether or not she likes you, I've already found out. When you're pining over the one that got away, I'm making her laugh and horny but walking away because she's not that interesting. While you're pissing around on the internet, I'm emailing, texting and calling all the women you're too much of a pussy to try and attract. 

And the worst part is, you probably hold women in higher regard than I do, and treat them with more respect, care, and kindness than I ever have. Do you hate me? You should, because I'm the guy she wishes your text was from. I'm the guy that makes you feel 2 inches tall, I'm the reason that women have their emotions guarded, and I'm the guy you'd punch out if you weren't such a little bitch.

If you can't find enough motivation to change your life just by thinking about all the beautiful ladies you don't know yet, you can find that motivation by thinking about me, blowin it on the love of your life's face, then not calling her. You've got to be better, work harder, and do more to be her hero. 

Or you can just skip your workout today, stay home tonight &amp; jerk off. Please do, because that makes it so much easier for me and all the other assholes like me that are doing what needs done to impress the fairer sex.

1374439951.0,647,self.seduction,1irp11,[FEMALE PERSPECTIVE] Three examples of approaches I have experienced: what worked and what didn't work.,866,219,176,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1irp11/female_perspective_three_examples_of_approaches_i/,"So I’m a long-time lurker with a vagina and friends of the vagina-bearing persuasion and I thought I’d give an (as it turns out alarmingly extensive) breakdown of a few approaches we’ve been on the receiving end of in the past few weeks. For reference, I’m a student-age female based in the UK, and these interactions all took place in popular central London clubs on Saturday nights. I know you’re not supposed to ask the fish but I’m hoping that at least some of this stuff might be useful for some.. :)









**Approach  1**




I was alone, walking back to my friends from the bar, when HG7 'bumped into me'. He apologised (with his hand on my shoulder for emphasis) and segued immediately into introducing himself and asking my name whilst maintaining contact with my shoulder. As we talked, he **maintained eye contact despite the loud club environment** (i.e. didn't just talk into my ear) and let his hand drop from my shoulder, to my arm, to around my waist. This guy was running textbook game, but I didn't care. If a girl knows you're gaming her and she's attracted to you (i.e. your game is working), she gives but not one fuck.


After a few more seconds of talking to him, I K-closed and moved on. I tend to be fairly impatient when it comes to closing, but I don't know how typical this is of most girls, so it might not be wise to rush the kiss this fast as a rule. I think that, certainly in club game, **this kind of timeframe is acceptable (and even desirable) as long as the girl is showing a reasonable level of interest** (and by sticking around, smiling and remaining engaged, I was giving all the IOIs), but this guy was probably used to having to build a little more comfort before going for the close.


ANYWAY. Later on throughout the night, I saw HG7 at several points dancing and generally being very high energy with different groups (guys and girls). I feel like **the fact that I saw him engaging with a couple of mixed or all guy sets among the female sets was important in reassuring me that he wasn't just a loser whose sole purpose was to hit on girls**, and that he was actually here to have fun too. 


After a bit of this he bounded over to my group and initiated some solid kino by playfully hip bumping me into one of my girl friends. My friends gave me the 'wtf is this guy' look and I reassured them that I knew him and that we'd gotten familiar earlier. This guy now has **massive social proof** both within my group, and outside it (as other girls see him being accepted into an all female 4 set). He then grabs my hand and says 'come to the bar with me'. This was a decent attempt at isolation but I was having fun dancing with my friends so I declined. This is where the guy's game could have been better: he immediately ejected from the interaction with me, started dirty dancing all up in my best friend's grill, and went in for the insta-makeout. He was clearly practicing some serious abundance mentality: 'she doesn't want me, DGAF, NEXT'. The problem was, I did want him, I was just having fun and didn't want to bounce right that second. Had he danced with the group a little more, waited for a slightly lamer song to come on, and tried the bar move again, I would have gone with him without hesitation. As it was, my friend shut him down because she knew he'd kissed me already, and I was no longer interested because I found his behaviour offputting.




**Approach 2**



So my friend and I were standing just off the dancefloor when we were approached by HG5. He was clearly targeting my girl (I choose to reassure myself that this is because he was short and I am 6', but I may have to resign myself to the fact that it is because my friend is Hot). As he started by talking to her, I'm not sure how he opened, but I know that once he was in set he ran some pretty good game. Despite clearly being interested in my friend (let's call her A), he made sure to **interact with the two of us fairly equally**, which helped me feel comfortable and prevented a 'standing there awkwardly while he hit on her' situation. This worked in his favour too, because girls are often very sensitive to the feelings of the group, and had A sensed my discomfort she would have been unlikely to engage with him for long. I don't remember a lot of the conversation, but here are some things he did well:


1. This guy was **peacocking like a motherfucker**, but not in a way that made him laughable. We're talking bracelets, necklaces, interesting print shirt, nose ring, and geek glasses.


2. When asked, he assured us that the glasses were prescription. If you're going to wear them purely for fashion, please don't let on, because a lot of girls will think you're a knob.


3. At one point, A asked him about his necklaces, and as he was replying he noticed that I was distracted. He threw in a playful comment something along the lines of 'hang on a second, we seem to have lost someone. Is she always like this?' which simultaneously **banded him and A together** ('we' VS 'she') and called me out on my rude behaviour.


4. So my friend A is a bit of a pictures freak and so obviously insisted she get a photo in HG5's glasses. 


* First off, HG5 immediately **insisted on an 'us together' shot** (taken by me) as opposed to the shot of just her that she was planning on making him take.
* Second, he let her get the pose she wanted. If a girl suggests a picture, she wants to look hot in it. Only after that has been achieved can you start suggesting she bust out some ridiculous moves. The one this guy went for was an 'angry shot', which I thought was a pretty good one because it's fun, but the girls who are particularly conscious of how they look can still pull a sexy pouty face and call it anger. Something HG5 didn't do here but could have was give the anger a justification (e.g. an 'our first fight' roleplay).
* By this point HG5 had probably built enough comfort to go for the 'sexual tension shot' (a smouldering look into each other's eyes which can build actual sexual tension if done right) or at least a kiss on the cheek picture.


At this point I decided to eject to give the two a little privacy. I later found out that A would have happily gone for the number/k-close by the end of the interaction, but that the guy had said he was going to find his friends to introduce to her, but never came back. No idea what happened there. Perhaps A unleashed some level 7 crazy after I left.




**Approach 3**




Ridiculously high energy group of guys on the dancefloor, of varying degrees of attractiveness. These guys were the epitome of **self-amusement**. Jumping up and down, punching the air, some truly fabulous dance moves. In terms of the actual approach, one guy grabbed an empty bottle from a table and started an impromptu spin the bottle with the surrounding sets (including us). When the bottle landed on me, the initiator took one look at my embarrassed (but not entirely unreceptive) expression, and planted a massively sloppy kiss on and around my mouth which was clearly intended to disgust. The fact that he **went against every expectation I had** and didn't actually use this excuse to go in for the makeout made me a lot more attracted to him. Of course, it may have been the case that these guys genuinely were just out for a good time and I'm reading way too much into it. But, intentional or not, this behaviour created attraction (and I would have pursued this had I not been dragged forcefully to the smoking area by my friends shortly afterwards).


..so this turned out to be a lot longer than I was expecting. But anyway. I hope you guys find the girl’s perspective at least interesting, and if it turns out to be helpful too then I’d be happy to continue posting other approaches. You guys are fab,

And he fucking KILLS it with women. A complete and total natural.

There's a dominant idea in this community that naturals are oblivious to what they're doing – that they just go around and pick up girls by their nature alone. Although this is true for some, I've noticed that at the highest levels of seduction, even the naturals need to know exactly what they're doing to really be in control of their lives.

For example, some guys can naturally pick up girls, but they're a mess in every other aspect of their lives. They've slept with over 100 girls but can't maintain a relationship, have no financial skills, and no reliable emotional control.

Who wants this? Not me. 

My Israeli friend is the only natural I've ever met who’s never studied any seduction material, yet can attract women effortlessly AND kills it in every other aspect of life. But more-so, he's aware WHY he's successful with women, and can explain it – something very few ""naturals"" are capable of.

I've learned a HUGE amount just from hanging out with him, and I figured since he's around, he could provide some outside of the box ideas... hopefully stuff no one's seen around here.

So without further ado...

**Idea #1: Posture, and REAL ""Peacocking""**

We all have an idea of what ""peacocking"" is from Mystery... weird hats, rings, goggles... basically looking like a clown.

Funnily enough, this idea completely misses the point. The Peacock does not need external accessories to attract a mate. Instead, everything it needs is built into the peacock, naturally.

Humans are no exception to this rule. We have all the tools for attraction and ""peacocking"" built into us, by default. But it doesn't come in the form of rings, watches, or external objects.

So where does it come from? **Posture.** Your posture is a direct 1:1 manifestation of how you feel internally. If you're depressed and shy, you have closed down posture. If you're feeling extremely confident, you'll be relaxed, you’ll have little-to-no muscle tension, and TALL posture.

When you are in this confident state and are receptive to finding a good looking girl, you are naturally ""peacocking"". You become an antenna for women who are also looking for a mate of their own! The funny thing is, every man is *naturally* a chick magnet... but most of us have never learned how to flip the switch!

By walking with tall posture (literally, standing as tall as you possibly can), you realize something very important: **women often make the first move!**

But they don't do it through touching you or talking to you. No, they do it through eye contact, smiling at you, shyly looking down when you hold eye contact, etc. If you have fantastic posture and stand with absolute confidence in yourself, you become a magnet for these ""first moves"". Therefore, the game changes from ""I'm going to try and seduce a girl"" to finding the girls who are already “making moves” on you, and talking to them.

Realize that when you first stand up tall, you’ll feel a bit goofy... you’ll feel really self-conscious. You think, ""I look weird standing up tall like this."" Realize EVERYONE feels this way, which is why very few people truly stand with fantastic posture. It's not easy!

But now that you're aware of this, be strong enough to hold your head high no matter what, and you will literally become a magnet for girls who are looking for a confident man.

Think about it... regardless of how you look, if you're the only person out of 100 who is standing up as tall as he can, what does that say about you?

After learning this from my friend, I put it into action. I immediately noticed girls trying to get *my* attention, when I've spent so many years trying to get theirs! Try it out… after seeing it in action, you will NEVER walk around with slouched posture again.

Even though I'm much smaller than my Israeli friend, the fact that I have the confidence to stand as tall as I can at all times proves I have deep, unshakable internal confidence.

**Idea #2: Minimal Texting**

If you've ever lost a girl due to poor texting, pay close attention to this part. Personally, texting was ALWAYS my achilles heel... I’ve “lost” countless girls due to shitty texting.

But after grasping this idea, that’s all changed – I now view texting as ""solved"".

When we first get a girl's number, we wonder when we should text her. And what that text should say. Then we spend all of our time trying to get her to respond to us.

You know how it feels... you send a text and you feel like shit: ""was that the right thing to say?"" Then we beat ourselves up, because right after we send the text, we realize we could've sent one that was 100x better... but it's too late!

This is fucking madness and it’s all unnecessary. In fact, it's not the texts themselves that get you the girl, **so trying to be witty is what's losing you the girl in the first place!**

If a girl is into you, she wants to meetup. Therefore, texting every second of the day is going to do nothing but show your neediness, and increase the odds that you say something that turns her off.

If a girl isn't into you, no amount of witty comments will change that.

I remember I was working next to my Israeli friend, and I asked him if he'd texted a girl he met at the bar the previous night. He said, ""no, I don't text girls when I'm working – only when I can meet up with them.""

That's right. He only texts a girl if he has the ability to meet up with them. This makes texting incredibly simple. Is your night free? Send her a text.

Now, this doesn't mean you just text her saying ""come over"". You still use stuff like call-back humor for the first text. But after a text or two, you invite her out, or over to your place, or whatever it is you choose.

If she says yes, you're in. If she says no, pay attention to how she says it:

• If she says NO with an excuse (""I'm busy, headache, homework"") and DOESN'T give you an option for another meetup (""I'm busy, what about tomorrow evening?""), she's most likely not interested in you. Either text her in a week's time and try again or delete her number.


• If she texts NO but suggests another time to meetup, meetup then and seal the deal!

This will save you TONS of time... both in exchanging messages back and forth, and texting girls who aren't interested in you to begin with.
In my early days, I would literally text girls for months (or in the worst case, YEARS), never making anything happen with them! This way, you make things happen very quickly, or they were never going to happen in the first place.

View texting as a logistical tool – nothing more!

**Idea #3: Want a Girl Who's Working? Ask for the Number IMMEDIATELY**

We all have fantasies of picking up that cute waitress, or the girl who works at the bank. And we've always heard that this is one of the most difficult situations.

It's true – girls are in ""work mode"", and if they flirt with you, it's most likely because they have to because of their job.

But there is a way to break this ""work mode""... you come out right upfront and say what you're interested in. Picture this, you see a good looking girl at a bank, you walk up to her, she says ""Hello, how are you"", you say ""What's your number?""

She's shocked, her world is turned upside down. She will most likely not give you the number immediately... however, you've now changed the entire frame of the interaction. It's no longer ""work mode"". You've broken through that, and can now proceed with the intent to get her number before you end the interaction with her.

Obviously this doesn't guarantee you a number of a girl working. It's still not easy. However, this gives you a MUCH better chance of getting her number, and also fulfills her ""prince charming"" desires... the wish every girl has for a one-in-a-million dude to come up to her and destroy her reality.

I've always wanted to be able to pick up girls who are working. But I always did it wrong. I would go to a place a hot chick worked, flirt with her, then leave, planning on ""getting her number later"". Months would go by, I'd finally ask her, and be horribly rejected.

However, with this mindset, I've never failed to get a working girl's number.

Now, this mindset is really dependent on your inner state. Are you truly a confident and high-value man? If you are, you will emit the vibe of ""Here's your chance to have me"". And that's all it will be – a chance for her to meet up with you later.

You have to be professional. If it clearly isn't going to work, simply go along with what you were doing. If you were at a bank, ask for her number, if it's not working (and you'll be able to feel it), simply go about your business at the bank, and say ""have a nice day"" without thinking about it.

This is definitely not easy to do, but it is a REAL method that can truly help you meet up with women you met while they were working.
If the thought of instantly asking for a number bothers you, try making it the *third* thing you say: 1) intro 2) direct compliment 3) ask for the number.

**Closing Thoughts**

These three ideas have totally changed my life. When talking to my friend, I asked him if he'd be willing to answer questions. Thanks to his advice, I've gone from a dude who could only flirt with girls, to a dude who can get numbers, meet up with girls, and seal the deal consistently.

He doesn't have much time, but if you have a question and you’d like a solid answer, if you donate $1 to a charity he’s working with, he’ll answer your question. It's for education, and from what I know, it's an outside of the box way to get money straight to teachers who give a damn.

If you have a sticking point that's been holding you back, and you have no clue how you can get past it, or you feel it's impossible to get past it, he can definitely help you out – he's done it with me countless times.

Hey guys. I want to thank you all for your feedback &amp; support over the past years. This is a very personal post, so I hope you take the time to read it.

About a year ago I had a vision. I was fed up with the state of seduction material. The pickup business has morphed into an endless stream of fluffy blog posts, newsletters, Youtube videos, and podcasts. It was no longer about the content. It was about inundating you with messages to get you to sign up for $3000 bootcamps.

I hated the fact that we didn't have a modern, concise guide to share with our members on our sidebar. So I did what I had to do. I created one.

---

**""ABOVE THE GAME"" KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN**

The [*Above The Game*](http://redd.it/11ng7n) guide you see in the sidebar is just the tip of the iceberg. Reddit is great for a lot of things, but it's not even close to ideal for long-form content. I have an entire book worth of content in my notes but I want to give it a proper treatment. Plus you guys keep messaging me asking me to write a book!

**So today I am pre-announcing a Kickstarter campaign to publish a full-length *Above The Game* book.** It will be both a physical and e-book. I will make certain that the various funding tiers will offer substantial value to all backers. I hope to go live in the next 1-2 weeks. I will be raising $2000.

This will be the first book *by seddit - for seddit.*

---

**HOW TO STAY UPDATED ON THIS PROJECT**

reddit is not the ideal medium for project updates. I also don't want to spam seddit. To alleviate this problem, I've set up an email mailing list for you to receive updates.

I'm going to take the Louis CK approach and only update you when I have something really important to say.

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:**

**1) Why Kickstarter? Why not just start a seduction company?**

I'm using Kickstarter because it's the easiest way to run this project with the community in mind. I have no desire to become a full-time pickup instructor. I believe the bootcamp business model is flawed. If I took that route, I would have to compromise the quality of instruction in order to stay afloat. I can't bring myself to do that. This allows me to focus solely on the best teachings and keep my day job.

**2) Why are you stepping down as moderator?**

Seddit is the largest unaffiliated seduction forum on the internet. We are very proud of the fact that we are not affiliated with any companies. We prefer to remain unbiased and pure. Even though I'm just publishing a book and not starting a full-fledged business, it would be a conflict of interest for me to remain as moderator for the duration of the campaign and promotion cycle. I may return as a moderator at a later date, but I will be stepping down the moment the kickstarter goes live.

**3) Does the book contain new material?**

The book will be full of new, unpublished material. I have been drafting up notes for over a year now and the book is the culmination of all my efforts. I believe this will be the best seduction book ever published.

**4) Fuck you. I'm not giving you a dime.**

That's not a question, but I'll allow it. :)

None of this would be possible without the amazing seddit community. As such, I am proud to announce that I will be giving away all the content in the *Above The Game* book for free right here on seddit in the months that follow the kickstarter campaign. So no worries!

**5) Why should we back the campaign then?**

Back the campaign for any of the following reasons:

* You want the best-organized and highest quality version of the material.
* You want access to all the *Above The Game* material before anyone else.
* You want a hard copy.
* You want to read it on your device of choice (Ipad, Kindle, Android).
* You want to support a homegrown seddit project.
* You want to help legitimize seddit with a proper published book.
* You want to give a copy to a friend.
* You want your name/username listed in the book (this will be one of many gifts).
* You want to say thank you for my posts over the years.
* You want to encourage me to publish again in the future.

**6) Shut up and take my money.**

OK.

**ABOUT ME**

Just like you, I read the books. I watched the videos. I read and commented on thousands of seddit posts. I subscribed to blogs and newsletters. But most importantly, I went OUT a lot. I tested theories. I experimented. I came up with new things. I posted dozens of field reports detailing my interactions. I shared and learned from your feedback.

Together with the other moderators, I helped bring in professional seduction gurus for our [Seddit AMA Interview Series](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/qd0gf/list_of_iama_mpua_interview_series/) to learn from. I organized our lair system and spent a great deal of time in-field with great guys from all over the world (Shout out to /r/BayAreaSeddit, /r/GothamSeddit, and /r/TokyoSeddit!) I hung out with hundreds of you guys. I coached countless men. Some of my best friends in the world came from the seddit community.

In other words, I did my 10,000 hours.

I reached a level of clarity where I felt comfortable writing the guide you all deserve. I spent over a year scribbling out all my notes, slowly forming the framework that turned into [*Above The Game*](http://redd.it/11ng7n).

However, in recent months, I figured out a little trick that has worked 100% of the time.

Basically, I call a girl, and If a day and a half goes by and I haven't heard back, I will text her saying ""If I was giving out grades on your call back skills, you would definitely get an F!""

I kid you not, 100% of the time, the girls have responded. Even if she isn't interested or whatever, the girl will text back with something. If she texts back with some excuse, I will then respond by saying ""Terrible excuse, but at least you are trying. For that, I will raise your grade to an F+"" This then usually gets into stuff about extra credit and how she can raise her grade.

EDIT: To help squash any doubts, here are some exact quotes from the last few time I have done this:

Me- Hey! If I was giving grades on your call back skills, you would definitely get an F!

Her- Haha that is fair. Hopefully that isn't the final grade!

Me- Well, your final grade depends on you. But I could probably think of some extra credit for ya, and raise your grade to an F+ hahaha

Her- Hmmm not even a full letter grade... What did you have in mind for this extra credit?

ANOTHER EXAMPLE

Me- If I had to give you a grade for your calling back abilities... I'm afraid I would give you an F!

Her- Haha i'm sorry my life is crazy! I was totally gonna text you today but you beat me to it!

Me- Haha yes of course. Typical excuse. It's ok, just embrace your inner slacker! Regardless, I will raise your grade to an F+

Her- Haha can I get any extra credit??

HERE IS ONE THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT

Me- If I was giving grades on your call back skills, you would definitely get an F!

Her- I just ended a 3 year relationship last month. It was/still is rough. Sorry dude... just need me time.

Me- If I was giving grades on your call back skills, you would definitely get an F!

Her- Haha sorry!!!! Things have been pretty crazy... I had 3 online exams and a glogster project due yesterday. I slept until 2pm today because of my lack of sleep all weekend.

Me- A glogster project? Tiffany, making up words won't save you. Though, for your creativity, I will raise your grade to an F+

Anyway, I highly recommend that you gentlemen try it out sometime. How well it works really blows my mind.

EDIT 2- I also just tried another variant with great success. I said ""Bad news X, report cards are coming out, and I'm afraid you are getting a frowny face for your calling-back skills"".

Her- Oh shit! I forgot! Hahaha! You would make a school joke [I work at a college]. I'm going out of town tomorrow and between work and pre-trip errands, I'm a total mess!

Me- Jess, Jess, Jess. Your excuses are bad and you should feel bad lol! But heck, let's say we raise your grad to a frowny face plus.

Her- Can I earn some extra credit!? Haha

Me- Yeah... probably. But if you slack on it, ooooh man, you will be in so much trouble!!

Her- I do kind of like to be in trouble though...

ANOTHER EXAMPLE

Her- Lol!! I'm sorry!! Work was crazy busy the last couple of days and I have been exhausted. I was definitely slacking a bit ;P

Me- Pshhh typical excuse lol! But for your efforts I will see if I can get your grade to a frowny face plus.

Her- Haha ok good... At least that's a start :)

Me- True true. There is basically nowhere to go but up. If you're free sometime later next week, let's go out and see if we can't raise that grade a bit.

Her- Ok sounds good to me :)",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1345001785.0,,,True,t3_t5qc5,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/t5qc5/texting_trick_that_has_never_failed_me/,

I like to see what you fellows are up to, and recently had a really enjoyable interaction and thought it might be of some use from a female perspective. I was out with a few friends for cinco de mayo, generally celebrating and enjoying ourselves. My girlfriend and I started talking with another girl at the bar, and her friend (male) walks up started talking with us. My girlfriend and his friend were kind of deep in conversation, so he started chatting with just me, and we had a really enjoyable conversation. He was relaxed, making jokes, clearly comfortable in his own skin and able to laugh at himself and at me. He also made my other friend (male) feel more comfortable by making a clear effort to include him in the conversation. After 15 or 20 minutes he said he should go hang out with his friends some more (he was also there with a group) which was good. He wasn't seeming over-eager, but was definitely interested (lightly touched my knee a few times, etc.). So as my friends and I were leaving he called me over and said ""Hey [philo], I'm committed to hanging out with my friends tonight, but I would really like to hang out with you again. Can I get your number?""

This was super classy, and awesome, and is also one of the surest ways to get a number. First of all, he wasn't about to ditch his friends to hang out with some girl he just met. Second of all, he made it clear that he wasn't rejecting me by not only asking for my number, but stating that he definitely wanted to see me again. Thirdly, it was very direct. He was clear about getting my number, clear about showing intent, and wasn't creepy about it b/c we'd had a really fun conversation earlier in the evening. 

I don't know if this is helpful, but as a woman, it was a refreshing approach and I thought with all the male reports on here, maybe hearing from a woman what it's like would be useful.

1358004582.0,603,self.seduction,16fta7,I've been reading seddit for 1+ yr. I'm a girl. Some Insights,1199,596,296,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16fta7/ive_been_reading_seddit_for_1_yr_im_a_girl_some/,"22F here. As I wrote, I've been reading seddit for a year. I've read the good, the bad and the ugly here. Here's what I've learned/realized/want to get off of my chest. My 'advice' if you could call it that is primarily for those of you who characterize yourself as inexperienced. If you're getting laid doing what you're doing, keep on going dude and good for you. 

-- The overreaching message of this community is great. Go out, have a good time, be outcome-independent, be interesting, become the best version of yourself, give no fucks. The top posts, the ones of with the most upvotes, they get that right. It's not so much their techniques as the way they frame their life. I'd go out on a limb and say their/that attitude is more beneficial to them in attracting women than their actual techniques

-- There are a ton of different styles (obviously) and they're not all going to work for you. Peacocking, for example (and to be fair it's not like peacocking comes up often at all in this seddit) can work really well for some guys and not at all for others. 'Gaming' is not a one size fits all solution, you can read as much as you want on it but what works for Mystery might not work for you. It depends on a ton of factors, your best bet is to try different styles and see what feels natural and gets you the most success. 

-- STOP READING SEDDIT IF YOU'RE A HIGHSCHOOLER. Again, understand overarching theme of seddit (give no fucks, etc) ? Great. You're done here. There's a reason most FRs involve bars or clubs or parties. Focus your time on school or your friends or your hobbies. High school might be the only place you will be able to make true platonic female friends. Make some just for the sake of having friends that are girls or being in a friend group with girls. If you leave high school with the feeling of being comfortable carrying a conversation with a girl 1 on 1, you're fine. You'll have plenty of time for sarging/gaming in college and later on.

-- When you're reading a FR that involves a lot of success (an F close, say) realize that these guys have had numerous nights where shit hasn't worked. They've fined-tuned their game. 'Techniques' like kinoing, for example, can go VERY WRONG if you don't know what you're doing (in the example of kinoing, it can come off as creepy, and once a girl thinks you're creepy it's hard coming back.) I'm not saying not to do it, I'm saying that understand that if you're a total n00b there will (probably) be failure involved. Work up to it.

-- That being said, a huge pet peeve of mine are those challenges where guys go up to random women and ask WHAT TIME IT  IS. I get you have AA, but we all have cell phones so that will come off as weird. If your AA is to the point that asking someone for the time causes anxiety (and there's nothing wrong with that, you gotta start somewhere!) ask instead if they know where [important public transit stop, landmark in your town that everyone knows] is. 

-- Don't feel like sarging/gaming? I'm not saying you need to game every night, but if you feel the need to but talk yourself out of it for any reason, then spend an hour that day/night exercising. It's not gaming but it's self-improvement and you'll feel better about yourself. You don't have to be the best looking to get girls, but the more attractive you are, the easier it gets. 

-- Ever heard of the book (yep, it was a book first!) called ""He's Just Not That Into You""? It's written for women and it's basically like 'if he doesn't make an effort, he's not into you.' Guess what? It's the same for girls. If she flakes, seems unresponsive, SHE'S NOT INTO YOU. This is especially true because (next point)...

-- Girls lead guys on all of the time. For fun, for self-validation, for whatever reason. Don't waste your time on them. Make it clear you don't want to be their FRIEND and if they don't reciprocate that then move on. 

-- If there's one thing that I can't preach enough, if you want to eventually fuck the girl you're gaming, you need to make it clear that you're not looking to be friends. You don't escalate kino like a madman if that doesn't work for you nor do you need to bring up sex all of the time for this. For example, if there's a cute girl in your class, don't just get her number and ask her to study or for coffee multiple times. Hang out with her 1 on 1 and then invite her to a party or a bar or whatever. Guys wait too long to be proactive and end up friendzoning themselves. 

-- This might contradict what I just said, but I've read a lot about making conversations sexual and asking women about the craziest shit they've done, etc. This works ONLY IF THE WOMAN IS OPEN TO THE IDEA OF HAVING SEX WITH YOU ALREADY. There's no real good tell for that, but realize that asking a girl you barely know about her sexual life can cross boundaries. Yes, make it clear you're not looking to be friends but that doesn't mean you need ask the craziest place she's had sex. 

-- If a girl tells you she has a boyfriend, it's because a) it's true and she doesn't want to waste your time or b) she's  trying to politely tell you she's not interested at that moment. Yeah maybe you can change her mind and you'll have mind-blowing amazing sex that night. But if you're a novice and a girl tells you that, focus your energy elsewhere. 

-- The term oneitis is misleading. It's normal to like one person, regardless of their gender, more than another. It's normal for you to like one girl more than the next. What you're doing wrong is eschewing everything you've learned with seddit and revert back to your old, unsuccessful behavior with her. That's why it's not working out. Pursue her but don't drop everything else for her. 

-- Negging. For the love of God, don't do it. I know, I know seddit preaches to only do it to the hottest of the hot, but what you fail to account for is a girls self esteem. The hottest girls aren't necessarily the most confident. Even if the girl has THE BEST LEGS YOU'VE EVER SEEN, don't make a neg about them because you have no idea how she feels about them. You really need a special frame, girl, situation and personality to pull it off. Unless you're getting laid left and right, don't neg a girl. Being cocky (can be) good, being a total asshole is not. Which is how most negs come across IRL. But if you're going to do it, make sure the girl is a legit 9 or 10, or that feature that you're negging is a 9 or 10 feature.  (edit: I seriously debated putting this one in because it's such a firestorm. i'm not saying negging doesn't work, I'm just saying use it on girls that are EXTREMELY confident.)

AAAAAnd with that, I'm unsubscribing from seddit and askseddit (on my non-throwaway, duh). It felt really good to get this off my chest. Good luck to you guys! 

EDIT: I guess I'm surprised that some of yall seem upset that this is just a rehash of the sidebar? Of course it is. It's, from one year, things I've noted in my head over and over. I'm glad though that there are mini debates going on in the comments about certain points, that's awesome.

1350585943.0,601,self.seduction,11pbca,I’d Rather Die on My Feet Than Live on My Knees,788,187,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11pbca/id_rather_die_on_my_feet_than_live_on_my_knees/,"A guy I know caught his girlfriend cheating on him. But instead of leaving her, he stuck around for months playing tug of war over the girl with the other guy. Who would put up with a girl openly cheating on him? Who would put up with a girl treating him like shit?

When a guy is in a terrible relationship with a girl, it’s easy to see that the best option for him is to walk away. No one should stay in a crappy relationship where the woman nags him, bosses him around, or treats him disrespectfully.

The problem is that these things don’t usually happen out of the blue. It’s not like she was treating him amazingly well one day, and the next just started treating him like crap. These things happen on smaller increments. And they happen… right from the start.

**Right from the beginning, he accepted less than he should have from this woman.** 

Perhaps he texted her and she didn’t return his text. So he texted her again. Begrudgingly, she agreed to meet him for a date. And the relationship progressed from there.

His first mistake was to keep pursuing when she wasn’t giving him enough back. When you do that, you willingly enter into a field already sown with the seeds of disrespect.

As you get better with women, you become more sensitive to when a woman is not “giving you enough.” She’s not showing enough interest. She’s not initiating enough with you. She’s not making enough of an effort. 

Guys inexperienced with women tend to put MORE effort in when a girl isn’t giving him enough. This makes things even worse.

I recently had a girl cancel a date on me 30 minutes before the date.

“So sorry I can’t make it!” she texted me. “Let’s schedule something for next week if you’re still up for it.”

Most guys, when losing an opportunity like this, will give her more. They’ll start to be *nicer* to the girl in the hopes that his dwindling opportunity is restored.

“Sure! No problem,” he’ll say. “Just let me know what day works for you.”

What he should be doing is upping the ante. Even if he did get a date with the girl in this situation, he would have no power on the date. She would have no respect for him.

Instead, he should be making the hurdle HIGHER for her if she’s showing less interest. 

Instead of texting her back right away, I waited until the next day. In the afternoon, I texted her, “It depends, are you going to wear a skirt or jeans?”

Raising the hurdle higher like this does two important things for you.

First, If she really isn’t interested enough, it pushes her away. It slams the door shut on an opportunity that would have put you in a bad position anyway.

Second, if she does leap over that hurdle, it builds attraction and raises your perceived value.

Of all the tips, tricks and formulas for being confident or “alpha” with women, the most important is this:

**Be willing to walk away if you aren’t getting enough respect or interest.**

Respect for yourself starts here, right at the beginning when you meet her… when you first text with her… when you invite her out on that first date. Practice letting women walk out that door if you're not getting enough interest. Yes, you may have to learn how to get women *in the door* if you can’t already do that. But remember, women respect men who respect themselves.

You can’t ASK HER to respect you. You can only show her how much you respect yourself by not letting her get away with anything that disrespects you. Often times, that means watching an opportunity die. And that may be the best thing. As the saying goes, it is better to die on your feet than live on your knees.

1362122614.0,602,self.seduction,19g9so,Field Report: Challenge given by a Redditor to open with a ridiculous line. Challenge accepted.,731,129,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/19g9so/field_report_challenge_given_by_a_redditor_to/,"After a challenge given by someone in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/199xnz/opener_let_me_know_when_youre_having_too_much_fun/) thread to pick up a woman by opening with the phrase ""Butt cheese"", I decided to give it a go just for yucks. The following is a fairly approximate narration of the events that transpired and the conversation I ended up having.

While visiting my parents in the Chicago suburbs, I decided to grab a drink at one of the local shitty sports bars before I headed back home. This place wasn't much to look at; just a bar in the center of the room and a bunch of high-def televisions playing the hockey game or whatever. It was a Thursday, so there weren't many people in the bar, save for a handful of guys who'd gotten off of work, some older women who were chitchatting about something, and a girl in a knitted scarf drinking a Blue Moon and sucking on the orange slice.

I figure, fuck it; I've got nothing to lose. I hardly ever make it out to the suburbs and judging by the way this girl's dressed, she looks like she's got a sense of humor. So I start walking over to her, doing a little white guy dance as I'm walking, making my approach fairly comical. She catches it and begins to smirk, then grin, obviously wondering why I'm walking up to her doing a duck face and some kind of butchered version of the electric slide. When I finally get up to her, I lean in and whisper, ""Butt cheese."" in a completely monotone, almost Buffalo Bill style of voice.

She bursts out laughing. ""What the fuck?!"" She asks, her confusion and amusement in equal measure.

""Yeah, I got nothing. I just wanted to see if that'd work. Shots?""

""What?""

""Shots. What kind you want?""

""Uh... I dunno. What are you drinking?""

I lean in and yell at the bartender, ""Two Rumchata shots.""

""What is that?"" She asks.

""You're a girl, you'll like it.""

She laughs. The bartender pours the drinks, the girl and I encircle arms and down them. She's following my lead at this point because she has no idea what to do in this situation. I slam the shot glass down. She obviously likes the drink, as she's bobbing her head in approval at it.

""Right?"" I say.

""Rumchata?"" She asks.

""Yeah. It's like a horchata but with booze.""

""I've never had one of those before.""

I give an exaggerated look of disapproval. She laughs and asks, ""What?""

""Sheltered much?""

""Oh my god!"" She punches me in the arm playfully. ""So what do you do?""

""Shit, is it too late to make something up?""

She laughs again. ""No, by all means.""

I pretend to think for a second. ""Uh... Pirate astronaut.""

""Wow!"" She laughs and gives me an exaggerated look of fascination. ""That sounds really exciting.""

""So what are you, a model or some bullshit?""

She laughs and bats her eyes and touching her hair in a modeling pose before playfully batting at my wrist. ""I work at Kohls.""

""That was my second guess.""

She gives me a fake look of shock and says, ""Ass!""

At this point, I look at her drink and see it's halfway down. ""You been nursing that long?""

""I drink slow.""

""Chicks, man.""

She laughs. I order her another drink on my tab and pull out my phone. ""How do you spell your name?""

She looks at my phone, pauses for a moment, then says, ""K-A-Y-L-A. Did you even tell me your name?""

""Nope. 815?""

She laughs and proceeds to fill in her number. Then I smirk and reply, ""Jack.""

""A pleasure to meet you.""

""Ditto."" I keep looking at my phone the whole time, texting her the message ""Butt cheese."" as we speak. She looks at her phone a moment later and sees the text, then bursts out laughing again.

""What does that even mean?""

""I assume either a wedge of cheese in your ass, or some sort of disgusting waxy substance you get after not showering for a few days.""

""Blegh!"" She makes a gagging expression. ""What the hell?""

""I dunno. Some guy told me I should say it to the next hot girl I see.""

She laughs and starts to blush. ""You're terrible.""

""Yeah, I know. And now I'm gonna leave you to think about that one.""

""Wait, you're leaving?""

""Yep. Got shit to do and places to be. I'll shoot you a text some time. Later, nucka!""

And then I pay my tab and leave.

by BENJAMINWESTFIELD on 19. JUL, 2010 in TALKING TO WOMEN

You walk up to a woman and say “Hey”. She smiles and says “Hi”. And then what do you do? Well you need to keep a conversation going! Because if you are not talking to her in a smooth and controlled manner, you’re probably not going to be able to get her number let alone take her home with you. Keeping a conversation alive with a woman can be difficult. My mind just used to go blank and I was never sure of what I should talk about. But after years of working on this and observing some of the best seducers talking to women, I finally understand how you can use conversation as a tool to attract women.

In this post I will show you a conversation technique which will help you keep a conversation going for as long as you want. If you can master this simple technique, you can have the confidence to approach anyone, not just beautiful women, and start talking. I will also show you how you should approach conversation with women, because after all, a woman’s thought processes are completely different from a man’s.



So what exactly is a ‘conversation’ and what does it mean for men and women?
A conversation is a way for people to exchange ideas and thoughts with each other. Everyone involved gets to put their input and learn more about the other. Conversation also comes in a variety of forms. We can exchange information on our feelings, emotions, experiences, problems…and just about anything else. So what is the goal of conversation?

When men talk together, the predominant goal is to find out information. We exchange tips or we try and help others with their problems. So we use conversation to collect and give away conversation. There is a clear purpose to our exchanges. Women, however, use conversation to bond. That’s why you’ll see women on the phone with each other for literally hours. They’ll keep swapping stories and talking about what seems to us as pointless things. Therefore, for women, conversation itself is the goal.

An example might make this distinction clearer:

If Grant just breaks up with his girlfriend and tells his friends, they would tell him that he needs to find a new girl or that he should just take some time off and enjoy being single. They would basically give him some emotional support and then help him fix the problem. Alex may tell him that there ‘plenty of fish in the sea’ and Brad may offer to be his wingman until he finds a new girlfriend.

On the flipside, Jenny who broke up would also tell her friends. And instead of trying to solve the problem, they will tell stories of their past break ups. Jess may talk about how she got cheated on once and Kirsty may talk about her loser ex-boyfriend. Her friends will give her emotional support…and carry one giving emotional support.

You have to understand that women constantly relate with each other and share similar stories. That’s just how they communicate. That’s why you often hear a woman saying “I like him a lot, he gets me so well” or “He just seems to know where I’m coming from!” She would never say something like “I love him; he just seems to fix all my problems”.

For women the goal of conversation is conversation itself

But what happens when an average man walks up to an average woman and starts talking? Well he shares his story first and she shares her story, and then he comments on her story. He may tell her how it could be better or what he liked about it.

For example:

Woman: “We spent a whole week at the Caribbean beaches. It was great but we all got sunburnt!”

Man: “Wow that’s pretty bad, you gotta wear some sunblock, the sun can be pretty strong”

What the man said here may have been OK if he was talking to another guy, but with a woman it’s a no-no! What she really wanted him to say was something like this:

Man: “Tell me about, I went out for an hour at my local beach the other day and returned home bright red”

Now, you may not notice the difference between the two inputs, but for women the second one is far more interesting and something they can relate to. Making this slight shift in your conversation will massively increase your attraction to women. After all there aren’t that many men that women can feel they can really connect to. But how do you make this shift and how do keep the conversation going? Well, let me tell you that it is much easier than you could have imagined.


I was bored of searching for stock images of couples having conversations, so I got an image of Elisha Cuthbert instead. Yep, she's fine.
Threading-the simplest and most effective conversation technique
I am sure that you have seen someone knit before? Knitting involves taking a thread of yarn and weaving it into another thread. And you keep doing this back and forth until one or two threads turns into a hat or a muffler. By using a simple technique you can create something bigger and more beautiful than the original threads. The same goes for conversation.

When you’re talking to a woman, you’re simply exchanging sentences. You say something, she says something back. It goes on and on. And at the end of the night, hopefully she will look back on your conversation as a powerful and attractive thing you shared with her. Conversation, like knitting, consists of easy and simple components woven together to create something more amazing.

When you think of a conversation like this, keeping a conversation alive is easy, you’re mind will never go blank and you will always have something interesting to say. All that you need to learn is a skill called ‘Conversation Threading’. It involves taking a piece of her sentence and using it to make a sentence of your own. Let me use an example to explain:

Woman: “I love going to the Paris. It’s so romantic”

You: “Paris is my favourite city. I love the laid-back nature of the people”

Or

You: “Yeah as soon as you arrive in the city you can feel the romantic energy”

Or

You: “What is it about Paris that you especially love?”

Or

You: “What do you think makes Paris so romantic?”

I came up with these sentences in literally a few seconds. How? It’s quite easy- let’s look at the woman’s sentence one more time.

Woman: “I love going to the Paris. It’s so romantic”

In this sentence, there are at least three ‘threads’. These are parts of sentences you can talk about. In this case the threads were:

1. I love…

2. Paris

3. so romantic

So you can talk about:

1. Things you love

2. Paris

3. How you find Paris/other places romantic

You can do this everytime she speaks, and you will find that the conversation will have a natural flow and you will never run out of things to say. Just pick a thread, relate and then wait for her to reply. Pick a thread, relate and then wait for her to reply. And so on. If you can master this skill it will increase your confidence when it comes to approaching women, because you know how to start and fuel a conversation. If you come across a woman in a shopping mall and she says “I’m just shopping around for some jeans with my friends”, you know that you can thread off to talk about:

1. Shopping (“There’s this store on the second floor you’ll love…”)

2. Jeans (“I hope you’re not one of those who goes for ripped jeans”)

3. Her friends (“Your friends seem like a great group of girls. How do you know each other?”)

Can you see how easy it can become with some practice? You can take any of the above responses and use them to keep the conversation going.

And remember this technique only helps you to find WHAT to talk to her about; it helps you direct the conversation where you want to go. You also need to watch HOW you talk to her. While you’re having an intriguing and long conversation, you can add in a bit of tension and teasing and most importantly touching. Touch her on the shoulder when you want to emphasize a point. If you combine a great conversation with the right tension and physical escalation it will become a breeze to isolate her and take things to the next level.

Ultimately
…women are looking for intriguing and exciting men over big, good-looking hunks. It’s always been like that. That’s why it’s important for you to make sure you can have captivating conversations with anyone, not just women. From now on, keep practicing the threading technique. It doesn’t matter who you do it with first, just get good at it. If you can master the art of threading, women can feel as you’re one of the only men they can connect with.

""If I can give the guys a tip about hooking up with a girl successfully - Girls LOVE compliments from a guy. But we learn this from childhood. If some stranger comes up to you and randomly says nice things about you, you know that he is a convicted sex offender [laughs]...

If you thoughtlessly hand out compliments, girls will AVOID you. So, how do you give out compliments the RIGHT way?

For example, HJ, ""you have a very pretty face, a hot body..."" those will never hit HOME well! She might be uncomfortable with you. ""Is this guy hitting on me? God no!'

What guys NEED to say is... you DON'T mention about what she ALREADY has, but mention about what she HAS done TODAY to make her pretty and look hot. For example, ""HJ, your clothes match so well with you today!"" ""your white color choice looks perfect on you today!"" ""did you have your hair done today? I love the new cut!""  -  You have to compliment a woman on the effort she has put on TODAY.""

1) If I've been talking to the girl for 5-15 minutes in a club/bar (loud environment) and she's smiled (genuinely), I will go for the kiss. Always. In the last week I've made out with 7 women in 3 different nights. I've been rejected twice, and I've made out with one of them a few minutes later, and the other one who rejected my kiss ended up chasing me all night around the club. 

I have NEVER had that rate, and I haven't changed anything about me in the last couple of months (actually as I'm typing this I realize that's a lie, I started meditating 20 minutes a day). But anyways, I now realize that going for the kiss is always the smart decision (if she's flirting with me and if I'm unsure if she's single, I ask her what her boyfriend thinks of something or whatever, if she replies that she doesn't have a boyfriend I interrupt her and kiss her as she's saying it).

*I've also been employing this new method of starting a make out. I mention that my wingman is my boyfriend or that my boyfriend is getting drinks, look at her shocked face, then go for it. 

2) I now always ask girls that I've made out with for a while to come home with me for a drink. This might seem like a normal progression thing for experienced guys, but it took me a whole year to learn to muster up the balls to ask this question, and so far no regrets. If she doesn't come home, I get the number and call her a few days later.

All this stuff is starting to click together for me (it took a good year), so for the guys still struggling, all I have to say is stick with it, MEDITATE, and Lift and it'll work out.

I figure it's great practice, as they're right there, I don't really get out much, and if I make a fool of myself (which can actually be great practice in its own right), I only have to see them 30 more seconds or so usually. So I'm not opposed to doing anything especially ballsy.

Anyway, the other night I'm at a stoplight. Just me and another car on the road. I look over and see it's a cute chick. I smile. She smiles back. The light turns green. We get to another stoplight. We exchange smiles again. At the third stoplight (I probably shouldn't have waited 3 lights to do this, but cut me some slack), I flash her the ""call me"" symbol just for shits. She mimics it, looking confused, as if she's saying ""how?"" So then I roll down my window. She rolls down hers. I know I only have seconds so I don't waste time. ""Hey, what's your number?"" I ask with a smile. She immediately gives it to me. We exchange names and go on our way. She's been blowing up my phone the last 2 days and I'm going out with her this weekend.

The moral of the story: Flirting for nothing other than fun (and to get comfortable flirting) can lead to unexpected things. Most of the time it's just a confidence booster (even if she says no, who cares, you worked up the confidence to do it, it's a win in your books), but once in a while, as in this case, you can get some pretty interesting results.

I met a girl (HB8) through her roommate(HB8) almost 3 weeks ago.  We all went out on the town on Nov 30th and had a really good time.  We went back to their place and had a discussion in which the girl that I had just met told me she wasn't really attracted to me.  I told her that I appreciated her telling me and that there were no hard feelings about it.

Fast forward 11 days and she's naked on her bed in front of me.  And god damn is she sexy!!

Let me explain a little bit.  I've always felt like the ugly guy, the pathetic guy, the NICE guy.  I've always been there for people who need me and taken care of everyone while not taking care of myself.  About a year ago, I decided to start giving a shit about me.

I dumped 90% of my band shirts.  I started finding clothes that fit me.  I began to hit the gym and tell myself how good I looked every morning.  I started going out every weekend with a buddy, sitting on a barstool &amp; we would just observe.  After a couple times of going there, I started dancing.  I am terrible at dancing, but damn I was out there dancing!  At the time, I didn't care if I got women or not, I was having too much fun just being myself - and people noticed.

I started speaking to women.  It was daunting at first, but after a few times it got easy.  They're normal people.  It seems so weird that I even have to type that but some guys put them on a pedestal and act like they're from another planet.  All spring, summer &amp; fall I worked on myself.  Improving my hygiene, my personality, but MAINLY my attitude towards myself.

All year I've been doing this and it was beginning to get frustrating because I had never gotten anywhere but talking but then the confidence boost came.  I began to actually BELIEVE myself when looking in the mirror and telling myself how attractive I had become.  How fun of a person I was and how no one could turn me down.  I started walking into the bar like I owned the place and speaking to girls like they were my best friend before we even said a word.  It is unbelievable what believing in yourself can do.

Ok, back to the main story.  So these two girls and I went to sex toy bingo (they give the toys away as prizes) a couple of days later (Dec 5th) and had a lot of fun.  As we were leaving I said ""Alright, make me look good now"" and I put my arms around both of them as we were leaving.  The cheers I got were unbelievable and even the DJ calling out the numbers yelled out ""LOOK AT THIS GUY WALKING OUT, WOWWWW"".  Major confidence booster right there.  We went to another bar for ladies night and I decided I'd sober cab.  They both had a good amount of drinks and were both dancing on me at the bar and I took them home and dropped them off.

A few days later (Dec 8th) my buddy and I picked up the girl that ""isn't attracted to me"" and went to the bars again.  She got pretty drunk while I stayed sober (sober cabbing again) and she made it very apparent that the previous statement about not liking me was not very true anymore.  She was grinding on me like crazy and staring into my eyes.  Eye contact worked VERY well with her as she looked like I was driving her crazy every time we locked eyes.  I dropped my buddy off and then her and I went back to her place where she passed out on one of her two couches.  Dammiiiiiitt!!! lol

Alright, here's the pay off.  December 11th I shot her a text asking if she wanted to go to dinner.  She agreed and I took her out to a nice-ish restaurant.  Afterwards we went back to her place and watched two movies.  During the second one, she came over and laid on me while watching.  I started to rub her arm, and then her stomach and then her inner thigh...and then before you know it my hand is in her pants.  We had a little fun and then realized how late it was.  It was 1:30 AM and I had work in the morning.  I said that I should probably go and then I heard those magical words.  ""Yeah, you could go, or you could come to my room"".  As you can imagine, I was a zombie at work the next day.

I guess the thing I want to stress is that you cannot give up.  Giving up is the ONLY surefire way that something like this will not happen to you.  I am not saying that this is going to work on every girl because it probably won't, but it can happen.  I learned a lot from seddit and it has taken me a long way and I appreciate the hell out of you guys.  I feel like I've gone from Quasimodo to Hercules in the past year and I have no one to thank but you.

It took me A WHOLE YEAR but looking back, I wouldn't trade it for the world.

1354884771.0,575,self.seduction,14fwmb,Intro to Pick up,731,156,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14fwmb/intro_to_pick_up/,"Intro to picking up girls

I believe that thinking in terms of 'as simple as possible' is always key when it comes to being efficient and learning something as quickly as possible. Being successful with women can be seen as a complicated task but it's not. 

I think what is important in order to avoid getting discouraged is to focus on an outline of terms and ideologies.

One of these is that pick up is a numbers game:

Yes, this is one of the most important focus points. When it comes down to it, pick up is just a numbers game. Any beta, nerdy, scrawny, isolated, non-socialized, average Joe can get action as long as he is able to go out, make those approaches, get enough phone numbers and set up dates with the females who are most interested. 

It's really not rocket science. 

Becoming a pick up artist:

Now this is a controversial term that is always getting beaten down into the dirt. People have a very stigmatic view of what this is and see it as maybe trashy while other may view it as glamorous. My view is that there is nothing wrong with learning how to become better at attracting a mate. I think anyone that thinks that maybe this is creepy or odd has a lot of insecurities of their own that they are afraid to deal with.

The only thing that separates pick up artists from anyone else is the fact that they chose to embrace the numbers game and facilitate ways to increase their percentage of success through trial and error.

Good learning Approach(Day-Game): 

Day-Game: Meeting and picking up women outside of bars and clubs(Specifically during day time)

When getting into the game you might want to start out with Day-Game. The reason I think this is a good idea is because 1) it helps you get used to going up to women you don't know and 2) you will see that It's much easier to meet women during the day.

Quick Day-Game Lowdown: 

All you need to do is go up to a girl who is stationary or even walking toward you on the sidewalk of a busy street and say, ""Excuse me, I think you're cute. Would you like to get coffee sometime?""
When she says yes, simply pull out your phone and ask, ""Ok, what is your number?""

I suggest that you only set up a meeting with the girls who choose to text you back the most. Also make sure that you meet up as soon as possible.

The Abundance mentality:

One thing you will learn is that many women will flake. This is just part of the game. The average percentage of success starting out is around 5%. 

This means that you will have a sexual interaction with 5% of the women whose numbers you manage to get. So if you get 50 numbers then you will most likely do something sexual with 2-3 of them. 

As you get more experience then you will gradually notice the success rate start to elevate as well as your confidence.
So get used to this and make sure you never get too invested in one single girl.

Logistics:

In the beginning the best way to get some action with a date is to meet them as close to your place as possible. You never know when you will hit the jackpot and find a willing girl who is content with a steamy night of passion.

Setting up a meeting point that is an efficient distance from where you wish to get some action is known as setting up the logistics. 

When starting out I suggest you keep the logistics relatively efficient. 
As you get better then you can play around meeting further away or even going to the girl's place.

However I prefer to bring it home simply because I feel more comfortable in my own bed and can enjoy a better night sleep after the interaction.

Looks:

looks are a very debatable issue. Many say that looks matter but I don't believe they are completely necessary. 

Through my experience I've realized that most women will find even the most simple characteristics, such as eyebrow shape a good enough reason to meet up with a man who is otherwise seen as unattractive and possibly sleep with him. 

However it is still important to stay moderately groomed and hygienic.

Neediness:

Another thing that is important to avoid is coming off too needy. However there is a fine line between confident and arrogant(cocky). Cocky in moderation can be stimulating but in excess it will quickly cause a girl to lose interest.

In order to avoid being needy you need think before you act. Ask yourself, 'Will doing or saying this fit my role as a man?'

Through my experience I have learned that what tends to keep a woman attracted is your ability to be independent. Don't be afraid to ask a girl to get the next round, don't think that you need to keep talking to entertain her, don't feel that you are obligated to text her, don't stop dating other girls, even if you get along with her, don't be afraid to lose her, don't be sensitive about what she thinks, don't need her, don't need her, don't need her!. However still be a gentleman and respectful. 

Conversation:

In time you will feel more confident in your speech. Yet to start out with you should pay attention to a few minor details to keep from reaching a dead-end. 

-Demeanor

Try to speak from your throat as opposed to your mouth. This will evoke a more manly and mature sounding voice.

-Speed of speech

Try not to speak too quickly. A nice moderate speed that gives you enough time to think will be sufficient enough.

- Ask questions

Ask her what kind of guys she likes, ask her if she has seen a movie that you liked, ask her what her goals in life are. Those are some good conversation starters.

- Stay positive

Avoid negative topics; stay away from traumatizing events, things you didn't like, people you don't like, gossip. Need I say more?

- Make statements

Tell her what she reminds you of, tell her that you like how the sky looks tonight, tell her that just saw an old friend from highschool that you haven't seen in years. These are all good examples of usable statements.

- Take breaks

Don't be afraid to go to the restroom, don't be afraid to check yourself out in the mirror, real quick, don't be afraid to turn and observe the room or bar where you're at. 

- Games

I have found that playing darts or pool can be a great way to bond with a woman. It's a good way to playfully tease them when they miss a shot and gradually get them to come out of their shell through laughter and joking. You don't even have to be good.
Women will be just as impressed with your ability to have fun as they would if you were an excellent pool player.

Signs of interest:

Things that you need to look out for are whether a girl is genuinely into you. The way it works from the start, 'she is either into or she isn't'. There is no convincing a girl to like you if she didn't from the beginning. It's pretty cut and dry on how to know this. When you realize she doesn't then you cut her loose and proceed to the next. If you don't then she will just waste your time and at the end of the date you will get nothing and be disappointed.

Some signs of interest are:

- Her touching you

If a girl's interested then she will look for excuses to touch you, whether it be grabbing your shirt or playfully hitting your shoulder.

- Big eyes

Another thing is something I like to call anime eyes. Her eyes will be big and shining and looking straight back into yours.

- Laughing at your jokes

This is obvious, a lot of times if a girl likes you then she'll laugh at your jokes, even if they aren't funny.

- Easy to hold her hand

This is key, an easy way to find out is putting your hand out and seeing if she's receptive to holding it.

- Easy to hug

Most girls, if genuinely interested won't mind you putting you arms around them and embracing them. Try not to do it too often though, if she is. It may come off needy. 

Also if she is ok with this then you might as well go in for a kiss.

- Her asking you personal questions

If a girl wants to know more about you then she is curious about you, meaning interested.

- Qualifying herself

This is when you tell her something about yourself and she says something about how she enjoys that too or that she always wanted to do something like that.
She is basically letting you know that you are good enough for her.

- her complimenting you on your looks

This is an obvious one. If she is telling you this then you might as well kiss her because she's game.

- Easy to kiss

Although, this doesn't mean that she'll sleep with you. It almost always means she is at least attracted to you. If you are able to do this then you should push for making out which will turn her on. 


Escalating to a sexual interaction:

Although lots of girls will generally allow you a sexual interaction if they agree to come back to your place some may not. Don't try too hard to convince them if they don't want too. 

I think the best thing you can do is run some basic tests and if this doesn't work then just tell them you need to go somewhere and send them on their way. If she texts you another time then she will most likely be up for going further next time. Make sure to meet her at the same spot and just walk back to your place directly.

Tests for escalating to sexual interaction:


1) While making out with her, rub her boobs and move downtown after rubbing boobs for around 30 seconds. Put her hand on your crotch and see if she grabs it and whether she starts stroking for you. once you've gotten her to do that then proceed to take of her pants.


2) If she won't let you take her pants off then at least try to get her to finish you off with her hand while making out with her. If she does then she will most likely text you another time and proceed further. 


3) If she won't finish you off with her hand then ask her if she can give you a massage. If she says yes then take off your shirt and have her massage you. If you work out then this might get her turned on. 

After 30 seconds turn around and repeat ""number 1"". It's possible that after the massage she may be turned on enough to proceed further, even though she didn't before.


*If she is resistant to all these then just forget about her. I don't bother with a girl if I am not getting all the way on the first interaction. I used too before but now I don't think it's necessary. 

You can get action from another girl just as beautiful or even more beautiful. No reason to bother with the one playing hard to get. 

-Don't be afraid to lose the girl. A well-known Pick up artist who goes by the alias Mystery said a great thing that you should never forget;

""You must be willing to lose the girl before you can get the girl.""

If a girl really likes you enough then there shouldn't be any resistance. That's what it all comes down too. Only give to those who want to give back.*

So that covers the introduction. Feel free to send me any questions or thoughts. All the best.

I'm on Seddit to work on my confidence and social skills.  That'll probably help me get girls as well, but my story is about a job interview.

It has always been counterintuitive to me to introduce myself to strangers if I don't have a specific reason or goal.  Seddit says ""Talk to everyone"" though, and after some practice, I decided to apply this principle very liberally at a job interview (btw if you haven't read [Talk To Everyone](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ckut1/talk_to_everyone/) then do it immediately).

Among the many seemingly irrelevant people I talked to (i.e. they are not interviewing me, they are just around) was the receptionist at the front desk.  I arrived about 20 minutes early, but instead of sitting there like a chump staring at my phone pretending I have some important text to read, I introduced myself and was able to keep the simple, shallow conversation going long enough for her to... get excited and tell me about the office and show me some cute party invitations she was making.  And she started telling me about her life.  For the record, she's 20+ years older than me.  HBimjustnotinterested.

I talked to low-level folks, middle management, and top brass.  I was finishing up my short interview with the head of a department in which I could potentially be placed.

An aside: the head-of-department mentioned, unbidden, that I have good social skills.  This is alien territory for me, and probably new since I started reading Seddit and Dale Carnegie.

Anyway, the head-of-department was walking me back through the office, to reception, to wait for one more interviewer.  While we were waiting there at reception for a couple minutes, I started chatting with the receptionist again.  She was happy to see me, and showed me her progress on the invitations.  The head-of-department looked at me like ""what planet are you from"" so I just turned to her and said, pointing back and forth between me and the receptionist, ""We're friends now.""

That was a show of confidence and a huge DHV.  It also would have been impossible if I didn't TALK TO EVERYONE.

You never know who is going to be the linchpin in getting you what you want.  Over time, opening people has started to get fun for me, but if that doesn't motivate you, fucking do it anyway, because you could get a job out of it.

1336523820.0,570,self.seduction,tdur1,[FR] Hilarious situation at a nude beach turns into a threesome,702,132,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tdur1/fr_hilarious_situation_at_a_nude_beach_turns_into/,"So I'm hanging out at the nude section of the beach in Barcelona.  Just chilling, letting my cock get some sun, and enjoying the scenery.  I had been there for a while and I was thinking about leaving pretty soon to get some food when 2 HB7's came and chose a spot fairly close to me and got naked....so of course I opted to stay for a bit longer.  Now these girls had only been there for about 5 minutes when this creepy black dude (CBD) came over.  He was dressed in baggy jeans and a baggy jacket, so he looked completely out of place at the beach (I think he may have been one of those Kenyan dudes you see selling sunglasses in touristy areas).  Anyway, CBD sits down about 5 feet away from the HB's and just stares creepily.  Naturally, the girls get uncomfortable and motion for him to leave, but he ignores them and continues to stare.

This is when I have my moment of brilliance.  Without directly addressing the HB's or CBD, I nonchalantly go over and sit directly between them and get into a [David Hasselhoff pose](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_33w7ZrQXPBI/SQM7TZVr7PI/AAAAAAAAA6U/okMJC5MwHFA/s400/hasselhoff.jpg) facing the dude.  The HB's love this and start giggling, and CBD is visibly annoyed - I do my best to keep a straight face and act nonchalant.  Pretty soon CBD gets up and goes to the other side to get a clear view of the girls, and again I follow him and sit between him and the HB's.  At this point the girls are laughing pretty hard, and we have become the center of attention for this section of the beach. After another minute or so of staring at my dick, CBD decided to give up and go search for greener pastures.

So there I am, completely naked, sitting next to two naked HB7's who are still laughing at the whole situation. I decided to take the opportunity to turn towards them and introduce myself.  Upon hearing me speak, they ask where I'm from and I tell them I'm from the US.  Well it doesn't take long for the conversation to turn sexual because the next thing one girl (we'll call her HB1) says is:
""If you are from US, why you are not circumcised?""
""Wow, do you ask every American guy that question as soon as you meet him?""
""Haha noooooooo, but I can see yours so it is ok to ask.""
""Hey, my eyes are up here!  Don't be staring at my cock!""

We continued with the playful banter for a while (I'm mainly talking to HB1 since HB2's English wasn't as good, but both girls are acting extremely warm towards me) and eventually we got onto the topic of female pubic hair, since HB1 was completely shaved and HB2 was trimmed.  They asked me which I prefer (I interpreted this as an extremely loaded question, but I would like to hear your opinions on this as well) and because I didn't want to choose between the two options that were right in front of me, I said that I prefer a giant pubic afro, and it makes me sad that not many women sport that look anymore.  Luckily this made them laugh and we moved on.

By the way, up until this point in the conversation I'm using every ounce of my effort to not get a boner.  I'm using a trick I know to pump blood to my fingertips (you just ""focus"" on your hands and they'll start to slightly throb - try it) and I'm also intermittently glancing over at a nearby group of old naked men.  Well, HB1 finally asked me why I kept looking over there.  I couldn't really think of anything clever to say, so I decided to answer honestly and see how they react.

""I'm looking at those guys so that I don't get a boner.""
""Hahahahaha we don't care if you have boner, you can have boner if you want.""
Hoooooooly shit, with the way she said this and with her accent, this is one of the sexiest things anyone has ever said to me.  So with her saying this, and me no longer trying to prevent it, my cock started to grow.  And as soon as it started growing, they both started staring at it, which of course just made it grow faster.  Well, pretty soon I've got a raging boner and the HB's are staring at it and giggling.

My second moment of brilliance: ""So...do you guys want this for here, or to go?"" They looked at each other and girl-coded, and then HB1 said ""After we are finished here, you want to come to our flat?  It is very close."" HOLY FUCK, my cheesy line actually worked!?! Trying to contain my excitement a bit, I replied ""Sure, we can do that.  I don't have any other plans."" So we stayed at the beach for another 20-30 minutes or so, most of which I spent flipped over so I could hide my boner, which of course the HB's found hilarious. But eventually we packed up our stuff and started heading to their place.

Man, they weren't lying.  Their apartment was literally a 5 minute walk from the sand.  Once we got inside, HB2 said she was going to take a shower, which was great news for me since at this point I was only going to try to bang HB1. So I ask HB1 which room is hers, and she leads me in there and I close the door.  We instantly start making out and ripping each other's clothes off. I've already seen her naked so there is absolutely no LMR as I undress her. I'm in.

A few minutes later I'm going down on HB1 and HB2 comes out of the bathroom and into HB1's room (both bedrooms were connected to the one bathroom). FUCK! Cockblocked, I thought. However instead of the reaction I expected (HB2 shocked, HB1 embarrassed) they both seemed extremely calm.  They said something to each other in Spanish, and then HB2 TOOK OFF HER TOWEL AND WALKED OVER AND LAID DOWN ON THE BED NEXT TO HB1! I'm not a religious man, but I swear to god I heard fucking church bells at that moment!  So instead of just f-closing HB1, a fucking threesome had just fallen into my lap!  Hallelujah!

1371491417.0,570,self.seduction,1gj117,Why Men Have the Power During an Approach,724,154,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gj117/why_men_have_the_power_during_an_approach/,"Who has the power during the approach? The woman, of course. She has the choice to accept or reject the man who has approached her, or worse, to reject him with vengeance. She is the gatekeeper. She can open the gate, keep it shut, or pour boiling oil on your head.

At least, that’s the conventional wisdom, and not without reason. That certainly is how the interaction appears, but I’m going to put forth the case for men holding the power in approaches. But first, you need to be familiar with two concepts from negotiation theory, the Ultimatum Game and BATNA.

Fair warning: This post is long, and there’s not a tl;dr at the end. But, if you can’t spend a few minutes of your day learning how social dynamics work and why they work that way, maybe that explains your continued virginity.

**Ultimatum Game**

The Ultimatum Game is a classic experiment in negotiation theory and behavioral economics. In it, two players must choose how to divide up a sum of money, let’s say $100. One person plays the role of the Offeror (O) and one the Offeree (E). O will make a proposed split of the money, and E is left with only two options, to accept or reject the offer. No other communication is allowed, he can’t say what terms he will accept ahead of time, and cannot make a counter offer. If E accepts, the money is split as offered. If E rejects, neither side gets anything and they both walk away empty handed.

A purely rational E should accept any offer that O makes, regardless of how small. If O proposes a $99/$1 split, that sure seems unfair, but E’s options are $1 if he accepts, and $0 if he rejects, and $1 is more than $0, so it’s in his interest to accept.

But that’s not what happens. If the offer is too low, E will feel insulted, cheated, and want to punish O, and he will therefor reject the offer. $1 is a cheap price to pay to keep your dignity and to teach O not to be such a greedy bastard.

Without communicating, O will probably intuit that E would reject an offer that is too low. After all, that’s what O would do. Now the question is just how much does he needs to offer in order to get E to accept. E will always accept a $50/$50 split, and most people in E’s position will accept down to about $20 or $25. O wants to hedge a little bit, and is likely to offer something around $60/$40 or $65/$35.

What’s this got to do with approaching? As the man, you are the Offeror, offering the pleasures of your conversation. The woman is the Offeree, deciding if she wants that pleasure or not. Further on in the interaction things will be a lot more complex, and there are plenty more chances to reject, but at the very first line, the true opening, her only options are to allow the conversation to continue, or immediately reject you.

It seems like she has all the power, but as we can see from the Ultimatum Game, the Offeror always comes out ahead, or at worst ties the Offeree. The Offeree has some power, but the fact that the Offeror typically comes out ahead (usually getting $20-40 more) means that the Offeror is in the stronger bargaining position.

This translates nicely into social dynamics quite well. She has the power to reject an approach, but you have the power to decide if she gets approached at all.

**The Pie’s All Wrong!**

In the Ultimatum Game, you’re deciding how to split a pie of predetermined value (we used $100 above). In seduction, that of course isn’t how it works. You have the value you bring to the table, she has hers, and you’re offering to swap. You have 70 to offer, she has 85, you make the offer, and there’s an 85/70 split in your favor. Why would she accept that? Because, just like the in the Ultimatum Game, getting 70, even if unfair, is still better than rejecting the offer and getting nothing. That’s why you can see guys who are 7s picking up girls who are 8.5s.

So then why do so many 3s and 4s get consistently blown out, even by girls who are just 5s and 6s? Why instead of taking the 60/40 split do they reject it and take nothing? Because they aren’t actually getting 40 subjective units of seduction value. They see the guy not as marginally attractive, but rather as repulsive. For them it’s more like a 60/-20 split. They’d rather have nothing than go into the red. (Of course this isn’t purely about looks, it’s a total package assessment, or at least as much of the total package as can be assessed form an opener.)

What we’ve learned from the ultimatum game is that your opener will be accepted if (1) she sees the interaction as an improvement on her evening, and (2) you don’t insult her. In the Ultimatum Game insults come only in the form of ridiculously small offers; in seduction it’ll be more in the form of something like rattling off a line that’s plainly rehearsed rather than trying to interact with her as an individual. She might think you’re an attractive guy and witty enough to come up with the line, but you’ve wounded her pride, and she’ll blow up the offer just to get back at you.

And now I think the Ultimatum Game has been done enough, and we can move on to the other concept, which deals with the fact that you two aren’t the only guy and girl in the universe, and not even the only ones in the venue.

**Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)**

I hate the acronym, but it’s the one commonly used in negotiation theory, so I’m going to stick with it. (I hate it because it should be the expected altnernative, not the best alternative since the best option isn’t necessarily guaranteed.) Just think of your BATNA as your fallback option if you get rejected. If it’s a typical bar crawling Friday night, your next best option is to approach another woman in that venue, or venue change and find someone in the new place. So, your BATNA is pretty much just the exact same thing, minus 5-15 minutes of lost time. That’s one heckuva fallback position. Just imagine trying to negotiate a raise with your boss — and imagine than your BATNA is an offer at another company across the street with the same salary you’re earning now. Not too shabby.

Now consider her BATNA. If she rejects you, what happens? Maybe she’ll be approached by another guy. He might be more attractive, he might be less attractive. Or, maybe no other guys will approach her at all. Because most women don’t have the social toolbox to make an approach, she’s left in a very precarious position. She’s not guaranteed a second attempt with someone else the same way you are.

You don’t need a PhD in Behavioral Economics to see that the person with the better alternative is in the more powerful position. To you a rejection comes with minimal cost, to her it can be substantial. The fact that she has the ultimate Yes/No decision making power on the surface looks like she has all the power, but the totality of the circumstances, the fact that you can go elsewhere and she cannot, really puts you in the stronger position.

In certain venues, the power will shift back into the woman’s hands. It’s a busy club, plenty of time before last call, she’s the tall blonde turbogirl, and you’re not particularly attractive. In that case she’s better off rejecting you because the alternative is that she’ll likely be approached by a more attractive guy.

In smaller venues though, and with girls who don’t have their bitch shields at 200%, really all you have to do to get the set to hook is make the approach, don’t insult her, and be more interesting and attractive than the prospect of spending the rest of the evening alone.

**The Take Away**

Approach Anxiety is, has always been, and always will be one of the biggest hurdles in the community, if not the single biggest, and it affects everyone from AFCs to experienced guys.

Understanding the actual power dynamics in an approach though can help you to overcome that anxiety. You’re not entirely at the girl’s mercy, you have options, and she’s the one who really has something to lose by rejecting you. That’s a very empowering thought to have as you make your approach. …Now if only you could figure out what to say.

1349013835.0,557,self.seduction,10pkqj,20 Life-changing things I learned from Robert Glover's book 'No More Mr. Nice Guy'  ,693,136,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/10pkqj/20_lifechanging_things_i_learned_from_robert/,"First, let me preface this by saying that I used to pride myself on being such a nice person. I still think that being nice on some levels is important and there is no point in being a dick for the sake of it, but Glover's book goes so much deeper than this. 

A typical Nice Guy is someone who:

* Puts others' needs above his
* Tries to be perfect and hide his flaws
* Is not respected and gets taken advantage of
* Is afraid to take risks and challenge himself 
* Is uncomfortable expressing what they really feel or think

One of the most interesting parts of this book was Glover's talk about 'childhood abandonment experiences'. Most Nice Guys had a distant father-figure in their childhood. Children naturally become distressed at not having their emotional needs met, and thus as a survival mechanism they try to eliminate their needs in order to receive love in return. However, if this quality sticks around into adulthood, it can cripple your professional, social, and romantic relationships. Humans are naturally selfish to some degree, so it is incredibly unhealthy if you approach relationships with an expectation that putting others first will earn you love or affection.   

All in all, I highly recommend reading the book for yourself (I'm sure someone can find the ebook online and post a link to it). I can't tell you enough how much this book has helped me to recognize what has been holding me back from getting what I want. The alternative to being a Nice Guy is not to be an asshole, but instead to be someone who is self-assured, empowered, and goes after what they want.

**BUILDING MERE EXPOSURE**
 
Opening, hooking, and getting their contact details with upwards of 100% success rate is possible. The reason this is possible is because I learned how to turn it into a hard skill. Hard skills are something you can learn to do, repeat the sequence of steps, and have success nearly every time. Soft skills are more like an art where you learn the structure, practice it, and every time you finish you'll have a slightly different outcome. Think painting a picture. Some will be better than others, some will be complete shit, and others will be a work of art. That is a soft skill. Anyway, opening, hooking, and closing is a hard skill following the proper sequencing. Now that being said, that doesn't mean you'll have attraction or the number won't flake. That's where non-verbals, preselection, and all the other aspects of “game” and attraction comes into play. More on that later. For now I just want to cover the sequencing I spoke of a moment ago:

 

1. Mere Exposure
2. Opening Lines
3. Trigger a smile
4. Approach
5. Qualifying Statements
6. Disqualifying Others
7. Ask an Opinion
8. Lock In!


One of the most important rules of indirect game is to never make it feel or seem like you're hitting on them. The two main things that give away your intentions is poor delivery and shoddy body language. If you're delivery is off at best you'll look like you're hitting on her, possibly try-hard, and at worst just plain creepy. Just keep that in the back of you mind when doing these since you don't want to give the impressing you're hitting on them. You want it to feel like you're just two people having a peasant chat or small talk, bullshitting as some call it, and not actually an attempted pickup. So many guys telegraph way too much interest and their intent is clear as day. So how do you hit on them without hitting on them?

Pre-open. When you first hit the venue do what is known as pre-opening. This is when you do a brief approach, exchange names, and leave them on a high note. Doing so should last no more than a few seconds. You're in, out, and gone. This really trips them up because you're actually walking up to them, talking to them (only guys that hit on them do this, right?), but then you leave! That can't be right? If you're hitting on them why did you just walk off? You know what they're thinking, “Hmm... maybe he's not actually hitting on me after all.” If they automatically assume you're hitting on them, which most will, especially during night game, this will really throw them off guard. That's how indirect game should operate. However, I'm getting a little ahead of myself. Before you can walk away you first must approach them. There are several different types of openers and the 3 I want to focus on are Functional, Compliment, and Observational (aka Situational) openers:

 

* Functional openers are the easiest and most socially acceptable openers to use. However, they're the toughest to transition from. An example of a Functional opener is “Do you have the time? I think my watch is running slow.”, “Do you know if there are any good specials here tonight? I'm getting tired of the same old xyz.”, “Do you know where the bathrooms are? I can't find them anywhere and my friend is about to make a mess!” and so on.
 
* Compliment openers are just as they sound. You give a compliment, exchange names, and you're gone. An example of this would be, “That's a great dress. I like how it makes you stand out from the crowd.”

* Observational openers are just as they sound. You're commenting on the environment around you and are the most powerful as it creates a commonality and are spontaneous. As I mentioned above you don't want to give the impression of hitting on them, and observational openers have a tendency to do that as they can come across as try-hard with bad delivery. Instead of talking to the woman about whatever it is you're observing, talk about it to your friend (wing). Then you bring the woman into the conversation by what should seem as happenstance because she just happens to be the one standing there at the time your conversation took place. Now because you were already discussing it with your wing it's not hitting on them, but just conversing with someone else nearby about that cool or strange widget you just noticed. An example would be “&lt;wing&gt; check that out! Look at that picture and this one over here. (Said to the woman...) Do you see that? They're all the same pictures, they're just different color! I wonder how many people even notice that? Weird, huh?”


There are three main rules when doing a pre-opener:

   1.  Justify why you're talking to them. Those familiar with Neil Strauss' style of game would call this “rooting the opener”. Same idea really. If you look at the example's I gave for each opener they all have a justifying statement included.
   2.  Always exchange names and do a handshake if able.
   3. Tell them it was nice meeting them and/or to have a good day/night, then eject politely.


Once you've done 15-20 minutes of pre-opening in the venue your mere exposure effect should be climbing. And I do want to say that pre-opening is not the same as warm-up sets. While warm-up sets can raise your mere exposure effect, they're not the same since pre-opening keeps it brief and it's not an extended duration conversation. Anyway, after that short time of pre-opening, now it's time to start approaching earlier women you pre-opened. Scan the venue for women you've talked to and use non-verbal communication to get them to smile. I've found almost 100% of the women I've pre-opened will smile when doing this. Congratulations, when they smile at you they've just given you an approach invitation! Yes fellas, it's that simple. What do you do when they give you that approach invitation? It's simple... you lock eye contact, keep smiling, and go straight in.

1361814704.0,559,self.seduction,197aqt,A little advice for those of you struggling with AA/Why openers don't matter.,681,122,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/197aqt/a_little_advice_for_those_of_you_struggling_with/,"I was very active on this sub about a month back, became a little less active as I practiced what I'd learned and now I'm back to learn even more. One post I stumbled on not too long ago was one about being shameless and I wanted to elaborate on that a little more.


I see a lot of posts and questions asked on here about ""coming off as an asshole"" or ""being a pig"" and I think a lot of people don't understand the difference between being shameless and being an asshole.

I'm not going to really hit on the ""just fucking do it"" aspect because everyone here says it, but to really kick your AA you have to just approach. I still get nervous every time I approach, the only difference is I don't let it stop me. I take it as fuel to my fire. I love the rush and anticipation I get before approaching that HB8 that just walked in the room. I love never knowing what a girls response could be. It's a mystery. 

Once you just start approaching you'll start to love the rush you get. Sometimes the rush I get from just approaching new girls is better than taking her back to my place for the night.

I had an approach last week that turned out to be pretty successful. I was in our university cafeteria and  was waiting in line. A HB7 walked up behind me and I thought, ""what the hell, why not?"" so I turned to her and just said the first thing that came to mind. I smiled, made eye contact and pointed to the silverware rack, chuckled and said, ""Lots of spoons, ehh?"" She looked a little puzzled, smiled and said, ""Oh yeah, kind of a weird place for all those, isn't it?"" and conversation just went from there. I got her number and she came and partied with us this past weekend. I wasn't worried about getting laid, I made a new friend and she's chill as fuck.


Guys, I opened by saying ""Lots of spoons, ehh?"" Fucking **spoons**. I got her number because I was just me. I wasn't trying to think up some crazy, cheesy one liner or some pick up line, I literally just said the first thing that came to my mind. Girls aren't aliens. They're fucking people! Just approach girls naturally, being yourself and everything will just go as planned.


But back to the part about being shameless. I feel that being shameless means to do things you want, not letting peoples opinion hold you back. We get these premeditated thoughts about what will happen if we approach a girl and those unrealistic scenarios keep us from finding the real results.

*""What if she thinks I'm weird?""*
*""What if she thinks I'm ugly?""*

What if you quit being a loser and just approach and let her come up with her own opinion of you instead of the unrealistic, preconceived one your mind has created? You have nothing to lose!

When you approach girls, be shameless. Give zero fucks about what others think, what her friends think, or really what she thinks for that matter. If you approach a girl and she immediately blows you off that's her loss. You're life is awesome. You're awesome! You're being different and approaching girls like a man, being straight forward and real. You're not using cheesy pick up lines, you're being chivalrous. If a girl doesn't want to be part of your awesome life, who cares? That's her loss!

I approached a girl yesterday with, ""Excuse me, I don't mean to startle you, but you are absolutely gorgeous and I'd love to take you out for coffee sometime."" She responded with the more uninterested, unenthusiastic, ""..Thhhannkkss...."". I followed up with, ""Are you always this nice to guys who go out of their way to compliment you?"" and she actually laughed and we talked for a bit. I got her number, but don't plan on setting anything up cause she was a real bitch. 

Most guys wouldn't have come back with a somewhat mean response like I did. I was shameless. I guarantee she didn't expect that response. I didn't care though, I was just doing me. That wasn't an asshole response, it was a shameless response. An asshole response would have been, ""Well, someones a bitch."" and walked away. Instead I responded with a question and one that initiated a response.


Things to remember/learn when approaching:


1. Be shameless - Go out and just have fun. Don't hold yourself back because of what others will think. Do things because you know they're only going to better you. Rejection betters you. You actually build up a shameless attitude about it. I don't even care if I get rejected anymore because I know there's so many more girls waiting to be approached and half the other guys out there are too scared or worried to approach them.

2. Let the nerves be fuel to your fire. I love the rush I get from approaching. It's almost addicting. I approached two girls yesterday, got shot down by both, but I didn't let it dent my confidence or shatter my mood. 

3. Realize the feeling of ""what if"" is worse than the feeling of rejection. Nothing sucks worse than going home and saying ""I what what would of happened if..."". At least if you get rejected you know you tried. I always remember this when I'm feeling some AA.

4. Remember that you're unique. You're different. You're awesome. Girls aren't used to a direct approach. Be you. Let girls see you're an awesome guy and you're not like the rest.


I realize this post was kind of scattered out, but I felt the need to write something up about this. By being shameless you start to feel more confident. You start to actually enjoy talking to women and people in general. You start to **actually** enjoy life. This sub has seriously changed my life completely. These past two months have been an absolute roller coaster of fun/craziness/insanity and I love it. It's not about getting laid, it's about finding yourself. Being you. Enjoying every single day. The people of this sub are awesome and I give ten million thanks to all of you!

I can't stress this enough and I can't stress how many times I've accidentally done this and completely reversed otherwise failed/friendzoned approaches/relationships.   **This is the #1 most powerful tool anyone in this community can give you if you understand the implications.**   If you've never been in a serious relationship before then this might not be that helpful.  

-There's no anxiety to approach, she's your girlfriend.

-There's no need to info/data-gather/mine.   Who cares?  Assume you know this shit already.   

-You feel more comfortable; she feels more comfortable.

-Silence is fine.  

-She feels like you can be her boyfriend; or better than her current boyfriend.  

-You lose your outcome dependence.  You stop trying to impress, succeed, etc.  It's not about ""her"" anymore, it's just ""you"" having fun.

So how do you do this?  Here are three examples which have gotten me laid within 24 hours.

(me laying on a girl's bed in hotel room, was sent to get her, getting ready for a wedding reception)

her: let's go.

me:  one second let me finish this text.

her: (fixing make up) you came here to get me, now im ready...

me: we'll be fine.

her: ....and well be late.

me: yeah but were awesome, so, who cares. 

her: ooookay then.

me:  alright you ready?

her: yes of course im ready.

me: alright lets go (hand on her back leading her out the hotel room 
door).  you look good.   

her: thank you :)

me: were leaving if theres no alcohol right?  fuck receptions with no booze.  

her: umm yes, fuck that.  i dont know anyone and alchy is the only way i'll be able to survive.

you see?  no lines, no weirdness, no pick-up-hypnosis, or palm reading, or whatever.  but i can get away with acting like her boyfriend because i did it from square one.

(me with random girl in grocery store)

me:   really? frozen green beans?

her: what?

me:  i don't want those.  (vomit face)

her: welllllllll? uhmmm YOU don't have to eat them?

me:  yeah but can't we agree that there are yummier things in this place?  like thin mints or something?

her: omg, i agree thin mints are delish, but green beans are healthy!

me: (shake head in disgust) i need help me finding raisins .  fuck me, (hint hint) im retarded.   are they a dry good?  a fruit?  or a snack?  i can't find them.

her:  (laughs)

me: (taking her greenbeans out of her hand) you're coming with me.  we're on a raisin mission.

(me sitting down @ table w/ random girl in a coffee shop)

me: hey do you see that guy?

her: who?

me: that guy over there, he is just sitting there, is he homeless, should i get him something to eat? or is he just chilling in a starbucks for no reason?

her: (trying to dismiss) he's probably just chilling.   he's fine, i wouldn't worry about it.  

me: you're probably right.

(awkward silence)

her: soooo why are you sitting here?

me:  (Shaking head) look, i think hes only in here to warm up.   we should help him.  ill buy the sandwich if you buy the drink.   

her:  .......................................................................................okay....ill give you the money i cant leave my stuff here...  (again trying to dismiss me for good)

me:  (nodding as i stand up and take her money)  deal, (wait for her to get money, take it)  james, by the way (extend hand).  

her: (she gives her name, shakes hand), nice to meet you

me: one second. (go to buy the guy some food &amp; drink, return to her table afterwards)


notice that, only after you've established yourself as ""with her"" should you start asking for details and get into that boring process, why?  because then it's actually SEXY for her and for you....these stand out as 3 examples where this tip is very applicable, it's not a style of pickup, but it has been a very successful tool on the path to being a natural for me, i hope you can use it as well.

Here's some thoughts.",649,107,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1d4di4/to_all_those_wondering_how_on_earth_do_i_fake/,"Everyone has approach anxiety. What I finally realized last night is that the key to all of this is *outcome independence.*

Here comes a ramble...

I went through a phase of thinking I couldn't talk to girls because I wasn't a 6'2 beautiful rugby player. Having seen guys much less attractive than me get with girls, I next thought that my problem was being boring, anxious and not being naturally talkative. After reading seddit for a while I learned that it's all about confidence but this didn't really help me. I could puff my chest out, take up space, talk loudly etc. but I still couldn't just say 'Hi' because I just had no idea how to fake confidence.

Last night I figured it out, I think. Game isn't about seeing a crowd of girls, picking one, then saying something clever and going through the steps to sex without being shot down along the way. You don't see a girl and think 'what should I say?' you see a crowd of 20 girls and just say hello to all of them.

This sounds intimidating. Saying hello is difficult. You will feel all sorts of anxieties and you'll worry about what they'll think. But realize that if you just say 'hello' or something similar at least half of the girls will shrug you off and won't be interested. This is fine. This will happen whoever you are and whatever opener you use.

But the girls who don't shrug you off will be delighted that a guy came and said hello to them. They've been stood there waiting for a guy to smile and say hello to them, that's what girls do on nights out. They make themselves look and cute as they can and they wait for guys to come and say hello. If you say hello they will get all the same anxieties you just had in the corner with your beer. They'll be worrying what you think of them, worrying what to say next, hoping you don't think she's boring, hoping you don't think she's weird. Anxiety is human. It's normal.

I'm going off topic here.

Let's say you smile and say hi to 20 girls in a college bar. Here's what happens:

10 of them will politely say hi back but won't really be interested. The conversation will be slow and awkward and you'll parts ways very quickly. She'll think you were nice but for one of many many reasons she just wasn't interested.

2 of them will get an ego boost from shooting you down. They are attractive and they know it and it gives them pleasure to say no to dozens of guys. Fuck them.

The other 8 are delighted you came and said hi and will try and push the conversation along just as you are. They will be trying not to embarrass themselves, they will worry that an awkward silence will cause you to leave. The two of you will have a conversation that steadily becomes more comfortable.

If you are Brad Pitt then this 10-2-8 ratio turns to 2-1-17

If you are wearing an ill fitting T-shirt and old jeans or you have weird unkempt hair or you say hi but mumble it while staring at the floor then this ratio turns to 17-2-1

So try this:

**Find out your ratio.**

That's it. That's the goal. The goal is not to get a number or a dance or a kiss or a fuck. Not even to get a conversation. Your goal next time you find yourself in the corner clutching your beer is to go and say hi to 20 girls with the sole intention of seeing what happens

You don't actually care whether or not they like you. You realize that about half the girls will politely say no and that won't embarrass you, it just teaches you more about yourself.

You will probably fail this task.

Well before you get to 20 girls you'll have met someone cute who laughed at your silly comment and got on well with you. You'll never find out the ratio because you won't leave this fun interaction for the sake of completing a task. The point is to start with the mindset that you a approaching a girl to find out about her, not to impress her...

Right, sorry for all that, I hope it made a bit of sense. The key point is that once you don't care about the outcome of the interaction, you'll naturally be more confident and talkative and your anxiety will just melt away. You aren't approaching a girl to try and pull her. You are approaching a girl purely for the sake of it...

One more time:

The key to all this is not 'confidence' it is Outcome Independence.

First post, criticism welcome...

**Edit:** When I say 'say hi to a girl' I don't mean literally say hi and stand there. What I mean is just make a very simple opener. Could be as simple as a smile, as long as it's genuine. If she smiles back, say hi and ask what she's drinking, ask how she knows the host, ask how her night has been, mention that it's crowded in here, say *anything* just keep it simple. The more complicated and witty you try to be, the more anxious you'll be saying it.

If you try to come up with 20 different witty comments for 20 girls, you'll have anxiety when approaching because you'll be convincing yourself that your opener is lame. The great thing about a simple 'hi' opener is that it's just normal. No one will laugh at a guy saying 'hi.'

These are all things I did a lot, and had had decent success with all of it. However, I always felt a bit of emptiness in my interactions with women. I would tease them, attract them, and eventually close, but I knew there was something missing. I didn't realize what that was until this weekend.

First a little background. 18 years old, just graduated high school. Met this girl at another school's prom. Didn't really try anything because she and I both had our own dates. Fast forward to a few nights ago, and I see her at a party. We hooked up, but I was completely smashed. It eventually got to the point where I couldn't even speak. Needless to say I don't remember shit, but I was without a doubt a fucking mess. Regardless, I texted her the next day asking to meet up at the beach. For reasons unbeknownst to me, she agreed. (seriously, even I would've flaked on myself after that performance)

Once at the beach, I realized that every time I teased this girl about ANYTHING, she would legitimately believe it and feel insecure about it. I felt so bad that I began trying to open up with her. Getting her to speak about why she views herself so lowly (she was literally adorable), and throwing out genuine compliments.

The result of doing this was astounding. We actually formed an incredible connection. And it sounds cliche but it really did fill that emptiness that I'd felt in my previous hookups. After our little date, she texted me ""I kinda wish we got to know each other a while ago and not right before you leave"".

I should also note that when we began hooking up on the beach, the first thing she said was ""I've had sex in the ocean before. I'm not having sex with you though"". I smirked and replied ""Ok"". I didn't push things too far in that hookup because a friend was waiting on us. However, after that meetup and a few texts exchanged, she texts me out of nowhere (completely irrelevant to the conversation): ""I want to have sex with you"".

I met up with her last night and we had a sick fucking time. She told me she's never had a guy treat her that way. 

That really resonated with a book I just finished reading, Mark Manson's Models. In it, he describes how he's had multiple girls ask him to take their virginity, other girls tell him that a one night stand with him meant more than entire relationships. This is EXACTLY how it felt with this girl. 

When you get over the obsession of attracting and maintaining a cool frame, you realize that it's all about one thing: leaving them better than they were before you met them.

I've been dealing with AA alot lately and the other day I said fuck it, I drove to a mall far from where I live. I did this so that no matter how bad I fucked up, I would probably never see those girls again.

Once there, I approached girls with the stupidest, most random shit ever... This is what the average conversation went something like

Me - Hey, can I tell you something

Her - Yes?

Me - I like chairs

Her - What the fuck? hahahah I like chairs too

Me - What else do you like?

Her - I like random guys having random conversations

blahblahblah ended up getting her number, made her laugh a couple times, cute chick too

Another girl I went up to and said I can read palms (obv bullshit) and asked if she had time for me to read her's, she agreed. I basically read her palm and told her she'd meet a handsome guy in a mall who had a special talent, then she'd get with him and have octuplets, she laughed, and I told her I was BSing and that I thought she was cute so I had to come talk to her, and since we're already holding hands she should give me her number, **BAM** another #-close

Another girl I randomly went up to, no hello or anything, asked her ""batman or superman?"", that started a whole convo about superheroes and shit which I'm guessing she was into, got a hug and a #-close

All in all, I can't believe all this random shit worked... I always thought you had to be super smooth and seductive to get girls, but all I did was be a confident version of myself and say whatever came to my mind, no hesitation.. and it worked.

Obviously I have a long way to go, but I just wanted to post this to give you guys an idea, if you have AA just go out and be retarded, say stupid random shit to girls, they will laugh, guaranteed, dont go in hoping for a number, go in to have fun!

Its a personality test that a psych professor gave her class during an orientation. She called me up immediately after the class to give it to me. Girls love this shit. Everyone loves this shit. 

Make sure you have a piece of paper(or bar napkin) and a pen. 

""Hey! My sister taught me this personality test she learned at psych class orientation. Want to take it?""

Hand them pen. 

""What is your favorite animal, and list three qualities you like about that animal. 

Next..

What is your favorite color, and list three ways this color makes you feel, or three qualities you like about this color. 

Next..

What is your favorite body of water, and list three qualities you like about this body of water.

Lastly..

Close your eyes, and Imagine that youre sitting in a chair in the middle of a bright white room. There are no windows and there is no door. List three ways that this makes you feel. ""

When they're done, go over their list with them:

- The animal represents how you would like OTHER PEOPLE to view you, or, the qualities you HOPE other people see you as possessing.

- The color represents the way you SEE YOURSELF, or the qualities you WISH TO POSSESS.

- The body of water represents your IDEAL ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP, and the qualities you hope that it has. 

and, lastly, the room represents the way that you VIEW DEATH. 

Enjoy! I've been doing this with all my friends and girls I've been meeting. EVERY ONE OF THEM has a lot of fun with it and has written the process down because they want to do it with their friends. Its a great thing to do when the conversation is tanking and it's a great way to offer value and most of all its FUN. 

Also - you can easily transition to talking about they're favorite body of water and sharing a vacation story or two. Just DON'T talk about death! I've made that mistake and it's weird.

I felt like seeing these stories was teaching me about how pick-up is different for everyone, how sometimes it really just depends on the girl, and other various things that helped me realize there are no ""rules"" or ""guides,"" and there is more than one way to build attraction. However, as of late the FRs are lacking for several reasons. I think we should acknowledge that this isn't the place to go brag about your victories. Think about us sedditors being football analysts, we wouldn't have a newscast that just tell us ""Packers won, it was awesome,"" would we? The game would be broken down and we would determine *why* the Packers won. 

Many FRs I have read lately go into more details about the close than the pursuit. [This thread](/http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/w39tq/fr_interstate_lovin_a_tale_of_victory_first_post/) made me decide to voice my grievance to see if I was alone in this. This isn't r/sex. In fact ""__-close"" is all I need to know how well your game worked, no need for the nitty-gritty. Furthermore, I don't think this user is all that special for getting his cum swallowed by a strange woman at a hotel bar that was probably cheating on her boyfriend. It even says ""a tale of victory"" in the title, and OP didn't tell us how he came to be victorious.

Another post that was kind of alarming was [this one](/http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/w3339/fr_hooked_up_with_hb8_while_bf_was_in_another_room/), where OP came off as a total selfish dick. 

The PUA community is about self-improvement, so tell me how stories like these are improving us? It is easy to mindlessly upvote an entertaining story, but if posts like these stay on our front page, we will develop a (justifiably worse) reputation as a bunch of bros circle jerking about who we fucked (or in some cases fucked *over* to get what we want). I want seddit to start downvoting FRs like this. We don't need mods to censor posts that aren't up to par, but we do need to get back on track as a community. Our goal isn't to share our awesome sex stories.

This was all before finding Seddit and looking back I realize now that I was, as Tyler would call it, a ""chode."" 

We decided to go out front for a smoke, where we ran into a homeless man who asked if we could spare a cig. We all said we couldn't, because we were being bombarded by people trying to mooch a smoke. Well, we got into a conversation with him that gave me my first taste of how to really approach women. 

The first piece of advice he gave me about talking to women was, ""when you go up to a girl, talk to her like you've known her your entire life."" I thought this was brilliant, because it makes both parties more comfortable. I asked him to demonstrate for us.

Keep in mind this was an older homeless man with no front teeth. I didn't expect it to work, I just wanted to see it in action. He walked up to an HB8 on her way to a club and says ""Girl, you look good in those heels, how much did they cost? I'm not sure if it is just the way you wear them or what, but they look expensive."" 

The girl, surprised that she just got properly hit on by a bum, just smiled, said thanks, and continued walking.

Then his second words of wisdom came as a result of that experience. He looks at us and says, ""Girls are like buses, you miss one, you just catch the next one.""

After joining Seddit, doing research, and taking proper action, I still think back to these two quotes when I start to think too much. If I get rejected, I just think to myself, ""time to catch the next one.""

### Premise 
The word [seduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduce) has two meanings either **""to lead astray""**  or **""to attract.""** It is up to the individual to choose what he wants to do with the information given.

The seduction community was establish because there's a need for men to have a dialog. 

What men usually have among his close friends is typical of this dialog:  
Guy 1: My relationship is not going great... any advice?  
Guy 2: That's too bad, let's have another beer!  

The dating advice that are traditionally given to men in this modern age does not typically work. The community is a peer group of men that talks about what works, and what doesn't work. It can range from creating attraction, being passionate about life, handling situations, how to handle relationships, dating, sex, confidence issues, rejection, etc.

People who read seddit can range from people who's just looking for single girl that he could have amazing relationships with, to people who want to have sex as many women they want, to people with low confidence (being rejected that really affected the person, divorced, depressed, no father figure, etc) or did not not have many women around them to interact with (long term relationships, lives in rural area, etc). Therefore, understand that many people who read seduction materials can have vastly different reasons why they want to do so.

If you use the ""Me too"" comeback for I have a boyfriend you will probably get a response from her...  
**""Are you gay?""**  
Say.. ""No,"" smile, and follow up with...  
""Then again, I'm gay, can I touch your boobs now?"" (position your palm close to her breasts but obviously not touching, yes I've done this and you will not get slapped as long you have the correct frame/confidence)

1367197083.0,522,self.seduction,1db1fl,Billy's Guide to Learning Pickup,697,175,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1db1fl/billys_guide_to_learning_pickup/,"The first thing a newbie needs to understand about learning pickup is that it is a process. You’re going to build up a core of skills, and it’s only after reaching a certain level of competence that you’re really going to start being able to have fun, fulfilling interactions which may lead to a great long term relationship.

A lot of guys come in with the idea that they’re just going to learn a trick or two or a strategy to get this one girl that they’ve been going after, and once they do that they’re done – no need to learn anything else, mission accomplished. That’s setting yourself up for failure. Imagine standing up to bat before a major league pitcher and trying to figure out how you’re going to score a run. It doesn’t matter how good you’re coached about swinging, you’re not going to hit the ball. You probably won’t even swing until it’s in the catcher’s glove. And even if you did get a piece of it, if the ball isn’t immediately caught, you’re not going to be fast enough to round the bases.

Back in the old days we had the saying that to get one girl, you need to be able to get any girl. You need to learn to hit any pitch, you need to be run fast in general. If you want to attract that one girl, you really need to learn how to be generally attractive, and how to attract just about anyone.

**Focus on Process**

Easiest way to get discouraged is to go out, open a set, get ignored, and then slink back into some dark corner and vow never to approach another girl again. You got a bad result, and that deflated you. The problem is you focused on the result. I’m not going to say to not care about the results, because that’s a pretty superhuman bit of psychology there. It’s hard to control what you care about, but you do control what you focus on.

Focus on the process. If you’re intimidated by clubs or the thought of going out solo, then make your goal for the weekend to get to the venue Friday and Saturday nights. Once you’ve done that, make your goal to open a few sets. At this stage of the game, success really is determined just by putting forth an effort. Doesn’t matter if you get any hits, what counts is that you’re showing up to the batting cage and swinging at every pitch.

Even as you get more experienced, you should still focus on the process, because that’s the one thing you really do control. You shouldn’t go out and say your goal is to get 5 numbers. It should be to try to number close 5 girls. Don’t go out with the goal of making out; go out with the goal of going for the make out.

**What the Process Looks Like**

A lot of guys will hit plateaus. You’ll go out, open sets, get more comfortable, be able to open consistently, and then you’ll find you’re just not getting any better. The problem is that your process probably sucks.

When you go out to the bars and clubs, you need to be committed to putting in about 4 hours, and doing that two or three times a week. It takes a while to get warmed up – at least one set, but often two or three. It’s only after you’re warmed up that you start to make progress. Try going to the gym, stretching, and then going home. See how much stronger you get.

When you stick it out for hours, you get something that’s a bit like a runner’s high. You get in to the experience, you get comfortable with the surroundings. You feel good and want to keep going. And, you force yourself to open or else spend the next 4 hours bored out of your mind. There’s some nice motivation.

It’s also best to go out more than one night a week, preferably back to back if your schedule allows. You’ll have some residual state from the last night, get into the groove much quicker, and that will allow you to progress much more than you could have if you waited a week between outings. Plus, you’re not getting any younger.

**Be Patient**

This shit takes time. You’ll have some periods of rapid progress, and some plateaus. Sometimes you’ll even have setbacks, especially when things in the rest of your life interfere. And not everyone progresses at the same pace. Some people will learn a few outer game skills and become gurus almost overnight. Everyone starts from a different place, learns at a different rate, and has different goals. Stick with it, and approach learning pickup with the expectation that at best it will take about 6 months to really be decent, but that you should expect it to be closed to 2 years. Sounds like a lot of time, but compare it to how long it takes to get decent with a musical instrument, or to speak a foreign language. And, think about how long term the payoffs are. Not to mention, it’s not years of drudgery. You’re going to have a lot of fun along the way. And by fun, I mean fooling around with girls.

**Take Care of Your Shit**

Get a job, clean your room, get in shape, learn to dress (and smell) like someone girls want to have sex with.

This really cannot be stressed enough. The more you improve the rest of your life, the easier pickup will be. You don’t need to make fitness and bodybuilding your number one hobby. You do need to make fitness something you think about though. Eat healthier, exercise more. It’s really that simple. You’ve probably know lots of girl who’d be really attractive if they just lost a little weight. Not that much, maybe 10 pounds. It works both ways. You’ll feel better, project a better energy, your clothes will fit better, and you won’t have to quit having sex after two minutes because you’re not used to doing pushups. Also, drink a lot more water. 2-3 liters per day. Not only will you feel better, you’ll lose fat quicker, and your hair and skin will look better.

There’s too much to say about fashion for this post, so I’m just going to say to get a full length mirror. Look at yourself in it. Style is really personal and subjective, but get clothes that fit, and actually take a few moments to consider how you look.

You also need to keep your home presentable. Every time you go out, have a home you can bring a girl back to. If you know you can’t pull because your place is a mess, you’re going to have that in your subconscious and it’s going to hinder your game.

Finally for this part, get some hobbies. I read a lot, I write, I volunteer with a non-profit, I listen to Fresh Air, Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me and A Prairie Home Companion, and I cook a lot and like to learn about food and cooking. Pick whatever hobbies you want, but try to have something that is either hands-on or creative. It’s easier to attract girls when you’re an interesting person, plus you’re going to be much more relaxed and less needy when you have other sources of enjoyment in your life. Likewise, cut down the amount of time you spend watching trash TV, playing video games, and otherwise being completely unproductive. You don’t need to completely eliminate these things, but they shouldn’t be the biggest thing you’ve got going on.

A lot of guys have shit lives and are hoping they can find a girl who makes everything great. You won’t find that girl. She doesn’t exist. And, it’s not fair to expect a girl to polish your turd of a life. Become a whole person, one that’s just in search of another whole person to share the adventure with.

**How to Ask for Advice**

You’ll hit lots of stumbling blocks along the way, and you will need guidance. Unfortunately, 90% of the questions that get asked are completely idiotic. They make three big mistakes. They don’t give enough information, they ask unanswerable questions, and they lose sight of the process. Let’s go through these one at a time, starting with the second, then the third, then the first.

Unanswerable questions. “Why didn’t this girl call me back?” No one knows. We didn’t see your interaction, we weren’t there, we’re not in her head. There are a thousand different possible reasons for everything, and while experienced guys can offer some likely explanations, no one will ever be certain.

Asking about specific interactions like that is stupid because, and here’s the second problem, you’ve lost sight of the process. You’re trying to analyze one interaction when you need to be thinking in terms of bulk interactions. You’re asking how you could have hit this one pitch, when you need to be focusing on how to improve your stance and swinging motion. Think about your interactions in groups. Are you hitting the same problem over and over again? That’s what you should be asking about. Not how to solve one specific interaction that went poorly, but how to react to similar situations in the future so that you improve your odds. You’re not trying to hit that 1 ball 100% of the time. You’re trying to hit 50% of the next 10 pitches instead of 20%.

Lastly (but originally firstly), too many guys asking for advice about specific interactions fail to give all the details. Now, I’m not saying this because I want you to write a lengthy question with every tiny detail. Well, actually I do. I just don’t want you to submit it. Without the details, obviously no one can really give you good advice. But you’ll find that when you start filling in the details you’ll discover what went wrong. Once you know the basics, you’ll be able to think your way through these things. Take the time to do that. If you need to, write out a description of what happened, being as detailed as possible. You’ll almost certainly discover what the problem was. That’s incredibly powerful. There is nothing better for learning pickup than being able to answer your own questions, and when you’ve trained yourself to analyze your own interactions, you’ll get better at it, and you’ll get faster. You’ll get so experienced with it that you’ll be able to see what’s going on in real time, as you’re interacting with the girl, and that’s when your game will go to the next level. But, if you post bare bones questions and make other people trying to help you get vital information like they’re pulling teeth, then you’re just never going to get better. A big part of the game is learning how to think about your interactions, and you can’t get better at that by asking other people to do it for you.

If you can’t figure out what went wrong despite looking at it from every angle, go back to the second thing. Is this going wrong a lot? What do all those interactions have in common? There’s your answer. And if it’s not happening a lot, then who cares?

**Your Excuses Suck**

You can’t find time. You don’t drink (you don’t have to, btw). You don’t like clubs. You’re too ugly to ever love. Whatever. I’m not going to argue with you. You’re absolutely right. Enjoy never getting laid.

I understand Seddit has had a large influx of new subscribers recently, and it seems as though many of them are downvoting because they disagree with the moral choice of the person posting.

[Here's an example of what I'm talking about](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vz2dz/girl_told_me_i_was_beautiful_and_said_i_could_get/c58vfmb), from the current top post. Woman tells guy she has a boyfriend, and anyone who suggests he escalate anyway is downvoted into oblivion.

I thought Seddit was not about making moral judgements on people's decisions. Even if a girl does legitimately have a SO (which was not clear in my example link, it seems like it may have just been a shit-test), and even if you personally would not escalate in such a situation, I think we need to allow the input of folks who would to be seen.

In my mind Seddit is about finding the path to being true to yourself and attaining your earnest desires. For some of us, that may be gaining enough confidence with women to get into a monogamous LTR with the girl of our dreams. For others, it may be simply f-closing a different woman any night they go out.

If a girl wants to cheat on her boyfriend, she's going to cheat on her boyfriend. *Some* of us don't care to be that dude (myself included), but some of us don't really give a shit. This should be a place where both opinions are valid, as long as the person voicing them is being true to who they really are...

**Flirting**

In his excellent work, *[Models](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1463750358/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1463750358&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=xmmx-20),* Mark Manson defines flirting as: *Expressing your sexuality to a woman in a non-needy manner, eliciting her to become more attracted to you.*

Let's break that down. *""Expressing your sexuality""* means you are clear with your intent. You are speaking to her because you find it fun and you think she is attractive. A direct statement of interest certainly accomplishes this, *""You are beautiful.""* But so does good body language. Holding strong eye contact while you discuss politics with her is as clear a statement of interest as there is.

*Non-needy manner* should be familiar at this point. You are speaking with her because you *wonder what she is like.* Does she fit your qualifications in a girl? Go find out! That's being non-needy. You're not hard up for sex, you're just figuring out what she is all about. Curious minds want to know.

Flirting done correctly will cause her to *""become more attracted to you.""* That's the name of the game.

There are two basic forms of flirting: *breaking rapport* and *leading.* Breaking rapport is anything that shows you are willing to risk rejection. Leading is when you, as man, directly dictate the direction of the interaction.

Any time you tease, do something unexpected and spontaneous, say something surprising, or act dismissive, you are breaking rapport.

*Examples of Breaking Rapport:*

* **Push/Pull** (Giving a reward then taking away, repeat ad nauseum. Example: *""You're really beautiful, Natalie. I think you're the third hottest Natalie I've ever met.""*)
* **Vocal Inflection** (Lowering your inflection as opposed to raising your inflection at the end of sentences. It's the difference between *""Wow, you went to Brown University.""* and *""Ugh, you went to Brown University?""*)
* **""Reality Destroyers""** (Something incredibly spontaneous and unexpected to the point where her brain short-circuits a little. Examples: *picking a girl up in the air for no reason, messing up her hair, telling her she's ""Such a bro,"" [Angel/Goddess Technique](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fdji6/fr_new_pickup_strategy_discovered_angelgoddess/)*)
* **Physical Push/Pull** (Push/Pull with physical twist added. [Example here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/f6ve5/fr_tofutofus_physical_pushpull_as_an_opener_short/))

Leading is when you, as the man, make a decision about where an interaction will be heading. She expects you to push the interaction forward. That is your job. You always risk some level of rejection when you try to change the flow. That demonstrates a willingness to walk away which is inherently attractive and non-needy. That is flirting 101.

*Examples of Leading:*

* **Touch** (You are physically leading the interaction forward)
* **Roleplaying** (You are deciding to play a game and allowing her to play with you.)
* **Changing venues** (You decide where to go next.)
* **Making decisions** (You decide what to order, what to do, etc.)
* **Treating her like an old friend** (You are deciding to treat her like an old friend even though you just met.)

As a general rule of thumb, **not taking yourself too seriously, and staying self-entertained,** will allow you to maximize your attractiveness and pass any ""tests"" she may throw your way. Keep that in mind.

---

**Touch**

Touch, also known as *kino escalation,* will be your bread &amp; butter. You MUST get comfortable touching others if you expect to get good with women. There is no way to fake the act of touching.

Because it's so important, Part 7 of this guide is almost entirely dedicated to physical escalation. But between now and then, you MUST get comfortable touching girls. Start basic, offer handshakes and high fives to people like they're going out of style.

When you or the person you're talking to says something funny, touch them on the forearm when you laugh. It's perfectly natural and establishes that you are comfortable touching.

Decide arbitrarily to move to another section of the bar, or park, or wherever you are. When you do, put your hand on the small of her back. *""Come on, let's move over there.""* or *""Let's go check the other side of the bar out. Come on.""*

Try to hold hands, or sit her on your lap. Let your legs touch each other under the table as the sexual tension builds. Force yourself to get comfortable doing it - there is no way around it.

---

**Conversation**

Your conversation skills are important but not the be all, end all of pickup. There are master orators, hypnotists, comedians and storytellers who rely almost exclusively on their words to get laid. But here's their big secret: they turn most women off rather quickly.

They speak when they should listen. They're entertaining when they should be seducing. They are building up to a punchline when they should be building comfort. In other words, they are miscalibrated.

As a man, it is your job to lead every interaction with a woman. You want to find something you can both speak passionately about it and run with it. Find commonalities. Ask questions. Get her opinion on all sorts of things.

Do not be afraid to call out a conversation as boring and change the topic. That's *leading* and that's flirting 101. Here is an example:

&gt; You: How were your classes today?

&gt; Girl: Not bad. 

&gt; You: Cool. Any plans for the summer?

&gt; Girl: Not yet... *looks away, disinterested*

&gt; You (*recognizing the situation*): You know, this conversation is boring. Let's talk about something more exciting.

&gt; Girl: What?

&gt; You: Yeah, let's mix it up. Here's a question for you... Why is Japanese porn so weird?

&gt; Girl: LOL what? Uh...

&gt; You: Seriously, they do the most depraved things ever and then blur out the genitals so it's supposed to be OK or something.

&gt; Girl: You know a lot about Japanese porn, dude.

&gt; You: Yeah, I was a world-class masturbator when I was 13.

&gt; Girl: LOL

&gt; You: Hah bet you never thought you'd be discussing my middle school masturbation habits, huh?

&gt; Girl: Hah can't say I did.

&gt; You: Anyway, walk with me a second, I need to check on something.

I chose this example because I'm a guy who wants girls who are comfortable laughing about topics like porn. I spent time reflecting on the qualities I like in a girl (As listed in the section on Qualifying Women in Part 4) and want to make sure any girl I speak to is okay with that. I also quickly turned a boring conversation to a hilarious and sexual one with just a few words. **""This conversation is boring. Let's talk about something more exciting."" &lt;-- your new best friend.**

That's being spontaneous, unique, and leading in one fell swoop. Try it out sometime. Develop your own ""routines"" and use them egregiously. Figure out what conversation topics make you smile. Try to be different. **Be polarizing and use your conversation as a way to qualify a woman's compatibility.** Remember, you're trying to find out *what she's like.* Don't be afraid to scare incompatible women off. That's a GOOD thing.

---

**Comfort Building**

Just remember, at some point when you are talking to a girl, you MUST build a certain level of comfort or she will not feel comfortable sleeping with you/dating you. Sure, talking about porn is great, but you'll need more than that to find a girlfriend. Entire books have been written on comfort building methods, but I'm going to share my secret with you.

In addition to finding common things you like or have experienced (commonalities), play a quick ""Getting to know you"" game and bring up these three topics:

1) A time when you were really embarrassed

2) A time when you were really scared

3) Your relationship with your parents &amp; your parents' relationship

It has been scientifically proven (by [Dr. Arthur Aron](http://aron.socialpsychology.org/)) that those three conversation topics lead to high levels of comfort between individuals. You will each feel like you have shared a very vulnerable side and you will have more respect for one another because of it.

---

**Action Items**

(NOTE: Don't worry about rejection. You're just practicing different things, there is no reason to have any expectations on the outcomes of these practice interactions. Loosen up and have fun! Also, this is the part of the guide where different people will require vastly different time to accomplish all the steps. Some people can do it in a week, some will take a couple years. The important thing is to NOT GIVE UP. The rest of your life depends on it!)

1) Go out to a high-traffic venue that you are comfortable in. Approach 10 different girls or groups of people, keeping in mind the proper body language and approach practice you did in [Part 3.](http://redd.it/1dd13a)

2) Try to get them engaged in a conversation. You can stick to something situational (sports news, current events) or something observational (*""Wow, it's impossible to get a drink in here.""*) The topic doesn't matter because you are just there to practice touching the girls you are speaking to. Prepare to spend the first 5-10 minutes doing the bulk of the talking until they open up to you. (This is normal.) Offer a high five or handshake. Next, wait for a moment of laughter or delight and touch them lightly on the forearm.

3) Make a conscious effort to try both *breaking rapport* and *leading* forms of flirting with them. Tease, give a playful shove, try to roleplay (*""Let's pretend we just got married. Wait, are you cheating on me? Shit, are we gonna have to get divorced? Oh man I better call my lawyer."" trollface*) Practice lots of different things and figure out a style that works for you. This may take a while but it's a lot of fun while you're trying things out.

4) When you find girls who are receptive to your flirting, try to move them to a place where you can be alone and chat. A line like, *""Suzy, I want to get to know you better. Let's sit at the bar.""* works wonders here. If you can't get her alone, try to get her phone number and set up a date so you can talk then.

5) Make an active effort to use the comfort building items listed above. Get experience doing these with at least 5 different girls.

6) Write field reports for all of these interactions and take the community feedback to heart.",Comprehensive,False,,t5_2qhrv,1368733838.0,,,True,t3_1di9xu,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1di9xu/above_the_game_part_5_flirting_touch_conversation/,moderator

[Link here](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/f8ejp/iama_mpua_interview_series_1_questions_savoy_of/)

Hi guys. So seddit has topped 15,000 users! Quite the achievement, wouldn't you say?

To celebrate this milestone, we will be introducing two brand new features which we hope will bring our community to the next level. We feel seddit is the most vibrant and promising seduction forum on the internet, and we're going to try and keep it that way!

**FEATURE #1: Locally based sedditor lairs**

With over 15,000 users, many located in the same cities, we feel it's time to facilitate more real world meet-ups. We will be launching with Los Angeles and Tokyo as the pilot lairs, with the hope that others will grow organically. If you would like to establish a lair for your area, please see if there are any interested people in your local community and contact the seddit moderators for further details.

The idea was presented to us by sedditor withClass to establish a Los Angeles based sub-seddit. You can find it at [/r/LosAngelesSeddit/](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesSeddit/). 

The Tokyo lair will be located at [/r/TokyoSeddit/](http://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoSeddit/). 

For now, all lairs will be featured prominently on the sidebar, too.

These semi-private communities will allow for easy management of logistics for meetups and discussions. All field reports and strategy developing in these lairs will be posted into the main seddit, cross-posted for archival in the sub-seddits. Time to find some wingmen, gentlemen!

All those interested in joining the Tokyo lair, please message me, [TofuTofu](http://www.reddit.com/user/TofuTofu/). All those interested in the Los Angeles lair, please contact [withClass](http://www.reddit.com/user/withClass/).

**FEATURE #2: ""IAMA mPUA"" Interview Series**

Yes, we're finally at critical mass to have some of the better known mPUAs (master PUAs) visit our seduction forum. Thanks to SpiderFan for the idea and for EvolutionTheory for organizing the first interviewees.

There's a whole body of knowledge and experience these masters of seduction can share with us, so it's time to get those questions brewing. We get to pick their minds and they get to showcase to us what they have been up to in the seduction community at large. (Don't worry, seddit isn't selling out. This is strictly them volunteering their time, so please be cordial and give them a shot!)

Our first guest has been confirmed as [Savoy](http://www.lovesystems.com/team-bios/savoy) from [Love Systems](http://www.lovesystems.com/). We will allow approximately one week for questions to be up/downvoted and the top ten questions will be sent to each mPUA. In addition they will return for a live IAMA session approximately one week after the initial thread goes up.

I hope you guys are excited for this as we are! More details to follow soon once we confirm the dates with the mPUAs.

If any of you have connections to mPUAs who might be interested in doing an IAMA, please reach out to the moderators here for details. We are actively seeking more interviewees.

We hope to have this as a regular feature on seddit, but the first one with Savoy will be the pilot, so we ask for as much involvement as you can give us!

Lastly, the sidebar WILL finally get that overhaul soon. If you have any unique ideas for how to do it, please contact the moderators.

1332284822.0,516,self.seduction,r5u09,Conveying Sexual Intent Early On: How to Avoid the Friendzone,633,117,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/r5u09/conveying_sexual_intent_early_on_how_to_avoid_the/,"Hey guys.

This is an important topic that I believe is a sticking point for many of you guys. I'm here to share a simple hack that you can do to help you qualify women, and help them see you as a potential sexual partner and not just a friend.

**Conveying Sexual Intent**

If you can convey that you are interested in her physically early on, you can establish a sexual frame. Think of a sexual frame as the lens that she sees all further communication through. It makes it clear that you are looking for a sexual partner and not just a friend.

Direct game is one way of doing this. You guys probably have heard this before.

Example: *""Hi, I had to stop you. You're absolutely stunning. What's your name?""*

---

But I want to show you a simple hack that you can work into your approach, no matter what style of game you run, to set a sexual frame and build sexual tension.

I have two versions I use that work well.

**Version 1: ""You're My Type""**

This one is simple. Just mention off the cuff that one of the girls you're talking to is your type. I like, ""I'm really glad you're cool because you're totally my type."" This plants the idea of you two ending up together in her mind. Make sure to say it slowly, deliberately, with strong eye context. Touch the small of her back if you can. Make sure she sees you're not just saying it randomly, but that you actually mean it. Afterwards, continue with your conversation like normal. 

**Version 2: Physical Compliment**

After you've opened, but within the first few minutes of conversation, give her a compliment on her looks. (**It's important to note, do not do this as the opener unless you plan to run direct game and know what you're doing.**)

I like to hold her hand for a bit during the introduction handshake, look her in the eye and say ""You've got such soft skin."" Pause for effect. Resume conversation like normal.

You can say anything that conveys that you find her physically hot. ""Your eyes are absolutely stunning."" or I even have been using ""It has to be said, I fucking love your cleavage.""

Honestly, it doesn't matter as long as you make it clear you see her as a potential sexual mate.

I know this seems redundant because YOU already know you have sexual intent, but girls decide early on whether you're going into the friend pile or the sexual mate pile. Make sure she knows which pile you're going into.

---

There it is. Simple as pie. Convey sexual intent no more than a few minutes into your approach and watch your friendzone/flake rate drop dramatically.

Good luck out there, guys!",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_r5u09,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/r5u09/conveying_sexual_intent_early_on_how_to_avoid_the/,moderator
1345250327.0,513,self.seduction,yemm3,"I'm a girl, and I think some of the PUA techniques are bad news. Hear me out.",1058,545,501,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yemm3/im_a_girl_and_i_think_some_of_the_pua_techniques/,"Hey all. I've been skimming through this subreddit after having found out about it a few days ago, and most of the stuff in here is legit. It seems to be more about feeling better about yourself/confidence than anything, and that is important whether it's for picking up girls or just being a happy person.

But some of the PUA techniques are ridiculous, and seem like they would cause more harm that good in most cases. I think I need to start off by explaining what girls are taught from birth in our society.

We will never be pretty enough. We will never be skinny enough, or have long enough eyelashes. Our tits are too small, too oddly shaped, or sag too much. We are what is left over after all the supermodels and movie stars are taken. Seriously. 

Also, we are taught that guys only want one thing. And we are taught to defend that one thing because if we (gasp) like sex, then we are freaks and sluts and should be treated with less respect. 

So you have all of this going against you when you approach a girl. Even if she is smoking hot and has great boobs and perfect ass, there is still a high chance that she has a self-esteem issue and even higher chance that she is going to pretend she doesn't want to go home with you even if she does.

Okay, now that being said, imagine you come up and talk to this girl. One of the techniques that just kills me regarding PUA is the negging. Really? You have to passive-aggressively insult a girl, who probably has self-esteem issues anyway, in order to make her lower her self-esteem some more? You don't need to do that. Don't do that. Just be honest and if she looks good, tell her so. Then, if she acts like a bitch, tell her she *was* hot until she opened her mouth. 

And don't use any of the underhanded ""tricks"" to get a girl to feel like she should sleep with you. If a girl puts her trust in you because you seem ""different"" or because you acted like you wanted more than just a one night stand in order to get laid, then you ditch her the next day, do you know what you are doing? You are creating more low self-esteemed women who are going to think twice about trusting any man again. And you wonder why women go psycho? :P

On the same token, it can't be doing you much good, psychologically, to know that you were anything less than honest with any girl about your intentions. You just wanna fuck for one night and then never talk to her again? Don't act like you'll call her, and make it okay for both of you to be fine with this. I would have been much more likely to go home with a guy who was like ""Hey, you and I could have fun tonight with no strings attached."" than a guy who was like ""I think I love you.""

Just something to keep in mind. I know it isn't easy for you guys, and I don't envy the pressure society puts on you to be the assertive ones.

One more thing: Most girls know about the PUA stuff, and would love nothing more than to call you out on it and make you look stupid. The reason is because it seems so disrespectful to consider girls ""marks"" and such. Confidence is great, cockiness is a turn off. (And yes, sometimes lack of confidence can be even more endearing than you think, as long as you are genuine.)

I'm no expert, but I have personal experience being that girl in the club or bar or whatever, so if you want to tell me I'm wrong or stupid, have at it. Just thought I'd pass along some info. :)

**Edit: Wow, this is great. This has probably been the most educational information I have seen about what negging is about/for, and the viewpoint of it all from your perspective. Yes, most of my information came from older information, I have been out of 'the game' for 4 years, so maybe a lot has changed since then.**

**I want to reiterate that I was never trying to say that it is harder for women than men, or that women have more barriers to their confidence. Quite the contrary, and I apologize if it seemed like that was what I was saying.**

**To most of you, thanks for the insightful comments, you've done a great job of explaining it. I see things a bit differently, now.**",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1345301784.0,,,True,t3_yemm3,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yemm3/im_a_girl_and_i_think_some_of_the_pua_techniques/,
1343136061.0,516,self.seduction,x2ktn,Letting Go of Attachment -- From A to Zen,617,101,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x2ktn/letting_go_of_attachment_from_a_to_zen/,"“Most of our troubles are due to our passionate desire for and attachment to things that we misapprehend as enduring entities.” ~Dalai Lama

If there’s one thing we all have in common it’s that we want to feel happy; and on the other side of that coin, we want to avoid hurting. Yet we consistently put ourselves in situations that set us up for pain.

We pin our happiness to people, circumstances, and things and hold onto them for dear life. We stress about the possibility of losing them when something seems amiss. Then we melt into grief when something changes—a lay off, a break up, a transfer.

We attach to feelings as if they define us, and ironically, not just positive ones. If you’ve wallowed in regret or disappointment for years, it can seem safe and even comforting to suffer.

In trying to hold on to what’s familiar, we limit our ability to experience joy in the present.  A moment can’t possibly radiate fully when you’re suffocating it in fear.

When you stop trying to grasp, own, and control the world around you, you give it the freedom to fulfill you without the power to destroy you. That’s why letting go is so important: letting go is letting happiness in.

It’s no simple undertaking to let go of attachment—not a one-time decision, like pulling off a band-aid. Instead, it’s a day-to-day, moment-to-moment commitment that involves changing the way you experience and interact with everything you instinctively want to grasp.

The best approach is to start simple, at the beginning, and work your way to Zen.


**Experiencing Without Attachment**


Accept the moment for what it is. Don’t try to turn it into yesterday; that moment’s gone. Don’t plot about how you can make the moment last forever. Just seep into the moment and enjoy it because it will eventually pass. Nothing is permanent. Fighting that reality will only cause you pain.

Believe now is enough. It’s true—tomorrow may not look the same as today, no matter how much you try to control it. A relationship might end. You might have to move. You’ll deal with those moments when they come. All you need right now is to appreciate and enjoy what you have. It’s enough.

Call yourself out. Learn what it looks like to grasp at people, things, or circumstances so you can redirect your thoughts when they veer toward attachment. When you dwell on keeping, controlling, manipulating, or losing something instead of simply experiencing it.

Define yourself in fluid terms. We are all constantly evolving and growing. Define yourself in terms that can withstand change. Defining yourself by possessions, roles, and relationships breeds attachment because loss entails losing not just what you have, but also who you are.

Enjoy now fully. No matter how much time you have in an experience or with someone you love, it will never feel like enough. So don’t think about it in terms of quantity—aim for quality, instead. Attach to the idea of living well moment-to-moment. That’s an attachment that can do you no harm.


**Letting Go of Attachment to People**



Friend yourself. It will be harder to let people go when necessary if you depend on them for your sense of worth. Believe you’re worthy whether someone else tells you or not. This way, you relate to people—not just how they make you feel about yourself.

Go it alone sometimes. Take time to foster your own interests, ones that nothing and no one can take away. Don’t let them hinge on anyone or anything other than your values and passion.

Hold lightly. This one isn’t just about releasing attachments—it’s also about maintaining healthy relationships. Contrary to romantic notions, you are not someone’s other half. You’re separate and whole. You can still hold someone to close to your heart; just remember, if you squeeze too tightly, you’ll both be suffocated.

Interact with lots of people. If you limit yourself to one or two relationships they will seem like your lifelines. Everyone needs people, and there are billions on the planet. Stay open to new connections. Accept the possibility your future involves a lot of love whether you cling to a select few people or not.

Justify less. I can’t let him go—I’ll be miserable without him. I’d die if I lost her—she’s all that I have. These thoughts reinforce beliefs that are not fact, even if they feel like it. The only way to let go and feel less pain is to believe you’re strong enough to carry on if and when things change.


**Letting Go of Attachment to the Past**



Know you can’t change the past. Even if you think about over and over again. Even if you punish yourself. Even if you refuse to accept it. It’s done. The only way to relieve your pain about what happened is to give yourself relief. No one and nothing else can create peace in your head for you.

Love instead of fearing. When you hold onto the past, it often has to do with fear: fear you messed up your chance at happiness, or fear you’ll never know such happiness again. Focus on what you love and you’ll create happiness instead of worrying about it.  

Make now count. Instead of thinking of what you did or didn’t do, the type of person you were or weren’t, do something worthwhile now. Be someone worthwhile now. Take a class. Join a group. Help someone who needs it. Make today so full and meaningful there’s no room to dwell on yesterday.

Narrate calmly. How we experience the world is largely a result of how we internalize it. Instead of telling yourself dramatic stories about the past—how hurt you were or how hard it was—challenge your emotions and focus on lessons learned.  That’s all you really need from yesterday.

Open your mind. We often cling to things, situations or people because we’re comfortable with them. We know how they’ll make us feel, whether it’s happy or safe. Consider that new things, situations and people may affect you the same. The only way to find out is to let go of what’s come and gone.


**Letting Go of Attachment to Outcomes**



Practice letting things be. That doesn’t mean you can’t actively work to create a different tomorrow. It just means you make peace with the moment as it is, without worrying that something’s wrong with you or your life, and then operate from a place of acceptance.

Question your attachment. If you’re attached to a specific outcome—a dream job, the perfect relationship—you may be indulging an illusion about some day when everything will be lined up for happiness. No moment will ever be worthier of your joy than now because that’s all there ever is.

Release the need to know. Life entails uncertainty, no matter how strong your intention. Obsessing about tomorrow wastes your life because there will always be a tomorrow on the horizon. There are no guarantees about how it will play out. Just know it hinges on how well you live today.

Serve your purpose now. You don’t need to have x-amount of money in the bank to live a meaningful life right now. Figure out what matters to you, and fill pockets of time indulging it. Audition for community theater. Volunteer with animals. Whatever you love, do it. Don’t wait—do it now.

Teach others. It’s human nature to hope for things in the future. Even the most enlightened people fall into the habit from time to time. Remind yourself to stay open to possibilities by sharing the idea with other people. Blog about it. Talk about it. Tweet about it. Opening up helps keep you open.


**Letting Go of Attachment to Feelings**



Understand that pain is unavoidable. No matter how well you do everything on this list, or on your own short list for peace, you will lose things that matter and feel some level of pain. But it doesn’t have to be as bad as you think. As the saying goes, pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.

Vocalize your feelings. Feel them, acknowledge them, express them, and then let them naturally transform. Even if you want to dwell in anger, sadness or frustration—especially if you feel like dwelling—save yourself the pain and commit to working through them.

Write it down. Then toss it out. You won’t always have the opportunity to express your feelings to the people who inspired them. That doesn’t mean you need to swallow them. Write in a journal. Write a letter and burn it. Anything that helps you let go.

Xie Xie. It means thank you in Chinese. Fully embrace your happy moments—love with abandon; be so passionate it’s contagious. If a darker moment follows, remember: it will teach you something, and soon enough you’ll be in another happy moment to appreciate. Everything is cyclical.

Yield to peace. The ultimate desire is to feel happy and peaceful. Even if you think you want to stay angry, what you really want is to be at peace with what happened or will happen. It takes a conscious choice. Make it.

Zen your now. Experience, appreciate, enjoy, and let go to welcome another experience.

It won’t always be easy. Sometimes you’ll feel compelled to attach yourself physically and mentally to people and ideas—as if it gives you some sense of control or security. You may even strongly believe you’ll be happy if you struggle to hold onto what you have. That’s OK. It’s human nature.

Just know you have the power to choose from moment to moment how you experience things you enjoy: with a sense of ownership, anxiety, and fear, or with a sense of freedom, peace and love.

The most important question: what do you choose right now?

So this post is an oldie but goodie... I was reading through my notes the other day and I noticed I sometimes reference the Three Second Rule but I have never written a proper post about it. So without further ado...

**THE THREE SECOND RULE**

This was promoted back in the 1990s on the usenet group alt.seduction.fast. I am sure it has origins before that. It was popularized by Neil Strauss in his novel *The Game.*

**The rule is simple: When you see an attractive woman, you have exactly 3 seconds from the moment you notice her to begin your approach.**

While I don't agree with the Three Second Rule as a hard and steady rule with no exceptions, I do believe it is the single greatest method for getting over approach anxiety (short of getting completely blitzed on Jack Daniels and making a fool of yourself).

It is especially useful for people who are just starting out practicing game. **It works because it's so simple.**

---

**Committing to the rule:** When you're getting ready to head out, tell yourself that you will be following the Three Second Rule. Forget EVERYTHING else. It is the only thing you need to concern yourself.

For me, I would be standing in the corner of a bar with friends, chatting about whatever... I see a beautiful girl walk by the bar, stop RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATION, and approach. A typical opener can be:

* ""Wow, hi. How's it going? I'm TofuTofu, who are you?""

Keep it simple. Think about it from her point of view... The only impression she has of you at this point is that you're 1) confident enough to approach her immediately without wavering and 2) direct enough with your desires to act on them immediately. That's fucking awesome! **That's about as good as first impressions get!**

Some of the greatest girls I've ever met came from direct use of the Three Second Rule. I remember one in particular... Gorgeous, tall, blonde, fit, sexy, and she had just received her M.D. from Columbia. She absolutely adored me.

A few weeks into our fling we were cuddling in bed after sex and she said to me... *""The way you just... appeared out of nowhere the night we met... That was so hot, I knew I wanted to be with you.*

My mind was fucking blown. This shit works.

Try it out. If you apply the Three Second Rule, you'll never kick yourself for not approaching and you'll never have to suffer through more than *three seconds* of approach anxiety again. It's all about increasing your chances for success.

It's Saturday. Go meet some women.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1371309677.0,,,True,t3_1gehj1,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gehj1/the_greatest_trick_i_know_for_beating_approach/,
1352139394.0,514,self.seduction,12ofpw,Confidence for Beginners,626,112,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12ofpw/confidence_for_beginners/,"How to get confidence?  It is a question that commonly gets asked around here.  My usual answer has always been ""fake it until you make it.""  Which in my opinion is a fantastic answer, and it gets results.  But if someone had told me this back when I was a struggling beta with no confidence, it would have just blown right past me.  Without any traction for it to stick to, it is just a meaningless phrase.  So this is for all of the beginners with zero confidence.

**Fear/ Self Doubt**

When I was in college, I felt like a 15 year old boy amongst 25 year old men.  I felt like I didn't match up to them physically or experience wise.  I withdrew from socializing because I felt like people were judging me and it had to be clear to them that I didn't fit the typical college physique/personality/persona.  I was full of self doubt and didn't think that I could fit in.  You see how many times I said ""I"" in those last 2 sentences?  I was the one that was causing all of my self doubt.  I was the one that was causing me to withdraw and be anti-social.  I was the one that was determining my level of confidence.  

People weren't judging me.  I was judging myself through other people's eye's.  I was determining other people's opinions of me for them.  Are you doing the same thing?  Have you ever said to yourself ""she won't like me because I am too tall/short/skinny/fat/nerdy/introverted/ugly/boring/poor/un-athletic?  Have you avoided a social situation because you felt like you wouldn't fit in?  If so, you are the one that is defining what other people think of you.

Whenever somebody meets you, you are a blank slate.  They don't know your past, what you did in high school, where you went to college, how many girls you've slept with, what job you have, how much money you make, how big your dick is.  They can only see what you allow them to see.  You create what they see.  You have the power to create their perception of you.  They don't know anything about your personality and if you don't allow them to see it, they will never get a chance to.  If you pull yourself out of the game because of your self doubts, they will never get a chance to know you and you will never get a chance to show them.  

Stop allowing fear of what others may think of you control who you are.  You are the one that controls how people perceive you.  How you project yourself is how others will perceive you.

**Negative Thinking**

Harboring negative thoughts leads to a vicious cycle.  Negative thinking leads to negative actions.  Negative actions lead to self doubt and low self esteem.  This leads to more negative thinking and the cycle continues in a downward spiral.  Luckily, the exact opposite is also true.  Positive thinking leads to positive actions.  Positive actions lead to confidence and high self esteem.  There are 2 keys to creating this path:  

First-  Get to the root of the negative thoughts.  Where do these negative thoughts stem from?  Get out a piece of paper.  Write a list of everything that you feel is holding you back.  This may be physical, emotional, financial, or whatever.  Truly look within yourself and confront your fears.  Don't hold back.  Now this list in going to contain 2 different kind of things:  things you can change and things you can't.  

First, the things you can change.  Too fat/skinny/un-athletic?  Hit the gym.  Bad acne?  See a dermatologist.  Too poor?  Get a job.  Whatever it is, you hold the power to change it if you desire to.  Next are things you can't change.  If you are too short or tall or ugly or whatever- you can't change that.  You have to learn to accept this.  Look in the mirror.  What do you see?  That is what you are stuck with.  That is what you have to work with.  You don't get a reset button or a second chance.  Accept what you have.  Love what you have.  These attributes aren't holding you back- *it is your perception of these attributes* that is holding you back.  You influence the way people perceive these attributions.  If you think they are negative, other people will perceive them this way too.  If you embrace them, then other people will embrace them too.  Once again, you hold the power to create other people's perceptions of you.

Second:  Start thinking positive (which goes hand in hand with: stop thinking negative).  Not just about women, but everything in life.  This is going to take a conscious effort on your part.  You have to literally recognize every time a negative thought pops into your head and change it.  It is a simple as that.  Change your negative filter into a positive filter.  Give everything a positive spin.  The entire world opens up when you make the paradigm shift from negative to positive thinking.  Things you didn't think were possible all of a sudden become obtainable.  

**Putting it Together/ Self Actualization**

Maslow describes Self Actualization as ""the desire for self-fulfillment, namely the tendency for him [the individual] to become actualized in what he is potentially. This tendency might be phrased as the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.""

Notice that he describes the ""desire"" as the means of achieving what one is capable of, not some external factor.  So must you if you wish to achieve what you are capable of.  Only your desire and commitment will allow you to achieve your goals.  This is done through:

*Facing your fears and self doubts so they can be removed.  

*Removing your own preconceived notions of how people judge you.  

*Developing your own sense of being of who you are and projecting that to other people.  

*This is achieved by removing negative thinking from your life and replacing it with positive thinking.  

*At the same time, you must strive to be the best version of yourself by improving yourself and accepting the attributes about yourself that cannot be changed.   ",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_12ofpw,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12ofpw/confidence_for_beginners/,

It's literally too easy.  Just go up to a girl at the bar, be confident, and say ""I bet you look so much cuter when you smile.""  And I promise you, if you just be smooth about it, you will make her smile, girls LOVE this one.  And then you say, ""I knew it!""  I promise you, after that, you will have 100% of her attention.  

EDIT:  This one is also a good trick, for shy guys, to practice talking to girls.  If you go to a bar with a lot of good looking women, you can use it all night, many times -- waiting in line for drinks, passing girls in the bathroom line, outside smoking, etc.  It's an easy way to rack up a lot of small moments with women, and it also leaves you in a great position to talk further, if you like her.  

EDIT 2:  As always, lots of different perspectives on this ""move"".  Here's the thing:  yes, it's a rehearsed line, but, it's simple (so even if you're nervous, you won't forget the words), it's upbeat (women want to be made to feel happy), and it takes 5 seconds!  In 5 seconds, you've got a girl's attention, and she's INSTANTANEOUSLY happy.  Just like everything in life, there's no one type of girl, and yes, some girls don't like this, but, what's to hate?  You made her smile!  Any girl who doesn't smile at this, probably isn't in a mood to be picked up, if she ever is.  I'm telling you, as someone who was cripplingly shy for years, this has changed my life!  Maybe I'll find something better, but, keep this one in mind, trust me.

EDIT 3:  Good call by Gwohl in the comments below:  ""How about:
'I bet you look even cuter when you smile.'  You don't want to tell a girl she doesn't look good. This implies that she does.""  Hey, I'm new to this whole thing and trying to learn, myself!

You probably won't get to fuck a stripper, but you can still learn a lot in a short period of time.

**You don't have to worry about approaching.** They generally will approach you. The best way to get a girl to come to your table is simply to make eye contact with her and smile. She will make a beeline your way unless she's with another customer. **In the real world you still will need to learn to approach**, but by removing this initial source of anxiety you can focus on conversational tactics and not get stuck in your head thinking of an opener.

**By going to strip clubs, you will get used to the experience of having conversations with very attractive women.** Yes, these women are trying to game *you.* Don't resent that. It's their job. But they're still people and would much prefer to have interesting conversations with a guy who doesn't treat them like two-bit whores. Last night I went to a strip club and the three hottest girls there kept coming back to hang out with me even though I gave them no money. One of them has even done cool favors for me like get me free tickets to concerts (her sister works at a local venue). I haven't tried to sleep with any of them because they all have boyfriends (about which more below).

**You can practice being cocky/funny and not worry about failing.** It's her job to seduce *you*, so she will put up with your lame jokes, awkward silences and stupid magic tricks. However, her body language will tell you whether it's working or not. Again, you probably won't take her home with you, but you can still look for IOIs and, conversely, when she's turned off. Think of this as a chance to develop your calibration skills. 

**You can practice all the kino you want.** Strippers are masters of kino. Observe the way she touches you and don't be scared to touch her back. Don't do anything crude like grab her ass. Touch her arm, play with her hands, let your legs intertwine, touch her hair while complimenting it, pull her close when she's talking and you can't hear what she's saying (or even if you can). 

**You can develop good eye contact skills.** Sometimes I go sit by the stage and wait for a girl to come dance for me. Instead of staring at her tits or ass, I lock eye contact and hold it the whole time. It's actually really erotic. Some girls even blush. 

**Conversational Tips**

* Don't talk about sex right away, or even at all. Most of the guys she talks to there are either super boring or immediately go for the dirty talk. She will put up with that because it's her job, but she is turned off by it.

* Don't call her a ""stripper."" Call her a ""dancer."" She may still use that word, in which case it's probably okay for you to use it too. But some girls are ashamed of what they do and don't like to be reminded of it.

* Don't ask her about her job. Instead, practice deeper conversational topics like her passions, what her childhood was like (the stereotype about all strippers having shitty childhoods is BS), where she wants to travel to etc. 

* I've found that most strippers really do like to dance and often even have ballet training, so that's a good topic. One girl I know danced professional ballet in New York. Another is training to audition for Cirque du Soleil.

* At the start of a conversation, instead of asking ""how are you?"" ask ""how's your life?"" It breaks them out of their usual pattern and they give much more thoughtful answers which lead to more interesting conversations.

* Practice playful conversation. When girls ask me what I do I usually say I'm a CIA agent or an astronaut. When they ask me how old I am I say 74 (I'm in my mid forties).

* Practice talking about yourself in an interesting way. Talk about your passions and in particular *how they make you feel.* For example, I like to ski, but instead of just sharing that fact I talk about the feeling I get of being ""in the zone"" when I'm tearing up a run. I use that to transition to asking her if she has anything that makes her feel that way.

* Compliment her about something besides her looks. I try to find one of her passions. One stripper I know is a really talented painter. Another is a competitive ballroom dancer who competes in a different city every week. If nothing else, tell her she has a good energy about her.

* If the topic of sex comes up, be original. Don't tell her you want to fuck her. Instead ask her what's the craziest thing she's ever done, or tell her about an intense or funny sexual experience of your own. This past week I had a crazy three-way that ended on a really weird note. Last night at the strip club, instead of bragging or professing to be really good in bed, I talked in a cocky/funny way about how sometimes even an alpha male like me manages to fuck things up. The girls were eating it up.

* (As an aside, some of them really are total horndogs who like to share TMI. Roll with it.)

* Another playful way to talk about sex is to say you're terrible at it. I say something like ""I'm really bad in bed. I think it's because I have terrible spatial skills and always forget what goes where, who's supposed to be on top, where the TV remote is..."" You can even joke about how small your dick is.

* Many if not most of them will have boyfriends. Don't be afraid to ask them about their relationships. You'll be surprised by what they reveal. Never, ever put down her boyfriend in any way. She'll put her shields up immediately.

* Make it clear that you don't judge her for what she does. I usually say something like ""I love strippers. Not because they get naked, but because they have to earn every single dollar they take home. That's not true of most jobs.""

* (If you do judge strippers, do us all a favor and don't go to strip clubs. We don't need the negative energy there.)

**Other Tips**

* Go early. I usually go around 9 pm. There aren't many customers and a lot of girls are just sitting around bored. I also tend to go during the week when it's not as busy. Sometimes the ratio is 3 women for every guy.

* Another advantage of going early: hitting a strip club *before* going out to the bars is a good, no-risk way to get into state.

* Don't be a cheapskate. You don't have to throw crazy make-it-rain money at the stage, but tip well.

* If you want a lap dance, get one and don't complain about the price. I personally don't like lapdances, but sometimes I will just slip a girl a twenty and say ""I know you're working and I appreciate your spending time with me while on the clock. I'm not going to buy a lapdance from you, so if you want to work the room feel free."" 

* Tip the bartenders and waitresses well. I usually give one dollar per drink, even when they're giving me free refills (more about that below). 

* I usually go into a club assuming I will spend $100 in a couple of hours, though I often spend much less. I don't think of this as paying women for their time. I think of it as paying for entertainment.

* Make friends with the bouncers and wait staff. This is a very useful skill to develop for the real world.

* Don't spend much time by the main stage. I only go there for a few minutes at a time to tip a specific girl I like, often one I've already talked to previously.

* You won't be attracted to every girl who hits you up. Tell her right away (with a friendly smile) that you won't be buying a lap dance from her. Or if you're there with a friend, tell her you haven't seen him for a while and want to catch up. She'll appreciate your not wasting her time.

* Dress well. Even sex workers appreciate a man who has style.

* Stay away from the really drunk girls. They have issues. 

* I personally don't drink at strip clubs. I'm better able to observe the social dynamics when sober. Many clubs will give you free soft drinks if you tell them you're the designated driver.

If you feel a real connection with a girl, tell her you'd like to get coffee with her sometime and ask for her number. If you've done all of the above well, many of them will give it to you. If she does, stop thinking of her as a stripper and just treat like any other girl you would try to date.  

And if she doesn't, think of it as practice at dealing with rejection. I've been rejected hundreds of times in real life.

For you busy redditors, here's the tl;dr - the real article has much more detail and dick jokes, though.

1) Be more selfish.

2) Stop putting value on the opinions of strangers, and others who aren’t close/helpful to you.

3) Have a slightly unreasonable measure of confidence in yourself.

4) Be okay with being out of your comfort zone, and take other people out of their comfort zones just for a second to size them up.

5) Take a risk, and be okay with making mistakes.

6) Quit taking everything so seriously and have more fun.

**The grain of salt**: It is possible to take on all of these positive asshole qualities without being a dickheaded sociopath who steps all over everyone so that he can have a little fun. Just remember you can’t please everyone all the time and you shouldn’t try to.

We were having a good time chatting and I was playfully teasing her until something I said (clearly in jest) made her angry and she said, ""Screw you, I'm leaving."" She grabbed her coat and walked out the door. Any AFC at this point would've chased her outside and apologized profusely, but I knew that she was overreacting so I stayed put and enjoyed my beer for a few minutes until she inevitably returned, flabbergasted that I hadn't gone after her.

""What would you have done if I really left?"" she asked. I shrugged and said, ""I probably would've joined in a game of pool with someone else.""

We resumed having fun for a while and later we took a cab back to my place. On the walk to my door she started acting up again, trying to get a reaction out of me, but I kept my playful frame and teased her again as if she were my snotty little sister. She turned around and started walking away, so I just went inside to my apartment, got comfortable and checked my email. Ten minutes later I get a phone call from her. ""I'm lost,"" she said, on the verge of tears. ""Come get me."" I said No, you know where I live, and told her my address. I gave her shit for wandering off -- ""Pretty cold out there, isn't it?"" -- and eventually she found my place and came upstairs to my room.

At that point I threw her on my bed and chastised her for misbehaving while I undressed her. We had amazing, rough sex and she stayed at my place until late the next day.

I can say with confidence that this girl is now mine. I recognized all of her uppitiness for what it was: a shit test. Nothing I said was mean-spirited or over the line; she was just throwing this stuff at me to see if I was weak or if she could push me around. Not happening.

1345531518.0,496,self.seduction,ykilt,The Strong Introvert,617,121,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ykilt/the_strong_introvert/,"I’ve had some ideas floating around in my head for a while that I’d like to share, namely about owning up to and being comfortable in your own personality whatever it may be. In my case, and I’m sure in the case of many other redditors, I am more introverted. (For those who aren’t familiar with Introversion/Extraversion, [here](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/extraversion-or-introversion.asp) is pretty good explanation)    


  

With terms like “alpha” and “life of the party” being thrown around, some might be inclined to believe that this means they have to adopt a completely different persona to be attractive. This is not the case at all, and I’ve had tremendous success being my natural, introverted self while still being extremely confident.    

  


**Body Language**     
This has absolutely been the most important key in my experience. Body language is such an incredibly powerful form of communication and most people aren’t consciously aware of it. You don’t have to say a damn word to communicate your interest in a girl, just show it. Eye contact is especially important. Make a habit out of holding the shit out of eye contact with someone. Accompany it with a playful, slight smirk.  Take up space. Be comfortable. Keep your head up and don’t look at the ground. Let girls catch you checking them out and don’t be apologetic or embarrassed about it.    


  

**Listening and Being Attentive**    
Being an introvert, I’ve always felt more natural in one-on-one conversations or in small groups. In situations that are more intimate, listen intently to everything that is being said. I always try to get the other person to do most of the talking, while still being genuinely interested. Give them your full attention and don’t try to think about what to say next. Lose yourself in her eyes while she’s talking; fall between the spaces between her words. People talk because they want to be heard.    


  

**Being Concise**     
(ironic because this is turning into a novel) Less is more. If you have something to say, you’re going to say it assertively in a deep, clear voice. If you don’t have anything to say, you don’t say anything because you don’t feel the need to pull something out of your ass. Get rid of filler words like “um” and “uh”, don’t stutter, and get right to the point. Let other guys try to shout over each other to get a girl’s attention while you sit back and give a flirty look in her direction. You are completely comfortable with not always talking, but this isn’t an excuse not to say anything. Remember, when you have something to say, you’ll say it.    


  

**Quiet Confidence**    
If you’re naturally more laid-back and contemplative, own up to that and be comfortable with it. If you try to put on a show and be the center of attention, girls will sense that you aren’t secure with simply being yourself. In my experience, that combination of quiet confidence and not feeling the need to prove your worth to anyone around you drives girls crazy – they’ll really start qualifying themselves to you. They’ll start becoming more and more interested in your mystique and wonder why you aren’t trying to win their attention. They’re going to be curious about you because you don’t talk much about yourself or brag. Embrace your introversion; being able to enjoy your own company and be confident while being alone shows a strong independence that is very attractive.

- this whole game **isn't about just you**. you are giving people your value in the same way that you give people presents for their birthday. it feels good to give something and not receive something back immediately. weights off your mind. 
- what women (and men) look for is confidence. and not the external confidence of manly manliness that can take a truck to the pecs to shield a town of maidens (although that is a plus for many women). no, it's the self-confidence of knowing who you are and what makes you happy. you can be shy and be confident, and you can be a social butterfly and be confident.
- you can't please the whole world. sometimes your face or the shoes you are wearing might piss someone off for no reason at all. oh well, whatevs. they're probably having a terrible day. hopefully tomorrow will be kinder to them!
- everyone wants to be loooovvveedddd. smile at strangers as you walk by them. raise your eyebrows a little for added effect haha. if you smile at a less-than-perfect-looking girl it might make her day, and she probably won't stalk you. when you see little siblings wrestling on the ground and laughing, or when you see an old man and his wife chortle to themselves **it makes your heart squeeze with tenderness**. make everyone's heart squeeze and laugh in public with friends.
- you aren't better than anybody. we are all just as ""good"" as each other, because we are products of our environments. if you were brought up in a home with abusive parents and your childhood friends were killed in front of you, **you'd be fucked up, too. Stop acting so pretentious ya fools**. but if we didn't as a society disapprove of being a dick, or spoiled, or arrogant, then the problems would never be solved. **THEREFORE, BE A GOOD PERSON.** make people around you be happy that they know you, and make the world a better place.
- laugh a lot. find the bright side to life! it's usually the little things. I like the smell of rain, and I like seeing a leaf all crumpled up on the ground.
- be honest with yourself. often, you will dislike people for personality traits that you can find in yourself. there's a part of us that will always hate part of us, and that is the part of us that keeps us **self-improving**. recognize your flaws and work on fixing them.
- when you smile, smile with your whole body :) and smile often!",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_qt6rq,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/qt6rq/im_nobody_special_but_heres_what_ive_learned_in/,

First, a little about me: 34y/o male, 6ft, 210lbs, athletic build (I work out regularly), heterosexual, never been married, currently single and dating regularly. My resume includes somewhere's in the ballpark of 1000+ contacts and number closes, K-Closes, and F-closes, 500 plus first dates, (roughly) 150 sexual partners, five orgies, two threesomes, and one MFFF experience. I've dated nearly every nationality you can imagine; Caucasian, Afro-American, Hispanic, Asian (including Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Cambodian, and Filipino), French, Russian, Indian, and Native American. I've dated women 20yrs my senior (when is was in my late teens), and personally, never women more then five years my junior. I've dated women with Masters Degrees, and HS dropouts. I've dated bi-sexual women, athletic women, emo girls, pot heads, gamer chics, jocks, prom queens and debutantes, ride or die chicks, strippers, porn starlets, and almost everything in between. I've dated models and some of the most beautiful women imaginable, and I've dated women who where just shy of ""Fugly as hell!"", but had a great personality that made up for it. I've dated short girls (we're talking an inch shy of legally being a midget), and women who where six feet tall bare foot; women who were almost tragically thin, and women I couldn't lift if my life depended on it, and I can bench 305lbs max! 

Long story short: I've been around.

All that said, and after reading many of the questions and advice offered here on r/Seduction, I'd like to believe that some of my experience can help clear some things up for those of you still struggling with figuring out how to meet men/and women, how to interact with them, and how to get dates, bed partners, long term relationships, etc.

First and foremost; the majority of post on r/seduction and r/dating advice seem to be about ""How do I talk to this person about how I feel?"" What do I say? Where do I go to meet people? How do I avoid looking like a complete idiot and making a fool of myself? What's a ""golden opener""? How do I transition from a date to my place? How do I avoid getting ""friendzoned""? It seems many of the subscribers to r/seduction and r/dating advice are looking for a play by play manual of  meeting someone, talking to them, going out, getting physical, and having a relationship.  Well, seek no further, because I'm about to give you the answer, based solely on my experience:

THERE IS NO MAGIC ANSWER!!

See, what many of you need to understand is that seduction techniques, PUA material, and so-called ""Game Manuals"", don't teach you how to pick up chicks/dudes; they teach you how to control yourself, how to increase your level of personal confidence, and how to become more outgoing and social.  They teach you how to market yourself better to increase your odds of coming across more genuine, more sincere, and more appealing.  But even then, when it comes to meeting someone, many times, the outcome has little to do with what you say and/or do, and more about the circumstances and situation.

If someone isn't in the right ""head space"" to meet someone, even if they find you attractive, its not going to happen. If they're already involved, just got their heart stomped on, have a ton of personal baggage they need to work out, or otherwise, just have some stuff going on, they may not be receptive to your advances. 

Conversely, if someone is into you, you can say pretty much anything, and they'll still give you a shot.  Believe me when I tell you, I've met and hooked up with women after saying some of the most outlandish shit you can imagine. I once met a girl at a shoe store while she was trying on heels. The first words I ever spoke to her: ""No... those shoes only work if we're fucking!"" Three nights later, we were! Likewise, I've been the picture of ""James Bond"" smooth, sending a woman a drink before going over and introducing myself, been the perfect gentleman, charming, funny, articulate, and sensual. And crashed and burned!

If someone is into you, if they are receptive to meeting someone, if they find you attractive, and if they are in the right frame of mind to engage you, if they are available (and sometimes even when they're not), then it'll happen. Otherwise, it won't. Period. There is no magic formula, no golden line, no super smooth approach, no mathematical calculation, no subtle gesturing, no jedi mind trick, there's nothing you can do to make a woman who's not interested in you suddenly weak in the knees, head over heels, wet in the panties into you.

But there are things that you can say and do, a way you can carry yourself, that will increase the attraction that's already there.  And that's what r/seduction is all about; learning what you can do to increase attraction.  Learning how to walk, talk, move, and even smile to make those little receptors in a persons brain go ""Well what do we have here?""

If I approach a woman, and she's not interested, it's not because I have weak game or don't know how to talk to women. It's because she wasn't interested! Likewise, there are times when I haven't said two words directly to a woman, and she's stuffing her number in my pocket. And again, it's not because of any super game or magic way I wiggle my hips when I walk. It's the overall presentation.

Now, I could speak at length about the subtle psychology behind most rules of attraction and what have you; things you can say or do to make a fire burn a little hotter for you, or ways to peak someones interest once you already have it, but this post is already long enough. However, I'd be remiss if I didn't offer a few of the basics:

We don't need any drama coming back here.*

Somebody in AskReddit asked women if they use similar tactics to the ""yawn, then put arm over her shoulder""-tactic that guys tend to use. Here are some of their moves:

1. Laugh, then touch the guy (like saying ""Haha you're so funny,"" then she touches your thigh/arm). Many girls will repeat this move multiple times during an interaction, increasing the duration of the touch -- just like what we talk about on seddit.

2. Yawn and lean on the guy (like when she's ""tired,"" she'll lean her head on your shoulder/chest).

3. Sit on the guy's lap. 

4. Brush her hand against the guy's hand -- briefly -- when she wants him to hold her hand.

5. Brush against the guy while walking past him, especially when there's already enough room to get around him (she'll brush her boobs/ass/arm against you).

6. Sit ""uncomfortably close"" to the guy (often, your feet/thighs will be literally touching -- if she makes no effort to move, she might be into you). 

7. Tell him there's a piece of lint/whatever on some part of his body (this just gives her an excuse to touch you in some way).

8. Tell him she's ticklish (we, as guys, will often treat this as an invitation to tickle her -- which is exactly what she wanted). Same thing applies with ""play wrestling/fighting."" 

9. Bite her lip/bat her eyelashes while looking at the guy.

10. Gently scratch the back of his neck.

11. Wipe food/whatever off of his face.

12. Bounce her boobs when she knows he's watching. Same thing applies to the ass.

13. Give him ""accidental"" butterfly kisses while whispering to him (also applies when talking at a loud bar/party/club). 

14. Move into closer-than-normal proximity, just in general (exactly what we talk about on seddit).

15. Run fingers through his hair, for any reason.

16. Offer to give him a massage.

17.  Ask to borrow his jacket/hoodie/anything warm.

18. Stretch in a way that shows off her boobs.

Alright, that's pretty much all I got from the thread. I found it pretty funny that so many girls admit to purposely using kino and other ""tactics"" (I'm surprised *nobody* seemed to mention seddit at any point). 

These moves are all IOIs. Sometimes they're incidental, but other times they're completely purposeful. If a girl seems to be generally touchy-feely around everyone, some of these ""moves"" may just be natural for her, but you might as well assume interest anyway and take advantage of the situation.

1338758445.0,494,self.seduction,uj32a,Best ways to socialize at a party.,593,99,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/uj32a/best_ways_to_socialize_at_a_party/,"It’s not easy to work a crowd. There are a few strategies I’ve learned that have made it possible for me to make friends with everyone I meet. Let’s start with the basics:


**1) Get to a party/event on time.** This is the most crucial tip. Everyone thinks that it’s cool to show up fashionably late to an event, when in reality it does more harm than good. The key is to show up right on time. Being there before everyone else gives you a chance to meet and greet the host without distraction, check out the surroundings and say hi to people as they come in. Greeting the new arrivals is easy because they’re the only ones to talk to! Bam…you are instantly making friends. Showing up late to a party is a disadvantage because guests have already started to mingle.


**2) Introduce everyone.** No, you’re not the host, so technically it’s not your job, but when you start introducing strangers it gives you a leg up. You can introduce all of the random people you’ve been talking to and you will appear to be the most popular person in the room. This is easy since you’ve already greeted people as they have been walking in. Know what’s even better? Your new friends will introduce you to their friends, and so on and so forth, which gives you social proof.


**3) Inside jokes seal the bond.** Creating inside jokes with people you just meet will form an extremely solid bond, even with a stranger. When fun things are happening at the party or you make a funny joke, be clever and bring it up later in the night. This makes people feel that you’re creating a bond, which brings your connection to a deeper level. This one can get tricky though, so just be careful not to overdo it.


**4) Take it easy on the alcohol.** I am a big advocate of not going overboard on the drinking. This includes bars, clubs, networking events and more. Alcohol is a great social lubricant, don’t get me wrong, but the more you drink the less you’ll be able to have meaningful conversations. Getting to know a person on a deeper level is key to making new friends and attracting women. Alcohol may make the approach easier but it won’t help with the rest of your meet and greet. Instead, it will make you sloppy and disoriented. Plus, it’s in your benefit to master social skills, because you may end up at a party one day where they don’t serve alcohol.


**5) Get Facebooks, emails and phone numbers.** No, not all three from one person, but get contact information from the men and women you meet.

• Facebook Info – this will help if you want to start your own party and invite people, plus it’s always an easier and more casual way of getting in contact with people

• Emails – similar to getting someones Facebook info, this is a more casual way of getting in touch. Remember, if you want to get a woman on a date, you need to eventually get their phone number.

• Phone number – if you make a strong connection with somebody go right for the phone number. You’ll feel it when the time is right. If you’re sharing a lot of jokes and have been hanging out the entire night, then get their digits and hit them up for a date or hangout.

The next time you get invited to a networking event or party use these tips and you will see success.

**TL;DR** - Be on time to a party.

**EDIT:** - There have been some discussions on #1. I believe that if you know most of the group attending, then it's okay to be late. It shouldn't really matter, because you know everyone. But this post is designated for parties where you aren't too familiar with the host, or maybe were invited by a friend of a friend etc. It's in your benefit to meet everyone and socialize if you're not familiar with the scene. You need to get in there. There's also been talk about high value vs. low value people at the party. Yes, it definitely helps to get in with the high value people, but it's good that people see you being social with everyone. You want to try and be the most well liked and social person in the room. You don't want to leave somebody out because they are ""low value"". That might bite you in the ass later on. Thanks for all the upvotes guys.

Rather than leave it there to rot I thought I'd put it here where it might be of some use to someone.

____________________________________________

I'm gona take a stab at some general guidelines here dude, but you pretty much hit the nail on the head yourself- you think too much.  Gruder got it right, it's not hard, but it just takes experience to know what to look for.  You said you don't know how forward you should be- this is a completely subjective problem. Every girl you talk to will have a different definition of flirting, and the only way you're going to find out what that is, is by trying your luck. As you get more experienced, your calibration and adaptability will improve which will enable you to spot patterns and think on your feet. For now, all you need to do is stop thinking and just get out there and do it.  Here's a few tips, but remember they'll work better if you keep your frame fun and lightly sexual (which is pretty much the definition of flirting anyway!)

- Initiate contact whenever possible.  When you make a girl laugh, reinforce it with a gentle touch on the arm, shoulder or back. This works on a lot of levels, the most basic being that she will associate your touch with fun / laughter / feeling good. If you aren't close enough for the touch, make sure you are next time. Also, get them to touch you. I have a shaved head, and asking girls to rub it for whatever ridiculous reason (good luck, to see into the future... The more ridiculous the better) is a great way to get a laugh and initiate some contact.  Find something that works for you and run with it.

- Get her thinking sexy.  Flirting becomes a lot easier when the girl is on a similar wavelength as you- ie a sexual one.  A great way to instigate this is Neil Strauss' Fantasy Elicitation routine from Rules Of The Game.  The (very!) basics-- you swing the conversation something like- ""Don't believe everything you read- did you know there was a professor in the sixties who wrote a book about how women were incapable of sexual fantasies?! I know right?! Then this woman called Nancy Friday wrote a response called My Secret Garden- she interviewed hundreds of women about their fantasies and put them all in a book! A girl I dated read it, she told me her fantasy was...... and no, we never did end up doing that!"" With any luck the girl should then start describing some fantasy of hers, after which you can talk about something completely different and let her marinade in her own sexy thoughts.

- Pet names. Can also be combined with contact for added flirtatiousness. I use it liberally when asking for things, but always keeping it jokey and fun- put your arm around their shoulders or waist while saying something like ""Darling, sugar-pie, honeybun... Fancy buying my another drink? / passing me my coat? / taking me home?""  If you've kept an appropriate frame, you'll find that they'll usually reciprocate the name calling and the contact.

EDIT! If you feel this is too creepy / sleazy / not going to work (or even if you don't!) try calling her something based on where she's from / what her job is / what her hobbies are.  Credit to Beemeroo82- ""Something more teasy and less grimy- For instance, I met a girl in Manhattan who said she wasn't from around here and we joked about it. I called her ""upstate"" and she loved it.""  And Toby16custom- ""I called this gal I was flirting with once Little Hollywood since she was going to school for acting and she ate it up."" Sparklyteenvampire added, ""If she reciprocates by making a nickname for you, you're golden--so make sure she has something to work with. If you call her ""City"", make sure she knows you're from the country. My favorite was a girl from the south I called ""Sunshine""; she knew I'm from the north, so I became ""Snowflake"".""

- Favours. Not strictly flirting, but psychological studies show that people will find you more attractive / like you more if they can convince themselves to do things for you.  Fact.  Use the Yes Ladder to help you out  (look it up if you aren't familiar with it.)

EDIT 3- TIL this is called the Ben Franklin Effect - http://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2011/11/16/do-me-a-favor-so-youll-like-me-the-reverse-psychology-of-likeability/

- Agree and amplify.  A great technique which can be used all day every day, especially when a girl is joking / flirting back / shit testing you.  A good example I once heard was at a house party, the host jokingly told his target, ""now if you'll excuse me, I do have other guests to be attending to..."" to which she replied ""ugh! You're such a terrible host!"" He came back with ""You have no idea! I threw a pool party last week... There were drowned naked people everywhere...""  Again, the more ridiculous / lightly sexual the better, as long as you stay confident and keep smiling.

Give those a try dude, they're pretty basic but it's a good start. Keep in mind that any kind of flirting, no matter how good it is, isn't going to work on a girl who has already decided to friend-zone you. It's always going to work better on a girl you've just met- initiate your frame early!  Good luck, and let us know how you get on.

**Qualifying women**

*""I wonder what she's like.""* &lt;-- This is your new mindset. Embrace it. Fall in love with it. It is your new best friend.

Plenty has been said about the importance of having an *abundance mentality* as opposed to a scarcity mindset. Women want men who have options. Employers are more likely to hire employees who have other job options. The best negotiators make sure they have viable, alternate options.

But how does one develop an abundance mentality towards women when they've never even kissed one? That, my friends, is the million dollar question. Plenty of great men have waxed poetically about this paradox, and most have utterly failed. Until now. **The answer lies in these five simple words: ""I wonder what she's like.""**

As you go through the self-improvement process, you will inevitably reflect upon what you want out of a partner. You will start to grasp what you really want out of life. As you evolve, so will your desires, values, and needs. This is a natural part of becoming a man.

With that in mind, going through life seeking out people, places, and things that fit your desires is only natural. No longer are you thinking, *""Will this girl like me?""* Instead you are thinking, *""I wonder what she's like.""*

**To put it another way, in each interaction, you are looking to expose the underlying truth.** It seems so simple, but *""What do you do for a living?""* takes on a whole new meaning when you follow it up with *""Why did you get into that field?"" and genuinely care how she answers.* 

Other Helpful Phrases:

* *""I'm curious about that. Tell me more.""*

* *""What are you passionate about?""*

* *""Why this school? Why not somewhere else?""*

* *""What made you choose this city for your vacation?""*

Learn to seek out the truth. What makes her tick? What is she really passionate about? Is she worthy of your time? Is she girlfriend material or is she someone you will want to invite out to help you cut the line at nightclubs? Figure that shit out. **This is how you develop an abundance mentality when you don't have abundance yet.** This is how you attract women.

**The guys who inquisitively seek out the truth like this are the guys who cause girls to say ""I met this guy last night who just... gets me. It was amazing.""** Be one of those guys.

---

**Calibration**

Calibration ties right in with this. You MUST understand how different people, places and situations affect how you can behave. Sometimes a girl just wants to be dry-humped on a dance floor. Other times she wants to spend an hour talking about family, life, and passions. Other times she wants to discuss current events.

**There is only one constant: It is YOUR job, as the man, to lead the interaction in a way that she finds pleasurable and sexy. This is your mission.**

I am not going to tell you how calibration works in every situation. That is something you MUST learn for yourself. Without reference experiences, you cannot master calibration. That means PRACTICE (Apologies to [Allen Iverson.](http://youtu.be/eGDBR2L5kzI))

The trick here is getting out of your comfort zone. Push your limits, be high energy, be low energy, say something crazy, mess up a girl's hair out of nowhere, pick her up in the air and spin her around, talk to her about sports, ask her about her family, ask her interview questions about her job and where she went to school. Get a drink thrown in your face. Try everything! Over time you will intuitively grasp how to act in different situations and what you can and can't get away with.

But throughout it all, **develop a love for finding out who she is and seeing if she's a fit for you.** That's the name of the game. That's what qualification is all about.

---

**Action Items**

1) Bust out your notebook. Write down a list of women (real, fictional, famous, friends, crushes, whoever) that you find attractive for some reason. Try to jot down at least 10-20. Leave space between each name.

2) Next to each name, write down specific things you find attractive about them. Let your stream of consciousness flow.

Examples: *her hair, sense of humor, loves to party, can drink as much as I can, plays guitar, likes Pink Floyd, plays sports, nice breasts, big ass, adorable, Latina, travels, has hot friends, religious, atheist, bisexual, polyamorous*

3) Look at the whole mess of text you just wrote. Just soak it in. Stare it for a few minutes with some music on in the background. Just soak it in while you visualize these various women and what they do for you.

4) Repeat the Action Items 5-8 in Part 3, but this time make an effort to seek the truth out in your interactions as laid out above. Journal these encounters and reflect on them.

5) Go to a high-energy nightclub or bar on a weekend **with the sole intention of getting rejected in the most hilarious fashion possible.** (This mindset is important. Bring friends if possible.) Think of crazy things to ask and do to women, then do it. Then do it to 10 more girls.

Examples: *Rub a girl's head and mess up her hair a little.* *Ask a group of girls their thoughts on The Human Centipede series.*

Push your comfort zone. Laugh at the hilarity of the rejections, you've earned it.

6) The next morning, think back on some of your crazy interactions and I guarantee you will realize girls let you get away with a lot more than you thought.

",591,107,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/uaxwp/fr_first_date_fclose_x2_lost_my_virginity_thanks/,"Two days ago I was a 21 years old virgin, unemployed, living with my parents. Today? I still am all of those except for one. That's the framework I want you to start from, just to realize how NONE of that matters.

So a week ago, I met this cute 24-year old girl in a club. [Field Report Here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/u0q41/fr_good_things_will_happen_if_you_never_doubt/) We had a real strong connection. Dancing turned into makeouts for the whole night. It went really well. I got her number and we talked. It turns out she is really cool and we had a lot of stuff in common. Last night we had a date.

We grabbed some frozen yogurt, and just talked, got to know each other. It was going well. We were walking around a bit and started to makeout. It started out mild, then just grew more passionate. Feeling eachother, kissing her neck, I suggested we move it some place more private. In my head, I thought the back seat of my car. She tells me that she has a house all to herself. Well gee. I'd be a fool to turn that down right?

So I follow her to her place. On the way we got blocked behind some train tracks as a train stalled, and stopped right in front of us. This would be so typical of a situation where I could possibly lose my virginity. A completely predictable act of God if you will. But we found a way around the train tracks. On the way to her place, she informed me that I was not getting in her pants on the first date. I laughed. I heard that shit test on here. I didn't respond to it but honestly, being inexperienced, I honestly wasn't anticipating that happening anyways. 

We get to her place, she offers me some water, we start making out in the kitchen. It moves to the bedroom. It just keeps escalating, we start taking off clothes and really feeling eachother up. She just tells me ""I don't usually do this, ever. (Meet a dude in a club, go on a date, take him back to her place, then sleep with him on the first date) There's just something about you""  She just asks me if I want to do it but warns me that she doesn't have any protection. I reached in my pocket pulled out a condom. I may have been a virgin but ALWAYS be prepared gentlemen. 

And so it went. People always told me my first time would suck, end too soon, not live up to my expectations. 

On the contrary. If anything, it went on forever, it was glorious, and adequately met expectations. And my God either I'm a natural or she's just incredible at faking, but the sounds out of this girls mouth were exquisite. Couple that with a shaky headboard the kept slamming into the back wall. Good Lord. 

After we finished the first time, I told her ""Want to know a crazy secret?"" ""First time"" she almost didn't believe me. Had to clarify with me like 3 times and said ""Aww you should've told me earlier"" We cuddled for a bit, then maybe 20 minutes later ""....Wanna go again?"" 

Twice. I ended up spending the night there sleeping with her. We woke up a few hours later. She said ""Well there's one thing left to do"" I was out of condoms, again? No not again. ""I'm gonna take a shower. Want to join?"" 

So we took a shower. Then we had to part ways. Nothing weird, nothing awkward. This was freaking lovely. I'm honestly having a hard time believing this even happened as I type this out but every word of it is true. 

I attribute a lot of my success to this place. I can't speak for how much of it really applied technically speaking. A lot of it has just been improving my mindset, being more confident, etc. All of that has been a byproduct of discovering this place though. I can definitely guarantee it applied to getting me to leave the damn house. Go out, do things, have fun. If I wasn't encouraged to go out more, have a more interesting life, and just learn to seize a moment when it's there, this would have never in a million years have even started, let alone escalate to what it did. 

So thank you all of you. I'm eternally grateful for all the help you've provided and all the improvement I've seen in myself. Life is good.

In the past  I acted coy, played games, and used techniques...this stuff is all ok, but ultimately, it is a crutch for newbies to feel like they can finally talk to women.  The biggest problem with all this is that if you are doing it, you are putting her on a pedestal and *giving her more value and importance* than you give yourself.  Its not lines and techniques that get the woman, its the man himself.

Game is all about honesty and vulnerability. This doesn't mean that you need to be honest about everything you say, but it does mean that you are saying and doing things for the right reasons.  For example, if I'm at a bar chatting with a girl and I notice that she looks great, I say ""you look great"" because it is a fact, not because I think it will help me get laid.  The same goes for escalating; if we're at her place making out on the couch and I want to eat her pussy, I tell her ""I want to eat your pussy.""

If you become more honest and shameless you will start getting into some pretty fun situations.  The last step of this is to accept full responsibility for everything that happens.  No girl wants to feel like a slut or like she was used, so you need to own everything you do and say.  Afterwards you will start hearing things like ""you're bad.""  My typical response is ""Yeah I am.  You turn me on like crazy.""  It makes her feel sexy and you're being completely honest.

Have any of you dudes experienced this?  If so, I would love to hear about your journey in this territory of game.

They are ways that my thoughts have changed over the past few years.

Would love to hear your suggestions, or epiphanies that you've had.

&gt; ~~""I need to get a cute girl so I can be happy""~~

&gt; **""I need to be happier, then I can share this happiness with cute girls""**

So important. If you haven't grasped this concept - this is all you need to learn. A girl can't make you happy. A girl can multiply your happiness, but she can also multiply your insecurity. Get your shit together, learn to be happy with yourself, then start thinking about how you can bring girls into your awesome new world.

**Edit**: [puzzlecracker suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wnbu6/a_summary_of_mindset_changes/c5evu18) that ""I need to"" would be better replaced with ""I choose to""

&gt; ~~""Girls want rich, successful, attractive guys.""~~

&gt; **""Girls want guys who are happy with who they are. Often those guys go on to be more successful, and tend to care more about their style.""**

This is a bit controversial, but I think that success and attractiveness go hand in hand with attitude on life. Plus, anybody can hugely improve their attractiveness just by dressing well, working out and getting a hair cut. Not instantly - your style is something you'll have to work on over time. But the simple fact that you're taking action to continuously improve yourself is attractive in itself.

&gt; ~~""So, what if I get rejected?""~~

&gt; **""So what if I get rejected.""**

Granted, it's difficult to simply 'not care' about getting rejected. But really, seriously, think about the worst that could happen. A slap from a girl you'll never see again? That would be a fun story to tell. A bunch of people laugh at you? Unlikely, others are jealous of your huge balls of steel and lamenting that they couldn't do the same. Now think about the best that could happen.

&gt; ~~""How can I possibly talk to that cute girl?""~~

&gt; **""How can I possibly pass up this opportunity to talk to that cute girl?""**

This is one I still struggle with. Having this mindset can be painful, because every time you pussy out it feels like a part of you died. ""How can I possibly talk to that cute girl?"" however is just an excuse that your mind creates to rationalise not taking action.

&gt; ~~""I hope she doesn't think I'm hitting on her""~~

&gt; **""I hope she knows I'm attracted to her""**

Guys, I have lost SO MANY opportunities because I didn't know the girl was into me, and she didn't show it because she didn't know I was into her! Kino!

&gt; ~~""Oh shit, a question, is this a test? Shit, how do I answer… Just be polite...""~~

&gt; **""I like your boots! Where'd you get them?""**

You don't need to reply to every question. A conversation doesn't have to be question, answer, question, answer. If you think of something cool, bring it up. Outside of deep, meaningful conversations most people just ask questions to fill conversation anyway, they don't really care about your answer.

&gt; ~~""Does she like me?""~~

&gt; **""Do I like her?""**

WHO CARES if she likes you. Don't decide for her. You need to think about whether you like her. Every time you find yourself asking ""Does she like me?"", think to yourself ""If I knew without a doubt that she was totally into me, what would I do?"". Then do that. Assume Attraction.

&gt; ~~""I need to read /r/seduction more so that I can be prepared for every awkward situation""~~

&gt; **""I need to get myself into more awkward situations so that I can understand what those guys at /r/seduction are talking about""**

Reading is knowledge, and knowledge is power. Except in this case - where knowledge makes you think too much. Instead of enjoying the moment - the pure interaction between two humans - you're in your head wondering whether you're doing everything right. Throw all that stuff out. A lot of it applies only to the person giving the advice, resulting in conflicting advice causing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance. Once you've got a benchmark to apply, you can choose the advice that you think suits your style. That said, everything on this page is the absolute truth &gt;:)

&gt; ~~""I need to work out how to avoid rejection""~~

&gt; **""I need to put myself in more situations where I could get rejected""**

If you're constantly worried about getting rejected, you'll avoid the boundaries. Push the boundaries. Don't ever force a girl to do anything she doesn't want to, but let her decide by making yourself the one vulnerable to rejection. The only way you can learn how to get rejected less is by getting rejected! Work out what works and what doesn't - its different for everyone.

**EDIT:** Jeebus! Wasn't expecting front page! Glad you guys found it useful. Here are some bonus extras:

&gt; ~~""What do I say next?""~~

&gt; **""""**

Yes, that was intentionally left blank. When you're truly in the moment, funny, witty stuff just pops into your mouth and you say it before even thinking it. Getting to be 'in the moment' is hard; you have to be completely comfortable in your environment and with yourself. I struggle to get into it, but when you get there it feels oh so great, especially for an ex-SAP like myself. I've found meditation/relaxation can help sometimes. Other than that, you just have to put yourself into uncomfortable situations until they become comfortable.

&gt; ~~""What do I do to make this girl attracted to me?""~~

&gt; **""What can I improve to make myself more attractive?""**

Focussing on trying to get one girl, while it may seem at first noble/loyal, often works against you. When you worry so much about whether this one girl will like you, it makes the whole situation more stressful. Work on yourself, and the rest will happen naturally. You can be noble and loyal when you've got the girl if you want.

&gt; ~~""If I can just [be good with girls/get this job/own this car/have sex/move to europe] I'll be happy.""~~

&gt; **""If I can just improve this [small thing], I can focus on improving another thing.""**

One thing I've learned is that no matter where you are in life, or what you have - there is always another step. ""Getting things"" only results in temporary happiness. Small incremental changes that change for the better who you are as a person gives you progress to look back on. If you're happy with what you have and you're always improving, you only have even better things to look forward to. For the mathematically inclined - benchmark yourself on f'(t) instead of f(t), where f(t) is your life.

&gt; ~~""I just got rejected. How shameful, I hope nobody was watching.""~~

&gt; **""I just got rejected. That means I pushed my boundaries, and learned something. *Self-high-five*""**

Maybe people were watching. Maybe they were even your friends. Maybe they are going to tease you about it. Maybe they will make your life hell. Maybe they won't be friends with you anymore because you took a fucking chance and did what you wanted to do, instead of conforming to 'normal'. Maybe you should get new friends.

Thanks pals; can't ask without giving, here's my contribution.



**ALOOFNESS**


Aloofness is *not* playing hard-to-get. 

Displaying aloofness to a girl is going to turn her on more than pretty much anything. Makes sense because it's way harder to display aloofness than it is to display confidence, status, non-neediness, you get the picture.

Merriam-Webster defines aloof as: ""removed or distant either physically or emotionally""

In terms of seduction, this definition turns into: Pretending to not notice and choosing to not react to signs of obvious interest coming from a girl

But this idea of aloofness *will not* result in anything but a pissed-off and confused girl who either thinks you're an asshole, uninterested,  socially inept, or a combination of them all. 

So, we need to add one caveat to the context of aloofness in seduction so that it actually makes sense: Pretending to not notice and choosing to not react to signs of obvious interest coming from a girl, by *saying* something that appears to be ignorant, while otherwise acting in the exact opposite way



                              BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN???



This means that when a girl says something indirectly flirtatious, you say something that *appears* to brush her off or be ignorant of her come-on, but your response, in either your verbal subtexts or body language, will actually demonstrate to her higher value, escalate the interaction, and make her laugh (All of which will increase attraction). 


(Don't be aloof when a girl flirts in a direct manner, e.g. telling you she likes you, that you're attractive, or anything else that can be taken as directly coming onto you. If a girl decides you're cute or cool enough to break the social norm and be direct, you best be direct too)



**EXAMPLES OF ALOOFNESS IN ACTION:**

*1). Girl: ""Are you gay?""*

A girl asking you if you're gay is on the same level as if she asked you if you were single. It means she's interested in you, because: 1. Girls think gay guys are hot (Well-dressed, clean) 2. She wants to know if she has a chance. 

You could say answer with ""No."" or ""Why? Are you interested?"" (A favorite here). The second response is better because it's not straightforward (+1), and takes some amount of confidence (+1). 

OR, you can choose to go the aloof way.

*""Are you gay?""*

*""Whyy does every girl keep asking me that??""*

This is a much better answer because she's being indirectly flirtatious, which will be taken as a sign of obvious interest by her, other girls, and more socially-aware guys. You say: No, I'm not gay, and it answers her question but doesn't do anything else. If she also did that as a shit-test, you failed. You say: ""Why? Are you interested?"" and it shows that you get she's flirting and you're into it, but it's a little cocky (Cocky's good but aloof's better!), and she can easily get embarrassed and defensive: ""No! I was just asking"" *ignores you for the rest of the night*

But if you look her straight in the eyes, smirk, and say in a jokingly whiny voice: ""Whyy does every girl keep asking me that??"" (Yes that punctuation was important enough to repeat, it changes the sentence's tone), she’ll have a laugh and she’ll know you’re interested (You demonstrated it non-verbally), and that it also implies you get asked that all the time by other girls (Pre-selection. All girls know this is a flirtatious question). 


*2). Girl that you're obviously hitting on: ""Why don't you have a girlfriend?""*

Again, this is also a indirectly flirtatious question. She's curious because it *seems* like you should, because you come off like a cool, attractive dude. This is always a shit-test, and/or a question to determine if you're a player. 

Also, this is a stupid fucking question. To ask anyone. Seriously. There's absolutely no good, straightforward answer to this question, which is why it's always a shit-test from girls. 

Choose aloof:
*""Why don't you have a girlfriend?""*

*""Because I don't know how to talk to girls!! Will you teach me?""*

Again, same principles. It's an indirectly flirtatious question, and you're *verbally* brushing off what she considers to be a fairly obvious sign of interest. But, you're the one who came up to her hitting on her, and you're staring her right in the eyes and saying all the right things. You obviously know how to talk to girls. Your response makes her laugh, she starts complimenting you (""Yes you do, you're so funny, witty, etc) and the most passive-aggressive question she could've ever asked a stranger is successfully deflected without being wimpy (Beta-response) or sleazy (PUA-response). 


*3). Girl: ""I wish I had a guy."" ""I'm having a lot of trouble finding a boyfriend."" ""No cool guys want to date me.""*

She has to be giving off some big IOIs when saying this one (Otherwise it's just a girl bitching). Any variation of this + eye contact and a smile means you're in. But you don't say something like: ""Aw I'm sure you'll find someone."" or ""I'll be that guy!!"" or all is lost.

Alooof:
*""I'm having a lot of trouble finding a boyfriend.""*

*""Ohmygod, me too! Whenever I walk around on campus and see a couple kissing or holding hands, I just get so pissed, but then I have to try and get as close as possible without them noticing because it's the only intimate contact I get.""*



**DO YOU SEE WHY ALOOF?**

Being aloof works on so many levels. You notice that all of the examples from the girls could also be considered shit-tests. Being aloof *passes* the shit-test by not being straightforward and making her laugh, but it also doesn't reward her behavior (Because shit-tests are fucking stupid) by giving her validation.  

It increases her attraction to you because being aloof takes: Self-awareness, confidence, wit, a solid understanding of body language, vocal tonality, and timing, and (What girls appreciate most-of-all), not taking yourself so seriously. It's cockiness without being cocky, self-deprecating without being self-deprecating. That's aloofness in seduction. Girls are socially aware enough to immediately recognize and acknowledge everything going on behind an aloof comment, even if it's just subconsciously. Aloofness takes being socially-aware to a whole new level; you definitely need some panache to pull it off. 

Best of all, aloofness keeps her guessing. You don't want to overstate your intentions and turn her off, but you don't want to appear to be disinterested, and turn her off. By being aloof, you're keeping her interest by showing your interest in your tone, subtext, and body language, all the while maintaining the ""chase"" aspect of the game. You make an aloof comment, then ask her out five minutes later. 


Note: It *does* require some sort of attraction and intent on her part because being aloof is a *reaction* to a girl's flirtation, not an attitude. 

Also, this sometimes doesn't work on dumb or really drunk girls.

**EDIT:** 

I've read the dissenting replies. Here's my counterpoints and clarification: A lot of contention is just based off of me simply using the word aloof. I literally listed the textbook definition; I do know what it means. James Bond (I've only seen Craig's films) isn't aloof when it comes to women, only to his job. He's just very nonreactive and not emotionally-attached, but he doesn't act distant or cold towards girls; he makes his intentions totally clear and shows empathy to them.

Aloof in the way you guys are describing it would be how Tom Cruise acts as Jack Reacher when that twenty-something girl hits on him at the bar. If you haven't seen it, she sits down at his table and introduces herself. He makes polite conversation with a few very, very slight flirtatious (That's a stretch) asides and completely rebuffs her obvious advances. He then implicitly insults her and calls her a slut. That's aloof, and that doesn't make the girl very happy.

So in this post, I redefined aloof with a twist (Saying one thing and doing another) so that you can pull off brushing-off a girl (As in Jack Reacher) while keeping her interest and raising her attraction. And while being nonreactive, holding your frame, having strong body language, and passing shit-tests (Much of the criticism here says that what I call aloofness is merely a combination of these things), there's more going on behind a truly aloof comment. I want to restate what I said before: Aloofness is cockiness without being cocky, self-deprecating without being self-deprecating, and what makes an aloof comment different from any other response you'd give to a shit-test is that you're showing that you don't take yourself too seriously.

**EDIT 2:**


*The only girls you can truly be traditionally aloof (Cold and emotionally distant is traditional aloofness, and what a bunch of you are saying is the only real aloofness) with are girls that you are not trying to sleep with. Otherwise, acting traditionally aloof with girls that you want to get with is a paradox. It's an act. You're trying to be appear cool and distant, like you don't give a shit about her, even though you actually really want to get to know her and fuck her. It's fake, and girls can see through the act. You can't act like you don't care about a girl while trying to make meaningful conversation with her at the same time.

I'm a little AFC bitch right now, butthurt about my ex-girlfriend breaking up with me.  I'm learning pickup to find, attract, and keep the woman of my dreams, get married, and have a family.  I met this guy only twice, but he randomly called me today.  I told him about it, and he said he had advice for me.  I just knew I had to speak to him.  I'm writing this for you, but also for myself, so I don't forget what I learned tonight.  This guy didn't marry until he was 38, and has been married for about 30 years straight now.  I told him how I've gotten into the habit of going to bars alone and hitting on girls.  He said that was interesting, because he did that when he was my age.  That he got hearbroken like me many times.  He said he had to learn a lot about women growing up, because his dad was useless, and nobody taught him, and so much of what he said sounded like he was a pickup artist, that I knew he was a natural.

**Advice**

He told me that I need to get in control of my emotions.  When women sense an emotional response to something in the relationship, it gives them an opportunity to seize that thread and keep pulling at it until something breaks.  He said that it never stops, and even just recently, his wife told him that she wanted to take a vacation out of the country to visit family.  He really didn't want to go and didn't want her to go, but instead, he said, ""Oh, that sounds like a great idea, honey.""  She wanted to know if he wanted to come.  He said he didn't want to, that he'd rather just stay at home, or go somewhere else, because he's been there a lot.  She went on the trip, and then said that she was thinking about staying for a few days longer.  ""Oh, why don't you just stay for whole extra week if you're having fun?"".  She was back the next day.  This can all be summarized as outcome independence, agree and escalate, and never losing balance.

He also told me that what I needed to do right now was to work on myself.  He also said that working on yourself is a constant process.  He called it ""upgrading"".  Always upgrade, he said.  Work on yourself.  Then work on upgrading other things.  For me, he said this was to learn how to be in control of my emotions, because if I can't do that, then this will happen again.  Women want a strong man, and they constantly test and try to peel away at it if they see an opening.  If you never give them that opening, they won't be able to do anything, and they will stay happy, safe, and content.  He said this is why women love badboys, because they don't have emotions that they can tug on.  But a good guy is someone who has emotions, but is in complete control of them.  I remember telling my girl that I was pretty miserable.  After this instant, I realized that this was completely the wrong thing to do, and I realized how AFC it is.  He agreed.  He said that it isn't a game that he's playing with his wife.  He said it was simply how a man is supposed to be, and that so many younger guys just don't know this.  He said that if I was like this with my ex-GF, he wouldn't be surprised if she came knocking back on my door, if I even wanted that.  He said being in control of your emotions is one of the hardest things in life, but it's what makes you a man.  He said that being emotional is a great thing, and that he is a very emotional person.  But when it comes to women and everything in life, you have to always be in control of them.  He said it isn't a game.  That you're not supposed to play games with the person you love.  You just have to keep control of your emotions, do the opposite of what most boys would do, and be okay with her leaving, even now, after 28 years of marriage.  Like he said, it's hard.

""If you love something, you have to let it go.  If it's love, it'll come back.""

""You can't start love if it isn't there, but if it's truly love, you can't stop it.""

I told him that it'll take a few months to get over it.  He said, ""No, it takes 3 weeks to change a habit.  She might be on your mind still, but it can be over quicker if you take an active role of changing your habits.""  This made me feel awesome, because I know I don't have to be stuck in the doldrums of love for so long, as long as I truly make an effort to change my habits.

**Context:**

My ex-girlfriend told me that she sometimes preferred hanging out with her friends rather than me.  I always tried to not be needy and let her do what she wanted.  However, I know I gave a very slight emotional response a few times, and she kept putting me in similar situations to keep prying at this weak spot I revealed.  I know you get more chances to fix stuff in a relationship, and had I known better, I would have stopped giving these emotional responses.  She also had some differences in personality that might have led to an eventual breakup, but I'm certain the reason it crumbled is because of these emotional responses.  Women will unknowingly destroy relationships if they can.  That's part of being a woman and how they find a strong, good man.  I stopped reading seddit and posting actively, because I felt I couldn't get good advice on PUA relationships here.  I went to relationship_advice and got shitty advice there, most likely from women.  He said that there are tonnes of people out there with the wrong answer.  He said that I need to find the people who have something to show for it.  He said if you need help accomplishing something, whether it's college, work, etc.  You should talk to people who have already accomplished it.  I've followed that advice so far from people who have gone out in the field and have great game.

This girl always told me I was super attractive, charming, funny, intelligent, and hard-working.  Her parents and family adored me.  Her friends would buy me drinks at the bar.  I am complete boyfriend material, with money, my own pad, a car, a job, many good friends, and a life outside of work.  It doesn't matter, despite all these things.  I knew from the start that they didn't matter, and that PUAs know better...why it is that badboys can get women when nice guys can't.  Despite this, all women want a great man such as myself.  But what will make her attracted isn't what makes you great, but what makes you a man.

**Going forward:**

I posted this, because for the last several days, I don't know what I did wrong, if anything.  I didn't know what behavior to avoid in the future, if anything.  I tried to use some David DeAngelo cocky and funny type gimmicks to eke the relationship on, but ultimately there was a rather quick breakdown of things, because I can't control my emotions.  I used to think that wearing my emotions on my sleeves was a good thing.  It is a good thing in some ways.  It's good to show that you're upset when you're having a bad day from work, or to show your happiness when you are enjoying your girl's company.  It's bad to show your emotions when they show you are weak in the relationship.  But don't be mean about being 100% in your own space, thinking about yourself first.  Just be unreactive, nonchalant, and kind of positive.  He also said to not show too much enthusiasm when saying stuff like ""Oh, you should stay another week."".  He suggested looking into and reading about something called human mood.  I don't know what that is, but he said it explains a lot.  I'm going to read about it and report back if there's anything good in it.  I'm not going into AFC mode though.  I raged hard the past few days, hit on tonnes of girls, and got some numbers, but it was mostly to fill a void that can't really be filled.  It just has to take time, and I just have to improve myself even more.


**TLDR:** Advice from an old natural about women and relationships.  Knowledge like this is extremely rare and precious, and I wanted to share it.

Note: His wife is hot as hell, and he's sort of average looking, not super tall, but definitely a character.  I've only met him twice before, and he is a such a giver.  His wife made me dinner, because I couldn't eat all day.  Yesterday is the first day I've been able to sleep without alcohol, not even wanting it.

Second Note: Just like the hottest women are the ones with the strongest shit tests and bitch shields, the best women are the ones who will scratch at you trying to pull out an emotional reaction.  They are the ones who have high standards and require any man they're with to be completely stable.  They can get fooled by bad boys.  Worse women are the ones who will settle for a boy who is successful, smart, etc., but not emotionally stable.  They are okay with this, because worse women have lower standards in a man.  I want a 10 on the outside and the inside, and the only way for this to happen is for me to be a true man.

1365717998.0,467,self.seduction,1c5y0a,Alpha male mindset: Conveying high status and high value through your actions,589,122,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1c5y0a/alpha_male_mindset_conveying_high_status_and_high/,"One of the best ways to earn respect and admiration from those around you as well as to attract women is to show that you are a high status individual with high self value. Power can easily be conveyed with these two traits.

On showing High Status:

High status can be defined as a position of prominence or importance compared to other people around you. Someone with high status is most likely someone you look up to try to emulate. High status is also one of the elements that woman find very attractive. 

To convey to others that you are a man with high status, you don't need a Ferrari or a six figure job. The best way to channel to people around you that you have high status is through body language. 

1. Have your shoulders pushed back and stand straight, don't slouch or appear weak when you are with men and woman. Slow down your general movements, it shows that you are in control of yourself.

2. Make sure to slow down when talking, pause for effect, and practice a masculine tone. Breath slow when talking to woman, many don't see the big deal in this but it is a very subtle way to show that you have confidence.

3. Have your head face straightforward and your eyes ahead of you, never be caught looking down on the ground while walking.

4. When standing or walking, keep your hands out of your pockets, many view it as a sign of insecurity. Don't cross your arms when talking either, it can be seen as being closed off to others.

5. Sit up straight or lean back slightly, always have your shoulders pushed back when sitting. Feet shoulder width apart and hands on your on top of your legs. 

6. If you have any bad habits, such as unintentional twitching or any erratic body movements when standing or sitting, get rid of them. People with high status have a steady frame when interacting with others.


On conveying high self value:

High self value can be defined as someone's overall self evaluation and sense of self worth of themselves. People with high self value give off a positive vibe and are appreciated by their peers. A man with high value has a much higher chance of winning over women compared to the man with low self value.

The best way to show others that you have high self value is through how you treat yourself and how you treat those around you.

1. Do not doubt yourself out loud ever, whether alone or in public. If you are wrong about something, admit to it, and move on. 

2. Do not bitch, moan, or whine. Instead of complaining about a problem take action and do something about it.

3. Carry yourself in a positive manner no matter where you are, believe in yourself and be confident no matter what situations you may face.

4. Always be improving yourself, no matter what the area of expertise that you are trying to work on. Lead by example to those around you.

5. When with others, leave them better off than they were before. Give them value and be appreciative of them. Be open and friendly, offer support to those in need of it.

6. If someone attempts to lower your self value, do not let it phase you. Stooping down to their level is childish and makes you seen in a negative light to those around you. 

7. Don't take everything so seriously. Do not care what others opinions are of you. Stand up for your own beliefs and values.

8. When a girl is acting out of line. Put your foot down and let her know your boundaries, do not let her push you around. (Note for clarity: Putting your foot down is assertion, complaining that the girl is out of line is bitching) 

Following this guide is one of the easiest and quickest ways to becoming a man with high status and high value.

So I recently went through a pretty major change in my life, which ended in my becoming much more confident than I ever was before. Also its the first time in a really long time where I've been psychologically healthy, confident, and single.

Anyway, I learned this simple (maybe even obvious) but effective trick. Whenever any pretty girl used to glance at me and make eye contact with me, I would quickly look away, as if to seem uninterested and then somehow attractive. However, what I've been doing recently is whenever a pretty girl makes eye contact with me, I keep looking at her for just a HALF moment longer than she might expect... Then I smile at her. 

Seriously 9 out of 10 girls respond by smiling back at me, usually flirtaciously. Either on the street, or in a store, or in a bar, it is so consistently effective! 

Anyone else have this experience? If not, you should try it! Girls are so charmed by confidence. It can make you so much more attractive to them.

EDIT: Uninterested and disinterested are 2 different things.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1372174050.0,,,True,t3_1h0har,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1h0har/a_simple_but_incredibly_effective_tip/,
1364433764.0,465,self.seduction,1b5e44,Here’s a story I hope will inspire you. This is my transformation. Also a BIG thank you to seddit.,569,104,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1b5e44/heres_a_story_i_hope_will_inspire_you_this_is_my/,"What's up seddit, here's the story of how I changed myself, from highschool to now (I'm 21). It's a little long, so bear with me.. To be clear, I'm far from being a PUA, but I'm definitely... something, haha. I hope this will help some of you out there relate to this and realize that it's never really over, and even though you feel immensely desperate and at a loss, you can still switch it all around with time and effort.

**Highschool and early college**

So it all starts when I'm in 10th grade in highschool. By this time I was a lonely mess starting to get out of his teenage years. My father was rather absent from my life from about when I was 10 years old and onwards, and it definitely took its toll on my development. No masculine presence to identify myself to in my teens. He used to involve me in several sports: not anymore, so I reverted to video games and reading, and preferred those activities to chilling with friends.

I'd fall for girls really easily, but *never* show it to them, not knowing how to. I'd spend my nights on MSN messenger, waiting for the girls I loved to log on and proceed to chat with them like an extremely needy bitch. I was desperate, and lonely. My heart was broken over and over again. One time, a girl I loved made out with a guy she had disqualified to me, right in my face. That event alone plunged me in a pretty deep depression.

I graduated highschool and started college in a completely depressed state. Skipping class or arriving drunk/stoned in them. I was a wreck. I also wasn't realizing the consequences of my actions and I wasn't taking responsibility for them. Always blaming external factors. I got into a 1 month relationship with a girl I wasn't into because I was desperate. I was practically misogynistic: slut shaming women all the time for banalities. Putting them on pedestals, not even considering their emotions, but instead seeing them as ""trophies"" that you had to ""conquer"" as if it was against their will. My social life was completely fucked. I felt I was doing nothing with my life, that it was going down the drain and that I'd never attract women. I was seeing everyone around me getting into relationships (College, huh) and fucking here and there, while I was completely inactive.

People didn't respect me that much, except for my close friends. I didn't take care of myself, dressed horribly and didn't even care about it. When we'd go out to have a few beers I'd sit at the table and watch TV, rarely participating in conversation.

**Then things started to change**

I enjoyed gambling quite a lot (In Quebec the legal age is 18), and I was a poker enthusiast. One day, I fall upon a book by **Joe Navarro**, titled *Read'em and Reap*. It's a book about reading body language to maximize profits in poker.

This led me to discovering ***What Every BODY Is Saying***, by the same author. A book about non verbal communication. I instantly discovered a profound interest on the subject, and decided to apply the concepts to my life. Working in sales, I started paying more attention to the way people act and react to different situations. Every day, I'd really concentrate with every customer I'd help out to determine exactly what it is he/she was thinking or if what I had said was good/bad. I gradually got better and better at it, just as anyone here can. Seriously, pick up that book, it's what opened my mind and ""prepped"" me for the seduction notions I learned 2-3 years later in life.

So my interest for social interactions in general was constantly increasing, yay! But I was still a complete fuck up with women. I never knew how to react with them. I NEVER talked about ANYTHING sexual with them. I was falling for coworkers and (again) never showing it to them, just inviting them out of the blue on a pretty intimate date and always getting rejected. I was a creep, but now at least, I was becoming rather charismatic. I knew how to hold people's attention, tell interesting stories, make people laugh, etc. ***Non verbal communication is the shit, everyone. Read up on it, I URGE you to.***

**Turning point: discovering seddit**

I joined reddit around the end of 2011, and discovered seddit in early 2012. *Guys, I thought this seduction stuff was only true in movies and shit, so you know where the fuck I'm coming from.* I was seeing people recommending *How To Win Friends And Influence People* and *The Game* everywhere, so I decide to check them out. Lo and behold, my mind was fucking blown, by both books. Simple notions such as smiling, complimenting people properly, etc. were dawning on me for the first time. As for Neil Strauss, he completely destroyed my preconceived notion that you had to be a fucking stud to get women. I felt like I had landed on a gold mine. I started going out, *like fucking crazy*. I was fortunate enough to meet a new gang of friends, through my childhood friend, who were natural seducers. We'd go out all the time and I'd watch them do their thing.

These guys gave 0 shits. They walked around the club beaming, laughing, dancing, doing the ""cheers"" to practically everyone they crossed in the club, boy or girl. It felt so good going out with them. I was freaking out. Their behavior was really contagious and I really wanted to *be* like those guys, especially after discovering seddit! I started investing more on my appearance, getting clothes that fit me well, keeping my hair shorter, etc. I started feeling really good about myself. **Guys, nothing boosts your confidence like getting yourself a new look that people notice positively. Try shit out, check male fashion websites. Imitate people who are known for their sense of fashion, etc.** By this time I had also started running regularly, which was making me feel way better in my body and I’m now planning on running my first marathon, next year.  I finally started approaching random girls in clubs, getting rejected and accepted, and **having a fucking good time**. I'd go back home beaming and thoughts about the weekend would be in my head all week, until they were replaced by thoughts of the next. My social life was finally starting to develop itself.

After going out extensively and constantly putting myself out there throughout the whole spring, I started getting into my first relationships in 2 years (since the college one of 1 month haha) in the summer. These were girls I'd seduce in the club, *not* girls from my work or my social circle, which were the ones I'd always get oneitis for before. Fall came around and random girls from school started messaging me on facebook (sometimes girls I didn't even know) because they wanted to talk to me. I was becoming more known. People had noticed my change. *I* had noticed my change.

I was much more confident, I didn't feel afraid to let people know what I thought. I was able to express disagreement in a polite, acceptable way. I trusted my own ideas, and didn't seek the approbation of my peers to make sure they were good. I became a leader. Some girls would fall for me. Some of them even had boyfriends. **Shit finally started working out really well in my everyday life, not just my “clublife”**.

So here I am, tonight, in front of my laptop typing this long-ass post hoping some of you will be inspired by this as I was when I landed on this sub. I decided to write this post after an event that took place 2 weeks ago where a female coworker of mine, who has a boyfriend, admitted her feelings for me. She was a girl I had chased like a needy bitch about 2 years prior, and she rejected me, got into a relationship, etc. The fact she told me she was into me really made me realize the extent of my change, and prompted me to write this. It's like I'm still not grasping this is happening..

If you took the time to read this post, thank you so much, I hope it brought a new perspective to your idea of seduction. I would really like to thank the community for all this, especially the mods Tofu, Curveball and Throwaway. You guys were a true inspiration through it all and you helped me achieve my goal of knowing how to seduce women. I love you guys. I'm getting the hang of it.

**Logistics**

As you gain experience, logistics become the most important aspect of all. **Boys worry about game. Men worry about logistics.** Without a logistical understanding of how you will progress from approach to the bedroom, you are flying blind. Understanding logistics is often the difference between landing the woman of your dreams and going home alone. Let's dig in.

Logistics refers to all the external factors that you can control. How do you ask for the number, what kinds of texts do you send, where do you take her for your first date, how you get her from point A to point B, what do you have in your room. It means having a plan and trusting in it. It also means reflecting on your experience and developing a style that you can comfortably enjoy.

You are not allowed to talk to girls until you go through the next two steps. Trust me on this.

---

**#1: Where can you get her alone? What do you have there?**

Whether you are looking for a one night stand or your next girlfriend, eventually you are going to have to get alone to make out and have sex. Everyone's situation is unique, but the bottom line is you must figure out WHERE you can do this in advance of the date. Obviously if you have your own place in the heart of a big city, you're in good shape, but even if you live with your parents, fear not... Where there's a horny guy, there's a way.

Get creative and really think about all the different locations you can get alone after hours. Is there an isolated beach nearby? Great, go put a couple beach towels in the trunk of you car. Do the seats of your car lay down? Great. Have keys to your office after-hours? Fan-fucking-tastic! And of course you can always try to go to her place (but then you give up a tremendous amount of logistical control, so tread carefully.)

**NOTE: I'm using these as examples of creativity if you don't have a good place to take a girl. However, if you want to get good at this and start really seducing women, you're going to need to get your logistics in order. If you're not working to get into a more logistically-friendly situation, you're making your life much harder than it has to be.**

As for the types of things you need in your place. Honestly, as long as you have a couch or bed, condoms, and music, TV, or a computer, you're in good shape. Everything you add beyond that can be helpful, but no need to go crazy. Adding a bottle of wine and some spirits will be the icing on the cake.

Don't overthink this stuff. Yes, massage oil, hookahs, drugs, sex swings, lube, that mural you painted in art school, and your photo collection from your trip to Peru are awesome, but they're not really helping you get laid. **Keep your place clean and live in a place you are PROUD to be in. That's what is most important at the end of the day.** By the time the girl comes home with you, she is more or less committed to hooking up. I've lived in a 150 square-foot studio and a $4000/month luxury apartment, and neither one helped me pull better than the other.

---

**#2: Know your city and know your neighborhood**

You need to become an expert in your city, its various attractions, bars, restaurants, date spots, etc. Remember back in [Part 2](http://redd.it/11yjkw) when you came up with a list of great date ideas? Yeah, go revisit that list and try harder. Discover all that's great around you. Talk up strangers and ask them for cool things to do. Be a tourist in your own city for a weekend. Love where you live.

A guy who can serve as the gatekeeper to all the wondrous sights and experiences in your city is incredibly attractive. Don't take that lightly. Most people go through life going to the same shitty restaurants and bars every week. But you aren't ""most people."" You are unique and better than them. Women will gravitate to you.

Now that you are starting to really know your city, you need to REALLY know your neighborhood. The more cool little spots you know within immediate distance of your home, the more logistical options you have to move women back towards your apartment.

Visit every single bar and cafe in your neighborhood. Visit every park and shopping center and see what they have to offer. Go on a walking tour next weekend. Know your neighborhood like the back of your hand.

I'll demonstrate why further down below, but more often than not, the best date location will be a random shitty dive bar down the block from your place. A lot of guys take girls to fancy dinners across town, but I would bet every dollar I have that they would have more success taking them to the closest shitty bar.

OK, are you comfortable with your logistics so far? Good, now you're ready to talk to girls again.

---

**#3: Getting her number**

By this point in the guide, you should have some experience opening and conversing with women. If not, go back to the beginning and follow the Action Items. You're doing it wrong.

I'm going to make this section really easy for you. **Getting her number is as simple as saying, ""We should hang out sometime. Let's exchange numbers.""**

No gimmicks, no routines, no pickup lines. If you've gone in with good body language, touch, and conversation, you won't need anything fancy. 

That being said, it ALWAYS makes sense to attempt to do two things:

* 1) Plant the seeds for your date ahead of time. Find out what she likes. Bring up that awesome bar/art gallery/cafe/whatever that she would like that you've researched ahead of time. Adding, ""Hey we should go to [INSERT VENUE] together"" to your attempt to get her number will almost always increase your chances.

* 2) Throughout the course of flirting and building rapport, try to manufacture an inside joke, reference, or playful nickname. You can reference this in your text messages later on. David Wygant refers to this as ""bringing her back to the moment"" and it's a tried and true method. 

*Real-world Examples:*

* A girl wouldn't give me her name upfront. I said, *""Fine, if you won't tell me your name I'm just going to call you Larry.""* This caused her to feign offense (a common thing girls do when they are attracted to your polarizing attempts) which led to a passionate exchange. I could then text, *""Yo Larry, what are you doing this weekend?""* which brought her back to the moment when she felt strong attraction to me.

* I asked a girl to watch my jacket, telling her it was a matter of national security, pretending I was in the CIA. I continued this inside joke between us throughout the night. When I began texting her, I could say *""Tonight's my last night before the agency reassigns me. Wanna make waffles and have a pillow fight?""*

As you develop your personality and spontaneity, come up with your own teases, jokes, and nicknames. It's fun and gives every interaction its own unique essence. Oh, and put a little note referencing this next to her name in your address book.

One final tip... When you get her number, I find it powerful to throw in a *""Now you're not one of those girls who flakes all the time, right?""* in a somewhat accusatory tone. It implies a set boundary that you won't tolerate girls who flake on you. Firm values and boundaries are hot.

---

**#4 Texting the girl &amp; setting up dates**

After getting the number, it's usually a good idea to send a *""Did you get home safe?""* text later that night. It solidifies the connection and your concern for her will make her more comfortable. If you met her during the day, or through a social function, calibrate your text accordingly.

As far as general texting goes... There are plenty of guys who text humorous notes, sexy one-liners, and get girls to open up, building attraction through dozens of text exchanges. This can be very effective, so if it works for you, that's awesome.

My stance, however, is that great men don't waste time texting inane messages all day long. **The best text game is building extreme attraction before you ever get her number.** That way, you can stick to texting only for scheduling real-life meetups where you can escalate physically. Do you really feel that 140 characters on a small LCD screen properly represents who you are? I certainly don't.

Here are my favorite texts to use. Feel free to use them often. They work.

* **""How's your day going?""** (Give her a chance to respond. Her lady parts will tingle when she gets a message from ""that cool guy she met."" You sexy devil you!)

* **""What's your schedule like this week?""** (Let her tell you when she's free. She's not dumb, she knows you're going to follow up with a plan to meet. She is basically telling you when to schedule it.)

* **""Sweet. Come to [INSERT VENUE] with me. I'll be there Thursday at 8.""** (Hot girls HATE when men require lots of back and forth to schedule plans. Be upfront with her. She will appreciate it.)

As always, plan to calibrate to her responses and be flexible within reason. Do your job during the initial interaction and text game becomes the simplest thing in the world. No more ""rules.""

---

**Dates**

Plan your dates in advance with a mental map for how you're going to get her from point A to point B. Yes, that art gallery all the way across town sounds awesome (and by all means, if YOU want to go, GO!) but it's not going to be ideal for getting her to the final destination (on top of your penis.)

I always start out by suggesting a shitty bar near my place. Why near my place? Because it will make moving her there 10 times easier than if we have to drive across town. Why a shitty bar? Because then I can use my favorite line in all of seduction, *""This bar kinda sucks. I have some wine at my place, let's go drink there.""*

Some tips for what to during the date:

* Hug her at the start, and give her a kiss if you have made out before.
* Don't even discuss who pays the bill. If you have the money, pay for the date. If you need her to chip in, start going on cheaper dates.
* If you follow my advice and do your first date at a bar, you can say, ""I'll get the first round"" and pay cash. This solves a lot of the cash flow issues.
* Try to sit in a corner booth or at the bar so your legs can touch. This will let you maintain strong physical contact and physically escalate.
* Sometimes, if you are feeling resistance, planning multiple venue changes throughout the night will work in your favor. (Bar A -&gt; Bar B -&gt; Walk on the beach -&gt; Your apartment)
* Every thirty minutes or so, try to point out what you like about your date. All women want to feel desired and wanted. Let her know why you desire her!
* If you're not 21, or don't set foot in bars, a cafe or a walk on the beach is almost as good.
* ALWAYS BE ESCALATING! (More on this in the next chapter)

You must have a plausible reason for why you're bringing her back to your place. Yes, you both kinda-sorta know it's for sex, but that's not how it works in the real world. Even if it's just to drink that wine, or check out that new Youtube video, or show her your stamp collection, you need to plan this ahead of time. Experience certainly pays dividends here, but the truth is, as long you have done a good job generating attraction thus far, you'll be fine.

Expect her to offer some resistance when you try to bring her home. Throwing out a ""I don't sleep with someone on the first date."" or ""No sex, okay?"" will do wonders. It all helps to generate *plausible deniability.* If it *just happened while we were in the moment* she will feel much more comfortable knowing she fooled around with you. No girl wants to feel like a slut. It's your job, as the man, to make her as comfortable as possible. Also when you start to fool around, *""I don't kiss and tell.""* goes a long, long way.

**Action Items**

1) Follow parts 1 &amp; 2 above to the letter. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200 until you do this. This is one of the most important things you'll ever do for your love life.

2) Get out your notebook. Write out 30, 60, and 90 day plans for how you are going to improve your logistical situation. Repeat until you are happy with your situation (*aka no longer living with your mom.*)

2) Go out with the goal of getting phone numbers. Follow the advice above and try for 10 numbers. Then 20. Then 30. You need to gain experience with a variety of women. There is no way to gain this other than brute force.

3) Text the numbers you receive and try to set up first dates. Try to schedule 5-10.

4) During these dates, try to work on changing locations. First to another neutral venue, then to your home. (**THIS IS IMPORTANT: Your goal is merely to get her to come home with you, don't even worry about sex. This subtle change in mindset has proven very effective for me. Sex is a natural by-product of the process.**)",Comprehensive,False,,t5_2qhrv,1374516744.0,,,True,t3_1dtb8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1dtb8m/above_the_game_part_6_logistics_getting_the/,moderator

I am not a major player in this sub. I don't have a largely active history in the seduction community. I am not a natural. I was neither a player, nor an alpha male from birth. What I am, gentlemen, is just a natural learner. I'm skilled at adapting and evolving who I am for the better. That is my only claim to success. I pulled himself up, gained confidence, and started being pleased with myself, all on my own. I can talk to a lady I find attractive at Barnes &amp; Noble/Sear's/Joe's Crab Shack/wherever, and if we click, I take her out. I'm involved in this community because I want my fellow men to be the best they can; and because I know that I can never stop improving myself as well. I'm here for you.

I want to see my fellow man pick himself up, go out on the town, have a blast with a stranger that they are attracted to, and get what they want out of the night. I want to help people that *want* to improve; to give others what they need to at life, starting from the inside, out.

Now I've got some bad news: Here's where this starts to be a rant. We have a cancer. It's killing us slowly. We need to burn this tumor out, gentlemen, and the effort starts with *YOU.*

You know what's killing us, guys? When fellow members of this community come rolling in, seduce a girl, lead her on to think there's something more, and kick her to the curb after a one-night stand so they can move to the next piece of meat. You know what's killing us, guys? When we objectify the holy fuck out of everything. You know what's killing us, guys? When we use any means necessary to justify the end. You know what's killing us, guys? That piece of shit TV show that teaches you how to be a “pick up artist” when most of the time they just hit the club, find the drunkest women they can, and take them home.

The Golden Rule, gentlemen... **The. Golden. Rule.** Do you remember what it is? It is “*ALWAYS* leave them better than you found them.” I know you've heard it before. It's one of the first statements given by almost every master PUA. You know why? **Because it is the first rule that is always forgotten.** I know I have, plenty of times.

Look at it like this, here's how you can tell if this post pertains to you or not: Look at all the women in your life that you care for. Your mother, sisters, daughter, whatever. Imagine someone doing to them what you are doing to the ladies you are talking to. Would you be pleased with someone seducing your daughter, taking her home, leading her on, sleeping with her, and never talking to her again, and remembering her only as “HB6” on some invisible corner of the internet? What about your mother? The mentality of “I *need* to take these steps so I can sleep with this girl *ASAP*” is not only flawed, but it's unhealthy.

Now hold on, I know what you're thinking: “B-b-but, TheGamble, what are we supposed to do?” Take it easy. I understand. Remember, I'm one of you and I love you, and I want you to be the best. This is where the rant ends, and the want for improvement begins.

I *want* you to go out on the town. I *want* you to have a good time. I *want* you to approach women you have an attraction towards, I *want* you to talk to them, and I *want* you to have fun with human beings. *Not* pieces of meat. I want you to be able to look back on this time in your life and be able to tell your spouse/children/self that you were a confident, funny, socially-active, attractive young man, *without* having to personally censor all of the horrible shit you did to people along the way.

Be clear about your intentions before you sleep with someone. If you think “I'm only sexually attracted to you,” is going to turn the girl off and make her not want to have sex with you, you know what you do then? You still have a good fucking night, guys. Fuck the sex. This isn't even ABOUT the women. **This is about you**... you growing into the best you can be, having fun along the way, cherishing this time of your life, and being a *POSITIVE INFLUENCE* on everyone you meet. Don't drag this community into the depths of misogynistic sleazy shame it's currently headed for.

I *want* you to post Field Reports. I *want* you guys to help each other out. I *want* you guys to grow. I *want* you to have fun, successful nights with ladies you are attracted to, and I *want* those ladies to have genuinely good times with you, too. I *want* you to be happy with who you are, because that is the most important thing. If you aren't happy with yourself, nobody else will ever make you happy. I **need** you guys to be so goddamn happy, confident, charismatic, and badass human beings that I would introduce you to my sister if you asked; and I need you to respect the fellow human beings you interact with.

Go ahead, downvote this to hell, but I'm going to love you anyways. Just understand that you are the only person that can answer for your actions when you self-reflect years down the road.

1347329740.0,453,self.seduction,zoqsu,Why Yoga will help your game,562,109,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/zoqsu/why_yoga_will_help_your_game/,"I'm new to pickup but not to Yoga. Seeing a lot of parallels as I learn more about this. Taken a lot from this community so wanted to add this for anyone who hasn't considered this before.

1) Breathing

Yeah yeah, you do it all the time, but gaining control of your breath can help you overcome AA. Ever feel like you approached and the anxiety took over? Were you breathing? Probably not. Yoga teaches you to use your breath to maintain control over your emotions and physical behavior. This has helped me more in professional contexts than pickup (to date). I've been presenting in front of dozens of people and felt 'the fear' coming on, only to re-gain control by focusing inward - simply on my breathing. Then - you kill it. 

2) Body Language

Yoga is all about alignment. Shoulders back, spine long, chest forward. Throughout all the poses. After you practice yoga for a while, you just 'walk' differently. That whole ""imagine a string pulling your head"" thing doesn't even need to be thought about. It's just how you stand and walk. Since I got out of my LTR 2 months ago women have just been talking to me more, and last weekend a WW's girlfriend asked me ""how did you go from 5 years w/ 'ex' to this?"". I told her security. But it's my body language that conveyed it, not what I was saying. 

3) Exercise

I'm not really a gym rat. It just gets boring. I've been implementing 2 weight work outs a week with my standing 2-3 yoga classes and I am shaping up quickly. And it's fun - my body never really knows what to expect. Throw in a few days a week of x-training / running and you'll see results fast. 

4) Practice... not the Yoga kind.

Women are really hot in Yoga classes. And they don't wear any clothes. They aren't going there to pick up, and they are covered in sweat after the class, but I've been able to successfully open a few just by standing next to them in practice. Not a lot of guys do Yoga... capitalize on it. 

5) Inner Game

How do you build confidence? By defeating your inner demons. We've all got them. We all ignore them, it's easy to - especially if you're successful in your career. Yoga is half work out, half meditation, and that shit comes out in your practice. When you've been standing on one leg for 5 minutes and you keep falling you realize the same shit keeps going through your head. Make a mental note to journal on that later.  By actually working through your shit it will no longer control you - you'll begin controlling it. Then your best self starts shining through. 

If you haven't tried yoga, give it a go.

1341583915.0,457,self.seduction,w4nrd,How a girl wants to be picked up at a club,761,304,344,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/w4nrd/how_a_girl_wants_to_be_picked_up_at_a_club/,"Someone posted a thread in AskReddit asking how to pick up a girl at a club. Didn't get much attention, but I (female, 21) wrote up this simple step-by-step guide of what works on me and many of my female friends. Thought you might appreciate it.

American guys seem to always go for the grinding, which I hate, at least this is what I've noticed from my first year in the States. Back home in Germany right now, I've been trying to figure out how guys pick up girls here, because I just find it so much more pleasant. This seems to be the common way to do it. Really wish it was more common in the States. 

1. Choose target. 

2. Start dancing near here, where she can see you. 

3. Try to make eye contact. Smile if eye contact is achieved. If she smiles back, come a little closer. 

4. If she doesn't move away or show discomfort, reach out your hand.

5. If she takes your hand pull her a little closer. Not so close that you're forced to rub your crotches against each other. Just close enough so that it is established that you 2 are dancing together. **Edit:** If you are confused about how the hell you're supposed to dance with a girl without rubbing your penis on her: Just be relaxed, fun and flirty. A little goofy maybe? Eye contact. Smile. Spin her around. If she absolutely wants to feel your package rubbing against her for whatever reason, she will initiate grinding. 

6. If she seems to be having a good time with you and doesn't try to get the fuck away ASAP, you've already won. Ask if she wants a drink/go outside for fresh air and have some nice conversation. Be a gentleman.

If you do this I'm sure any girl would highly appreciate the fact that you didn't just come up from behind and start danceraping her. You're bound to get at least a phone number from it. This has worked on me and other female friends many times. 

If at any point during this process she shows discomfort just get the fuck away from her or you will forever be known as that creepy stalker dude at the club who kept staring at her.

1329326038.0,450,self.seduction,pqwi3,My Personal Summary from the Neil Strauss IAMA,547,97,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pqwi3/my_personal_summary_from_the_neil_strauss_iama/,"This is my summary of things that would be most related to r/seduction.  Most of these are from Neil, however some are from his helpers. I figured this post would be a good place for us to discuss the following ideas.


**On Direct vs. Indirect Game**

On how pick up is now generally moving away from routines/indirect and towards just pure direct intent. How do you feel about this? 

* 	Trends in pickup are kind of idiotic. One does what works.

Great quote from a Redditor:

* 	""Look guys, there's no single right way to be a boxer - if you're hitting your opponent more than he's hitting you, you're doing it right! i'm just showing you what works best for most people"". 


**More Direct PUA Tips**


On Looks

* 	If you can't fix it, feature it.'

On Peacocking

 * [the line is] Are you wearing the clothes or are they wearing you?

How to game in a small college/small social circle

* If it's a small town and you see everyone a lot, you don't have to make sure you do EVERYTHING in one meeting. Each time you see them, you can add a little piece and let the attraction grow more naturally (and also more subtly).

Favorite place to meet new people:

* Coffee shops are always great. Where ever you go talk to everyone. You'll find the best place that way.

Information Overload

* And don't become an information junkie. Just take the material you need RIGHT NOW to get past your current sticking point. Then use it to get past that point. Then go back to the well and get what you need next. There's a form of procrastination called perfect preparation. And it ends with guys buying a lot of ""products"" and not getting outdoors and actually socially interacting.

**Inner Game and Approach Anxiety Related** 


4 Rules on Approach Anxiety

* Rule one of AA: Life is fun if you open your mouth.

* Rule two: You’re always in the field.

* Rule three: We miss 100 percent of the shots we don’t take.

* Rule four: The only failure is not approaching 

 On Approach Anxiety

* Yes [I still get approach anxiety], and in fact, the better I got, the more approach anxiety I developed. This is because people start to know who you are, and expect miracles and no failures. There is only one way to get over it: to approach. Right away. The longer you wait, the more the fear builds. Just accept it as a normal evolutionary response, but also a vestigial holdover fear from a tribal society that no longer really has a purpose.

What should you do when your mind goes blank?

* This is where canned material really becomes useful. Their response gives you a chance relax a bit and catch your bearings. However, sometimes a simple long pause to catch yourself can speak volumes of sincerity... When I blank out I usually just have a canned phrase (""How's your life?"") Or if I do it twice (""You're not entertaining me very well"") 

When asked about the worst Blowout/Rejection: 

* Funny that you ask that, because I think it says more about your fears. Most guys do NOT experience horrific blowouts. Usually it's just someone saying ""I have a boyfriend"" or ""I have to go to the bathroom"" or just being a little cold and distant. The questions says more about your own limiting beliefs, so get out there and approach people and prove yourself wrong.

No one is perfect: everyone has some type of psychological issue:

* Oh, absolutely, a lot of the guys have psychological issues. I think everyone has psychological issues, in the world, just about--no one was raised perfectly. But I think the psychological issues in the community are more about men's low self-esteem, and not about negative attitudes towards women. In fact, as I write it, I realize their negative attitude is only toward themselves. So if their experience in the community fixes this, then that's a good thing.

**Socializing in General**

On social isolation from others due to using technology: 

* Every hour i spend socially interacting staring at a screen here probably lowers my comfort with socially interacting IRL. So the burden again is on the individual to make sure their life is in balance. And that becomes more challenging the more great tools people create online.

How to creating a cool social circle and be the leader of the social circle:

* Shortcut: Bring together different people who don't know each other. You become the leader. Good way to cultivate those skills.

On sarging every night to improve: 

* It's funny that guys think it has to be ""every night."" You don't have to go out of your way to do it. If you ever leave your house, there are opportunities to talk to someone: in the elevator, at lunch, in the street, at a gas station/bodega, etc. And it doesn't have to be someone you're attracted to: talk to anyone, just to get used to being social.

On people who are assholes/bitches

* Interesting question, and I've had people be rude, but generally it was just a wall, and once I got through it, they turned out to be a great person. I suppose assholes are like bitches: we think someone is like that, but that's only because they somehow threatened our sense of self and self-esteem--and if we see them with empathy, in most cases, we realize they're just as insecure as we are, if not more so.

**Relationship Related**

Moving from friends with benefits to more:

* And here's your answer: people tend to step up when they have a fear of losing something. So if he sees a guy is interested in you, and you may be interested in him, his feelings may start to change. What turns off a guy a girl is sleeping with is the same thing that turns off a girl a guy wants to sleep with: desperation and neediness. So eliminate those from your behavior in the friends-plus-ship.

On how to deal with a person who “is not looking for a relationship at this time”: 

* One step at a time. Attraction first, then escalation, then start a casual non-exclusive relationship, then see what happens. Even when someone isn't looking for a relationship, love can catch them unaware and they'll then want to be in one. That said, get to know her first, who she really is, and make sure you really WANT to be in relationship with her. Big mistake is when anyone gets into a relationship too quickly, is not compatible, and then can't get out of it. 

On wanting something that you can’t/don't have:

* Isn't that so true: people don't appreciate it while they have it, then when it's gone they do. My sincere guess is that this is mostly your ego state. And as soon as you have her back and are confident that the relationship is 100 percent on again, you will start not appreciating her again. So first you have to examine your true intentions and motivations here. Because if you do get her back, and then change your mind again or have doubts again, that's not fair to her.

1362428078.0,454,self.seduction,19nodo,"Building attraction with ""text game.""  The unexplored frontier.",606,152,179,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/19nodo/building_attraction_with_text_game_the_unexplored/,"I've seen so many shitty posts on text game, I decided I would lay to rest all the misconceptions and poor advice by giving some actual USEFUL advice.

So many other posts I've flipped through summarize texting as unimportant, or merely a tool to schedule and confirm a date.  This is completely the opposite of the truth.  The vast majority of girls LOVE texting FREQUENTLY.  They do it all day long with their friends.  If they're in a relationship, usually they do it all day long with their boyfriends.  There's no reason why you shouldn't be texting back and forth the same way.  Of course there are exceptions, some girls are busy and don't have time to exchange 100 texts a day.  But still, if they're interested they will make the attempt when they have time and will appreciate the thought.

Let's say you meet a girl on a Thursday night at a bar and schedule a date for Sunday.  That's all day Friday and Saturday that she won't be seeing you or talking to you.  By the time Sunday rolls around, do you really think she's looking forward to seeing a guy she just met at the bar three days ago when she was drunk?  NOPE.  Chances are good she will flake by the time Sunday rolls around if you haven't stoked the flame somehow either via text or actual phone coversation.  Or she'll go on the date and be generally apathetic about it.

**Texting is momentum.**  If you have no momentum, your date will start off slow and awkward, because lets face it: you're basically complete strangers.  If you DO have momentum, you'll both be walking into the date ""in state"" because you're looking forward to the date and you've become acquainted and even more attracted to the other person through text messages.

* What the fuck should I text her?

Text her e-card memes.  Ask her what she's doing right now.  Ask her what she's wearing right now, followed by telling her you're wearing a revealing sexual outfit (silly but setting the sexual groundwork).  BE AMBIGUOUS.  Make her wonder whether you were being sexual or not.  Give her soft-tosses for sexual convo.  If she asks what you're doing right now, ""I'm about to get nekkid and hop into the shower.""

If she reciprocates in kind, she's interested.  If she reciprocates and even initiates texting on her own, she's seriously interested.  If she gives one-line response or responds infrequently, just ask her straight-up: ""I'm not feelin' the love here, I'm throwing in the towel unless you give me a good reason why an awesome guy like me should stick around (add winky face or some emoticon bullshit).""  Remember, YOU'RE the one who needs to be convinced that SHE is awesome.  You already know you're awesome, right?  If she's interested, she will apologize profusely and change behavior, if not, move on.

**Compatibility**

Really pay attention to the following words. The majority of failed relationships could have been avoided if they took this advice...

At some point, when you feel her falling for you, you need to start finding out if you're actually compatible. Take some time to ask yourself:

* Do you want kids? How many?
* Where do you want to live? A house in the suburbs? Out in the country? An apartment in midtown Manhattan?
* Is religion important to you? Do you want your children growing up with a certain religion? Are you dead-set on an atheist upbringing or would you be open to adapting to your partner's faith?
* How do you envision family life working? Is being close with your parents and relatives important to you?
* Do you prefer to live for the now and save later? Or save for retirement now?
* Are you looking for an open relationship where you can date other women? How do you envision that working?
* Do you want to travel the world? Do you enjoy traveling?

Think about these questions INDEPENDENTLY of the girls you are seeing. It might be wise to think about these when you are completely single and unattached. Hell, write out your answers to these! You'll want to revisit these from time to time. **Don't ignore this step. Your entire life's happiness depends on this!**

Once you have a good idea of what YOU want out of life, start asking HER the same questions. Don't give her a full CIA interrogation, but do pepper these into conversation as you go from casual to serious. Most of the time, you'll start to notice red flags. That's OK, tell her you want to keep it casual, and if she's open to it, keep enjoying her company on a more casual basis. You are a man of values and you must STICK to those values or they are meaningless.

Compromise is important, but if the idea of your kids growing up Mormon terrifies you, you'd better find out what SHE expects before it's too late!

---

**Commitment**

So you've met a great girl, you've made your intentions and boundaries known, you've gotten to know one another, and you've clicked in the bedroom. You think she might be girlfriend or wife material. Congratulations, that's amazing! Now what?

**A lot of romantic-comedies would have you think you need to stand out in the rain with a bouquet of flowers and ask her to be your girlfriend. Don't do that.**

Do you find yourselves just *assuming* that you are hanging out together on Saturday night? Is that becoming a regular thing? Are you guys becoming increasingly comfortable around one another? Are you getting lazier about tidying up your bathroom before you go see her?

If the answers to all those questions is ""Yes,"" then congratulations, you've got a girlfriend! When the time is right, ask her *""You're committed to this relationship, right?""* No matter her answer, you'll have a very clear understanding where you two stand.

**WARNING:** Just as a word of advice, really ask yourself if you do love this girl or if you just love the *idea* of the girl. For example: Are you forgiving the fact that she's a shitty person because she's really into that random indie band you've seen live 25 times? Spend some time meditating and being introspective about how you really feel before you let things spiral out of control.

**Keeping Her in Love with You**

This is where the fun really begins. You two can grow together, share experiences together, and start building a life together.

It is absolutely critical to NEVER forget why she fell for you in the first place. Go back and re-read [Part 1: Primer On Who You Will Become](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11piau/above_the_game_part_1_primer_on_who_you_will/) and the [Primer on Being a Modern Alpha Male](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/). **You were able to land this amazing woman because you've embodied all those characteristics! Don't fall into the classic trap of forgetting all you've learned just because you have easy access to sex!**

She fell in love with you because:

* *You are a leader.* You take her by the hand and decide how things will be. In the early stage of the relationship, you should be making close to 100% of the decisions. As time goes on, she'll naturally try to suggest things to do. This is perfectly healthy and you should absolutely let her do so, just don't ever give up control entirely. **Women lose respect for men who can't lead.** However, she will naturally try to take ownership of certain parts of the relationship. If she feels like her input isn't valued, her emotions will drift elsewhere. Pick your battles; let her take the lead on things from time to time.

* *You have firm values.* When she does something shitty, you call her out on it. This could be as trivial as showing up 10 minutes late or as big as cheating on you. Whatever it is, you MUST stand up for yourself. Don't be a doormat!

* *You make her feel valued and appreciated.* When she does something adorable that makes you feel warm inside, tell her! Smile genuinely and profess your love from time to time. Affection is sexy as hell when it's not coupled with neediness.

* *You make her feel desired and beautiful.* Never stop seducing your woman. Grab her and rip her clothes off spontaneously. Compliments on her physical beauty are MUCH sexier when they aren't just words. Show her she's beautiful with your actions!

* *You are fun and spontaneous.* Remember all those great date ideas you have? Bust 'em out! Send her mysterious invitations and take her on magic carpet rides. **Your life is awesome and you're letting her ride shotgun in it.** Don't take that offer lightly.

* *You are on a journey towards greatness.* You were in the middle of your self-development journey when you met her. Whether or not you realized it, that fact alone is extremely attractive. It's the same reason women are suckers for starving artists. They value STRIVING FOR GREATNESS as much as greatness itself. Don't ever stop improving! Keep setting higher and higher goals. Don't give up. Don't settle.

---

**Emotions**

Don't be an emotionless shell, but don't pour your entire heart and soul out either. Here are some words to live by: **Share your emotions as a reward for good behavior.**

You know how you love a good blowjob? Imagine you got a blowjob every time you took out the trash. I bet you'd be a lot happier about trash day!

For women, vulnerability is the psychological equivalent of a good BJ. She wants to know your deepest fears and feelings, but don't dole it all out at once. Spreading these deep emotional moments out over the course of a relationship will go a long way towards securing longevity. Show her your vulnerable side, but not all at once.

Once she feels like she completely understands you, the mystery and allure begins to fade. Take your time; you're in it for the long haul.

---

**Jealousy**

Jealousy stems from a fear of loss: A loss of power. A loss of companionship. A loss of control.

Jealousy is borne from a scarcity mindset. One of the key reasons it is so critical to keep working on yourself - to stay on your journey towards greatness - is so you never feel like you've lost your ability to seduce women. Really honestly KNOWING that you have the ability to secure another mate just as good as your current one will help keep you from ever feeling jealous.

That being said, never showing jealousy can diminish how DESIRED she feels. This is a bad thing. This problem can be easily solved, however...

I've heard this from so many women: *""There is nothing hotter than knowing he's the one who's taking me home at the end of the night.""*

You're a secure, confident man, right? So let your girl get dolled up and hit the town! Let her get hit on by other men! **Let her validate her desire to feel sexy. That's an important emotion - don't be a controlling prick by depriving her of it.** Introduce her to people in the bar and don't even mention that she's your girlfriend. Watch as a bunch of guys try to hit on her right in front of you while you smile and watch! That's how you show confidence, men.

Then laugh about it in the car-ride home before you fuck her silly. The rush of emotions she'll experience will drive her mad!

---

**Fun**

Above all else, be fun. A relationship should be absolutely delightful. Couples who have a shared sense of humor tend to last the longest. Looks fade, status fades, but *fun* never goes away.

Say stuff to rile her up. Then say things like, *""Aww, I could never stay mad at you.""* Be silly. Be childish.

You'll want to have established a vibe of being fun and joking around first and you should have done some kino before on her.

NOTE: this is obviously all done playfully (hopefully she's not actually a heroine addict...)

Here's what it is/ how it works:

- she says something weird/stupid
- you say ""are you on drugs or something!? Needle drugs?""
- you hold her arms out straight, with her palms facing up, with your thumbs gently rubbing the joint between her forearms and bicep (acting like your checking for needle marks)
- she'll respond saying ""haha no I'm not on drugs"" (or something like that)
- you say, ""hmmmm... let me check your eyes""
- stare seductively into her eyes to build tension
- note: still be holding her arms, or ideally slide your hands down to hold her hands
- then you say ""yep, your pupils are dilated... either you're on something or your turned on""
- hold eye contact...
- then go from there


This does a bunch of different things: its fun/funny, its challenging (qualifying), its great for kino, the fact that her palms get turned face up is a signal of submission (which makes you seem dominate = alpha), the eye contact mixed with kino builds sexual tension, the last part about saying ""she's on drugs or turned on"" turns things sexual.

I decided to visit my friend in L.A. for five days over new years. We’re planning to chill out and work on some music. I’m at the airport terminal. I arrive about an hour early. I’m sitting there working on my laptop. This girl walks over and sits in one of the seat across from me. Really hot. Young, like 22. Redhead with blue eyes. Legwarmers over her skinny jeans. Right as she's sitting down, I catch a look from her.

I consider talking to her. But there’s nowhere to sit near her. And I’m like fuck it, I didn’t even really do my hair or even put much effort into my clothes. This trip was just to chill out.

They finally start calling our flight. I get into the line behind a different not-so-cute chick. I ask her if they called my zone, number 3. I make some joke about being in the twilight zone. She laughs. I look around and I notice that the hot girl from earlier is looking at us.

We start getting on the plane. Cute 22 year old redhead is a few people in front of me walking through the dock. 

**On the Plane, the Conversation Starts**

On the plane I get to my seat. The gods are smiling down upon me. It turns out the hot young redhead is sitting next to me. I’m in the window seat. She’s in the middle. There’s this asian dude on her left with headphones on looking at photos on his camera.

As I sit down I tell her, “I’m gonna be your neighbor for the flight.” I make some joke about pushing my head aside if she needs to look out the window. She says something else about the rain. 

Then I realize I forgot my headphones in my bag which is stowed away. God dammit. Oh well, I’m not gonna get up now. I’m stuck with no music. I turn to the girl and say, “God damn, I forgot my headphones in my bag. Guess this is gonna be a boring flight.” 

She’s looking at her kindle and I ask her what book she’s reading. We talk about books a bit.  The flight attendant comes by and tells her to shut off her kindle. She gets all flustered. I say, “Oh man, you are so busted.” She laughs.

As the plane takes off we start to talk. We start to get more personal. She tells me her boyfriend of one year just dumped her a few weeks ago. I ask a few questions but then change the subject. We keep talking and talking. 

About a half hour later she asks what my name is. 

**The Conversation Gets Sexual**

I’m not as sexual with this girl as I usually am with most girls I start talking to. I’m making friendly conversation, telling some stories, but I’m not really trying much. I actually don’t give a shit at first whether we’re gonna be friends or something else. 

But then I start testing the waters because this girl is really, really cute. I’m throwing out some flirty comments here and there. 

Eventually, I go into [the questions game](http://approachanxiety.com/2010/09/instant-sexual-vibe-on-your-first-date/). I swear to god, I think that’s the best escalation move ever. It’s even better than physical escalation because it revs up her imagination.

I start with non-sexual questions. What would you be if you knew you couldn’t fail? Boring stuff. 

Then it gets more sexual. 

I ask her about her first kiss. Then the craziest place she ever had sex. We’re exchanging sexual stories.

I let my hand drop on the seat in between us so that it’s touching her outer thigh.

She asks me what my sexual fantasy is. I tell her we’re at a beach party with a bonfire, on a comfy chair under some blankets. We’re fooling around but she can’t make a noise because everyone will know. So she has to be quiet and look normal while I start to fuck her under the blanket. I can tell this is turning her on.

The dude next to her is asleep with his headphones on. 

Eventually, I ask her how good a kisser she is. She says a 9. And then changes it to an 8.

Huh, I say.

Then I ask, “Does this bother you?” as I put my hand on her knee. (This sequence is a Brad P move)

She says no.

I say, “What about this?” and slowly scrape my nails on the inside of her jeans closer to her crotch. 

She says no.

**Making Out Starts**

There is so much sexual energy, it's insane. I'm so turned on, and so is she. It’s time to make the move. 

I turn and move my head closer to hers. She moves her head toward me. We start making out. We’re all over each other. We stop every once in a while to see if anyone is looking, but then start making out again. 

Her coat is covering her lap. I’m playing Russian hands and Roman fingers under her coat. She’s getting turned on like crazy. Soon my hands are in her pants and I’m fingering her. She’s lets out a muted moan every time I stick my finger deeper inside her.

Finally we talk about going to the bathroom to fuck. We decide to go check out the situation. We wake up the asian guy and he gets up to let us out into the aisle. We probably look guilty as hell. I couldn’t care less, I am so turned on right now.

But there’s no way we’re gonna get into the bathroom together. There’s stewardesses right by the doors and they make the next person in line wait four rows back before the bathroom is free.

**Time to Reel it Back In**

We each use the restroom separately and go back to our seats. At this point, there’s two hours left in our four hour flight. I have to put the brakes on. What are we gonna do, tease each other for the rest of the flight? Fuck on the seats? Not gonna happen.

I playfully tell her she needs to calm down and get control of herself. This doesn’t stop us from fooling around some more. But eventually I grow tired of this. There’s only so much you can do without fucking.

So we end up playing scrabble on her Kindle fire for the rest of the flight. It’s pretty chill. I make up a rule that we need to come up with a dirty sentence for each scrabble word we spell. I’m talking dirty to her the whole time, spelling words like, ‘beg’ and saying, “I’m gonna make you beg like the naughty girl you are.”

The plane eventually touches down. Both of us are tired and drained. Not a whole lot to say but we talk here and there as we walk through the terminal together. I tell her we should meet up while I’m in town. She says let’s hang out on Thursday. We exchange numbers. I leave her at the baggage claim and take off to meet up with my friend who is picking me up.

**edit:** I posted this here right before going to college and had no time to write why I think it's so important, so now, here it is... 

When I first started practicing the game about a year ago I was always very worried about knowing all the gambits, all the lines, read everything and know how to react to every situation possible. 

Sometime in the game and a lot of girls after that, my mindset changed a lot and I started living and approaching with much more confidence and without worries. And the results really impressed me. 

I think that women nowadays really miss the real men, the unapologetic guys that have no shame in wanting them and, like Mark Manson says in the sentence above, the man who is bold and willing to make a move.

Of course that this is not enough to pick up every beautiful girl in the world. You have to know how to escalate, be an interesting guy and blahblah. But this is for sure one of the best lessons about seduction.

1342980212.0,436,self.seduction,wz2nf,"Conversational Threading: Never run out of things to say, EVER",551,115,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wz2nf/conversational_threading_never_run_out_of_things/,"**What is it?**

Conversation Threading is essentially the ability to make a free-flowing conversation. If someone gives you a thread like ""I went to Paris last summer to Study at the local university,"" you have many, many directions you could thread the conversation. You could ask if they liked Paris, which school they went to, what they study, or you could shift the focus of the conversation, you could respond with ""Really? I went to Paris last year,"" or ""I like to travel, as well""  [Which is a great way to build rapport through shared experiences!]

Even if she's giving you tiny bits of information, you can still thread the conversation. ""I'm going to class,""  obviously you can ask her about, you could shift the focus again [Me too, I'm taking (subject), isn't it *fascinating* how...], you could drop a cold-read, you could pace her hypnotically [Have you ever noticed how we're both here, outside this coffee shop, having this conversation and blah blah blah] you could go into any direction.    **BE CREATIVE.** and don't be afraid to be different. Mix the expected with the unexpected. 

**Now lets go deeper**

You can combine the technique I just gave you with other techniques. In particular, you can go from cold conversation [logical factoids, I'm a lawyer, gas is too expensive] to warm conversation [Feelings, emotions. Things ""from us"" rather than about us].

What if she tells you she is an emergency room nurse? Well, you could continue logically probing about it, *or* you could discuss emotions. What emotions are involved in nursing? ""*You must feel amazing* knowing that what you're doing is helping people,""  is an example that comes to mind, I'm trusting you to come up with your own.

*It is my personal opinion to avoid ""negative"" emotions, obviously you aren't going to talk about patients dying in her arms, but I also try to avoid stress, panic, and the like. Sometimes I see people, who mean well, ask people ""Wow that must be so busy,"" or ""You must feel really stressed,"" and the person they're talking to sigh, slouch and begin to talk about all the hardships of their work. These are not emotions I want associated with our initial conversations.* **Feel free to combine this with the techniques you learned in the books; hot words and so on.**

**Wide Rapport**

So now you're having an interesting conversation that's enticing the emotions. Here's some advice:  Talk about a wide range of topics. At first glance, one might think it's better to talk about one subject, and be in total agreement for an hour, than to talk about a wide range of topics, but actually a ""wide rapport"" will help you. Thread into multiple directions, talk about multiple topics, and you both will feel like you've connected on multiple levels.  

**How to Master Conversation Threading**

Here's some homework, it involves making ""mind maps"" (also called spider diagrams, trees, or whatever the fuck you want).  Pick something girls say that you hear often, if you meet a lot of girls that are Psychologists, write ""Psychologist"" in the center of a paper, and circle it.

Then branch it out. Draw a line to smaller circle, label it emotions. What emotions do Psychologists have in their work? ""Isn't it amazing how sometimes, *you feel such an amazing connection* with the people you see?"" 

What emotional qualities must a psychologist have?

From the center circle labled Psychologist, branch out into other directions.  Make a bubble that says ""Values,""  what character traits must Pscyhologists have? What values do they have?    [You must consider yourself a very caring person, correct?]

Of course, you can draw branches for the other aspects of their job. You can write a bubble that says ""College Education"" and branch off from there. You can draw a bubble that says ""Job description"" and branch off from there.

This will help you in your sarges, instead of a tepid ""I'm a psychologist,""  ""Oh do you like your work?"" you could make it more interesting,  and branch it out into many different directions.

**And remember**

There is no wrong response. If you say something like ""You're a psychologist? They say to be a psychologist *you must deeply care for people.*"" and she says ""Oh, yeah but I don't really interact with the patients I just do the record keeping,""  work with whatever response she gives you. Everything she says is something you can thread with!",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_wz2nf,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wz2nf/conversational_threading_never_run_out_of_things/,
1363989646.0,435,self.seduction,1atqhi,A girl went thermonuclear AFC on ME,553,118,201,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1atqhi/a_girl_went_thermonuclear_afc_on_me/,"This is a new one for me.  I thought some of you guys might find it interesting.  If nothing else this experience gave me a glimpse into what it's like to be a girl who has AFC's hitting on her and how that would color her response and receptiveness to any new person approaching her.  On to the story. 

About a month ago I started frequenting a bar on my way home from work.  I like the bartender and the vibe is really laid back.  I'd estimate I've stopped in about 3 times a week for the last month.  I realized pretty quickly who the regulars were and ended up becoming friends/acquaintances with several of them.  It's a diverse crowd. They span from 60 year old men to 21 year old girls.  In keeping with the whole idea of self improvement I made an effort to talk to everyone.  In the past I might have just talked to certain people who I thought were in my age range and generally my type.  By talking to everyone and essentially treating them all the same, I found myself and my conversation to be more relaxed, natural, and fun.  There was no effort involved.  I was having fun and by extension became a fun person to be around.  

Several of the girls I met there became flirty with me at one point or another.  Depending on my mood sometimes I'd flirt back and other times I wouldn't.  Like I said I was mostly just enjoying the dynamic I described above and didn't have any strong interest in any of these girls.  It was just a fun place to unwind after work.

One day one of these girls (Let's call her K) was there with her friend.  She introduced me and we hung out for a few hours.  They said they were going to a bar down the street and asked me to come along.  I told them I should probably go home but they insisted so I went.  When we get there K completely ignores her friend and just talks to me to the point that it felt awkward. K is very flirty and makes a couple of pointed comments and sexual jokes.  I didn't respond to or reciprocate any of it.  I liked hanging out with her but I wasn't interested in her.  I figured she'd get the clue. I finished my drink and said goodnight.  

The next week I'm back at the after work bar.  K is there among many other regulars and general clientele.  We say hi and chat.  I tell her I'm heading out soon and she says she is too.  She's going to meet her friend at the other bar just like last week.  She asks me to come.  I could use one more drink so I go.  On the walk over she tells me I must not be too smart because I'm not picking up on the fact that she's been hitting on me.  I tell her I have picked up on it but that I'm seeing someone.  She seems cool with it.

We get to the next bar and have a drink with her friend.  I'm talking to her friend and K is sitting with her arms crossed, looking at the floor, and pouting.  I ask her if she doesn't like my conversation.  She says ""no, but I don't like what you said earlier.""  I said you mean that I'm seeing someone? Are you kidding? At this point she started ranting the most insane shit I've ever heard.  She starts calling me an asshole and says ""if that was the case you should have shut me down the second I started talking to you.""  She looks at her friend and says ""he knew I liked him.  why would he do this to me?""  Her voice gets louder and louder until she's basically yelling.  She looks at me and says ""I think you better finish your drink and leave.""  I say I'll leave when I'm ready.  ""No. Get the fuck out now!  Get the fuck out!!!!""  When she realizes I'm not leaving she storms off and leaves her friend there.  It was like she turned into a completely different person the second I told her I was seeing someone. 


I'm basically in shock.  I end up having a good conversation with her friend until about a half hour later when K comes back.  I thought she might have had the chance to calm down and was going to apologize.  Nope.  She looks at her friend and says ""What the fuck is he still doing here?""  I tell her I honestly don't understand why she's so upset.  Again she looks at her friend and says ""is he serious?  HE FOLLOWS ME TO BARS and now he won't leave?  he's crazy!!!""  Her friend was visibly embarrassed.  At this point I had enough and left.  

I left feeling really pissed off.  Not because of the rant itself but because I felt like for a month I had been interacting with people from a grounded, natural, outcome independent place and in return I get screamed at by someone who is completely outcome dependent and is only interacting with me because they want something.

1343206567.0,435,self.seduction,x4gb9,[FR] Lorded the wedding reception; threesome F-close with the bridesmaids.,588,153,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x4gb9/fr_lorded_the_wedding_reception_threesome_fclose/,"I had an incredible weekend.  It took a few days of recovery and reflection to really get back into the regular pace of things, and I'm here now with a field report for your edification.

I'll focus on the key details, and provide **a summary in bold at the end of each major section**.

*Setting: My cousin's wedding ceremony and reception at a local vineyard and winery.*

I hadn't seen this cousin of mine in years, but I reconnected with her via Facebook.  She invites me to her wedding so that we can catch up.  Also present were many other female cousins I hadn't seen in a very long time.

At the wedding, I made it a point to talk to everyone I could.  Just because everyone at the wedding knows the bride and groom doesn't mean that everyone knows each other.  I took this as an opportunity to bridge groups and get everyone socializing.  It really helped with warming the party up and getting everyone comfortable and talkative, including myself.  **Do plenty of practice sets to get yourself into a talkative mood.**

Cue HB Tulip Tattoo and HB Wavy Blonde.  Tulip and Blonde were two lovely bridesmaids who appeared to be close friends, and I mentioned that.  When my cousin the bride introduced me she heaped on the praise and displays of affection, which got Tulip and Blonde smiling big.  There was my in.

I waste no time in initiating kino.  Tulip is wearing a halter top dress so her tattoo is clearly visible.  I kino her by lightly clasping her shoulder and turning her around so I can see the rest of it.  I make a crack about her obvious love for pain and the two girls giggle up a storm.  I kino Blonde simply by walking in a circle around her and drawing a line around her shoulders with my finger as I talk.  I keep her mind baffled with my words and movement, and her body entranced with the sensation of the contact.

I move the girls around the party, pulling their hands, urging at the smalls of their backs.  **Touch early, and touch with purpose.  Always be escalating your kino and assume she is comfortable with it.  If you're comfortable, she's comfortable.**

I bust on the girls, telling them they remind me of these cute girls from my old elementary school who used to stalk me on the playground trying to come up with a plot to kiss me. I tell them they're creepy with a shit-eating grin, and they're eating it up. **Always maintain the possibility of sex; plant that seed in their minds, and they won't be able to stop thinking about it.**

I end up getting pulled away from them for various reasons throughout the night -- someone wants to introduce me to someone else, or a family member wants me to help settle a dispute before it blows up and hurts the wedding, etc.  But no matter how many times I get pulled away, one girl or the other finds her way back to me.  I'm attentive and present when I have the time, but there are other things going on that occasionally demand my attention.  **Women are not the most important things in your life. Do what you need to do, and let them enjoy your company when you have the time to spare.**

*HOW THE THREESOME HAPPENED*

When the wedding is done, my cousin the bride asks if I wouldn't mind helping her and her entourage with bringing some things back to their hotel.  I oblige and play the role of protector for the bridesmaid girls as we scurry about getting things packed away.  I keep the mood light-hearted and playful as we work, and I never stop kinoing.

Some of the stuff belongs to Tulip and Blonde, which gives me cause to enter their hotel room.  I make sure their stuff leaves the van last so there's nothing stopping us from staying in the room when we're done.

Here's the important thing: these girls knew and trusted each other already, which is an important element in getting two girls to come together.

Tulip is rubbing her shoulder as we bring the last of the stuff in, so immediately I order her to come over and sit down by me on the bed (**take charge, and speak with authority**).  She complies, and I begin rubbing her shoulders.  Blonde is trying to hide her smile and pretend to look busy, but I invite her over to help me.  I tell her to rub Tulip's hands, and I give her instructions on how to do it (**be the source of information**).  ""Listen to the sound she makes while you massage,"" I say. ""If it sounds like she's home alone with her favourite toy, then you're at the right spot.""  Blonde's face goes completely red, and Tulip is giggling.  Keep the sexual tension present during the massage.  Let it escalate with each step.

I begin working under Tulip's shirt so I can get the muscles properly.  She's not resisting.

Eventually, I get the sense that Blonde is feeling a little uneasy.  Probably lack of direct kino.  I tell Blonde to continue working on Tulip while I begin working on her, since she's been a good helper (**continue kino and reward girls for compliance**).  Then, while I'm working on Blonde, Tulip turns and begins working on Blonde as well.  Blonde is lying on her stomach with Tulip and I working on her, and she's stroking my leg in gratitude.  Tulip and I are leaning into each other and rubbing Blonde's lower back, and we kiss.  Our massage becomes just a little slower, and we focus on the kissing.  Suddenly, Tulip moans during a kiss, and it's on.  Blonde flips over and pulls us down on top of her.

Hope you like it!*

Went out to a nightclub with my buddy Charlie.  Good nightclub, fun and high energy, great music, and they play the music at a volume that still leaves it possible to have actual conversations if you can project your voice decently.

Char and I are walking around, he sees a group of girls walking towards us and starts waving frantically at them with a big grin on his face (picture a little kid waving, he keeps his arm straight out, palm at 90 degrees, and waves at rapid speed.  He DOES NOT STOP until she smiles or…smiles).

The girl Charlie was making eye contact with smiles and waves back.  She pauses in her walking about two feet from Charlie and Charlie immediately gives her a big bear hug.

They start talking, I look over at her friend.  She’s Italian, with tan skin and a killer body that is just my type.  Hurray!

**Me:** Do you dance?

**Her:** What?

**Me:** Come here.

I reach out and grab her hand, spin her once, then spin myself so that I’m facing away from her and holding her hands against my body while grinding my butt into her.

[**Breakdown**: I do this for two reasons.  First, it’s a funny role reversal because girls always dance like that on guys, so it makes her laugh and cuts the “oh this is just another guy hitting on me” mindset away a bit because it’s just different / unusual.  Second, if you have a fit body, it gets her groping you in a way that isn’t overtly showy but she will definitely take note of it and can even get turned on by it.]

Then I spin out, do a few swing dance moves I know, dip her, and now she’s laughing and smiling.

**Me:** You’re a TERRIBLE dancer!!  [said with a big grin on my face]

**Her:** It’s not my fault!  I have giant heels on right now.

**Me:** Oh I see, it’s all the shoes fault.

(Out of the blue, I squat down and wrap my arms around her waist, and pick her up so she’s a foot off the ground).

**Me:** I’ll just do all the work for both of us then!  I’ll dance for me and I’ll pick you up and dance for you, and you can just do nothing!  Worst dancer ever!

[**Breakdown**: Here I start teasing her by calling her a terrible dancer.  If you spend an entire interaction being nothing but complimentary, you can risk coming off as a sycophant or a “nice guy” (not sexy).  Teasing makes the interaction playful and shows her I’m not so in awe of her looks that I can’t give her a hard time.  Picking her up creates a rush a sudden fun, positive emotion and also gets us touching each other more]

I put her down, she puts her hands around my neck and says something and then lets her hands fall away.  As she does this I realize her hands smell like smoke.  I take her hand and bring it to my face.

**Me**: Have you been smoking??

**Her**: Wow, you are good.

**Me**: Oh my god, I can’t believe this, have you been drinking too?!?

**Her**: Umm, yes?

**Me**: [putting my hands on her shoulders in mock indignation]  What about our baby!  I can’t believe you would do this to our child!  That’s it, I can’t take this any more, you are dumped, I want a divorce!

**Her**: haha

**Me**: You can keep my stuff, I don’t even want it back, I just can’t believe you

At this point I throw my one arm around her shoulders and turn to talk to Charlie and the other two girls.

[**Breakdown**:Again I’m pushing her away verbally and being affectionate physically, sending mixed signals but being playful about it the whole time (not actually being mean or angry)]

**Girl #3 who hasn’t been talking to Charlie or I**: Wait so how do you know these guys?

**Me**: [Italian] is my ex-wife

Talk for a minute, then I randomly and quickly pick up [Italian] wedding style, do a quick dip so her feet are above her head, she starts laughing, and then I put her down facing me with her back to the group, and my arms are around her waist.

We’re looking at each other, no words exchanged, I lean in for the kiss and she immediately meets me halfway.

[**Breakdown**: This all happened in just a few minutes.  The kiss was there because there was no physical barrier between us.  I had already spun her, she’d had her hands on my body, I had picked her up physically twice, I had my arms around her.  At this point we were so close physically, even while talking our faces were inches apart, and the kiss was an easy transition.  [Touching early and often, and outlandishly in over the top ways at times, makes the kiss into a small event.](http://www.kickassacademy.com/how-to-kiss-a-girl-for-the-first-time/) ]

**How we end up leaving together:** I start pulling her hair and pushing things forward physically.  I’m alternating between dirty talk (saying I can tell she’s a freak in bed, describing what I’d like to do to her, etc.) and telling her she can’t come home with me because I have work the next day.

After a bit of this I’m super turned on and I know she is too, so I grab her hand, say “we need to get out of here right now”, and start walking towards the exit.  She says she has to say goodbye to her friends, runs back to tell them she’s leaving, and we walk out to go to my apartment. 

**Endnote**: A lot of this stuff may seem like it’s all well thought out and pre-meditated, but when it’s happening real time it’s instinct.  I'm not thinking to myself ""I just pulled her verbally, so I have to push physically, and I should touch her on her lower back because it's more sensual than her shoulder"".  You can’t possibly be thinking about all of these variables at the same time (or at least I can’t, my head would explode).  I've just said / done each of these enough times that it has all become habit.  It’s the same thing that happens when someone reaches out for a handshake and you meet their hand with yours without thinking about it, because you’ve done it so many times.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1364592369.0,,,True,t3_1b9ktt,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1b9ktt/fr_boy_meets_girl_30_minutes_later_boy_and_girl/,

**EDIT FOR SOME CONTEXT:** all this was written as a suggested approach for somebody who was dared to get laid within 2 weeks. I should have stressed this more, because some of the 'stranger' advice - stressing alcohol,  the color of your shirt, taking dishonest 'shortcuts' to interesting hobbies - would be pretty screwed up if you make all this your general lifestyle. Don't. Specifically, this text is a reply to this question:

&gt;If I don't get laid by February 1st, I have allowed my roommate one unexpected groin shot. Would any other newbie like to partake in this challenge? We have 2 weekends.

TL;DR: a beginner's guide to getting laid within a short time frame, with lots of short practical tips

---
Getting laid within the course of a couple of weeks should be doable, at least if you are in your twenties, in a place with many bars and parties where lots of drunk people in their early twenties tend to go, and are reasonably good-looking (i.e. not fat, no acne, lenses rather than glasses if you, can though it's not *that* important).

Do those apply to you? Ok, let's go:

**Prep work**

* If you don't yet, shower and brush your teeth every day, and have neatly cut nails. Would be stupid to give her a reason to not find you attractive like this. Being a smoker is ok though, actually it's a plus because it makes for great socializing and isolating, but ok, no point in starting to smoke just for 2 weeks.
* Start wearing blue jeans, a shirt or polo (preferably red) and a blazer *all the time*. Lend it from a friend for the bet if you need to, hopefully they'll chuckle when hearing the reason and then cooperate. No t-shirts until february 1st. Shave, but if you have stubble, shave leave it on (i.e. shave electronically). If this is totally not your style, great, if someone asks say some random dude gave it as style advice and fuck it, you're giving it a shot for 2 weeks! This kind of 'fuck it, just having some fun, no harm in giving it a shot' attitude is what you should be having all the time the next 2 weeks, so might as well start here.
* Have fun starting conversations with random strangers everywhere, regardless of gender or age. If it feels awkward, FUCK IT WHATEVER, YOU'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME FOR THE BET. Read stuff like [this](http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2009/05/seven-tips-for-making-good-conversation-with-a-stranger/) if you need inspiration. Ok, sorry, that link sucks, talk about *light-hearted* stuff first and foremost.
* If you play guitar, great, work that into conversations. If not, watch 2 guitar tutorials on Youtube, and get used to it: you are now officially 'learning guitar'. Borrow a guitar from a friend for 2 weeks for bonus points. 
* Same goes for 'travel' and 'being international': recall your last greatest travels, and practice in your head to transform some of those travel memories into 'fun stories'. If you speak another language (preferably Spanish or French), great, if not, read some language learning sites on it and get used to it you are now officially 'learning proper French/Spanish because you love travel and connecting with the locals makes it so much better'.
* Have scented candles and some bottles of red wine (however cheap) stashed at your place. When you get a girl home, it's fun to jokingly create a 'romantic-ish' atmosphere, even if you both already know you're there for sex (because you started making out on the way home, see below). Red wine is great because it tastes good after both a night of drinking beer, wine, or cocktails.
* Go buy condoms and make sure to have them somewhere near your bed. If you are inexperienced in sex, practice putting on condoms. Seriously, nothing kills the mood like not being able to do this quickly even while drunk and in the darkness, and it's not an easy task. *Especially* because ideally you put it on while you are kissing her to keep her in the mood.

Ok, now that you are a social, nicely dressing and interesting enough guy for a drunk girl to potentially want to have sex with, and you are prepared for the logistics, we'll have you going on 2 fronts to meet those girls: during the day, classes etc etc... and on dead moments, you want to be on okcupid. During the evening, you want to be out getting drunk together with other people. In the late afternoon, you send out texts and call girls you met before.

**Dating site**

Do all of this RIGHT NOW after reading my comment.

* Create a girl profile on okcupid.com, surf around to some guy profiles, and when you find one that seems nice and makes you smile and is not too long, create a guy profile, copy it, and change whatever needed to make it apply to you. For your profile picture, you want your face turned 3/4 (jawline!), and smiling. For your 'secondary' pictures, you want either pictures where you have fun with friends, travel pictures, or pictures were you are wearing some kind of gimmicky clothing (dressed like a banana or whatever).
* Start answering okcupid.com questions to kill time, change little things, etc... Add FUNNY COMMENTS to those questions, they will make you appear in people's news feeds.
* Still to kill time, start shooting off random, short messages based to girls' profiles. MAXIMUM 2 PHRASES, something funny, something with a smiley, AND NO QUESTION.
* If they answer (and they surprisingly often will, people just don't realize the above is how you do it), propose dating right away. Make your first phrase a reaction to her message, and the second *But, how about we skip the okcupid message ping pong and meet up? Hell, how about this weekend even for all I care, I've been looking to check out this place zzz.

Anyway, my name is xxx, nice to meet you ;) (my phone number is xxx, perhaps you can get me yours? More practical to arrange things that way)*

Ok, that should get you covered on the online dating front, with some luck you can get 1 or 2 dates out of this. On those dates:

* Have a bottle of red wine at your place
* Go to a nice pub that's not to silent and not to loud, and cheerily start the drinking. If you don't know what to talk about, mention the guitar and/or travel.
* The 'interacting with the girls' bit from below very much applies on dates also.
* After an hour or 3 drinks, whichever comes first, propose to move to another place and do it! Chose a place walking distance from your place, that is WORSE than the first one! While there, proceed to drinking, teasing and touching and the 'end game' (see below).

**Nightlife**

Ok, now for the nights: you will be drinking alcohol every evening for the next 2 weeks, because I told you so.

* Do you drink a lot? No? Sorry, that bad habit you will have to lose until the 1st. Go out a LOT, go to places where there's alcohol and people are loose and social, and join them in the drinking, laughing, and of course, talking to, and joking around with, random people all the time. You want to be drinking with somebody at least 5 times per week from now on. Going out together with a group of friends is ok, going to a party at somebody's house is better, but if you don't have anybody GO TO A CONCERT SOMEWHERE ON YOUR OWN. Build resistance, so that you can still laugh and stand on your feet while you are in an environment full of piss-drunk people, and of course, keep practicing the being social with girls.

**Interacting with the girls**

Ok, now on to conversations with girls you meet, either during the day or at those drunk parties parties, or after a while in the online tdate or WHEREVER, do the following things EARLY and OFTEN, constantly reminding yourself that you should be doing them or moving towards doing them:

* **Be separate from the group**: stand so that it's just you 2, say 'let's go get drinks'... Just don't be standing in some kind of circle with a girl, that's lame.
* **Tease her**: when she says something slightly silly say 'ok. You're drunk, time to go home.' or, well, whatever you can come up with to jokingly make fun of her. You want to aim for her playfully hitting your shoulder and her jaw dropping in shock (but with a smile in her eyes) as soon as possible.
* **touch her**: shake hands or give a kiss on the check while touching her upper arm when first introduced, or example, during the above tease, put your hand on her shoulder and look her deep in the eyes while speaking with a playfully stern voice. When moving trough a crowd together, grab her hand. Or gently guide her by her waist. Stuff like that.
* **Be interesting**: talk about your guitar, and about recent and future travel trips, and ask her about stuff she loves and listen to that too.

Don't be scared if you are not 'a natural', just constantly consciously remind yourself of these things. It's ok, people won't notice if you feel 'unnatural' even if you think they do.

**Closing it up**

KEEP GETTING HER DRINKS (or saying it's your turn or whatever) TROUGHOUT ALL THIS. Don't be a cheapo, all of this is only for 2 weeks. But of course, don't start offering any drinks before you are engaged in friendly banter either, that's putting her on a pedestal and she'll think you're a loser. But while you are in a friendly conversation, getting drinks for the both of you is NOT a bad thing, contrary what you hear here. Also, even if you gave the previous 'round', don't be scared to also offer the next! If this is during a nice date or chat and she is cool, 99% of the cases she will say 'oh yes, but it's my turn, I'll go get them'. 

If you are with a girl doesn't like to drink alcohol, try hard to convince her anyway (teasing her), and if that doesn't work, MOVE ON. She is the type that doesn't like to 'let go', and it's very likely she won't like to have sex with people after only one date / right after meeting, either. Not good for your sex-by-february plan.

(unless she does not drink, but *does* do other drugs, that's a good indicator as well for a 'letting go' personality of course)

At this point a warning: I emphasize drinking so much for your get-laid-soon plan, because it gets people loose and light-headed and adventurous, that's what we are doing here - you do NOT want to get her to the point where she can barely stand on her feet and talk anymore (but *very* drunk if she's an experienced drinker is no problem), because sex with a girl like that is NO FUN if not impossible, and, frankly, it's also rape. Don't do that. 

Anyway, you've told her about the wine at your place and cheerily proposed you go there, and she's coming along. If you haven't yet, wondering **where/when to kiss her**, right? The answer is, either at the party/date if you manage to get both of you a bit 'isolated', but if that fails *while walking back to your place*. While walking, playfully extern your arm so she can hold it in a 'lady' manner (and of course, be touching and get close to you and appreciate your 'joking gentleman' style), keep talking with her all the time while walking, but at one point when you're both really laughing hard at something, stop, gently pull her against some wall, and slowly and softly kiss her. 

Then, just stop quite abruptly and keep walking and talking about whatever you were talking about. If she kissed you back, feel free to repeat this process several times troughout the walk, but this time have *her* on the side of the wall, and rub all over her back and side while kissing. Pinning her against the wall like that is kinda 'dominant' which tends to turn girls on. More advanced but even more turn-on is to hold her wrists while kissing, and/or putting them over her head. But ok, that's nice but not needed, as long as you kiss her before you get to your place. Having er at your place and *then* kissing sucks, because if she doesn't kiss you back it's extremely awkward and you'll be far more devastated when she leaves.

**At your place**

At your place, the only thing left to do at this point is *don't screw up*. Put on music, and don't talk much, except for short quips in between the kissing, or if you are really good at light-hearted jokingly talking (and you should be, if only from talking to all those strangers all the time), open that bottle of wine and poor drinks, but make sure to not forget to get back to the making out. 

When making out / kissing: be soft, gentle and slow, *lots* of kissing and touching her with her clothes on before you remove the first thing, etc etc... In short, keep moving forward, but be prepared to do it SLOWLY, even taking one step back if she protests, but always keeping the touching and kissing going. If she wants to take things fast you'll notice, no worries. **The secret to being a good kisser** is to do it like the movies by the way: don't shove your tongue in there and start twirling it around - and you WILL be inclined to do it like that when drunk - but rather go in slow, soft, 3 second kisses with your tongue just barely inside her, and then pulling back and going in again. Have a look at [Sarah Michelle Gellar teaching it to Selma Blair](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flIZrXdKQlQ), that's what I am talking about.

In case you wonder, **the way to go from 'making out on the couch with our clothes on' to 'she is dripping wet and wants to tear my clothes off'** is to *rub her strongly between her legs, including full on crotch, over her clothes*. Doing it just over her  panties if she wears a skirt is the best scenario, but even if she wears jeans this works wonders on just about every girl, it's really quite shocking to notice the first time you get to do this. Clits are a wonderful invention, and, praise yourself lucky, we live in times where every guy can find out EXACTLY where it is from watching online porn. Believe me, there was a time this was different, guys not knowing where it is was a common joke between girls, and guys naturally were terrible at sex their first few times (or entire lives!) because of not figuring this out they figured this one out. But there's not excuse anymore nowadays.

If you are eventually about to have sex and putting on a condom and struggling with it, don't get nervous, just jokingly say 'man, condoms really hate me' or something and keep trying, including trying with a new one if you put yours on inside-out accidentally.

Unfortunately you didn't choose the ideal moment for your bet, spring/summer are a lot easier to get girls (people are cheerier, more outgoing, more willing to have parties and adventures etc...). 

Ok, that's the best I can come up with I think, and notice how I'm not using any of the 'pua lingo' because there's enough to remember already without that ;) Good luck!",Comprehensive,False,,t5_2qhrv,1358415674.0,,,True,t3_16oxjo,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16oxjo/by_request_how_to_get_laid/,

The answer in the first case could be: ""Wow, my mind just went totally blank. You need to say something now or this will get awkward fast."" In the second case, it could be ""I wanted to say hi to you before I got too nervous to talk to you at all, but that's as far as I planned ahead. Shit.""

I called this ""embrace the truth"", which I really mean, but I realize there's a larger point that is maybe swept under the rug by a lot of intermediate guys but accepted as gospel by the truly advanced guys.

Embarrassment, shame, fear, self-consciousness... these are INTRINSIC HUMAN EMOTIONS. If you do not have them, you are a sociopath. If someone tells you they don't have them, they are almost certainly a liar, and if not, they are almost certainly a sociopath themselves.

You've heard it in all the war movies, when an older officer is inspiring a private. ""We're all scared,"" he might say, ""bravery is about what you do when you're scared, not when you don't have any fear.""

The difference between a man who can successfully ""not give a fuck"" and one who lives in fear of approaching women is that the latter guy isn't just embarrassed or afraid... he is embarrassed and afraid to be embarrassed and afraid. ""Not giving a fuck"" is about recognizing and accepting how ridiculous you are; that you're this goofy creature who does stupid things.

Those asshole PUAs with their greasy slicked back hair, lava lamps, and water beds? The ones relishing in getting any woman at any point? Those guys are pretending they're not feeling what you're feeling because they're just as terrified as you are to feel embarrassed, but they've learned to hide it.

Those great guys who everybody likes, treat people well, and have women flock to them? The so called ""naturals""? They get just as embarrassed but they don't freak out about it. What makes them ""natural"" is that they act natural... and being a little afraid to be rejected by a girl, or running out of things to say, or stammering and being a goof is a perfectly natural thing to happen.

Being ""alpha"" is about accepting this kind of stuff happens, and you're just a human being like everyone else. If you really think any of these mythical heros of yours are perfect - Clooney or Pitt or whoever you consider the ladies man of choice to be - you've let yourself be convinced of something that isn't true by imperfect information. Everyone has a vested interest in presenting themselves a certain way, and your own head is the only head you actually get to exist inside. But I promise you, everyone else walking around - ladies man or lady - is just as much a bizarrely evolved super-ape as you are. In their heads, the same shit is going on to a lesser or greater extent.

In order to successfully ""not give a fuck"", you need to stop being so hard on yourself. You knew that already. But what that means is to stop being embarrassed to be embarrassed. Just let yourself be self-deprecating or silly, and don't worry if other people see that you aren't perfect. If they judge you for it, that makes them the fool, not you.

Any situation that a ""loser"" finds themselves in can be turned into a ""win"" by just demonstrating that being thought of as a loser is irrelevant to your sense of self-value.

Your overall point is dead on, but guys, be careful with this line. There are two types of self-deprecation. Insecure guys tend to use it preemptively to protect their ego by either lowering expectations or avoiding ""risky"" situations altogether. This not attractive at all.

Secure guys will use it retroactively; they'll look back on a mistake they've made and revel in the humor of it just as they would if it was someone else's mistake.

That's way more than I was expecting! Haha some poor guy won't know what hit him this weekend when suddenly the barmaid's trying all these out every time a woman comes near him!



It's not the most pressing of issues, but it's just a little thing I've been thinking about recently that seddit might be able to give me some feedback on. 


I've been working as a barmaid since November, and over the months I've got to know a lot of the regular customers. There are a few groups of guys who come in who I've grown to like a lot - they're always sweet and polite and joke around with me when I'm not busy.


From my position behind the bar I like to people watch, and week after week I see these groups of guys trying their luck with the pretty girls that walk in. Sometimes they'll be successful, sometimes less so, and with the guys I like I try and give them a little helping hand.



If a pretty girl comes up to the bar I'll strike up conversation with her as I'm getting her drink, compliment her hair or whatever (drunk girls are easy to befriend, they're very affectionate and enthusiastic.) If one of the guys comes up to the bar while she's there, I'll greet him like he's the coolest guy in the whole room, start a little banter with him and let him look like the funny guy who the staff all love. I'll ask the girl ""oh, have you met David..?"" and make some introductions that David can develop into a conversation. It's an easy little opener that gives him a way to talk to her and it's worked a few times, but I feel like I could be doing something a bit more subtle and creative!



I've debated sending drinks over to pretty girls in the past and saying ""that's from the guy in the blue"" but I know a lot of guys think buying girls drinks is a bad move!


I know a lot of you guys would probably prefer doing all the work yourself, but a lot of these guys probably haven't even heard of PUAs (although some of them have pretty good natural game!) Little games like this keep me entertained during a boring night in work, and happy guys who've just picked up a cute girl tend to tip better too :)

The problem is that mystery isn’t the right quality to be building. Guys will hear they’re supposed to be mysterious and immediately they begin withholding every bit of information about themselves. They don’t give their real names, they make up obviously fake jobs, and they seemingly vanish into the aether when they leave the venue.

If done extremely well, this can work. But what doesn’t work when done extremely well? What you want is a plan that works when you’re just reasonably competent, and what happens when you have reasonably competent mysteriousness? You seem evasive, like you have something to hide. And since this isn’t a court of law, your silence can be interpreted as evidence against you. Not to mention you can become very annoying very quickly. It’s a bit like trying to have a conversation with someone who answers every question with a question — not really a turn on.

What you should be trying to cultivate rather than mystery is intrigue. The difference is that mystery is about never letting her see behind the curtain, while intrigue is about inch by inch very slowly pulling the curtain back. Mystery says not to reveal, while intrigue says to reveal but be smart about it.

There’s a saying that the sexiest part of a woman’s body is whatever part it kept just out of view. It’s the next inch above the bottom of a skirt, no matter how long the skirt is. Purveyors of pornography figured this out long ago. That’s why porn doesn’t start with a naked woman, it starts with one who is clothed and who removes her clothing piece by piece. And of course before that lesson they also learned that eventually you’ve got to show the naked lady, she can’t remain a fully clothed mystery forever.

**Move Slowly**

For many recovering average frustrated chumps, the instinct is to bombard a girl with all of your best qualities as soon as you can. If you don’t, you run the risk of her rejecting you before you’ve finished making your case. That’s just fear and self doubt talking. If she’s already lost interest, telling her you aced the SAT isn’t going to suddenly get her back. But if she is interested, laying all your cards on the table makes the rest of your interactions dull. Part of what makes relationships fun is the exploration, and yanking the curtain wide open puts an immediate end to that.

Hold some cards back. If you’re an excellent cook, resist the urge to invite her over for dinner at your place for a second date.

You also want to speak less. I don’t mean during the approach or when you’ve only been in set for a couple minutes. At that point you really do have to carry the conversation. I mean later on in the interaction, don’t feel like you need to fill up every moment with spoken noise. Make eye contact, kino, and give her the mental space necessary to wonder what you’re thinking.

**Be Surprising**

If you keep going on the same kinds of dates over and over, even if she’s enjoying them, things will become stale and boring. If you normally go out for drinks or just hang out at your place, invite her to go hiking, or go to the zoo, or to Color Me Mine and paint coffee mugs. Not only is it just fun to have a change of pace, but she’ll realize that there’s a whole other side to you that she didn’t know about before. She’ll want to explore that territory. She’ll also begin to feel excitement as she anticipates what the next surprise will be. That’s free intrigue right there! You haven’t even done the next surprising thing yet.

This is also why you have to hold some cards back. If you use all your good moves up front then you don’t have any moves left.

**Have Something Behind The Curtain Worth Revealing**

This is the tough part. It’s easy to build suspense and keep her on her toes, but at the end of the day there’s gotta be something back there. If you’ve been going to movies and out for drinks and playing Scrabble in cafes and then invite her over for a dinner you’re going to cook that will surprise and intrigue her. But the intrigue will end when she realizes you’re a mediocre cook. If you cook something unique and delicious though, now you’ve built more interest, she wants to know how you got to be such a good cook and what else you’re capable of doing.

So what can you do to put some good stuff behind the curtain? All the obvious things you’d think of if you tried to answer the question for yourself.

Read more, and something other than self help guides — read some classic novels, literary fiction, memoirs, popular science, whatever you find interesting.

Work on a creative hobby. Yeah, that means playing less video games. If you like playing guitar, really work on it, don’t be content with your current skill level. If you like cooking, start reading Cooks Country to really understand the craft better. Whatever it is, take it seriously.

Get out of the house and go do something. Go to an art museum, go to the zoo, go to a comedy show, or a concert, or a baseball game. Sitting at home watching ESPN doesn’t count. That’s not an experience. Sitting at the stadium is an experience, something you can talk about doing. Even if the girl isn’t in to baseball, she will find it interesting that you go out and experience life. That’s an increasingly rare trait these days. If you try to talk about how you sat on the couch watching the NBA finals you’re likely to bore her to sleep (with someone else).

Lastly, exercise more. You might present a mystery to medical researchers, but within the context of seduction, there’s nothing intriguing about a lifeless sack of raw dough. Someone who is in shape though? It encourages speculation about how you do it, and gives off the general impression of living an active, exciting life, even if your exercise routine is itself boring.

And that right there is really the key to building intrigue. Have something intriguing, then just fine tune your delivery.

If you found this useful, I'm working on a blog to collect all the stuff I've written on pick up: [Stop Beta Shit](http://stopbetashit.com/).",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_1gsssh,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gsssh/mystery_vs_intrigue/,
1361431073.0,427,self.seduction,18xycb,Pickup Principle: The Signal of Opportunity (with a mini FR),512,85,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/18xycb/pickup_principle_the_signal_of_opportunity_with_a/,"I read a lot of field reports here on seddit, and one thing I commonly hear guys say in the comments is that they often hesitate to escalate with women because they're not sure where they stand. I'd like to take this opportunity to bring up something which I've observed in my two or so years of practicing seduction - something which helped my pickup skills tremendously.

**Take a moment and ask yourself if you've ever been in this situation:** you meet a girl in public and open her (maybe at a bookstore or a grocery market). She smiles and doesn't say much, but she's still standing there. Maybe you're a novice and still trying to get a read on her, but she's not throwing out any obvious signals of interest - no hair flips, no nervous movements, no lip biting, nothing.

*The thing is, she's still standing there.* Maybe she looks slightly preoccupied, fiddling with whatever is in front of her. But she's there, and not putting any more or less distance between you.  That right there is a signal of interest, and it is a behaviour I've come to call the **Signal of Opportunity.**

When you're still a novice at pickup, you'll look for indicators of interest before proceeding, and I agree with this practice in the beginning. Alot of guys argue that beginners should ignore IOIs and ""assume attraction"" and I agree with this too, but I think there's a lot of value in being able to quickly read, recognize, and internalize the signals women use to communicate interest. Assuming attraction is a useful tool, but only for certain circumstances. When you're a novice, it's good to understand the social landscape.

Well, sometimes women don't gift wrap their interest in an easily recognizable present. Sometimes you have to understand, at the fundamental level, what humans are doing.

**Here's an example from my life today which illustrates this principle:**

I was out at my favourite running trail earlier this afternoon when I ran past an attractive young brunette who was standing perfectly still in the middle of the trail. I gave her an affirmative nod as I ran past - she smiled ever so slightly and quickly lowered her eyes when we made mutual eye contact. I thought nothing of it and ran on.

A quarter of a mile down the trail, I slowed to a brisk walk to catch my breath, and a few seconds later, the brunette came blazing past me, only to slow herself to a brisk walk about 10 metres in front of me. And there she remained.

Now, it doesn't seem like much, a woman just running past and slowing down. But you have to understand the subtext.

Attractive women get hit on throughout the day. A LOT. And they've develop a lot of tools for filtering guys. Bitch shields, shit testing, you know all the terms and techniques. They go out armed to the teeth and ready to keep annoying men at bay so they can enjoy their day in relative peace.

**So if a hot girl spends all of her time shooting down incoming guys who don't have the chops to survive her barrage, what does it say when she momentarily lowers her defenses in your vicinity?**

That's the Signal of Opportunity.

She's telling you that you're cleared to land, that she WANTS you to bug her so she can see what you're all about. All you've got to do is fly up and say something or, if you've already opened her, it's a signal to escalate by getting closer or initiating kino.

Remember, people are always moving towards the interesting parts of their day. Getting home to relax, heading out to grab drinks with friends, etc. So when a girl appears to be standing still longer than would seem normal, odds are there's something interesting nearby. **And odds are, that interesting something is YOU.**

Having recognized the girl's signal of opportunity, I immediately opened her. I came up to her left side and said ""Oh hell no girl, you did NOT just run past me. We're settling this right now."" She was smiling big the moment I made a sound, and she was laughing after I'd issued my challenge. We ended up racing back together, with me playfully running her off the trail a few times by crowding her space (kino escalation and negging). When we made it back to the parking lot, we made out and exchanged numbers.

**Keep it in mind, fellas. If she's not in any hurry to move away, her silence can be a good thing. Take a chance and go for it.**",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_18xycb,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/18xycb/pickup_principle_the_signal_of_opportunity_with_a/,

Everyday stoner. Told I'm good looking but I'm pretty damn awkward in uncomfortable situations. I did OK for myself female wise in university and had a few great flings, nothing crazy... A lot of chances ruined by being too needy without knowing it at all, but I still got by. But like many of you, after leaving school I got in a social rut, my party friends disappeared and there's no asking cute classmates to study anymore. I don't do sports or have super social hobbies. I only recently realized I have to really work on the social skills I'll need to be the person I want. 

Anyway, rewind to last weekend. I checked an ad for used guitars on craigslist and found one, pure impulse buy (I don't even play, yet). Meet up with the girl selling it at the mall, to my surprise she's a HB8. We make the exchange and I ease the tension and make her laugh a little. As soon as we shared eye contact and smiles (something I naturally avoid like the plague) I find we both feel comfortable and I have no problem flowing from there. She mentions she's getting rid of it since it was a gift for her ex, and she just ""can't have it around"", I make fun of her for giving up something because of one asshole. I ask if she'd be down to grab a drink, she accepts and we part ways.

We decide what to do over texting. She says she wants to go to a comedy bar. I agree even though I've heard that's a bad idea for a first date. I keep everything short other than a joke about being a craigslist guy. She wants to keep talking with smilies and haha's every text, I tell her I'm off to do something, then no more texts until confirming on the day of. I fucked this stage up so many times in the past by coming across too needy, thank you seddit for making me aware of that. Fuck texting games.

So, DATE NIGHT. I'm shitting fire all day and barely sleep the night before, going over every permutation possible of how this is going to play out. I tell myself this is good experience even if she bails, this girl is way out of my league anyway, as much as I have to pretend she isn't. I get to the bar 10 minutes earlier than we meet, and it's dead as fuck except for two deadbeet barflies and the bartender. Not my scene at all. I'm anxious as fuck. My instincts told me sit at a table and jack off on my phone until she gets there. But now knowing the importance of how comfortable I appear in the social situation, I decide to sit beside them and shoot the shit. When she walked in I happened to be making them laugh (not difficult, these guys were tanked talking about elton john songs)... she arrives I immediately go over and hug her and joke about my ""new best friends"". 

I grab her a drink, we go sit in a far corner and start talking about ourselves. There are awkward lulls, the worst part was at one point she asks me to tell a dirty joke and I had nothing. But I made a point to just smile and make eye contact during these until she laughs and looks away. Every time she looks back agian after she seems more into me. Once in awhile the barflies across the room are yelling jokes at us and giving thumbs up once in awhile, as we laugh with/at them. I give them props as I walk by to the bathroom, etc. The bartender seems to acknowledge me as the not-annoying guy. ""Talk to everybody"" is DEFINITELY solid advice.

When people start coming in, we head to a table near the stage as they set it up and continue to talk. No kino except for my knee touching hers, and prodding her hip as she walks. The host gets up eventually and acknowledges us as the ""romantic couple"" (I guess it was apparent we were vibing) and asks we move up. ""...Sure, if that will make you comfortable."" I said slightly smug as I move our stuff and lead her over. We're relentlessly the target of their ""crowd work"" in a room of ~30, prodding us to say it's our first date, etc. I even reveal we met on craigslist, when they ask how I just said ""I put up an ad for a dominatrix"" and leaned for her to spank me. Totally out of character for me but I was already riding a high, I knew she loved the attention we were getting. I was determined that I wasn't gonna let these Jonah Hill motherfuckers put me on the spot, and I somehow made it through... It was like a second set of shit tests and she saw I passed. I made a point to look at her for every joke's reaction, shared the uncomfortable moments when they were bombing, eventually she starts squeezing my knee every time she laughs or feels uncomfortable.

I ask her if she wants to take off for a walk in the cold... We walk down the street with my arm around her hip. We grab some hot chocolate and talk about the show. I'm expecting a kiss and a second date, but before all that she offers to take me home. The details don't really matter from here, a good start to the date and getting myself in the zone led the way to an unbelievable night.

tl;dr : No sex and growing anxiety for 2 years in a social rut. Go outside of comfort zone for once with a 20yo hb8 and it pays off, using various principles/concepts learned from here.

I am a fourth year student that is specializing in this field and therefor, the information I am giving is coming from a student. I hope you enjoy the read!**

*Please, ask questions about anything from my field, I am ready for it. I will also be happy to give some tips on the human anatomy pertaining to seduction and arousal if requested. Also, the views expressed are my understanding on the science. The majority of it is based of fact and credible science. The information of pheromones is slightly more controversial. If you have any doubts about what I have stated as a fact, please ask me and I will do my best to cite a credible source*

Hey there guys, This is my first time ever posting on Reddit, though I have been here for about a year. I am on my fourth year at university working on a degree in psycho-biology. It is the field of study that focuses on the scientific and neurological explanations for the way organisms act. It is very much based on evolution and natural selection. I have read dozens of papers and taken several classes specifically on human sexuality and I am posting here because I believe that much of it is incredibly relevant to this sub. 

Just some history on me. I am a 22 year old student from Canada. I have an enormous passion for the sciences. I apply what I learn in the classroom to what I do on the weekends at bars and I am incredibly successful with females; for an average looking guy. I think I can help a lot of you out too.

*Tips For attracting the opposite sex through knowledge of human sexuality*

* **Be Confident**
I realize that on this sub, this pointer is beating glue with a stick. That is because it is absolutely true. Women are hard wired to be attracted to the male she thinks would give her offspring the best genetics. More than appearance, this is dominance. Make yourself an alpha-male.

* **Don't try too hard- appear aloof.**
An organism would not survive natural selection if it mated with just anyone. Neurologically, we desire the best we can obtain. If you appear that you could do better than the target using things like body language, she will believe it.

* **Get in shape**
This one is fairly obvious and requires little explanation. In our DNA, there is a need to create the offspring with the best possible chance of survival. Making yourself look healthier will create this effect on females.

* **Wear bright colors, specifically red**
The peacock has a fascinating mating ritual. The female peacock doesn't go for the largest male, it goes for the most lavish one. In research done, males have effectively been peacock blocked when researchers cut off some of the flashy parts of their tails. *Don't dress like a douche bag* simply, wear colors that make you stick out while still dressing modest. The best color to choose is red. It attracts female attention on a subconscious level. It also makes you look healthier given your skin tone. No fucking fedoras guys

* **Speak slowly, smile often, don't laugh too easily**
This is more psychological than biological. You will come of as over anxious if you speak to fast. Smiling makes you more attractive (in most cases) and if you laugh at her jokes too easily you will come off as desperate. Make her earn your affections

* **Initiate contact**
When we do anything from cuddling and kissing to full on sex, the parties involved release oxytocin, a bonding hormone. Females have a tendency to release more more than the male. Intimate contact will cause the female to become biochemically attached to you. Never miss an opportunity to hug or snuggle the object of your affections.

* **Re. Rebounding -When you break up, you go through withdrawal**
There is a ton of neurological activity going on in your head when you are with someone that you are in a romantic relationship with, and even more when in physical contact. Chemicals are being released that change your state of mind to a degree. Much like alcohol or any other narcotic, when this attachment is broken, your body goes through a type of withdrawal. You will try and make up for it in another way, which often leads to a sexual encounter with another party. This is some of the science behind rebounding after a relationship.




The theory of the science of attraction is simple. In physics, if given all of the required numbers pertaining to the equation, we would be able to determine any given outcome in the physical world. Attraction is no different, it is a science, and using the science one should be able to improve there chances of manipulating the outcome of encounters


Thanks for reading! I really hope these helped. **I plan on updating this list with a few more tips later today.** If anyone else has done similar research, I would love to hear from you guys.

To be a ‘player’ or a ‘ladies’ man’ is not about sticking out or bringing attention or reputation towards you. A true player always flies under the radar. He is the average guy simply talking to a chick at the bar, or the guy who you hardly took notice of during your night out. A true Player would never call himself a player; he wouldn't like what it represents. Instead he might reply when accused “nah man I’m just having a good time” all the while understanding what you’re on about but not interested in the mentality that comes along with it.
A true player would never want to be known as a ‘Player’.

He knew he had made mistakes... of course he knew, but with each date he convinced himself he was gradually improving. Though few went well, he was sure that eventually something would click with someone. It *had* to.
 
 He buttoned up his favorite shirt while he practiced smiling in the mirror.
 
 ""You've got this. People like you, you're awesome,"" he said through his smile. 
 
 On his way to the bar, he reminded himself of all that he had learned in previous months. Smile. Eye contact. Be assertive. Be sexy. Neg. Kino. Got it. Go.
 
 Three hours later he returned to a lonely home, dejected, confused, and alone.
 
 What had gone wrong? He tried putting into play all that he had learned, and yet no one paid him any attention or showed the slightest interest. The girls he had spoken with acted bothered more than flattered. Despite his good body language, the negging, the eye contact, he felt like a god damned smuck.
 
 The next morning he woke up, and brushing off the prior's night's events like one would discard their dirty laundry, he exclaimed, ""FUCK IT"" To the world.
 
 Disregarding all he had learned about fashion, he threw on some shorts, flip flops, stuck a hat backwards on his head, and with a Twisted Sister anthem booming in his mind, embarked into the world.
 
 He walked through the grocery store with intense purpose and a focus akin to a laser beam. He saw an attractive woman - blonde, busty, about thirty. She was with her boyfriend. As he passed his peripheral caught her staring. He pivoted his head and directed his gaze towards her. She held it, and after a moment gave a flirty smile. This puzzled our young hero, but he wasn't going to be distracted or slowed. He had some mother fucking chicken to buy. His flip flops smacked the tile with a defying cadence, his arms swung freely at his sides. As he approached the poultry section, he noticed a young brunette walking towards him. She quickly averted eye contact and looked towards the ground. He grabbed a package of chicken breasts, examined the price tag for half a moment, then tossed it on the shelf with casual disapproval. The brunette had noticeably slowed her pace and was playing with her hair. He grabbed another package, ensured it was adequate, and turned around. She glanced at him.
 
 He gave her a nod and a wink. 
 
 * A wink? Who the hell winks?* he heard a voice inside him ask.
 
 *I fucking do. That's who.* and he silently challenged anyone to question it.
 
 She gave a big grin, and he pressed on towards the registers. It was at this moment that he stumbled upon a revelation, a paradox; to attract women he had to not give a shit if he attracted women. He felt something open in his mind. A new attitude, a new self. He felt strong, certain. He fixated his focus on tapping into this newfound mental state. He felt energy, freedom from judgement. 

 Some muscle head was walking towards him with his girlfriend. He casually looked them both in the eye, not because of some unwritten obligation to make eye contact with everyone, not because he was trying to appear confident, but because he fucking felt like it. He scrutinized the boyfriend. What a fucking douche. What a tool. He looked at her. She was cute, he gave her a smile and moved on.
 
 Our young Bruce Willis, our Clint Eastwood ventured towards the register line. His pulse was quickened, he felt energetic, his movement were sharp and deliberate. A lovely woman carrying a baby offered to let him go in front of her filled cart. He told her she was sweet while he grabbed a magazine from the shelf and examined its cover. There was silence, a moment of awkwardness. No there wasn't. Not on his watch. He was in control and refused to allow awkwardness. He placed the magazine back and told her said she had a cute baby. Not with a slick grin, not as though it were an ""opener"". He stated it as though he was commenting on the quality of a paint job on a Dodge Charger. As the conversation progressed between the two of them, he didn't lose focus. He gave her every ounce of attention but silently communicated that he was busy, damn it. He had places to be. Her friend joined her. She was beautiful. He asked her name. He wasn't hoping for approval or fretting about whether she liked him, he asked for it like he was asking for a refill on his pepsi. She gave him her name. 

Five minutes of conversation and two phone numbers later, our bold hero walked out of the store and everything clicked. Finally it made sense... almost zen-like. To be sought after, you must remain unavailable. To make new friends, you can't care whether you make new friends. One must not accept fear, and one must not avoid it. A successful man has to blow through it like a fucking freight train and ask for more. 
 
 Not giving a fuck. the best thing that ever happened to me.

1371584863.0,420,self.seduction,1glsxw,How to Cold Read? Look Down.,548,128,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1glsxw/how_to_cold_read_look_down/,"I thought it was high time I give a bit back to the community, so I'd like to give a few quick pointers on a much debated, often misunderstood, and occasionally maligned topic: The Cold Read. 

I am not great at a great many things, but I am absolutely a badass when it comes to cold reading. Without getting deep into my CV, I will now offer a simple method for *the substance* of an excellent cold read. This method is field tested, literally over fifty times, and without a single embarrassing outcome. For the sake of time, I'm not going to get into the transitions that I use, other than to say I almost always use the ring routine. I have modified it slightly and it's a thing of beauty. 

So, you're about to cold read, and you need something to say, but what?  For some of us with a touch more experience, the clothes a girl wears, as well as the way she carries herself, certain responses to questions, even eye movements and body gestures are all subtle clues. However, you can't just develop these skills overnight, so what do you do? 

Simple: Look at her shoes!  Seriously, think of three adjectives to describe her footwear, then lace these adjectives into the cold read. Think I'm full of shit? Think again. 

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/judge-90-percent-people-personalities-shoes-researchers-192903995.html

http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/15/shoe-choice-shows-personality-traits-study.html

Yeah. Not only does science back this technique, I have personally tried it many times with great success. 

Example: chick wearing flats: ""Comfortable, Practical, Sensible"" 

Okay, now here's my secret sauce, (use wisely) I use the Stewie Griffin ""Compliment Sandwich""

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewIT_KAQQlU

So in the above example I'd say, 

Bread: ""I bet you tend to be considered the more practical one of your friends. Do you have a lot of crazy friends?"" (every girl secretly thinks her friends are bat shit crazy) 

Meat: ""I'd guess, if given the choice, you would value comfort over style"" (very subtle neg, very effective. Use caution)

Bread: ""Finally, I'd guess that while most ladies tend to act on instinct, you probably rely on your sensible side more than others."" (Okay, so what are you really saying here? That you consider her more rational than other females, who's going to disagree?)

""What if she calls me out?"" It's happened to me several times, and you know what I've found? Chicks kind of dig the effort/novelty of it all. A girl I was seeing recently said to me, ""Huh, that was a pretty good cold read."" Guess what? Didn't change the escalating attraction one iota, because even if you get called out, you didn't *fail*. Quite the contrary, unlike the other assholes at the club, dog park, etc, you tried something other than random compliments, canned openers or what-have-you, AND because you heeded the advice of your dear 'ol interweb pal, Irish_Machiavelli, you have almost certainly delivered a better cold read than any of the AFC's who've tried just making hedging generalizations in hopes of striking pay dirt.  

tl;dr want to cold read, but not sure what to say? Look at her shoes for clues

I leave you now with the master of the Cold Read.

Edit: Alright, so I’ve gotten a decent amount of interest in my modifications for Style’s famous “ring routine.” When I began this post, I wanted to offer a nice piece of easy advice, and certainly didn’t intend on giving out strictly proprietary information! All jokes aside, this modification is a great point of pride for me. I happily and willingly share it and in exchange, I simply ask that you think about why it works and attempt to implement it as best you can. Also, guess what? I’m not going to sacrifice detail in favor of a short post; there will be no tl;dr for this bit.  

The thing I’m about to share doesn’t merely assure cold read success. It is a great DHV, it’s an excellent bridge from boring small talk to making you seem intelligent and intriguing, and, if you’re smart, it also serves as the perfect transition into more sexual topics and endeavors. 

Okay, here we go! Just so we’re all on the same page, here is the original ring routine. 

http://www.stylelife.com/challenge/2012/TheRingFingerRoutine.pdf

From the article
&gt;II. POCKET GUIDE
THUMB = Poseidon, representing individuality
INDEX = Zeus, representing dominance, power, and energy
MIDDLE = Dionysus, representing irreverence, rebelliousness, and decadence
RING = Aphrodite, representing love and romance
PINKY = Ares, representing war

Okay, skim it so you get the idea, but don’t commit that shit to memory, we’re about to go all freaky on it. Did you read all that bullshit about what the rings actually signify? Disregard. The rings she has on signify whatever her shoes tell you. Period. Don’t be Orson Welles and start to think you actually are psychic. Rings = vehicle. Shoes = personality. Got it? Good. Okay, here’s the script. Personal comments throughout.   

(A Natural lag in conversation has set it, you feel out that long pause to make sure it’s real and it’s a good time to speak without interruption)

You (formerly me): I see you wear a ring on your (blank) finger(s). Why?

Honey: Yeah, (some trite anecdote about where the ring is from)

You: Interesting. I once read an incredibly dense book on the fall of the Roman Republic, and learned something intriguing about the rings people wore; I’m fascinated by ancient Roman history. See, in ancient Rome, there were no religions, but rather cults to certain gods. Basically, whatever finger someone wore a ring on symbolized the god they were trying to represent.  

(Take note of exactly what’s happening here. First, suggestive language: “Interesting, fascinating, intriguing.” AFC’s simply don’t talk like this, and these types of words not only hook her interest, but will also become associated with *you* in her mind for that very reason. Second, will she think you’re a nerd? Hell yeah. Is that a bad thing? Fuck no! You’re displaying an intellectual curiosity and believe it or not, *if you package it right* that shit *is* a turn-on. Finally, I’ve run the routine in front of groups and one on one, this set up never fails to silence the audience, meaning you just became an alpha.)

Honey: Really? 

You: Yes. Haven’t you ever thought about it?

You calmly extend your hand, turn your wrist, and open your palm

You: Give me your hand, I'll show you (DHV/Kino) 

She complies. If she looks hesitant, simply say, “Oh grow a pair! I’m not gonna bite…at least not yet.” She’ll then comply. Now, you’re deep into the sales routine. 

Slowly, *methodically,* you apply a firmly gentle touch to each finger as you speak. Your voice is butter on hot bread. You start with her ring finger. Always start with the ring finger! 

You: We all know Henry VIII was the first to put a ring on his lady’s finger. Do you know why he did that?

Honey: Because there’s a vein leading to the heart! (If she says she doesn’t know why, then you say this part, but I’m pretty sure all “western” girls know this)

You: Very good! (You just became a teacher) Well, guess what? Roman battle surgeons knew about that vein a thousand years before Henry put a ring on it, and that’s the real reason we wear the wedding ring to symbolize love, because the ring finger represented the cult of Venus. 

(Now you pause. Assess reaction)

Honey: Hmmm

You: It doesn’t stop there. (touch her pinky now)This was for Mars, the god of war. Have you seen the godfather? Do you think it’s a coincidence that all mafia dons wear a ring on their pinky finger? It’s not. This tradition dates back to ancient Rome. 

(This should really have gotten her attention by now)

You: (taking her thumb) Neptune was granted his own kingdom in the ocean, and the thumb represents this independence. (take a moment to make really solid eye contact. Imagine puppies when you do so… your eyes should be smiling. Now take her index finger) This was the finger upon which all Roman generals wore a ring; the ultimate sign of authority, because the index finger represents the god of gods, Jupiter. (then her middle finger) And this is Dionysius, god of partying. His followers found truth in wine and worshiped revelry. 
(pause)

You: You see, the crazy thing is that these traditions didn’t end with Rome. I believe that these traditions have almost…(appear to be searching for words) transcended time and space and imprinted themselves onto our collective unconsciousness. That means that *if I’m right,* (you're hedging against a cold read misstep here) I can tell quite a bit about you based on the rings you wear.

(Pause… you’re waiting for something here) 

Honey: So what does that say about me?  (PS, I have literally never witnessed someone not ask what this all means about them or shrug off this routine. She wants to know, nay she needs to know!!! After all it is about her most favorite topic: herself) 

You: Well, clearly you are representing (insert rings on which fingers are worn) This typically indicates (insert shoe adjectives) because (tie gods to shoe adjectives) 

Example. Girl wearing flats (see above) with a ring on, let’s say, the thumb, and index finger, or Neptune and Jupiter respectively.   

You: So you’re clearly following Neptune, who was known for his independence, and Jupiter, known as the leader of the gods. Because you’re rocking Jupiter, I would guess you’re very sensible. Do your friends usually come to you for advice? (hint: girls talk something like 7 times more than men, with their close friends and loved ones. Some of this is statistically certain to be advice) 

Well, Neptune needed his own kingdom to be comfortable, and I’d be willing to bet you’re the same way. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that, given the choice, you value comfort over style, right?

(See if she gets the neg or not) 

Then, because you have two of the three main gods, I’d guess you’re very practical. Do you see yourself as having more common sense or maybe intelligence than the average female? (hint: a recent study indicated the vast majority of people see themselves as smarter than “average.” As mathematically impossible as it is useful to know when in the field)

(BTW, you still have her hand in yours and you have for quite some time. Did she notice? Did you? No, because you're doing it right)

This is where you’ve got to decide where to go. I’ve literally used this routine to entertain a group of people who watched me # close a gorgeous blonde at a house party, in front of them. I also used it to F close a girl from a bar when we were back in her place, not but three weeks ago. I suggest using this as a lead up to a K-close, because if you’ve done it right, you’ve created an amazing connection, kino’ed like a mother fucker, and also shown that you’re smart, charming, and super interesting. 

Ah, now for housekeeping

Item 1. What if she’s not wearing a ring? run the routine exactly as before, but when it comes time for the cold read, you say:

You: Not wearing a religious identifier was unheard of in ancient times, meaning that even no rings represented someone: Mercury. See, Mercury was the messenger god, meaning he couldn’t be weighed down with such trinkets.  

(Guess what else? Mercury’s expeditious nature also happens to line up perfectly with whatever adjectives her shoes are screaming at you… weird, huh?)

Item 2. If you’re going to do this routine, don’t you think it might be wise to wear a couple rings yourself? I always leave the house with one on my middle finger (I’m a man-whore) and one on either my pinky (I’m a baller) or my index finger (I’m a boss) Be sure to display your rings while explaining what they mean. 

Item 3. Why did you change them from Greek to Roman? Because the gods are the same, Rome is more identifiable than Greek culture, and of course, to avoid detection as we're using a widely publicized cold read. Also, ancient Rome is coo.

Item 4. Yeah that’s it. This is some of my A material, guys. I hope you enjoy it and make good use of it. I’ll send a prayer to Dionysus on your behalf.  

Edit 2: Hey guys, thanks so much for all the love! I hope it helps you out. One final clarifying point: The ring routine is the *routine* The information you get from her shoes is *information* these are not two distinct routines. Think of the Ring Routine as the car, and the ""shoe info"" as the gas you put into the car.

Attraction is the name of the game. Attractive men run businesses and governments, sleep with gorgeous women, accumulate wealth, and live successful lives of abundance. Above all else, you want to be attractive.

There are four factors that serve to generate attraction.

---

**1) Authenticity**

A lot has been written about confidence. If you boil it down to its simplest parts, however, confidence can be defined as authenticity.

An authentic man is a man who lives a life of honesty to himself and the world. He is in tune with his true values and isn't afraid to show them to others. He stands proverbially naked to the world, warts and all. When he thinks a woman is beautiful, he tells her. When he dislikes something, he speaks up. When he wants something, he pursues it. An authentic man seeks truth, friendship, love, sex, and beauty. He is unabashed in his pursuits because he lives a life of authenticity. He has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, not to himself nor others.

An authentic man understands the difference between his ego (socially conditioned limiting beliefs) and his being (his true self). He lives to satisfy his being's true desires. The world is his oyster, and yet he knows it owes him nothing. He possesses true confidence: The confidence to know that if there is any human way to acquire something he desires, he will get it, but if it's not in the cards, then he shrugs it off, ""It was never meant to be.""

**Ways to demonstrate authenticity:** Speaking honestly and openly. Showcasing strong body language. Utilizing rapport-neutral/breaking vocal tonality.

---

**2) Desire**

Women desire men who desire women. All women, heck, all human beings, long to be desired. Being desired is a fundamental pleasure that we all enjoy. 

A lot of traditional pickup theory advocates opening indirectly and masking one's intentions. FUCK THAT NOISE. The battle of ""direct versus indirect"" has been fought and direct has won. Indirect opening and masking one's intentions is the primordial ooze that the Friend Zone crawled out of. You desire her, don't you? FUCKING TELL HER.

Now what does that mean? Yes, it means telling a girl she's cute and that you want to get to know her better... But you know what is even more important? TOUCH. Yes, let your body do the talking! After many years of observation, I've realized one thing... All the best seducers can't keep their hands off the women they find attractive. It's as if something primal inside of them compels them to go after what they **desire.**

Women want a man to dominate them in the bedroom. They want the hair at the base of their neck pulled. They want a man to groan in bed with them. They want to be ravished and told how fucking sexy they are. They want to be seduced and FUCKED by a real man.

**Ways to demonstrate desire:** Touch. Direct statements of intent. Strong, unwavering eye contact. Passionate sex.

---

**3) Excitement**

Women want to be taken on magic carpet rides. Women want adventure in their lives. They want to wake up the morning after meeting a man thinking, ""Wow, who WAS that guy?"" Women want to feel beautiful. Women want amazing stories to tell their friends and make them jealous. Women want passion. Women want to be swept off their feet.

Are you leaving an amazing first impression with the women you meet? Are your date ideas better than anyone else's you know? Are you the one deciding what the next move is? Are you a leader of men?

If not, then you must focus on those parts of your interactions. From now on, never utter the words, ""So what do you want to do?"" ever again. YOU are a man with a plan. You decide what happens next. Your reality is so strong that she is absorbed into it. You do and say things to her that no one has ever done or said before. You are unique.

**Ways to demonstrate excitement:** Keep a leading frame. Be unique. Use non-sequiturs in conversation. Do random things for the lulz.

---

**4) Lifestyle**

You have eclectic interests and hobbies. You have a job you actually enjoy or are pursuing a career/education that is in touch with your being's true desires. You have interesting friends and go on adventures all the time. 

You have studied fashion and take care to look good. You work out. You make a conscious effort to have the best hygiene possible.

**Ways to demonstrate lifestyle:** Live a great life and people will take notice.

---

**Action Items**

1) Grab your notebook. Look at the notes you made in [Part 1.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11piau/above_the_game_part_1_primer_on_who_you_will/) Analyze them. Are you being entirely honest with yourself? Is there more you could be doing? Did you write down unattainable goals? Write them out again, this time with 100% honesty to yourself. Review and alter these notes at LEAST once a week until you are satisfied that you are being 100% authentic.

2) Try to go an entire day without masking your intentions or true feelings. Vocalize how you honestly feel while treating everyone you talk to with respect. Try to catch yourself every time you're being less than 100% honest. Examples:

* *""Oh no, it's totally okay you asked me to work late with no notice.""*

* *""I don't mind that you canceled an hour before our date.""*

* *""Oh yeah, Nickelback's awesome.""*

* *""My hobbies are lame, you don't want to hear about them...""*

* *""I'm okay being exclusive.""*

3) Continue step #2 for a week, then 2 weeks. Then a month. Then 90 days. 

4) Go outside, find an attractive woman and say, ""You know, you are absolutely beautiful. I just had to tell you that."" See? That wasn't so bad, right? Now do it again. And again. After ten approaches, try and initiate a short conversation. Do not let a week go by without telling a beautiful woman that she is beautiful ever again. Don't let your seduction muscles atrophy.

5) Think of a random and fun outing that you doubt many men would ever think of. Once you think something up, go out to a bar or coffee shop. Approach a handful of women and say, ""Excuse me, I was wondering what you think of this date idea..."" Get their honest opinion on it. If it goes over well, jot it down in your notebook. Repeat this until you have 25 random and fun date ideas. Use these liberally - you are now more exciting than 99% of men.

6) Be honest with yourself... Are you happy with your sense of style and fashion? If you aren't (and you probably aren't!), spend 10 hours reading fashion magazines and forums and another 10 hours talking to the salespeople at high-end men's clothing stores. Develop a sense of style that you think might work and, just like in step 5, run it by a handful of well-dressed women. Take their opinions to heart, but with a grain of salt. Jot down what you think you want to look like and go buy yourself a new wardrobe. If you cannot afford to do so, start saving 10% of your income every week until you can. Buy yourself at least ONE great outfit as soon as possible.

7) Tell at least one close friend or family member about your new journey to improve yourself as a man and beg them to pester you about it on a weekly basis. Hold them to this.",Comprehensive,False,,t5_2qhrv,1374516676.0,,,True,t3_11yjkw,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11yjkw/above_the_game_part_2_fundamentals_of_attraction/,moderator

i'm posting about this because i was reminded this weekend with two different girls about how awesome/critical this little detail is.

when i was able to unhook the bra effortlessly with one hand, each girls reacted differently but both very positively that led to even more passionate kissing, teasing by kissing/licking her breasts and then amazing sex.

one of the girls reacted more innocently and asked if she should be worried that i can unhook a bra so easily, suggesting that i am a player. i could have denied this by trying to appear to be a nice guy, but i've learned that the ""agree and amplify"" technique works wonders to continue escalation/flirting. i just joked that i have a closet full of bras that i practice with every night, and she enjoyed the joke and continued making out with me.

here's a [fairly mediocre how-to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiL25Au51AI) on the topic. if you guys know of a better one, share it below.

1348812507.0,421,self.seduction,10lvp1,"AA is nothing. Escalation Anxiety is what needs to be overcome. Here's, IMO, how.",511,90,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/10lvp1/aa_is_nothing_escalation_anxiety_is_what_needs_to/,"The fist half of this post may be pretty familiar material for most people here.

Approach anxiety is the feeling most of us get when we see a cute girl and think about approaching her. It is usually a tightness in the chest, a fast heart rate, and a stream of self-doubt and rationalizations. The novice has taught himself how to act in spite of these feelings of uneasiness. He feels these things, but acts in spite of them. The AA is accepted rather than resisted. 

Unfortunately, while overcoming AA may lead to awesome opportunities and results for some, for others it may just open the door to the friend zone. Why? Because of a failure to escalate. 

Why is there a failure to escalate? Because of escalation anxiety, which I will refer to as EA. (I like this acronym because I fucking hate EA the game company and the EA in this post. So fuck all EAs. =D) EA manifests the exact same way as AA. Tightness in the chest, rationalizations, fast heart rate, and fear. EA pops its head out when you and your girl have a good vibe going and you think about touching her. Or kissing her. Or pulling her in. Or getting sexual. Or just asking for the number. 

So, what to do. Realize next time you feel EA, it is a fork in the road. Choice number one: do not escalate and STAY IN YOUR COMFORT ZONE. This is probably the sole reason for a lack of escalation. The fucking comfort zone, where you are talking to a hot girl and having a good conversation and you just don't want to FUCK it up. Anyway, that is choice one. Stay in the nice little comfort zone.

Choice two is to ACT when you feel EA hit. Use EA as a CUE. Not sure when you should try and touch her leg or put your arm around her? When you get the feelings of EA. Do it THEN. The key, I believe, is to use it as your cue to man the fuck up. So next time you get those feelings in your gut while your chatting it up with a cute girl, remember they signify its time to make a choice. Train yourself to make the right one, make it your catalyst. 

This post is probably the epitome of inner game circle jerking, but I sorta just wanted to put my thoughts out there, and hear opinions. Thanks for reading it, lemme know your thoughts.

1372016233.0,417,self.seduction,1gx92i,Billy's Guide to Demonstrating High Value,523,106,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gx92i/billys_guide_to_demonstrating_high_value/,"When picking up a woman, you have visual and non-visual value. The visual value is easy to communicate, just pull up your shirt and let her see your glorious abs. Non-visual value needs a little more finesse to demonstrate.

Before going on, it'll be helpful to have read the article on [Atomic Game](http://stopbetashit.com/?page_id=38). To communicate value you need to believe you have value, and it really helps if you actually have value.

**Show, Don’t Tell**

The key to demonstrating value (other than having value and believing in yourself) is a concept well known to writers: Show, don’t tell. The way this has typically been explained in the community is “a rich man doesn’t need to say that he’s rich.”

Telling someone your good traits (awesome job, your shiny car, how you can run a marathon, or how your ex GF was really hot) just makes them think you’re insecure. If you were confident, you wouldn’t feel the need to tell people how great you are. It’s also just not at all convincing. Attraction is a feeling, not a reasoned weighing of the facts.

Showing your value on the other hand, that’s powerful. If you tell a girl that you’re really funny, she’ll think you’re just weird and suck at conversation. If you make her laugh, she’ll think you’re funny. Tell her about your awesome friends and she’ll wonder why you aren’t hanging out with them. Show up to the club with your awesome friends and let everyone see you having a good time, and she’ll think you’re a cool, popular guy.

**Social Proof**

Social proof is when you have other people vouch for you being an attractive, quality guy. Again, not telling, but showing. When you go to a bar with a group of friends and you are all joking with each other, have a lot of energy, and are having a good time, that’s social proof. If you were a loser, you wouldn’t be out with a bunch of cool dudes having fun, therefor everyone who sees your group knows you’re not a loser.

Hanging out with women, especially attractive women, is even better. Why would attractive women hang out with you if you were a low value loser? They wouldn’t. Even if you’re not a very good looking guy, women will assume you must have something else going for you if you can keep the attention of women.

If you’re sarging solo, social proof can be harder. In fact, if you’re out alone people may assume that it’s because you don’t have any friends, and so you end up with negative value. To overcome this, start chatting up people as soon as you arrive. Guys, girls, doesn’t matter. Be friendly to everyone. A girl who sees you talking to a couple guys doesn’t know that you just met them. Now you’ve got social proof.

For sarging solo, you’ll also want to consider doing more day game. It’s normal to be in a bookstore or cafe by yourself, so being alone in that setting doesn’t come with any negative assumptions.

**Confidence**

Confidence is a bit of an odd thing because it’s both a demonstration of value and an actual value itself. We like confident people, they’re just more fun to be around than people who are shy, timid, and never want to go out and have an adventure. But it’s also a way of demonstrating a generalized high value.

People are shit at judging value in a vacuum, so we look for clues. As I’ve said, social proof is one clue. Another big clue though is someone’s opinion of himself. No one has greater information about your value than yourself. You’re biased, but you’re also the world’s foremost expert.

If you act like a beta, show no confidence, and are always apologizing just for taking up space in the world, people will assume this is because you actually are low value. After all, would a really cool high value guy present himself as a piece of shit loser? Andy Kaufman aside, no way. So if you act like a loser it must be because you are one. Girls won’t waste their time trying to tell if your opinion of yourself is wrong.

It works the same way with being alpha.If you act like you’re an alpha people are very likely to believe you. There’s plenty of reasons to think you’d lie about being alpha, but that’s why I said people believe you when you act alpha. It’s hard to lie through actions, so when you act confident people will assume you have something to be confident in.

Confidence is also a form of guerrilla social proof. If you approach a girl with confidence and are comfortable talking to her, she will assume that talking to girls is something you do all the time. She hasn’t seen you with girls, but she’ll believe your life is filled with them.

Getting confidence is the trick though, and there is no magic bullet fix. Working on actually having value will help (Atomic Game), so will doing an honest assessment of your value (Inner Game). But while you’re working on that other stuff, just give yourself a little bit of positive self-talk, take a deep breath, jump in and remember that simply acting confident gives you some value. The ability to approach a stranger is a rare and admirable trait, so at a bare minimum you have that going for you.

**Dancing Monkey Syndrome**

You just delivered your opener perfectly, dropped some really funny jokes, everyone laughed a lot, and then you did a couple magic tricks and the set is completely blown away. Too bad you’ve about to be blown out.

You’ve contracted Dancing Monkey Syndrome. You’re telling the set you opened that you’re there to entertain them. You might be entertaining, but you’re not attracting them — you’re showing them the desperate lengths you go to just to keep their attention. Opening a complete stranger with a funny joke shows confidence. Continuing the laugh parade shows a lack of confidence.

Dancing Monkey Syndrome is also incredibly impersonal. You can tell the same jokes the exact same way to someone completely different than the girl you’re talking to, and she knows it. Someone else could also tell her the same joke. There’s absolutely no connection between you. You want to be engaging and interesting, not merely entertaining. If all she wanted was entertainment, there’s always comedy specials on HBO.

**When Showing Isn’t an Option**

Show, Don’t Tell is the general rule, but showing isn’t always feasible. You’re not going to ask a girl to wait around for a couple hours while you complete a marathon, odds are the bar kitchen isn’t going to invite you back to show off your skills, and while you can show wealth by spending freely that tends to come across as try-hard and actually pretty insecure about all your other traits. So what does that leave? Telling. Fortunately, there are a couple tricks to make telling your good qualities a lot more effective.

I love to cook, and not just because I like eating, though that’s a nice fringe benefit. What I really like about it is the creative process and the experimentation. You take a bunch of ingredients and transform them into something completely different. And then you do it again and again and over time the recipes slowly evolve and you branch out and experiment. You learn the way different flavors interact, often in really surprising ways, like how a really simple peach glaze takes on a complex, three dimensional flavor when you add just a little bit of dijon mustard. Every time you have one of those little moments where you see a new way of combining ingredients that experience goes into this sort of mental file cabinet that you can draw from in the future, so you’re not just transforming the food — you’re transforming the way you see and think about food. Plus, you know, there’s also the food itself, and you get to eat it. So there’s that.

Reading that, you probably think that one thing that one source of value I have is being skilled at cooking. Yet, I didn’t even say I’m good at it. What gives?

Emotion. Enthusiasm. Passion. Whatever you want to call it, when we hear someone speak about something with emotion we immediately associate that thing with high value. (Except some obvious exceptions of course — if you complain with incredible compassion about how much you hate your boss you’re still not conveying value.) This works just like how we associate high prices with quality.

You also want to work in some details. They make the mental images you’re creating much more vivid and lend some credibility. If you enjoy cooking like I do, talk about a specific dish you especially enjoyed making; if you run marathons bring out a detail of the last marathon you ran, maybe a specific landmark you were passing as you broke through the wall and hit your runner’s high.

Finally, talking with emotion and enthusiasm does double duty. Just like confidence, it’s not only way of demonstrating your value, zest for life is itself a value. People who can talk about things in an exciting way make us feel excited, we want to be around those people more if for nothing than the energy they bring with them.

I've recently had a bad case of oneitis which has had me really stressed out, but on Friday I took a different girl, better looking out and things went better.


I passively invited her (I'll call her Jamie) to come to my friend's birthday gathering at a bar.  Jamie is a girl I've known for going on five years.  We liked each other way back, but I kind of pussed out and nothing had ever happened.


Anyway, I invited Jamie to come to the bar with me over facebook because I no longer had her number.  I was being sort of passive about it, when telling her about the event I said ""you could come,"" instead of ""you should come"" because I had read on this seddit that could is more effective than should. She says she might come, I give her the details and don't respond to her ""ok sounds good"" text.  An hour later she texts me saying she's in, and asking for my friend's address and whatnot.  I kept texting to a minimum, this was a new strategy for me and it worked out beautifully.


She arrives at my friend's house and we are watching the NCAA tournament and pregaming the bar.  We are there for about an hour and a half, drinking, talking and catching up.  Even though we are sitting next to each other and drinking, I kept Kino to a minimum because I figured I could escalate later at the bar and it might be weird to be touchy with a small group.  However, while we talked I held eye contact with her and smiled a lot, but had a laid back attitude and kept things positive.  If you haven't read the article on powergame and the various posts posts on keeping things positive, I recommend you do so. If I and a woman I am trying to seduce were talking about something I didn't find particularly interesting, I would put it down in a joking manner and attempt to change the subject.  This would sometimes work, but often times it would offend the woman.  The evening of this encounter, I challenged myself to make uninteresting topics or topics i didn't know about as fun for the both of us as possible.  She told me to she played on a hockey team, hockey is not my favorite sport and one I know little about, so I just asked open ended questions about her team and experiences playing and related it back to funny injuries I had suffered playing other sports and how awkward it is to be the youngest team in an adult intramural team. 


 I think it's important to share these details because a lot of people come to this site expecting a script of exactly what to say to get laid.  That is unrealistic, so you can either feign interest in things you find boring to try and get in her pants or you can make the conversation as interesting for the both of you as possible and enjoy every aspect of the seduction process.  It's all about how you frame the process for yourself, if you keep things positive internally and externally, both of you will enjoy yourselves.  She knew I wasn't knowledgeable on hockey, but was seemingly impressed by my willingness to discuss something that wasn't in my wheelhouse and ability to make it fun for both of us.  In short, stay positive and make things interesting and relatable for yourself.


After pregaming, we get a ride to this swanky downtown bar.  The place is loud and packed. When we arrive, we find the birthday boy who is far too intoxicated.  Most of his friends didn't even follow him to the bar, and it is clear that he'll soon be kicked out by a bouncer. Internally, I panic because I thought there'd be a lot of girls in the bigger group me were meeting up with (there were none), and becaues there is more pressure on me to entertain Jamie and my friend we were with.  To calm my nerves and counteract the my drunken friend, I suggest we ditch him to get a drink and explore.  Jamie agrees and we venture off.  The important thing to take away from this is an Alpha  recognizes a shitty situation, creates a new plan of action and is seemingly unaffected by things not going as planned.  A failed plan should be viewed as an opportunity to create and do something better.


When we get to the bar, Jamie pays for the first round.  If a girl wants to buy you a drink, LET HER.  It means she likes you, it means she's interested and it is implied that you are going to return the favor later on.  Insisting that you buy the round or pay for your own drink comes off as desperate and eager to please.  You're already pleasing her, that's why she's buying you a drink.


Take advantage of your environment.  We were at an huge bar with multiple levels, secret doors, and a bigger than average patio.  In the time we were there, we had two or three rounds.  Be practical and know you're surroundings: my strategy was to take our drinks tp the patio because the patio was quieter and less packed, therefore we could talk without yelling and drink without getting bumped/spilling.  It also created a nice environmental balance.  Staying in one place eventually gets boring so mix it up!  Girls will show you with their body language when they're ready for a change in environment, the key is to see her bored eyes and make the change in environment seem like your idea. and STAY POSITIVE!

At a certain point, my friend saw some girls he knew and talked to them.  I saw them, introduced myself (handshakes are key), and talked to them a bit.  Later on, Jamie went to the bathroom, and i saw these two girls near where me and my buddy were waiting.  I told my buddy to hang on a sec and went to talk to them (they weren't interested in him Having a good looking girl with me created social proof, so they were either attracted to me or enticed enough to convserse for a few minutes.  I escalated kino with the two of them pretty quickly, holding one girl's wrist when  I asked about her tattoo, and touching their shoulders when I made a joke (nothing groundbreaking I know, but it served a purpose).

I kept the bathroom Jamie used in my peripheral vision and decided to end the interaction with these two girls about a minute after she exited the bathroom.  This gave her enough time to go back to where we were waiting, see my friend, and see me talking to the other girls which would act as a DHV for me in Jamie's eyes.  This plan worked beautifully, but it only worked for the following reasons:  My friend was uninterested in Jamie, he trusted me completely, and both of us were unintersted in the other girls. I told the girls I had to meet up with my friends, hugged them both and went to Jamie and my friend.  The only thing I said regarding that situation was saying ""Those girls are crazy"" with a smile.  Talking to the other girls was probably unnecessary, but if you have a sure thing, it doesn't hurt to exercise your game. This *exercise* framed me as the *prize* in Jamie's eyes, was a DHV, and allowed Jamie to feel relieved when she saw me return.


We eventually took a cab (paid for by Jamie) to a cheaper bar about a block from my apartment.  We met up with Susie (a girl my friend knew and was interested in), and stayed until bar close.  We went on to get pizza, I paid for Jamie's to further repay her for the drinks and the cab ride, and took it back to my apartment.  An alpha  always pays a girl back and won't let her think he's taking advantage of her physically, emotionally or economically.


We eat the pizza watching sports center, I was pretty fucked up at this point.  Anyway, Jamie went to the bathroom and I was starting to pass out on the couch.  She comes back and sits on my lap.  I tell her I'm tired and she says ""We should go to bed.""  She goes and waits in my bedroom while i go to the bathroom.  Then, for the first time in a little more than a year, I had sex and it was awesome haha.


A few key things: I stopped masturbating a little less than three weeks prior to this date (don't fap, it helps).  I went in without any expectations in mind, and the only goad I had was to stay positive all night (I succeeded).  I texted the girl the next day, and eventually made plans to see her again this coming weekend (this helped with the oneitis more than the sex did, but I'm fairly sure neither of us want a relationship at this juncture).  Even if you don't want a relationship, the day after text is important because girls get nervous about their sexual peformance, too (especially if alcohol is involved).  RELAX AND STAY POSITIVE.


I know this field report is long as fuck, but I wanted to show some of the other newbies that you can go from AFC to boss as long as you stay positive and confident.  


I also wanted to note that, while it was an awesome night and the sex was great, I was quickly reminded that having sex with an attractive girl doesn't fix your problems.  I've been diagnosed with ADD, Depression and anxiety. It's easy to get fooled by our sexual *American Pie* culture constantly telling us that happiness is a warm pussy.  I fucked a hot girl and, without even realizing it, expected that I'd instantly be a happier, cooler person.  When I wasn't transformed,  the normal depression and anxiety I feel and deal with everyday blindsided me.  I was so caught up in thinking I was someone else, I forgot who I am and how I normally feel. To clarify, I do feel daily symptoms of my neuroses, but they don't really effect me because I live a generally healthy lifestyle.  The happiness that results from my healthy lifestyle and the advice I took from this subreddit are why I had the confidence are the tools I needed to have sex.  Sex with an attractive girl isn't a source of instant happiness, it's the result of happiness and awesomeness you already have.

1363450014.0,415,self.seduction,1aew73,Kind vs. Nice - a possible series of word pair problems,493,78,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1aew73/kind_vs_nice_a_possible_series_of_word_pair/,"No one asked for this, but it got few up votes as a comment so I thought I'd expand.

A little background: *I'm not a pick up artist, I'm a follower of the lifestyle and fully believe it is a lifestyle choice. I'm a believer that most of the people out there in the field following tips on PUA aren't pick up artists, they are just people (women included) that are righting the wrongs of social norms that don't make sense and the majority of what people learn from PUA is self motivation. I'm a big believer in behavioural psychology which is all I believe pickup really is.

If you are looking for something more generalised: I'm a firm believer in genuine seduction through motivation, improvement and action.

A long time ago I compiled a few bits and pieces from various forums and books and put them on a background of a Zooey Deschanel poster and posted it on 4chan. You've probably seen it, read and noticed the spelling mistakes. A lot of  what I wrote I don't agree with now because it was copied, but one thing I do stand by is the word pairs I came up with based on my forum lurking.*

Nice/Kind, Factual/Interesting, Funnny/Fun, Random/Spontaneous, Arrogance/Confidence, Confidence/Comfort.

If you like bold statements: **learning the difference between these words is key not only to pick up, but key to life**. If you want something more sweeping: the difference between the words is pretty simple but most people suck at simple stuff.

**Part One: Nice vs. Kind**

**Nice:**

The vast majority of people grew up in a caring family, the likelihood is that most of you would have learnt to be polite and say please and thank you. The other early life lesson we are taught by our parents is to ""be nice"". **The idea of nice for most people is to pretend to like those we don't**, that there is this façade that we all put on and pretend to be friends with everyone. 

You've probably got someone you work with who continuously tells you that ""you're great"" and things are ""awesome"" even though you barely speak and what you are actually doing is ""routine"" and ""ordinary"".  **Nice is an unbalancing act, making people feel more wanted than they actually are and rewarding small tasks with big pay offs**. Whatever lifestyle you look at there is this idea of not putting people on pedestals, with PUA it's women, with fapstronauts it's pornstars, with redpillars it's god knows what these days. However like I said before I believe in behaviourism and therefore the easiest behaviour to change is yours.

Can we apply this concept to yourself? Of course! The nice guy. We all love that phrase. Nice guys finish last. Why is that?  The easiest way to explain this is with a magic trick. 

I pull out a coin from my pocket and ask to borrow a cigarette or pen from you. I open my palm and place the coin flat in my left hand. Taking the pen in my right I tell you to focus on the coin and watch. I tap the coin with the pen once, twice and then on the third time the pen vanishes. I point out that pen is behind my ear. 

Now **imagine someone who was watching the trick turns to you and tries to impress you with exactly the same trick. Are you impressed? No of course not, because you know the trick**.

The same goes with ""nice guy"" attitudes. **The majority of people have been taught to ""be nice"", they've all been taught the magic trick**. So when you start being nice, and start complimenting someone whilst getting no feedback that this person is remotely interested in you, everyone in the room can see you're ""being nice"". Everyone can see you're putting on a front; in this case to get laid. You end up putting people on a pedestal and when you've got them up that high it's very difficult to ask them to come down to go on a date with you.

Nice is **nasty**, it's **fake** and it's a **façade. You need to stop now.**

~~~~~~

**Kind**

OK so we've dropped ""being nice"", what's the alternative. The alternative is being kind. **Kindness is a product of what a lot of people spout around these parts: being genuine.** Kindness is a balancing act, it's weighing up the situation in front of you and making a decision.

Kindness is often linked to religion and morality. You hear phrases like ""Christian values"" or ""religious driving practices"", there is the idea of deliberately obstructing yourself in order to free others. **That's because kindness, like much of life, isn't easy.** Being nice is easy to do, you just continuously act and without fail do the ""nice"" thing. Being kind is about doing the right thing, not the easy thing. This generally involves taking time out of your routine or schedule to help someone else without thought of being rewarded for it. **You are being kind because you want to be.**

Niceness as I've said is an act whereas kindness, if you allow it to, becomes a compulsion, a desire and almost instinctive. This is part of what I believe in seduction is letting an ideal or a motivation go from practice to permanence. If you allow it to stop being an act it will become a part of your genuine self.

Where does kindness come into seduction? **Well kindness builds trust and rapport with people** as opposed to being a nice guy which breeds distrust through your manipulative ways. **Kindness plays into the abundance mindset** as well, you have plenty of time that you can spare time to help people with shopping, give people directions, socialise, mix with people and most importantly have fun.

Here's another example of the difference between kindness and niceness. Imagine someone came up to you in the middle of the street and said ""hey there's this brand new club it's doing this drink offer tonight…"" most people know that this is a complete façade, you're trying to get me to go to a club, you're being paid to be nice to me. OK what if you were looking for a club and you were lost and you tried asking for directions and no one seems to help, then someone comes over and says ""are you looking for ____. Well you're a bit far away from it to be fair, there is a club just down the road and if I hear right they're doing this drink offer."" 

The two events are framed differently and said differently, but in the second instance someone is going out of their way to help you. As a result you are more likely to engage in conversation with them, you build rapport and are more likely to go to the club they are recommending because your defences are down. 

A final point: the two questions that go through a girls mind when a guy approaches are widely said to be: ""what does this guy want?"" and ""how long is he going to be here"". Many people try and diffuse these situations with time markers, and quirky openers. If you use kindness to your advantage people don't look for those two questions because a) you don't want anything there's no agenda and b) you'll only be there as long as they want you to be there. 

Kindness is a demonstration of **caring, lack of agenda and an abundant mindset and attitude.**

Don't be.,496,82,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11cwwu/are_you_afraid_of_making_a_fool_out_of_yourself/,"This is a problem that i struggled with for quite some time. The fear of looking like an idiot, both in pickups and outside of it, always kept me a little nervous, which led to me acting stiff and reserved. Obviously didn't work well with the game.

However, after some time i started figuring out why it really doesn't matter. And this is done by reflecting how you react to other people who makes fools out of themselves.

Imagine that you tell a joke. But nobody gets it. Feels pretty bad, does't it? It feels like people will view you as an idiot. Can ruin your whole day, thinking of how stupid you were.

Now, imagine the times where you have been hanging out with some, or just chatting with a bunch of people in general. One of them tries to say something funny, but nobody laughs. 

Now, think of how you reacted. Did you think he was an idiot, or did you just shrug and then kept on talking? This is just how others react when you make a social ""misstep."" Your mistakes are as unimportant to them, as theirs are to you.

I'm sure you have been in a class, where someone had accidentally farted. Yeah, you made fun of the person for 2 minutes, then everybody moved on with their lives. At the end of the day, nobody remembered it.

Do you feel that you have a bad hair day? How often have you looked at someone and actually cared wether they have a lock hanging out of place or not? 

Do you think you have too hairy arms? Keep trying to cover them up? How many times have you actually noticed how hairy someone is when you sit next to them in class, or walk past them? If you did notice, how much did you actually care?

Point being: You feel much worse about your own mistakes than you need to do. And allowing them to become a much bigger deal than they actually are serves only to damage your confidence.

Don't be too afraid to make a fool out of yourself to act. At the end of the day, nobody really cares. Just like you don't.

I found comments on an [old blog post](http://zentransformation.blogspot.com/2008/05/short-public-service-announcement.html) by Ciaran (creator of the famed Apocalypse Opener) when he decided to quit RSD. He's way too dramatic in his woe-is-me writing style, but he did sum up some thoughts that I have had for a long time now.

---

&gt; You have sex with a random chick, and get that 'hit' of feeling like the fucking man because you just fucked a random chick. And you do it again, and again. And again. And again. 

&gt; And then you meet some girl you really like - which is the reason most guys get into this - and you get into a relationship with her. And you have sex.

&gt; And after about a month, you've fucked her every way a woman can be fucked. You've done everything to her that you can do. And no matter how hot she is, you cannot get that ""yeah, I just fucked a hot chick"" buzz off her anymore. 

&gt; Incidentally, this doesn't happen slowly. It is rapid. You rapidly lose interest in sex with her because she isn't giving you that ego hit anymore. Sex becomes a chore - but you don't stop caring about the girl. You just lose her.

&gt; You see, what would normally replace that ego hit - that sex would be a deep and mutually connective and loving experience - just isn't there for you anymore because you have conditioned your mind to equate sex with victory.

&gt; And realise that you cannot just ""flick a switch"" and turn off how your mind views sex. You can't stop it. You're just living in that place.

This post is dedicated to all of you who will become good at seduction and who sleep with lots of girls. With great power, comes great responsibility.

**NEVER lose sight of your original goal.**

**I repeat: NEVER lose sight of your original goal.**

If you get into this because you want to develop deep connections with women and find that someone special to settle down with, you MUST be proactively developing connections with people around you.

It's entirely possible to sleep around and develop deep connections with people. I've successfully done this, along with plenty of guys.

But I've also spent years developing an inner strength that allows me to do this. If you rush into success with women, like Ciaran, it can truly bite you. He valued the pursuit of sex over all other goals and it left him a shell of a man incapable of keeping women in love with him. He realized he was on a path towards eternal infidelity and unhappiness and quit the game. He forgot his goals.

Just keep your original goal in mind at all times. Random sex is fantastic (lol who am I to judge!) but if it's real connections you want, you MUST be out cultivating real relationships.

The attraction phase of seduction gets the most discussion because it is the point where most guys struggle with the most. But it's the comfort phase where real connections take place. Don't ignore it if building real connections is your goal.

If you are unsure of what your goals are - what your VALUES are - you have some deep introspection to do. You are never going to be a truly awesome creature if you do not understand your values. This is quoted directly from my post on the [8 characteristics of a Modern Alpha Male:](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/)

&gt; You have meditated and thought about your deepest inner values. You are unwavering on these. These can include things as basic as love of life, traveling, studying, religion, or not tolerating condescension or self-defeating behavior. These are the basic pieces that make up your personality and it is important to know what they are. The average, beta male has trouble describing his personal values to others. He looks to others to define who he is. This will not be you. YOU will define who you are. Nobody else.

So I was bored and alone last night, I decided to doll myself up and head to the club. I was in a DGAF mood which probably helped the night alot.

I decided that I was going to try something completely new and retarded. I was going to go up to every girl, give her some stupid compliment followed by ""we should fuck""

""Hey what's your name""

""Hey! I'm lisa""

""I like your name lisa, we should fuck""

""Eww you're such a perv!""

""Your loss lisa"" - wink at her and move on

**Second girl I approached was a smoking hot russian looking blond HB9**

""Hey I like your shoes, they really accentuate your hands""

At which point she has a complete ""WTF face"" going on, looking at her shoes and hands.

Her ""Excuse me??""

""I said I really like your eyes, they bring out your feet""

At this point shes really confused but smirking/giggling. I love it.

""What's your name?""

**""I'm Isabella""**

**""Nice to meet you Isabella, I'm batman""**

Her ""Are you fucking crazy or retarded?""

""Which one's more fun in bed? That one""

Her ""Where do you get all of this?""

""I'm a natural, what can I say. You know what we should do?"" At this point I'm playing with her hair

""Her ""What?""

""We should totally fuck and make a bunch of ridiculously good looking babies""

Her ""Woah woah woah slow down I don't even know your name""

""I'll tell you my name in the heat of the moment, it'll be more memorable that way"" I say this with the biggest smile on my face, she loves it

Her ""Well I tell you what, my girlfriend's in the washroom puking her guts out so I have to take her home, so not tonight""

""Ok well you should give me your number because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity""

She gave me her number and we parted ways. **She asked me to give her my number also but I declined and told her she'd know it's me when I call her. I'm going to call her and tell her it's batman lol.** Really cool chick with a great sense of humor.

After I finished talking to HB9, I realized that the HB8 from earlier (who called me a perv) was eyeing me talking to her the whole time. So after HB9 leaves, HB8 comes up to me and out of nowhere grabs me and kisses me. I dont even know what the hell happened, my guess is that she got jealous that I was having such a good time with a better looking chick.

My heart is pounding, and she’s only been sitting there for 10 seconds. I never used to get an adrenaline rush like this before I began learning what I know now. I guess the newfound confidence comes at a price. Or maybe this is my brain just telling the new me how to act, like my heart thumping is supposed to be telling me that the right thing to do is to just go and tell her what you think. It’s not a bad thing, just a new impulse I haven’t grown accustom to yet.

So, how can I remedy my adrenaline? TALK TO HER. Well, maybe I will. Maybe I’ll walk up to her, as I’ve done before, and tell her how I have a thing for girls with red hair and that she totally fits the bill. I’ll ask her for her name and what her story is. She’ll tell me about how she’s in school for a passion of hers, and I’ll tell her how it means a lot to me when people are passionate. Or, she’ll tell me she’s doing some mundane job, and I’ll ask her if she’s happy and try to offer new perspective. I will find out, “who is this beautiful stranger?” And I will put the two of us in a bubble for a moment in time, which if I’m lucky enough will be enough time for us to connect on a deeper level, and then we may meet again.

But then you begin making excuses. She’s wearing headphones and we’re on a subway car. Who knows how far she’s going? Maybe she doesn’t want to talk. Not that I care if anyone sees me try, but I don’t want to be disturbing to others. Do I look okay? There’s no way she doesn’t have a boyfriend! But I’ve been taught that it’ll only take a couple if sentences to pull her out of her reality and get her engaged in mine, that I possess all I need to have all I want. The pit in my stomach, the adrenaline, that’s why it’s there. It’s telling me “Connect. Meet. Learn, live.”

She’s getting up, she’s leaving the subway, and my heart is still pumping because I “almost did it”. Today, she has red hair. Tomorrow, she may have curly brown hair, or may be wearing a leather jacket, or have silky tan skin with a cute little birthmark to remind me that imperfections are to be loved. And maybe this time, I’ll approach her and tell her I think she’s the sexiest girl I’ve seen that day and that her birthmark is adorable. She’ll laugh in a moment of unexpected discomfort combined with a bit of intrigue an lust, wondering “Who is this man? How is he so bold? Can I trust him?” And I will be there to answer all.

Who is this man? One that is certainly centered, bordering on enlightened. Who’s passions, ambitions and sense of adventure guide his next decision almost without a thought. He knows and loves this about himself. How is he so bold? To which I will say, how couldn’t I be? If I weren’t, I would miss out on the chance to meet someone like you, and I don’t want to miss these connections anymore. Can I be trusted? Well, can anyone be trusted? Yes, they can, for every human anyone has ever befriended or loved was once a stranger. I’m just here to tear down the barrier, to make myself vulnerable in hopes that maybe you’ll do the same, so that we may connect.

The next day, I see her again, this time, she’s a short blonde girl. Frail and delicate. Thump, thump, thump. I feel another shot of adrenaline surge through me, telling me to meet her, ordering me to connect. No headphones, a moment of eye contact, and an open seat next to her. I commit myself, and begin walking to her, each step pumping more blood through my arteries. I sit down, I stare into her eyes, and all it takes is a simple “hello.” She smiles, and all the nerves melt away as we begin our journey.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_1a6am3,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1a6am3/ive_changed/,
1349725299.0,410,self.seduction,115itl,Guide to Living with Your Parents,522,112,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/115itl/guide_to_living_with_your_parents/,"I've seen a lot of users complaining that its hard to pull girls when you live with your parents. I've been doing this for about a year now, and have been doing it pretty well. Granted, I just live with my dad, so he has a litttle bit more of a life than a lot of parents, but the principles here are the same. Allow me to flesh out some key points: 


- **Respect your parents as adults, and they will respect you as one too.** I put this first because to me, its the biggest obstacle many people face. They treat their parents as ""parents"" - something in between adults and aliens. Treat your parents like adults who have social lives, enjoy conversation, enjoy company. Treat your parents as you might treat a guy or girl friend. Spend a night with them now and again, let them know what is going on in your life, ask what is going on in theirs. Go out and grab a beer with your dad now and again. Find the common interests you have and work with that. If you see your parents as adults and social beings, they will respond in turn. 

- **Embrace home living.** For whatever reason you stil llive at home (for me its that I'm moving to England, and needed some time to save some cash), embrace it. If there's no reason for you to be living at home, then you should probably think about moving. That said, if you're at home because you're really close with your family, say that. If you needed some time to get back on your feet after losing a job, own that. There's nothing inherently wrong with living at home. Sure, it COULD be construed as a DLV, but only if you let it. 

- **Let your parents know that you have a sexual life.** Yes, at times parents are going to judge a little bit. It happens. That said, if you make it clear and obvious at times that you are someone who enjoys the company of women and associates with them comfortably, your parents will come around to this. For example: when I first started pulling girls on a regular basis, my parent asked me what was up with the girls. I responded by telling it like it is: these are girls I'm seeing occasionally, but it's nothing too serious. Since then, I've had girls come over for ONS and crash at my place, with no parental imposition. I've also had girls show up to morning coffee with me, parent, and girl. When you are straight with your parents about your situation, they will almost always conform to it. 

- **Move your bedroom away from the same hall as your parents.** This should be relatively self explanatory. You need your space for yourself just as much as you do for women. If you want, move your room to a basement. Make an unfinished basement a little project for you. Basically, this requires you to have a little space to play, both yourself and with lady. 

- **Use the resources at your disposal.** Will most college-aged/twenty-something apartments have the kind of things that you and your parents have amassed over the years? Probably not. E.g. My house has a fantastic wok pan, and a great kitchen. If i lived on my own I could never afford any of this stuff, not to mention the atmosphere of a well stocked kitchen. Thus, I gear my game towards cooking for a girl if I have a night to myself. My house also has a tremendous library of music anda fantastic stereo system - do you think I use the iPod dock to play top 40 when a girl comes over? Not a chance. 

- **Take your opportunities WHENEVER they come.** Having the house to yourself, for whatever length of time, is an opportunity to game. Afternoon? Invite over for lunch and some tv/a movie. Evening? Invite over for a meal and a drink. Living at home means your opportunities are going to be a little more spaced out. So take them.  

- **Game will be slower - expect less ONS, but use this tension to your advantage** Home life has a built in tension factor - you can escalate and build attraction and excitement as much as possible OUTSIDE of the home, but sometimes living at home means there isn't a quick and convenient destination for sex. PLAY ON THIS. I have a girl friend of mine who is seeing a guy who lives at home. He is playing the tension built up by the fact that home doesn't always work for sex to perfection - he will send her little texts sometimes that are incredibly suggestive that when they have some time alone, he is going to stuff her like a christmas turkey. 

Some other little tidbits:

- Maintain a healthy relationship and understanding with any siblings. They let you have a night without them around, always repay the favour if applicable. Give them a $20 and treat them to a movie. 
- MAke your living space an adult living space, not your teenage bedroom. Get rid of the trophies and kid stuff. 
- Take everything you learn from having to game while living at home, and make sure to apply it alongside your freedom when you move out.

Living at home is not the death-knell for game. IF you own it, it is actually a benefit in some cases. Of course, if presented with the option of having sex at your house or the girls house, take the girls house. But DO NOT discount how effectively one can game while living at home.

**Background**

I went out with a girl for 2 years. It was my first serious relationship and it seemed great at the time. In the end I broke up with her and I felt fucking amazing. For a grand total of 2 weeks. Then it sunk in, the horrific feeling any guy knows once they break up with a girl they've been with for a while. I couldn't stop thinking about her and my god, my game was fucking destroyed. I literally forgot how to flirt. I'm sure seduction has a word for this, but I'll just call it post-relationship blues.

Started reading Seddit and started progressing. I was petrified on my first date. I was so scared I almost persuaded myself to go home. That date turned into a fuck buddy who I still see.

**Transformation**

Fast forward to now and I feel fucking amazing. I'm more successful than I've ever been. In the last 3 weeks I've had sex with two 8s and a 10. After having sex with the 10 I just had to tell Seddit. The stuff you read **REALLY** works. I'll save some of those stories for FRs.

I wanted to share the most important things I've learnt along the way:

* **Read Seddit** - Well done, you're already doing it. The amount of amazing advice on here is incredible. BUT, don't be afraid to try your own thing and don't ever think there's one way of doing something.
* **Go to the fucking gym** - You'll feel so much better seeing yourself improve. I started going 3 times a week. Looked up a good weights program and followed it. Your confidence goes through the fucking roof. Women now tell me on a day to day basis how good I look. That feels amazing.
* **Get a job you fucking enjoy** - If you have a stimulating job which you enjoy, you have a talking point. But most importantly girls LOVE a guy with ambition.
* **Speak to EVERYONE** - I can't stress this enough. My confidence levels went through the fucking roof as soon as I started speaking to everyone. Girl behind the till, waiter, randomers. Just fucking do it. You'll feel amazing.
* **Eye contact** - A great technique for improving confidence is looking at everyone you see walking down the street. ONLY break eye contact when they look away. It's fucking petrifying at the start, but slowly it builds up your confidence. Try it for a week and you'll feel amazing.
* **Read your favourite seddit post or seduction quote before you go out** - It's amazing how quickly you forget amazing pieces of advice or new things you want to try out. Read it before you go out, it helps you focus on what you want to achieve and helps you get in the right mindset. I have a doc with the things I'm trying out, or a great piece of advice I've recently read.
* **Have fun** - that's why you're reading this. You love seduction and you love women. At no point should it be a chore. You're seeing yourself improve all the time and trust me, the journey is fucking amazing.

Most importantly. **Just fucking do it.** Every post says it, but it's fucking true. There's only so much you can read. You learn from experience. Get out there, speak to women, get numbers, text them, date them, fuck them.

Thank you Seddit.

**TL;DR: I went from a harsh break up to being more successful than I ever have. I'm feeling the best I've ever felt through a transformation period of a few months thanks to Seddit.**

I like to floss in the shower. I'm weird like that. I get into the shower, I floss and I move onto the next step. The other day, I was feeling really lazy and decided to skip a day. Bad bad bad. Skipping a day flossing is not the worst thing in the world. But what it does is hugely problematic. Once I skip a day and its okay in my mind, flossing stops being automatic. I've broken my habit. Now, when I step into the shower, I have a huge question in my mind: Do I floss today or do I not floss today? 

It's good for me to floss every day. But would it be so bad if I flossed 6 out of 7 days? Probably not. I probably would not see a huge rise in my cavities. But you and I know, that's not usually what happens. 6 out of 7 days turns into 50% the days. And then all of a sudden, I'm flossing 1 out of 7 days. Or 1 out of 30 days. 

How did I go from skipping one day to flossing only once a month? It was because of that quick rationalization that it's okay to skip one day. Theoretically, it would be. But that one day causes an avalanche.

It's the same thing for me with going out and talking with women.

There is a cost for me when I go out to meet women. I'm old. I get tired from walking around. If I'm going to be seeing a woman tonight, I'm tempted to just skip it for today. But what happens? Tomorrow I'll have an even better reason to skip it. I won't feel right. Or the weather will suck. My brain is good at coming up with a million reasons not to do something. 

And the worst part about this is that it was once automatic. Now it's a chore. Getting up and going out has now become something I need to think about. I agonize over it. It takes a ton of mental energy.

The truth is, if you've got a habit in place...

**You should be scared to death of missing a day.** 

And if you don't have a habit in place, the quickest way to get one is to not let yourself miss a day. Even if it's pouring rain, I still go out and take a walk around the local supermarket and talk with someone. Even if I feel like crap. Just so I don't miss a day. 

The habit is more important than what you accomplish. Because without it, you soon won't accomplish anything at all.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_spw6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/spw6n/100_is_easy_99_is_a_death_trap/,

I am by no means an expert on any of these things, my interpretation of how these things relate has really helped me, and I hope others can get something out of it as well.*

**Behind the scenes**

Your brain is a lazy asshole. Its only objective is to conserve as much energy as possible, and work on making sure things are going well in the short term. The very short term.

This is why it seems to make more sense to skip the gym, eat a box of cookies, sit on the couch, and watch TV or play video games, than do anything else. It's easy, and you're conserving energy. You're not going to be winded and tired if you don't go to the gym. Those cookies might not be healthy, but they sure are delicious - and they're packed full of calories so you have some *backup* backup energy reserves stored up.

This isn't your brain's fault, it's a matter of evolution. When it takes work to get your next meal, it makes sense to eat as much and do as little as possible.

**The Problem**

This carries over into every other facet of your life. Your brain is great at convincing you that what it wants is what YOU want.

""If you talk to that pretty girl, you might get rejected - isn't it much easier to just not approach?""

""Wouldn't you much rather sit at home than go out? It's been a long week, you're tired, it's expensive to go out... this will be easy.""

Now you're overweight, unhappy, socially stunted, and lonely. You could take responsibility for this, and totally turn things around, but it's going to require a lot of work, a lot of time, and effort.

This is when your brain comes back and says ""but you're a great guy! It must be everyone else's fault! They don't give us a chance! They're biased against us because of ______. Guess we're going to be forever alone, but it's not so bad, we have each other - and Steam and that gigantic tub of ice cream!""

**GET OVER IT**

I could say people just need to man up, get over themselves, go out more, and just grow up. Really, this is true, but it's not very useful advice. Your brain is going to work against you at almost every step. How can you overcome this negative self-talk?

**Perception**

There's a concept in Buddhism called ""dependent arising."" The basic concepts around this are (1) everything is a result of cause and effect and (2) ""self"" only exists in dependence upon causes and conditions.

Both of these points are very valuable to us. The first point is pretty straight forward and helps emphasize one of the main beliefs held by our community - if you're happy, then you're doing it right; if not, then something needs to change.

The second point is more complicated, and can be difficult to understand. What is 'self'? Is it your body? Is it your mind? Is it some combination of the two?  

Well, it can't be your body. You shed cells every second of every day, and every 7 years every cell in your body is different than it was 7 years ago. If you lost your arm in an accident, you'd still be YOU, right? Even your brain is made up of cells that are made up of elements that are made up of atoms made up of quarks made up of energy. Bits and pieces that could have been rabbits, or trees, or air, or stars, before they were repurposed into you.

What about your mind, then, your thoughts? Well, sometimes I change my mind about things - either I learn something new, or find out something wasn't true, or my opinion simply changes over time. If I define who I am by beliefs that I hold, and those beliefs change, then I guess I'm not ME anymore? That doesn't make any sense. We're pretty complicated, but we're never surpised when our thoughts or feelings change.

So if it can't be the body, and it can't be the mind, then what is our sense of self?

**Thinking**

Thoughts are a lot like carbon dioxide molecules - they're around us all the time, they are necessary for life, and if there are too many they can incapacitate you.

There was a relevant quote in /r/meditation the other day:

&gt;Suffering is caused by compulsive thinking. We get lost in thoughts, we identify with them; we ""think"" we are our thoughts. They are incessant and quite often negative, and they create anxiety, stress, and the problems of everyday life.  
&gt;You can break your identification with compulsive thinking, however. You can increase awareness that you are not your thoughts. Consider your senses: your brain processes the inputs of the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the skin. But, you don't think that you are what you see, what you hear, what you smell, what you taste, or what you touch. View your thoughts the same way - your brain processes them, and you use those you need to solve problems and function in your daily life. But the thoughts you don't need - those that are negative, limiting, critical, and destructive - you simply let float away.  
&gt;Treat non-useful thoughts like undesirable smells: don't dwell on them, don't identify with them, don't get attached to them, don't get lost in them - simply let them float away.

This is where meditation can be a great ally in the war against thinking.

You sit, you live in the present, you acknowledge thoughts as they pop into your mind, then you let them go. This is easier said than done, and it takes practice, but that's really all there is to it. In the activities post from earlier in the week a lot of people said that meditation didn't stick, that it was boring, or even they did it for months but never had that ""AHA!"" moment where everything in their lives changed. OF COURSE NOT! If it's boring, it's because you're thinking about what you could be doing, or would rather be doing, or you're thinking that it's boring. There is no ""AHA!"" moment in meditation - some days are better than others and you sit for a long time with only a handful of thoughts that pass immediately, other days your mind is racing a mile a minute and everything you can possibly think about is going to run through your head and it's harder to let those thoughts go.

But once you do, you are living in the moment. You're not worried about what's going to happen later tonight, or if you're going to say the right thing, or if that HB really likes you. You're not judging yourself, you're not even judging others. Better yet - you don't even care, because you aren't thinking about it. You are just existing, enjoying being alive. If you've ever opened a set, had a good time, then when you walked away went ""whoa... how did I just pull that off?"" you know what I'm talking about.

If you tend towards thinking way too much, like me, it can be terrifying at first. You almost feel like you weren't there anymore, like you had an out of body experience. But the more it happens, the more you realize how liberating, how amazing, how wonderful it is - and you start to get to know the real you.

**Self**

And that's the real you, that sense of self we've been trying to find - it's everything and nothing all at once. That you isn't scared or nervous - it's your scumbag brain that makes you scared and nervous. You always say the right thing, because there is no wrong thing to say - it's your scumbag brain that stops you before you speak, or makes you comb over every word after the fact trying to figure out where you screwed up.

You're not too introverted, or too shy, or uninteresting, or boring, or ugly, or stupid; that's all your scumbag brain. You just *are*.


**Conclusion**

Your brain doesn't care about you. Whether you are happy, well adjusted, and enjoying life or depressed, emotionally damaged, and sitting at home alone every weekend, it makes no difference to your brain as long as it gets what it needs to survive. Excuses and negative thoughts are your brain's way of controlling you, and it's amazing how much power most of us give it.

Wanting to change is not enough, and it's never a good time to start, you just have to start.

So the next time you say you're going to start exercising, or eating better, or talking to women, or doing something that interests you, and you hear that little voice trying to convince you otherwise, ignore it and go about your life.

Make physical contact very early in your interaction with a girl. The easiest way to do this is to touch her on the shoulder or arm to get her attention.

The reason you need to make contact early on is because those first few moments set up the frame for the rest of your interaction. This is where you’re establishing the rules for how you and the girl will interact. If there’s no contact at all, even if the conversation is going great, when you go to initiate kino 30 minutes in, it’s going to be awkward, all the attention will be on it, and it’s like you’ve just smashed through a plate glass window.

On the other hand, if you initiate kino from the start, now your interaction is one where light physical contact is the norm and completely acceptable. Your next contact will not be nearly so awkward, if it’s even awkward at all. Don’t wait too long to kino a second time though, because the parameters of your interaction can change. Go too long with no contact and that wall starts to get built up between you. Early and often.

**How the heck do you do this?**

Many guys complain that they just don’t know how to kino, and that it’s always awkward, even if they do it right from the start. The only cure for this is experience. The first time you ever kiss a girl it’s going to be weird and you’re not going to do it very well. There is no amount of reading you can do that will prepare you though, you just have to learn what it’s supposed to feel like and become comfortable through experience.

If you need a crutch to facilitate kino, there are a lot of routines where physical contact is integral. Palm reading is a good choice, if you’re in to giving girls chick crack and can take yourself seriously while doing it. Another option is learning a few magic tricks, as there are a lot that involve placing something in a girl’s hand, or moving her hands around for any number of reasons — “Hold your hands outs. …No, like this,” and you move them into the correct position.

And of course, high fives. Always an easy go-to move. The trick is (for some reason I don’t understand) to look at the person’s elbow. You’ll never miss.

**Don’t be needy**

Not being needy is just a great rule for life, but it is especially relevant to kino. It’s easy to get way too excited about finally being able to touch a girl, and you just want to escalate, escalate, escalate. You haven’t touched a girl in forever, so you’re trying to get in as much contact as you can. You’re like a camel filling up on water at an oasis, and the girl will definitely pick up on this. Once she realizes that this is a novel experience for you, you’ll have exposed your low value, and she’ll be turned off.

Treat kino as an opportunity for push/pull. When you kiss her, be the one to break it off. End it while she’s still wanting more, talk for a while, and then kiss her again a few minutes later. This sends two messages; first that you’re not desperate for a little action, and second that you’re actually interested in her as a person. Every girl knows that you want to kiss her, what she’s hoping is that you’ll also want to talk to her after. So talk to her after.

**Proximity matters**

Think about standing close to each other as a form of kino. You will occasionally have some light bumps in to each other, and you can pick up a lot of cues based on how she responds to that. Does she move away so that you don’t accidentally touch again? Or does she stay right where she is?

You’ll also build a lot of sexual tension just by standing very close. Even without contact, she’s aware of your body’s presence, can feel the heat coming off you, and it’s almost like a static charge begins to build up.

I’m recently single for the very first time since highschool so I have absolutely no clue what the norm is. I’m completely oblivious to guys hitting on me. I get calls like 3 days later from my friends while doing the dishes just to realise that, that guy from sat night that’s been texting me, didn’t invite me to that new restaurant just to check out if it was good or not. Now that I think about it I dunno whether that says more about him than me.... But. Anyway...

I found this subreddit. And, after realising that it’s basically for PUA whatever ding dong fiddly diddly, I started to get a bit jealous as to how much fun that sounds.
After a bit of digging, I found there are PUA style tips specifically intended for women. But...

First of all, there’s not much out there for us tbh and, secondly,  most of them were basically “Show interest  by making eye contact and smiling”. I was disappointed but I'm still on holiday and I have a lot of free thinking time. So I wondered...

**What if? I applied ALL of the male tips? And used it. On guys. Would they be intimidated? Would I come off as desperate? Masculine?... hmm... Fuck it. I decided to test it**

Step 1: Look dashing. Cool and classy as fuck yet casual. (Bitch, I went shopping for this)  
Step 2: Go out. Proceed to interact with strangers.

What follows is a generalised summarized transcript from recollection of a small sample. I tried direct approach, on the street, whilst holding my phone on my hand to look busy. I’d walk past them, hold my phone against my shoulder and proceed like this:

**Me**: Hey..Hi..Sorry, I  just walked past you and I thought you looked really beautiful and just wanted to say Hi.  [*Yeah. I said beautiful. I fiddle with my phone really quickly, looking at him in intervals, to turn it off or something while he answers...*]  
**Hims:** *Laughter* Well, thank you very much. You’re very beautiful yourself.  
**Me**: You’re welcome. [*I put phone away. Go for a hand shake.*]  I’m forgetitok btw.


[Fast forward]  
10 #close of which 2 Insta dates.  
The first one was ok, lasted about 15 minutes before I exited with an excuse. The second one lasted a lot longer, like an hr and half. But roughly about 10 minutes into our date thingy... this:

[...]  
**Him**: So how often do you kidnap men from the streets luring them in with a cold beverage?  
**Me**: This week? Pff - I dunno, I’d have to count all those bodies in my basement.  
**Him**: Ha. [*grin*]  I like your banter.  
**Me**: That’s probably because you find me attractive. [ *I shudder in my head and try not to laugh after realising how cringe worthy that sounds when actually said out loud*]  
**Him**: Ha [*shit eating grin*] Even though you’re very right... I did not stop you in the middle of the street to tell you that you’re beautiful.  
**Me**: Haha Don’t beat yourself up. There’s plenty of time to make up for that.  
**Him**: Don’t worry I will. I would not want to take a risk and end up in your basement...  
**Me**: Hm [*shit eating grin*] You sure?  
[...]

I really don’t know what to think about this particular interaction. It’s like we were both doing the same thing, and by the end I could almost feel the tables turning. Also, I didn’t want to seem too creepy.
So, yeah... I dunno if I like this guy (Who btw is so out of my league) or If I’m just really excited that it all worked out.

Now... I know that **the main difference between male and female pua styles is the goal in mind**. And I know that men are generally swimming against the tide to get an F-close. But today I realised I had a fucking jetski. I still want to do it but it takes the whole fun out of it. So I dunno, I feel like when I chat guys up they automatically think that's where I want to go. Which I don't blame them for. I feel like I'm playing with th-- OOOOOOHHHH ""player""...sorry, I'm literally typing out my thoughts as they come along, realising stuff. 
Another interesting thought: if I make talking/#closing/f-closing my intention from the get go, I don't have that much problem fighting that ungodly anti slut thingy in my brain. ...Wait... is that a good thing? Aw shit. I’ll try not to think about it too much. Maybe all these things are already a given. I just haven't had experience being single really.

Either way. I’m going to keep doing this. It’s hella fun. It's making me think a lot. I'll do an indirect approach next time. Maybe add some challenges. Like a lisp or a limp.

I'm really interested to know what you think, any extra tips, ideas, or whatever. 

I just wanted to share this cos it was pretty awesome.

**Edit: for the ""This is clearly Bullshit. All she has to do is open her legs and she'll get it"" thinking crowd:  
1)My goal is not an F-close. I could. But doesn't have to be.   
2)I WANT to be picky. In fact, I have to, to avoid your kind.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Read Twice.   
3)I'm only average looking.**

2) For the ones that do, confidence really is key. For example, when I got her number I kissed her on her cheek. She smiled, and asked why I did that, and I said, ""Because I wanted to."" She smiled, and said, ""That was different.""

3) Be different, but be you. Don't be afraid to be who you genuinely are - I happen to be a raunchy person - and if you're trying to meet the right one (note: I am trying to meet my next girlfriend) you have to be who you are. 

4) Don't use canned lines, in fact, say something random. My opener? ""Hey, so I hear there are vampire women running around tonight."" It was the first thing out of my mouth, and I went with it while smiling.

5) Smile - you can say stupid shit and it appears joking, you can flirt and seem more flirty, you can smile to be friendly and convey interest.

6) Actually **be interested** in her. Girls know when you're pulling an act on every girl you see, so make her feel special as they want to feel this way (and want to know you can pull another girl). [Check this out](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14lw85/coaching_review_day_game_with_pua_coach_artisan/c7f89bw) for more proof.

7) Get to know her, and have some standards, and don't just accept her because she has a vagina. Call her on shit, laugh AT her, laugh WITH her, ask questions, tell stories.

8) Be normal - seriously, don't act, don't think about all the rules of seduction. Just own it, and be who you are.

9) Practice - getting over approach anxiety, and seeing success, and having things come natural to you are a direct feedback of this and rule number one.

10) The power of touch - if a girl touches you, it makes you feel something, right? Well, so do men to girls - harness that sexuality and use it without being a fucking pervert.

11) The power of rapport - women are ingrained with the idea that men are malevolent creatures who can hurt them. Making them comfortable is, arguably, even more important than flirting with clear intention. Why? Because by talking to a girl you don't know they CLEAR AS DAY know why you're there. Just as you would never meet up with a salesman who seems like he's only trying to benefit himself, you want to be the person who makes them feel comfortable. A salesman who makes you feel comfortable and makes you feel like they're not trying to trick you will get the sale.

12) DON'T FUCKING OVERANALYZE. This is the WORST mistake you can make. It'll mess you up completely.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1363502798.0,,,True,t3_1agc3k,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1agc3k/extremely_valuable_lessons_i_learned_tonight/,

I can't believe I'm doing this. This is my god damned baby.

Ladies and Gentlemen of r/seduction, I introduce to you a top-secret, never-heard-before, **field tested waaaaay over 20 times,** daygame/nightgame opener.

This is PERFECT for those times when you see a girl sitting alone, on a bench, at a bus stop, on the train, at the bar... wherever.

Normally it'd be a bit awkward to sit right next to her, especially if there are many open seats in the surrounding area. The Solution:

——————————————————

**SAY THIS:**

*So, you know how everyone has a social bubble? Like if you get within three feet of someone else, they'll start to feel uncomfortable?*

*Well, bubbles are different based on culture. In North America, we have massive bubbles, ‘cause everyone is afraid of touching the other person and no one wants to get sued.*

*But in South America, bubbles are a lot smaller, because the culture is more open and receptive to human contact.*

*So if you put someone from north america in the same room as someone from south america, and get them to start chatting, the south american will continually move into the north american's bubble.* 

*The north american then feels uncomfortable and backs away. Which makes the south american uncomfortable, causing the south american to move forward.*

*So as they're talking—and neither of them are aware of it—they're doing a little dance around the room.*

—————————————————

And that's it. That's my baby. I've used this over and over and over again. 

Why is it so awesome?

When you plop down right next to a girl, she's going to feel anxiety – especially if there are a bunch of empty seats around her.

And how do we get rid of anxiety? **We bring it into the real world.**

Immediately, you're bringing the base discomfort out into the open. Not only that, but you're also looking like a sharp dude.

If you sat down and said some other opener, once you finished she’d still be thinking “what’s this dude doing sitting next to me again?”

Also, this story shows how stupid social bubbles are in the first place. So you will both realize how stupid social bubbles are and forget about them as soon as the story is finished. You can then talk about how silly it is that north americans are so cold to touching, which helps you progress into physical escalation.

Lastly, this is very easy to remember and lasts long enough that once it's finished, the ice will be broken. I usually follow up with, ""Hi, I'm X.""

Then you progress as normal.

Enjoy you bastards, and I swear to god, if I ever get ""I've heard this before"" from a nice young woman, I will smite this community with fire and lightning.

I'm a guy in my early 30's, and up until the last couple months I've mostly been involved with / looking for younger women.  While I've met with success (I don't look/act 'older'), the hassle and drama that go along with that crowd was grating on me.  After reading someone's post on Seddit about older women, it occured to me that maybe I ought to actually look in my own age range, and so I decided to put up a profile on OKC (using advice from Seddit on what makes a good one) and see what happened.

I was, frankly, shocked at how successful it was.  As in, I actually now have to juggle dates, and texting/phonecalls from multiple women at the same time - I usually only dealt with 1 or 2 at a time before - and, while these women are generally a bit reserved at first, once you get past their initial defenses, they're wild and enthusiastic lovers.  So thank you to everyone on here who posted suggestions, you've greatly improved my personal life!

In the interest of giving back a bit, there's a few tips I have in dealing with OKC specifically (but they might apply to online game in general), just from my experience:

* **Women won't always (often) make the first move.**  If a woman has viewed your profile, and you like the look of her, *send a message*.  Worst case, it goes nowhere.  However, the amount of 'Oh, I saw your profile and hoped you'd message me' replies I've gotten *once I initiated contact* have been astounding.

* **You must, must MUST know how to have a conversation.**  'Hey girl, U be hawt' is most assuredly NOT going to cut it.  If you want women that will just jump in bed with you for your abs, get back to the clubs.  Online, all you've got at first is your verbal game.  Polish it.  Even if it's a turd, get out the cloth and shine that shit up real good.  You'll be better than 80% of the guys out there already just by putting in minimal effort.

* **Escalate quickly** - meaning, send a couple back and forth messages, and then suggest moving the conversation to text and/or voice.  I tend to tell women that I'm busy with work and so not home a lot (which is true), and that if they want to get ahold of me more reliably, or get faster responses, they're better off communicating directly.  It's a more 'intimate' way of interacting, and I've often found that a nice polite woman in online messages turns into a risque seductress trying to get me to want her (ah the irony) fairly quickly after we transition to text, or voice chat. Protip: If you can get them to call you late at night, even better, for obvious reasons.

* **Watch out for crazy** There are some (small percentage) of women on there who simply can't get a guy in any normal way, and are looking for a meal ticket for their 5 children in their crappy home.  It's a sad stereotype, but it exists.  Just use your brain and you can avoid being caught in an awkward situation.

* **Do not pretend to be someone you're not in your profile** You're going to come across as confident, intelligent, and in no way an AFC in your profile and conversation.  You had better be able to demonstrate the same qualities in person, or the lady in question is just going to feel *very* awkward and want to get away quickly.  No one likes feeling lied to, so make sure you can back up your talk.  I've heard so many tales by this point of 'Oh, I'm glad you're the same you were online', because lots of guys act one way there, and then are total socially awkward penguins in person.

Anyhow, sorry for the wall of text, but I'm psyched, happy, and appreciative of you guys! Thanks, Seddit!

##Teasing##

*****

  This may help: [“3 Rules I Live By”]( http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/rmxm8/3_rules_i_live_by_everyday/)
 
In order to pull teasing off effectively, you need to have _confident body language, smile and make plenty of eye contact_.  

When you tease, say it in a very ""tongue-in-cheek"" style. She needs to know that you're intending to be humorous. Otherwise she'll take you seriously and you'll blow yourself out.
    

 
**Teasing is used to:**  

1. Establish frame control, e.g., making yourself the prize, deal with AMOGs.  

2. Build rapport/comfort – Teasing is something people do when they’ve known each other for awhile.  

3. Establish Value – People only tease people of equal or lesser value than themselves.  

4. Create Push-Pull , e.g., Qualifiers and Disqualifiers.  

5. Produce shit tons of Callback Humor, which should be taken advantage of for the first call/text.  

6. **Teasing** (as opposed to its uglier cousin, bullying) **implies that**:
     1. You're not going to put her on a pedestal. You're a confident person, not a yes-man. That's attractive.
     1. You've noticed (or made up) her imperfections, and they're not a big deal. Then, she feels more comfortable being herself around you.
     1. You're a funny person who is comfortable pushing conversational boundaries. This is sexy. (credit chris5100)

 
###OTHER NOTES!!!

  1. (**!!!**) Remember, constant teasing and nothing else will lead to people to detest you, and girls will be convinced you're an asshole.  
  2. It's not what you say, it's how you say it.
  3. You don't need to use that many of these. At all. Seriously.  
  4. If you think these are too mean, it's probably because you're saying them wrong and/or you are a boring person. Put a smile on.   
  5. I use these at house parties. It may work at clubs (I don't game there much at all, too difficult to talk and show what kind of person you are.) or bars.^__(CAREFUL)__

  1. __[On Calibrating Teases](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/sv7tk/a_not_so_quick_guide_to_teasing_pt_1/c4hau8e)__

*****
 
1.	**Be enthusiastic. First and foremost.**
    1.	Be loud. LOUD. 
    3. HAVE FUN, EVERYTHING IS A JOKE!
    2.	Exaggerate. A lot. Avoid sounding try hard.
    3.	If you give shit out, learn how to take it. The best way avoid being insulted/getting burned is to **agree and amplify**. If someone calls you a faggot, respond happily with “You interested?” ;) or “I’ll suck your dick so dry, and use a lot of teeth.”^__(CAREFUL)__ A girl calls you an asshole, either make a scene about it by starting a fake fight or agree with her. “I know, I’m pretty much the world’s biggest asshole. You should probably not talk to me.”
    4.	Make a scene about things.
    5.	Don’t be monotone, vary your tone. Speak, with, pauses. Use commas, just wherever, when you're talking if you do, in fact, have problems slowing yourself down.
    6.	Careful with making the conversation sexual; use more blunt sexual teases when no one else is listening.
    7.	Don’t joke or tease too hard while the conversation is on something serious.
    8.	Learn what vocal inflections work for you voice and style.
    9.	Watch for reactions (without seeming reaction seeking). If her body language &amp; mouth both are locking up, chances are you went too far.
    10.	Make sure never to genuinely offend someone. If you do, apologize by saying either “I like a woman who can joke rough.” Or “My friends/family and I use teasing as a form of endearment.” 
    11.	Either of those should be followed by, “I apologize, let’s start over.” 
    12.	Ask a simple, logical question to distract (damage control): “Where are you from?””What do you do for fun?”
    13.	If there’s resistance, back up, regain composure, go SOFTLY back into it.^__(CAREFUL)__
    14.	Tell a woman, if she sits near you at the bar: ""Out of all places in the bar, you chose to stand by me and you don't even have the courage to introduce yourself.""
    15.	 ""You’re totally checking me out...Aren't you?""
    16. (**!!!!**) Use lines from movies/tv/standup bits. I like using Louis C.K. lines. ""Quit being such a faggot. Not like a homosexual. You're just being a... faggot."" ""I would never use that word to describe a homosexual. Unless he said something like, *People from Phoenix are Phoenicians*, then I'd say quit being a faggot and suck that dick."" If she gets offended when you quote something, simply say where you quoted it from and state that you thought it was hilarious. You can transition from this by saying, ""It's funny what we as people find funny. So much humor is just so messed up."" This can get her talking for a bit and completely distract from the rude comment.



2.	**Start light, be playful with everyone.**
    1.	Ramp it up to bigger (more obvious) teases.
    2.	As you get to know her, slow down the frequency of teasing , but not to a standstill, teasing will help keep her around and interested. 
    3.	Laugh a lot, smile big, and tease everyone a little bit.
    5.	You won’t be obviously just going after her if you throw teases out to everyone. This will make her feel less singled out, therefore more comfortable with it. 
    6.	Teases towards female obstacles can create a jealousy plotline.  
    6. _Hug Test_: When she hugs you, give her a letter grade ""That hug was like a, ehhh, I'll say C-."" (Don't give her higher than an A-.)


2.	**Treat her like a little sister.**
    1.	If you don't have one (I don't) watch standup comedians talk about their younger sister or daughter, watch your friends with their sisters. 
    3.	Make fun of anything she messes up or that you can spin it to make her look silly.
    4.	Call her names like sweetie, honey, babe in a sarcastic (possibly a little endearing) way. “Calm down sweetie, I’m not that easy.”
    5.	Call her names like Goober, knucklehead, butthead (always gets a good laugh) .etc. (*accentuate the fact that these are lame, that's the point*)   
    6.  REMEMBER: Keep your voice inflecting up to sound playful. 
    6.  “You know what, you're being a fuckin' butthead!” (Mixing profanity levels is funny. Drop your arms like you’re giving up on her, even walk away from her for a bit.)
    6.	When you’re walking with her, lightly push her TOWARD, (Don't hurt her) chairs, pillars, telephone poles. *Not into buses.*
     7.	 Personally, when you two are walking somewhere, I really enjoy putting my arms straight down and walking right into her so I push her with my arm and body into stuff.
    8.	(**!!!**) Qualify her by teasing. “You look/seem like you could be the world’s biggest Hanna Montana fan.” “I’m sure there’s more to you than meets the eye, what music are you actually into?”
    9. When she's taking herself seriously and/or in a position of power, telling you about it/showing off: Grin and say, ""Aw, how cute."" and proceed to act as if she's a 7 year old explaining her stuffed animal tea parties to you. (credit dablac)


3.	**Act like she always needs parental supervision.**  
    1.	Especially if she’s young.  ""You're such a little brat (laugh here to break tension if need be), am I going to have to go get a bottle of warm milk and put you to bed?""
    2.	""You're ridiculous.""
    3.	""You're too young to be drinking that!"" (Grab her drink, hold it high in the air so she can't reach it, do this only to girls you already have attracted, and not for very long, otherwise they can find it annoying.)
    4.	""I'm going to put you in timeout, little miss.""
    5.	Making plans: ""Okay so here’s the plan, I talked to my mom, and she said that she will drive you home if your mom brings you over. Sound good?"" ""We'll have to leave the door open though, my mom comes in every 10 minutes and does a hand check.""

4.	**Mock her, really, really obviously.**  
    1.	You can repeat her verbatim.^__(CAREFUL)__ 
    2.	 If she has a country accent, do an obnoxious country accent repeating what she said, or just sing about a tractor.^__(CAREFUL)__ (Qualify afterward with ""Where are you from?"")
    4.	Role Play: Act like a high maintenance girl. 
     5.	Fake fight over something emotional and really girly. Act offended, “We can’t talk anymore, I need space.”
     6.	If she calls you an asshole or makes fun of you: Overreact by freaking out “Fine! I see how it is!” (Storm off)
     7.	“You know what?! That’s it! We’re breaking up, give me back my cds.” “I’ll be excepting some child support.”
     8.	“Oh no. I think you got me pregnant…” (Blame sharing a drink, hug, kiss, even a handshake or thumb wars.)
    13.	Frame her as a stalker/creeper. “Don’t make me get a restraining order (again).” “Stop following me!” “Look, you gotta stop touching me so much, I brought my rape whistle just incase.” “You stay away from my swimsuit area.”

5.	**Misinterpret things she says and your environment in general.** 
    1.	This is so important because if you’re out of things to say, you can easily keep the conversation alive by turning what she says around. 
    2.	 She tells you where she’s from: “I hear people from there smell bad/are boring/tell terrible stories. 
    3.	Follow up statements in respective order: “Keep your arms down just in case.”/ “You aren’t boring, are you?”/ “Can you prove me wrong?” 
    4.	 Say she brings a drink back to the table or orders a drink in front of you: “Oh my, you shouldn’t have!”, “Thanks for the drink”.  
    5.	If her hair is curly: “I love straight hair!” (Or vice versa) while quickly and gently playing with her hair.

I was out with a group of friends I had known for a few years, one of them a girl I had recently begun hooking up with but no one else knew. The bars had closed and we were sitting on a curb just shooting the shit. I was rather drunk, but very focused on how I could separate her from the rest of the group and go back to my place. I knew she didn't want to make an obvious exit with me as the other girls may gossip about it, but it was clear she was in the mood. 

The gods of late night hookup were doing their best to prevent my success. Out of nowhere a monsoon-like rain hit the street, sending the group to a nearby covered patio for cover.  

It seemed hopeless. Now we were even closer in proximity to the group and an exit together into the rain in the direction of my apartment would be deciphered as nothing other than a move to late night sex. 

Then, somehow, someway the answer found its way into my inebriated skull. Without speaking, I took her hand and lead her out in the rain, to the middle of the street. The rain pelted us, and within a few steps I could already feel my shoes get heavy as they filled with water. When we reached the middle of the street, I turned and looked at her. She looked dumbfounded as to what was going on but before she could say ""What the fuck are you doing?"" I leaned in and kissed her. 

The kiss lasted only 45 seconds or so, but at that point we were soaked. Its the stereotypical, end of the movie kiss she sees in any rom-com, and now she experienced that in reality. After the kiss, there was about 10 seconds of silence and then I said ""Let's go home.""

As I left with her hugging my arm, I glanced over my shoulder at my friends still under the patio. They were all standing, watching as if it was some type of performance art. At that point, I don't think she cared that they saw us. Our cold drenched clothes came off immediately upon arrival to my room. When she woke me up before she left  the next morning, she said ""Making out in the rain? You're crazy."" My female friends texted me saying how it was the most romantic thing they've ever seen.

1334021983.0,399,self.seduction,s1tbl,For nerds only: steps to work on socializing with women.,477,78,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/s1tbl/for_nerds_only_steps_to_work_on_socializing_with/,"If you aren't a nerd, then this probably wont apply. If you don't know whether or not this applies, then I almost guarantee it will.  If you are like me and have the gift/curse of overanalysis, this is for you. If you feel even more socially inept than most, read on. If even talking to a female as a friend is confusing, keep going. Hopefully something below helps you out.

Most nerds strongest trait is their ability to analyze things on a very intricate level. But sometimes this is bad. Overthinking stuff sucks sometimes. Often, it doesn't help when you get around other people.  Our logic fails us with people time and time again. Sadly, we naturally tend to back out of certain situations because we can't comfortably analyse the situation. And, although we hate to admit it, we sometimes freeze up when the pressure is on, like a Microsoft blue screen. All this makes socializing, well, suck. If this sounds like you, below are some...affirmations, if you will to help you let go and get your swagger back. (Note: I feel a personal path is required for everyone. Some of this goes against somewhat popular beliefs, but only because my experiences say so. All i know is what's inside my head. Find your own strategy too and contribute.)

1) ""I am overthinking this."" Admit when you are. If you think you may be, you probably are. 

2) ""I trust my intuition."" Captain Kirk was a better leader than Spock. Spock was more intelligent, but Kirk had intuition. If he didn't trust himself, he would have never been Captain. For another example look no farther than a Jedi. Obi Wan taught Luke that in order to command The Force, he had to trust his instincts. You doing so will not allow you to pull a lightsaber out of a snow pile ten feet away, but it will get you a lot less stress in life and make you feel stronger and more complete. The road to confidence won't always be logically clear-cut. You'll just have to trust your gut sometimes. If you worry about doing the wrong thing, remember your intuition isn't intended to be correct, it's intended to give you a backup when logic fails, which leads to:

3) ""I do not know what the answer is, and that's okay."" This is HUGE. When you are talking to someone remember you are not quizing yourself. Many times, there is no obvious thing to say or do.  This is not an RPG with set paths. In reality, you don't actually know for 100% what anyone else is thinking or feeling, even when they tell you. Consequently you are not going to know if what you just said or did made them like you more or less, and 99% of the time you will never know. There is nothing you can do about it. I know this doesn't sound like an affirmation, but you'll find if you do it you'll feel a lot less pressure and relaxed. This is NOT an invitation to feel helpless or reckless. This is a way of liberating yourself from fear when in a high-pressure situation.

4) ""I am not expecting any specific result from this."" Similar to number 3, if you remove any expectations, you remove pressure. You'll feel a ton of weight off your shoulders when you have your first comfortable female interaction without feeling any agenda should be met. All of this is hard to do admittedly when you are horny lol, but oddly enough expecting a result is completely counterproductive. Why? I don't know, and that's okay. :-)

5) ""I am a nerd, and that's okay."" I am a nerd. My favorite TNG character is Data. I know what TNG means. I have an opinion on Visual Basic.  I think The Classic Avengers could beat Superman. I watch baseball for the statistics. I think the history of trains is fascinating. I do and say things that many women find unattractive. But I do them because I love them. And if you have passion for a certain hobby or activity, keep it at all costs. This is called integrity, and it's imperative to social confidence moreso than anything else I've encountered. You can cut out other unattractive things you don't really care about, but if you love doing something, do...period.

6) ""Get off the computer."" Thinking is no substitute for doing. This website can only give you 50% of what you need, which will not complete any mission. I'm not saying you should intentionally place yourself in high-pressure situations (it works for some, though), I just feel like we should make the most of the situations that come our way. But if you avoid social situations because they make you uncomfortable, experiencing that discomfort is imperative to overcoming it. Nobody said it would be easy, but...

7) ""This should be fun."" This is a learning process, like learning to write music or paint, though. It won't be fun at first when you'll feel limited. But having fun IMO should be the ultimate goal. If you focus on the process rather than the product every interaction has the potential to be a success. Otherwise you rely on someone else to determine your success, which is highly illogical. :-)

Okay. That's all I've got for now. I feel like everyone has to find their own way, so to help others feel free to disagree, agree or elaborate. ",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_s1tbl,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/s1tbl/for_nerds_only_steps_to_work_on_socializing_with/,

1351388983.0,396,self.seduction,127897,I'm going to try and break every limiting belief about your looks there is. Let's do this.,513,117,177,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/127897/im_going_to_try_and_break_every_limiting_belief/,"Okay, so this is something I've been planning on writing for a while but never really got around to it. I'm going to try and address all of your limiting beliefs about your physical appearance and your ability to attract women right here, right now. Ultimately, for you to subconsciously destroy that belief, you have to go out and get girls, but for many people (myself included), the crippling belief that you're just not good looking enough is enough to prevent you from trying it out at all.

So, as some background, I have been horribly insecure about my appearance for years. There was actually a period of 2 months where I would have a physical gag reaction to my looks. I used to have bad acne, buck teeth, major babyface -- girls used to call me ugly. Here's the funny thing: I'm not even bad looking. Quite the contrary, I'm a good looking guy -- not model material, but a guy that girls consider ""cute"". But because I *assumed* I was ugly, I never had any luck with women. Never had a girlfriend, had first kiss at 19 and it wasn't even a real one. It's only recently I've managed to bust past this horrible insecurity, and I'm going to try and help you do the same.

Alright, let's get to it.

**You don't know what is and isn't good looking. So stop trying.**

Many times on this sub-reddit, I would see someone post a picture of themselves and be told they're super good looking, when in reality they're not. I'm assuming you're a straight guy -- that means *you don't know what a good looking guy is*. You have a general idea of what a bad looking guy is, but often times men exaggerate shit that doesn't even matter.

Jawline is the main thing -- guys see a man with a sharp jawline and automatically assume he's hot shit. In reality, jawline doesn't necessarily define anything. A good example of this is Ryan Gosling, who has a very round jaw structure. See here: http://8.mshcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ryan-gosling-640.jpg

**Girls are SUPER different when it comes to tastes.**

This is something I only came to learn when I did a ton of research on it. I literally asked dozens of girls on their opinions of guys and people were overwhelmingly different. One of my friends thinks Ryan Gosling is not physically attractive at all. Another one of my friends says the same thing about Brad Pitt. One of my friends thinks J. Cole is the sexiest man alive... another of my girl friends is revolted by his appearance.

Guys don't understand this, because we aren't nearly as varied in our tastes. No straight guy on this planet is going to deny that Jessica Alba is attractive. Another thing is that girls have ""types"" -- types that they adhere REALLY strongly too. For instance, that same girl who likes J. Cole and is really into black guys/hip-hop personalities, doesn't find someone like Chris Hemsworth to be all that appealing to the eyes -- but a guy wearing hip-hop clothes immediately catches her eye. Types are a *huge* deal for girls, and assuming you dress well, you're almost guaranteed that there's some girls out there who find you hotter than some much ""prettier"" celebrities.

**Attraction simply isn't dependent on looks. At all.**

Okay, so this is the overriding point I'm trying to make -- that sexual attraction doesn't depend on your physical appearance nearly as much as your attitude. To do this, I'm going to use an example from the show *Community*. For those of you that don't watch it, Community is a sitcom starring a bunch of people at a community college. Among these people are two of the group's most attractive men, Jeff Winger and Troy Barnes. These are the respective actors playing these characters:

Joel McHale playing Jeff Winger: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6TKOJ0DA8ns/T_K0fEc0KkI/AAAAAAAAL3s/x6dz6ry9ShY/s1600/Joel-McHale-shirtless-6.jpg

Donald Glover playing Troy Barnes: http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Community+Red+Carpet+2010+Comic+Con+2tXLMQi0HKnl.jpg

Joel McHale is very traditionally good looking -- tall, blonde, ripped, high cheek bones, sharp jawline, great hair, etc. Donald Glover on the other hand is kind of funny looking... he's short, with a big head. Good looking certainly, but nothing very special. 

And yet equally as many women, if not more, like Donald Glover than do Joel McHale. Why? Glover is fun, has swagger and confident as sh*t. There's actually an askwomen thread about those two, and IIRC most of the girls picked Glover over McHale. If you go to r/ladyboners, you can see how much of a local favorite Donald Glover is there. He's a good looking guy, but he's not someone that's going to turn heads the moment you look at him -- but his attitude makes him insanely attractive.

Another example is Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's certainly a very good looking guy, but he's not a ""drop dead gorgeous"", eastern-European chiseled good looking guy... for example, like this (minus the hair): http://nymag.com/images/2/daily/fashion/08/05/12_jkortajarena_lgl.jpg

However, his attitude, smooth-ness, charm and style has made him one of the biggest sex symbols of this decade.

**Finally, it just doesn't matter.**

Look, we all know that looks don't matter to get hot girls into bed -- we've all seen the stories of ugly dudes getting girls in clubs. If you didn't believe it before, hopefully by now you've realized that it doesn't matter. You've seen plenty of PUA's like David-X who are just bad to look at pulling 10's on the regular basis. Charles Bukowski, the famous 20th century poet, had a hideous face scarred by cystic acne and medical testing that made him look like a buffalo (Google him if you don't believe me)... and yet he was so much of a womanizer that the show Californication was *based on his life*.

The problem is, for a lot of people like me, I always worried that my looks would stop me from getting the girl of my dreams. That if I met an amazing girl, a more handsome man would take him away from me. I spent ages trying to break through that thought pattern until I realized one thing -- *if someone doesn't want to be with you because your jaw isn't sharp enough, why would you want to be with them?* Picking the person you spend your life with based on their facial structure is absurd. 

At the end of the day, Jay-Z is with Beyonce not because of his money, but because he's got insane swagger -- and they both have incredible chemistry together. The fact that he's bad to look at and she's one of the most beautiful women on the planet doesn't matter one bit. The girl of your dreams will love you for who you are, not the shape of your face -- on one condition: **that you love yourself**.

So be your best self... become an amazing person. You'll get laid on a regular basis as many of the PUA's around here can attest, and when you finally meet the woman of your dreams, she'll come into your bubble of positivity and security and make a life with you (if that's what you want).

This has been a huge, painful journey for me to accept my appearance... hopefully my words here can help some of you. Best of luck, brethren.

EDIT: One last thing I should mention. I was talking to a girl friend recently, and she said something that stuck out: ""I wouldn't have sex with someone unless I had a *reason* too. If a guy is really pretty I'll be attracted to him... but I would still feel like I need some reason to allow him to get intimate with me, and that takes an interesting persona."" I don't know if all girls feel that way, but I suspect they do to some degree.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1351389425.0,,,True,t3_127897,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/127897/im_going_to_try_and_break_every_limiting_belief/,

I mean, the music is too loud to actually talk in a way for the girl to get interested, and the best you can hope for from dancing with them is some grind or if your lucky a make-out.
I really dislike it and don't understand AT ALL the attraction of it.
Maybe it may be the clubs I go to, or my bad experiences or inexperience/ lack of confidence.

But I really hate clubbing.
This was a little bit of a rant but would love to hear opinions, or even tips to gain some enthusiasm, or some strategies.

*Edit* Also as a side note, just a bout of insecurity. Does anyone find themselves constantly demoralised by the more outgoing guys, or guys who are huge and by all means are chick magnets. 

Of course all this indicates some lapse in inner game, but in a club with music pumping, you could know more than any other pua in the world, have the best inner game, but there is no way to communicate. 
And if some huge obnoxious bloke is waving his arms around and just cuts into a girl or group you might try to dance with, there is no way to out-alpha him except by dancing more wildly than him/or cut in front of him which by all means could start a fight. 
ITS JUST SO FLAWED.

As far as privacy goes, obviously you would have to withhold or change all names and locations, and any pictures you or her exchange.

On the one hand, it can be really fun when I'm with the right people, or by myself, because I get to go balls to the wall and I don't feel like I'm dragging deadweight.

**On the other hand, club game sucks if you are not there with the right people.**

If you plan on running game in a club, this is what works for me:

1. **You need to be in a crew of extroverts.** Sorry introverts, the club wasn't built for you - no harm, there are few lost opportunities that can't be made up elsewhere.
2. **Every single person in your crew must either have zero approach anxiety, or can at least ignore it with you and your friends' social momentum.** Be careful though, if their reluctance is so bad that it drains your own momentum, don't invite them to the club. They won't have fun, and neither will you.
3. **Have some good looking girls in your crew.** Don't tell me you don't know at least one 7+ girl who will go to a club with you. If you don't, you aren't ready to be running club game. They don't even have to be single, they just need to be seen with you.
4. **Dance with everyone. Talk with everyone.** Be seen - don't just stand around in one place in the corner. Move around and scope the place out, and more importantly, talk to one person in every room/area you end up in. Mystery peacocks for a reason - you don't have to wear a funny hat, but you sure as hell need to be in the social consciousness of people at the club.
5. **Don't underestimate lines - entrance lines, drink lines, bathroom lines, that is (queues for the brits)**. These are the most boring experiences that are part and parcel of being in a club. Be the group that makes being in a line fun, and you have a ton of cred going for you.
6. **The amount of kino that's acceptable on a dancefloor IF A GIRL IS VIBING YOU is hilariously high.** But, do not start at 11. Escalate, and don't be timid. If a girl is dancing with you, smiling, and laughing at your jokes, you should be escalating like you're trying to reach the moon.

So, I had to write this because I was at the club with my girl and our friends. Our crew is me, another guy, and seven girls.

Naturally, we're quickly surrounded by dudes who do everything BUT approach directly. 

Here are the common mistakes that they made (over and over) that you should avoid:

1. **Being seen standing around in the same spot for 20 minutes doing nothing and pointing, as if to say ""I want to approach but I'm scaaaaaaaared.""** I'm a dude and I thought that was weak/creepy. I was rooting for these guys to man up and swoop in. Didn't happen.
2. **When they DID make a move, they tried to approach the girls from behind. EVERY TIME.** What the fuck? Nothing says ""zero confidence"" like watching a girl from the front, then walking halfway around the dancefloor so that he can spend the next two minutes dancing closer and closer until they ""accidentally"" bump into one of my friends.
3. **Anytime you approach a girl and make like it was an accident and then try to finagle your way into talking to her, it will seem fake.** Unless you're really fuckin' good at acting. Hint: you're probably not. In which case you need to work on direct approach.

There was **one guy** who managed to k-close one of my friends, and got her number. However, she won't be going out with him. She says because he was boring. Even the kiss was boring (get good at this, by the way). Informative, I know. 

Don't worry, though - I got your back! I was keenly observing exactly what he was doing right, and wrong during the whole process, because my girl and I are into that kind of thing.

**Right:**

* Kino - this guy didn't have any qualms about it.
* Isolation - got our friend away from us with a cigarette break.
* Looks - he was a very put together guy compared to the others who were trying to break in.
* Conversation (?) - she spent a lot of time talking to him. That could be good or bad though.

Now... here's why he didn't get laid, and why she won't be answering his calls.

Wrong:

* Was seen orbiting - he was hanging near our group for a good 2-3 minutes before approaching. He at least approached directly, but before that he was just staring at us with his friend.
* Did not escalate - beyond basic kino, this guy wasn't stepping up his game on the dance floor. In fact, he looked extremely uncomfortable there the whole time. Don't be uncomfortable. If you're not a dancer or enjoy dancing, fine, but then you better isolate and come up with a more fun idea quick, and one where you can ramp up physical/sexual aspects of the interaction.
* Continued to orbit - never did this guy leave our friend's side for the entire hour leading up to last call. I mean, the isolation was a good call, but after they returned, he kinda just hung there looking awkward when she wasn't dancing directly with him.

For serious. If you are pussyfooting in a club, you will fail. Period. So, bring the right ingredients, and follow the three second rule. Being blown out is perfectly fine. Shit, take a month to get your first 50 blow-outs so that you get used to it. After you realize that all it means is ""no thank you,"" you can move on with your life and bang a whole bunch of chicks. Sometimes at the same time.

I'm hoping all those guys went home thinking ""damn, I knew I was taking too long/being too indirect/not having confidence. I'll do better next time!""",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_1ep0zz,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1ep0zz/more_club_advice_and_how_a_group_of_guys/,

That's it guys, that's all you have to say. However saying you are hot, wouldn't work that would come across of too sleazy, but saying ""you're pretty"" really appreciates her looks in a genuine, honest way. Every time I say this, the girls' eyes light up, they blush and they get a big smile on their face. It also alpha as fuck and clearly states your intentions, what you think of her and appreciates her sexuality.

If you're at a social event and not a party or a club, I would drop it after 30-60 seconds in the conversation. If you have to do a direct approach on the street, you can just say as your opener. ""Wow, you're really pretty"", that's it, she will respond with a thank you, maybe brush her hair quickly and you can ask her where she's from what she does etc. If she has an interesting accessory like earrings, a scarf an interesting color or just an amazing dress, you can point that out too, e.g. you can open with, ""Wow, you dress just looks amazing on you"". 

Imagine, how would you feel about maybe only a HB7 that just drops a ""wow, you are really pretty"" in a non-needy way in the conversation with an admiring look on her face. For the whole night you will remember and be attracted to her and when you drop out of another conversation you will look out for her, because you know you can always come back to her, she has given you the permission to come back with her statement. 

Same goes the other way around, if you tell her ""wow you're pretty early on in the conversation, you have her hooked. It's unbelievable, if it's a party, a social event or something else, the girl will search for you, even several times, because she knows every time she finds you again, you will make her feel good. That makes it so easy for you to initiate Kino, teasing her and all the other things. 

Hope some of you can take it up into their repository. :)

I cannot count how many men I've seen go for socially retarded to successful with women, leading happy social lives, getting married to a woman they truly deserve, or leading a dating life most people could only dream of.

After all of this time, I have realized that there is one simple factor that is more important than anything else when it comes to improving this area of your life.  Without it, all of the techniques, knowledge, and even practice is next to futile.

The first step, vitally important to your success with women, is to believe that you deserve success with women.  Truly believe that you, as socially awkward, challenged, or experienced though you may be DESERVE to have beautiful, intelligent, drama free women in your life.

Not that you'd like to have a pretty girlfriend, not that you might be able to improve your social skills to the point where you get the quality of women you want, and certainly not that you're just not ready yet or don't deserve the kind of women you want.

If you don't believe you're capable of graduating college, don't think you're smart enough, or just think you're not ready yet.... The overwhelming odds are that you will NOT graduate college.  Success with women, however you may define it, is the same way.

In my experience of coaching and meeting with everyone from socially awkward virgins to the world's greatest dating coaches, I have yet to see anyone who is dedicated and believes they deserve and are capable of success with women not achieve it.  Nor have I seen anyone get truly good with women who does not, and has not first believe they deserved such success.

It is up to you, and only you, to take this first step before expecting great or even mediocre results from your efforts.

Deal with yourself first.  Ask yourself if you truly believe you DESERVE great women in your life.  Ask yourself if you truly believe you are WILL have great women in your life.  If you do not answer affirmatively to both of these questions, your chances of success are less than signficant.

Ask yourself WHY you don't believe you deserve to be successful and happy in your dating life.  I've heard and seen all sort of limiting beliefs... Personal/Mental handicaps, weight issues, deformation, and defects that are so small nobody else notices them yet people are CONVINCED that is what is keeping them back.  However, I have also seen many individuals overcome GREAT obstacles to become AMAZINGLY successful with women.

I like that."" 

All the while, you have a slight friendly smile. But most importantly, maintain eye contact the entire time. Let go of her hand when she breaks eye contact. 

This works wonders because:

* Your interest in her is expressed immediately. This is not something a friend would do. 

* You are implying that you have met many ladies whose handshakes didn't impress you. Thus, implicit in this action is that you are accustomed to meeting people. 

* You establish that you are subtly judging her, which impels her to want to keep impressing you. 

* Confident eye contact is great. Touching her is great. Doing both at the same time is 20x better than either one individually. 

* You can accurately gauge her interest immediately; if she holds on tight and eye fucks you, you can't go wrong. If she reacts less than flattered, it's fine too because what you did is not creepy.

Playing it helps you if you struggle with AA, and no matter your level of skill with women this game can help you. It can also be a whole damn lot of fun.

The game is simple. You take turns being Cyrano. Cyrano picks a woman, a friend in your crew aka ""the lucky one"", and a line. ""The lucky one"" approaches the woman and says the line. It's that simple. If you're ""the lucky one"" and you say the line to her, you win. If you chicken out, you lose.

The lines we use are ridiculous. Anything from ""Have you ever seen a party blaster?"" to ""Listen, you don't know me, but right now we don't have much time and you have to trust me or it was all for nothing. Do you trust me? DO YOU TRUST ME?""  to ""I can see the spice on your face"" or maybe just a pterodactyl noise. The possibilities are literally endless.

The way to win the game, I repeat, is just to say the line. You do that, you win. Ideally you want to focus on saying it confidently and alpha, without any care about what the person thinks of you. If they hate you, well, you did in fact just say something weird to them so you shouldn't care. Stay and talk if you feel like it, and push your limits and flirt by all means, but just saying the line is a win.

This game is incredibly fun, it can get you in state, and you'll find that it leads to some actually great interactions more often than you'd expect. You'll often get a positive response just because you're different, and if you really own the line you can generate real attraction. Also, you might find it's somehow EASIER to not feel AA when you're playing this game because the lines are so ridiculous that if you get rejected you can't take it personally.

You can play this with any friend, whether or not they get into PU. I've played this game at bars with my buddies and their girlfriends, who have no clue I seddit. I've found that some people in relationships like being Cyrano because by giving you a line and a girl, they get the harmless little vicarious thrill from being part of the single people's single glory.

Two suggestions for when you're the Cyrano. 
1) Pick a hot girl for your friend, or at least one they'd like.  
2) Pick a line that will embarrass your friend, or at least be funny and unusual. You don't want to say blatantly offensive things, but almost as bad are boring things. That just isn't cool and isn't good wingmanship. An attitude of tough love for the other players makes the game better for everyone involved.

So next time you're at a bar or concert, play Cyrano. If you don't have a line, your first line is ""Do you have what it takes, or are you gonna be just another greenhorn chump like the rest of them?"" I just made that up now. They don't have to make any sense. 

So that's Cyrano. Play it next time you're out, no matter who you are. Noob or mPUA. Defeat AA, and strengthen your creativity muscles. And please tell me what you think if you do play, I'd love to hear a couple stories.

I had a really great set last night and I wanted to share it with you guys.

A friend of mine from NYC was visiting Hartford, CT for a job interview. He asked me to meet him for drinks. I offered to meet him there and then rendezvous to New Haven to hit on Friday night ladies. A mutual friend of ours joined for the journey.

We get to Hartford and head to a local beer bar. There are no women worth talking to, but we drink a couple obscure beers and watch Florida Gulf Coast upset Georgetown.

Around 9:45 we leave to make our way to New Haven. On the way my friend picks up a bag of [Mint Milano cookies.](http://www.pepperidgefarm.com/ProductDetail.aspx?catID=725&amp;prdID=112081) (These will become important in a bit!) We arrive and hit up one of the most pickup friendly venues I know (Cask Republic, for anyone who is curious). The place is full of cool people and the booze flows like water.

We post up at the bar and my friend buys a round of drinks. He is looking good in a suit and tie. There is an intimidating 5-set of absolutely beautiful girls at a table. He says ""I'm gonna do a shot and the go in."" And so he does. He seems to hook somewhat, but he definitely needs backup. I am trying to get our mutual friend out of his shell so I send him in with some really easy line to use. 

I sit back at the bar, while they work, and watch some more NCAA basketball.

**Cookies &amp; AMOGs**

As I am sitting there, a cute little blonde walks up looking to order drinks. She appears to be on a double date with her girlfriend and two random dudes (one black, one white - both pretty big). I see an opportunity for a simple situational opener. I take the bag of Mint Milanos that had been sitting on the bar and say, ""Hey, did you know these come in mint too? My mind is absolutely blown."" The girl smiles and starts talking when the two guys in the back start AMOGing from peanut gallery. **""Come here little girl, I have candy in my van outside,"" they say mockingly.** 

Now, most guys would be intimidated by such blatant attempts at AMOGing and either shirk away or strike back but I'm not most guys.

I smile and completely ignore their comment and invite them into the conversation. ""Seriously, did you know these come in mint? BTW want one? They're delicious.""

The guys look astonished at how smoothly I handled their AMOG attempt. One of them actually takes a cookie. **I literally have them eating out of my hand!** Fuck yeah.

I can see the attraction start to spike from the little blonde. She has that ""Wow, this guy is cool"" look on her face. I situate myself between her and her group while she orders. I take this chance to flirt with her a bit. We make some small chitchat and it turns out we have a lot in common. I can see a lot of potential with her. 

I notice she's not getting service from the bartender, so I say to her, ""Wanna race? Let's see who can get served first."" I then put my hand out and a bartender who I didn't even know walks over and says hi and shakes my hand. I don't even know the guy, but I think he was watching my pickup attempt and wanted to add a little social proof into the mix. Thanks random bartender!

He then takes both mine and her order. She says ""Put his drink on my tab."" **Fuck yeah! Free drink. I'm so in.** 

I thank her for the drink and she shrugs it off, ""You got the bartender's attention for me."" I brush my hand on her hip and she hands the drinks to her two dates and friend and then goes to the back to sit down on her shitty double date. I can tell she wishes she was in my reality and not hers at that moment.

I sit back, sip my beer, open another set that doesn't go anywhere. Then something really cool happens. A couple nervous looking guys walk up and say hi to me. One of them compliments me on my hairstyle and says he is growing his hair out. He seems nervous and looking to make conversation with someone. He very quickly offers to buy me a black &amp; tan. I graciously accept and try to give him lots of enthusiastic conversation. I'm not 100% certain, but I think they were out trying to get more social and work on their AA. I have been in his shoes before, so I wanted to give him a very positive interaction. It felt pretty special, for whatever reason.

Anyway, two free drinks in and I'm flying high, in state like a motherfucker. I decide it's time to get the number of my little blonde friend. I walk back towards their table, which is close to the bathroom. She is sitting at a table on her double date. I give a very subtle wave and smile. She makes eye contact. I motion towards the bathroom and walk over by it.

No less than 20 seconds later, she shows up. I grab her and immediately make out with her. It was quick but passionate. I don't want her date to walk over and catch her making out with a random guy. **Guys, it's so important to be socially aware. I want to fly under the radar. Blowing up her spot in front of her double date will not accomplish anything. Instead it can be our little secret affair.**

I quickly get her number and excuse her. My job here is done.

I'm not a bad looking guy, but I was overweight my whole life and even after losing most of the weight I still struggle with depression.
This manifests itself most around girls. I hadn't dated or slept with a girl over a HB5 until 6 months ago and she was a 7 at best. I just run into the problems I'm sure many of you are familiar with: problems talking, keeping composure, preventing oneitis etc. Worse, the more I struggled the more it fueled my depression. Not a pretty cycle.

Then I found you guys and started reading. What follows is a brief description of my first, and ongoing, relationship after reading up and mentally changing my game.

I met this girl on OKC, honestly I felt conflicted, on the one hand we had a lot in common, on the other while she had a great body, she had some facial problems(not ugly, just bad skin). But feeling motivated and determined to practice if nothing else, I forged ahead.

After some brief back and forth, mostly about zombies. I got her number and immediately texted her. After a few messages I cut her off and didn't text her till the next day. When I did text her again I simply told her that I was going out that night and she should come. She quickly agreed. Honestly I was amazed at how well what I had read was working, normally I stuggle to transition to meeting in real life and instead this had taken like 5 minutes of work.

At the bar I let her relax a bit and have a couple of drinks before initiating kino. I noticed she had a large elaborate ring on, and used that as an excuse to grab her hand and hold it for several minutes, asking questions about it and transitioning into related activities. From there I escalated quickly, stopping just short of a k-close, though teasing her, asking if I was going to get a kiss that night. Then I suggested we change venues and go bowling. As we walked out, I could tell she was dying for a kiss, so I purposefully ignored her and walked to my car.

Once we got to the bowling alley, I grabbed her outside the door and k-closed there. She melted and grabbed me when I tried to pull away. I then discovered something amazing...bowling is practically the perfect activity after a k-close. We were in close proximity, often brushing against each other and I could initiate and break off kisses as often or as sparingly as I liked. By the second game I was even specifically rewarding her for impressing me, giving long kisses for strikes or spares, and short ones or withholding all together for anything else. By the 4th game she was coming up to me expectantly after she bowled well.

Fast forward through that night to a couple of days later. Again I text her briefly and say I want to see a movie. She suggests Warm Bodies and I give a time and place. We snuggle through the movie and I slowly escalate kino the whole time. By the end my hands are in her pants and she's clinging to my arm. I suggest we get drinks and go back to my place. She quickly agrees and off we go.

Suffice to say, i f-closed that night and we made plans for a few days later. Now this is the part where I was honestly thankful for you guys and figured you'd be proud of me. We miscommunicated the day we would be getting together and I stood her up. She was understandably mad, but I didn't dwell on it and pushed the conversation past that and rescheduled. The next day I get a text from her saying ""I'm sorry, I just can't get over how upset I am about what happened the other day, I don't want to see you anymore"".

Now in the past this is where I would panic, start apologizing profusely and sink myself. But after reading some of the guides, I just couldn't shake the feeling that this was a massive shit test. So I simply responded with ""Ok, when you change your mind, you have my number"" and sure enough two days later I get a response saying how sorry she was and that she was a moron and wanted me to forgive her. I told her I'd give her another shot and if she impressed me I'd take her back. We went to dinner, SHE actually payed, then back to my place. She just left and I can honestly say that I just had one of the best nights of my life. and I owe it all to you Seddit.

So Thank You. You've honestly made a difference in my life.

I have Friend with Benefits relationship with a HB7, and my text game with her can be spot-y. I can say something 'uncool' or not smooth and she might be flaky with a next meet up or she might give me a shit test. Like bogus stuff just because I didn't text something cool or witty back. 

How I learned the Technique:

I took an improv class last week and rule #1 is ""yes, and.."".  This rule is to always be mindful of your improv partner. For example if someone says ""No, let's not."" during a scene--the scene doesn't go anywhere. 

Since it was a beginner class, many people made a mistake by disagreeing during a scene (i.e saying ""No""). Our teacher would call it out and let us do the scene over, but this time agreeing, and it made a world of difference. Someone would disagree with me while we were acting, and then we would re-do the scene with the person agreeing--I felt so much better with the person agreeing with me. 

(I think there is psychological side to this as well) 

Technique:

So back to this HB7. This past week I have been using the ""Yes, and."" in text conversation and it has been going great. 

* I'll get a response within minutes of sending a text. 

* She is more flirtatious with me. 

* I believe I am more entertaining (more of a confidence booster--just fucking say ""yes, and I want to see you this weekend)

And it's really just simple. 





HB7: I have a canoe trip Saturday from 8 to 6, but no plans after. 

Masterofalltradesjon: Yes after canoeing you'll be nice and relaxed for me.

HB7:Or really exhausted and need a massage. 

Moatjon: Yes and we could get into the Jacuzzi. 

HB7: True.

HB7: R u free now?

1358600838.0,386,self.seduction,16vh4b,"[FR] I just got kicked out of a bar for being a ""pick-up artist"".",663,277,320,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16vh4b/fr_i_just_got_kicked_out_of_a_bar_for_being_a/,"So, I thought I would share my evening with you all - it was an extremely strange one.

Essentially, I have been going to a particular club near where I live quite regularly and inevitably I have become great friends with the bouncers and bar staff (and the general manager).

Tonight, I walk in and start my usual 2-3 warm-up sets (short-sets) and vibe off a few girls - establishing solid social proof for myself. After a while, I spot two gorgeous blonde girls having a chat and decide to open. Walk by then (over the shoulder) indirectly open. Everything goes extremely well and I establish some attraction and they obviously want me there. Left one starts kino with me and takes off my glasses. All good so far.

**THEN SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLE HAPPENS...** The duty/floor manager comes up behind me while I'm in this two-set and grabs my neck and **DRAGS** me out. At this point I'm like what the fuck. He puts his arm around me and says ""I know what you're doing. I've seen you in here countless times talking to my girls and I don't like it. So if I see it happen again, you won't be welcome anymore.""

**ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME???** He then calls me out on using some routines/strategies (which I only use initially in set) and names certain things I have said to chicks over the past few months. He then says something that is absolutely **fucking illogical**...""Girls should be coming up and talking to you, not the other way around. You shouldn't be talking to girls in here because we are here to make money."" I.e. stop talking to girls so they buy drinks!!! This shit is bonkers. I am a fucking loyal customer of this bar.

Finally, he escorts me out and says he doesn't want a ""pick-up artist"" in his club (actually what he said). Obviously, I am not welcome back to this place. My thoughts at this point are fizzing anger and frustration, however I am not reactive and remain civil and personable. I will not drop my value for this jealous loser who obviously has been watching me pick-up countless beautiful women and is too much of a **fucking lethargic pussy** to get girls himself.

The scary thing is that I am genuinely not a loser who will come into the club and be the creepy, seedy guy who weirds out the girls in the bar. I have been studying and practicing seduction for a LONG time and I achieve excellent results. Girls want to be approached by interesting, attractive, assertive men. Not creeps. That's why we're all here. And I successfully reach the ""hook point"" with the large majority of my sets, while also acknowledging that when there is no interest, I should eject the set and ""get back to my friends"".

Truthfully, I am fucking pissed because I can't comprehend how another guy could be such a massive cockblocker. Also, this guy is overlooking the fact that bars/clubs are fucking there for customers to come in and socialize and meet new, interesting people. This douchebag is effectively denying me that opportunity.

Not entirely sure what to do this point - this is the club I have had the most success in and I don't want to be banned from there just because I am meeting girls (crazy). It also has the best calibre of girls in my terribly depressing city. Any advice or thoughts on this situation would be appreciated.


**EDIT:** Thanks for your input guys. There seems to be two arguments (both equally valid) - 1) Someone has complained about me talking to girls in the bar, or one particular girl has complained, thus giving the manager fuel to kick me out; and 2) The manager is a big jealous AFC and is white-knighting hard.

Personally, I would say it's a combination of both, which is not good. **SO**, what I'm going to do is take a break from this location (it's the best bar to meet girls in my city - it's huge) for a couple weeks then go back. And if he still gives me shit then, I might have a word to the GM (only as a last resort). When I go back I will bring girls with me to the club (even pivots) in order to relieve his anxiety about how I'm stealing all his precious girls.

Good quote below from atheistjubu which summarizes this in a nutshell: ""Kicking a guy out of a bar for trying to pick up chicks is like kicking a guy off a golf course for hitting balls into holes.""

So...

Last week, I was in Vegas for a few days of debauchery and went to a strip club with a couple of buddies (Treasures, if anybody is wondering).  Now this place probably had over 100 strippers while there was probably only 50 guys there (kind of the ratio most girls see at a bar, a 2:1 ratio of guys to girls).  During the 2 or 3 hours I was there, I was probably approached by over 30 girls (maybe around a girl every 10 minutes).  Finally, the shoe was on the other foot, women approaching me!!!  But the sad thing is, it started to get annoying, super annoying.  Why?  Because I was approached in exactly the same way by almost every single girl.

Now bear with me.  I knew all of these girls had an agenda- to get my money (don't we have an agenda when we approach girls?).  And I did end up getting a few lapdances, so how did I decide on which girls to give my precious $$$ to?  I may be in the minority here, but it wasn't based on looks or physique (although it did factor into the equation a little, but it wasn't a major deciding factor).  I realized it came down to who ""seduced"" me the best.  So who failed? 

1.  If she was low energy.  I was having way too much fun with my buds to be dragged down by some boring girl.   -Next

2.  If I smelled an agenda on the girl, as in she was just interested in my money, she was automatically dismissed (I felt no connection to her, I was just a paycheck).  NEXT

3.  If she opened me like every other girl there did, (hey, where are you from?  hey, what are you guys celebrating tonight? hey, how long are you in town for?)  BORING!  NEXT

4.  If she commented on my shirt (I was wearing a tuxedo t-shirt because I'm fancy, but I like to party).  Every girl commented on my shirt.  They each said the same thing.  Clones of each other.  BORING.

So the girls that I got dances from?  They didn't approach me like all of the other girls.  They were actually pretty interesting/funny.  They were engaging in conversation (but not too much, not boring).  They were good with physical contact (it was subtle, I almost didn't notice them touching me.  I felt good, but didn't really know why until I realized they were slightly touching my arm or leg.  SEE: kino).  They kept a sexual vibe, but it wasn't overbearing.   It seemed like they were actually connecting with me (I''m in my early 30's, I'm not naive enough to think strippers actually want me, but they charmed me none the less).  

So, although I do expect to get a lot of funny responses to this post, it was actually an enlightening experience.  It definitely helped me better understand how attraction works and why we make the decisions that we do.  I definitely will apply what I learned and use it to modify/ learn from my own approaches.  

Lessons learned:

1.  Differentiate myself from all the other guys in the bar.  Accentuate what make me different/unique.

2.  Don't underestimate the power of kino.

3.  Maintain a sexual vibe, but make sure it is subtle.  Don't be a walking billboard advertising my agenda.

4.  Focus on building rapport and comfort.

5.  Escalate and close when her buying temperature is high.


That all being said, I also got a dance from a girl that offered to stroke my cock in the corner.

1349539639.0,383,self.seduction,111nf6,3 Steps to Quickly Getting Over Your Ex,490,107,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/111nf6/3_steps_to_quickly_getting_over_your_ex/,"It’s hard to get over your ex and sometimes it takes longer than you’d like. It’s a painful process that many men have to go through. I’ve been there myself and I can say it’s not pretty. I would never wish that pain upon ANYONE. That’s why I have created three easy steps to get over your ex. These are steps that my students and I have taken previously and have worked extremely well.

**1) End all contact**
This is one of the most controversial steps, but such an important one. Once it’s over, it’s over. Any lingering or lasting conversation does nothing but prolong your pain. You must let her know that both of you cannot have any communication for awhile. Yes, you must let her know, so she gives you that space. If she continues to contact you, then it will bait you into keeping up contact, which can lure you back in. 

The reason you need to drop contact is because you want to start putting those memories as far into the past as you can. Out of sight, out of mind. The fact of the matter is, time truly does heal all wounds. If you want to get over your ex, it’s going to take time and time won’t start until you end all contact with her.

• No phone calls

• No texting

• De-friend her on Facebook

• Try and disband from her social group

• Avoid any physical contact at all costs

I can’t stress enough how important this step is in getting over your ex. The sooner you start, the sooner you will move on.

**2) Start talking to other girls**
A lot of men wait to date other women after a break-up. I understand that starting to see other women might be tough and remind you of your ex. But my advice here isn’t to necessarily start dating again. If you are ready to date, then I urge you to start immediately! If not, then at least start talking to other girls. Even some light flirting or nice conversation can really help you get over your ex. As much as you may hate the female species right after a break-up, you have to be reminded that they are all not like your ex. In fact, a lot of men find solace in talking to other women that are the exact opposite of their ex, because it gives them a taste of something new. Start talking to other girls and give your new singlehood the old college try.

**3) Don’t let yourself be alone**
If you want to get over your ex, be in the presence of your friends or others as much as possible. The second you are alone, not only will you start thinking about her, but you will feel lonelier than ever. That’s what happens when you go through a break-up. Loneliness creeps in harder during this time than almost any other. The way to combat that is to spend time with your friends and family. Forget that you ever dated your ex (at least for these few months that you’re trying to get over her). Here are some other ideas:

• Go out to the bars and clubs

• Volunteer

• Join some meet-up groups

• Run errands even if you don’t need to

• Call some friends you haven’t talked to in awhile

It’s not easy to get over your ex, but if you take these small steps, then you will surely be on your way faster than you think. Any other suggestions you guys think?

**1. WHAT IS A ""NICE GUY""?**

&gt; **bash.org:**

&gt; A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.

This reasoning is the epitome of ""Nice Guy"" thinking.

Basically a ""Nice Guy"" is someone who wonders why if they are so nice and good to women, why they won't reciprocate (sleep with them)? The reason is: because they don't have to, and no force in the world can change that. Let's now get into the nitty-gritty of what's wrong with being a ""Nice Guy"" (hereafter referred to as an NG).

Some quotes that are helpful:

&gt; **Vulvarine posted:**

&gt; I think it's really important to distinguish between niceness and kindness. *Kindness is a real, positive, desirable trait in a romantic partner. Niceness is just the ability to be inoffensive.* Most women who don't like ""nice guys"" are perfectly affable toward kind men as a dateable group.

    
&gt; **Ionic posted:**

&gt; One of the keys to understanding the Nice Guy vs. the clueless innocent is that the Nice Guy's definition of himself as such is usually the result of repeated romantic failure and a resulting, crippling bitterness. The clueless innocents eventually bumble their way out of that stage. That's the difference. 

&gt; I don't want to make this into more than it is, but I think many men fail to grasp exactly how uncomfortable and, potentially, vulnerable a woman can feel in the face of persistent attention, flattery, and the like. 

&gt; It flies in the face of years and years of social conditioning to tell an outwardly ""nice"" man - one who has in no way technically threatened, harassed, or intimidated you - to ""get the fuck away, I'm not interested."" It's one thing to tell off the drunk who's trying to cop a feel on the subway. But rejecting the friend who just won't stop hanging around looking for more? It's not a simple situation.

&gt; So, many women just don't do it. Especially confident and assertive women can do it easily, but even a woman without self-esteem problems could understandably find it difficult to be ruthlessly direct in that situation. All too often, we opt for subtlety instead.

&gt; And that's where the real problem with Nice Guys comes in. A regular guy would get the hint, see it as a matter of compatibility and not take it personally, then move on to someone more likely to return his interest. A Nice Guy, on the other hand, will stick around and attempt to wear you down.  Often Nice Guys will pursue ""'hard luck' cases"" - women who are perhaps not the best-prepared to stand up for themselves. 

&gt; And in the end, if the Nice Guy doesn't get what he wants? He invents a scenario that makes his wasted effort a noble quest to overcome, what he tells himself is, his target's shitty taste in men. Because admitting that he wasted his time pushing for something that was clearly never going to happen is just plain cognitively uncomfortable. 

&gt; To sum up, the ""perfect storm"" that goes into creating a self-described Nice Guy is a mix of a sense of entitlement, a mark who is too kind and/or passive to outright reject the NG, and the NG's persistence in the face of what many other individuals would recognize as subtle signals of mark's disinclination to mate. 

* **1.1 Manipulation**

NG behaviour is manipulative. NGs basically do everything they can to 'make' someone fall for them in an underhanded way. It makes every ""nice"" act revolve around the ulterior goal of getting with 'that' girl. They do it so hard that it becomes a second nature and they're not even conscious of it.

* **1.2 Unrealistic objectification**

NG behaviour ultimately reduces women to objects. While they would vehemently deny it, NGs project all their romantic fantasies on one (or sometimes multiple, or successive) girls, which blinds them to the fact that these women are independent people. 

* **1.3 Dishonesty**

NGs are not nice for the sake of being nice. They're nice because they think they'll get something in return. Granted that many people behave that way, but the Nice Guy often has a particularly bad case of this, which sometimes even veers straight into a type of co-dependency or creates a massive entitlement complex.

* **1.4 It doesn't work**

Most women and many men can sense that you're a ""Nice Guy"", and think it's creepy. Also, it plain just doesn't work. Even if you insist on having some sort of mathematical formula for ""women like X, Y and Z so if I do that, I'll get laid"", the Nice Guy Technique has appalling success rates.

* **1.5 ""Ugh, women always end up dating douches""**

Nobody likes assholes, and any women who says she prefers ""bad boys"" past age 25 is probably sort of broken herself. *However, most women who end up with guys that have glaring flaws don't date them because of their flaws. They end up dating them/sleeping with them because they are self-confident, have interesting stuff to say, are attractive or act like actual people instead of a scripted doormat.* Also, maybe her SO is acting hostile towards you because he can sense your true motives. 

* **1.6 Passiveness**

One particular reason why the ""friendship"" between an NG and their 'one true love' or whatever is shallow and questionable is that NGs typically don't go in against their object's opinions (unless their position is threatened somehow), even if these are wrong or questionable. It's pretty passive at best and sycophantic at worst.

* **1.7 ""I am nice""**

NGs often describe themselves as being ""nice"", and oddly enough, so do many people around them. Well, if the first thing that comes up in your mind, or in others' if you need to be described, is ""nice"", then you have a problem because it means you're not particularly seen as having personality.


**2. TYPICAL NICE GUY EXCUSES**

* **2.1 ""But I am genuinely a friend.""**

If you are, then why are you moping how girls only ""want you as a friend""? Also, a variant of this excuse is NGs who go out of their way to not do anything or act on their feelings as long as their object of desire is in a relationship, but prefer pining in the shadows, bottling up massive frustrations.

* **2.2 ""But in that movie/novel...""**

Popular culture tends to feed the idea that the NG thing is somehow cute, worth empathising with or even truly romantic. Like so many clichés about love and relationships in pop culture, it couldn't be further from the truth. Pop culture loves exploiting NGs because it tugs on a few heart strings and is good for drama. It doesn't make this sort of behaviour mentally healthy or advisable, and if you're going to take dating advice from pop culture, well, then I don't know what to say.

* **2.3 ""If she doesn't like it, why doesn't she say anything about it?""**

Nice guys make an advance that cannot be rejected in a socially acceptable way. If a guy says, ""Hey, how about a date?"", then it's perfectly socially acceptable to say, ""Nah, I'm not interested."" But instead he might say, ""Oh, you're moving? I'd love to help. When? Hmm, I'm working that day, but I can call out sick. It's really no problem! I don't own a truck, but I could rent one of those ones from the Home Depot."" Is this guy really helpful just generally, or is there some subtext there of him trying to impress you? Should you say, ""That would be really helpful, but since I am not attracted to you, I am honor-bound not to accept your offer of assistance""? Of course not. So you don't say it, and then there's this weird THING sort of hanging in the air in your dealings with that person in the future. You're like 85% sure that he's into you, but every time he has an opportunity to actually say it, he passes it up. Eventually, you relax a little, and then one day one of your dumber girlfriends lets on in front of this guy that you have car trouble. You try to hiss at her or step on her foot or something, but you're too slow or she's too clueless, and his eyes brighten. ""Can I look at it? I'd be happy to help!"" Ugh.

* **2.4 ""Welp, guess I should become an asshole then!""**

Apart from being a non-argument/false dichotomy, in fact, NGs are already assholes, but with a mask of niceness. You can certainly be a nice person without the deeper layers of manipulation, self-pity and self-entitlement.

**3. HOW TO SNAP OUT OF BEING A ""NICE GUY""**

* **3.1** Realise that the world doesn't owe you anything, and by extension, women don't owe you anything merely because you're ""nice"" for all the wrong reasons.

* **3.2** Stop being a passive-aggressive doormat and be more candid about your desires. This will mean having to take rejection, too.

* **3.3** Don't pine. Realise that there are many, many potentially compatible partners that you could have while wasting time on projecting your romantic fantasies onto someone who will never reciprocate.

* **3.4** Realise that there is no ""manual"" to women, no guaranteed rules, etc. If you're autistic or have a bad case of the 'sperg, seek therapy.

1289881404.0,379,self.seduction,e6rtv,Ten Steps to strong inner game. (by me),465,86,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e6rtv/ten_steps_to_strong_inner_game_by_me/,"The following ten lessons/tips are all ones I've learned myself during my years of learning seduction. I've gone from pining for a year for an ex girlfriend to having exponentially more confidence and inner strength.  

**1)** Catch yourself every time you make a negative comment or judgement about someone else. Either shut the fuck up about it or rephrase yourself. People are more distrustful of gossips and being negative about others reinforces a pessimistic negative attitude inside yourself. Try and find positive things about other people and it becomes a pattern in your life. If you're thinking about more positive things it makes you into a happier more positive person. Girls want a guy who's fun and happy in himself; they don't want a negative dude who's always bitching or complaining about others. 


**2)** Take your time to realize that things are not as bad as you think they are. I often see dudes on the train stressing out or cussing because the train is late, or someone's walking slowly in front of them. Just relax. There's no reason to get stressed over shit that you can't do anything about. Remember this quote: ""Control the things you can control, let everything else take a flying fuck"". Say it out loud. SAY IT OUT LOUD NOW. 


**3)** Actually fucking listen to stuff other people say and try to understand why they're saying it. If you want to build strong relationships with your lovers and friends and become a real people person, you need to really listen to what they say. When someone hangs out with you, they are giving some of their most precious commodity to you, TIME. If someone chooses to be with you, then you better fucking value their choice and listen to what they have to say. People say things for a reason, and it's your duty to listen to them and try to relate it back to them. If you do this you'll find you really start to understand other people and your conversations will be deeper and more meaningful.


**4)** Stop arguing. Put simply, no one likes an arguer, don't be one of those people who keeps arguing and arguing and never gives up a point, much to  the annoyance of everyone else. I used to do this because I had an argumentative dad and it turned me into a stubborn mother-fucker. I had a revelation when I was 22 and arguing with my girlfriend over doing the fucking dishes. ""Wow, this is completely ridiculous, what a waste of time"". If you ""win"" an argument, you've won nothing; it's a contradiction. Generally what happened is you annoyed someone else and won no friends. Learn to realize when a debate will never end and just LET IT GO. I think actually being able to say: ""actually this is fucking stupid, let's stop arguing"" is a big DHV. 


**5)** Take a few moments each day to remember good shit from your past. Think about the people from your past that you have respect for. Now remember any good things that they said about you or compliments that they gave you. This may be an ex-girlfriend, a friend whatever, even a hot girl from a club. Think back to whatever they said about you and imagine them standing in front of you giving you that compliment. Then imagine being that person and looking back at yourself as they compliment you. Try to see yourself from their eyes. Understand that they really meant what they said and that you can take massive positivity from whatever they said. 


**6)** ""Everything I do, I rush through so I can do something else"". This is a quote from a favorite poem of mine, it illustrates the way most people live their lives. The days become a stressful blur, nothing ever seems to get finished, and you dwell on the future and cannot enjoy the present fully. Take a moment to take a step back and fucking breathe. Don't dwell too much on the future, it will come when it comes but don't let it stress you right now. (Side note: learn to meditate and start doing yoga. These will both help with this step)


**7)** Finish what you start. Get into the habit of finishing each task you start, get into the habit of doing this and it becomes a real source of happiness and confidence in your life. Start by ensuring you finish all your small tasks, such as reading an article or hitting on 5 girls (or whatever target) in a night. Don't set your goals too wildly


**8)** Learn shit. Finish that book on psychology or philosophy; the act of learning new things and keeping the brain working seems to have a slowing effect on time. Also, when you're learning new things it makes you a more interesting person to other people. I often go into deep conversations about Psychology with women and they love it! I learned all that stuff just from all the Psych books I read from learning about seduction, female psychology etc. I also study poetry and literature in my spare time, guess what? Girls love this stuff too. Seduction/PUA isn't just about games and tricks and routines, it's also about making yourself into a genuinely interesting and well-rounded individual. Being smart and knowledgable about the world is sexy and powerful.


**9)** Make peace with your past. Come to realize that you cannot change the past. Whatever bad stuff happened to you, however much you got hurt by that girl or those bullies or your asshole dad. Let it go. No good comes from revisiting it again and again. In fact, the more you think about it, the more you dwell on it. Look back at point 2. This comes under the category of ""things you can't control"". If you can't do something about it, and you certainly cannot change your past, then there's no fucking use in worrying about it or dwelling on it. I've found that so many people dwell on bad moments in their past even when they know that these memories make them sad. It becomes a habit and eventually becomes such a part of your character that you're almost afraid to let it go. It's like a safety blanket. It's exactly the same reason why some people who have been overweight for many years find it so hard to lose the weight; it has become part of their identity and losing the weight is almost like killing part of their personality. The thing about this point is that it's suprisingly easy; your mind is under your control. You decide what you think about. If you spend your time thinking about how awesome your ex was and how sad you are; stop fucking thinking about it. Imagine yourself surrounded by smoking hot 9s and being the life of the party. 


**10)** Keep in touch. Stay in touch with your friends. When things aren't going so well, good friends will be there for you. No matter how bullet-proof you think you are, friends are always an asset. So shout out to them often, even if it's just a text message or short email. Having lots of friends is a massive confidence booster and also a good friendship network is a gold-mine for meeting new girls. Also the advantage of meeting girls this way is you don't even need an opener and there's zero approach anxiety.

TLDR: Be a man and read it.

1370628057.0,378,self.seduction,1fvjni,Overcoming a sticking point: Making the conversation a SEXUAL conversation! Some pointers on how to do it.,488,110,129,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fvjni/overcoming_a_sticking_point_making_the/,"I think I've overcome a sticking point recently: getting the conversation to go in a sexual direction. On the last few dates I've gone on, I've managed to steer the conversation that way in a very comfortable manner and it's lead to MUCH easier escalation.

I think part of what was holding me back before was my own mentality of being judged for being some kind of sexual deviant. That, and not knowing what I wanted sexually out of another partner. It took me a bit to realize that not only is it okay to be a person that desires a lot of good sex, but that I don't want to be with a partner that also doesn't love sex as much as I do.

So how does that transfer into dating?

I try to make a point of making the girl realize that I'm a non-judgemental individual. Part of this includes making myself vulnerable. If I'm asked something like ""are you a player?"" I'll almost definitely own up to it. One of my most recent makeouts was right after telling a girl that I'm in ""total manwhore mode in life"". Because I was honest with myself in my intent, and honest with her, she was okay to be honest with me. We then had a long conversation about how ridiculous it is for someone to judge someone for liking to hook up with other people, and she opened up to me about her being a really horny person in general, which made it really easy to transition into a kiss.

As awkward as you feel about a sexual conversation is how awkward it will be. This also means that if you're totally easygoing talking about sex, and it's not a big deal to talk about it, she'll feel that way as well. So if any innuendo pops up, jump on that shit. If you see something provocative while you're talking to her, bring it up and discuss! But don't feel weird that you're discussing, because this is NORMAL FOR YOU. I think this falls into the RSD concept of ""Law Of State Transference"". 

On another date I was on earlier this week with someone else, we found ourselves in a book store, where I got her to come look at the sexuality section. We then pulled out random books and talked/joked about the different positions that were in the diagrams. She initially was a bit weird about it, but because I held a casual frame, she became very relaxed about it and then a long sexual discussion began where she opened up about a lot of things like wanting threeesomes, sex on M, etc. Any time she'd say something that lined up with my sexual desires, I'd give her a high five or something similar to give it a casual demeanour. Like ""Yes! I LOVE girls that like aggressive sex! Awesome! (high five)""

So the main points here:

- Be non-judgemental (doesn't mean you can't tease)

- Make yourself vulnerable

- BE CASUAL ABOUT IT

- don't shy away from a chance to bring it up

- Don't let yourself become awkward, there's no reason to

- create opportunity for sexual remarks, which lead to longer conversations

7. *You can’t tell me how to live my life!* - Joking that they're being bossy and you won't stand for that. They'll most likely apologize or something alike.

But after I recently got dumped (the relationship lasted almost five years), I realized one thing: No matter how strong you are, how much you can lift above your head - it means nothing when the ground disappears below you.

I was lost, but I decided to use the old ""fake it 'til you make it"". And this week, I made it.

I went out pretty much exactly 3 weeks after the break-up, and I was approached almost instantly by a really cute girl I'd been flirting with some time back, which ended with more than a phone number, and we're gonna meet up again tomorrow. I also have a movie date on Monday with another girl I met earlier, we recently got into contact again. And then there's a third girl I recently met that I'm gonna see some time next week.

It would have been easy to ignore the attention I was getting, or even stop getting the attention at all, just because of how head over heels I was. But I didn't. And in the (almost) ten years since I discovered the community, maybe other than when I got together with my now-ex, I've never been more glad I stuck with it.

I've read so much about people coming out of long term relationships and having no clue what to do. That's not me, and it won't be you if you stick with the program.

There is a girl I have been seeing as friends once every couple weeks for the last couple months.  I was really interested in her, and I got the impression that she was interested in me too.  Anyway, she is leaving to go to Europe 1.5 years next month.  I knew this since the day I met her.  So, we never allowed ourselves to get close to each other.

Anyway, tonight we were hanging out for our last time.  I figured, fuck it, I might as well try to kiss this girl just to see what I can get away before she leaves to see how she really felt about me this whole time...   When the end of the night arrived we were saying a pretty awkward goodbye, talking about sappy things we did in the past as friends, etc.  She said how about a hug, so we got close, and then I just straight up told her I want to kiss you.  I really thought she was giving me the correct IOI s. Anyway,   She covered her mouth awkwardly and said i'm too shy, kind of as a polite way of showing me she was not interested.  Anyway, I take the hint, don't push it, and wish her well on her travels, etc.  

The whole drive home I felt super embarrassed. I guess I possibly just killed our friendship.  I kept thinking about how stupid I must have looked trying to pull that on her at the end of the night.

But, then I had another thought.  What if I never tried to kiss this girl.....What if we just had another awkward goodbye, and then she left the country.  I would be forever wondering about her true feelings for me.  That would suck a lot more than the embarrassment of getting rejected tonight.

So, yea, being rejected sucks, and I am still feeling it now.  But, I know in the long run, I will feel better about taking the chance I did, even if she never views me the same way.  Time to man up and do some approaches.  Good luck to all.

**State**

State is pick-up chic these days. I see a lot of guys, myself included, focus on getting into “state” without regard to the other aspects of social interactions. Granted, if the choice between state or no state, choose state. This is part of the distancing from Mystery Method that a lot of places push, and I typically see it come with a lack of entitlement. When I first started going out, I believed that all I needed to bang the girl in front of me was an opener, a hook, and a number close. Now I see people conditioned with this mindset of “no, if I want to close, I need to warm up with 5 sets, get blown out 3 times, and then I don’t give a fuck and can fuck a 10.” Putting this half an hour long warm up in front of you before you can achieve results is a self-defeating mindset that harms you, and sometimes you just seem like kind of a dick if you’re doing it just to get blown out instead of seeing if that person is right for you.

Don't ignore the whole concept of state, but don’t think you can have success only if you’re in “state.” 

**How I envision ""the game""**

I see it as a team sport, your team vs. hers. Think of American football, your characteristics are your players: your grooming, looks, dress, confidence, body language, opener, how well you hooked her, text game, social proof, etc. Every one is a player with its own rating, level of quality on your team. Say you're a pass-heavy run and gun offense, you're instantly charming, you score a lot. Or maybe you're a run/defense based team, you take a while, but you run down the clock and end up winning the game more often, and can win championships. Whatever it is, it's fine, but there are 2 things worth taking away from this:(**1**) No single player can win the game, but any single one can lose it. (**2**) You’re playing against another team with their own players.

* (1)  Michael Vick, Dan Marino and a lot of flashy offenses score a lot, but it's a well balanced team that wins championships. Play to your strengths, don't think you can ride solely on them to win a championship. Be balanced.

* (2) She's a different team with different players. You play the Ravens differently than you play the 49ers. Remember, any given Sunday. 

**Self Correction**

Actively make yourself happy, not just for the time you’re in pick up mode, but all the time. I find in guys a lot, there’s some sort of desire to be “Righteously Angry.” Guys look for reasons to be mad, fume about guys cutting them off in traffic, being mad on the metro, and actively look for reasons to be mad/angry. This is bad, and a chance to self correct your state. Don't be that guy on an airplane looking for someone to bitch about a crying baby. 

**Relationships**

I am in multiple relationships, a few over 6 months old. Something that took me over a year of work to get to. Completely open, completely express. There have been some that have crashed over that time as well, but women of all different types have been super willing to engage me in an open relationship. 

Don't think ""oh, open sexual relationship, that means I can tell her about every other girl I bang!"" **#Nopers.** The key here is to be as explicit as you have to be, so she knows what the deal is. You’re busy, not on a date. You’re out with friends etc. I tell them that I am not exclusive with them, but I don’t tell them I’m “fucking” other girls, that’s classless, and a tad bit mean. However, these girls need to know that you have other women waiting and willing. Let other pictures with women show up on your facebook, when girls ask you where you were “oh , I had a thing ;)” with a twinkle in your eye. 

**Long term Momentum**
  
Go out often, and in a row. I did it 5 nights in a row for the first time in probably a year. I can't stress this enough. The first night, was one of my worst dates ever. I choded my way through a k-close denial, twice on the same date, where she spent 2 hours dry-rubbing her genitals against mine. The 3rd night, pulled 5 numbers and had 2 f-closes. The 4th night? One of the hottest girls I have ever talked to approached me, opened me, then begged for my number. I was tuned into the right frequency. Stick with it. 
 
**Moving into a natural state**

Be more natural. Try to avoid lines, you want build those creative pathways in your brain. This is the type of game that will make pick up life bleed over into your regular life. Some of the best ladies-men I know have never seen or heard of game, they are confident, wonderfully nice, challenging, and sexual, and they have just talked to a lot of people in their life. Like water, let the conversation flow, but direct it.

**Plowing with positivity**

I work with an AMOG. Not your average one, an amazing natural I've seen pull girls off their boyfriend's arms, and he looks for every opportunity to belittle me, call me ""creepy"" when I'm chatting with girls, etc. He's my favorite guy to go out with, not only because he's challenging, but he's saying this all from a good place, he's just trying to little brother me. I now have him completely pumping up my value to girls through a little bit of basic dog training. Whenever he made a joke I didn't like, I didn't acknowledge it, and didn't let it affect me. I just plowed through positively. I was working a 2 set once, and he started it, hard. I dropped a legitimate compliment on him, and something he's proud of and how he has helped me a ton in another area. There was no proper way to go about it other than complimenting me. Now he calls me cute to all the girls and throws value my way. We make an amazing team now. 
				 
**Other people’s states**
	
Not everyone is in the same state you are. There are the ""law of state transference"" or whatever, and yes, people take their emotional state from leaders in their environment. However, you're not a leader to these women yet, and your open might get blown out because they can't properly respond because they are not in the right state. Try going out a few hours later in the night, only an hour or two before close, or on the street in front of a bar. I have literally grabbed girls off the street and walked them into the diner next door. This is what Style meant to say when he said ""sometimes, the 7 hour rule doesn't apply."" Remember, you are playing a team sport against another team.		 
				
**Ecosystems** 

Get a second job that is primarily social. If you live in any big city, there are part time jobs that have this: retail, bouncing, street promos, sales, club promoting, bartending, whatever. When you're in a job where you have to preform, or you'll get fired, you'd be surprised how well you do.
							
**No matter what, you’ll make it work**

I have a 9-5, a 2-3 day a week night job, and night classes 2 days a week. I have a number of relationships, and I still go out. You know what dates I've been going on recently? 3 a.m. diner runs after I get off work for pancakes and coffee, also, coffee and reading dates, where I tell them to bring work in the middle of the day. Don't sweat what you do, make sure you bring her into your reality as soon as possible, my reality right now? Reading, and eating breakfast at 3 a.m.
				
**Drinking**

Drinking is fine. Being drunk is not. Being poor is not. If you can’t afford to drink? Don’t. Put your money where it is needed, a fucking savings account. Get used to gaming sober, order a club soda and lime, tip the bartender a dollar, and game on. If you can afford to drink? Awesome. Drink, but don’t get sloppy, and don’t get drunk. I firmly believe in mysteries thing on women being attracted to 3 things in a man: (**1**) A protector of loved ones, (**2**) a leader of men, (**3**) Preselected by women. When you’re drunk, you can’t be 2 of these things off the bat. I’m not saying it’s impossible, but don’t give yourself obstacles.
 			 

**Online game**

Seriously. I have no fucking idea, how do you guys do this shit?

Anyways, on my way home from work I realized I was walking behind her. I said her name to get her attention, no response. I notice she has ear buds in, so I tap her on the shoulder, and smile at her and say hi. She half-heartedly waves to me, turns around and keeps walking, not even taking her headphones out. I texted her a bit later saying that I'm sorry she didn't feel like chatting, and I hope she is doing well.

Some people would be sad or distraught...not I. I let her keep walking tonight, and re-realized something great.

Right after that harsh breakup, I took huge steps to improve my life. I got a job, stopped being a total stoner, got in better shape, started eating better, started going to therapy (this was big for me, I have C-PTSD), kept my room cleaner, started dressing better, and worked on improving my social interactions and being happy. I love myself and what I've become/will become, and I'm happy and comfortable with myself, to the point where I was perfectly fine trying to initiate conversation with a girl who I once loved deeply and who broke my heart. If she doesn't want to be friendly, that has no effect on me, my awesomeness is in no way related to her, it just shows that she isn't a very nice or forgiving person, and I feel kinda bad for her. I on the other hand, would be perfectly willing to be casual friends, even though I'm still hurt a bit by how the breakup went, because that's something that happened between two emotional, immature people, long in the past. Hell, if I had the same mindset when I met her as I do now, we would have never gotten into a relationship in the first place.

Seddit is a huge part of what encouraged me to make all those positive changes in my life and learn to be comfortable with myself while also improving myself, so here's a big thanks, I love this community a lot and it sucks that some people have a misguided view of what we are all about, which is self-improvement and being awesome. Because of you guys, something that would have made me feel horrible before just made me feel more awesome about myself. People go to r/breakups or r/relationships to get over a breakup, and I seriously don't know why, because what I learned here is 100x better than anything I could learn by wallowing in those places and fixating on the past. This subreddit is about the future, my awesome future, and things I can do to make it better, and tonight I guess I just realized it fully when I saw a girl I had loved and instead of feeling angry or sad, I was just my normal, friendly self and didn't really care that much.

Also the fact that I had hot sweaty sex with a much better looking girl last night doesn't hurt :).

**EDIT: Thanks for all the critiques and compliments people, I'm glad I can inspire some of you and that others are looking out for me, thanks. To be completely honest about one aspect that a few of you are focusing on, the inistial approach, I do initiate conversations with people, even those who I've had falling outs with, because I don't like having enemies, this is to demonstrate that I have no ill will towards them. I've done this before with ex-friends and will keep doing it if I run into someone I knew before, because people do tend to grow up bit by bit and it's definitely worth it to check in and see how they are doing, why dwell on past shittiness? It's nothing to do with lowering value or seeking contact, for me, it's about being decent and trying to be positive and friendly, even if there is no positive response. **

So what exactly is “nice guy syndrome”? For starters, it’s when you possess the following qualities:


•continually asking for permission 

•always at someone’s beck and call

•never saying what you want

•worrying what people think of you

•consistently walking on egg shells

•fearing rejection


So how do you change it?

**START BEING OUTCOME INDEPENDENT**

Easier said than done, I know. But it’s the only way to set yourself free. You will never attract a girl if you keep playing the role of the nice guy. All it will do is keep you in the friend zone. The friend zone is one of the worst places to be and quite difficult to get out of. Avoid this trap at all costs. So stop overanalyzing the outcome of your actions. Instead:


•Tell a woman how you feel.

•Do something for yourself.

•Take up space.

•Stop worrying.


**YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE AN ASSHOLE TO ATTRACT WOMEN**

Start having an “edge”. Instead of being the boring, nice guy that doesn’t get a girlfriend, be spontaneous and bold. Create new passions and hobbies for yourself. Get out of the same old routine. Change up your lifestyle. The reasons why so many “assholes” get hot women is because they don’t give a shit what people think of them and live a more exciting life. Nice guys aren’t doing that. So today I want you to:

-Find a new hobby.
-Buy something you’ve never bought before.
-Take a chance on something new.
-Tell the girl you like that you’re into her.

Once you do that, you’re on your way to a new beginning.

**TL:DR** - See title.

I'll be right back.""",452,91,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1cyybv/college_fr_hey_could_you_watch_my_things_for_a/,"I use this as an opener all of the time, especially for those girls who are just sitting around waiting for their class to start. Sometimes I go smoke, use the restroom, get some water, it doesn't matter. If they don't have a class within the next 5 minutes, they always agree watch my shit while I go do stuff out of their FOV. What's even better, 90% of the time when I get back from my ""break"" they've been thinking about something to say to me (usually something along the lines of ""you owe me"" which can be a fun statement to play around with). If not, the stage is set perfectly to ask something about what class they're waiting for or whatever.

This particular line is kind of specific to college campuses, but the theory is damn-near universal to its effectiveness. It is based around getting others to do favors for you, rather than the other way around. Why is this? Quite simply, it is because, generally, people love to have debts owed to them WAY more than favors done for them. Favors put the thought of ""Shit, how am I gonna pay this back?"" in the favoree's head, which is largely an uncomfortable feeling to have. No one like's being in debt for anything, and if the payment is optional (like the debt of a favor), unless the favoree REALLY likes the favorer, it will never be returned. 

Thanks to this notion, opening has been a total cakewalk. Obviously, there are some that this just wont work on (but really, why the hell would I want to chill with a girl who's too uptight to watch over someone's things for a few minutes?)

""Fake it 'till you make it.""

""Just do it brah, don't be a pussy.""

----------
Confidence.  It's what so many seek, so few have, and so many need.  It's the number one best way to pickup women.  You can look like Brad Pitt, have a gigantic penis, and be [swimming in money like Scrooge McDuck](http://tattoosales.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/blog13.jpg)

If you're not confident, however, none of this will mean anything.

Let's pull back and talk about what confidence is. 

If you want the TL;DR:
 **Confidence is you respecting yourself.**

It's that simple.  How can you expect anyone to respect you if you don't even respect yourself?

That's what is at the core of confidence.  You need to respect yourself to a level that others pick up on this and respect you.  That doesn't mean be intimidating and arrogant.  It means you need to intrinsically know that you are worth something.  

I'll spin this a different way.  


**What is a social interaction if not a presentation of yourself?**  How can you properly present a product that you have no confidence in?  You can't.  Go try to sell someone a sports car without wheels.  Exactly.  That's what a great person without confidence is.  Almost all of the pieces are there, there's totally potential, but the essential piece to allow progress is missing.  

See what I'm getting at here?


To have confidence you need to respect yourself. 

So why don't do you respect yourself?  Are you too skinny?  Too fat?  Not well-read? You're your own biggest critic and judge.  Figure out what you don't like.  Fix it.  Whether you need to go to a gym, read books, pursue a passion, learn a musical instrument, or anything else, figure out why you don't have confidence.



*Now let's talk about generating this confidence.  I'll even give you a shortcut*

""Just don't give a fuck,"" is some of the most commonly given advice in regards to getting confidence.  I'd argue that that is a result of confidence, not a path to getting there, and instructing someone to do that first is going about it backward.  Confident people just don't give a fuck.  If you're not confident, it's really hard to just flip that switch and start giving fewer fucks.  Rather than saying ""just don't give a fuck,""  you need a reason not to give a fuck.  If you're interesting, if you respect yourself, and you demand the respect of your peers through your very presence, you will have confidence.  

*But let's talk about a shortcut*

That's right, there's a shortcut.  If you can be interesting and know you're interesting, you can be confident.  What makes you interesting?  Nothing?  Go buy a guitar.  Go read a lot about a country and travel there.  Go with a buddy and camp out in the woods for a weekend.  Have an adventure and a story.

You'll see a lot of posts on here advocating ""just have a goal of having fun for the night.""  More often, my goal in life is ""have a great story to tell.""  See how that changes your life and gives you perspective.  

Be interesting.  Because you're so damn interesting you'll be confident.  Remember how confident the most interesting man in the world is?  Be that interesting, if not more.  


*This last bit is the most important part. * 

What is confidence?
A confident person respects himself.  That internal confidence is radiated outward, detected by others, who will give this confident person their respect.  

How do you get confidence?
By knowing you intrinsically have value.  Fix your flaws.  Become interesting.  Have enough life-experiences that you're awesome and you know it.

Good luck.  Hopefully this helps.

Not only does it give you the ability to bounce back from rejection, but it also gives you the ability to keep pursuing a girl after the first rejection. I'll give you an example, something that happened to me today.

I'm in my dining hall alone, and I spotted a girl eating by herself.

*Me: Hey, can I eat with you?*

*Her: Naw, I don't think so.*

If I didn't have a sense of humor, I would have probably walked off with a wounded ego. Instead, I sat down at the table next to her.

*Me: Hey, want to come eat with me at this table?*

*Her: Are you serious?*

*Me: It's a very cool table.*

*Her: Hmmmm, oh yeah?*

*Me: Yeah, it's like the plastics table from mean girls over here.*

*Her: Hahaha, okay.*

*Me: Thank god you got the reference. Now get over here before all the seats fill up (there were 5 empty* *seats)*

Anyway, turns out she was less interesting than a brick, and twice as hardheaded. I didn't even bother getting her number. My point is I pretty much got rejected twice and it didn't stop me. You will get rejected, it has nothing to do with your looks or your approach. However, if you keep your cool, keep your ego in check, and keep demonstrating that you're a fun person, it's really not that hard to meet people.

I can't do this and I don't think I'm willing to do this. This is going to be downvoted to hell but fuck it, I need to say this. 

I've never been good with women. I've had a few relationships, and one long term one which isn't bad for 19. I started college this past year and found I can't talk to people at all. SO I started lurking here about two months ago.

I was taught by my parents to respect women as complete equals. This is a large part of my problem. I have been lurking here for the better part of a month now and I hate the large majority of the advice you give. I know someone who is the embodiment of everything this reddit promotes, alpha, dominant, aggressive etc. etc. Hes incredibly successful socially and with women. 

I would like someone to kill this man. Hes always around since hes my roomate's best friend. I simply can't take the advice that you should assert your will over others, assume and act as if you are the center of the universe and be a domineering prick. It is against everything I feel a human being should be. It sickens me when others do it and I can't bring myself to do it to anyone else. 

I came here wanting nothing more than to improve my skills with women to the point that I could talk to people and maybe secure a girlfriend if an appropriate candidate ever came along, but what I hear makes me sick. I won't ever assert my will over another human being because I believe it is immoral. I don't want anyone else to assert themselves over me and so I don't do it to anyone else. You guys may be trying to help guys like me but I can't do it. If I have to sacrifice my ideas, morals and feelings on how I should treat other human being in order to get the social competence I want then fuck it. I will live by myself and only talk to my friends. Hopefully I can meet a woman who isn't attracted to the alpha male nonsense and still have the life I want, but I won't sacrifice the things that make me who I am for it.

Bring on the downvotes but I felt that I needed to share this. 



**Edit: Didn't expect such a response! I'm going to go ahead and try and answer the consensus of what people are saying since there are a whole lot of you commenting.** 

My problem is more with the kind of advice that is given across all situations. I don't like the way I have to respond. The link in the right to shit tests is a good example. All of the ""Alpha"" responses, which are quite obviously meant to be the ones your supposed to go for, are just about ego-maniacal. I find such responses in any situation to be rude. I can't even bring myself to say them, even when they flit through my head during conversation and are particularly witty. 

Alot of you guys have assumed that I am a weak sensitive nice guy. Thats partly true, because I always do my best to treat women with respect and be a gentlemen, it was how I was raised, but I am not weak. The alpha male I mentioned before (Mike) has incredible social standing in our dorm/social community. I disagree with Mike on fundamental levels that make our personalities fundamentally incompatible. I have stood up for myself plenty of times in front of people who would all have his back if he were to try something. I have threatened to kick him out of my room when he has said particularly nasty and immoral things about me and other people. I'm certainly not weak, I assure you this. 

Another thing alot of commenters are saying is that I don't have to be an ass in order to be good with women. It seems to me that certain responses and mindsets given in this subreddit are bad. I don't like egotistical replies, or stupid quips about how awesome you are. I find it incredibly arrogant, and its the main thing I was talking about in this post. I'm not out to dominate people, that would violate my own ideas of what being an equal is. 

I'll try to reply to people in person a little bit now, thanks for all the responses guys! Hopefully you can change my mind.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_okrtn,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/okrtn/i_dont_think_i_can_do_this/,

Little bit of background, I'm not new to any of this and in all honesty I'm very good at reading people, but I suffer from some pretty crippling social anxiety and I rarely get opportunities like this.  All my previous hook-ups and relationships have been through social-circle but I moved across the country by myself a couple years ago and have not developed much of a new one.  

So anyways, this chick I had oneitis for who used to work with me (Redhead) invites me to go out with her new co-workers.  I say yes but as the time to go approaches I get nervous.  I'm going to make an excuse and bail like I always do.  Last minute I sit myself down and say fuck it, I'm going.  

I get there and it's awkward as anything.  I don't know anyone, she's 3 doubles in and pretty drunk already.  It's 5PM.  

The boring people start to leave and we make our way to a bar.  I finally start to socialize more, taking the initiative and introducing myself to people.  At some point 28-year old, backwards cap, douchbag comes in and steals Redhead away.  I'm choked.  People start to console me.  They can see that I have oneitis for this girl.  That I'm a little bitch!  


My mindset changes and I leave the bar with a cool couple and their friends to go to another location.  At this point I'm pretty drunk because I haven't eaten and have been drinking for 7 hours.  I also am now solely with people I met that night.  

We go to this new location and I immediately start introducing myself to new people.  My social energy is skyrocketing.  I meet this girl and we hit it off.  I take her hand and bring her to the bar for a drink and to get some 1on1.  Some asshole comes out of nowhere and steals her away quickly.  I see she isn't down with this guy so i say, Yo dude, this is my girlfriend.  Maybe he knew her, maybe he was talking to her earlier, I don't know but he says, No she isn't, prove it.  I look at HB7 and smile, silently letting her know what's coming.  She smiles back and I go for the kiss.  We don't look back at the dude.  After that she was mine, and I knew it.  We ended up at her place and fucked twice that night and once again in the morning.  Later on I found out she works with Redhead.  

This experience taught me a lot.  I've been much more confident lately.  Since then, I've tried getting with Redhead.  I got her to my place but I couldn't seal the deal.  I've decided to drop her, as it seems she only uses me when she needs attention.  

Another fun thing:
I puked on HB7's bathroom floor.  Lol what a tool, I know.  I mopped it up with toilet paper and her bathmat.  I then walk back into her room, stark naked and announce, I just vomited.  She says she knows.  I tell her I made a mess.  She says thats okay.  I ask her to grab some mouthwash and join me in the shower.

In the morning I surfed through her PVR and found every episode of Duck Dynasty.  SCORE!  Watched that till she woke up, she was shy at first so I had to tease her and be playful for a bit but she loosened up and we got down to business.  Got her number before I left and went on my way.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_1b7if8,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1b7if8/hb8_ditches_me_i_bang_her_hb7_coworker/,

Note: Section 1 is written in a way to give you a mental image of the man you will become as you progress in your self-development. Revisit this post often, the truths contained within will become increasingly evident as you go on your journey. It is designed to provide you those ""Aha!"" moments as often as possible.

---

*Buckle up and get ready for the ride of your life. Embrace and practice the steps in these nine sections and you will become the man you've always wanted to be. What follows is a glimpse into your future...*

---

**1) You cherish women.**

You are genuinely delighted by women. You cannot help but celebrate their beauty. You aren't afraid to show flashes of vulnerability - you are the ""bad boy with a heart"" that women fantasize about. You have incredible love and compassion towards women, but no neediness. You realize that all women desire passion, good sex and adventure. It is your mission on this planet to bring that to them - to make them feel sexy, loved and beautiful.

**2) You have a purpose in this life beyond her.**

You are on an eternal journey towards greatness. When you meet a beautiful woman, you gladly welcome her to come along for the ride, but you are unwavering on your commitment to your journey. You understand the fundamental truth that women don't want to *be* the adventure - they want to be *taken on* an adventure by an attractive man. You are that man.

**3) You understand that honesty is the greatest aphrodisiac.**

With great power comes great responsibility. You understand to your core that her heart will be broken if she ever feels manipulated by you. You literally have the power to color all her future interactions with men. As such, you demonstrate supreme desire without a drop of presumption. You make your intentions clear. She will never put you in the friend zone. You approach authentically. You leave her better than when you find her.

**4) You make no apologies for who you are.**

You make no apologies for your values, your identity, your actions, or your desire. You avoid verbally defending yourself when challenged or tested, because to defend it is to validate it. You base your entire existence in honest intent. You need not apologize for nor justify anything in your life, as long as it comes from a place of authenticity.

**5) You never take things too seriously.**

You are immensely confident, to the point where you can laugh at her, yourself, and the situation. You live a life of self-amusement. You have no qualms being self-deprecating in your humor as appropriate. You are a master of the trollface. Your confidence will shine through. All around you will know that you are a [modern alpha male](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/). You are used to winning on an epic scale.

**6) You are a master of body language.**

You've studied body language in detail. You've practiced and dedicated hundreds of hours perfecting your craft. When you approach a woman, you can confidently focus on her like she's the only girl in the world, using your body to do most of the talking. You are a master of the full-body smile, eye-contact, and taking up space. Tales of your presence will be heralded for all ages.

**7) You've eliminated all limiting beliefs from your life.**

You understand the difference between ""good-looking"" and ""attractive"" to your core. You make no excuses for your faults and succeed in spite of them. You've been handed the blueprint for success and you've used it.

**8) You are unique.**

You have eclectic interests, hobbies and opinions beyond the average person. You are learned. There will be plenty of people who see things differently from you, but this does not bother you. Above all else, everyone you encounter in life will think, ""Wow, who is this man? There's something about him...""

**9) You've eliminated mediocrity from your life.**

You fully understand that women are sick of mediocre men. You have taken steps to remove all mediocrity from your being. You've transcended what you ever thought was possible.

---

**Action Items**

1) Go someplace relaxing where you can be all alone. Bring a pen and a notebook. Ponder deeply and visualize the man you want to be 90 days from now. Catalog your life and remove anything and everything that doesn't fit this new image you have for yourself. Write this all down.

* Examples: Stop wasting time playing pointless video games, stop watching useless TV, stop pointless web browsing. Cut out friends who harm your self-image.

2) Identify what behaviors you need to add to your life to become the man you hope to be in 90 days. Add them immediately.

* Examples: Enrolling in classes, reading fine literature (go get a library card), joining a gym and going, studying for the LSAT.

3) Read and apply the other 8 sections of this guide.

4) Revisit this guide every 90 days and continue to repeat steps 1-4 until you can confidently state you are the man you always hoped you would be.",Comprehensive,False,,t5_2qhrv,1374516659.0,,,True,t3_11piau,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11piau/above_the_game_part_1_primer_on_who_you_will/,moderator
1370452593.0,352,self.seduction,1fqdfc,Girl's perspective: how to avoid needy/clingy girls,499,147,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fqdfc/girls_perspective_how_to_avoid_needyclingy_girls/,"Guys often bring up needy/clingy girls as a big turnoff but I feel many times, they may not realize their behavior actually makes a girl more desperate than normal.

If a girl is desperate with everyone, there are very early warning signs so obviously stay away. 

But from my own experience and observations of friends, girls who are ok get clingy, such as texting too much, etc. when the guy shows mixed signals. Obviously a girl who is really strong would just end it but girls tend to hang on when they feel there's some hope he's interested. 

**Mixed signals include:**

- Treating her really nice, looking like having a great time when you two hang out but sporadic contact in between dates

- Taking less initiative than before but still seeming very interested when she talks to you

- etc. etc.

Most of the time, when a guy acts like this, he's dating a couple people, playing the field or not sure what he wants. But girls tend to want exclusively dating early on, if she likes you and especially after you guys have sex.

So if you are still keeping your options open, you need to be honest about it. Girls tend to hold onto hope if she's emotionally attached to you until you explicitly say something.

Being honest about your feelings and what you want is something that both guys and girls struggle with because we all like to have the safety net of backups or to keep options open if we change our minds. 

But our behaviour actually ruins the dating experience for both people. We can make the other person desperate, making them less fun to be around. We get worse at realizing when someone is really great because we're busy with stringing along a couple of options and trying to keep all their interest.

**Bottom line:**
When someone starts to act desperate/clingy, instead of writing them off, look at your own behaviour too. If you are just lukewarm about someone or you don't want anything more serious, be honest. You're acting based on a ""scarcity mindset"" to need to keep people you aren't that into around.

1359568282.0,350,self.seduction,17klsb,[FR] What turned out to be the wildest night of my life. (The following weekend/Update) ,449,99,163,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/17klsb/fr_what_turned_out_to_be_the_wildest_night_of_my/,"A couple weeks ago I made a post entitled ""Somewhat of an FR"" and ended it with a cliff hanger so to speak. Someone asked me how it went so I figured I'd type up an FR about the following weekend.

If you didn't see my other post, let me catch you up to speed. I approached a girl on our college softball team (forgot to mention that in my last post). I'm on the track team so a lot of the athletes know each other. This made approaching her really, really easy because she was wearing a hoodie with our universities logo and it said ""Softball"" in big, block print. I ended up getting her number and made plans to hang out with her back at my dorm a couple days later. And that's when the greatest sexual fantasy of my life started to be built.

We ended up not hanging out those couple days later, but I was completely fine with that. We both were swamped with homework, but **she** asked if **I** wanted to go out with her and her ""girls"" that weekend and have a good time. Bingo! I was in. Any anxiety I had was gone. She asked **me** to hang out. She was interested, or so it seemed, and I was feeling great.

Friday night came and I was ready to go. I recapped some of my favorite shit tests here from Seddit, flashed over my notes that I've taken over the past couple months (yes, I have a Seddit Word document saved), and slapped confidence all over myself. I drove over to her place and met up with her and her friends. They had already started pre-gaming and I had already established that I wasn't going to drink and be DD. I didn't want alcohol to be my crutch that night, this was going to be my night. I wanted to wake up in the morning and say ""I did ALL that in a natural state"" and know that I have the ability and confidence to do what I did with every girl.

So after about 30 minutes of chilling at her place, crackin a couple jokes and using a couple shit tests, she slid me the directions to the party we were going to. We arrived, walked in and it was on. I had the biggest smile on my face, stood up tall (I'm 6'5 and often times slouch a little), and started greeting people I had never even seen before. It caught everyone's attention. People were coming up to me later and introducing themselves. Most of these guys being football players, we talked our college athletics. A couple of girls approached me as well. I didn't initiate any kino with them, but I did however flirt a little as my date that night watched. I kept eyeballing her to read her body language. I could tell she was digging the fact that a lot of people we're attracted to me and I was hers that night. After about 5 to 10 minutes of conversation, I grabbed my dates hand and said, ""Let's light this place up."" We started dancing and it was on. The fact that she had consumed alcohol probably had to do with some of her dancing, but I didn't care. I was on a natural high and completely sober, taking in every bit of this awesome sauce. 

I have to add that this girl has ass for days, especially for a white girl. She can also dance pretty well and can get a little dirty, but still keep it classy. This really turned me on.

We danced a little while longer then she took a break to go check on her friend who was absolutely obliterated drunk. This was a good time for me to get some water and mingle with other people. Met a couple other guys who said I looked to be having a damn good time and even asked for some poitners. People asking **ME** for pointers? What in the flying fuck was going on?!?! That's when it hit me. All of this was happening because of confidence. Literally, that's it. None of these people knew me. I had never even seen half of them around campus. There had to have been close to 100-130 people there and when I walked in at least half of them looked just because of the way I carried myself and didn't have a care in the world.

She came back and wanted to dance a little more, which I was obviously not opposed to, so we did. She stopped and turned around and grabbed my shirt and pulled me in, we made out for about 5 minutes. I was purposely waiting for her to make the move cause I had a pretty good shit test I wanted to use. After we got done kissing I facepalmed and she asked what was wrong. I told her my girlfriend would be so disappointment in me right now. Guys, the look on her face was priceless. It was a literal Kodak moment, folks. She looked like she had just seen a ghost.
I quickly exclaimed ""PSYCH!"" and she playfully smacked me and laughed and yelled ""That's so not funny!!!"" Then she grabbed me again and pulled me in. She whispered, ""Come with me..."" and did the ""come here"" finger movement. At this point, I'm asking myself if this can get any better. She pulled me to the stairs (which were pretty secluded) and we started making out. Honestly, I would have fucked her right there, I didn't care. Things were getting pretty heated until some jackass decided to come down the stairs to go outside for a breather and stepped on us. Given, we were on the dark, secluded stairs, so I can't get too pissed.

We got up and hung out at the party for about another hour. There was a girl fight (which was pretty badass) and the cops showed up twice, but didn't do anything. Then we peeled out, dropped her friends off and drove back to her place. She was starting to sober up so after her friends were dropped off, we talked for a little bit about school, sports, the night, everything. We made out a little bit more as well. I was completely content with not laying into her that night if the opportunity didn't present itself. I had already broken my wall of AA down completely and took the tips I had learned here and put them into practice.

Who was I kidding....
I was as hard as a box of jawbreakers. Fuckin' A I was going to lay into her. I had done so well all night and this would be the icing to the cake. All I needed was the invite to stay the night. I simply told her it was cold so let's take out kissing inside where it's warm. She agreed so we moved inside. Her roommate was in on the couch asleep so I said ""Looks like your bedroom will have to do, daaaaaarrrnn!"" and I smiled at her. She kissed me, smacked my butt and said, ""Let me see what'cha got!"" I took that as a challenge and took it to her room. 

I want to stop here and inform you all that I hadn't been laid in almost a year. My game was being completely reconstructed. Even when I was getting laid, it was petty high school sex on the back seat of a Dodge Neon (I'm a hardass, I know). It wasn't anything crazy or fun, just basic, missionary position sex.

I didn't realize what I had gotten myself into. I had found a flower in a garden of weeds and I was about to find out why I think that now.

We made out on her bed for about 30 minutes as our hands explored each other. I was so ready to go, I felt like I was in 6th grade again. I kept my composer and, even though I wanted it bad, still teased her and kept acting like she wasn't going to get anything. This drove her wild, guys! Try it sometime. Let me remind you, she's sobered up by now and she wasn't trashed to begin with, just a little tipsy. 
At the beginning of the night she had told me ""I'm not gonna be as easy as you think"" and winked at me. Sooooo to reciprocate, she started to take my belt off, I grabbed her hands, pinned them behind her head and whispered ""Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna be *'that easy'*"" and started kissing her neck. Her body started to contort in ways I had never seen before. She was so ready to go and I wasn't sure how much longer I could resist. 

I went down, kissing her all over her stomach and chest. I took her shirt and bra off (again, I'm a badass, I know, bras can be tricky) and started nibbling a little bit. She couldn't handle it any longer. She ripped her pants off, ripped my shirt and pants off and I went down to eat her out. I incorporated some techniques I had heard on /r/sex and they worked like a charm. She was drenched, I was rock hard, shit was about to get fuh-reaky!

Then it hit me......
Holy shit. No. What the fuck. What was I thinking, I didn't have a condom on me. I couldn't fuckin leave after all that without fucking her. I couldn't leave and go to the store after the engine was already started and warmed up (even though, in literal terms, that would make sense). I whispered to her, ""I don't have a condom."" I was super hesitant about saying this thinking it would kill everything that just happened. She chuckled and comically shook her head and replied with, ""Boy, I'm on the shot. Please, just plow me""

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Fireworks went off in my head/testicles. The one thing every guy hooking up with a girl wants to hear. I was about to go bareback on this HB9. 

We went on to have the wildest, kinkiest sex I'd ever had in my life, which wasn't a lot. The sound of skin pounding skin echoed in this girls room. I only lasted for about 4 minutes but didn't give a shit. I exploded all over her and she loved it. We cleaned up quickly and she climbed on top. This was the first time I'd ever been more horny **after** I had ejaculated then I was before. It was also the first time I'd had a girl ride me who knew what she was doing. 

I was in paradise. We were being serenaded by The Weeknds ""Trilogy"" album and sweating like apes. We went at it for a good two hours **at least**. We both got off a good 3 or 4 times. It was completely and utterly in tents. We still have sexy times every now and then and it's a damn good time, every time.


Here's why all of this happened:

1. You guys. Seddit. You guys gave me so many good tips to do that actually work. I love you guys.

2. Confidence! I know everyone says it, but for reals, confidence is key. When you tell yourself you feel good, miraculously, YOU FEEL GOOD. Go out and not care. Be a boss, tell yourself you're fuckin awesome, whatever you have to do to make yourself feel good and be in a good mood. Forget the world and your problems that night and focus on the prize.

3. I was myself. When you're being yourself in your own skin, you don't feel uncomfortable because you're just doing you.


Thank you Seddit for everything and taking the time to read this if you did. I tried to cover everything as best I could. Good luck to everyone on their game!


TL;DR Met a girl in a class, ended up going out with her on the weekend and she showed me the craziest night of my entire life.

Me from several months ago would have just spent the rest of the semester staring at her from afar and never considering the possibility that she could ever want to speak to me. Today I decided not to let myself down like that:

I come early to class today to scope out the situation, I want to sit next to this girl. I subtly walk around and chill in the back, waiting for a sign of her. A few minutes before class, she enters, sits down, and I am quick to follow. She sits down with her female friend directly to her left. A guy is entering the row and I am worried sick that he might take the seat to her right. Thankfully, he continues further into the row, leaving me with the golden opportunity.

I sit next to her and am about to begin a conversation, but she is talking with her friend and I swear she mentions something about having ""slept at Luke's"" the other night. My nerves kick in and tell me ABORT!, she must have a boyfriend, why would she want to talk to me anyway?, I must be a moron... the usual stream of approach anxiety. I feel like no matter how fast my heart is pumping me with oxygen, it's not enough. Before I can come to my senses, class begins, she is diligently taking notes, I might be on the verge of cardiac arrest, and worst of all I have still said nothing to this girl.

Halfway through the lecture, I adopt a new attitude. All I need to do is interact with this girl. If I can do that, no matter the outcome, I have succeeded. I KNOW I will be infinitely happier with a rejection than having not tried. No matter how many times you can say this to yourself and understand it rationally, you need to practice at it so it becomes internalized emotionally. The first times are very difficult but you have to dive into it like a cold pool before you get over approach anxiety. I'm still in the early stages of this but the improvement is already noticable.

I recall this [field report that I read](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/10mve2/fr_class_game_number_close/) and decide to use the same strategy. I scrawl a tic-tac-toe board and make my first move. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I nudge her elbow with my elbow (kino anyone??), show her the notebook, and offer my pencil. She giggles. I can finally breathe. We make a few moves back and forth, until it's clear that we're going to tie (of course). She whispers ""it always ends in a tie."" I overtly cheat, I erase her last ""O"", substitute an ""X,"" and suddenly I'm the winner. ""Not today,"" I said, and showed the paper to her. Another giggle. There are about 10 minutes left in the lecture. Now I wait, I know what my real finishing move will be...

Class ends and once we are packed up, I stand upright, confident, look her in the eyes, and say ""I know this is out of the blue, but do you want to get coffee soon?"" (I am curious whether prefacing it with an acknowledgement that my request is random is OK or if I should just jump to the question. Maybe it doesn't matter.) Inside I am already ecstatic, relaxed, and feel as though I don't even care what her reply is-- I did the impossible-- I asked out this random hot girl I was fawning over. She seems happy and says ""Of course!"" Mind you, this is basically our FIRST verbal interaction. We exchange digits and I go on my way.

1362501178.0,347,self.seduction,19powj,"Inner game, moving past the good guy persona, and the importance of cutting her off",420,73,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/19powj/inner_game_moving_past_the_good_guy_persona_and/,"Hi everyone, about myself I am a 25 year old Promotional manager and photographer for one of my cities largest bars. I state this as, the position I am given allows me to interact with 1000's of people weekly. I see the game on the inside, and hopefully with knowledge i can help everyone else.

This will be brief but hopefully help those of you, who struggle with being the good guy and not ending up with the girl that you want or feel like u deserve. 

Let me the first person to tell you, you do deserve the chance to see the women you are interested in. 

I am often reminded of the story I read randomly from some romanticism literature i picked up in a library. 

The story was a medieval piece  about a princess who collected knights from all around to come and carry out the tasks of the kingdom in hopes of one day gaining her love. 

There were dozens of knights, and the only contact they had with the princess was when she issued her orders. The knights would go out, and each time they came back there would be less to take the next order.

Each task became more difficult and challenging to the knights resolve. The weak fell fast and soon there was only one knight. When he was left as the final champion he approached the princess for her final task. Her Final task she stated was 'You may never talk to me again I never wish to have a partner, but have you as my guard.'
The knight, accepted his task and stood silent next to his princess for the rest of their days. 

Now romantic literature always had that twisted plot, so i like to add my own.
In mine the knights says, excuse me miss, but good day, and leaves. The princess was left confused and dishearten, how could someone so loyal and so good disobey her?

The kingdom, soon fell under a dreary time without the knight to carry out the princess's tasks. 

She sent out a request for the knight to be back. He was now in the position of control. 

Now you as the reader can take this in several ways. You can take it as being that best friend to the girl you like and staying in her life on her demands, or being the knight that walks away and regaining the relationship you really desire.

This story is a classic example of the push pull attraction but reversed, that many of the mpuas talk about. Now, the problem with the knight is he wants to create a perfect world for the princess. He's to good. By doing all the tasks the princess demanded she believes she can have him and still live the life that she desires, but with out him being apart of it.

Now the push comes when he leaves. By telling the princess, ""nope see ya i played your game, have a nice life"". He has reasserted his dominance. He creates a mystery and a longing in the princess's mind, because how could someone so faithful turn and leave me like its nothing. 

Now this is what you need to do if you find yourself in a situation with a girl that isnt what you want. Be able to walk away as if it were nothing. She treated you poorly, you didnt get what you want, now leave.

Because only once you have lost everything are you free to do anything. 
Tyler Durden

For me this has always been a tough issue, because I say to myself, wow she is soo great and i really like this girl, maybe things will work out. 

It never does. The Friendszone is a comfy place to be, but the true Heroes never get there or stay there because the fight is what made them courageous. 

Think of the positives, of walking away. Before maybe you were afraid of starting new relationships with other girls, because the previous girl may have gotten jealous and wouldnt like you. Now you can say what you really meant and not feel like it may damage your relationship.

In this way you can be direct again. And being direct is the essence of becoming attractive. 

There have been several times in the last few months where things werent working out, or I wasn't getting the attention i desired and I cut off the relationship. I did so politely by stating why I am doing so, Example: ""sorry tiffany, but my heart tells me i have more feelings than what we have, and right now you are not able to meet them, so i feel like we should end things, so i dont lead you on or mix our feelings and hurt you.

Now by saying this i have used language to make it sound as if im in control, ie : I dont' want to lead you. Even though the girl was leading me on. 

Now i was faced with some intense repercussions and spiteful responses from a few of the girls, but when that happend I threw down the hammer of all lines. 

'Thanks for being honest"", 'Have a nice life'. Block on facebook and end contact.

Now 80% of my cuts have had girls texting me, calling me, finding me just to come back within weeks after the calling off. 

The other girls, i dont talk may not like me, or some of them I know dont have enough confidence to reunite on their own. Which is fine, shy girls have great personalities too, but they too have the ability to lead you on. Now for those, after a month or so, you may be able to reconnect on your own. 

The best way to reconnect if you are attempting too, is by being in places to be seen in a mutual location. IE parties, entertainment venues. This is because it will be by chance, and not a look of desperation or regret by you connecting again. 

Now if you dont think you will see her again, well.. why? Hopefully you are active and had a relationship that shared mutual interests. 

If not, then that will be left up to my next post. Creating Inner game and focusing on creating a lifestyle that is attractive. Hopefully that post will give some insight on how to give yourself confidence and happiness outside of the pursuit of women. Remember the most attractive thing to a woman is a partner who has goals,ambitions, and hobbies.

It started with the (relatively innocuous) mistake of playing the ""who's the hottest girl you know"" game on facebook, which of course led to the ""which of these girls have you hooked up with"" game, which then led to a rapidly escalating series of events:

* Her saying some of the girls I'd hooked up with were beat (true)
* Her saying I therefore had no game
* Her expressing her curiosity as to how I ever hit on girls

Fastforward to this weekend, we're out with my two roommates who are both single. One of whom is a perfect example of a guy who's great on paper but is absolute bollocks with women--he's a ripped semi-pro soccer player, has a great job in advertising, and dresses like he belongs on the cover of GQ. To top it off, he's from England and has the accent! For fuck's sake!

We're all sipping our drinks and my two roommates start lamenting the dating scene here, the Brit being especially frustrated with his lack of luck despite his impressive CV. My girlfriend not-so-innocently decides she needs to see me ""show them how it's done"" and issues a challenge.

Mind you I have absolutely zero interest in hitting on girls at this point. This community (among other things) got me a girlfriend who is absolutely perfect for me. Still, when she's gone to the bathroom (""You guys better all have numbers when I get back!"") I ask the two gents behind me to come with and approach a group of three girls who I'll describe as late-20's early-30's and probably an 8, a 6, and a 4 (tall skinny black haired Eastern European, tall thick blonde, average size brunette).

My line? ""Hi. We're here to hit on you."" (Massive grin)

I could see minds being blown. My roommates stood agape. The girls started laughing immediately and asked not our names but who we were (a subtle but I think important distinction). One of them exclaimed it was ""the most direct thing she's ever heard from a guy,"" and I, in the advantaged position of being taken, dropped a ton of ""who gives a fuck, this is hilariously absurd"" lines, including:

* ""OK, OK, let's skip the boring formalities and get names.""
* ""You in the back, you seem cynical about this whole 'we're hitting on you' thing.""
* ""We obviously just made your day.""

The game ended when I automatically put my hand on the small of one of the girls' backs (the cynical one, also the most attractive one) and felt the heat of a million suns hit the side of my face. My girlfriend had been sitting, legs crossed, watching the events unfold, the entire time.

I ran off to console her that I really wasn't interested and it was all a big show, but...guys, please, for the love of god, don't touch other girls. Don't do it. Even if your girlfriend tells you she thinks you suck at picking up chicks. Even if she eggs you on. Even if she thinks she can handle it. 

Postscript: after I left the group one of the girls told me roommates, ""Wow your friend is on fire! He just left with a really cute blond girl, he's totally going to get laid!""

EDIT: I just want to clarify that this was a playful interaction (for the most part) with me and my long term girlfriend.

I guess I will start at the beginning.  Me and a few long time friends were having a good night in a local college town.  We went out for a great steak dinner, and went to a cigar shop for some merchandise for later.  As we were finishing up, one of my friends got a text from his roommate saying that their neighbor was having a party and that we were all invited.  We finished up our transactions (I bought a few more cigars for the men hosting the party) and headed over to the house.

There were few people at the house to begin with around 10pm, so we went out front to smoke and get to know each other.  Before we knew it, we had finished the cigars, it was 11, and the house was almost full.  A few people peeled off to grab more drinks, while me and the rest of the owners of the house went back inside to entertain the guest.

That's when I saw my prey for the evening.  Tall woman in a little black dress.  Had a volleyball player's body.  Long brown hair down to the small of her back.  Big eyes and a beautiful smile.  When I saw her, she was mid-conversation with another PUA trying his hardest to get her attention.  She was having none of it.  The way you could tell? 

Her feet.  If you are having a conversation with someone and their feet are facing you directly, as in their toes are pointing at you, then they are engage.  If they lean against the wall with their legs crossed, even better.  If they face away from you, then you have not captured attention.

I went over there, stood side by side with her, saying, ""hey baby, sorry it took me so long. who's this?"" She played along long enough to dismiss this struggling PUA, then turned her attention to me.  We laughed and had a good time for a while, discussing how she actually did play volleyball.  I joked with her giving her reasons to date a volleyball player (Good on their knees, good with balls, etc.)

Everything was going great, but then she suddenly started getting distracted again.  Looking around the room, just being aloof.  In the middle of conversation while she was looking around the room, I took a step in closer, placed my palm on her cheek, and turned her head back at me, saying, ""I'm much more interesting than whatever is over there sweetheart.""

Her eyes.. oh god her eyes.  She gave me the eye fuck, while flipping her hair out of her face and flashing me a cute smile. She turned her lips towards my hand, curling into it in the cutest way possible.  She was on the line now.  

Next move?  Leave.

I love playing hot and cold.  Right after this, I took my hand off her face, laughing about how most women hate having their faces touched.  Her response? ""Something about you.  You must be good with your hands.""  I laughed, then grabbed my phone, saying that my other friends were back with more drinks and said that they needed help.

Went to find my other friends, and played wingman for about a half an hour with a few friends.  I look around, and who is standing against the wall, staring right at me, waiting for my return.  Ohhhhhhh boy.  

We were running low on ice, so I went upstairs to grab more from a fridge in one of the guy's rooms.  I turn around and my lady friend is standing in the doorway.  Walks in the room, right to my ear, and whispers, ""I'm much more interesting than your friends, don't you think?"" 

We make out.  She runs her hands down my chest right to my belt buckle.  Then she stops, pulls away, and smiles.  Then WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM.

Counter hot and cold with hotter and colder?  Sneaky lady.

At first, I was pissed, but then I thought of the situation, and understood her game.  It was beautiful.  Smart and beautiful.  A real HB.  

I go and drop off the ice downstairs, with my lady friend nowhere to be found.  Avoiding oneitis as much as I can, I go find one of my closest lady friends and strike a conversation with her.  We are really close friends, and have pretty much friend zoned each other.  So there is no sexual tension between us really.  But I don't mind.  All I need is my HB to see me talking to another woman and she will go bat shit.

Before I know it, HB is back, and she is pissed.  Going on and on about how she is so sick of guys like me and she has been played so many times.  This is the exact dialogue, I shit you not, channeling my inner Tony Stark.

HB: ""You are just like all the other cute guys I have met here.""

Me ""I guarantee you I am nothing like them.  Much more charming, witty, and intelligent.  Pretty much the entire package.

HB: ""Oh very funny.  You must play girls like me all the time, and then forget about them in the morning.""

Me: ""As much as I can.  Hopefully two or three a night.  Any less is a disappointment.""

HB: ""And you must not lose an hour of sleep at night do you?""

***WARNING: MOVIE QUOTE/KNOCKOUT PUNCH INCOMING***

Me: ""I'm prepared to lose a few with you tonight.""

Stopped her dead in her tracks.  My lady friend I was talking to didn't know what had just happened.  HB cracked a smile, grabbed my hand, and dragged me outside.  Made out again.  Whispered in my ear, ""Take me back to your place.""

Fun time overnight.  Got her number in the morning, as she said to me, ""Call me anytime and I'll be here.""

Very great night. A great lesson in hot and cold, body language, and rolling with the punches.  Enjoy.

I'm going to describe two different people... Think carefully if either of these guys' descriptions resonate with you.

---

**FRIDAY NIGHT**

Guy #1 texts a bunch of people asking where the party is. He gets no responses. He calls someone at 10PM. It's loud and they're at a bar. He wonders why he never got a text back about the bar in the first place.

---

**FRIDAY NIGHT**

Guy #2 has texts from 3 guys and 1 girl all inviting him out to different parties and bars. He heads to a bar with a co-worker for happy hour drinks. He rushes home to get showered and changed before having his pick of which parties to hit up. He gets a few texts from guys asking where the party's at. He decides not to respond because he's going out with a few guys already and doesn't want the boy:girl ratio to get thrown off. He gets a call at 10PM from one of those guys and feels bad he didn't text him back.

---

Why is Guy #2 getting invites while Guy #1 gets ignored?

It comes down to one simple concept: **GIVING VALUE.**

Guy #2 is outgoing. He's fun. He focuses on having a good time. He is not concerned about approach anxiety because he's out to have fun first and get laid second. Girls open him when they see him having such a good time. Guy #2 often invites other value givers to do things with him.

Guy #1 shows up alone or with other guy friends. He has high approach anxiety and it shows on his face. He is visibly uncomfortable and nurses his drink all night. He doesn't go out of way to speak to others. He goes home alone. Guy #1 often texts other guys (who he knows go out a lot and meets women) asking where the party's at. He often gets ignored.

---

If you relate to Guy #2, congratulations, you are a value giver. You'll have an easier time building and keeping a social circle.

If you relate to Guy #1, you are a value taker. You need to think about what you can contribute to others' lives, so that they'll be more likely to invite you out.

""Giving value"" can be as simple as:

* telling funny jokes
* coming up with fun things to do
* being very good-looking or dressed very well
* buying or bringing drinks/drugs/etc.
* bringing women
* being an awesome wingman
* pushing people out of their comfort zones
* the ability to get over one's approach anxiety
* being a fun, outgoing person

Try to be Guy #2. Become a value giver and watch your social life improve dramatically.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_lfr7f,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/lfr7f/on_giving_value_why_youre_not_being_invited_out/,

Long, but I hope it's worth a read",543,204,391,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1hhqun/fr_seduced_by_a_french_guy_girls_pov_long_but_i/,"I know girls don't have much say in this subreddit, but I thought I could contribute something. I'm sorry this is a bit long, but I tried to make it as detailed and helpful as possible for an FR

Introduction: Last week I met this French guy at a party. We went out on 2 dates, and although *technically* he f-closed me on the second one, practically, he f-closed me on the first one. His game was really natural so I paid close attention to what he did.

We met at a party where I got really drunk and (apparently) we made out. But because I blacked out, I remembered almost nothing. I wouldn't have known his name if he didn't put it in my phone.

So the next day I added him on Facebook, and asked if I could see him again. He told me, sure, we could go out for drinks. He also mentioned something specific that we talked about at the party (something like, ""then you can tell me more about the story of the butterfly""). Now that impressed me. I thought, ""this guy *listened*"". So maybe you can do that when you ask someone out after meeting them. 

Now, the date itself. At first I thought he was a little reserved. When we met, we did that kiss on the cheek greeting that the French normally do, and when we got to the restaurant, his friends were waiting. But we sat next to each other, on one corner of the long table, and we talked mostly by ourselves. When we got our drinks, he asked if he could taste mine. I thought it was pretty intimate, but because he asked, it wasn't creepy.

He sat himself in a way that he was partly facing me. Whenever I looked at him to say something or answer a question, he would be already be looking at me. It didn't even matter what we talked about (mostly random stuff like movies we've seen) but there was a lot of eye contact. At least more than my normal conversations with my friends (guy friends, maybe orbiters). He let me talk and he would ask something, and express agreement or suggest something that I should see or do, related to the topic at hand.

While we were eating, he tried a bit of kino by touching his leg firmly against mine. I figured he was testing if I was actually interested in him or was just way too drunk at the party to care (I didn't move my leg). Later he mentioned that he was tired and told his friends he wouldn't be coming with them to the club. He asked me if I wanted to bounce too, and I said yes.

So he's isolated me. He said, ""Before you go, let's go on a walk."" He put his arm around me without making a big deal about it and I responded naturally by putting my arm around him. We walked like that for a while, talking and giggling, him kino-ing a bit by touching my hair, my cheek and kissing me lightly on the lips. 

We found a place to have a beer. When we sat down, he just said, ""Sit closer."" He said it confidently, and I didn't protest. He continued to kino by running his fingers up and down my arm, holding my hand, and he escalated to kissing me on the neck and rubbing my back and waist, until eventually he went on to lightly caressing my inner thighs and putting his hand up my (short) skirt. By this time he was whispering things in my ear like ""I really want you to come home with me."" He didn't ask, he was definite about what he wanted.

I would have gone home with him that night, but logistics stopped us (so guys, be ready! always assume you're going home with someone after a date). He told me playfully we could do it in a bathroom stall or dark alley but I refused. Before we left each other, he told me he would really like to see me again (preferably the next day). I could come with him to this party or something. I didn't end up going, but we set up a date (via text) for the day after. This time I brought my toothbrush. :)

Now you might say I was already attracted to this guy. But remember, before he isolated me, we were mostly just friendly. Also, I was a virgin until I slept with this guy. So KINO, KINO, KINO. Escalate, escalate, escalate! And keep your interaction playful, light, and fun. During conversation, try not to use canned lines. Listen carefully, pick one thing she mentions and ask about that. It helps to keep everything organic.

TL;DR: Pay attention. Be confident. Be sexual early.

Hope this is helpful for someone. I read a post earlier asking if kino was still necessary even if attraction is already strong. So I decided to post this FR. (In short, yes, it is.)

Seddit is a wonderful resource for those alpha/extroverted people that just have a little trouble getting their foot into the door of the seduction game.  But for myself, I find that 99% of the people posting advice have no idea what it means to be a true introvert.

""You just gotta get out there.""

""Have balls and make a move.""

""Be confident, show you're happy with yourself.""

This advice is useless to me.  To me, an introvert, the end goal is not learning to seduce women into dating/sex, the end goal is learning to start conversation with strangers that I am sexually attracted to.  (After one can comfortably do that, I feel its just a natural progression to dating/intimacy.)  Yet most people on here treat this as the first step.  It is obvious to me that this subreddit is not geared toward beta/introverts, at least not true introverts whose largest fear is talking to people they don't know (not just girls, anyone).

If you're trying to make a post aimed at introverts, you have to start small.  Like really, really small.  When you say ""Well the first step is introducing yourself and getting yourself out there,"" I find that particular post relatively worthless to myself, and I suspect others as well.  

Introverts need the tiniest of baby steps.

For example, I got a piece of advice from a person a few days ago that a good starting place:

""Next time you go out ANYWHERE (which you should do right now), just say 'hi' and smile to ONE girl you think is attractive, then keep moving.  You do this, then you analyze how it felt.  Feeling game for a couple more hi's?  Great, go for it!  Felt too easy?  Escalate to asking them a question / starting up a very small conversation.  Felt nerve wracking and awkward?  That's fine, you accomplished your goal.  Go home, you're a winner, and repeat day after day until it becomes easy, then escalate.""

I feel that this is a great first step for introverts.  This is essentially the smallest first step one can take, and I think it's a great tip for intros.  If this is too large for someone, they probably need to go see a professional for some social help.

Well, that's all I wanted to say.

1343749786.0,345,self.seduction,xgc3u,I was trying to just mess with people and ended up somehow pulling in an HB7...,458,113,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xgc3u/i_was_trying_to_just_mess_with_people_and_ended/,"This happened this past weekend and to be honest I have no idea how.  I went to a house party and felt like messing with people.  So I get to this party that my friend invited me to.  I was in the mood to just fuck around and just mess with people.  


So there is this guy and girl making out right next to a high traffic area.  So I go up to them and just stare.  I keep a dead serious look on my face and just stand there slowly sipping my beer.  I do this because they where in a high traffic area.  I mean at least find a dark corner or something.  So after about 45 seconds or so (I guess they where really into each other) they turn to me and the girl says ""wow...you're creepy.""  


I looked her dead in the eye and managed to pull off a tear and tell her that I was sorry.  I then went onto this elaborate story of how I was 22 and had never been kissed.  I tell her how I was just curious and got lost in the moment of their passion.  At this point her guy friend is even feeling bad for me.  He chimes in ""Dude...how have you never kissed a girl before?  You're a good looking guy!  Try to talk to people and not just stand quietly and creepily at a party.""  I then told them that I tried to talk to girls but they usually cuss me out or throw their drink at me.  They looked really confused and asked what I was saying to these girls.  

So still holding this fucking perfect straight face I look them dead in the eye and say ""Well, I go up to a girl I like and I just say....Hey...want to suck my dick?""  The guy nearly looses it laughing and saying ""nonono man you can't just go up to a random girl and say that.""  I responded with ""But my friend says it to his GF all the time and it works for him.""  I have these two sold...I have no idea how.  I just assume they where drunker than they looked because I don't think I'm that amazing of an actor.  His female friend at this time says she's going to go get a beer. 

I turn to the guy and just say ""Man, you're lucky.  How do you get girls like that?"" He then tells me he read ""The Game"" (This guy still had no idea that I was not serious) and started talking to me about PUA and such until the girl came back with her friend.  Her friend was a very cute HB7.  So I guess girl number 1 told this girl the entire story because this girl was coming onto me with ease.  We start to talk and I keep up my virgin never been kissed act.  After a few minutes she leans into me and whispers in my ear ""You can kiss me if you want.""  I go in for it with tongue and all.  After we stop she looks at me and says ""Man, that was really good for your first time.""  I then look at her and said ""Oh yeah...that...I was just fucking with these guys.""  

At first she looked kind of offended because of this deception.  So then I look at her and say ""You can be offended and not talk to me anymore or we can hang out some more.  I don't care either way.""  Her friend just shrugged and HB7 agrees to talk to me/make out for a while in the corner.  After about 15-20 minutes of that my friends tell me it's time to go.  She gives me her number with out me needing to ask and I walk off with my friends.  As I was leaving I ran into the first guy who gave me a handshake and told me he thought my act was really believable and hilarious.  My friends also got a kick out of the story.

**TL;DR** I stared creepily at this guy and girl.  Told them I was a virgin and had never been kissed.  Girl brings me her HB7 friend whom makes out with me.  I tell girl truth when she says I'm really good at kissing for my first time.  HB7 gives me number.

Only do it because you want to entertain yourself. Eventually your subconsious will pick up things that are working. Never ever care about outcome at all. The only outcome is that you have done something. 

Let me give you some examples.

I was out with a friend last week and I told him to challenge me to anything. I wanted to just do something. He told me to go ask a girl if I could wear her scarf. Not the normal kind of scarf either. It was the flight attendant kind. I was like... hm... I would look retarded but who gives a fuck. Challenge accepted. I got a funny conversation out of it, practice, and had something to do for a few minutes.

I asked an older gentleman if I could have some of his popcorn because I was too lazy to get my own. I actually said that lazy part too. I got a funny conversation that ended up with him telling me he was a huge part in making the clubs around town and was looking to train a protege for the lighting stuff they put into clubs. 20 bucks an hour too. Do you realize how much social networking that gig would get me? I have kids so I won't be able to do it but I got my buddy on it. All because I said something stupid on purpose. 

I am looking to get a rise out of people for my entertainment. Sometimes it is a negative and sometimes it isn't. Honestly if the people are cool people you are going to get them joking back. Those are the people I want to talk to anyhow. 

* I ask blondes what their normal hair color is. That actually has always resulted in a postive conversation.

* I asked a group of girls if they wanted to have an orgy. That was a fun and positive conversation.

* I asked a girl if she was drunk enough to go home with me yet. Good conversation.

* I asked an asian girl if she wanted to go to a chinese buffet sometime. She said that we should.

Stop caring all together. If you care you will fail. The reason for people taking so long learning a new language? They are fearful of failing every single time they try a new word or sentence. They are even affraid of that in front of themselves. If you truely just give the fuck up caring you will enjoy yourself. 

**Life - You have non-refundable tickets to it.** Don't waste them. They were free but you never get them back when you die. They just keep on expiring as you get older and pass up the moments the tickets were for. Don't do that.

---

EXTRAS

**Someone has to be the leader in your life. It should be you.** For trivial things in life you should not let others dictate what you do. Just do things. If the outcomes bug you then stop doing what it was that fucked you over. If you enjoy the outcomes then keep doing it. Just do stuff. You don't have much time so just do it already. Nobody is going to live your life for you. Most sucessful people lead their own lives and don't have others lead them. Be a leader of your own life.

**Treat life like a new video game when you go out.** If you are a gamer you probably go try the new weapons, new tactics, and just balls out try to break the game. You know that doing this you probably will die and die a lot. The point isn't winning it is learning the game and having a fucking blast. Treat going out the same way.

**Who the fuck knows what is going to come out of what you put in.** Just keep shoving shit into the input and see what comes out the output. After a while you will get a good pattern and can just use that. You will disregard the crap and still keep pumping out new results. You can the trash and keep the good and keep on trucking. Who the fuck cares about garbage. It is garbage. NEXT that shit and just keep on keeping on and eventually you will be like, ""Wow, how the fuck did I get here. This is awesome. Let's break this game some more""

EDIT 2:

I want to share with you that since this epiphany I have been changing my rationality from: ""What is going to happen? *old shitty worrysome answer*"" to ""What is going to happen? *Who cares I only get this chance once so who gives a fuck.*""

When you start answering your worries this way you can rationalize almost any crazy action. So unless you have a solid answer of why you shouldn't the default should start being  ""**Who cares I only get this chance once so who gives a fuck.**""

I had the opportunity on Friday night to put them to the test, and it worked very well! 

*Also apologies for the wall of text, but I feel the detail is important as they were all key factors assisting the Seddit tips.*

So I went out with some friends (2 other guys, all 19), and we were walking through the main club/bar area in our city and I was stopped by a HB8 who asked me to take a picture for her and her two friends. I kindly obliged, and this is where it all began. At first the camera was on video mode, which i didn't notice immediately (I had a couple drinks already), and so when I realised and told them, it got a few laughs out of them, which helped to break the ice so to speak (instead of just taking a photo and leaving). After I had taken the photo, the girl who's phone it was came over to me to thank me and this is where I thought I'd give some Seddit tips a go. 

I immediately went in with some **kino**, put my arm around her and on her lower back when showing the photo to her, she didn't seem to mind. I then initiated basic conversation asking how her night was going etc. She responded well and asked some questions about myself, and I did the same for her, all while doing my best to maintain **eye contact**. She then wanted to take a picture with me and her friend, she introduced me to two of her friends, and again I thought this was a great opportunity for more kino, arm on her lower back again. 

At this point, her friends were sort of going in and out of the club looking for their other friends or whatever, and it seemed like they weren't sure where to go next or something. So I had now singled her out and was talking to her one on one, anyways HB8 asked where I was going with my friends next (yes, I was aware my friends were still waiting for me, but I had glanced at them a couple times when talking to HB8 and they were laughing mostly, but gave me a ""no worries, thumbs up, go for it gesture). I told her we were going to this club (lets call it Club A), and she must of been interested in me because she then said that she was going to go to a different club (lets call it Club B), and asked if I wanted to come with her. I thought this would be a good opportunity for some more simple advice from Seddit, the **push/pull** technique. I told her that I'd ask my friends if they wanted to go to Club B, but they were pretty set to go to Club A. So then I told her that I came out with my friends and I would feel bad if I left them so soon, so that I was going to go with them to Club A instead (the **push**). She seemed pretty disappointed by this and again asked me to come with her to Club B. I then responded by saying, ""Why don't you come with us to Club A?"" (the **pull**). She liked the idea, and said ""ok but we must still go to Club B later, I have friends i want to see there."" I was like sure, I actually didn't mind going to Club B, I just wanted to stick with my friends for a bit longer. Also her friends weren't too keen on going to Club A, so she went and said bye to them. 

The whole way to Club A I made sure to use lots of **kino**, hand around her back, on her lower back most of the time, standing near her and just chatting. Also periodically having a conversation with my friends instead of her for a bit, so as to slightly ignore her ( **push**). When we got to Club A, we all got a drink and sat near the bar, talking to each other and moving to the music a bit. Eventually my friends decided to play pool, as I was mostly talking to HB8. 

I was both surprised and pleased at this point that I had managed to convince this girl I only met like 15 mins ago to come with me and my friends to a club, and without her friends, so I felt this might actually go somewhere. So I asked my friends if it was cool if I left them to go to Club B with HB8, and they were totally fine with it, plus they were playing pool, so they were occupied. I then asked if HB8 wanted to go to Club B now, and she seemed excited that I initiated the question to leave with her (**pull**). She was the one leading the way there and again lots of **kino** on the way there, arm on lower back, or holding hands while she led the way. 

Upon arriving at Club B, it was now just the two of us, which was great for me. The Club was in a building with an escalator, and while on the escalator I made sure to get very close to her, face to face, while holding my arms around her, lots of **smiling and eye contact**. Just when were about to get off I went in for a **kiss**, and she made no resistance. I thought this was a good idea as I had read on seddit that you want to **initiate the sexual contact early on in the night, not at the end**, so now I had a baseline from which to work on. She wanted to go straight to the dance floor so we did and danced for a bit, I managed to get a few kisses in as we were dancing as well. After she needed to go to the bathroom and so we left the dance floor. When she came out I asked if she wanted to sit down somewhere and she agreed. We started making out, and quite furiously while on this sofa thing in a lounge area, and periodically chatted some more as well. 

She finally found her friend, and introduced me, and I chatted with him for a bit, (seddit tip: **engage with her friends**), and he was surprisingly extremely nice to me, he bought me two drinks throughout the course of the night there without me even asking for one from him. So her friend came and went, and we continued making out, and eventually the question ""so where to you live, and do you live at home"" came up. Unfortunately I'm home from college for the summer and so I am living at home, and I was very unsure about bringing a girl home. Apparently her place was out of question since her parents ""watch her closely"". But since I had taken it this far and sex was on the table, I said lets give it a go, but we'll have to sneak in and be quiet, and gave her a wink, and she was totally down for it. So we end up leaving and going back to my place and I sealed the **F-close**. 

We went at it on and off for and hour and a half, and it was almost 5:30am at this point, so we decided it was about time she left, before there was any danger of anyone waking up. Called her a cab and said said goodbye, sealing it with a kiss. 

**TL;DR** Random HB8 asks me to take a photo of her and her friends, I applied some simple Seddit tips, (**kino, push/pull, eye contact, engage her friends, sexual contact early on), and F-closed her at my place with my parents and brothers fast asleep in their rooms down the hall.

1364952049.0,342,self.seduction,1bk2gv,3 Steps to Creating Much Better Conversations,448,106,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1bk2gv/3_steps_to_creating_much_better_conversations/,"TLDR (If you are pretty social already, skip to step 3 and move backwards, this is designed for people that are really having a tough time.)

I found seddit about 3 months ago, and it amazed me how accurate it was.  I'm a little older than most people here, and I spent most of my teens and 20s focusing on being better socially, but not focusing specifically on women.  When I found seddit, it hugely improved my ability to close, but I already had a good social/conversational base down.  Here is how I did it, over a bunch of years.

STEP 1):  If you feel like you aren't able to get a conversation started and you need to go to a really basic step, first memorize 3 questions.  In college they are typically (What's your major?, What Dorm/Apt do you live in?  Where are you from?)  If you have AA, these are good enough openers to get you started.  Rarely will a women or random other person not answer one of these questions.  For noncollege (Where are you from?, Do they have any special drinks here? Do you know if it is supposed to rain tomorrow? etc. etc. write down 3-5 random questions,)

Go out, meet people, and make it a mission to ask 3 questions and get answers to them.  (feel free to try some conversation afterwards, but your primary goal should be 3 questions)  Once you get them in, ask more questions.  This style of conversation feels like an interview, and it won't get you laid nor will it get you to be the most social person, but it will get you started.  Once you can ask people those questions comfortably, move to step 2.

STEP 2):  After they answer the question, say something that relates to their answer and ask another question.   If they say they major in Philosophy, you say you major in (engineering or whatever your major is).  Then, ask another question.  This is radically more social than step 1.  Most people can barely do this well.  Once you get good at this, move to step 3.  

STEP 3):  Step 3 is where you become much, much more alpha and can really talk to people and be really social.  

Once you have 1 &amp; 2, and you can ask questions and talk a little about yourself, then you need some good stories.  Start by getting out a paper and thinking about anything you have done over the past few years.  Here are topics to start with:


A) Trips you have been on
B) How you moved to your current city
C) Anything that happened that is unusually you can think of
D) Parties you went to etc.
All the stories should ideally have a hint of DHV, but first you are just trying to come up with stuff. 

After you have your topics, write stories in bullet format:
Beginning
Middle 
End

Once you have a few stories lined up, hopefully at least 3, repeat step 2, but instead of just saying where you live, you would tell a story about when you moved in there and how your friends all helped you etc.  (stories should be short! max 5-7 sentences, long stories are terrible until you get really good at telling them.)  After you tell the story, you can go back to a question if they don't tell their own story.  

If you do those 3 steps, you will become a far, far better communicator and will likely be able to talk to anyone.  

***I read a book called Telling To Win, which was pretty good, but I'm sure there are better books if anyone has any suggestions. 

[ADDED]  In response to a few comments below:  Steps 1 and 2 are really for beginners or people who are struggling with making a lot of impact in their conversations.  Step 3, if you master it is exactly how the absolute best conversationalists work.  This isn't just about approaching women, this is also how men talk to each other.  Just like many of the other PUA/Seddit stuff out there, it starts in your head until you are more natural.  Once you are natural at this you no longer think in steps, you just tell stories, ask questions... then your realize you are having great conversations that lots of people want to be involved in.

1334536639.0,340,self.seduction,sbkn0,Women Have Changed Considerably in the last 10-20 years. An Older Player's Perspective...,427,87,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/sbkn0/women_have_changed_considerably_in_the_last_1020/,"This question was posed to an older player:

Can you compare women in 2012 to 10 yrs? 20 yrs ago? How have they changed since y'all were younger guys? Let us young players know how the game has changed.

Here was his response:

Oh yeah. Well for starters, the number one thing I've noticed is that flaking has gone off the charts since the 90s. It's at the point where girls that approach ME will still flake. In the 90s, any girl that showed any degree of IOIs was a guaranteed thing. If she gave you her number, she would answer the phone when you called, or return your call every time. You simply have to chase a lot harder now. It takes more work now than it did when I was in my early to mid 20s.

The era before texting, facebook and smartphones seems like a distant memory. I've forgot what it feels like to walk into a bar or club and not see half the women's faces pointed down illuminated by the glow of their iphone. This stuff has had a profound impact on the going out experience. They may be present, but their attention is elsewhere. Clubs are full of girls huddled together on the dancefloor taking iphone pics of themselves to instantly tag and upload to facebook. That shit was unimaginable when I was in college. Women actually went out to clubs to meet guys, not to be digital attention whores. 

Back in the 90's me and a buddy would hit a different small town about every weekend and pull with little effort. We'd just sit and bullshit and the broads would gravitate in our direction. We were often asked if we were married because we paid no attention to them. I rarely have this happen anymore. They are too busy texting and taking pics of each other.

As has been mentioned previous, I think the biggest change is the 24/7 validation broads get these days from FB and always being accessible via text. Fucking texting fucks up shit all the time now. You definitely didn't have to worry about a ""friend"" texting asking wtf her friend went while you were dragging her back to your fuckpad, let alone the same friend asking 20 questions via text while I chat her up at the bar.

They didn't get validated by useless chodes daily on FB or POF/OKC. They got validated by getting fucked well by me.

Also, BCP (before cell phones) the broads didn't expect to be in constant contact as it wasn't nearly as easy to get someone on the phone. This matters more with broads you've already plowed, but is definitely a big factor. Missing her call was no big deal. Now, if you don't call her back it's like farting with her head under the covers.

In short, I miss the 90's. It was so much easier doing hit and runs back then.... I've never considered what I do to be game, but it sure worked like magic back then.

Anyways, an older gentleman (we are mid 20's, he'd be pushing 50) came and had a chat to us. Now the thing was, every *good looking girl* that would walk past, he'd simply touch them on the shoulder and say 'You look fabulous tonight!' (if they turned away, 'I just had to tell you, you gorgeous girl!!!', if they continued... such a lad, had a quick chat and then directed them toward us), or ask how their night was and continued from there...


The point is, he was a master of not giving a fuck. I shared in this experience too, by watching, listening and replicating what he did. He truly inspired me to just grab a passing girl and chat. First Emily, then Courtney, Danielle, Rebekah.... Wow... This was a huge eye opener. 


Lessons learnt;

1. AA is what you make it. Dive in, don't give yourself a chance to self doubt.
2. Things go to shit, it was never shit. You were happy before, you're happy after.

3. When rejected (never if, always a when..) embrace it and have fun. Show her (and more importantly yourself) it really just does not bother you. After all, my goal for he evening was shooting shit w/ a friend, everything else a bonus.

4. Be happy and show interest! This was huge. Emily kept coming back to the bar and hovering like a fly around me, only because I struck into conversation threading and found topics of huge interest of hers, and expanded on them. It got to the point, she'd get to the bar right next to me, and just pull out her phone for 10s, and walk off and not order a drink. I know she was waiting for me to make a move / re-initiate a convo, but i didn't. Silly confidence issue I'm working on, but the interest was there.

5. I had the realisation, girls in that situation are dressed up for a reason, are just like us (somewhat shy and timid, want to have a chat and a little flirt and just meet cool people). WE ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL. No one is special in a scene like that. Fuck it, have fun.


Now, i didn't leave with a single number, got shut down a few times, but, thanks to Carlos, he showed me how easy it is to smash AA w/ a sledgehammer of playful banter. Literally, just say hi and have fun :)

Can't wait for tomorrow to do it all again!!!

I've been lurking here for too long and while I've been making subtle (and some accidental) approaches while drunk, I've actually never made a cold approach during the day.

Earlier today I was at the gym with two other friends. Super confident with my newly cut hair. Saw this solid HB8 brunette working there, smiled and said hi to her whilst waiting a few minutes for my friend on the treadmill. I'm thinking: ""I'm at home super confident saying to myself that there is nothing easier than to approach a random stranger and give them a compliment, why am I so nervous now?!"". AA kicks in big time and my heart starts beating faster. A few minutes later she goes back to what I think was a supply room on the way towards the second floor where the weights are. 

**Fuck it. I'm doing it. Look in to her eyes. Smile. You're the king of the world. It's go time.**

Me: Hi. I would regret not talking to you. I think you are cute.

She smiled or said thanks or something, can't really remember. 

Shook hands, exchanged names. I repeated hers (THANK YOU MYSELF, super good advice for people who forget names easily).
I asked her if she worked there often, since I haven't seen her there before.
She told me she actually was the manager of that gym, but since I often work out at 22.00~02.00 (10 PM -&gt; 02 AM) I don't often see people working there. Staff is only there between 16-19 (4-7 pm) 4 days a week.
I should have negged her in a funny way ""wow, do I get the pleasure of talking to the big manager"".

She said she was 22. I asked her how old she thought I was. Good work me! It made the conversation sooo much more smooth and funny. She guessed 25 and I played a little with her ""a liiiittle lower"". When I told her my age she said: ""Wow you are not old!"".

Sorry if this is incoherent, I can't really recall the whole conversation. But I felt we had good energy and I asked her if she wanted to go take a coffee sometime. She was smiling and somewhat blushing. She didn't say anything. I responded playfully with ""hmmmm, okay let's think of excuses why you can't. You have a boyfriend aaaaand unfortunately you are super busy!"". Boom, was super efficient, she thought it was funny and replied with ""I actually do have a boyfriend.."". (Might have been a shit test). My response was ""you know pretty girls are allowed to have two ;)"". ""Ohhh haha, in what bible does it say that?"". ""Haven't you read the universal book of rules?"". 

The interaction ends with her asking what my name was again and says ""Let's do it.. maybe. I will look you up in the system ;)"". I noticed she was interested. I laughed and called her out on checking my personal info. I went to take a swim with my friends but I noticed she messaged me on facebook (nooo! # &lt; fb) almost instantly. Haven't read it. Quite interesting as she only had my first name, looked me up in her computer system and found me on FB (I have a quite common name).

Reading through my own post gives me the impression that I was quite needy, but I wasn't. 10-15 seconds into the conversation I was super confident and talking like I was the boss.

**Things I'm proud of:**

* Doing an approach.

* Doing a cold approach. Damn even if I was going to be rejected, I'd be super proud.

* I looked deeply into her brown eyes during the whole conversation (It gave me so much power in the interaction. Try it. It's crazy.)

* I was talking slowly and confident

**Things I should have done better:**

* When I was walking away I should have taken her number!

TLDR: Overcame AA for the first time in my life during day game. She had a bf but she looked me up and contacted me on facebook.

----

**Update:**

I'm beginning to thinik I'm being played with. Not sure I'm just being paranoid.

She read my message the same night as I sent it, but she hasn't answered it yet.
The thing is that I was contacted by a girl who had previously seduced me (like 6 months ago), the day after my interaction. We haven't really talked since, but we have seen eachother a time or two in the local supermarket.
The creepy thing is that she is the only mutual friend with HB8 on facebook and she's being super on. On the other side, HB8 seems to be a type of person who has a million friends. My first thought was that her friend asked the seductress if she would test me out or something. I don't know. Perhaps it's just a coincidence.

Oh and by the way, HB8 is single according to facebook, hence it was a shit test. I'm going to go work out in 3-4 hours or so, perhaps she'll work there and I'll try to seduce her.

My question to you is: If she's not there, should I contact her in any other way or should I just let it go? Right now our conversation is at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1iw5y9/fr_holy_shit_my_first_cold_approach/cb8wp0o).

**Update 2**

Was there, saw her, negged here a little on the terribly obvious boyfriend lie. But it felt she kind of used it to say ""I'm not interested"" or it could be because she already said it, she wanted to hold on to it because of embaressness, much like a child is never wrong (""I totally wanted this read this magazine. I totally didn't want the toy that came with it!"") . 

Said good bye when I left casually, she responded casually. Pretty much it. Better luck next time!

OK, you've made it this far. You are with a beautiful woman whose company you truly enjoy. You desire her. She longs to be desired. It's time to harness all that passion.

Obviously everyone's beliefs and situations are different, but I am writing this section with sex as the goal. Adjust appropriately if you are more interested in slowing things down. Just keep in mind that it's MUCH easier to enter into a fruitful relationship with a woman AFTER you've made her cum a half-dozen times. And that's true whether you're looking for a wife, girlfriend, friend-with-benefits, or anything in between.

I'm going to describe three different men to you. Think long and hard about your experience so far and be honest with yourself. Are you falling into any of these traps? If so, pay extra attention to and work hard to fix your problems.

**Man #1: The Dancing Monkey**

The Dancing Monkey works hard to entertain his date. His frame of mind is, *""I really hope she likes me.""* He uses humor as a shield to keep his date entertained and avoid the risk of rejection. He goes for the kiss at the end of the night and, more often than not, is rebuffed. He has had the *""Let's just be friends""* conversation more times than he's proud of.

**Man #2: The Non-sexual Nice Guy**

The Non-sexual Nice Guy is, by all accounts, a friendly person. He tries to be kind. He hopes that, by being nice and cordial, he will win the girl. He holds doors, doesn't complain much, and gets lots of compliments from women. He shirks away from public displays of affection. He's deathly afraid to offend others. He ""likes"" girls' Facebook comments often. He too, goes for the kiss at the end of the night, and more often than not, is rebuffed. He has had the *""Let's just be friends""* conversation more times than he's proud of.

**Man #3: [The Modern Alpha Male](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/)**

He's not ""alpha"" in the fist-pumping, type-A, bro-type sense. Nor is he ""alpha"" for picking fights and putting down others. Yet, Women find him irresistible. He has no problem attracting and keeping women. His life is abundant. He has sex often.

In more cases than not, the only difference in the development of these three men is that man #3 learned to *physically escalate* from a younger age. Because he embraced his sexual side early, he naturally learned how to be successful with women. He benefited from the confidence and abundance mentality this gave him. Everything else auto-corrected.

Learning and practicing physical escalation with women is one of the final keys in your development. **Master this one skill and you will be that much closer to becoming the man you want to be.**

---

**Physical Escalation**

This scenario happens all the time. A man is on a date with a woman. The man fails to touch the girl and only goes in for the kiss at the end of the night. He goes home alone. His internal dialogue says, *""WTF why won't girls hook up with me? I guess I'm in the friend-zone again.""*

Meanwhile, the woman goes home, confused, wondering if the guy likes her. Her internal dialogue says, *""I thought that was a date. I guess he just wants to be friends?""*

ALWAYS BE ESCALATING! That entire miscommunication could have been avoided if the man had just escalated physically. Don't fall into that trap!

All the greatest seducers in history could not keep their hands off of women. They aggressively escalated physically with every woman they were flirting with. They began touching them immediately, kept great body language and eye contact, and were shameless in their physicality. Even when a girl rejects your advances, she KNOWS that you desire her. That's hot. It arouses her physically and psychologically.

---

**Leading with your body**

The concept of ""waiting for signs"" or ""Indicators of Interest"" was commonplace in older pickup theory. It is 100% garbage and needs to be erased from the face of the planet.

Never, ever, ever, wait for a SIGN before you escalate! You will miss out on the vast majority of chances if you sit around waiting for SIGNS. **Men are notoriously bad at reading women's minds and body language. Don't think that you're any different.** From now on you must ASSUME that she is attracted to you and wants to be ravished. It's a difference in mindset that makes champs champs and chumps chumps.

As stated back in the section on Flirting in [Part 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1di9xu/above_the_game_part_5_flirting_touch_conversation/), leading with your body is a very effective form of flirting. It is YOUR JOB, as the man, to lead the interaction. Be playful. Spin her around. Pick her up. Push her away as a tease and then pull her back in. 

Decide that you're going to sit in a position where you can rub her leg and back. Physically pick her up and sit her on your lap. **Don't ask for permission. Be dominant. Force her to rebuff your advances.**

If you adopt this mindset, you will create opportunities where ""going in for the kiss"" just feels natural. You'll have her in close, emotions will be charged, and you'll know. Then it's just a matter of manning up and going for the kiss. Even if she rejects your initial advance, you'll have raised your chance of success in the future. 

---
**IMPORTANT NOTE ON RESISTANCE:**

If at any point a girl wants you to stop, she will let you know. If she says ""STOP,"" or ""GET AWAY FROM ME,"" or shoves you away, you know she is not interested. It happens. Stop escalating immediately and say this line:

**""No problem. I don't want you to do anything you aren't comfortable with.""**

Memorize that line. It is your go-to when faced with resistance. Say it genuinely, without presumption. All master seducers are also masters at making women feel comfortable. You'll be no different. **If a woman isn't comfortable, take a break and try again later.**

All that matters is that you continue to try to escalate physically until she makes it genuinely clear that it's not happening. She wants to be desired, but the circumstances need to be right. With some experience, you will learn to differentiate the *""No, we can't... my parents are in the next room... OMG FUCK ME FUCK ME HARD""* from the *""SERIOUSLY GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME, YOU CREEP""* variety of resistance.

Of course if you're really unclear, back off. Better safe than sorry.

Stop being afraid to offend. You will go through a period of adjustment as you gain experience, just as *a natural* did when he was an adolescent. Just because he had a head-start on you doesn't mean you can't catch up!

Now that you have made your intentions abundantly clear to the girl with your body language, touch, and words, you will find yourself in situations where women are very receptive to your advances. Now is the time to ramp up the physical escalation. Hopefully you've [managed your logistics](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1dtb8m/above_the_game_part_6_logistics_getting_the/) and can get her into a private, intimate setting for what follows...

**Kissing**

Be bold when you go for kisses. Try early and often. It's important. Equally important is being a good kisser. Women are substantially more likely to date &amp; sleep with men who are *GOOD KISSERS.*

One common mistake men make is waiting until the end of the night to go for the kiss. Doing this raises the awkward quotient substantially until it's a build up to *""this big thing.""* That can scare women off. It's much more effective to sneak a kiss in during the date, at the first opportune moment. It diffuses the awkwardness of sexual tension. Grab her and kiss her. Sneak it in when she least expects it.

Likewise, when you get a girl home. I highly advise to go for the makeout as soon as possible (In the back of the cab, in the elevator, as you're opening your front door, etc.) This sets a sexual tone and diffuses awkwardness that can lead to additional resistance.

The secret to good kissing is using your body and not just your tongue. Don't slobber all over her like a dog, but don't peck her lips over and over either. As with everything, it's a balance. While you're doing this, grab her by the hips and pull her into you. Press your groin right into hers. Make her feel your erection. Trust me, this turns women on incredibly.

Softly bite her lower lip. Go Dracula on her neck and kiss it all over. Kiss her collarbone. Softly kiss her ears.

---

**Fondling**

Let your hands roam free. Squeeze her ass. Rub the side of her breasts. Rub your hands up and down her legs. Make her push your hand away as you get closer to her vagina. **Fucking ravish her.**

Grab her hair on the back of her head, by the base of her neck, and pull it back aggressively. Pause and stare her in the eye before going back in.

After a few minutes, go under her shirt and unsnap her bra. Massage her breasts. Pull her shirt off and suck her nipples. Kiss her breasts all over. Let them melt in your mouth and hands.

Unbutton her pants, or pull her skirt down. Feel her pussy. Softly caress it. Lick your finger and rub between the lips. It should be sopping wet by now.

Gently graze her clitoris. (Note: Spend some time researching the female anatomy if you lack sexual experience. You need to know where everything is located, trust me.)

Insert a finger into her vagina. Then two. (Two is the magic number, unless she's very petite or very large.) Do a ""come hither"" motion where you are rubbing the G-spot. She will let you know when you're doing it right through her body movements and moans.

Spend some time fingering her. Don't be shy. A very large percentage of women can achieve orgasm from this sort of stimulation. Your chances of repeat performances goes up tremendously with each orgasm.

---

**Sounds**

Grunt, moan, tell her how *fucking hot* she is. Tell her you love her tits. Tell her how *fucking hot* her pussy is. This is not the time to be shy!

---

**Sex**

Pull out your cock and put her hand on it. *Remember, she is letting you do this because you have established yourself as a LEADER. Don't ask for permission, GRAB HER HAND, and put it right on your dick.*

Tell her to suck your dick. Be dominant. Tell her how *fucking hot* she looks with your dick in her mouth.

Reciprocate and go down on her. Softly finger her while you flick her clitoris with your tongue. Enjoy all of her body movements. Really soak in the passion; this is as good as it gets!

**Be passionate! Passionate sex equals good sex! This is NOT the time to be shy.**

Slip on a condom and fuck her like a champion. Pull her hair, slap her ass, move her around. Fuck her from the back, let her ride you. Experiment with each other! Ask her what her favorite positions are. Touch her everywhere, including her arms, legs, throat, face, and breasts. Make her cum with the force of the hammer of Thor. **Rock her fucking world.**

There is no substitute for sexual experience. Anyone can become a sexual master with a little bit of research, applied effort, and healthy experimentation. Learn what YOU enjoy and seek it out in a partner. Genuinely love the act of giving sexual pleasure to another human being. It's a gift. Embrace it.

---

**Action Items**

1) Go to your local bookstore and walk through the ""Sex and Relationships"" section. Pick up a handful of books that look interesting to you. Spend an afternoon thumbing through sex books to get an idea of what good sex is all about. Read 50 Shades of Grey or some other chick-porn.

2) Practice being physical with women. Lots of women. You know how to approach and seduce. Apply everything you've learned until you feel comfortable being physical with women. If you have serious sexual hangups, seek out a counselor or support group. There is no substitute for experience with this. This is a lifelong journey, so get used to it.

If you're getting her number we're going to assume you've already approached and struck up conversation.

My favorites:

1. After you've been talking a little bit, tell her you want to draw her a picture. This can be on your hand, your arm, a napkin, whatever. Draw the following:

_ _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ _

At the top write ""You fill in the rest"". Guys, this has gotten me so many numbers recently just because it's creative and it makes her laugh. Use this, by all means, use this fucking technique! It is my go to now and I haven't had a girl say no yet.

2. Just flat out approach her and ask her for it. (ex: ""You're really gorgeous and I was just wondering if I could get your number?"") Maintaining eye contact is key! If she looks away, **DONT** lose the eye contact. Stand firm, stay confident and just put her on the spot. Everyone wants to say this is dumb, crazy, doesn't work, or whatever. We'll they're wrong. I have used it and gotten numbers. No plan is 100% guaranteed, but you'd be surprised at how high of a success rate this has. 

3. Approach a girl, give her your number and say ""The rest is up to you"" and smile. This one is more risky/ballsy. You don't want to come off as a jerk/douche. I have yet to try it but I plan to sometime this weekend to see how it works. What's the worst that can happen though? She throws it away? Okay, sweet, you're back where you were before you handed her the number and it only took you 5 seconds to write it down in the first place.

4. After about 5 to 10 minutes of conversation, tell her you enjoyed talking to her and say you'd like to talk to more and ask for her number. This one is really basic, but it works. You should be able to tell if a girl is interested in you within a short span of time. Look for IOIs, read her body language, are you making her laugh?, etc. 

My favorite one is the first one. It has seriously been my go to for every number I get now. Girls find it comical and it's unique.

If you get rejected, who cares? At least you tried and that's what matters.


If you guys have any other good ones, comment them for others (and myself). Good luck, guys!

This is why I come to seddit, you guys give advice that makes much more sense. I posted this in /relationship_help and one guy called me out for taking advice from ""imbecilic neckbeards"". Hey, imbecilic neckbeards are pretty cool if you ask me ;)**

Number one rule: I love you all. You are the reason I am even in this situation so props to you guys. I want to share an experience that I had and I want you guys to take a lesson from it. This is more for the loner's who have never had a girlfriend or are out of touch with their feelings like I am. 

It started as me wanting to get laid. I came on seddit. I approached girls. I met this one girl at a bus stop last year, got her number, hung out a few times, and had sex. As I got to know her more, I started to like her. I was so obsessed with seddit that I thought relationships were for morons, and I ignored my typical oneitis feelings. 

We kept meeting up and having sex, and after a while she asked for a relationship. I said I'll think about it/I'm not sure, and this was my answer every time she asked. Everyone told me I was stringing her along and being an asshole, I denied it even though now I realize its true. I was also denying strong feelings of wanting to be with her so I can develop my player skills.

Last weekend, she came over and cried, saying she is unhappy with how I treated her and she doesn't want to have sex anymore and just be friends. Somewhere in the back of my mind, the child version of myself is cringing at what I have become. This girl is everything I've been wanting my whole life. Every time I saw a couple holding hands, I got mad out of jealousy. And here it was staring me in the face, and I denied it. 

I confronted her Saturday night when we were going to a formal for her sorority, and explained how I was a moron, and told her all about my endeavours as a ""player"" and how I was trying to be someone I'm not. I told her I want to let her in my bubble that I've kept people out of forever, and I will wait however long it takes for her to get intimate with me again. 

I don't blame anyone for my actions except for myself. I simply offer a word of caution. Many players here and in mainstream PUA teach you how to sleep with tons of women, but I don't think that is what 95% of guys want. Most just want a nice girlfriend to settle down with, and these players mess with those goals. Terms like ""oneitis"" make getting into a relationship seem like death. I tell you that this is bullshit. Anyone that ever tells me I have oneitis I will bitch slap from now on. I have expereinced feelings I never knew I had this weekend. The problem for me was I was out of touch with my feelings, while still being controlled by them. Don't let this happen. Now I have to try and salvage something that was there from the start, when I never had to. Again, I blame nobody for my actions except myself, as I should have realized this was happening. It seems I have problems with intimacy and realizing what the fuck I'm feeling. I went from 100% emotion to 100% logic, and it worked out HORRIBLY. It seems the correct relationship is emotion controlled by logic. You need both.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1337052618.0,,,True,t3_tml0a,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tml0a/a_word_of_caution/,
1370982783.0,333,self.seduction,1g5am0,My advice for online dating profiles,415,82,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1g5am0/my_advice_for_online_dating_profiles/,"I get a decent response rate on OKCupid and Pof. I've been on more dates than I can count, kiss closed a zillion, f-closed a zillion, and had a few meaningful relationships all from online dating. I left a comment in another thread saying I do alright, and subsequently have been getting PMs asking for advice, so here you go.

**edit:** you can get plenty of advice and profile critiques over at /r/okcupid and /r/pof

My advice for all profiles in general consists of these main points:

The persona that does best (for me) is whimsical and funny with just a sprinkle of seriousness. So try to write with a whimsical and funny voice. It actually might help to get drunk and watch some stand-up comedy before you write your profile to put yourself in a whimsical/funny mood. I'm being completely serious about that. Drinking will make you whimsical, and stand-up comedy will make you a little funnier. 

But, more specifically...

**1) Be as funny as you can,** as often as you can throughout your profile and in the messages you send. Girls love to laugh, and so they love funny guys. If you read 100 girls' profiles, you'll see some variation of the phrase, ""I love to laugh"" or ""I love a good sense of humor"" about 700 times. Humor is like a social aphrodisiac. Be funny as much as you possibly can, but MOST IMPORTANTLY, try not to sound like you're trying too hard. Make an active effort to not try too hard. It's hard to put into words guys who are obviously trying too hard; it's one of those things you can only call out when you see it. But I'm sure you've seen it before. Don't sound like you're trying too hard.

**2) Never describe your qualities. Rather, demonstrate your qualities.** What does that mean? It means don't use adjectives or broad, vague descriptors like, ""I'm funny"" or ""I'm adventurous"" or anything that literally any other guy could say. Those are descriptions, and they are meaningless, because anybody can say them. The alternative is to demonstrate/illustrate/show your sense of humor or your sense of adventure with a funny joke, witty line, or story about something adventurous you did. Don't just say you're funny; BE funny. So instead of, ""I have a good sense of humor,"" you should say something like, ""If George Carlin and Mitch Hedberg had a love child, I would be the result. Minus the whole drug addiction thing from Hedberg."" Or, instead of saying, ""I like adventure,"" you should say something like, ""I went sky diving last month. This year I'm training to climb Mount McKinley."" Or whatever you do that's adventurous. I don't even know if you think you are funny or adventurous. These are just examples. Bottom line is: any guy can describe qualities, but only a handful of guys can paint the picture of those qualities. Girls are going to like the latter guy better every time.

I'm going to give more examples of demonstrations versus descriptions, because it's really important. Say for example you want to describe yourself as ""mirthful and blustery."" One time, I actually read a girl's profile in which she wrote, ""I'm really good at getting out of awkward conversations by saying things like 'OH GOD. HELP ME. THIS IS SO AWFUL. I WISH I WAS DEAD.'"" I thought that was perfect. It SHOWED she's ""mirthful and blustery,"" it SHOWED she's funny, and it SHOWED she can't stand boring conversation--all in one relatively short sentence without describing herself. She didn't say, ""I'm mirthful, blustery, funny, and I hate boring conversations."" She proved those things. You should aim to do the same. Tell a story about when you were mirthful and blustery. Demonstrate, don't describe. Don't write a resume about yourself, paint a picture of yourself.

Chuck Palahniuk has a good essay on how to write with engrossing detail. It's for fiction writers, but the principles apply equally to writing your profile. Read this: http://chuckpalahniuk.net/features/essays/the-devil-in-the-details

I can't stress the importance of that enough. Paint a picture of yourself. Don't describe yourself. This alone will set you apart from 99% of the guys out there. Setting yourself apart is one of the most important factors of success, because she's reading many profiles in one sitting and they all start to blur together before long.

**3) Be concise.** This goes for your profile and your messages, unless you think you're REALLY REALLY REALLY interesting and funny. The reason is, girls are browsing hundreds of profiles and getting anywhere from 10 to 90 messages a day (not an exaggeration). They don't have the time or patience to read a novel length snore-fest from some guy on the internet who they have absolutely no investment in. Therefore, your goal should be to be short, sweet, and to the point--that goes for both profiles and messages. You want to make maximum impact with minimal words. DO NOT get wordy (unless you're awesome and know for a fact you are enthralling with your words). If you've written something, chances are you need to cut it in half, and even then it'll be too long. That's actually an exercise writers do to improve--they write, then they cut it in half. Concision is key.

**4) Don't sound like you're trying too hard or desperate.** This one is hard for me to elaborate on. You kind of just know it when you see it. Phrases like ""I'm looking for true love"" or anything remotely similar are phrases that send up ""I'm trying too hard"" flags. You want to sound casual, as though you're just here to meet cool new people, and if a romance blossoms from that, that's a nice bonus. And remember, you're going for whimsical and funny, so trying-too-hard phrases like ""I want to meet the girl of my dreams"" (unless it's in the context of a hilarious joke) do not fit that whimsical/funny persona.

**5) Be interesting/original.** Like I said, girls are browsing hundreds of profiles. You have to make yourself stand out. That means you can't say something every other guy in the world has already said. So when you write something, ask yourself, ""Has she probably heard this line or a similar one before?"" If yes, delete, rewrite, and repeat. If you're not sure what's too unoriginal, browse profiles for about 40 guys, and you'll start to see the same thing get written ooooover and oooover again. If you browse enough women's profiles, you'll notice the same thing too (I actually comment on this in my profile). But look at guys' profiles so you can see specific examples of what lines, descriptions, and phrases are overused. Then avoid them.

**6) Demonstrate that you're decisive, purposeful, and have passion in life.** Aside from humor, these are the hot-button qualities girls find attractive in guys. ""Decisive"" means you shouldn't be throwing out contradictory phrases, regardless of how true they are, that try to cover a bunch of qualities. For example, a lot of people say something along the lines of, ""I like to go out and have fun, but I also like to stay in and chill."" There are so many problems with that line. 1) It's more boring than watching paint dry. 2) It's unoriginal; everybody says it. 3) It sounds like you're writing for a horoscope. 4) It doesn't actively demonstrate decisiveness, and 5) it demonstrates the opposite of decisiveness. #4 and #5 are really the point of the example. So you want to choose one--""go out"" or ""chill."" You may like a bunch of things. You probably do like to go out and stay in equally as much. But you sound decisive and passionate when you pick the one you like best and state that one. So that phrase should be changed to something more like, ""Life is short, so I'd almost always rather go out and meet new people, ask homeless guys for money, or play match-maker in a retirement home."" (See how I threw some humor in there for good measure? Because if it wasn't clear, GIRLS LOVE FUNNY.) Oh and most importantly...

...

...

...

**7) Leave hooks.** Like the cliffhangers at the end of episodes of LOST (or whatever suspenseful show/movie you're familiar with), and like I did at the end of the last paragraph. The purpose is to spark their interest and make them want to find out more. This means you can't tell them everything, be too specific, or be too much of an open book. I mean, you can be specific and say things about yourself, but every once in a while, you want to be somewhat mysterious to grab their interest. So for example, instead of saying something like, ""I had a great time travelling to Mexico because we met a guy named Pedro who gave us a tour of his hometown, and we almost got trampled to death by a stray bull."" Say something like, ""If you ever go to Mexico, be wary of tours from Pedro, especially if there might be bulls in his neighborhood. Trust me on this one."" That will leave them thinking, ""What the hell happened when he was in Mexico to make him say that? Sounds like an interesting story..."" And then they'll be that much more likely to message you or respond to your messages.

Remember, girls like guys who are ""mysterious."" So you create an aura of mystery by not disclosing too much and by leaving hooks instead. Tell interesting stories, but don't give details about yourself. That way she'll think she knows a lot about you (because your stories paint pictures), yet nothing at all (because you leave out personal details). 

**8) Pictures:** don't take a cell phone picture of yourself in the bathroom mirror. I didn't know guys actually do this. It's fucking ridiculous. Girls agree. 

Only post good pictures of yourself. What's ""good?"" Preferably pictures that have a positive vibe, pictures in which you're smiling, having fun, or where you're in a social setting (around other people and it looks like everybody is having a good time). Girls like guys who have ""social proof."" You demonstrate social proof by showing people having a good time around you. Nobody likes a boring loner. It's okay to post a picture of yourself alone, but only if it makes sense -- like a head shot that you didn't take yourself -- one that was cropped from another picture, or maybe taken professionally. Never post a picture you took of yourself unless it's really really funny or demonstrates a good part of your personality. Girls hate it when guys post self-taken pictures. Seriously. I know I said ""most importantly"" a few times now, but this next one is really probably the most important...

Look at all these hooks! Hooks everywhere! But seriously...

**9) Use proper grammar and spelling.** A lot of women use grammar/spelling to instantly screen out people. They'll immediately click away from profiles that don't use proper spelling and grammar. Girls want guys who are educated and well read. Whether or not your shitty grammar/spelling is symptomatic of idiocy is irrelevant. Enough girls use it as a screen to make it important. It's a simple fix. Don't ruin your odds by being lazy and/or actually stupid. Edit your shit to sound halfway smart.

But fucking read it because i know what I'm talking about. Sorry for the flood of hatorade but people both inside and outside the ""seduction"" community continue to misunderstand this whole thing.

Look, ""seduction"" and ""pickup"" are terms that today's community has unfortunately inherited from a more sleezy time: *cough* Ross Jefferies *cough*. Neither of these terms accurately represent this subreddit or much of the rest of this community. The terms seduction and pickup imply that you are somehow manipulating and even fooling a girl to sleep with you. Today, this is simply not the case, or at least not what ""pickup"" is intended to be used for. Learning pickup nowadays, as long as the learner is a decent human being, is nothing more then gaining understanding of what attracts a woman to a man and then making the necessary improvements in one's life to take on those qualities. 

Is there a particular ethos of the seduction communtiy? Of course there's a fucking ethos: Always seek to improve yourself in all aspects of life and build yourself into a valuable person because this is what allows a man to have the best of both worlds: awesome sex with A LOT of beautiful girls, while both you and every girl you've been with remain happy to have met each other. You know what that is? It's called **AUTHENFUCKINGTICITY**. There's no shortcut to a truly legitimate and satisfying sex life then crafting yourself into an authentic person and projecting your authenticity onto others with no other motive then to leave them better off then before they met you.

If you feel that seduction/pickup has in some way perplexed you or negatively effected you, that is only because you thought there was a quick fix that would ameliorate your frustratingly lacking sex life. That's not seddit's fault, that's your own. People who think this way, which is unfortunately a large portion of the seduction community, can get loads of pussy thinking they need to somehow manipulate girls to fuck them, but I can assure you that this type of approach to pickup will only create problems in your life and will never land you the woman that's so fucking awesome that she's worth spending the rest of your life with.

We're not here to ""trick"" girls into sleeping with us. We're here to improve not only our own lives but the lives of the girls whose pants we're ripping off. Do you guys have any idea how frustrated women are about men these days? Do you have any idea how fucking siked women are to meet a fun, NORMAL guy that knows how to use his cock? For a lot if not most females, such guys are few and far between.

Men are stupid, women are crazy. **Women are crazy BECAUSE men are stupid.** The ""seduction"" community flat out solves this problem. All we need to do to ameliroate the female population's supposed craziness is to: #1 better understand females and #2 Take on authentic qualities that are congruent with what legitimately attracts a woman to you. THAT is what we fucking do here.

TL;DR There are a lot of people that have completely misinterpreted pickup altogether and are thus doomed to a second-rate sex life.

**My Story:**

My childhood was probably very similar to yours. I grew up in a small suburb. I sucked at sports and spent a lot of time playing video games and messing around on my computer. I was introduced to my first girlfriend at 15. Great, right? Too bad I was a supplicating loser with no idea what I was doing. She was the only girl I slept with for the first 20 years of my life.

We went to college together (bad idea) and, because I was the stereotypical *nice guy,* she ended up cheating on me. I was thrown into a six month depression.

After two sexless years of college, I found myself firmly in a rut. I desperately needed a change. I packed my bags and moved to Tokyo for a one-year study abroad.

I had no idea what I was doing there either. After over six months in the country, I could more or less hold a basic conversation but wasn't getting laid. I finally found a girl who would let me put my dick inside her and I developed a hopeless obsession for her. On Valentine's Day I got dressed up and bought champagne, flowers and chocolates. I waited for her to show... She never arrived - she was on a date with a more confident and suave man. I spent Valentine's Day alone crying.

Fast forward a couple months... I got out of my latest rut and decided that enough was enough. I began going out, hitting the bars and clubs, talking to people. I had no idea what I was doing but I was energetic, American, partially fluent in the local language, and drunk. Lo and behold, I started getting laid with ugly chicks out of sheer luck.

Then I returned to the US. I spent my last two years of college sexless once again. I wasn't going out, I had massive approach anxiety. I knew how to escalate physically and have sex, but I didn't know how to MEET women in the first place.

I finally met a girl from the internet and she let me put my dick in her. Since I still had no idea what I was doing, I began dating her exclusively. I spent the next couple years taking her out to nice dinners while she was fucking other guys behind my back. That makes me 3 for 3 for girlfriends cheating and then dumping me. Notice a pattern?

Around this time I picked up a copy of *The Game* at a friend's house. I found it interesting. A few weeks later, I googled the characters from the book and came across Mystery's original posts on usenet. I only really learned one thing, the *Three Second Rule:* You have three seconds from when you see a woman you like to walk up and talk to her. It stopped my Approach Anxiety before it could even kick in.

At that that time I was living in New York City. I fumbled my way through nightclubs, bars, after work happy hours, and parties. I started having sex with a lot of women - and, finally, some of them were even hot!

In 2010 I took a new job and relocated back to Tokyo. I had lost touch with almost my entire college network. I needed to build a social circle from scratch. Since I had lots of time on my hands, I set off to do just that. I searched around the web and came across seddit. I liked what I saw and dove in.

I began consuming material, posting, commenting, reading and most importantly - GOING OUT. I met up with a couple of the local Tokyo-based sedditors. I posted field reports and became an active contributor. Within a few months I was added as a moderator and the rest is history.

Since discovering seddit, I've had the opportunity to game all across the globe. I've built social circles in multiple cities and countries and sarged with many brothers-in-arms I am proud to call friends (shout out to /r/BayAreaSeddit, /r/GothamSeddit and /r/TokyoSeddit!). I've observed masters in action and coached dozens of you guys. I created the local seddit lairs and now we have thriving communities in many cities.

Throughout all of this, I have known that the books, material and links in our sidebar can be confusing and outdated. I knew there had to be a better way. I started collecting all my notes, based on real in-field experience and coaching I've done, distilling the best theory, advice, and methods into one condensed methodology - complete with action items for people to start implementing immediately. These notes form the basis of *Above The Game.*

I haven't done an FR in awhile, but I recently decided to get out of my rut and say ""fuck it"" and went to the bar with my friends.

At the first place we went to, we settled in, and I talked to the first two girls I saw near us. It didn't matter what I said, I'm pretty sure I just asked them some questions and got the jitters out, then they left and we moved on. We ended up playing some beer pong and having a good time for an hour or two, then we decided to move to a different bar. Before we go inside, these two girls walk by slowly while looking at the entrance to the bar, I make a comment about how they obviously want to go inside, and they should come hang out with us. I don't intend for this to go anywhere, she says she is taking her friend home, but maybe she'll come back.

We go inside and look at the drink menu. Within a few minutes the girl who walked by with her friend walks up behind me at the bar, alone.

We talk for a bit, and I escalate kino, naturally, not forced, its important to touch people in a way that doesn't violate them, not just women, its starts with just touching elbows and shoulders when making a comment to putting your arm around her shoulder or touching her knee, it should be natural to you, and if it isn't practice it, touching people is the fastest way to demonstrate sincerity in your interactions.

The conversation goes great, and I kind of mention that we should go hang out back at my apartment. We walk back holding hands and talking.

At this point, I'm not expecting anything (a year ago, I would say I didn't but totally get pissed if I didn't get laid) and I'm just happy to have met someone nice. For the first time I think I was actually outcome independent.

When we got back to my place, we smoked for a bit and talked. This is the first time I've tried this, but I used the ""I'm going to kiss you now"" line when I wanted to kiss her, rather than just going for it, and it was an interesting approach, because she was expecting it and seemed more into it than caught off guard. I just gave her a quick kiss on the lips, hung for a second, and pulled back.

Then, we talked a bit more, and without saying anything, I took off her glasses and started kissing her, this time a bit more passionately, but still not too eager.

Then, I asked her how she felt, and she said she thought she should go home even though it would be fun to hook up. I was completely honest with her and told her that I agree, hooking up would be fun, but I've never formed good relationships by sleeping with someone the night I met them. I walked her to a cab, got her number and said I'd take her out this weekend.

**Important aspects to this FR**

* [True] outcome independence
* Escalate kino naturally
* Talk to people, whether you just need to get in state or just to interact with people in general, people generally want you to talk to them as much as you'd want them to talk to you
* Kill your oneitis, stop talking to your hang-up (this is somewhat related to the FR, I recently cut off contact with a girl I was hung up on that didn't have feelings for me and treated me badly, this was not an easy move for me to make and doing so made me more confident with my decisions).


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** I have not neglected my inner game, I go to the gym several times a week, I'm currently on a paleo-ish diet and losing a bunch of weight, I'm heavily involved in my studies, I go to therapy, I keep my room clean, etc., this is much more important to my success than any technique.",Field Report,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,frflair,,True,t3_1jvg1p,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1jvg1p/fr_kclose_girl_from_street_with_offhand_comment/,

Ideally you want her to have your number too. So right after shes put in her number you can:

A) missed call/put in your info (weak)

B) text her later ""good to meet you"" or whatever

C) text her right then with a relevant quip (very good)

D) Get her to text herself something sexy/flirty/etc while she is still holding your phone.

I just started using the last one last night, and it was awesome! The girl is picking herself up for you and you can learn what shes into and her texting style right off the bat.

Proper tactical mate.


Edit for clarity: 

Once she's put her number in and while she's still holding your phone, playfully suggest that she text something to herself, my line ""Text yourself something that'll work"". I enjoyed this because she basically did all the work for me while I was chatting with my friends.

In game terms, I did a nice little investment ladder,

Take my phone &gt; Put in your number &gt; Put in your name &gt; Text yourself

Challenged her and got her to qualify herself to me

""Something that'll work""

And did some clean logistics (got her number, she got mine, no fuss no muss).

edit 2: I classify this as a beast at a higher level because when you're at a fancy party there's a lot of hotties to close and also a lot of business to discuss every neuron counts (being a player and being socially aware at the same time isn't always easy). With this method, she's putting in the work, freeing up your time and not making it look like you're trying to pick up. In this case we were sitting at a crowded table and she was beside me so I just put my phone on the table in front of her, screen on the dialer hand on her body so there's no confusion. I kept the story going, nobody noticed I just picked up this chick, leaving me free to get some more ;)

1365092639.0,326,self.seduction,1bo2wp,Red Pill/Seduction knowledge implemented,425,99,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1bo2wp/red_pillseduction_knowledge_implemented/,"Disclaimer:  I'm in Asia.  Your results may very in the U.S.

Tonight I played my cards well and implemented some red pill knowledge to excellent effects.  Full on Alpha abundance mode. Here's how it went:  

I had a casual date/hang out with a girl I've seen a few times now. She seems to be into me but things aren't progressing much as she sort of has an ""It's complicated"" long distance relationship going and at this point we are just ""friends"" despite clear indicators of interest (touching,  a kiss, flirting etc).

Well I was hanging out with friend-girl about an hour multitasking watching a movie while doing a little email maintenance periodically. (I know, a bit rude, but it was very casual hang out and I was a bit bored)  

Anyways another girl had messaged me from a dating website about meeting later in the night.  I wasn't too thrilled with where the night was going so I agreed to meet her.   She then mentions she is with her friend, another girl.

My manhamster gets a spinning and I get an idea.   Since new girl isn't down for a meet one on one and is hanging with her friend, why don't I do the same and bring a friend.  Of course my friend is a girl who also seems to have a crush and flirty demeanor.

So rather than tell friend-girl I'm leaving and she needs to go, I ask her if she wants to come with me to meet some friends.  She's down.  I let her know this is a first date meetup and there is potential for romance.  She's interested by this but also I sense a bit of jealousy.   But her intrigue to watch me on a date and be present seems to be greater.  Technically she's a friend but there's almost a bit of a cuckoldress vibe to what goes down.

Anyways as I stroll upstairs to meet new girl and her friend at a restaurant our eyes meet as I ascend the stairs and I get a smile so apparently I'm ok for her.  Then she sees the ""friend"" I brought.  The expression on the two girls faces were priceless.   ""WTF?? Did this guy bring a girl on a date??""

I stroll up relaxed and confident with friend-girl.  ""Hey what's up nice to meet you?"".   They are all at once smiling, shocked, giggling and in awe.  

Girls: ""Ummm..is that your girlfriend?""   

Me: ""No we are just friends"".  

Girls: ""Umm you can't do that!!""

Me: ""Sure I can.  You did.  You brought a friend so I figured I can as well"".

Girls:  ""But ..but...that's rude.  You're like on a date.  What is she supposed to do?"" 

Me:  ""We can all chat.  Besides, if it's rude to bring her it's rude for you to bring your friend also.  It's the same thing.  We both brought a friend. Just relax""


At this point the girls' hamsters seemed to simultaneously have a stroke and my reasoning prevailed.  These girls could barely contain themselves.   Huge grins on their face, some more giggling, a bit of discussion in their native language. Some disbelief ..I'm sure their hamsters where spinning out of control  with ""how can this guy do this?""

Anyways played it cool and calm as shit and engaged the two girls in conversation also bouncing back to the girl I brought.   

Let me tell you these girls were intrigued and turned on. The mood was exciting and filled with a sexual vibe.  And this bumped up my market value to friend-girl I brought also.  After a bit I could feel some jealousy that I wasn't paying enough attention to her.  After I did she started to be affectionate touching my arm at times.

Anyways, what I did here was employ abundance mentality, undeniable social proof, and preselection.  There was a definite chance that I could mess it up with the friend I brought, mess up a date and embarrass myself in front of my dates friend.  But I. Don't. Care.  That shows abundance.  

I was calm and relaxed and brought just enough energy to keep the conversation flowing smoothly.   After an hour I told the girls thanks for meeting me, gave my date a kiss on the cheek, and left with my female friend.

After that I went home.  My female friend is blowing up my phone talking about the night asking if I would date her if she breaks up with her bf.   Asking what I think about the girl I met etc.

Also the girl I met on the date is blowing up my phone now asking about me and what I thought about her friend and setting up another meet.

I didn't look especially great tonight.  I wasn't any more entertaining then normal.  I just simply played my cards well in a way that displayed true abundance mentality and it was effective like clockwork.

If you are not morbidly obese, you're doing pretty good. Do your arms and legs work? You're doing pretty good. Can you look in a mirror without recoiling in horror? You're doing pretty good. Have you ever looked at someone who is really ugly and with an attractive woman and wonder how he got her? He didn't puss out. He knew who he was, and he was comfortable with that. He didn't let thoughts of self-doubt stop him from even attempting to get with a woman. That mother-fucker believed he could get her and didn't quit out of fear of what might happen. Whenever you look at a girl and think she is too pretty for you, remember that people who look way worse than you are getting laid. 

Don't be afraid to try. The other day I saw a girl I liked around campus talking to a man who looked way better than me and figured she was into him. I nearly abandoned my plans of talking to her because of something I assumed. She wasn't actually into that guy, although he did bang her a few weeks ago. Now she can't stand the guy, but she's clearly into me. You know what, now it's my fuckin turn! I almost quit before I started. Don't do this. Do not quit because of an self-doubt. ""What if she doesn't like me?"" ""What if she thinks I'm weird."" ""She'll never want a guy like me."" Here's my question, what if you live your life in fear of what might happen? What if this fear stops you from doing everything you want to do? FUCK FEAR! Life involves a lot of uncomfortable situations, fuckin accept it and power through them.

-----

### Something seddit needs

**There is not enough material on how to be interesting**. Most of what we teach is ""inner-game""/confidence. 

Seddit should be about all self-improvement and seduction. Once you have the balls to talk to somebody you need to have 
something to say. If you want a relationship with a smart girl and not just a one night stand then you need to be interesting. 
Confidence is only half the equation towards demonstrating high value. [This guy is probably confident](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/imagebuzz/web03/2011/7/11/21/peace-be-with-you-brah-18107-1310432507-16.jpg), but you can tell he is going to have nothing to say.

What can you do? Learn some patterns for telling anecdotes, and patterns for jokes, and techniques to spontaneously bounce ideas. Seddit needs some posts on these. I'll do some in the future, anyone else want to join?

----

### Simple tricks for interesting conversation with somebody you already know

1. Ask relevant blue sky, open-ended questions, e.g. when talking about animals try ""I wonder what aliens would look like?""
2. Give them the tl;dr rather than the story, and let them ask you questions about it.
 e.g. ""I humiliated myself yesterday"". ""how?"". ""I fell off my bike while eating an ice cream"". 
""Hah!? why/how/where?"". Then go into detail, one sentence at a time, and hopefully have a useless 
""life-lesson"" at the end.

-----

### Intelligent conversation topics for the lazy:

When bored (or feel like lightly preparing for a dinner party type thing) I get some good topics [from here](http://www.aldaily.com/), then look around wikipedia for a bit on the topics discussed. Its efficient.
Also read slate.com, wired.com, NYT, and the top-posts-of-the-week in /r/truereddit. Sunday newspapers are great too.

### How to tell if your field report is any good: a tongue-in-cheek checklist (tongue-in-cheeklist)

☐ Some people don't believe you    
☐ Some people say it was ""easy, so what?""    
☐ Some people accuse you of rape    
☐ You are told you wrote too much    
☐ You are asked to write more and clarify things    
☐ You get hate-PMs    
☐ You get dismissed as 'you must be attractive'    
☐ But mostly people seem to like it and leave nice comments

### Your Myers-Briggs personality type and how you can use it.

Can be fun to talk about. Also look up the ""big five"" personality types.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_five_personality_traits

Personality type has become a favourite conversation topic of mine, especially with the tenderer gender. Girls love reading 
horoscopes and answering quizzes. Psychology is fun. 

Also it could be a great goal when meeting somebody: find out their type ASAP.

My type is ESTP, what about you guys? How useful do you think this is?

You can learn your main sticking points and how to improve a little easier if you look at the weaknesses of your type.

### A Piracetam call to arms

4 months ago I made a post (http://redd.it/m1ga0) about a nootropic (""smart drug""), Piracetam, for social use. I still take it on occasion. I often skip
it on days when I expect to be a bit antisocial because of work piling up.

I've had several PMs and messages from some people who have had pronounced and positive effects. One such review was:

    I'd simply like to let you know that I'm grateful for your post about piracetam about 4 months ago. 
    Based upon your review of it I decided to try it myself. The supplement/drug
    affects me in a very similar way. I've noticed a great increase in confidence, eye contact, 
    posture and most of all, verbal ability.
    I don't plan on taking it every day, instead from now on I plan to take it when I know I will 
    be in tight social situations. Thanks for posting your experiences with the 
    substance; it sure helped me.
    Thanks.
    
**Did anybody else try piracetam? What were your thoughts?** 

I have had issues with mixing it with too much caffeine (2 cups of coffee or more) - sometimes I have had anxiety (very unpleasant) and other times I become horny and very confident and start hitting on people when I probably shouldn't...

**What is Inner Game?** Inner Game is what goes on in your mind. It's the attitudes, values and emotions you carry with you in every moment of your life. A man with solid Inner Game will have few problems attracting women. He will have strong confidence and self-esteem. He is the man every one of you reading this should strive to be.

I've put a lot of focus and effort into writing and collecting the best references on Inner Game possible. I encourage you to read the posts linked below. Revisit them from time to time and feel free to ask any questions you may have.

Without further ado...

(http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tgw28/why_be_yourself_is_the_worst_advice/)

A response but not a rebuttal. I'd like to talk about the frame set by this point: ""the you isn’t good enough right now.""

1.

The YOU is good enough. It's more than good enough. In fact, the YOU is so good that should you ever come in real contact with it, you'll find the key to eliminating anxiety. You'll have an abundance of opportunity with women. You’ll find yourself living the life you’ve always wanted to live.

Let me explain.

The ""you"" that's not good enough is not YOU. It's a construction of your ego. Through how you were raised, what your parents taught you and what you learned in school/life, you've constructed a ""you"" that is not YOU.

A simple example.

You see a group of girls. Instinctively, your first desire is to approach (even if you're not involved in pickup). It's natural attraction that exists between a man and woman. 

But you don't approach.

*""They'll think I'm creepy.""* 

“You” (the ego) tell yourself (YOU) that.

It happens ALL the time. So often, most people don't know who they are – all they know is their ego. For many, this ego is the “you.” And since most of us listen to our egos, it gets more difficult to sense what we want to do.

The true desires are still there – they’re just hidden by the ego.

60 Years of Challenge has a theory:

Whether you have a good or bad night is determined by **whether you do what you want to do or not.**

You're standing in line at a club. The people next to you are talking and YOU want to join in the conversation. If you join in, you get confidence. If you don't join in, you get anxiety.

If you join in, you're BEING YOURSELF. If you don't join in, you're listening to your ego (“If they wanted to talk to you, they’d say something”).

But what if you say something and they don’t respond? 

It’s like getting rejected by a girl. Yes, it might sting. But you still feel confidence because you did what you wanted to do, even if it didn’t turn out how you’d like it to. 

Experienced PUA’s know a good night doesn’t start until the first rejection.

Now you go up to the bouncer. YOU want to say something to him. If you do, confidence. If you don't, anxiety.

60 says good and bad nights are NOT determined by approaches. They're determined before you walk in the door. They're determined by how often you said “yes” to YOURSELF, or how often you said yes to your “ego self.""

**A good night is when you “were yourself.”**

Important: when most people hear “just be yourself,” they think, “I am being myself – how could I not?” What they don’t realize is there are two “selfs”: the ego construction and the real you.

It is possible to not be yourself and think you are. 

When you do what you want (talk to people in line, talk to the bouncer, approach the first girl you see instantly), you build confidence. When you don’t because of the ego, you create anxiety.

You don’t talk to people in line. You may think, “no big deal.” It is. Instead of pushing you towards confidence, you caused anxiety (however small). 

You don’t talk to the bouncer. No big deal; except it is. You enter the club **already in an anxious state.** 

Conversely, if you did everything you wanted to do, you’d enter the club **already in a confident state.** 

This is “state control.” This is “frame management.” The secret is BE YOURSELF –knowing what that means is the hard part.

2.

Why do I say you are good enough? Because you are. 

When you see a girl, YOU want to approach her immediately. When you see people engaging in a conversation, YOU want to make friends with them.

YOU are capable of doing everything you’ve ever wanted to do. So why don’t you? The ego.

Therefore, it’s not about building a better you. It’s about **dissolving the ego construction, allowing you to always BE YOURSELF.**

Sure, having hobbies and being healthy is attractive. But don’t YOU want to do those things already? Don’t you know what you’re passionate about? Don’t you know what type of body you want? 

Why don’t you listen?

Why are you spending the majority of your life not being yourself? Why does 99% of the world spend their entire lives living in the ego construction? Why are we so afraid of being ourselves?

3.

I’ve struggled with social anxiety. I’ve always been in touch with what I’ve wanted to do – I just haven’t done it. I wanted to call that girl up, wanted to talk to a group of people I thought were interesting… but I didn’t.

Saying no brought me anxiety. 

Funnily enough, saying yes to the ego causes anxiety. When you allow the ego to “protect you,” you cause anxiety.

You cannot win when you are your ego construction, so stop playing.

How? Be yourself. Honesty.

The first girl I ever met through cold approach taught me this lesson.

When I hung out with her, I was anxious. Why? Because as we walked down the street, I wanted to hold her hand. I didn’t. When we ate dinner, I wanted to escalate. I didn’t. When we got back to her place, I wanted to fool around. I didn’t bring it up.

The end result? Suffocating anxiety. 

The second I left, I was free as a bird. I beat myself up: “why didn’t I just grab her hand?!”

I’d never felt that kind of anxiety before (blame it on inexperience), so I decided to continue hanging out with her. It was an experiment. It got to the point where she recognized I was feeling anxiety whenever we hung out, which prompted the question, “why do you come over here?”

I decided to be honest. I decided to tell her I felt fucking anxious whenever I was over. I always wanted to do things but never did.

And just like that, the anxiety dissolved. It was gone. 

Anxiety exists in your head. As soon as you bring anxiety into the real world, it disappears.

Because when you’re honest, you’re being yourself. When you’re being yourself, anxiety cannot exist. 

You are good enough. 

You have everything you need. It’s time to start **doing what you want to do.** Say YES to yourself, say NO to your ego. Remember, your ego is not on your side with this issue. If you say yes to your ego, you are rewarded with anxiety.

Just be yourself.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_tqgvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tqgvn/why_be_yourself_is_the_best_advice/,

The few relationships I have had in my 23 years of living, all were a result of the female coming after me. I have been lurking this place for awhile, learning confidence and the basics. I already knew these things, eye contact, smiling, etc...but I just could never get over my AA. Until today...

It was a hot day in North Carolina. I went shopping at a book store last weekend, when I noticed a really cute girl who happened to be working there. I didn't have a natural chance to say anything to her, because the other employee was taking charge as soon as I walked in. I thought no big deal, I will come back another day. So here comes today...I made plans like I was really going to go through with it, and approach her and try to get her number. I have never, EVER approached someone like this out of the blue. I got to the shopping center where the store is, and I was nervous as shit. I walk towards the store, and walk right by. ""Great, just take your time, be confident, no big deal"". I walk into a bookstore and pick up a magazine. My eyes are flying by the words, but nothing is sticking. ""Are you really going to bitch out?"". ""Yes."" ""You are better than that, go fucking do it, you are a man!"". I went to the bathroom and paced. I know, I felt fucking pathetic. I looked into the mirror..""You're a cute guy, with a great personality, and a lot of things going for you, why the hell wouldn't she want to see you?"". This went on for over an hour. At one point I walked out and got in my car. I just sat there in the 100 degree heat. ""Is this problem really going to hold you back all your life?"". Took me 5 minutes, but I got out, slammed the door and was on one mission, as I walked back in. I walked right into the store, was greeted by her. I gave her a smile and started looking around at different crap. She comes over and asks if I need anything. We talk for a bit when she notices my shirt which has a band name on it. As it turns out, she is a big fan of this band. BAM! We start talking about music and stuff and she checks me out. ""Don't pussy out!"" ""But I can just come back another day and ask her"", ""WTF IDIOT, JUST DO IT, YOU'RE THE FUCKING MAN!"" She comes around the desk and hands me the bag. ""Hey, I don't normally do this...but I think you're really cute. Do you wanna grab some coffee or hangout sometime?"" Her response? ""Absolutely"". 

At that moment my heart was about to explode. It was that fucking easy? She seemed genuinely interested. Got her number, got over my fear of all that dumb shit. I really don't want to give the impression I think im some master PUA, but the fact that I was able to even ask her was a huge step. I plan on setting up a date tomorrow hopefully. Should I text her today? 

Seddit, thank you. Without this place I would never of had the confidence to ever do this. I beat the shit out of my fear, manned up, and got shit done. Thank you. To anyone experiencing AA, if I can do this, YOU CAN. The only fucking thing holding you back is yourself. You can't live your life in fear. Trust me, I felt like such a bitch before I went through with it. I knew that if I went home without having asked her, I would be depressed for awhile.

Here's why.,433,107,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/w2c7a/hand_them_your_cell_phone_when_asking_for_a/,"When I ask a women for her number (but you should do this with everybody) I will always hand them over my cell phone. This is great in many ways, allow me to explain. For One, you minimize the chance for rejection because it's more of a demand rather than a question. They can say no if they want but at least you don't give them the option of saying no by asking a yes or no question. Two, If you forgot the girls name she will go ahead and type in your phone for you. You have no idea how many times I forget a persons name and I'm saved because they type it in, phew! Three! You look trustworthy because your handing them something of value and you are trusting them with it. So it's an easy way to build some sense of trust. Usually when then have my phone I will turn away and not keep an eye on them, while still maintaining a conversation if any. Four, it makes things much less awkward, you don't have make them tell you their phone number and have repeat each number as they go along, that's just awkward in my opinion. And Five, if you have a flashy phone then extra points are won!

Edit: A couple sedditors have given a couple other good reasons why this is good. Six, If you have an interesting background such as a band, a landscape,  a sports team etc. it could potentially lead to a conversation if she happens to have the same interests, you never know. Seven, and this one is crucial, you always text immediately right in front of her and say ""I'll text you something so you can have my number"" this way you can verify the validity of the phone number and at the same time send a short witty response with your name. Always try and relate that witty text to something related to what you spoke about.

Also, someone said ""well what if some other girl texts me as she's putting the number on my phone?'  Nothing wrong with that! In fact it's a good thing because she will see that other women are interested in talking to you and hence give you some sort of social acceptance. Women want to know that you are accepted by other women. It gives them a sense of security and they feel more comfortable knowing that other women feel comfortable around you. One girl on the thread said it would ""instill some healthy competition"".

If you stare at how someone behaves from across the room for more than 30 seconds, I guarantee you that you'll find at least 10 reasons that she's ""into you,"" 10 reasons that she's ""not into you,"" and ""20 million reasons that you're not going to approach right now.""

Just approach.

You know how I find out if a woman is interested in me?

I start talking to her.

If she starts smiling, standing closer, and laughs at my jokes, I begin touching her.

If she touches back, smiles more, and stops paying attention to other people, and lets me escalate, I keep going. 

It's like I'm playing limbo. Every time I pass one mark, I move on to the next challenge. I don't stop until I fail* EDIT - a girl declining escalation is not ""failure"" in a grand sense. You DO stop and move on, but don't think of yourself as a failure. Don't get all rapey on me, fellas.

But that all starts small with an approach, and a ""hello,"" and that doesn't require IOIs, ABCs, 123s, or any other acronym that you're trying to pull out of your ass because you don't have the balls to approach.

**Never look for a green light to start a conversation - you won't find one.** And even if you do, you need to approach. You don't need permission to walk up to someone in a bar/club/sauna/international space station and start a conversation.

This isn't ""National Geographic Presents: The Woman."" You're not here to analyze what it means when a girl is ""tapping her toes"" or ""pouting her lips.""

Are you interacting with her? No? Then your observations don't mean sh*t.

Honestly, if you're using IOIs as an excuse to approach, you're doing it wrong. **Take a risk - specifically the risk that she's not into you and doesn't want to talk to you - man up, and talk to her. That's the only way you can get anything started, with anyone.**

EDIT

Yeah, I get that you have AA. Yeah, I get that you're scared. I've been there, too. Think I came out this way?

Everything in my life I've ever been good at (except math), I sucked ASS at when I first started. I'm talking bottom 25%, in dancing, in writing, in everything.

I was the prime example of someone who was hopeless, unless it involved video games, or math.

The difference is, I was taught early on that it doesn't matter how you're doing today - it matters WHAT you do today and how that affects you TOMORROW. And that's your life, every day.

So, are you gonna not approach a girl because you have a whole list of reasons (like lack of IOIs) not to approach her?

Or are you gonna throw away your reasons, and just do it?

When you want to get good at something, you have to do more than you think you're capable of. Every. Single. Day.

Common issue: You've spied a hot girl and you want to start rapport. Forget the corny standby: ""Hi, I'm (your name here). I couldn't help but notice you from across the (insert setting here).""

Scrap that noise. Also, asking for a name in the first two sentences of dialogue is lame; don't do that, either.

In fact, don't go running up to her with hustle *at all.*

Find yourself somewhere in her vicinity and ask her (very casually) if she knows what time this place closes. You really don't give two shits and you might actually *know*, but that's not the point. 

What you're after is body language. 

If she's into you, she'll turn her body toward you fully (bonus: eyes that zero in on yours  and/or a subtle smile she can't seem to help) and give you more than the info you asked. (Ex: ""I'm not sure, but I think it's around 2. This is my second time here, so ... "")

**Listen for more cues to keep the conversation going.** This is the mission.

Turn away (obviously) if she's curt and  won't look at you for longer than necessary. No harm, no foul, nothin' to see here, folks.

That ""when's this place close?"" question can be anything, really ... but asking the time is too obvious.

The easiest way I have found is, after I get the ladies name, ALWAYS tell them you are bad at names. Make that point very clear, even if you are not. The next step is to REMEMBER their name. It is really that simple. If the first fact that they know about you is that your name is ________ and that you are bad at names then that is the whole key. Learn and has them invest in you as much as you want during the rest of the night. But, if you impart this fact to them and meet them again at any other party or event, sober or not, it WILL impress them and make it seem like you have invested in them too even if you don't remember anything else about that night, it is a huge jumping off point for any more conversation.

I saw this link on /r/OneY and it was interesting to see how some women feel about the dating game. Even though women have the initial power in their 20's (basically their prime), being an alpha male or having alpha male qualities is extremely desirable in this day and age. I felt that it was related to what seddit promotes (from the male perspective), however, take from a women's perspective and thought it would be good to share.

*/r/Seduction is by far the best seduction community I've found online. Still, I'm constantly amazed by how many people use the excuse ""looks matter,"" even on this subreddit. This is not an excuse that can justify inaction, here's why.*

2.

What is attraction?

Attraction is a wavelength. A vibe. Attraction happens before thought. You see a girl, you feel attraction, you think, “she is attractive.” In that order.

This is what attraction is – that specific wavelength. It’s not the length of hair, color of eyes, types of clothing worn… it’s the wavelength being broadcasted. After the wavelength is felt, attraction may be justified by the mind (“I like her because she wears skinny jeans, high heels and a leather jacket”).

We humans focus too much on our thoughts about something, **not about what that something actually is.** 

We’re focused on our justifications for feeling attraction, not what the attraction actually is.

This is why so many people think looks are everything in seduction. Because they don’t know how to manage their wavelength. They think, “I like this girl because of X,” or “girls like this guy because of X,” then they say they aren’t attractive because they don’t have X.

How are wavelengths defined? Beliefs.

First, realize this: you project everything. You hide nothing. You may think you can hide things since people aren’t picking up on them. But that’s simply because they aren’t tuning into the wavelength you’re broadcasting, not that you aren’t broadcasting anything.

If I showed you a video of a political debate and said, “the president is about to tell a lie,” you could see it in how they spoke. Even if the audience listening in the video couldn’t tell it was a lie, you could because you were tuned into that signal. As a result, you got what was broadcasted – a lie.

So what are your beliefs on attraction? Do you believe you need to be a football star to be attractive? Then that is what your signal projects.

If your life is out of line with your definition of attractive, you will not be broadcasting an attractive signal. You will be broadcasting a signal that says, “I’m unattractive because I’m not a football star, which is what attractive people are.”

Then girls will never view you as attractive, because you don’t match up with your own definition of attraction.

The problem is, when this happens, people go externally. They think, “oh, girls just don’t find me attractive.” **But it’s not the girl!** How is a girl supposed to pick up on a signal you aren’t broadcasting?

Don’t blame your unattractiveness on external events, look inside. How do you define being attractive? **If you aren’t your definition, you won’t be attractive.**

Back to the football example. You weren’t a football star but realized you needed to be one to get girls. So you work your ass off and eventually become a football star.

Now you’re aligned with your definition – you are, according to yourself, attractive. You begin projecting that signal into the world. 

Suddenly girls are noticing you. You walked through the mall and all eyes were on you. A girl even walked up to you, blushed, and handed you her phone number before running away.

You must’ve been right! People are only attracted to football stars!

No.

You have simply aligned your life with your definition of attraction. Now that you are someone you define as “attractive,” you can begin to display that signal. And people will begin to pick up on it.

Can you see how this confuses people? Since our beliefs are what define attraction, we often prove ourselves “right” by living up to them.

For the football player, he may think he is right, that only people who play football are attractive. “See, I told you football players were attractive!” 

Well he is right, **but only because he says so – not because he plays football.**

He then tells his friends, “girls never liked me until I played football,” causing his friends to redefine their own definition of “attractive.”

Here are a list of traits commonly defined as “attractive”:

• People who dress well are attractive.

• People who are thin are attractive.

• Men with big muscles get all the girls.

• Guys who can cook are sexy.

• Men who are interesting are a woman’s biggest turn on.

What is your definition of attractive? Do you fit in the mold of your definition? If not, how can you expect women to find you attractive?

And yes, this means you can become attractive right now. Instantly. This very second.

How?

Simply change your definition of attractive to what you are currently.

“Does this mean I can be 500 pounds, have terrible acne, never shower and still be attractive?”

Yes.

But only if you believe it. If you fully believe attraction is defined by being 500 pounds, having acne and never showering, you will broadcast the “attractive” signal once you reach that point (or immediately if you’re already there).

But this will be very, very difficult to believe. In society, we’ve repeatedly heard only thin people who smell good and have clear skin are attractive. So in order to fully believe you could be the opposite and still be attractive, **you would need to utterly destroy all your beliefs and rebuild them from the ground up.**

Therefore, broadcasting the “attractive” signal is not something most people can do instantly, even though it’s entirely possible.

How can you start? First look at your definition of yourself. Then look for evidence which supports a potential you being attractive. Then change your lifestyle to align yourself with your new definition of attractive.

I’m skinny. Gaining weight and muscle has always been difficult, so it took me a long time to even give it a shot.

I firmly believed attraction meant having muscles and definition. As a result, whenever I wore a t-shirt, I didn’t feel attractive. I felt skinny and insignificant. This was the signal I broadcasted.

At this time, I found evidence that people who were “slender” or “athletic” were very attractive. I saw pictures of movie stars and rockstars who were slender and got laid all the time.

So I started working out. Slowly I gained definition. No, I wasn’t a bodybuilder. But for the first time, I could be considered “athletic.”

My definition of attraction: thin people who are well dressed, cocky, funny and athletic.

Through working out, I was able to become that person. **Once I met my definition, I started broadcasting the signal of “attractive.”** 

I liked wearing t-shirts. I would go out in public and notice girls staring at me. I thought, “damn I was right, it’s all about muscle definition.”

But it wasn’t – it was about meeting my own definition of “attractive.”

Months later, I stopped working out. I lost everything I had gained, but one thing – I still believed I was attractive, so I was, even though what originally made me feel I was attractive was gone.

This is what you can do. Figure out who you are. If you are overweight and your definition of attractive is slender, you will not be broadcasting an attractive signal. You have two options:

1) Meet your current definition (aka, lose weight and start working out)

2) Change your current definition (look for evidence of overweight people who get a lot of girls, notice what they do and why that is attractive, change your definition)

Do either of these and you will become attractive.

Welcome to life outside the matrix.

––

3.

NOTES:

• *This also explains how people can “fall out” of being attractive. “I was attractive in high school, but now girls won’t give me the time of day.*”

*It’s because the person’s definition of what is attractive changed.*

• *Notice how opposites can be equally as attractive. For me, I defined attractive as thin and slender. Someone else could define it as well built and very muscular. Both definitions would be correct and would lead to very similar results.*

• *Yes, this concept opens a very large door indeed. If attraction is all internal, what else is? Hint: everything.*",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1348695404.0,,,True,t3_yhna6,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yhna6/why_looks_dont_matter/,

Last weekend I was in a bar for about 3-4 hours when all three of the Simple Pickup guys were sarging. And last night I got to observe Tyler Durden in field for about 90 minutes. I know a lot of you guys are curious/suspicious about how these guys are in field, so I'm here to clear it up for you all.

First off, all of these guys are legit PUAs. However there was quite a huge skill gap between Simple Pickup and Tyler Durden.

---

**Simple Pickup**

I was out with a couple of my /r/BayAreaSeddit brothers when we ran into all three Simple Pickup guys working game in a bar. These guys run direct game. They seem to be picky with their targets (looking for the hotter girls in the bar), so it's not just spray and pray. Their MO seems to be to isolate quickly then go for deep rapport building. They didn't seem particularly state-dependent.

I did notice a couple of glaring flaws. One was that they would stay in set way too long just to get rejected when they went for make outs. It seemed like they were letting the night pass them by in exchange for a chance at physical escalation with a hottie later on. I don't know about you guys, but if I'm visiting another city and am out on the town, I'm trying to maximize my fun. I was disappointed to see them lock in and not socialize more. There were plenty of cool people in the bar worth talking to.

My guess is it comes from inexperience. Knowing when to eject to maximize your lulz/possibilities is a skill that improves over time.

The other thing I noticed was a certain level of self-doubt. I went to say hi to one of them after he was rejected and out of set (I'm not a fan of cockblocking). He immediately began to utilize run-of-the-mill AMOG destroyers. My first thought was, ""Whoa, dude. You're not even with a girl right now, don't be so quick to dismiss.""

It just didn't feel congruent with the qualities you'd expect from a true mPUA - self-validation and value giving. I expect the self-doubt stems from the cult they've created around themselves. They have a lot of expectations to live up to and they haven't quite arrived yet. I can sympathize with it. I'm sure Tyler Durden was the same way back during the writing of The Game. 

Needless to say, I wasn't all that impressed. They make fun videos, but I would not recommend them for boot camps. They haven't reached true mastery yet. Give them a couple years.

---

**Tyler Durden (RSD)**

heckz, Jewiger, other BAS and non-BAS guys came out for a fun night. We were rolling DEEP with dudes. Always fun :)

So we're opening sets left and right, going for lulz and quick makeouts. I ended up #-closing a girl I am now referring to as nastybutdowntoplow.jpg

It turns out Jewiger k-closed and bounced a girl that blew Tyler Durden out earlier in the night, so that's pretty cool. Can't wait to see that FR!

Anyway... I'm by the bar talking to a couple of the guys when I look and spot a wild Tyler Durden. I instantly stop what I'm doing and go into observation mode. Here is what I saw...

This might sound a little fanboyish, but Tyler Durden is the real deal. I was extremely impressed with his skill level. The gap between his decade+ experience and the newcomers Simple Pickup was clear as day. Also he did not drink a drop of alcohol.

Just like me, Tyler Durden admits to being very state-dependent. His method to get in state was pretty obvious: open every chick that walks by. I mean, complete and total non-discriminatory opens.

His body language and the way he would physically open girls was flawless. Lots of ""the claw,"" or opening girls by instantly dipping or twirling them. He was unafraid to go for instant makeouts. Literally open by going in for a kiss.

He would do this move where he would just point at a girl with one arm and she would stop dead in her tracks. He'd then pull her in and escalate physically right away.

He would open girls this way even if they were in mixed sets, with friends, or even on a date with their boyfriend. 100% pure DGAF mode. Guys wouldn't even try and AMOG him because his alphaness was so apparent.

He would make gratuitous use of the ""Reality Destroyer"" openers that I used to use so much in Tokyo. Basically do things so alpha/random/awesome that girls' brains short circuit and enter pure attraction mode. It was a site to behold.

After that he would hold girls in very close and whisper into their ear. When he talks about generating attraction quickly, the man means it.

You could also tell the guy is totally congruent with being outcomes-independent. Blowouts didn't phase him at all. I loved how he would open the unattractive girls and give them a brief moment of bliss before spinning them off and letting them continue on their way to the dance floor. It was giving value, generating social energy, and just a beautiful thing to behold. At one point the bouncer came over just to make sure he wasn't psycho or something. I am sure it's very rare to see someone open so unabashedly as he did. And even that didn't faze TD.

Eventually he isolated one of the hotter girls and went into rapport-mode. I didn't get to hear what he was saying, but the two of them looked like they were having a very good time. I didn't get to see when he left, so I can't comment on that.

Anyway, he's near flawless. Believe the hype. I would venture to say a bootcamp with him would be very intense but probably worth it. As you guys know, I'm pretty experienced myself and I was able to learn a lot by watching him in field. I describe him as a more aggressive version of myself, or a smoother version of ImKumarYo (our resident approach machine). Tyler Durden is Super Saiyan Level 3.

Anyway, feel free to ask questions. Myself and other BayAreaSedditors can chime in.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_qzr3n,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/qzr3n/my_review_of_the_simple_pickup_guys_and_tyler/,

1364145499.0,321,self.seduction,1ax5y8,Emotions versus Logic: the Biggest Mistake Guys Make with Women,375,54,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1ax5y8/emotions_versus_logic_the_biggest_mistake_guys/,"One of the biggest mistakes guys make, over and over, is trying to logically convince women to date them. They spend an inordinate amount of time demonstrating that they are an appropriate match for her.

For a woman to get involved with you, she must, at some point, take action, even if that means simply responding ‘yes’ to your initiatives. That initiative is *always* based on her feelings. 

The decision to *not* date you may be a logical one or an emotional one. For example, if she’s experienced, she may deduce that her feelings are being manipulated and she may decide that she does not want to date you. Or she may not feel emotionally inclined to date you.

But no matter how logical she is, her taking a positive step to get involved with you will always be based on emotion. You may be the perfect match on paper, but if you don’t turn her on emotionally, she won’t say Yes. Why?

**Ultimately, she knows that feelings are all that remain in a relationship.** No matter how good or appropriate the proposition, if you don’t feel it right at the beginning, you will *never* feel it. She can envision feeling *less*, but she can't envision feeling *more*. If there is no critical mass, it won't happen, no matter how much she logically thinks you may be a good fit for her. 

Her feelings are like riding a horse. If she senses that horse has a broken leg, she knows that continuing to ride it will not heal that leg. If her emotions about you are insufficient, they are unlikely to just develop. Conversely, if her feelings for you are like a bucking bronco, no matter how unruly they are, she can envision those feelings being tamed. This is because that’s always the direction that emotions in relationships move: from unruly to tame. At first, emotions are unruly. Then they become tame.

The biggest shift in thinking for guys improving with women is to start to focus on emotion rather than logically convincing her that you’re a good match for her. Instead of targeting her brain, you target her disposition.

**So how do we focus on emotion with women?**

You must focus on her emotions in two separate stages: the attraction stage and the connection stage.

**The attraction stage comes first.** When you meet, you must come across as a challenge to her. There must be some part of her that wonders whether she can have you or whether she’s good enough to get you. You can do this in a lot of ways. But mostly, in some small way, you are showing her that you are willing to lose her. You are doing small things that indicate to her you are willing to jeopardize the burgeoning ‘relationship.’

* You take risks and act flip

* You joke with her or tease her

* You disagree with her

* You act skeptical of her as a suitor

* You demonstrate that you don’t consider yourself a suitor

If you’ve ever met a woman whom you were genuinely ambivalent about, you probably demonstrated the above ‘naturally.’ 

**The next stage is the connection stage.** Once she’s attracted, you can move on to connection. You do this by getting her to reveal her emotions to you—not her emotions FOR you, just her feelings about things in general.

In order to get her to reveal her emotions, you must first get *personal* with her. Find out personal things. But personal is not the same thing as emotional. “I grew up in Florida,” is not the same thing as “I miss my parents in Florida.” 

In order to get her to reveal her feelings, you first ask her personal questions, “Where are you from? Is your family still there?” and then you ask her emotional questions about those personal facts. “How do you feel about that? Do you miss your family?”

**Going back and forth between attraction and connection**

The attraction stage comes before the connection stage. But you will continue to go back and forth between these two stages. Once you’ve connected a bit, you will go back to attraction. And then back to connection. Once you’ve gotten emotional, you’ll gently pull back and challenge her a bit again. And then once again, you’ll both concede and connect again.

In a sense, the interaction is like an emotional roller-coaster ride. It starts off at the top, shallow and fun and challenging. Then goes down and gets really deep and meaningful. Then it comes back up to shallow and fun and challenging. And then back down to meaningful. In this way, you keep her emotions involved.

I don't fully understand why completely but I will explain what happened--maybe it would help.",392,74,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x0xep/so_within_the_last_month_im_not_exactly_sure_how/,"So in the last month I've undergone some major mental and emotional transformations.  My fear of social situations has been reduced significantly and my game has improved because I no longer fear rejection, like at all.  The whole thing has happened so fast that I've kind of been scrambling for answers as to why.  Despite my confusion, I really want to help others on here out though.  So I'll just post some of the changes that happened to me.

It really started when I started reading about Buddhism.  But before you think this is a religious conversion, I will say that the pertinent part of the philosophy was it's praise of proactiveness.  It embraces the ""I am the master of my fate, the captain of my soul."" mentality and just gave me a way of looking at things more clearly.  You don't need Buddhism necessarily as long as you can find those things elsewhere.

But yeah reading about it helped me see practically 100% of the stress I felt was self-imposed.  Girls (all people for me) weren't making me nervous, I was making me nervous.  I also realized that I didn't feel like it was even possible to fail until I set some level of expectation (a craving, if you will) in my head.  Everyone was making me nervous partially because I felt like in my head I had to impress them and consequently felt like I was on stage giving a performance.  When I lowered my expectations to do nothing but enjoy the present moment (wherever it may be) my fear of approach disappeared.  I could have conversations with people and not feel like I was under microscope.  The pressure was gone. :-)

I still had issues with escalation.  Once again I went back to lowering my expectations.  I told myself, ""It's okay if she doesn't kiss you back, dude.  It's not the end of the world, you're having fun anyway!""  Despite saying that, though I still felt nervous going in for a number or a kiss.  But my own personal LMR was alleviated just by telling myself how good it will feel to go after what I want; not to get what I want, but just to go after it.  To feel like a boss and be that guy who just says to himself, ""I'm going to kiss her now.""  Even when you don't get what you want with that mentality, you still feel like you won.  I receive positive reinforcement even when I don't get a number or kiss because I already got something out of it just by trying.

Another thing that happened is I lost about ten pounds by not drinking soda.  I do look thinner in my face, but I'm a skinny guy to begin with so I don't think losing 10 pounds helped me any (if anything it made me look even thinner when I was already thinner than most).  But I do think that even though a lot of girls like muscular guys, there are a ton of girls who like thicker dudes and girls who love skinny guys also.  It all seems to even out IMO.

There it is, everything I can think of that has encouraged this sudden, drastic change (for the better) in me.  I don't know why I'm really feeling the way I do.  I mean the thoughts that went through my head aren't huge epiphanies.  I've thought them before, but this time it seems different.  Maybe this stuff can't be explained and it was just my time to get it.  But I don't think that's the case completely.

Hopefully this helps someone.  I'm obviously not doing this for karma as a self post.  I just want to help.  I know how much better I feel than I did even a month ago, and I wish everyone could feel the same awakening I have.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1343065790.0,,,True,t3_x0xep,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x0xep/so_within_the_last_month_im_not_exactly_sure_how/,

Here I have make out tips that have been working extremely well for me and are fun to do.  I'm not here to teach you how to go in for the kiss/make out (hint:  just go for it!), these are tips for when you are already making out with that special lady. This is probably nothing new to many of you guys with experience making out with girls, but many guys on here don't have that much experience and could benefit from these tips.

Ok...so you're making out with her.  First, use lots of kino to explore her body, not dwelling on one specific body area the whole time.  In the very beginning of the make out session be more conservative with your kinoing and focus on her face and hips rather than the other spots.  The big spots you are paying attention to the most are her butt, hips, stomach, breasts, neck and face/jaw (not necessarily in that order) to keep the kissing fun and dynamic keep moving your hands over different parts and not in a predictable order. 

Occasionally pull her in so that your crotches are touching, and then pull away after a little bit.  When you pull away stop making out for a a couple seconds and pull your head farther away.  After a second or two she will usually open her eyes and look at you expectantly with the puppy dog look.  Smile at her, you can choose to give her a genuine compliment at this time, but you don't need to say anything.  If you do say something, keep your voice soft, low, and slow and then resume making out.

You can also use the push/pull method in your actual kissing.  After you have pulled away and pause go in for a full lip kiss, but don't make out with her.  Pull away again and do this a couple times before going for the full make out again.  Often times she will move herself closer and closer as you are doing this because you are teasing her and turning her on.

Here is my favorite tip, and the real reason I decided to make this post.  This comes directly after you have pulled away and she is looking in your eyes.  Move your lips towards hers very slowly, she will close her eyes and wait for the kiss.  Put your hand on her jaw/face (I'm putting the slash in there because your hands are big enough that they touch both parts...if you have ever kissed anyone you will know what I'm talking about) but then move your hand to the back of her head.  Let the hair around her scalp run through your fingers and just as you are about to make lip to lip contact, grab the hair and pull her head back sharply.  DO NOT yank her hair, or hurt her, but you do want the movement to be quick and assertive.  She will *practically always* (literally 100% of the time for me) let out a small gasp, similar to a sexual moan.  Now her eyes are facing up and her neck is completely exposed to you.  Without missing a beat from the head pull begin kissing and sucking on her neck assertively.  The neck is actually one of the most erogenous zones on the body.  Girls love this, and it turns them on, while simultaneously making you feel like a bad ass for having the balls to be assertive and command the situation.  Plus it feels great to hear her give that little moan.

Good luck guys, ask any questions if I wasn't clear about some stuff.

Escalating has NEVER lead to a negative consequence",404,91,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/153rk8/reading_the_what_hints_flew_over_your_head_thread/,"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/152w0f/female_redditors_due_to_the_popularity_of_the/

This is probably old news to most of you, but Jesus Christ, reading that thread just made me cringe so much. The amount of pussy you can get if you just go for it is insane and I can't believe guys have missed out on so many opportunities when they're SO CLOSE.

When I was younger I stressed a lot about whether I should ""make a move."" The worry was that if she wasn't interested I would look like a fool. Also there was the fear of ""going too far.""

I haven't really kept count but in the last year I've ""made a move"" on probably 40+ women on the first or second date. Every single time the response was positive. Some were totally DTF right then, others would stop me at some point before we actually had sex.

Not a single one of them was disgusted/angry/upset that I tried to have sex with them. Not one of them stopped responding to messages/calls after the date. 

Of the women who did stop me before we had sex, almost every time we had sex on the following date. I can think of only three girls that had enough will power to hold out for 3+ dates lol. Those were actually the most interesting ones to date too, the challenge I suppose.

**So the message here is clearly that you should escalate, every time, without fear of a negative response.**

Now with that said these are all women I've already built good attraction and kino with and spent a few hours together. I doubt you'll get a very good response trying to make out with random strangers, but then again our natural instincts on these things seem to turn out to be wrong most of the time.

**TLDR Stop worrying about what this or that sign means and just make a move**

Edit:
Let me clarify this post a little bit. The term ""escalation"" can mean a number of different things. In the context of this post I am specifically talking about going for the kiss and then progression from there to sex. 

I am NOT talking about kissing someone you just met five minutes ago. I am NOT talking about chasing a girl around trying to grab her hand after she's clearly showed that she's not interested. 

This post is specifically for the situation where you've already built attraction, she's shown interest, you've spent time with her and she is comfortable with you. I'm not going to get into how to do all of that... that's like three books worth of writing.

To the experienced guys here it's a no-brainer that you'll be perfectly fine escalating physically with a woman who is attracted to you and comfortable with you.

**I'm addressing those who have the fear that if they go ""too far"" or move ""too quickly"" that it will turn the woman off. If a woman is into you, she will NOT get turned off by your sexual advances.**

**Let the girl stop you. If she hasn't said no then you should always keep escalating physically. A girl will stop you when you reach the point that she has decided that's as far as she will go - RIGHT NOW. If she stops you from taking off her shirt while you're making out, cool go with it, just make out some more and try again in 5 minutes. She might let you this time. Or she might stop you again. But she's not going to slap you or call the police or start crying because you attempted to escalate physically.**",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1355958713.0,,,True,t3_153rk8,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/153rk8/reading_the_what_hints_flew_over_your_head_thread/,

1337944150.0,317,self.seduction,u4b4m,Nice guys can finish first--a good read for fellow nice guys :-) ,387,70,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/u4b4m/nice_guys_can_finish_firsta_good_read_for_fellow/,"So over the last few weeks or so I've been trying a drastic new approach to my personal interactions in general.  And I'd like to share my story because I really feel like it could help someone else out.  It's a long read, but if you're a typical ""nice guy"""" I think you should really give it a look.

So my whole life I've been a nice guy.  In high school I was the guy all the girls loved as a friend but nothing more.  I always felt misunderstood for my niceness, though, because it gave me as much joy to give as others got receiving.  I was sincerely a ""nice guy,"" but I was also a pushover and fairly weak-willed.

After moving to college I decided that wasn't for me anymore.  I wanted to get laid, so I went to the internet for help.  I found out through PUA sources nice guys finish last, and one of the first things I did is dump one of the core beliefs I had (being honestly nice to everyone) because I was so desperate to get laid.  Well, that didn't really go well at all. For the next few years I actually regressed.  I looked at flirting as pure manipulation and relationships as a power struggle.  The more PUA I read the more dating felt like some mind game/tug-of-war match. It made me hate the game.  Furthermore, I found instead of girls only wanting to be my friend that now they didn't want to be around me at all.  I started growing hateful and misogynistic, feeling like women were all out to lead men on and hurt me.  I also kind of gave up on PUA as something that would work for me.

Then in the last few months, I found seddit.  I was skeptical at first to go back to PUA but started learning about inner game and how it is necessary to start talking to women.  Seeing a therapist helped prime me for the keys to inner game, so after reading it on here it came to me pretty quickly.  After swearing off women until I engaged in some extensive reading and introspective thought, I started finding confidence in who I was.  But I also found I wanted to be a nice guy again.  I shot down the notion of being nice, remembering the ageless saying, but then my counter-intuition took hold.  I thought, ""Inner game taught me it is more important to be genuine than alpha."" So despite what others told me, I decided to go for it, realizing that it may make me go back to the frustrating friend zone.  But this time I promised myself I would at least try to be different.

What I decided is I was going to be the nice guy, but by my rules.  I was going to be nice, but sexual too.  I would give out compliments, sometimes often, but only if they were sincere.  I would do favors for people, sometimes even large favors, but only because I enjoyed doing so.  Furthermore, I wasn't going to be asexual towards these women anymore.  I would give these girls looks that made them realize I was a very sexual creature.  I would talk to them in a tone that gave them no choice but to realize I was a man.  I would initiate physical contact, even to a very high level of intimacy without making a big deal of it.  But most importantly, I did this while being as nice and sweet as I wanted to be.  More than anything, my goal was to make myself and others as happy as possible.

Since doing this my results have been, to put it modestly, impressive.  Girls absolutely LOVE it.  I have made out, hooked up, and just flat out connected with more women in the last month or two than I have in the last year or two before that, if not longer.  Somehow I became a central hub of socializing with people at work, when I've usually considered myself more of a loner.  Girls who I thought I was never their type are suddenly coming up to me putting their hands around me, asking me to hang out with them and stuff.  Even when a girl does like me as just a friend they seem to not be opposed to being sexual with me too.  I've recently even starting seeing one of these girls as a friend with benefits, and to be completely honest I've never had enough game to have one of those before!

I'm not trying to say everyone should do what I did.  But if you are naturally a giver, and you find you get satisfaction and joy out of helping others, then try being nice to girls, too.  The only few things I suggest are:

1.  Be nice to everyone, not just hot girls.

2.  Say no when you want to or when you feel like you may just be getting taken advantage of (some people are users, but with confidence in your intuition you find them and root them out pretty fast)

3.  When complimenting, only do so if you mean it.  Insincerity defeats the purpose, IMO.  But if you feel like a girl has really pretty hair or there's something about her you think makes her cool, don't be afraid to tell her so (you don't have to, but you can if you want).  Just don't feel like you shouldn't say it.

Anyway, that's about it.  I just wanted to tell everyone out there that IMO the phrase ""nice guys finish last,"" is bull.  If you're a nice person then be one, just do it for yourself and you will be satisfied.

In closing, I'm not saying this will work for anyone/everyone else, or if you are getting good results doing something you should change to this.  I just know what works for me, and hopefully this can help someone else out there accept their inner kindness while still maintaining a high level of sexuality.

I've gone out hundreds of nights and gotten numbers or a same night lay. I've also gone out plenty of times and gotten nothing. It sucks, but I don't let myself feel bad about it.

It's just like poker, you reflect on your wins and losses, learn from material created by others, observe, and devise a strategy that wins over time. **You can play perfect poker and lose to a Royal Flush and no one at the table would ever lose respect for you.** As long as you know that you are taking steps to continually improve your chances of success, and are being honest with yourself throughout all your ups and downs, don't beat yourself up over your losses.

**At the same time, if you sit down hoping to be dealt a royal flush, you're going to lose almost every time. Practice and education is essential.**

Poker players go through hundreds of shitty hands waiting for the moment to pounce. They stick to their guns and have confidence in their ability to win when the moment comes.

Likewise, have confidence in your ability to improve. Know that the time you're putting in will be well worth it.

I just ended a 5-year relationship because my WIFE was a cheating whore.  I discovered r/seduction when I was trying to rebound off my hot spanish friend.  I was friendzoned, but intrigued by this community.

So last night I decided to get some practice, thinking that all I would get is rejection.  I went to a club down the street and as I was pulling in I was overcome by AA.  I remember thinking ""WTF am I doing?""...  I sucked it up, paid the cover, and wandered in.  

I was intimidated by any group of girls that had a guy with them, but I eventually found a section with an open seat at the bar in between two pairs of girls.  One pair were HB6's, so I felt most comfortable and tried the ""blind date"" opener.  It worked AMAZINGLY well, and got the conversation going.  One girl had a barbell piercing right in between her huge tits.  She said she liked my  personality and that I was cute.  I ignore the piercing for a while then ask her about it.  She literally took my hand, and made me feel the bar under the skin...  Then she was making fun of a girl sitting a few feet away for wearing a short, tight dress that looked like it was made of electrical tape.  First chance I got, I turned around and starting talking to that girl.

Turns out electrical tape girl was Brazilian, HB8, and barely spoke english.  I asked her what her dress was made out of, and then about her accent.  She was very tipsy, and very touchy feely.  I was grabbing her ass within 5 minutes of meeting her.  

The conversation started to die, so I went back and talked to cleavage piercing girl.  After a while, she and her friend ask me to save their seat while they go to the bathroom.  They never came back, but as I turned around I realized that some other guy had already moved in on the hot Brazilian.  I took a seat at the bar and discreetly pinched her ass while coyly looking away.  She ruffled my hair, and made this other guy BUY ME DRINKS for the rest of the night.  He dragged her onto the dance floor, and she turned around to me and winked..  I waited a bit and went out to join them.  As soon as she saw me, she ignored him and grinded on me.  We eventually made it back to the bar, which was closing soon so I said I was leaving.  She took my phone without asking, and put her number in it.  I pointed to my cheek and she gave me a wet sloppy kiss, right in front of the other guy.  I thanked the guy for the drinks and left.

I expected to get frustrated and be alone all night.  Holy fuck, this shit actually works.  Why didn't I know about this sooner??  If I can do it, anyone can.

I'm in college, so I went up to girls and said my thing.

The first approach was one of the most difficult I've ever done, I was sweating bullets up until the moment I said ""You're hot."" But she smiled the biggest smile I've ever seen and told me she had a boyfriend. I said no worries, and she told me ""But you're very nice!""

No success, but that was fucking awesome! After that, I had no fear walking up to women. The next single girl seemed very interested to take me up on my offer, but was leaving tomorrow to study abroad. Still, she gave me her number, so it's a win. Another girl I approached seemed absolutely stunned by what was happening, she couldn't believe she was having this conversation. But every time I pressed her with ""is that a no?"" she simply kept up the conversation until at last she gave me her phone number. ""Maybe,"" she said, ""we'll see."" After this approach a friend of mine who happened to be nearby and I were chatting, I was talking about whose number I had gotten, when he pointed out a very cute girl passing nearby. I went up and asked her out, and she said ""Yeah, I heard you talking about it just now."" I was a little bummed, but I figured that if we went out I would tell her about this anyway, and if a girl doesn't have that sense of humor I probably don't want to spend much time with her in the first place. So I told her what I was doing and how fantastically fun it is. After a minute or two of chatting she says with a sly grin, ""Alright, give me your number. I'll think about this."" I'm fine giving them my number and waiting for them to call, if they actually respond it means that they're probably someone I'd like to meet.

All in all I approached 5 girls, two of whom had boyfriends (but they couldn't have been sweeter about it). In the span of 15 minutes I got 3 phone numbers from attractive women. F'ing A.

It was awesome, I definitely intend to do this again in the future and I highly recommend this experiment for anyone trying to get better at dealing with women.

Edit: To anyone freaking out about this getting so much attention, lighten the fuck up!  This post is making fun of PUA jargon, and at the same time making a valid point. Seduction is about being the most valuable, authentic version of yourself possible. I had the worst AA in the past, overcame it, and became what some consider a mPUA.This led to sexual addiction and eventually the guilt, loneliness, and detachment put me back at square one. (Thanks Kaskade.) Now I am starting a new approach to make genuine interactions with others rather than manipulating women into taking their clothes off.

I went to a big music festival Saturday.  So many women, I got pretty silly and just started hitting on everyone.  Had a blast huge confidence, got one kiss, and a couple phone numbers.  But that's not the FR.

My field report is about some straight up James Bond Gangster pick-up I did yesterday in the grocery store.  

First of all, I'm pretty bad at day game generally, I think it's because my confidence is not as high when the atmosphere is not positive and fun.  The grocery store always seemed like a waste land, people barely speak to each other, it's like a bunch of robots or something.

OK, so I'm at the grocery store.  It's an upscale place where they have people giving out samples everywhere.  Really good fish market, good produce, etc..  Hopefully I've painted the scene.

That's where I see this amazing perfect 10.  She looks vaguely Puerto Rican, which makes me lose my mind.  She's over at one of the stands sampling something when I notice her.  I'm literally 100 yards away, this market is crowded as fuck, but I start making my way over.

By the time I get near her, she's at a different sample table trying little hamburgers or something.  I'm still running at 150% confidence level from the night before as I make my approach.

I got nothing. So I just say, ""Does your boyfriend know that you're sneaking food at the grocery store?""  I get a little laugh, and she says something like, ""I know right? It's embarrassing.""  I say ""where is he, I'll keep a look out while you stuff your face.""  She tells me that she has no boyfriend so she can eat all the food she wants.

Then I just straight up tell her ""You know there are these places called restaurants where you can sit down and have complete meals.""  I get her laughing a little more, and got that number.

**TL'DR** It took less than 3 minutes to get a number from the hottest friggen woman I've ever spoken to.  Blissin out right now.

A PUA is a carpenter with a different tool box. Seddit used to be a discussion about the best ways to use these tools. People would share ideas, others would test them and report back what worked. Others provided ideas how to improve different tools. Just like carpenters building better and better houses, PUAs were improving their tool boxes to pick up hotter and hotter women. The end was the goal. 

This has all changed. Lately, white knights and manboobs have flooded Seddit and imposed their own set of morals on to our tools. They have shamed us for our language, and our techniques. It has grown so bad people are adding disclaimers to their posts asking not to be judged harshly.

A hammer is neither good nor bad. A screwdriver can be used for good or evil. A carpenter's tools have no inherent moral value. A saw can be used to build a home or kill a man, this does not make the saw an evil thing.

Our tools are no different!

Please stop imposing your own moral code on to others. You might not like the tools discussed here. You might be offended. If this is the case please leave.

To avoid shaming techniques the advice on Seddit has changed to different forms of ""be all you can be,"" or worse, ""be yourself."" The way to get better at picking up women, it is said, is to pick up women. This advice is akin to telling an apprentice carpenter to, ""go build that house, then build another one, and so on until you can build good houses."" You can see this is bad advice if the apprentice doesn't know how to swing a hammer or read plans.

Let's go back to discussing hammers, and drills, and saws, so we can all build amazing houses.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_1aaroh,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1aaroh/seduction_is_a_tool_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/,

I've been lurking for a long time, but finally my game is starting to improve.

I want to share something that's reduced my flake out rate.

**Calling the girl after you # Close.**

Crazy right?

After seeing [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLlKnXx1p2c) I thought I'd give it a try.

But first, let me tell you about before:

I'm part of the generation in their 20s who grew up through their teens texting girls or talking to them via MSN chat, so like you I find texting to be a matter of habit. But I used to get flaked on like ash crumbling between my fingers, when I would try and set up a date.

And I realised why, my game is spontaneous. It's all about Not Giving a Fuck and saying random things while teasing the girl. That just doesn't translate well through text for me. Especially as the girl can text back when she wishes. (About 2 hours later, after I've been anxious over 5 minutes what she's going to say, I become a nervous wreck and eat lots of peanut butter. When she texts back, I'm over this, and can't be arsed to get back into the zone of talking to her.)

So now. If I like a girl after # closing, and I have the intention to eventually try and go for the F Close, I call her.

Usually during the interaction, after I get her number, I tell her I'm going to call her and talk about [insert random topic here]. If she's a fun girl we'll probably shoot the shit over that and then I eject.

THEN I call her. When? Once I left it till 3 days, called her.

I didn't say ""Oh hi HB, I'm that guy who bla bla.""

I said, ""Hey [reference hilarious joke/topic during our interaction]"". From there my game comes naturally as I'm talking over the phone. It's like real life, except you can't make eye contact.

Better than a bunch of ASCII digits on a device smaller than my hand. People who get F closes from texting, I salute you. But it just doesn't work for me.

So if you've been getting flakes after texting, or want to mix it up. Try CALLING the girl. Be a fucking Alpha Male.

1361301879.0,312,self.seduction,18u1rc,Be Shameless,379,67,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/18u1rc/be_shameless/,"Shame. It's one of the biggest indicators of the nice guy. The nice guy is always worried he'll do the inappropriate and get disgraced for it. He doesn't wanna be `that guy.' The creeper. 

But the bad boy knows that one of the best compliments he can get from a woman is, ""You're shameless!"" It means she thinks he doesn't care what women think of him. That's so attractive. You can use this to your advantage by purposely putting yourself in situations to demonstrate shamelessness. Here are some ways to do that. 

---------

I'm in the middle of conversation with a woman. I look down at her necklace. I say, ""That's interesting"" as I reach over and touch it. 

As I touch the necklace, I just barely touch her breasts with the back of my hand. 

I put the necklace down and look at her as I say, ""Nice necklace... And I wasn't trying to touch your tits... Okay, actually I was."" 

They always laugh.

---------

Whenever a girl asks, ""Do you do this with all the girls?"" my response is always, ""Yes."" 

""Do you take all your dates to this bar?"" She asks. ""Yes,"" I respond.

""Do you play [this game](http://approachanxiety.com/2010/09/instant-sexual-vibe-on-your-first-date/) with all your dates?"" she asks. ""Yes I do."" 

Most guys would sputter and try to pretend they came up with it just for her. Fuck that. You don't know her that well. Don't try to make her feel like she's the most special thing ever. 

Recently, I invited a girl out on a second date over text. She responds, ""Okay, I'll do Thursday if you agree to pick someplace you haven't previously brought a bunch of bitches. Deal?""

""You drive a hard bargain,"" I respond. 

---------

Last week I was with a girl in a bar. The conversation got sexual pretty quick. A bit later she asks me, ""Be honest, were you thinking about taking me home when we talked about that stuff?""

""Honestly?"" I respond.

""Honestly,"" she says.

""No."" I tell her and I let it sink in.

""Okay,"" she says, looking at me suspiciously.

""But I was thinking about fucking you over there in that hallway."" She punches my arm.

---------

**This doesn't mean that you should always go for the sex move and always be sexual.** You of course need to temper this with some disinterest. The vibe I'm trying to give off is that I want to fuck her, but if I don't fuck her, I don't really care. 

---------

It's a third date. We just ate in restaurant. It's near her place. It's freezing cold out. I wouldn't mind going back to her place and hooking up with her, but at the same time, I'm not going to put myself out there. So I throw it out there. 

""Let's go back to your place for a little bit.""

""I don't know about that..."" she starts to protest.

I cut her off at the end of the sentence with, ""Alright. I'm catching a cab."" And I physically turn and start walking away from her. I really am going to catch a cab because I'm not in the mood for any bullshit.

At that point she stops me and says we can hang out at her place for a while. ""A while"" ends up being all night.

---------

With another girl, it was a first date. I had moved her to a bar that was closer to my place. It's getting to the end of our drink and we're talking about leaving. She asks where the trains are so she can go home. I tell her. She asks where I live. I point to an apartment complex you can see from the window of the bar. 

""See that building right there? That's where I live.""

""Are you trying to get me closer to your place?!"" she protests.

""No,"" I say. ""I'm trying to get ME closer to my place."" 

As we walk out of the bar she asks, ""Where are we going now? Am I getting on the train? Are we going to another bar? Going to see your cat?""

""We're going to see my cat,"" I tell her and we head back to my place together for the night.

1337523370.0,312,self.seduction,tvzbm,"[FR] - Used the old ""fall off the couch"" trick last night. Worked better than expected.",396,84,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tvzbm/fr_used_the_old_fall_off_the_couch_trick_last/,"I don't know if this belongs here or not, but here I go: so I was watching a movie with this gorgeous little lady at my place. It was the second or third time I was seeing her. See, my biggest weakness with women is that I never really touch them with sexual tension in mind. I've been trying to work on that. Anyway, all the escalating in this FR happened very abruptly. It worked for me!

So the movie is about halfway in and the only touching that went on was between our knees. She wasn't running away, but she wasn't leaning in either, so the move was on me. Because of the way she was positioned, a good 20cm away from the center of the couch, there was just no way for me to make a move without saying something- so I looked at her and I said ""hey, are you hot over there?"" and I patted the free space between us. I think she got the hint, because she moved right beside me and put her hand on my knee. I think I complimented her long hair then, as I wrapped my arm around her.

Movie finishes. Damn I wish I hadn't closed my laptop, this would be the perfect time for some Joao Gilberto.

*Sidenote on Joao Gilberto: download that shit it's good with women when you want a chill, quiet moment. Also in bossa nova, look into Stan Getz / The Girl From Ipanema / Antonio Carlos Jobim / etc... For something a little more exotic, try Avishai Cohen or Idir. When you want something more fun and upbeat, try Chromeo: I've only met one woman who didn't care for that band, and she was a little cray.*

So we're still in shock by the ending of the movie and the ending credits are going by. I will take this opportunity to say that if there's one thing you need to master in conversational skills, it's the art of a good silence. I'm talking a good 5-10 seconds of silence at least. It makes the other person feel like they have to say something, and used **judiciously** silence is an extremely powerful tool.

I gave this girl a bit of my well-practiced silence, because it was contextually appropriate. She started talking. It sounded a little nervous, and she didn't stop talking about nothing and everything for a good five minutes before I looked at her. As soon as she made eye contact and stopped speaking, I dove in and explored her amygdala with my tongue. (Is there an antonym for ""euphemism""? I think this qualifies.)

She almost-accidentally ended up sitting on top of me and I undid her bra. I then proceed to peel her like an onion (we live in a somewhat nordic country where it's customary to wear clothes...). She stops me before I can take off her shirt, gives me one of these looks and says ""You know, I'm not that easy"".

Oh shit. Challenge accepted. I like it when they you have to work for them a little.

I say something along the lines of ""I would never have thought anything like that"" but I don't think it matters what I said. I leaned her on the couch and started making out with her. This is where the old couch trick comes into play. I make myself fall off the edge of the couch and try to make it seem as real as possible. I think I did fairly well. I appeared off balance and startled for a brief second, then we laughed and I said ""my couch appears to be a little too small... let's go in my bed, we'll be more comfortable"".

And she said ""sure"" with a little smile. Well orchestrated!

I will take comments, suggestions and insults below! :)

As a followup from this post:  http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/162hxy/approaching_a_mean_or_cold_girlits_like_the_whole/

I set up the date in a single text on Monday afternoon to give her a day or two to be thinking of me and the date.

Monday Afternoon Text:

Me: Let's grab that coffee Wednesday night

Her: I have class till 6 but that's fine

Done. I'm not going to confirm it. She can wonder for a couple days. This isn't the girl who I'd text back a, ""Great, see you then!"" I set the date, she gave me a time that works for her, it's done.

Wait a couple days.. and now to confirm.

**Wednesday Afternoon Text:**

Me: I'll pick you up at 7:00, dress warm.

Her: Oh my. Sounds good

I've piqued her interest, she thinks we're grabbing coffee. We are, to-go. Then I'm taking her ice skating. (I'm going to have an extra pair of gloves in my car just in case she doesn't dress warm enough. Learn to accommodate, gentlemen.)

I doubt this girl has ever been taken on a nice date by a guy with goals, ambitions or a future. This is a perfect DHV *(Demonstration of Higher Value)* which she could probably use.

Want to hear about the date now? Oh wait, I haven't gone on it yet. T minus 1 hour until I go to pick her up, I'll be back tonight to update this post.

No, I won't be getting laid, because I won't be trying. I doubt she's even getting a kiss. I'm not trying to make this girl a fling, FWB, or ONS.

Frankly, I don't know if she could handle that emotionally. I'm not an asshole, and I'm taking the advice from fellow redditors in that first post. I'm also leaving my emotions at home before I go out tonight, this could get difficult.

Upvote this post for visibility. That original post got 250 points and I said I'd update a few people. I'm a man to my word, and this OP is not a faggot.



*Forget karma, bitch. This is a throwaway on a PUA subreddit and I'm going to have a fucking update for you in a few hours. The orange arrow is up there!*

**EDIT: Alright, here's a quick blurb of what happened.**

Let me start by saying, this girl is fucking crazy.

I didn't know enough about her in my first post to come to that conclusion, but after 6 hours with her - it's determined.

You guys might not find her crazy, but here are my key facts from the evening (I'll break them down in further detail later)

She's materialistic 

She knows she has issues

She's somehwat ""proud"" of them

She's intimidated by my texts, and I quote, ""It's like I'm texting a 30 year old.""

She's reasonably good at ice skating


Immediately when I picked her up, she started talking about another guy she just met. Red fucking flag. I wasn't about to let this girl play any games so I started some casual conversation and just ignored whatever she said about him. It went something along the lines of,

Me: ""So do you have any idea where we're going?""

Her: ""No, you never told me.""

Me: ""Okay, good.""

I took her to coffee first, got out of the car and said, ""This is our first stop."" She asked, ""How many stops are there?"" so naturally, I decided to say, ""Well that depends on when I feel like taking you home.""

The ball was in my court, and she knew it.

We got back in the car and headed downtown, and we ended up on the subject of dating/relationships pretty quickly. ""I like guys with money."" Not a single fucking ounce of hesitation. I laughed her off. ""Are you fucking serious?"" I said, ""You have absolutely no shame."" She doesn't, and she's proud of it. We bantered casually, but I had to seriously question her morals and ethics. This girl has never worked for anything a day in her life, never earned a dime, and is damn proud of it.

Frankly, that's just her upbringing. But fuck if it doesn't make me want to leave her on the side of the road.

Anyways, we go ice skating, she comments about how she doesn't want to leave her new Uggs boots near other peoples' shoes and how many times the skates had been worn before her. I was almost at my limit, so I just kind of went with it. I felt like the only words in my head were repeating themselves after everything she said, ""Are you fucking serious?"" She was. Every time.

So we ice skate, it's cute, I don't try and hold her hand or anything - because this girl is COLDER than the fucking ice we're carving.

We finish up, get our shoes, and head back to my car. When we were almost back to our neighborhood, I gave her an ultimatum. ""You have two options. I can drop you off now, or we can grab a 6-pack and kick it at my place up the street."" 

I got a measly, ""I don't care."" out of her. Fine. Shit test? Maybe. So what do I say? ""Alright,"" as I pulled into the gas station, ""I'll grab a 6-pack for me and then take you home."" She was a little bit shocked, and I told her to wait in the car.

I get back in and go straight to my house. We go in, I show her around a bit, introduce her to the roomies, and take her up to my room. We crack a beer, I put on some music and started some more casual conversation. She kept contradicting herself, and it was like pulling teeth to get anything worthwhile out of her. I would call her out whenever she sounded absolutely nuts. Once again, she was fucking proud of herself and didn't give two shits.

I went to grab another beer and she made some smartass comment, so I flipped her off blatantly on my way down the stairs and she giggled. This fucking girl, guys. God.

Every time I saw her look at the clock or her phone, I would ask her if she was getting tired or tell her that I'm far more interesting than her news feed.

So it's getting late, she's sitting on my bed, and I say, ""Let's get you home."" 

We pile back into my car, and I drop her off. She's waiting for the kiss. Sorry, I'm not putting this fucking car in Park. I told her to, ""run along."" As soon as she shut the door I drove off.

My thoughts: This girl isn't in fact ""proud"" of her upbringing, lifestyle, or apathy towards, well, everything. She's just dealing with all of this the only way she knows how - getting what she wants.

Also, I'm tired as fuck and I'm happy to clarify anything - just ask. There was plenty more that's hard to summarize.

The bottom line is that a gentle touch is much stranger and scarier for AMOGs than a harsh touch, and it doesn't really give them a good reason to get into a violent confrontation with you. Here's an example of what I'm talking about.

This weekend I was at a music festival in line to get water from a bar. We were crammed in there like sardines. Being me, I open the cute girl in front of me and the really huge guy next to her goes into monster-douche-mode. He turns to look at me (still wearing sunglasses at night in a dark room) and just starts repeating the question ""Are you gay? Are you gay? Are you gay?"" over and over again while I'm talking to the girl. Because of how close we are, ignoring him is not an option. ""That depends,"" I say, ""Are you interested?"" I reach out and stroke his arm lightly. The girl laughs. He goes quiet, so I go in for the AMOG kill as I continue to touch him. ""Is this your boyfriend?"" I ask her. She says no, and laughs at the idea. He turns red. ""Great!"" I say, stroking his arm some more ""So he's not taken?"" More laughs from the girl. She's now not paying attention to her loser friend, and is completely focused on me.

This is my best solution to being called gay by another guy, but it also illustrates a larger principle that a light and effeminate touch can have some really weird effects on an AMOG.

1339164812.0,305,self.seduction,urkzc,Some tips for beginners,379,74,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/urkzc/some_tips_for_beginners/,"For those who don't know me I've been in a field for a year now, and I live in one of the biggest pick up cities. I go out a lot, just went out yesterday, although I don't write FR's anymore unless it's something exciting like make out, venue change, a date, or a lay.

There is a bar I go to that has about 5-15 puas in a given night. Sometimes I talk to them for a minute, but then I end up ditching them, for the reasons below, most of them are there for mental masturbation and ego validation seeking, and get absolutely no results, except for maybe 1 or 2 out of 15.

So here are the tips

1. When you're out at night, do not talk about pick up. You should be opening girls instead.
2. Stay away from people who talk about pick up when they're out at night, these are the people who do not get the girls.
3. Don't bullshit yourself, there is way too much fucking theory out there, just take action (open sets, build connections, and escalate)
4. Don't think what you could have done, or couldn't, to get that one set. Just keep opening more and more sets. When you get home then you could think about what you could have done to improve. Usually it's not something specific to a set, but a symptom of a bigger problem: lack of sexual confidence, not being assertive, conversation, etc..
5. You can not win every girl, rejection is part of the game, rejection is a TOOL used for screening which girls are DTF or dateable, or which aren't. If you're not getting rejected, you're not pushing yourself or being assertive enough.
6. Do not stand around doing nothing, understand that you're avoiding your fears
7. Don't bullshit yourself with ""I'm just here to have fun"", no you came out to pickup, if you're not talking to girls, you're bullshitting yourself. Also don't bullshit yourself with theory and talking to other people about it (like in point 3.)
8. Don't eject, anyone who tells you that they are ""building social proof"" or ""planting seeds"" is bullshitting himself and is not getting any results. Open the set, and stick in there regardless how uncomfortable it feels, you need to work through your comfort zone and that's the best way to desensitize it.  The goal should be to open a set, build a connection, find out how DTF they are, get logistics, escalate, and then try to bounce them. If they are not DTF/bad logistics, get her phone number and find a new girl. This can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes. Most beginners have problems with ejecting though, rather than being in the set for too long, so at least try to stick in for 5-10 minutes.
9. Only way to get better is to desensitize your fears, this means you need to go out everyday, and do 3-5 approaches, at least 20-30 approaches a week. When you're out at night, try to do 3-4 approaches per hour. Once you overcome one fear, you will find another fear, you need to keep on pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, that's the only way to improve, no theory can do that for you.
10. Last but not least, stop all the bullshit theory and mental masturbation. Just take action, and when you get stuck at a sticking point or fear you can read a little bit of theory on how to find a solution and take action again. First priority is action. Only the bold and those who take risks are rewarded.

I hope to see more field reports on seddit.

Don't approach at the gym. It's creepy, they say. The girls are there to work out and don't want to be bothered.

I can't think of any other place that has the same reputation for being a ""No Approach"" zone. Even funerals would probably be considered more appropriate for pick-up in the eyes of some. But after being a member of various gyms for years, daydreaming about the fit, unattainable women on the eliptical machines and wishing I had the balls to talk to them, I finally made my first approach.

The girl was wearing earbuds while doing an ab workout. I always finish up my workouts with light stretching anyway, so I pulled up a yoga mat and sat down. While she was resting in between sets I smiled and motioned to her that I wanted to say something and she took her headphones out. She smiled as I asked if she was new to the gym (I'm a regular and had never seen her before). It was her first day there, she said, and she was just choosing random exercises. When I asked for her number she blushed and literally got up and ran to the locker room to get her phone. I added her number and ejected so she could get back to working out and texted her a half-hour later with my contact info.

I kept the texting to a minimum from then on until I could set up a date, at which point I CALLED to ask her out -- this makes you stand out, gentlemen. We went out to dinner a couple days later, hit up a cool bar nearby and I showed her how to play a drinking game. I offered her a breath mint and she said, ""What, you think you're gonna kiss me?"" I smiled and said, ""Yes,"" grabbed her by the scarf and pulled her in for a quick makeout. We took a cab back to my place and I explored her tight, sexy, gym-shaped body.

So, for a final note of encouragement: Since seeing this girl, she has described telling her friends and family about meeting me as if she couldn't believe it happened (""This random guy just came up to me..."") She was shocked because so few guys have the balls to approach like that; even said it seemed like ""fate."" As anyone who follows this stuff knows, it's not about fate.

Most people don't come to class with a large group that they already know, so sit down next to a random girl or a guy and just introduce yourself! This is a fantastic way to expand your social circles and because it's early in the semester it relieves some of the social pressure off of you. 

Just today I sat down between two girls I'd never met before and struck up a conversation with them. The professor mentioned we'd be doing a group project to get to know others in class so we all quickly agreed that we would be working together. If I'd gone and sat alone who knows who I would have ended up with?

1350947975.0,309,self.seduction,11wqpa,The 3 dates game,404,95,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11wqpa/the_3_dates_game/,"So here i am again with the second great advice my friend gave me if you are interested in the first read [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11v8ks/a_great_advice_a_friend_gave_me_to_help_me_to/).

The 3 dates game: This as you may have guessed is a ""slow"" attraction building and its also great to get to know the girl you are interested with in a ""safe way"". Since you let the tension pretty much to built itself and i find it as a great technique for people that are struggling with AA, but PUAs may find it useful to depending in the situation. I will Also use an example of a HB9.5 i got using this method.

I have been using this with girls i have already know, but did not know how to open them doe to various circumstances (but pretty much because i had no much game at the time).

Also this ""game"" works well for places that are not naturally picking up places like clubs/bars, like work, supermarkets, the street literally anyway you want.

**THE BUILD UP:** You meet this girl, she is gorgeous you like her, you chat her up, and what my friend and i always do is being funny not flirty but funny, learn a few silly jokes, *bitches love silly jokes*, i for one hated this silly jokes thing i'm a more of a cynic dark humor joker, but unless the girl is the exact same as you in your humor 9 of every 10 times they will be put off by this dark sense of humor.


So back to the build up, you chat her up make her laugh, ask about what she does what she like, but just that don't inquire more about her, and she will ask you what you do/like in return, just to make small chat too, if she does not ask, just state what you do and 1 thing you like, but just that, and again do it in a funny way, and then after a few minutes (not more than 30), you very casually tell her ""hey xxx you are pretty fun i have to go, but i want to see you again, giver me your number"", she will give it to you, WHY? because you are a fun interesting guy, this few minutes you made her laugh and have a good time, so she obviously wants to repeat that. Later that same day you text her something simple, ""hey lets go tomorrow to X place, meet me  there at Y hour"", just This something simple, don't tell her you liked her, or had a good time, just arrange the date, preferably for the next day or the day after, don't let her cool down. And invite her too a place YOU like, a place that is not a club/bar, a fun place, like an arkadia, circus, street circus, literally a place you go just to have fun. I recommend against going to the movies, because you can't talk or do anything but KINO, but you don't want to do that just yet.

EXTRA NOTE: This is also a very good way of asking people you already know, to go out with you workmates/classmates etc.


**THE FIRST DATE:**So what happened? you just got yourself a date, with a HB to a place you like. You meet her there, and here comes the part you need to do, *JUST HAVE FUN* that's right you are the place you like and don't focus on making the moment for her of even build up attraction, you just have fun and invite her to be part of YOUR fun, you keep Kino to a minimun, don't complement her if she looks good, not even if she really dressed up really nicely to the date, tease her in a jokingly way, grab her hand to move her to a place or another, but don't hold her hand, guide her by the small of her back, this is just to make her feel more comfortable with you, and show dominance, because you are deciding what are you doing and in result you are having a lot of fun. After a point you will start to do some RAPORT not much, keep things light. Then after what you planned its over, you just finish the night, no going after to a bar, or a caffe, state that you had a fun time, and you will call her/text her to see her again. This is important don't make plans at the same day, if she ask you when will she will be seeing you again just say you are a little busy and you will call her/text her when you have an opening in your agenda.

* What happens here, when she first met you, you asked her out at the next day pretty quickly, but what will you do now?, you will wait at least 4 days to ask her out again. And this is because you will remain in her head for all those days, why did ALOSS invited me to a date (because believe, you did not said it was a date, but it was a date in her eyes), why did he not said i was pretty, does he likes me as a friend or something more? you are an enigma for her, and the more a girl thinks of you, the more she will like you. SON the attraction pretty much build it self right there BOOM!.
This is extremely more effective with hotter girls, because they are used to the guys to take her where she wants, to complement her a lot, to try to get into her pants, but not you, you are different you are a guy that in a couple of days made her life more fun and interesting, and she wants a guy like that in her life.

* Some people will say, ""but Aloss, this will get me friend-zoned"", no no no, FUCK THAT, a friend-zoned guy is an AFC who from the start did things to please her, that puts her needs as a priority instead of his, a chump whom constantly qualifies her, just to try to keep her around, a sad excuse of a man, who does not stand up from himself.


After the first date and in between the days before you ask her out, there is bound to be some texting from her or maybe even calls, avoid this as much as possible, don't be a dick, just if she calls let her make the conversation, because  if she is calling you is a pretty strong IOI, so let her qualify herself making her keep the chat going, but not more than 5-10 minutes at the time, remember you are busy, and in the most likely case when she text you, use this rule wait at least 15 minutes after the first text to respond, and wait at least the double of time that she takes to reply to you, for you to reply back, ( she takes 1 hour to reply, you take 2), but at least always wait 15 minutes.

**THE SECOND DATE:** You are doing pretty fine so far, you let attraction build itself, you became a great value giver in her life, and for the past couple of days, the only thing she thinks about is you.
So after at least 4 days, you call her or text her ""hey HB, meet me at X at Y hour, i want to see you"".

You invite her now to a ""date place"" restaurant, a caffe. You meet her and now you can start with a complement qualify how well she dressed or how her shoes match her outfit not just her looks, but the effort she put in her outfit. Now in this date you do start to put use the things you have learned in seddit, take space a more in depth RAPORT, kino building, you done with the first place, take her to a walk, hold her hand or put your arm for her, you are taking the attraction she already has for you and create now sexual/romantic attraction for you. You could go later to a bar, but don't drink or let her drink more than 2 drinks, don't want the alcohol blind you, because this date it's also important for you to find out what you really want of this girl. If she is really worth been a GF, just a casual fling, or a FB.

*  This is where my friend and i differ a little bit, he likes to wait to the 3rd date to make things physical, i like to end the date with a kiss, not make out just a romantic perfect kiss, to end a perfect night in her eyes.

*  Also at this point you could also skip to date 3, and take her home to f-close, but i would recommend this only if you look for a fling or a FB. If you want her to be something more, end the night with just the kiss, make that night a perfect romantic night in her memory, believe me she will be telling that story to everyone, the perfect romantic night with the most awesome guy she ever met.

**THE THIRD DATE:** The set up for the third date is fairly simple, just ask her to your place, for what ever reason, this is not really a date, she will come to your place, and immediately jump you, the three times I've done this literally they jumped the moment i closed the door, i tell them we are eating and watching a movie at my place, but we never get to that.
If you don't live alone, see if she does, or arrange something, what the third date is all about is intimacy, been alone, just you and her.

And my brothers, this i say from me heart *""fuck her good, fuck her hard""* Because if you can make a girl have a good time in and out of the bed, mate she will be yours.


Later today i'll try to post a [FR] of the HB9.5 i mentioned earlier, since this little post was way bigger than i expected.

Have a good  day mates.

Do you find yourself wondering about a girl and whether to ask her out?

Just do it.

I'm serious.

Just DO it.

Did you come up with a list of things that makes you think she's attracted to you? Or a list of reasons you don't think she's attracted to you?

Well, that's a fancy list, but f*ck that shit.

Ask the girl out.

She doesn't have to have LTR relationship potential if that's not what you're looking for.

In fact, she doesn't have to have anything you're looking for aside from looks, at first, because there's no way to know if she's got any of those things if you don't make a move and spend time with her. If you can't see how she behaves in that context, you've got nothing on her. She is a face, and a name, until you get to know her.

You won't get to know her unless you spend time with her - women can say lots of things about themselves. There's no way to know if she's bullshitting if you don't ask her out.

How many of you start out thinking ""I'd really like to ask this girl out because she's a really good fit for me - she gets my humor, she likes the things I like, etc etc etc""?

I'm happy for you, bro, I'mma let you finish, but seriously, if you haven't made a move yet, all you have is a list of things that you like about a girl.

Make. A. Move.

Call it a date. Call it a meet-up. Call it a box social, I don't care. Just make a move.

If she says no, she says no.

This will keep you from writing 5 page questions on Seddit, asking about whether you should ask a girl out. Which, honestly, is probably the most common question I get.

Holla!

1330443779.0,303,self.seduction,q9rwe,"[LR] Thanks Seddit (and the community in general). 32 year old, lost my virginity last friday",368,65,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/q9rwe/lr_thanks_seddit_and_the_community_in_general_32/,"So yeah, it can be done folks. I read 'The game' last March and decided to get out of my foreveralone status. Started going out regularly since August, nearly every day since December, read a ton of material and approached a lot of girls. Most of my level-ups were completely unexpected (first romantic kiss, first make-out, first girl brought home from the bar (epic story including stripper, crazy boyfriend, weed, smashed wine-bottles, hidden knives, insta-marriage proposal from the taxi driver, dead cat, make-outs and boobs but no sex), and now first lay, all with different girls).

Nothing very noteworthy about the interaction itself. I'd talked to the girl a few weeks ago, for a couple of hours maybe (typical stuff like job/travel/what you look for in a man/woman). She seemed interested in me (light leg touching), but I didn't push for anything and she left with her friend to a club. No contacts exchanged. 
Saw her again this last Friday at about 1:00 AM at the same bar. She was with some friends. I'd been seriously out-of-state, not talked to any girl yet (been at the bar since 6:30 PM). She recognized me (like 'hey I remember you') and we started talking, catching up on stuff. I then went direct, said I was attracted to her, but was not looking for a girlfriend, but just a fuck-buddy. She said she'd not done that before, only had boyfriends. I asked if she wanted to try it, she said yeah I'll go home with you but no guarantees. Zero kino so far and one kiss attempt rejected. I also tell her I'm a virgin. About 1:30 AM she tells her friends that she's taking me home and we leave. I stay farther away, so we head to her place. Discuss some life philosophy on the way. No LMR. I couldn't get a good hard-on, probably due to the drinks/condom/nervousness/porn etc (although i was on nofap for about 7 days till then), but got her to come orally/digitally (technique learnt from watching a lot of porn). Tried masturbating but couldn't get that done either. Fingered her ass a bit. She suggested I stay over and we go to bed (I couldn't sleep actually). Next morning I get her off again, have a cup of tea, exchange contacts and I said I'll be in touch and maybe meet-up for a coffee to decide if we want to continue with the FB thing. Got home and fapped off to porn since it'd gotten painful by then.

The next couple of days, I start seeing women as a lot more beautiful when I'm out and about (at the mall etc), I get attracted to even those I wouldn't give a second glance previously. I feel almost confident enough to approach direct during the day, possibly due to the now-certain knowledge that I can get a girl to come consistently.

Tangentially, as a result of learning game, I've lost a lot of fear of public speaking, look a lot better, possibly got a great job offer and have made peace with my life.

I was playing a game called Humans vs Zombies. It's basically a glorified game of tag played across a college campus. My friends and I were cutting through a parking lot to get home when we saw a group of people who weren't playing, two dudes and two girls.

One of the guys shouts ""I bet you can't hit me from there!"" He's about fifty yards away. I pulled out my pvc-pipe blowgun and took a shot - missed by a couple inches. While retrieving my dart, one of the girls starts talking to me about HvZ.

Here's my little victory. The guy I almost hit comes up and interrupts by saying ""Man you sure know how to blow, you're real good at blowing."" Without missing a beat, I turned and said ""What can I say? I've had a lot of practice."" Then I looked him up and down, winked and said ""What are you doing tonight?"" 

The guy was literally dumbfounded - he just kinda stuttered for a few seconds - and the girl laughed. Awesome! I talked for another minute with the girl and left. 

Compared to a lot of stuff I read on here, this wasn't really anything, but for me this was huge! I successfully agreed and amplified, I stopped an AMOG in his tracks and I had a genuine conversation with a stranger about something of which I am passionate. The stuff here actually works. Definitely something I'll remember next time I'm feeling AA.

Alright, so I've been lurking on Seddit for about a month and I am blown away by all the great advice and have been very excited to try it out. But let me reiterate to new people like myself, there is A LOT of advice, waaaay too much to keep in mind all at once when you are getting out there for the first time and talking to women. This is why I decided to approach this whole thing with baby steps. The three goals of my weekend, as random as they may sound, were: maintain great eye contact, smile as you speak, and just have fun(outcome independent). Well I must say, it worked fantastically well.

I was in a large group of friends and one of the girls in the group had expressed to a friend a few weeks ago that she thought I was attractive. My old thought process would have had me focus on her the whole night but I wanted to try and be outgoing and meet other people at the bar while keeping flirting with her to a minimum. Well we showed up at the bar and I would grab one of my guy friends by the arm and walk up to a group of women and start talking(while maintaining great eye contact and smiling). Every group I approached were extremely happy to talk to us, even the ones with boyfriends who thought we were a lot of fun as well. Met a lot of great people.

Then I decided to grab the girl who liked me and approach a group of women and told her that she was gonna help me hit on them. She had a big grin on her face and said she would help me out and we sat and talked to a group of girls for a while and my friend left while I chatted for a bit. They were fun as well but the conversation started dwindling so I told them to have a good night and left. I started to walk outside and saw my group of friends in the corner so I started to walk their direction; the girl that liked me saw me coming and started walking toward me. I thought she was going to the bathroom so I began saying there was a line but before I could get any words out she grabbed me and started making out with me in the middle of a huge crowd of people who all stopped and began cheering us on. My. mind. was. blown. I would not have anticipated that in a million years. She kept saying how much I was driving her crazy with the way I was acting and that she felt the urge to basically attack me. We made out for a bit and then rejoined our group like nothing happened while they stared at us with huge grins.

After this I approached a few more groups and found a really cool set of girls at the end of the night to hang with and I focused in on the one I was sitting next to who was very cute. Once again I made myself conscious of maintaining eye contact and smiling. It must have worked because she seemed to get increasingly more into me. Also, I made an excuse to leave and go walk around for a bit so I wouldn't seem too into her and when I got back she said while smiling, ""I didn't know if you would come back."" Well I found out she goes to my school so I told her we should go on a lunch date and I got her number and now I have that to look forward to.

Finally, all of my friends came back to my place and we played guitar for a while. All the while my cute friend just put her arms around me and rested her head on me until everybody left and we went into my room. Guys, this was probably the most successful night of my life and I have all of you to thank.

* I did not check my phone the entire evening -  If you are checking your phone, you are NOT PRESENT.  Put the phone away!

* Opened any set as soon as something ""caught my eye"".  The universe will help you open sets, you just have to be perceptive and act on your intuition.  I opened many sets by giving a genuine complement (AUTHENTICITY).  I liked one girl's necklace, another girl's dress, another girl's crazy dance move.  I did the exact same with guys.  BEFRIEND EVERYONE (leader of men attraction switch)!  If you assume people are your friend, they will be friendly! Give a complement!  I opened several sets by just saying ""Well, HELLO EVERYONE!"".

* Fearless. Most of my fear has always been, ""What if I run out of things to say"".  What I learned this weekend is that ANY thought/fear/insecurity that pops into your head, the girls/guys will pick up on it and it develops into reality. The solution? Learn to let your mind run blank. Completely blank. I opened many sets throughout the night by just opening with ANYTHING.  If I had more to say, I'd continue and escalate.  If I didn't have anything to say, I'd just continue eye contact, sharing the moment with the girls.  I would not stare, but I wouldn't look away either"".  Just being completely present with the girl.  Sure enough, another thought will enter your mind and you can act on it, or the girls will add to the conversation.  

I was completely SHOCKED to see how I could literally just open with some attraction triggering things, and continue having eye contact with the girl for 10-30 seconds, SAYING NOTHING, THINKING NOTHING, and they would STAY.  (Remember, a girl can easily leave at any moment, turn her back, go to the bathroom).  If she is still talking to you, standing looking at you, you are doing JUST FINE.  Continue and escalate.

1299537728.0,304,self.seduction,fzbzg,Nice Guys Do Get Girls,384,80,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fzbzg/nice_guys_do_get_girls/,"I've been reading a lot of posts here that talk about how they can't get girls because they are simply too nice, girls hate nice guys, blah blah blah.  As someone who used to have this mentality, let me just say **BULLSHIT.**


**The Idea**


Self-proclaimed nice guys think that girls love douches.  Of course, the nice-guy definition of a douche is anyone who is good with women.  You can be a nice guy and be good with women.  Yes, you read that correctly, you can be nice, and still be GOOD with women.

**Wait, What?**


When you think about it, the whole nice guy syndrome is sort of a paradox within itself.  You're nice to the girl, but hide your true intentions of trying to get with the girl, usually due to a lack of confidence.  Dishonesty isn't very nice.  Meanwhile, she assumes you're not interested at all, and friendzones you, then you get pissed when some other guy comes along and sweeps her off her feet by making his intentions clear.  **Newsflash: You can be nice and make your intentions clear.**


**OH GOD, THIS SOUNDS LIKE ME!!!!**


First off, breathe. It's ok I promise.  Now tell yourself out loud ""I don't have to be a douche bag to get girls"".  Let that really sink in.  All you really need it some confidence.  But before you do that, you need to be ok with the fact that you want to meet girls.  There's NOTHING wrong with wanting girls, and you need to be OK with this fact before you move forward.  

**So What Do I Do?**


When you're interacting with a girl that you're interested in, escalate physically. I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.   Be sure to playfully tease them and flirt, and above all have fun with the interaction!  Don't put her on a pedestal and do whatever she wants simply because you're attracted to her, or be her stepping stone.  There's plenty of resources on inner game here, start looking it up.  Go listen to David Wygant.

**My Experience**


From what I see and my own nice guy experience, it seems like the majority of nice guys do OK with the interaction and talking, but don't escalate physically enough.  Another nice guy situation is that they don't know how to next a girl.  Stop getting so caught up on that one girl, there are millions of single gals out there all waiting to meet you.

**I Got Shit To Do, Wrap This Up Already**


Girls aren't attracted to douches, but they are attracted to confidence which is something that sort of goes hand in hand with being a douche.  But guess what?  You can be nice AND be confident as well.  I never will be mean to a girl, but I will playfully tease a girl where they know I'm harmlessly joking.  Now, I'm no master with women, but I've made strides without changing who I really am and you don't have to become someone you hate simply for girls.  


**TL;DR: Nice guys don't finish last.  Nice guys without confidence do.**

**Edit: There seems to be a lot of discussion talking about negging and teasing in the comments, and I look at them as separate things.  Maybe neg was the wrong word to use, what i mean is you don't need to go up to girls and insult them if that's not your style.  You could playfully tease, but I've seen guys be straight up vicious towards women, and a lot of new people think you need to go attacking their self-esteem in order for them to like you.  **",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_fzbzg,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fzbzg/nice_guys_do_get_girls/,

First, now that I have all of your upvotes, notice how I call my guides ""the definitive guide.""  Looking back, that's the exact confidence I was speaking about.  Calling it definitive says ""I know I'm right, and until one of you proves me wrong, I'll assume I know what I'm talking about.""  Luckily, I do know what I'm talking about.  

HAVING CONFIDENT BODY LANGUAGE IS NOT MIMICKING CONFIDENT BODY LANGUAGE.  I'll repeat that: HAVING CONFIDENT BODY LANGUAGE IS NOT MIMICKING CONFIDENT BODY LANGUAGE.  If you are comfortable in your own space you will have confident body language.  That's what body language is all about, and that's what all of the previous guides have missed.   


I'm going to start with core conceptual stuff, and then go into specifics.  

Let's talk body language.

--------------------

A quick note on personal space:  This varies by country, but the most important aspect of conveying confident body language is being comfortable in your space.  However much space you're taking up at any particular moment, you should be in charge of all of it.  That's the most important part of body language.  


**CONCEPTUAL MATERIAL**

**--The 4 Tenets of Confident Body Language--**

1. Be comfortable in your own space. 
2. Control your own space. 
3. Be comfortable extending your personal space.  
4. Be comfortable inviting someone else into your own personal space.  


Memorize that.  Let's talk about each one now.

**1. Be comfortable in your own space.  
**
This one is pretty straight forward.  You need to be comfortable in your own space, inhabiting whatever space you hold.  I want you to think back to your high-school cafeteria.  Remember the kid that ate alone?  He often wore his coat/jacket while he ate, despite being inside. He would eat with his elbows were locked inwards to the sides of his torso as he ate his sandwich?  He looked like a fucking Tyrannous.  I know this kid was some of you.  I was him in middle school.  

This is the classic body language of a person so awkward, they're uncomfortable in their own space.  You can see it with people who always keep their arms across themselves or postured awkwardly, afraid to move their arms out of their silhouette, uncomfortable in their own skin.  You need to free yourself of this.  Talk with your hands.  Make sure the sound comes from your mouth, but gesticulate to enhance your stories.  

*A quick note on pointing*:  Point.  Not with your index finger.  Form a circle with your index and thumb, point with you middle, ring, and pinky in a direction with your forefinger and thumb forming a ring.  That's dominant body language.   

You need to be comfortable in your space though.  Don't cross your arms.  Wave your arms outward when gesticulating, not inward, and not across your torso.  Take up space.  Take up space.  Take up space.  Take up space.  Take up space.  

That is your space.  You own it.  Be comfortable.  Take your jacket off and put it on the chair behind it.  You just annexed more space.  More on that in # 3.  

**2.  Control your own space. ** 

Everything that happens in your space should be your doing.  You can invite people into your space, but this is where that George Zimmerman Castle Doctrine does apply.  It is your space, own it.  If you're successfully pulling off what I wrote about in my last guide, your space will never be encroached upon purposefully.  But, in the same way you should be comfortable in your own space, you should be comfortable with allowing it to change.  Standing, sitting, laying down, all of these actions change your space.  This goes to number three.

**3.  Do not be afraid to extend your personal space. ** 

Lebensraum motherfucker.  You need what you need.  Take up more room than others, on the dancefloor, on the couch in a social non-intimate setting, in general.  You take up more space.  I'm no evolutionary biology science man, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe I read this is a primal element of alpha-male dominance.  

**4. Do not be afraid to invite someone else into your own personal space ** 

To be clear, no one enters without your permission.  But you should invite (primarily women) into your space.  This is hard to explain and I'm struggling how to explain this one without a video.  The key thing to explain is that it's perfectly acceptable, even encouraged to bring others intimately into your personal space.  The most important thing to establish is that you are bringing them, they are not entering freely.  That's not to say you have a gate, and unexpected visitors are unwelcome.  But by and large, you should be responsible for bringing people into your personal space.  They do not just wander in when they want.  You own your space.  Again, it's hard to explain this concept without making it sound like a symptom of autism.  You like to be touched, you touch a lot, reciprocated kino is ok, but it needs to be received by you with permission.  No one touches you without your direction, approval, and supervision.  However, touching (from women) is encouraged, approved, and supervised.  

Remember these core concepts.  They should be behind your every physical action.  

If you pull these off confidently, the physical stuff will come naturally.  Honestly, it's a lot better if you train yourself to be comfortable rather than to reproduce physical motions.  If you don't have the real confidence behind the physical motions, I can promise your body language will come off as fake, forced, and disingenuous.  Please just work on being comfortable.  It's almost counter-intuitive, but good body language is more conceptual in regards to comfort than it is about emulating specific actions.   
------------------------
Read Joe Navarro's ""What Every Body is Saying""  
**Physical Body Language**

Standing Up:

1.  Get your hands out of your pockets.  They should be at your sides, comfortably, not really touching you, but COMFORTABLE.  
 
2.  When you talk, gesture.  Palms down at least 45 degrees.  

3.  Unless a contextual reproductive action, gesture outward so you take up more space, rather than less.  

I can go more into specifics, but honestly, if you internalize my confidence guide and the 4 tenets this should *really* come to you naturally.  


Sitting down:

Go watch Mad Men.  Sit like Don Draper.  
1.  Primarily speaking, the most dominant way to sit is as follows.

1.  Sit.

2.  Rest your left ankle on your right knee.

3.  Put your left arm at your side, and your right arm straight along the seat back.  

--Reverse if necessary this so your open arm goes towards the girl

Obviously, this works best when reclined.  


3.  Walking

Look where you're going.  Take comfortable steps.  Probably a little longer and a little slower than you're used to.  Do not goose-step.  Girls aren't big on that any more.  

4.  Talking:

Humans are story tellers.  Talk.  Gesture.  Smile.  Not with your mouth.  With your eyes.  If you think about smiling with your eyes a more natural mouth smile will come out.  You're awesome.  You're interesting.  By happy.  Be awesome.  Sunshine and lollipoops.

4.1  Talking when eating

Chew your food first.  Make her wait.  Hold up your index finger to say ""one sec please.""  Smile.  It's a lot better to have 10 seconds of silence than it is for you to chew your food while you talk.

seriously. look this out:

:: She opens every kind of group.  When we take her to a walk, she will go to any kind of person with this same happy face, swinging her tail. Some people will greet her and pet. Some don’t, but for her, those people doesn’t really matter. She will just keep walking and having her time.

:: She plays by her own rules. If we take her to a walk in the park, we will be back when she decides. If we will play with her, she will choose the toy we will play with. If we play tag, we got to catch her first. 

:: Always with good energy. Lots of times, I arrive late at home. So she greets me with so much joy and calls me to play. I could be tired or had a bad day, but one does simply refuse to fetch with a lab when they call you with that happiness

:: The amount of fucks she gives is about none. Do you guys think she cares when we have to remember her that she is a dog and have to go out or that she can’t do this or that? She will just keep being awesome in another place and give zero fucks about being scolded. Join r/howtonotgiveafuck/ and be a mofo honey badger too.

:: Listen to people, learn with them and pay attention at the signs. She soon learns about how she can act with so and so people. She know what kind of games she can play or how much liberty she has with each one of the people at the house. Learn, listen, watch and adapt with the signs people gives to you.


In the end, realize it is all about YOU, not the girls. Its about your fun and rules. The girls will come if you keep your spirit high enough. Its not about you making them have fun, because a fool you are not. It is about they have fun WITH YOU.

",372,76,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16jaat/fr_because_i_fucked_this_up_when_we_were_in/,"**She will forgive you for being too aggressive, but she won't forgive you for never making a move.**    

This was a reply from a most a made about a date that went poorly for me on Friday ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16ge70/her_vs_your_idea_of_her/)). While I read all the replies and took what I could away from each of them it was the words above that stuck with me, and I was going to make them my frame on Saturday no matter what. 

The scene was a small university bar where a DJ set was playing. I had a lot of things working in my favour going into the show, I knew a lot of people going from multiple social circles, which included the extremely attractive receptionist from my office and a group of her extremely hot friends (nothing to do here as they all have boyfriends but did prove valuable later). But nothing worked out quite as well as the moment I walked into the bar and saw the cute girl I completely blew it with back in university. 

A bit of background: this girl had a thing for me but I was beta in my behaviour and after many hours together studying in library I ended up in the friend-zone and she ended up with a boyfriend.

I walked up to her with zero hesitation and gave her a big hug. She responded well as we began to exchange the typical conversation of ""what have you been up to lately"". The difference this time was my frame, I started touching her right away, grabbing her elbows and shoulders and I emphasized all my points. My most bold move in this initial stage was when she asked if I was going to check my coat.  

*""Yep""*

And with that I grabbed her hand and led her through the crowd into the back of line. We started chatting some more and just as the conversation starts to dull that aforementioned receptionist and her merry band of hotties show up and all give me a hug (hello social proof). At this point my original girl takes off to find her friends and I tell her we will pick this up later. 

I'm going to fast forward to the end but overall the show was great. I was talking to multiple groups of people, having a ton of fun, and displaying a ton of energy.  

So now the show is winding down and people are starting to leave. I look over and see my original girl standing with a group of friends and it looks like they might be heading so I spring into action. I walk directly over to her and looking firmly into her soft eyes say. 

*""Give me your number""* 

*""Why do you want my number?""* (certainly a test to see if I would revert back to my former beta ways) 

*""Because I fucked this up when we were in university and I will not let that happen again""* 

Her jaw drops like a nine pound hammer, and eyes light up like the 4th of fucking July. She rapidly inputs all her contact info into my phone. I tell her that it was great seeing her and that I we are going out next week, and walk back to join my friends close to the stage. 

I stand there for maybe thirty seconds until I basically tackled from behind. I turn around and guess who, before I even have time to think she grabs me and pulls me in and we start to dance. At this point I get a bit nervous, I'm not a very good dancer and she is really into it. But then a message starts to ring in my head as loud a fucking bell. 

**She will forgive you for being too aggressive, but she won't forgive you for never making a move.**



I start ramping up the sexual touching almost to see how far I can go. At one point she stops me and pushes me back slightly and says.

*""Hey you are getting a bit aggressive there mister""*

*""I know""* pregnant pause *""and you don't want me to stop""* 

She flashes me an adorable little smirk, and turns around places her perfectly formed ass firmly into my crotch, as I give it an approving pat. Needless to say any bad taste in my mouth from my shitty date on Friday was long gone. 

Unfortunately I didn't get her home that night as her friends swooped her away shortly after that exchange but we have already set a yoga date for next week, and did I mention that the studio happens to me in my building (oops). 

In conclusion, I have to thank ThrowawayPUA for his words of wisdom, and I strongly suggest you heed them as well gentlemen.

1355271243.0,294,self.seduction,14p140,I just can't stop talking to people!!! (A personal anecdote about being more social),384,90,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14p140/i_just_cant_stop_talking_to_people_a_personal/,"Hey guys. Today feels like a great breakthrough for me, as I've been able to take a big stride forward in my life. I carry conversations with everyone I come in contact with now. And it keeps me feeling energized and happy all day. 

Recently, I've been trying to talk to more people when I'm out and about. But I implemented a perspective I learned from Sasha Daygame that has changed my life and the way I carry myself. That is:

**Be self-amused, always. When you're inside your own little bubble of fun, people will want to be in that bubble with you.**

Now, I walk around with a smile on my face, trying to keep myself from skipping down the halls when I'm in a mall, or clicking my heels when I'm walking down the street. And when you are having that much fun, you'll get that energy back from everyone you talk to! It's AMAZING to see a cashier's day be totally made just by you asking how they're doing.

Let me tell you about my 45 minute lunch break at the mall today:

I walk to the food court to get some Greek food. I see someone behind the counter that I see there all the time. I smile at him and say 

""Hey buddy! Good to see your face again! Hook me up with some Pork Souvlaki!"" 

He smiles and says ""you've got it my man!"" 

""Do you guys have an employee discount here?""

""Didn't you ask that yesterday?""

""Never hurts to ask! I'm gonna keep asking till the day I that 10% off!""

He laughs again and I'm on my way. I go to Booster Juice to get a smoothie. The man behind the counter seems to have a dull expression, but I act over-enthusiastic anyways. He offers me an extra booster in my drink. So I ask him about the ""Go girl booster"", and ask if I were to drink it if I would grow a set of tits. He laughed pretty hard.

After eating my meal, I walked around for a bit to buy some Christmas gifts. I walk into The Body Shop and was shopping around, asking one of the clerks how much the hand cream was. When she left, an HB7 came up from behind and asked how much she said the hand cream was. So I said ""$20. Hey, actually, wanna help me pick out a good scent for my step-mom?"" She said ""Sure!"" We stood around smelling the different creams for a few minutes, and then I got her talking for about another 5 or so minutes after, telling me about how she was going to Columbia in a few days, and talking about living apart from her family. It was amazing that a complete stranger would begin talking about family life after just five minutes of meeting! I probably could have #-closed then, but decided against it and told her to have an awesome trip.

I went into a specialty tea store after that. The girl behind the counter (HB8) had a Santa hat on when no one else did and was very energetic. We immediately connected. I said:

""Hey there! So listen, I'm looking to get a tea for my step-mom that would be perfect for her for when she finishes a meditation session.""

""Oh! I feel you on that one! Here let me show you a couple!""

""Right on! Do you do any meditation yourself?""

""No, but I do yoga, so I'm familiar with a lot of zen concepts.""

""Woah! That's awesome! You totally know what that enlightened mindset is like don't you? I meditate too, so it's cool to meet someone that knows what that's like!""

We chatted for about 10 minutes as she helped me pick out a tea. She was fucking COOL. And I think me being in that energetic and happy state of mind brought some more of that out in her. Didn't #-close because she was surrounded by her co-workers and didn't want to make it awkward for her. But if I see her again in the mall, I'm definitely getting those digits.

And that all happened in 45 minutes.

I think the most important thing here is that I really made a lifestyle change. Talking to everyone isn't something I actively think about anymore, it's just part of who I am. Even if none of this helped me pick up girls, I would still be so grateful for this new perspective. Because now I feel like I'm a fucking awesome person, and I never used to feel that way.

**LESSONS:**

* be a ""happy mirror"". Be positive and outgoing to everyone from the get-go, and they'll do the same.

* Amuse yourself as much as possible. You'll find others are amused as well.

* If someone is wearing a name tag, CALL THEM BY THEIR NAME. It builds instant rapport, because hardly anyone coming into the store actually calls them by their name.

* As soon as you decide that every single person is interesting in their own way, people will think you're an interesting person in your own way.

Everything went amazingly.,365,70,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/lnxgs/frmet_a_girl_who_i_shared_a_cab_with_everything/,"I'm in a town I've never been to. I had to go to FedEx and found myself standing at the stop light waiting to cross. This girl asked if I knew how to get a taxi and I said, ""Oh, I'm not from here."" I was going to just keep walking, but there was something there. I don't know, it must have been me eyeing her up and down. She's part Lebanese and Italian. She has Olive skin and green eyes. WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE. But instead of being a little bitch and just awkwardly walking away I introduced myself and then said, ""You know what? Follow me, I'll find us a Taxi. I need to get somewhere too."" 


I flagged down a taxi and we both got in. I made some jokes about both of us being foreigners to the city and then the guy who was driving us got upset because we got stuck in traffic, I said, ""Oh, don't worry about it man. I'm totally cool with being stuck in a car with a hot girl."" She shot me a smile and I said, ""Hey do you think I could convince you to go to dinner with me tonight?"" She was hesitant but then I said, ""What do you have to lose, really? I mean it's not like you have anything to actually do tonight, right?"" She said yes and we were on our way. I let her change in my hotel room and I got showered and she dressed UP and we went to dinner. I treated her, we talked, we moved from superficial things to talking about our families and our lives. I asked her to tell me a secret and she ended up doing so. I made fun of her for being so nervous around me. We had a really good back and forth energy. I would make fun of her and then talk about something. I asked her about herself, and then she asked about me. I joked that she was actually a con artist and that she was seducing me at dinner so her con artist friends could break into my room and steal all of my clothes. And when we went back to get her stuff, she was going to stab me in the back with a syringe and as I was falling asleep, she would kiss me and the last thing I would see is her saying goodbye. 


When we finished up at dinner she grabbed my hand and we walked up to my room. Everything was PERFECTLY set up. When we got inside she stood next to my bed and I said, ""Can we skip the part where you stab me in the neck with a syringe?"" she smiled and kissed me. I held her wrists in case she was a crazy murderess. But it turns out she wasn't. 


All of this JUST happened so excuse my rush. It was amazing and she is a really freaking awesome person. Thank you seddit. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 


Cliffnotes: Met a girl way out of my league, took her out, got past all the stupid awkward obstacles and ended up making out with her. She really really likes me. 

**UPDATES**


She texted me last night when she got home. I forgot to mention that she was about to rape me, but had a 2 hour drive home and work early in the morning. She was in town because she spent the weekend with her friends and had left her car in another town over. Her message to me last night when she got home was filled with, ""&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"" and ""Thank you so much. You are so fucking wonderful."" and other girly shit like that. She wants to fly out to my state to see things. I'm freaking floored. I have no idea how this girl who is easily a 9 on my scale would want me. I'm seriously just this dorky, nerdy Asian engineer who sits around playing videogames and shit all day long. She is half lebanese, half italian and has gigantic doe eyes that are green and a body that r/xsmall would murder me for. She's basically some idealistic version of what I pretend I deserve.

1348853422.0,294,self.seduction,10mlxb,Why Umbrellas are a useful seduction tool.,376,82,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/10mlxb/why_umbrellas_are_a_useful_seduction_tool/,"I live in London, and over here it rains like a motherfucker. So an umbrella is kind of a must. 

Recently, I've been through the process of overhauling my entire wardrobe, so a few weeks ago while shopping I saw a large Fulton umbrella that was sleek and expensive. Bought it. Boy oh boy do I **not** regret it.

Basically, it's the best seduction tool for a rainy city like mine. Just last night, when it started pouring out of nowhere I saw two girls in skirts and high heels start to panic and run trying to get out of the rain. I ran up between them and opened my umbrella, which was big enough to shelter the three of us easily. ""Let's get out of here!"" and we all ran towards the bus stop. We got there and it was all smiles and surprises, I offered them each a cigarette and we got talking, closed both their numbers before the cigarettes were out.

I've also used my umbrella when closed as a prop for a whole host of other things. For example, I've used it to sort of ""trap"" a girl into standing very close to my body, simply by holding it horizontally behind her, so that it was touching her ass. With an arm on each side and the umbrella behind her, she's got nowhere to go. I've also used the hook of my umbrella to playfully lift a girls shirt a bit (she was joking about how she had a six pack and I said ""oh yea?"" and slowly but surely started to lift her shirt using the handle. She playfully pushed it away but would that EVER have been possible to pull off with my hands ? Hell no !).

So umbrellas are a useful prop. And for that matter there are a bunch of other things too, scarves for instance which I've used in the same manner. Use them all to your advantage !

EDIT: A couple more things I didn't mention: it's far more appropriate to give a girl a playful slap on the ass with an umbrella than it is with your hand. Also, walking with those girls in the rain they were huddled real close to me, so it's great kino.

I enjoy listening to certain speeches again while I drive to really make sure they sink in.

Anyway, I went out to go to the bathroom and before I could go back in I was approached by a semi-attractive lady who offered me a drink. This never happens so I went for it **unaware that my phone was still in my pocket recording**. She paid and thanked me for accepting instead of countering with an offer to pay. Take that, /r/MensRights. We chatted over a drink and didn't really hit it off so we parted ways and I went back to finish my convention. No biggie. 

It wasn't until I was driving a couple days later listening to the lecture when I realized that I had secretly recorded this entire 20 minute conversation with this girl. My gut sank. I listened to it. Oh my God. Everyone is their own worst critic but it was pretty cringe-worthy, I did **not** come off nearly as aloof and confident as I had thought. Listening to yourself in this ""seduction mode"" from a third person perspective can teach you **A LOT**. For instance, I realized my *trying-to-be-sexy* voice is actually me talking far too gravely and mumbling over myself. It's not sexy at all, I sound like I'm drugged up on tylenol PM for Christ's sake.

This experience gave me some huge personal insight and pointed out some obvious things that I can work on, things that are so basic that I could not see without this vantage point. I thought I would share this technique.  Of course if you try this you'd best not be caught because it would be difficult to explain, I'd imagine. I'd love any thoughts.

I literally never have this problem and I'll tell you why.

I proudly own over 350 DVDs. You won't believe have many girls that collection has gotten into my bedroom. Not all of them were immediate f-closes, but it got the ball rolling. Every girl that I've brought over and said ""pick a movie, I like them all"" has found one she either really loved and water to watch or one she had wanted to see and never got to. I have stuff from action, horror, childrens, comedy, chic-flics, dramas, and live performances. I gotta say ""John Mayer Live in Los Angeles"" really gets all the girls pants wet.

The big plus to this is, most of the girls **ASK** to come back and watch more because there's such a variety. For crissake, I have more movies than Netflix, folks!

Now, I've been collecting DVDs for close to 10 years and I realize a lot of people dont have the want of money to buy a bunch of movies. However, download them, borrow them, get Netflix. Every girl likes watching a movie. It's a perfect time to initiate kino. It's a perfect time to look for IOIs. Its fun and easy entertainment. Like I said, most girls want to come back because they know how many fucking movies I have and there's more than one that they found they like or want to watch.

Try this out sometime if you can. See how it works. Cheap entertainment for both and its fun!

EDIT: I forgot to throw in that by bringing up my collection in casual conversation intrigues most girls and they say something along the lines of ""you should show me sometime!"" or ""Holy crap, lets watch one of them sometime."" Call it nerdy. Or whatever. But it works!

**EDIT:** I want to point out that I didn't start buying/collecting DVDs to ""pick up girls"", it just so happens I love movies and film and have noticed that having so many movies is a very good starting point to entice a girls interest and a good excuse to get her to come over.

A year or so into our marriage, things between my wife and me started to fizzle out sexually, and I didn't know why. I knew we were both still attracted to each other, but we had gotten into a roommate rut of just hanging out and kissing every now and then. And on the rare occasions that we would have sex, it was painful for her and therefore unenjoyable for both of us. The thing is, the other aspects of our relationship have always been amazing: we're extremely supportive of one another, have great communication, and sincerely love spending time with each other. Part of me felt like I was probably being a bad husband, another part thought it might be a result of the birth control she was on, but mostly I was just confused and frustrated.

Five years into our marriage, I noticed myself entertaining thoughts about pursuing other women. I've never come close to seriously considering cheating, but I could definitely see myself having gone down that road given five or ten more years. And I definitely didn't want to be that guy. I didn't know what to do. 

Then I came across [TofuTofu](http://www.reddit.com/user/TofuTofu)'s [Above the Game](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11ng7n/above_the_game_intro_my_story_preview_of_my/), and I devoured it, immediately putting it into practice with my wife. At first she wasn't sure how to handle my extra affection, but a week later we found ourselves having the best sex of our marriage (it would have been sooner had it not been for logistical reasons), and now we both know that we want each other, which is leading to more and more sex, with her seducing me again as well. 

Looking back, I saw that at the beginning of our relationship I had naturally seduced the hell out of her, but as time went on, I had stopped clearly communicating my desire for her and treating her in ways that she found attractive. Specifically, I had stopped maintaining eye contact, gradually escalating kino, and taking charge of setting up dates with her. As a result of all of this, I had let myself get friend zoned by my wife, and we both felt awful for it. 

Now though, things are back on track and better than ever. I mean, damn, there is nothing better than knowing without a doubt that the woman you love more than anything else in the world wants you, and wants you bad, and having her show it enthusiastically.

Some are for beginners, some are for more advanced guys.

Hope they help in some way.

**BEGINNER SHIT**

* **Most people who need game and learn about game eventually give up**. The overwhelming majority of those cases, they don't succeed because they put every obstacle they can find in front of what they need to do - tell them they need $20 dollars, and they'll fire back every reason they don't have it and can't get it. If you want to succeed, don't be one of these people. Every time you find ""a reason that something isn't working,"" that doesn't change a thing about what needs to be fixed - it just explains why it's broken.
* **This shit takes years.** It's not a spa day. It's not a weekend retreat. It's your life, and your choice as to how to live it.
* **Be friends with women.** Game is not about turning women into ""the enemy."" You may not learn game from women, but you learn about women from women. Also, life is about much more than getting laid, and the only way you can find that out is by having lots of sex - which means that if you're a beginner, you don't believe me.
* **That said, DO NOT TRY TO BE ""FRIENDS"" WITH A GIRL YOU FIND SEXUALLY ATTRACTIVE.** ""Sexually attractive"" here means a girl who you'd go out of your way to have sex with. Not simply a woman whom you'd shag given the opportunity (free sex!). You'd be lying to yourself every day you see a girl who you'd like to ask out but don't.
* **Theory is, by nature, easy to understand. That isn't where you fail.** You fail because you don't have your skin in the game. You haven't done your 1000 approaches. You haven't asking 1000 girls for their number. You haven't practiced what you need to practice. Sure, you know what you need to do. But, I can read and understand a Wikipedia article about building cars - I'll be pretty shitty at it until I get that 1000th car built.

**INTERMEDIATE SHIT**

* **Stop taking yourself and game so seriously.** This is about fun, remember? Have fun. Be fun. You've had enough approaches by this point to know that you can't win 'em all, so stop making it about your batting average. If you were smart, it never was about your batting average.
* **Be a leader, and stop waiting for one.** You spent your entire beginner career listening to other people tell you what to do. You may have gotten good at it. But, you still have that habit of thinking ""what would Vichet (or whoever) have me do?"" Cut it out. We're here to teach you to be your own leader. That means cutting the cord eventually. YOU decide when that is.
* **There is nothing new under the sun about game.** Times have changed, style might change, society might change, but the baseline of a man and women being in a room and being attracted to each other (or not) has always been the same. This shit has existed for thousands of years. It's only recently been formalized, but the point is that you have to assume that all the ingredients for you to carve out your lifestyle is there already. Stop looking for new answers for a situation that you think is unique to you. Figure it out, and use what you DO know.
* **Fix your emotional issues.** I'm fucking serious here. I've never met a guy who was frustrated enough at life to seek out this kind of advice who didn't have serious emotional issues - myself included. Fix that shit. You'll soon realize that these emotional issues were probably causing most of the problem that you've been band-aiding with game.

**ADVANCED SHIT (if you're already at this point, you know and have experienced this, too. These are just reminders)**

* **I've found that women and people are by and large a lot more willing to give generously than most people consciously realize.** This is the cornerstone on which society and the concepts of fairness and justice are built. Fairness is entrenched into the human psyche. Most beginners have a skewed concept of it, but you've risen above that. You have the power to both ask big things of people, and move on if they refuse.
* **If your self-esteem is high enough (it better be at this point), it's more constructive to look at every bad situation as something that you have a hand in fixing, even if it's unfixable.** A situation may genuinely be out of your hands. There may actually be nothing you can do. I'm not telling you to beat dead horses, or to keep running your head into a wall. But, there's an emotional and cognitive payoff for thinking that you can do something about a problem, even if you can't. [We're wired to find meaning, even in mindless tasks.](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_what_makes_us_feel_good_about_our_work.html) So, the thing you think is in your control, even if it isn't, will help you build positive thinking and problem solving skills, even if the real world result is failure.
* **If you have value to offer, your best weapon in the field is a smile, and a greeting.** ""Hello"" has opened more doors for me than any technique I've ever learned.

1372223280.0,292,self.seduction,1h38ub,FR: From Facebook add to F-close in two days,410,118,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1h38ub/fr_from_facebook_add_to_fclose_in_two_days/,"Hey, first self-post on r/seduction. But I think it's a good one.

Let me preface by saying that I'm pretty much your average guy. I'm 21, slept with 2 girls before, but I've never had a full time relationship. I have quite a few good friends, some of whom are girls. I haven't kissed a girl in over 9 months.

So here's how the story goes

One day I was browsing Facebook and stumbled upon a girl that I used to know in High School. I hadn't talked to her in over 4 years. Now here's the funny part. I had a HUGE crush on this girl back in High School, but I was so immature and deep in the friendzone I could barely see the light of day. I figured... what do I have to lose? So I added her. She added me back the next day and we started chatting. I didn't say anything too unexpected... just stuck to the basics. How she's been, what she's doing, etc. I ended the short conversation with something like ""Hey, great to talk to you again. We should go grab a drink sometime!"" and she seemed to approve of the gesture.

A couple days later, she texted me and asked ""Hey! So when are we gonna grab those drinks?"" I responded and asked her what she was doing tonight. She was free, so I invited her to go bowling. Told her I'd pick her up at 8:00. She said yes. So far so good!

Went to her house, knocked on the door (this is HUGE). Don't call from outside or wait for her to leave the house. Knocking on the door is a sign that you're confident enough to talk to whoever opens the door. Just so happens, her dad opens the door. I think I've talked to this guy like 2 times in my life, but I pulled it off with ease. Quickly re-introduced myself, and he asked a few questions about where I'm going to school, where I'm working, etc. It went great. So after that, my friend comes out and we drive off to the bowling alley. Things are going really well, we're basically just catching up on old news, talking about mutual friends, and joking around.

When we arrived at the bowling alley, I confidently walked up to the counter and asked for bowling for two. She took her money out but I turned it away saying ""Hey, no way, this date night is on me."" I think she liked that one.

So we start bowling, and I buy a pitcher of beer. The games were really fun. We started getting kinda flirtatious toward the end of game 2. Bowling is a great activity because you can show lots of emotion and give out some killer high-fives. Plus you get to drink while doing so. I actually showed off and bowled a game over 200 which was pretty sick. We ended up playing 4 games, all of which I think she totally enjoyed. 

After this, we spent about another 40 minutes at the bar. This is where I started making my intentions known. I asked her more personal questions about where she goes to school. Questions like ""So how's your love life in Colorado? Guys must be flocking to you!"" And she basically told me that her love life was nonexistent. This was the moment I realized I had a real shot. We were both having a lot of fun.

So we get in the car and start driving home. I play some pretty upbeat, fun music. We keep chatting, figuring out what our schedules are like. By this point, I'm realizing that she totally wants to hang out again. About halfway to her house, I ask her if she wants to stop by my place on the way home (because I live in a new house). She says sure!

We walk into the house, and I give her a nice comprehensive tour. The house is extremely nice, and I live alone, so it's perfectly ideal. A few minutes later, I pop open a bottle of wine and turn on the music. She takes a seat on the couch and I sit down next to her. We talk for a few minutes, and I started getting closer and closer. I tell her something like ""You're extremely pretty, even more beautiful than you were in High School."" And here we go.......

Kino initiated, and I go in for the kiss. We start making out on the couch, and the rest is history. She ended up spending the night in my bed. We're making plans to go to a movie later this week.

So here's my big 3 takeaways from this experience:

1. TIME CHANGES PEOPLE - just because someone didn't like you in the past, doesn't mean they won't be attracted to you now. In my case, I hadn't seen or talked to this girl in 4 years. People can change a lot in a short amount of time.

2. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? - just send her a text, shoot her an email, or add her on Facebook. Worst case, she responds uninterested.  Best case, she'll find it a nice gesture. Always end the conversation with offering to hang out sometime. This shows initiative and makes her know you're interested in spending some time together.

3. BE YOURSELF, AND DO SOMETHING YOU ENJOY. SHE'LL ENJOY IT TOO - personally, I love bowling. It's one of my favorite evening activities. Pretty inexpensive, and it's always a fun time. If you show her that you've got a plan in mind and are excited to do it, she'll feed on that energy and also be happy.

So that's it. Like it or hate it. I'm pretty proud of myself. It was an amazingly fun night. Can't wait for the next one.",Field Report,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,frflair,,True,t3_1h38ub,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1h38ub/fr_from_facebook_add_to_fclose_in_two_days/,

Made for an exciting night.,358,72,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/orqry/fr_gave_my_friend_160_he_would_give_me_back_20/,"Last night I tried a challenge that I read about in the PU book, Magic Bullets.

The challenge is to give a friend a large sum of money and then you receive some of that money back for each approach you do. This, of course, helps reduce approach anxiety.

I gave a friend of mine $160 with the understanding that he would repay me in increments of $20. That meant I had to do 8 approaches or F-close to get all of my money back.

We took the train into Manhattan and for the whole train ride I was nervous about it. 8 approaches… it seemed like a lot to me.

I only had some whiskey when I was back home and I would not be drinking anything at the bars for the sole purpose of keeping my mind clear.

The first approach was probably the hardest and the worst. The bar was a sausage fest and spare women were rare. I talked to some HB 7.243 at the first bar we went to. She had a bunch of empty glasses around her and I jokingly asked her if she had done all that by herself. The interaction was not good- I wasn’t sure what to say. At one point I asked her what her friend thought of something I said and she said that’s my sister as if I had done something wrong. I said fuck it and collected my first $20.

Then we went across the street to another bar. We sat down with our drinks. My friend had a jack and coke and I had, of course, a water. I used an observational opener with the 2 set, an 8 &amp; 6, next to me. There was a spinning werewolf mannequin and I said, “guys how awesome is this werewolf!?” I then made forced conversation. Not great. 

$40.

As we were leaving I stopped and talked to a group of three women at a table. I pretended to ask them for advice on good bars in the area (the East Village), even though I knew the area like the back of my hand. We then went on to have a nice conversation with them. I even got to try the Best Friends test, which I read about in The Game and Magic Bullets. I had a lot of fun using it and they seemed to like it, though at first they thought it was bullshit. It amazed me how prepared I was from reading the Magic Bullets’ model. They admitted to me that they were like thirty years old after I said they must be, “what 23?” which flattered them. I think they enjoyed the compliment but I guess I could have used more negs. Anyway, we talked to them for 15 minutes and then they left.

$60.

We left the bar and went to a different bar that I had been to before. I opened up a 2 set (8 &amp; 7.5) in the back near the band, which was on a break. I opened by asking them if the band was any good and if the place was good. We had a great conversation and the girls were so flirty. I got to use the best friend test again and it went over much better than before. Then I left for a moment to take a phone call while my friend stayed with them, on the way out I even found $10 on the ground. I came back and the 8’s BF was there with us. I played it off all cool and introduced myself, completely maintaining my equanimity. Then the 7.5 went to the bathroom and my other friend showed up and we excused ourselves to go meet him. 

$80.

I could have gone back to the 8 and 7.5 but they were an uncertainty and I had more money to make back. We left and went to a new bar. This place was awesome, very loungy and we got some chairs and a couch to call our base. We also met a guy having his bday and we got free cake! Nearby there was a group of women, no guys were approaching them so I did. There was a 5, 6, 6, 7, 7. I opened to the 5 and 6 and after a while they said they were going to the dance floor and invited me. I said I had to go talk to my friends and I’d be out to see them in a minute. 

$100.

I didn’t go to dance with the girls. I had more money to make back. I went with a friend to meet more girls. I opened a two set by introducing my friend with a line from How I Met Your Mother: “Hi, have youuuuuu met Dillon?” Then I got to talking to a 5, ugh. I wasn’t really in this one and I had begun getting tired from the previous approaches. However there was a good moment where she was like “you’re not doing too well with me” and without missing a beat I said smiling, “I love giving myself a challenge. I live for this.” I don’t know why but that calmed me down a lot. Still, I wasn’t gonna close and I didn’t want to. 

$120.

We left and went to the final bar, another place I had been to before. I opened one set with some chubby girl and her attractive Asian friend. It was nothing special, just a way for me to earn my $140. The interaction was pretty fast and I had developed a headache at the previous bar so I wanted to go home. 

$140.

One more left.

As I did with the previous 2 set, I approached another 2 set and opened with a Simple Pickup opener. “Hey you guys are absolutely adorable and I had to come meet you. I’m Red *shakes hands*.” It was Trisha (8) and Lisa (7.5). Trisha quickly introduced me to Lisa and she was druuuuunnkk. When I first met her she told me, “hold on I need to take a breath” and for the next 30 seconds she breathed in and out slowly. We started talking we actually had a lot in common. We were about to make out but I wanted to leave her wanting more so I told her I had to go see a friend in the other room for a moment and I’d be right back.

I quickly got a water and returned.

I came back and she was alone, my friends had kept her from talking to other guys. We started making out. Wow that was easy. I’ve kissed plenty of women but I’ve been drunk when I did it. Either she was a clumsy kisser or I had just grown bad (I used to be good), maybe a little of both, but it just didn’t feel fluid. She told me my hands were cold and started rubbing them and putting them up to her mouth. I thought she was actually going to start sucking on my fingers. “This is pretty cool,” I thought. 

But then it all went down hill. We kissed a few more times and I felt like it was bad and started to wonder if she thought it was bad too. This started ruining my confidence, which, up to that point had been pretty decent. I started to feel like a creep and I was getting more and more nervous. I wondered if her friends were judging me. I should have been able to manage my confidence but it started falling apart. I wanted to leave. And I did- I kissed her a few more times, got her number and left with one of my friends while the other stayed behind. 

And then the realization and regret started to set in. My friend told me she was so clearly DTF and he was right. Whatever bad confidence I started to develop, if I had just stayed with her I would have gotten to add a notch to my belt. But I didn’t. I got a bad make out with a hot girl but it felt empty. I could have gotten much more. Even now as I write this I’m pissed off at myself.

I should have gone back but I worried it would be awkward. Five minutes passed and I just texted her: 

This is a VIP #, store with care.
-Red

She hasn’t responded. Maybe I’ll text her soon. It’ll at least be good practice for my texting game.

Still, I should have f-closed.

$160.



***Critique***

**What I did right:**

I maintained a lot of the principles I’ve been reading about: strong eye contact, not leaning in to speak to somebody (which is awesome), false time constraints, kino (which I’m still improving), and keeping a confident posture.

I got to use the best friends test!

And of course I completed all 8/8 approaches. 


**What I did wrong:**

I should have tried to go past just the approach. When I’m drinking, I have no problem asking for numbers. But when I’m sober it feels like the chance of rejection is much more serious. I needed to, at the very least, #-close more. 
 
I viewed last night only as an opportunity to sarge. And that’s it. I never looked at it as going past approaching. I don’t know why but I was just in that faulty mindset.

I think I was also worried that if I spent all my time with one group or girl, I wouldn’t have time to make the rest of my money back.

I could have done better, and I plan to in the future.

I think this makes the kino sexual, but doesn't illicit her canned response for getting kissed), in about 3/4 of instances where I do something that escalates the interaction, she will look me in the eyes to see what game we are playing. Are we playing the chode ""I'm kind of nervous, but I'm going to bite you, and you might reject me, and I hope this work"" game? In that game, she is supposed to play the ""I am not attracted to you, I'll let you come on to me a little bit, but then I'll push you away"".


Or, she can see in my eyes ""I'm not doing this for the results. I'm doing this because it pumps my own state and I'm having fun. It doesn't matter if you reject me, because you're a girl, and I'm a guy, and I'll just keep going. Eventually you will fuck me, because you are a girl.

What's interesting is that subconsciously, girls know what these games are, and they know how to play them on cue.

Part 1: Speaking with Clarity.,349,66,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fpfp6/communicating_like_a_boss_part_1_speaking_with/,"I was asked by /u/SedditDisposable a few days ago to try to explain how I self taught myself to be a better speaker, and speech writer. This post is solely devoted to answering that request, and attempting to recreate the process, so you may be able to try this as well. This will be broken up into several parts for convenience sake. 

This is a tool that is intended to help you communicate better in future, whether it be a conversation, or a presentation. I also have self taught myself to write simple speeches that require ONLY prompts, and not verbatim transcripts. If this sounds like something that could help you, read on: 

&gt;**The What**

Human speech is the main way in which we communicate, and convey ourselves to other people around us. However, just because it is universally our primary medium for communication, it doesn't mean we're necessarily any good at it. Some people stammer, some people speak too quiet, too slow, too fast. The ideal clarity and speed to speak can be found with most News readers and news anchors.

&gt;**The How**

To be able to speak with clarity, and pace, I did the following things to improve:

**Speak to yourself**

Speak to yourself at full volume. Listen to yourself, and think if someone heard that, how much of it was conveyed, how much was difficult, and how much made sense? The great thing about speaking or reading to yourself is that you are able to instantly critique your pace, pronunciation, volume, and clarity, and redo it on the spot. 

**Record yourself**

So you just nailed the pace, and clarity, why do you have to record yourself now? The reason is because it's a different process that conveys different things to you. For example, you may learn that you actually mumble your words more than you think. You get to hear your voice as it actually is, and not how you hear it in your head. Listening to yourself may be excruciating, but it will teach you to stop ""uhh""ing and ""umm""ing. It also shows your nuances, so you may correct them accordingly. This will teach you how to speak with clarity, correct annunciation, and train you to remove thinking noises (uhh+Umm). 

I do not recommend you practice a speech in front of other people, because in this day and age, a lot of people have lost critical judgement of communication, or they're just a tad ADD while they sit there watching you fumble over yourself. If you know your subject, you should be able to critique your own words. 

Part 2 will come out whenever I write part 2.

I say ""I Know"" (thank you star wars), she says ' Call me' I say ' I dont have your number' she proceeds to scream her number and spelling it out with her fringers. I make no effort to write it down or remember it, not that I didn't care but I know I can do better now.. I ended up talking to another girl who was waiting with me about what I should text her. And got her number too. 

Life is very good when you don't give a fuck. You do what you love and it is amazing, especially when others do the same. I didn't go out to get numbers or to get laid, I did so because I wanted to enjoy MYSELF.

I don't want to go into detail about my experience because I personally don't like reading field reports and I don't want to give away too much info that might lead to who I am.


Basically this conference is in California, you stay at a hotel with about 1000 other people who all have similiar interests as you. Ages range from 19 to 70. I was in pick up mode the entire time. Getting as many numbers as I could and utilizing my time there as best as I could. I learned some game changing lessons and I would like to share them with you.


1) **Everybody wants to like you, they just need an excuse to.** This applies to males and females. Most people aren't going to discriminate against you for your physical appearance. They want to talk to interesting people and receive value from socialization. Be that person to them. Initiate the conversation, tell an interesting stroy, tell a joke, compiment etc. Realizing this shattered my concept of social hiearchies, even preppy sorority girls with their noses in the air will give you the time of day if you can make them smile.


2) **Be nice through your actions, not your words.** I was a chronic sufferer of nice guy syndrome. The king pin of AFCs. I couldn't understand why women didn't like me. I was such a nice guy willing to do anything for them. After approaching and talking to so many people at the conference I realized that people DO like nice guys. The key is that you have to be nice through your actions. Holding the door open, picking up something dropped, buying drinks etc. Just be kind with your actions and don't articulate it at all. As soon as you try to demonstrate your kindness through words you come across like you want something. Prove yourself through actions, not words.


3) **Everybody is an asshole.** Asshole is a relative term and everybody on earth has been one in some way at least a handful of times, including you. Never victimize yourself as a nice guy trapped in a world of assholes. Think about it and you should remember a time when you were a dick to somebody because you were having a bad day and didn't give a fuck.


4) **Build yourself a strong sense of reality.** I watched some of Tyler Durden's real social dynamics. He gave some good advice that finally clicked with me at the conference. He said that women find a strong sense of reality highly attractive. Just think about it. An attractive woman gets approached all the time by douche bags who just want to have sex with her and AFCs who want to be walked all over. Then you come into the equation. A man who isn't afraid to ride solo. You approach her and instead of trying to throw lines at her you are having a legitmately interesting conversation. You are confident and come off as a guy who knows what he wants in life. You seem completely free and the opposite of clingy which is exactly what women want.


But honestly, the best advice is this: **Make your life awesome.** All of these lessons will click with you naturally if you just try to make your life interesting and exciting. Don't take no for an answer, if you have something you want to do, DO IT. No matter the cost, you only have one life to live, minds well enjoy it.


Conclusion: Be kind through your actions, not your words other wise you will come off as fake and needy. Everybody wants to be friends you just have to make them feel comfortable giving you that value. Everybody is a dick so don't dwell on negative interactions and realize that even you can be a dick sometimes. Have a strong sense of reality and confidence, women will gravitate towards you when you don't need them to make your life awesome and exciting.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_m4vs0,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/m4vs0/just_returned_from_an_intense_7_day_conference/,
1294814820.0,282,self.seduction,f0qzw,8 Epiphanies That Changed My Game,362,80,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/f0qzw/8_epiphanies_that_changed_my_game/,"For 3 years I have kept a journal since I started in the community. I have just had my three year anniversary and I wanted to go back and read the things that I have written. Upon doing that I saw so many mistakes that I made and lessons that I learned. I want to sum them up from the perspective of someone who started off in a dark place to someone who now teaches. 

Before I get to my epiphanies I want to explain my journey. 

When I found the community I was going out 7 days a week living at home with my mother not working. I asked opinion openers in the mall and got blown out constantly. I was beginning to think that this stuff didn’t work. Out of desperation I reached out to a Mystery Method instructor named El Topo who much to my surprise connected with me on a personal level. He never asked for a dollar from me but gave me more then I could ever afford. He told me that I had to meet a guy from Boston that goes by the name of Doc Holliday. I talked with Doc on the phone that night and we hit it off. Our views were very much in line and we decided to hang. 

Doc got me into the  local lair and we sarged together. I saw another side of day game that was real, honest and VERY powerful. I continued to go out 7 days a week selling my video games and dvds to make money to get to Boston. Doc saw me improve very quickly and asked me to be the approach coach for Practical Pick Up. 
The group of Saffron, Entropy and Doc took me in and I learned so much from watching them teach and work with students. I watched as Saffron would approach girl after girl and just dominate their reality. Entropy was much more chill but produced the same results. I learned my first epiphany 

**Epiphany #1
There are two types of attraction; Passive (which is body language and looks) and Active (which is being fun, witty and playful) **

Saffron was like 5ft tall and not very attractive at all, Entropy is well.. lets just say better looking. However when they would go out it was not the better looking guy who got the girl. This blew my reality away! 

My job with Practical Pick Up taught me how to be a teacher. The guys invested a lot and out of a business grew a friendship. My game continued to grow and so did my passion for teaching. At one bootcamp I met a student who ended up giving me a ride home because he lived a couple of towns away. Jimmy quickly became someone who I admired. He is a father who is very active in his son’s life. Growing up I never had that experience but here was a guy who was divorced, successful in his occupation but still played a role as the father to his son. From him I learned responsibility for my actions and in turn I taught him what I knew about women. 

Jimmy quickly became a close friend to me and he became really good with women. This is a guy who was 10+ years the senior of most of the girls he was dating and they loved him. His playful style of game would only get better as time went on. 

At this time I started getting more girls in my life as I went out. I liked this one girl but couldn’t escape the friend zone. At her house one night she told me how she likes this guy. She then said something that became my next major epiphany:

HB: Just because I like him doesn’t mean I want to have sex with him. I can like lots of people but it doesn’t mean I want to fuck them or go out with them.

**Epiphany #2
I left the house that night and learned a very valuable lesson. Girls will fuck guys they don’t want to date and they will like guys they don’t want to fuck.**
 
At this point I decided to invest a ton of time into social circle game. I figured having a friend who was a girl could be a bad thing or good thing, its all on how I relate to it. I decided I needed more girls in my life I wasn’t gaming it was NOT healthy to game every girl. So I embarked on becoming the guy in clubs that everyone wanted to be. To do that I would need a social circle. 
 
I was doing good with the girls, getting laid and building a network but I still lived at home and had no job. I was out of video games to sell and I had my next major epiphany. While I was pulling girls, the quality of girls I wanted was not what I was getting. I would take 7s home and have sex but I felt empty. Then I learned it…

**Epiphany #3
No amount of game will make up for a shitty lifestyle. **

I had the perception of being this high valued guy but I was simply playing a part. I decided to stop all pick up for 3 months and get my shit together. During this time I fixed my life, bonded with friends and got a job. My lifestyle was getting better so now it was time to shake the 7s and learn how to pick up the hottest of the hot girls! In the mean time I decided to get back in the swing of things I was going to knock out some goals. One goal was pull a girl off a dating site from open to close in 1 day. This was actually a lot easier then I thought it would be thanks to Jimmy allowing me to use his house for operation fuck the online chick. After this was over the next day was ushered in by the next epiphany. I was feeling low and I couldn’t understand why. I just did something that took a great amount of comfort I thought so shouldn’t I be proud? I thought about the girls who rejected me in the past and then it hit me….

**Epiphany #4
Game is not about wracking up lays to take vengeance on women for your hurt in life. Game is about improving yourself that you can share your best self with a woman who deserves it. **


From this lesson I decided to only go for girls that I really liked. Wracking up lays was taking a toll on my morals and I felt like such a value taker. I wanted to leave people better then I found them and at this point I wasn’t doing that with everyone I met. 

The next epiphany came as I was talking to a friend. He asked me why I was blowing off these 7s and 8s who were obviously into me. I told him I have really high standards. Then it clicked….


**Epiphany #5
You can ONLY have high standards if you EARN THEM. **


Most guys talk about how they have high standards but they have NEVER been with a girl who was BEAUTIFUL AND high value. These drop dead hot ass girls that most guys say they want most guys have NEVER had. I was making excuses and really didn’t earn my high standards yet. 

So I went for the 8s and only the ones that I really had some sort of connection with. I left them better then I found them and then the 9s seemed to catch on. I began to write these experiences down and how I got good. I taught more and more and finally got the hang of picking up the hot girls. 

I went to Vegas to teach and came back on a high. I started teaching more and more and went to PA then to Canada to teach. Things finally made sense and were working. My job was steady and I moved out into my own place. The transition was tough but at the end of the first month I met a girl who would blow me away. 

I have been in relationships before but once in awhile you meet a girl that you have personal chemistry and sexual chemistry with. We fell hard for each other and rushed into things. This girl had the looks, the charm and the personality that was lethal for me. This became my next great epiphany. 

**Epiphany #6
Chemistry cannot be generated, you either have it with a person or you don’t. There are also two types: Personality Chemistry and Sexual Chemistry… If you have both you found something rare. **

Scarcity built up inside me as I couldn’t believe this was happening. I was afraid to mess it up and stayed in game mode. This threw me for a loop as this off again on again relationship took a toll on me. I stayed high value all the time and tried to impress her with my worth. This was a massive mistake and one that taught me a lot but cost me even more. This brought me to another very important epiphany when it comes to girls….

**Epiphany #7
The brighter you shine the bigger shadow you cast.**

For so long I was trying to display value to all these girls I came in contact with and I would spend so much time in attraction that I became unattainable in many ways. I learned that if you oversell yourself people are not going to buy. I was spending so much time doing attraction that I didn’t need to do at all and not enough time being an actual person. I fell into the common mistake that I had to look “cool.” Attraction became part of me once I fixed my lifestyle and really got my confidence in order that when I ran attraction on girls it would kill the interaction because they thought that I was just a player at that point. I learned that you can have too much value. This lead me to one of the hardest epiphanies that I have learned and cost me my relationship.

**Epiphany #8
When you don’t stop the game you are bound to lose. **

Jimmy became the teacher to me many times as his wealth of experience in relationships got me through this period of pain. Eventually I had to make a choice and get a resolution for me so I had to let go of the relationship with my girlfriend. I learned that pick up teaches you the “tricks” to getting the girl to go home with you but it doesn’t teach you how to keep her. All these game techniques never stopped when I started dating my dream girl and it cost me the relationship. This was a hard lesson but one that I have never had to repeat. 

There are so many stories, triumphs and failures along the path of the last three years that I could and might someday write books about it. For now I am proud of who I am. I came from a boy who didn’t know how to be a man to a man who is confidant and believes that everyone has value. I am blessed but know that the journey for me is not over. I am not and never will be perfect at this. I am a student, I am a teacher, and I am three years into a journey I began with the simple hope of creating social options. Now I sit here with a life that allows me to teach other people these skills. I am blessed 

Thanks for listening to my journey. I hope you find value in this.

Are you the guy that gets people to laugh all the time?

Who doesn't take himself, others, or everyday situations too seriously?

Who instantly diffuses tension when he enters a room, and gets people smiling again?

You, sir, have earned your negging license. Your sense of humor, combined with your baked-in confidence, allows you to **tease** people in a way that gets you INTO their confidence, and ONTO their good side, because you provide a valuable ""hey, let's lighten up"" atmosphere.

If you're like that, you probably started ""negging"" before anyone even told you what it was.

If, however, you're an underconfident newbie, and you try to neg, it'll only amount to you walking around and insulting people. Cut that shit out.

Consider how you would react to a person negging you. 

If he/she started out with jokes, got you to laugh and smile, and then started to tease you a bit, about something innocuous like your love of Pac Man, you'd probably be fine. **You'd be like ""this person has a sense of humor. The teasing is endearing.""**

If someone came out of the gate and insulted you... well, knowing r/seduction, you'd probably alpha the shit out of him. Or, more likely, post a question to seddit asking ""What's an alpha response to this asshole who made fun of Pac Man?""

Seriously. **Negs - shit, we can't even call it that anymore because too many people fuck it up - only work if you can be funny about it, and keep the person from actually feeling insulted.**

A neg should be a conversational poke in the ribs, not a sucker punch. All a neg should do is get you into a girl's **verbal comfort zone** - things she only talks about to people in her confidence - and tickle her a bit about it.

As with anything, don't overdo it.

**EDIT**

A ""neg"" should make someone feel MORE comfortable with you. Not less.

**Club Bitches**
[Full Post](http://datingamerican.blogspot.com/2012/04/club-bitches.html)


One of the best investments I've made over the past year is spending a lot of time, energy, and money becoming a VIP at a local city club. Becoming good friends with the bouncers, and eventually the owner can do wonders for picking up girls. I'll certainly be writing in the future about the exact process I took to basically ""buy"" a club, but for now I'll just say that I'm currently well connected.

One of the advantages I have when I'm at this club is that I have my main bouncer scour the club for potential hotties, and give them free VIP access at my booth.

A weekend ago I was down there on a Friday night with a relatively large party, so there was no room at my booth. The bouncer came over to me, pointed at a table down the way where two girls were standing. ""There's two ladies there just looking for guys to buy them a drink,"" he joked and gave me a wink.

I grabbed a friend and approached.

""I hear there are some ladies looking for some guys to buy drinks over here.""

""Yeah, that's us!"" A brunette answered.

""Excellent! We're looking for girls to buy us drinks! This could work out!"" I replied with a smile.

""Buy your own drinks!"" The second girl, a blond, replied with a look of disapproval.

""What are you talking about? We're pretty people, we don't buy drinks!"" I replied with a grimace.

""Are you gay? Why are you wearing a suit?"" The brunette responded. That's the best she had. As I've mentioned before I wear suits as a matter of course when I'm gaming. The bluntness of her statement was a disappointment.

To those who decry pick up artists and the seduction community, I say shame! We're bringing wit and humor back to conversation. Instead of worrying about us, you should worry about people like this! All she had up her sleeve was ""Are you gay?"" An incredibly disappointing lack of game coming from a girl who was trying her hardest to game.

Don't get me wrong, if there's a chance to have a genuine, humor-filled conversation, I'll jump at the chance. But instead you've got dolled-up bitches like this, trolling clubs, looking to take advantage of nice-guys' wallets and bruise a few egos before going home to remind themselves that lifetime told them they're princesses.

I went into battle mode. Why would these girls really act like this? Such poor attitudes, with the main motivation of shutting guys down. Explain to me why our culture has degraded to this sort of social interaction! In light of girls like this, it should be said that what I do is nothing short of a public service.

""Why am I wearing a suit?"" I repeated back. ""Why aren't you wearing a suit?""

The brunette looked at me with a disgusted look, ""what? I'm girl, that's why.""

I decided to pull out the first gun. ""Oh, you see, I'm a feminist,"" I began. ""I think women deserve equal rights and should be allowed to wear suits if they so choose!""

""Well... uh..."" She was dumbfounded. She couldn't say she wasn't a feminist. She stammered for a few seconds. ""Well I'm a feminist too!""

""Where's your suit then?"" I prodded.

The blond and my friend were sufficiently distracted in their own conversation at this point.

""Well I mean, I could if I wanted. I'm just wondering what the occasion is for you."" She replied, with less hostility.

""Oh, I just like to look good after work.""

""What do you do?"" She asked.

I went with my old standby job. ""I'm the garbage man.""

""What? No you aren't! You're lying to me!""

""Well now you're just insulting me! Are you saying that being a garbage man is so ridiculous that you instantly doubt my job?""

""Well.. uh.. no...""

""So garbage men can't put on suits and look fantastic after work?""

""No, I didn't mean that.. I'm just ... why did you come over here? We weren't even looking at you."" It was impossible to get her to laugh, and she decided that maybe she needed more bitch shield. Unbelievable.

""You weren't were you? Ah, I see, you were looking the other way?""

""Yeah, we were."" She said in a smug tone.

I looked past her in the direction she mentioned she was looking. There was one table with a lone guy. Not great looking. ""Oh, so you were checking him out? Come on, I think we both know you can do better.""

""What? No! I wasn't checking him out! You're crazy.""

""It's ok if you think he's attractive. I don't judge. I also don't put down garbage men."" I smiled.

Still, having a hard time getting much of a positive response. One thing was for certain, I had thrown her off her game.

""What is your end-game here? What do you think you're going to get talking to me?"" She sneered.

My god, I wonder if she has any friends! ""My end-game? What do you mean end game?""

""What do you think you're going to get out of coming over here?""

""Oh, honestly?"" I paused and smiled. ""Nothing. My date is over there,"" I pointed at a girl sitting elsewhere. Not actually my date, but a fun little white lie. ""I'm just distracting you so my friend can meet your friend.

""WHAT!?"" She gasped, looking genuinely surprised and hurt. ""I'm the DECOYYY? I'M THE UGLY DECOYYYY????""

""Ugly is a bit harsh.."" I replied.

""Oh my god, you are such an asshole."" She responded.

I decided this was a good exit. I had absolutely no intention of following through with a girl of such a bitchy caliber. I turned to walk away.. but stopped and leaned in to her for one last thing.

""I'm an asshole, sure. But you liked it.""

Then I walked away.

I later met up with my friend who recapped the girls' conversation after I left.

""He did to ME what WE DO to guys!"" She cried.

Heh. That's my favorite phrase. It's something I've heard a lot recently. Even in a more joking environment, I recently had a girl comment after a few minutes of flirting, ""oh my god, I can't get the best of you. No matter what I say, you always turn it around!""

Music to my ears. Girls acknowledging their game. It's like hearing a politician admit he lies.

Later that night I was on the dance floor when the two girls came up and started dancing on me hard. It wasn't sexy or in good fun, they were actually angry with me for harshing their buzz. I was astounded. Finally the blond pulled me aside.

""Why did you do that to my friend? She's really upset.""

""Do what?"" I asked innocently.

""You were a real asshole to her for no reason.""

""I don't agree. I was just striking up conversation, then you two started insulting me. That's just not nice.""

""Well the point is she's really upset.""

""Well, maybe she can take this lesson home with her. If she acts like a bitch, she's not exactly going to meet nice guys. That goes for you too.""

""Well I'm a bitch and I'm ok with it, but she's a nice girl! You shouldn't have been mean to her!""

""Then the best advice I have for you is to stop hanging out with her, you're starting to rub off on her.""

Her eyes grew wide in anger. I decided to back down just a little.

""Ok, I'll make a deal with you.""

""What's that?"" She asked.

""I'll be nice to the next girl I meet... if you two be nice to the next guys you meet.""

She looked at me, and I have to assume the irony of her accusations was sinking in.

I managed to be the only guy at the club that was able to captivate their attention the entire night. And I had to do so by being a jerk and getting negative attention. I suppose in some way I probably could've sealed the deal, but honestly, they were seriously bitchy and I had no interest.

I wish all girls could take this lesson home. Be nice to guys. We might just surprise you and be nice back.

So how do you go from a nice guy who gets stood up to a nice guy who gets laid? Well first I'd like you to ask yourself one thing.

""Am I only being nice as a means to achieve an end?""

You are not a ""Nice guy"" if you are only acting nice because you think it'll make a girl fall for you. Part of growing as a person is about meeting new people. Do you just throw a girl's number away when she says let's be friends? (I hate the term friendzone, it doesn't exist in my book) If a girl wants to be friends **BE FRIENDS WITH HER**. This doesn't mean meeting her every other day to bake brownies and paint her nails. Just be a good guy greg, you can be friendly and have a nice chat with a lady and not care that she doesn't want to have sex with you. 


Being friends with women can come with some great benefits. First of all you will have a good reputation with her friends, you show you aren't like other guys (DHV), you can gain invaluable insight from hearing their perspective on relationships, you can join groups a lot easier if you have a girl with you, you can practice flirting/gaming with no consequences if you fail, the list of benefits goes on.


Just because you're friends doesn't mean you can't flirt with her and use game on her either. This is why I say the friend zone doesn't exist, a girl might just ask to be friends because she's unsure of you. That's when you prove yourself to be a genuine guy who doesn't need to get laid to validate himself. I've worked my way out of ""the friendzone"" plenty of times. In my personal opinion I think the ""friendzone"" is where fake nice guys get put. The guys who use being nice as a front, the girl is saying ""lets be friends"" because she knows you're not really a nice guy and you'll stop chasing her if she says your just friends (would love a female opinion on this theory). Not to mention things change, maybe she was in a relationship at the time and as soon as she's out you'll be first on her radar. 

This all ties into the broader subjects of abundance mentality and outcome independence. You should be focused on fun and self improvement, not sex and validation. Also, come the fuck on, it never hurts to have more friends. The more friends, the more social outings available, the more people to meet, etc. 


TL;DR: Stop associating female friendship with failure, they can be the missing link in your game.

But it does remind me of missed opportunities.,331,53,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1ao6st/my_brain_never_reminds_me_of_any_rejections_but/,"We probably all experienced this. You go through a very embarrassing situation or a fuck up and for years to come your troll brain reminds you of that moment at random intervals which causes you to cringe for a second. Do you ever get that? You go about your day, feeling all happy and all of a sudden, troll brain!: ""Do you remember that time when you shit your pants on the bus? Just making sure you still do.""

I just realized something. I've been rejected numerous times. I've been told to fuck off. I've been pushed and asked to keep my fucking hands off. I've been rejected in front of people and so on. But the funniest thing I just realized is that it does not bother me at all. I'm completely at peace with this. I look back and feel no negative emotions. In fact, I laugh about it and share the stories with others. My brain does not troll me about those incidents. But do you know what it does constantly remind me about? All those missed opportunities. Things that I should have said or done but did not.

1356237886.0,280,self.seduction,15baf7,The Actual Rules of Alpha-Male.,353,73,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/15baf7/the_actual_rules_of_alphamale/,"I saw the post earlier about the 55 rules and skimmed over them. Some were fairly good, others were downright dumb.

The alpha-male of ancient times is dead. We live in the 21st century and the rules have changed:

1. RULES: ALL rules are simply guidelines, and I mean ALL rules. There will always be a situation where you can break the rule and come out on top. Understand the rules of the game before you play.

2. REPUTATION: Your reputation is as important at your persona. If people are trashing you behind your back (for whatever reason that might be) you will have a hard time seducing a woman who has already heard shit about you. I'm not talking about being a womaniser, that can be a real turn on for some. I'm talking about your reliability, courage, accomplishments, etc. Build a solid reputation, get people hearing good things about you BEFORE they've even met you, and the job is half done.

3. MORE REPUTATION: Follow through on your words with actions. I cannot stress this enough. If you are the kind of guy who says a lot and does fuck all, then get to the back of the line with everybody else. Men will respect your words if they know you mean them. Women will believe what you tell them if they know you don't bullshit. This is especially useful when making a compliment to a woman. 

4. PASSION: Nurture your passion. Mine is physics. I've cornered a girls before and launched into an explanation of why I chose it as a career, only for them to say ""Wow... you really love it. I can see it in your eyes when you talk about it... that's so cool."" That's a home run right there. What ever the fuck it is you love, show passion about it, and don't be all ""well, you know, it just my thing"" .....BULLSHIT!!! If you love it, she will see it.

5. OBSERVATION: Pay close attention to, but do not get involved in, the social dynamics of the group you are in. This applies both to your friends and to new groups you meet in bars. If there is a shy girl, don't go over like a bull in a china shop. Smile first, then approach; her mind will be racing by the time you do. If there is an extrovert, then engage with her, but don't stick to her. Alpha males know what is going on, but aren't involved. Knowing what is going on will help you in making the correct choices. If you get involved with out knowing the score, choices get made for you.

6. GENEROSITY: This is a tricky one to balance, but crucial. You Don't want to be labelled as a tight ass, but you you sure as shit don't want to be an easy touch. For example: buy a round of drinks every once in a while, but make sure everybody you buy for knows about it. DON'T say, ""this is from me"" and expect thanks... simply give them the drink and wish them good health, or whatever. It says you appreciate their friendship, but you don't need it. Alpha a fuck.

7. PHYSIQUE: This one is dead simple. Get fit, stay fit, shut the fuck up about it. Nobody wants to hear about your routine anymore than they want reminding that they don't have one. Unless you are talking to an aerobics instructor or some shit, just keep quiet about your fitness and relax in the confidence that when you get to fuck her, she will be impressed.

8. COMPETITION: This is the tough one. How do you deal with other people in your territory? The first thing you have to do is wake up and realise that you live in a modern civilisation and your territorial rights were relinquished a long time ago in favour of law and order. People are allowed to talk to the same woman that you are talking to and, at the end of the day, she is the one who has to choose. On the other hand, if you are doing things properly, you will also have many other women to choose from too.

9. EDUCATION: Educate yourself. Read that book you always said you would read. Watch a few documentaries. Try to never (never ever) be stuck for words about something. That doesn't mean 'always give your opinion.' Sometimes, the most respect you can give a person is to be quiet while they speak to you. It's impossible to know everything, but if you can connect the dots in a conversation you will always be part of it.

10. CONFIDENCE: Everybody has something to say about confidence. If you have followed the 9 guidelines above, how could you NOT feel confident? If you were a man who could play by the rules but knew when to break them, had all of his friends telling the world how great you are, knew what was going on around you, had a solid set of friends, good healthy body, and knew more about the world than those around you... WHY THE FUCK would you not be confident?

TL;DR You can't fake being alpha.

1355957301.0,281,self.seduction,154u5v,First Date Flake- A Guide on How to Proceed,361,80,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/154u5v/first_date_flake_a_guide_on_how_to_proceed/,"Definition:  A woman who cancels on your scheduled date.  Although flaking can occur anytime, for this guide I am going to focus on when a girl cancels on your FIRST date (meaning a time and a place have both been agreed upon by both parties) since this is the most common.  

**0-30 minutes before a date**

Scenario #1:  Stood up; no text, no phone call, no e-mail-  Biggest sin possible.  Your time is too valuable.  Never talk to this ~~she-devil~~ woman again.  NEVER.

Scenario #2:  Cancellation message sent, but no excuse or reschedule-  You're seriously considering trying to meet up withl this girl again?  NEVER.  NEXT.  No girl is allowed to treat us like that.

Scenario #3:  Cancellation message sent with VALID ~~(and confirmable)~~ excuse:  If the excuse is valid (see: death, car accident, shark attack) send a ""Hope everything is ok, I'll call you next week"" text and gauge her response.  Then follow up if you deem her worthy of your presence.  Bonus:  if she offers the reschedule for you, then you are good to go.

**31 minutes - 4 hours before date**

Scenario #1:  Cancellation message sent, but no excuse or reschedule- Wait.....  don't reply to her text for at least 20-30 minutes.  Let her mind race... ""Did he get the text?""  ""Did it not go through?""  ""Does he think the date is still on?""  Sometimes she will respond back with a couple of urgent texts (she may provide a valid excuse in her follow up texts).  At this point you can reengage based on her response or your own standards.  (personally, I would not allow her to cancel on me without a valid excuse).

Scenario #2:  Cancellation message sent with VALID excuse:  Proceed with caution.  Possible serial flake.  Allow her to flake ONCE, but that is all she gets.  Once again, it s best to wait 20-30 minutes to text her to to let her sweat a bit.  It is your judgment if you want to reengage 2 - 4 days later based on your standards (personally, I would allow it giving her the benefit of the doubt). 

Scenario #3:  Cancellation message sent with reschedule request:  Once again, allow her to flake ONCE, but that is all she gets.  Accept her reschedule time and work from there.

**4 hours - 24 hours before date**

Scenario #1:  Cancellation message sent, but no excuse or reschedule- You didn't build enough rapport/comfort with her when you # closed.  You can try to reengage in 2-4 days, but results will most likely be sub par.  Best to move on.

Scenario #2:  Cancellation message sent with VALID excuse:  She gave you ample time and a valid excuse.  It's fine, scheduling conflicts pop up now and then.  This is her one free pass.  Just don't let her do it to you again.  A text, ""NP, you owe me one.  I'll call you later this week to reschedule"" should do the trick.

Scenario #3:  Cancellation message sent with reschedule request:  It's fine.  Tease her, accept her reschedule time and work from there.  

**24+ before date** 

Scenario #1:  Cancellation message sent, but no excuse or reschedule- You didn't build enough rapport/comfort with her when you # closed.  You can try to reengage in 2-4 days, but results will most likely be sub par.  Best to move on.

Scenario #2:  Cancellation message sent with VALID excuse:  You be the judge.  It could be a lack of interest in the date or it could be an actual flake.  Look for context  clues in her message.  If it is a valid excuse, reschedule.  If it is a flimsy excuse, most likely you didn't build enough rapport/comfort with her when you # closed.  Put her on the back burner while you pursue other women.

Scenario #3:  Cancellation message sent with reschedule request:  It's fine.  Tease her, accept her reschedule time and work from there.  


**IMPORTANT!!!**  This is just a guide, not a 100% guaranteed sacred text.  There are always outliers and exceptions to the rule.  This guide should be helpful for the largest part of the bell-curve though.  The key is in the context of how she flakes.  Did she call?  Did she have a VALID excuse?  Did she attempt to reschedule?  What was the tone of the message?  Was it apologetic?  Did it really seem like she was sorry she had to cancel?  Did she respect your time?

In the end, the choice to pursue a girl who flakes is up to you and how much you respect yourself and your time.  The higher value you give yourself, the less likely you are to accept a flake or a flimsy excuse.

I will edit/amend this with help from you guys.  If there is anything you would change, let me know.

**EDIT 1:**  removed the word ""confirmable"" from the portions about her excuse.  As pointed out by rondeline- there is no need to ""confirm"" if her excuse was true or not.  Just go with your gut on it.  You make the judgement on whether it was valid or not and whether you would like to continue to pursue her.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1356021710.0,,,True,t3_154u5v,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/154u5v/first_date_flake_a_guide_on_how_to_proceed/,

Earlier this week I posted about getting a girls number by just being honest and real with her. Things didn't take flight, but that's not the point. The point is I tried and I'm learning.


I posted yesterday saying I was going out and would use some of the lines you guys suggested just to have some fun. 
The girl to guy ratio was slim pickings for the majority of the night, but I didn't care, I was still going to have an awesome time regardless. I would like to add that I'm not really into pick up lines or anything like that because of two reasons. 1. Most girls have heard the lines you're going to say and 2. I'd rather just be straight forward and tell a girl what I think. I've had way better results with this.
This was just for fun and to switch things up a little bit.

I approached this girl with ""Excuse me, can I ask you a really serious question?!"" A look of real seriousness came across her face as she replied with, ""Yeah, what is it?"" I followed up with, ""If I was a watermelon, would you spit out of swallow my seed?!"" She started dying laughing and said, ""Swallow"" and then winked. We talked for a little bit and I made my way around to meet some other people.

I didn't advance with this because I wasn't interested in her to begin with, but practice never hurts. It was a good ice breaker and I met someone new. +1

I saw another girl there and approached asking the same opening line, if I could ask her a real serious question. She said, ""Yeah whatsup?"" and I asked, ""What has 116 teeth and is holding back The Hulk?"" She looked completely puzzled and let out a nervous chuckle and said, ""I don't know, what?"" I replied with, ""My zipper!"" She laughed and smacked me on the arm and said, ""Oh my gosh, you're ridiculous"" Again, we talked a little bit and both enjoyed the rest of our night.

There were only two girls there throughout the night that I really would have wanted to advance anything with, but they were with two of my friends and I'm not a douche. I wasn't complaining, I still got tons of practice in and it was fun. I ended up going home telling myself I had one of the best nights of my life and I didn't get laid, take a girl home with me, or anything along those lines. I had a blast cause I didn't care and I was with my best friends and met some new people.


*Fast forward to this morning*


One of my friends wanted to take my out to Cracker Barrel for taking care of him a couple weekends back. I obviously wasn't opposed seeing be Cracker Barrel is fucking delicious.
He picked me up, we got there and when we walked in, I noticed the hostess was absolutely gorgeous.
Running game on someone while they're working (especially in that setting) isn't really ideal and I'd never done it before, but I said, ""You know what, fuck it, try new things!"" As we walked past her she said, ""Hey, how are you guys doing?!"" and my instincts just blurted out, ""Good, but better now that I've seen you!"" A **huge** smile stretched across her face as she blushed and walked away. We were seated, ordered our food, ate, and got ready to leave. My buddy stood in line to pay and I spotted the hostess again greeting people. I waited for a break when no one was walking in so she was standing all by her lonesome and approached. I walked up to her and asked, ""Is this all you have to do all day?"" She laughed and we started talking about how she just gets to stand out by the doors and greet people and get paid. She asked me where I went to school and, like I had imagined, we go to the same University (go figure).

After about 5 minutes I said, ""I don't want to keep you too long, especially since your job is so tiring, but give me your number and we can continue this some other time!"" I got her number and we left.


I'll probably see what she's doing tonight and see if she wants to go out with me and my friends. The last thing I thought I'd be doing at Cracker Barrel was running game, but it ended up going pretty well.


Don't be afraid to just have fun anywhere guys. Be light about it. Be genuine/real. Don't go out with the soul focus of getting girls or getting laid, go out with the intent to have fun and let stuff happen.

And this conduct you transfer it to the girls too. And it's a really big problem when you try to pick up girls, because when you start doing it your scumbag brain will start to make you nervous and you loose confidence.

Some examples:

When you start a conversation with a girl you are always thinking if she is enjoying the chat/been in to you or just being polite.

When you text her and you tend to over-analyze every word of the text.

When she cancels on a date, and you go on the entire day thinking WHY did she cancel?

I used to do this and it is painful, very time consuming and makes you loose your inner game and confidence.

I was doing this, i have beating the AA after sometime but when a girl showed interest i started to over-analyze everything.
So this little magic piece of advice that a friend gave me is this (in spanish) *""No pienses por ellas""* or **""Don't think for them""** you are not a mind reader just assume the girl likes you and go with the flow.

So simple but yet so powerful words when you start or rather you stop doing that, you focus all that brain power in just your inner game, and it shows to the girl that you are not a AFC on the contrary you are a guy that's confident of what he is and his wort.

No more AA do to you thinking ""will she think i'm a creep"" or ""what will she do if i do this"" NO MORE TRYING TO BE A MIND READER AND JUST DO YOUR THING.


SO with this mindset in me i when out the last couple of weeks with a much greater results, got 1 K/#-close and rejected (do to inconvenient circumstances) an F-close last night alone.


So what i feel is a good mantra for people that are getting back on the game like me, or people that are first timer is this.

Always assume attraction
Just focus on having a good time
And if a girl shows interest in you don't start to over analyze i repeat **DON'T THINK FOR THEM** and just go with the flow.

I hope this little mantra that has been doing wonders for me also helps you guys too.

And i'll be back with another very good advice from the same friend to build attraction with something that he calls ""The 3 dates game""

1303164993.0,274,self.seduction,gt3he,The Pussification of Men... The World According to Nice Guys.,378,104,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gt3he/the_pussification_of_men_the_world_according_to/,"I was never good with girls in high school. My friends had girlfriends and dates and I never went to prom. I hated the fact that I couldn’t be attractive like they were so I tried to become a carbon copy of my friends. I dressed like they dressed, talked like they talked and did the things they did. I ended up right back in the same situation, dateless and miserable. 


I figured my mom would have some understanding and so I reached out and asked her what girls want. She told me that they wanted a nice guy. Looking back at those words, they had a totally different meaning because my mother’s inability to articulate them caused years of frustration on my part. After several broken hearts and countless failed attempts I realized that women didn’t want “nice guys”, they wanted something different. 



The word nice has several meanings depending on the person and gender that you ask. For guys they often confuse nice with supplicating. See a Supplicator is a person who asks for things in a very humble manner. Supplicate comes from the latin supplicāre  meaning to beg on one's knees.  Begging for what you want is a sign of low self confidence and as we all know women are attracted to confidence. 


The word nice translates to pleasing, agreeable and delightful. All these words have positive connotations as opposed to the often confused supplicate. When a woman says she wants a nice guy she is talking about a guy who treats her with respect and is delightful to be around. 


**The major problem with “nice guys” is that they tend to lie to you the entire time. ** 
There is nothing nice about a guy who is playing a part to get something they want. This nice guy attitude may seem pleasant at first but often times nice guys have ulterior motives.  Nice guys will endure hours of whining and bitching about what assholes men are, all the while hiding their feelings for the girl. They lead women into a false confidence that they are there for them. They often shower them with affection; gifts and time expect a return without even verbalizing it. These nice guys prey on the emotions of women waiting for the one day where it becomes too much and they tell her that they are in love with her. The women, often blindsided does what any normal person would do and tells him they are just friends. The nice guys get angry, lash out and often take vengeance on the unsuspecting women. 


**The nice guy is an illusion that is masked with insecurity, shame and fear.** 
Granted there are guys who want to be friends with a girl but far too often guys use this ploy to be able to “get the girl.” They have an idea in their mind that if they get close to her after awhile she will wake up and figure out she is in love with them.  Afraid to tell the girl their true feelings they mask their intent and create a façade of misplaced chivalry that would make the knights of Camelot applaud. 


It’s time to face reality and learn an important lesson. You will never get what you want in life if you don’t ask. Masking your intent only leads to self deception and sorrow. Guys, I get it though. You don’t want to risk losing the girl because you told her you like her but the reality is hiding your intent makes you a liar and trust is amongst the most important characteristics a woman looks for in a relationship. 
Nice guys have many characteristics about them that are ingrained into who they are. Nice guys tend to:


**Seek the approval of others**

**Hold back their true feelings**

**Become uncomfortable when others express strong feelings**

**Give more then they get from people**

**Avoid conflict **

**Don’t like confrontation. **




These are just some of the characteristics of a “Nice Guy” but don’t worry there is hope! Once you recognize this behavior in your own life you can begin to change it. Often time people go to the extreme to change their nice guy behavior and start become jerks to everyone around them. This behavior is also quite destructive and will lead to more frustration on your part. Start by asking for things that you actually want. It’s often said that if you don’t ask the answer is no. You have to face the fact that things will not always go your way when you ask but if you don’t ask the answer will always be no. 
Being a self deceiving “nice guy” is manipulative in every way.  The nice guy flies under the radar because his misguided attention and support seems so genuine. When the person finally shows their true intent it’s often destructive to the friendship. Guys, if you want to get the girl you have to risk losing her. You have to put your pride on the line and admit your feelings even if that means the answer is no. If you don’t then you will lose more than your chance, you will lose a friend as well.

I've noticed a lot of people dismiss Facebook. Their reasons are usually pretty thin.

I get it, social media can be annoying... But if you're not using Facebook to keep connections alive, you're really missing out. **There is NO BETTER METHOD for maintaining attraction over spans of time where you won't see each other.**

In the business world, they call it [drip marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_marketing). A steady stream of ""touches"" between you and a prospective customer.

As you go out and meet people, you're invariably going to collect a bunch of random phone numbers and contacts. Add them on Facebook right away!

That cute model you met but couldn't pick up? Add her!

That cool guy you met who bought a round of drinks? Add him!

Add them all! You can always remove them later if you need to.

Then just post things on Facebook from time to time. Be generous with your likes. Wish people Happy Birthday. And send the occasional, ""Hey, how's it going?"" wall post. (Small gestures to show you actually care about the other person go a LONG way.)

**""MEMORIES BECOME IDEALIZED OVER TIME""**

I don't know what the psychological phenomenon is called, but we all have a tendency to romanticize and idealize memories over time. It's the reason you can run into that crush of yours from 8th grade and instantly feel a deep attraction to her, even if she lost some of her beauty over the years.

As you go out and meet people, you're going to have a ton of fun adventures. These are moments that will either be lost in the sands of time, OR, will grow to mythical status in their minds. **The difference is whether or not they are brought back to that moment by seeing your name &amp; picture on Facebook posts.**

It is a low-effort, potentially high-reward way to keep all those connections alive over time. 

People who utilize Facebook properly have free couches to crash on in different cities, access to a large pool of people to invite out, and possess thriving social lives.

So don't ignore Facebook, guys. You're doing yourself a disservice if you do.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1370193582.0,,,True,t3_1fitbh,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fitbh/dont_ignore_facebook/,

And not really in the field either, as it's just from Facebook. But, I thought it was a nice example of what to do/not do, so I'm sharing.

Undergrad girl from class I've talked to only once or twice in person, but a few times on Facebook. Haven't been stalling on talking to her in person, she just doesn't get to class early enough to talk to, and I'm usually talking to my friends from class afterwards, so there just wasn't really much opportunity. Thus, Facebook. I'm not a big fan of using Facebook, as it too often serves as a replacement for face-to-face interactions, rather than a supplement. But, there we have it.

I asked her to meet me for coffee tomorrow (today now), and she responded with being busy with writing papers, studying for exams, etc.

Then she followed up by asking if I had intended my question as a date, or just hanging out as friends. I said date.

Now here comes the make or break moment. She says that she's taking a break from dating right not, but it'd be okay just to go hangout as friends. Who hasn't been there before?

Beta Answer: Sure! OMG! I'm so hardup for any interactions with girls that I'll hang out with you under any circumstances! Plus, I'm secretly thinking of this as a date in my head anyways, and hoping you change your mind about it.

Actual Answer: It can't just be as friends, because that cat's already out of the bag.

Her response: Okay, forget I said that stuff about taking a break from dating. Let's go out tomorrow.

Not anything else to report, as we're not going out for another 9+ hours, but there you go. It's important to remember that when expressing your intentions with a girl, honesty is always the best policy. If you lie, girls are going to see right through you, and now you're going to look like a lying asshole who's trying to manipulate/trick a girl into liking him, instead of a man who isn't afraid of being a man.

If I got a number, we'd text constantly, but never really move anywhere. I would make pointless chit-chat because I was looking for the validation of her attention. I would torment myself if she wasn't responding. After discovering seddit, I've done a complete 180 when it comes to texting. I don't argue that you can't use texting to your advantage and build sexual tension, but I prefer to keep texting light and to the point, then let the face-to-face interaction do the real work. 

Some background info: I contacted a girl in my city on OKC (I live abroad so options are limited, but she's really cute), we exchanged a couple very brief messages, sometimes three days between messages, but we set up a dinner date for last Monday. It went fairly well, but I could tell she was being very aloof and coy. My first text to her after Monday was on Thursday. I suggested drinks Friday, but she was going out of town. The rest of the convo is here:

Me (2:37 PM): what's your schedule like next week?

Her (2:38 PM) I usually finish work at 4 

Me (2:44 PM): How about a monday dinner? know any good places?

Her (2:50 PM): mondays are usually my least favorite day **Lame excuse**

Me (2:51 PM): you and everybody else. I could cheer you up, but if you're really gonna be a downer... **Lame excuse texts get teased**

Her (2:52 PM): also, would you still want to go if we went as just friends? **Big shit test**

Me (4:26 PM): wow dropping ultimatums already. risky business **A fair recovery if I say so**

Her (4:35 PM): I just don't want to hurt your feelings later on =D

Me (6:07 PM): its cute that you're looking out for me, but I don't bruise that easily

Her (6:12 PM): good to know **Felt like texting further would've come off as clingy and validation seeking, cut it off**

**Saturday**

Her (11:09 PM): hey anything going on downtown tonight? **Unsolicited first text on a weekend, seems like a pretty good IOI**

Me (11:12 PM): out of town **I was out clubbing in Seoul, she got a response, but I had much more important things on my mind, ended up F-closing a girl that night**

**Sunday**

Me (12:49 PM): dinner tuesday at  7?

Her (1:13 PM): not unless you want to come to *her neighborhood* **Feels like another shit test, but I'm willing to roll with it**

Me (1:18 PM): there any good places to eat there?

Her (1:25 PM): all food tastes good if you're hungry. I'm sure its the same everywhere

Me (1:48 PM): i'll pencil you in. as long as it doesn't rain I'll drive out there. (driving a scooter in the rain to a date is a bad look) ill text you tuesday **I've got the date, no real need for any more interaction, cut it off**

I know it's a bit long, but it's got some key things that I think are worth looking at there. The biggest was the ""just friends"" speed bump. It caught me off guard, and I wasn't sure how to respond, at first. My old habit would have been to play it off and agree to just be friends just because I wanted to continue seeing her, and hopefully be able to win her over by being such a ""nice guy"". I didn't want to just outright say no to friends either, so I found a rather elegant way to just avoid the question.

As far as the timing of my responses, I generally respond quickly when she responds quickly, but when she takes awhile, I wait as well. Always texting back quickly makes you seem like you have nothing going on. Particularly with the ""just friends"" shit test, I was at work, so I was actually busy and not thinking about texting her. Texting a girl should *never* take priority over anything happening in your day-to-day life. Fit it into your downtime. I don't take my phone to the gym, and I rarely text at work, usually only on my lunch hour or sometimes during a short break. 

Other than that, I just did my best to match her attitude. We seemed to click well on the date, but for whatever reason, she is trying to act like she's not that into me, so I'm playing it equally coy and aloof.

I know even you confident guys can relate to going out and the first hour or two, just not being entirely comfortable or in the zone until you make so many approaches/drink enough that you just don't care. To speed this process I make a point to make a couple rounds and when I see a HB I walk right up to her and say something along the lines of:  
""Hi, I'm _______. You are?
After she tells me her name 
I then stare directly in to her eyes and say ""HER NAME, Your're beautiful. don't ever change.
Pause. Then walk away. This works for me, because I don't give her a chance, to reject me even though its almost always a positive response.  I walk up to them not trying to pick them up, but knowing I'm going only going to be standing there for 10 seconds and walking away. Plus, when I run into them an hour later, they will always remember me and it's fairly easy to strike up a conversation. For me its the equivalent of stretching before I work out.

This also works great around closing time for singling out the girls who are looking to get lucky. If you throw that out there and they are trying to go home with a guy, you will get VERY strong IOI.

The words of an older man.,373,95,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gqg3p/the_dangers_of_the_game_in_untrained_hands_the/,"To all you youngins out there who don't know the power of the game. Read this. I assume that many MANY people on this reddit are like me. Young, college aged men who have never even held a woman's hands. You probably have had some family issues. You probably are a nice guy. You probably have a heart of gold. Unfortunately, you probably will latch on to the first woman who gives attention to you, as it has been lacking your entire life. 

I know. It happened to me. Before I learned the techniques of the game I never had any confidence to capitalize on the attention from women. I lusted for a woman's touch. Someone to comfort me. Someone to be with me. Unfortunately, the results of my first target ended up just like that man from ""The Game."" I forget his name, but i remember what he said very clearly. Mystery said to his friend ""how are you doing."" And he replied, ""I am married and I have two children with a woman who I love, but she does not love me back."" Sadly, I am in this situation. I am now married to the first pretty little thing that I had the confidence to approach and now have a child with her. This, on its own, would not be a bad thing if she was a good person, but like Mystery's friend, she does not love me back. I sacrificed my youth because I did not know when to let go.

I constantly read all about picking up women, but I never see ANYTHING about when it is time to cut her loose. We learn one part of the game, but neglect the most important aspect, the strength to know when to let the fuck go. This stuff is powerful POWERFUL information. It WILL get you women if you keep trying, but without the knowledge and STRENGTH to know when to let go, you are setting yourself up for something MUCH worse than a life alone. You are setting yourself up for a life of depression and agony with a woman who does not truly love you. Know this foreveralones. If you did it once you CAN and WILL do it again. If you ever get the feeling that your woman does not love you, cut those ties immediately. Realize that the loneliness of breaking up is better than the loneliness of a life with her.

TL;DR: Learn when it is time to break up BEFORE trying to pick up women. You need to know BOTH aspects of the game before you begin.

It's all the wisdom I've acquired from the seduction community/resources, digested, and deemed important enough to carry in my head during a date (date != pickup). It's field tested and refined each and every date I go on. Thought you guys may find it useful.


1) Assume she is attracted to you. If you follow other dating rules/etiquette, there is never a downside.

2) You make all decisions. You may ask her opinion whenever you like, and oblige her if you like. She never feels required to decide anything. Take it as far as being prepared to suggest what she orders, if she delays.

3) Treat her like an equal. She is not better than you, she is not beneath you. Even if you like her a lot, or hate her. This also means she must treat you like an equal. Defend your boundaries quickly, clearly and fairly.

4) If you do something nice or chivalrous, it is because you choose to. You do not have to hold doors, pay, or bring the car around for her. Knowing this intellectually isn’t enough. Practice not doing these things so when you choose to do them, you truly know it’s not out of obligation. The act then becomes genuine, and she’ll be able to tell.

5) Be genuine. Don’t be thinking about game (important, but should be natural/reflexive), or what you’re going to say next. Take a real interest in her and try and relate. Let her talk plenty.

6) Don’t go out of your way to impress her. If you’ve got a lot of impressive things you want to tell her, let them be a cool secret that you can smile at to yourself, knowing you’re even cooler than she thinks you are. If they are conversationally appropriate mention them in a modest fashion. Or don't.

7) KINO ESCALATION LADDER Remember when I said not to think about game? This is the one thing you’re allowed to remind yourself of over and over. It is fun for both of you. Don’t be afraid.

8) Spread your attention - You’re on a date, sharing an event together. Don’t spend all night focused on her. It’s weird. Have fun where you’re at, talk to some other people, check some things out. Enjoy the event.

9) Make fun. This includes a lot. An exercise left to the reader.

10) Smile + Eye contact

Here is the original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/r381m/advice_from_an_experienced_natural_68_year_old/ .  I apologize for the wall of text, but part of this is written for myself so that I don't forget what he told me.

**A Yes-Yes Relationship**:  

If you are lucky, you have a mother, father, or both who are always there for you, and who you are always there for.  The relationships you have with your closest family members are some of the most precious things in the world.  With your mom, it doesn't matter if she was the one who called you last.  It doesn't matter if she paid for dinner.  It doesn't matter if you haven't heard from her in a long time.  You can pick up the phone and you don't even think about the possibility that she might ditch you.  There is no tit-for-tat in the closest, dearest relationships you have in your life.  This yes-yes relationship is what you need to build if you want your relationship to be full of fun and love.

**A Yes-No Relationship**:  
Most relationships you have are yes-no relationships.  Not just with romantic partners, but with friends, coworkers, etc.  Yes-No means you have to give something to get something.  You have to give money to get the gardner to mow your lawn.  You have to invite people to your party in order to get them to invite you to theirs.  You have to sacrifice something in order for them to sacrifice something.  You count the number of times she calls you to see if it is equal to or above the number of times you call her.  She'll only give you sex if you do XYZ.  You have to buy her dinner, take her on dates, etc. to make her happy.  You have to be together on every trip all the time, because you get nervous when she's not with you, don't trust her love for you, are co-dependent, etc.  The friends and family who would never hesitate to help you in times of need are generally yes-yes friends.  


**Building a Yes-Yes relationship**:

If you got seriously injured, and had to spend a lot of time in the hospital, would your mom drop everything and come to help you?  If she was truly an awesome mom, she would.  What about your friends?  What about your girlfriend?  Wife?  People who are in Yes-No marriages are the ones who end up unhappy in the long-run and ditch the relationship when things aren't fine and dandy, they find someone better, or aren't willing to put up with it anymore.  He told me, that the more experienced a woman is, the better she is at knowing who is capable of being a yes-yes guy.  Less experienced younger women need to be shown this in a more gradual way, because they haven't been frustrated enough yet by all the yes-no guys out there.  

What you have to do is work on yourself, and show you are a yes-yes capable person.  You can't control anyone but yourself.  If you want your life and the world to change, change yourself.  If it's meant to happen, it will happen, and you have to be okay with things not working out.  Love keeps on growing in a yes-yes relationship, but maintaining this let-go attitude gets even harder as the years go by.  He said that maintaining this attitude is the hardest thing he's ever had to do and it gets even harder as every year passes by.

Here are a list of things he's said to me in a somewhat random order regarding working on yourself:
Be aware of your emotions, and also being in control of them.  If someone is angry at you, don't just get angry back at them.  Figure out why the person is angry, determine if you did something to cause it, and apologize/make up for it if you're at fault.  If the person is just being a bitch, don't react and add fuel to the fire.  Stay calm, and let the negativity wear itself out.  It takes two people to fight.  Know what you want in life and don't allow anyone to stop you from getting it.  Enjoy the ride to getting it, otherwise you'll waste your life.

**Final Words**:

All relationships start out as yes-no.  A woman won't trust you yet the way she trusts her parents until a long time.  She WILL try to see if she can get stuff out of you and see if you are a yes-no guy.  This is part of being a woman, to see if the man she is with, is a man, or just a boy.  If you show her that you are willing to be spineless to her wishes, react emotionally when something comes up, etc., she will keep pushing you towards the yes-no relationship.  Some women are perfectly happy being in a yes-no relationship, where they act like a bitch calling all the shots, and the guy is a puppy dog.  This happens the other way as well, with the woman being pushed around.  There are, however, many women who crave pure, unbridled love.  The women who want a yes-yes relationship with a yes-yes man.  The problem, is that, they're a rare breed.  Women want to settle with men, not boys.  They end up settling with boys, because they can't find a man, and a lot of them don't live as happily as they wish they could.

I think pickup is more than just meeting girls, it's about improving your life and social skills as a whole. so remember, talk to everyone you see and just be a value offering person, you shouldn't feel like you have to turn on or turn off your sociable personality, it should just be you.

It's learning to be social, learning to master one of the most fundamental parts of our species' survival: the social, and sexual, atmosphere. 

That being said I've studied my ass off. **kino kino kino** ASSUME ATTRACTION! AND ESCALATE! 

The conversations here? people have made it clear that it is not a problem. I guess I just have a hard time rationalizing that someone can respond to me positively when my face is so different. It's a total ME problem and I recognize that. I know women when they get to know me don't see it as a problem but in the context of pick up? It is the one thing that stops me from going all in.

So I have recognized that this limiting belief is there. And that it must be challenged. That being said I ask seddit not only ""is it true that despite the way I look I can still be a decent PUA?""

1339986689.0,271,self.seduction,v7e92,[FR] 2 F-Closes this weekend,323,52,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/v7e92/fr_2_fcloses_this_weekend/,"This is my first FR and I am by all means still a beginner although I've had some solid learning field experience from trial and error and like minded friends with varying degrees of expertise. I apologize in advance for the FR being so lengthy but I wanted to provide as much of the details that were important and led to the F-Close.

Over last week and a half or so I had 3 lays, and 1 almost F-close. Of the 3 lays, 1 was off of OKC, the other girl during a hang out with some friends but I had met her once or twice before (altho never tried anything with her) and my ex. I didn't give myself any credit for my ex of course (she had reached out to me, but coming into this weekend I had a strong level of confidence that helped ""put me in state.""

I'll skip the first F-close from Friday and just get to Saturday to avoid writing too much. I walked outside the bar to grab a smoke and I saw a cute girl and smiled and said ""hey how are you?"". She was friendly and smiled back like any normal person would but I proceeded to fuck with her for a bit and said casually ""it's been a while, how've you been?""

""Sorry, we've met before?""

""Haha, funny. Seriously, it's been a couple of months, what's new with you?""

""Wait, do you know my name?""

""Common, we dated for about a week, did you really forget me?""

A couple of more back and forth until she seemed really mind fucked and I told her I was joking. She hit me and screamed ""YOU LITTLE SHIT!"" I was gold. She said that she's usually not that gullible and she's smart so I played with her the 5 lies game, betting loser buys winner a beer. Beat her at it, and again she hit me and shouted. I knew I had put her in the position to qualify herself and she enjoyed being challenged. All night I was pushing and pulling with her.

I took her to the bar to get me my beer and applied kino immediately. She seemed competitive so I challenged her at thumb war, best of five, to keep the natural kino flowing as subtly as possible. She was with some friends so I did my best to be friendly with them and my buddy (who is experienced in the field) was with me as well and he was making progress with her friend. I pulled away and talked to my friend from time to time so that I wouldn't make her the center of my night, at least not that early on. 

Fast forward a couple of hours and this bar is closing soon. She's not from this neighborhood and her friends are from out of town so they entrust me and my friend (also my roommate) to show them somewhere they could still dance and grab a drink. It was almost 4am so places were closing. We suggested our patio but some of the group had resistance so that failed. My friend had to leave to take care of something so I had to juggle a bit too much. I took them to this bar but the music stopped and they stopped serving. 5 minutes later and I round up the troops and tell them it's getting late.

My target wanted to go to the subway. The train was close to my place and her friends were going in a separate direction. I desperately needed this isolation and since my friend had to leave me to shepherd this herd solo, this development was key. I suggested to her again while we were walking to come by for a drink on my patio. She was really into me but was against the idea and said her friends would kill her. We keep walking to the subway and when we are passing my stoop I grab her hand and tell her nicely, 'one drink won't kill you, the weather is wonderful' and we headed into my building. 

On the patio I was trying to take kino to the next level but she had a strong guard up. I did the photo booth thing on my laptop where we take a series of consecutive flicks, 1 overly serious, 1 goofy, 1 pretending to make out and one normal. It brought down her guard a little bit but not the way I wanted. She kept saying how she has to leave after this beer. I play the cube on her, helps a bit. We're talking about all sorts of things while outside but I didn't want to keep my mind of the prize. I try this one exercise, cannot recall where I derived this from. It can be a little awkward, especially when completely sober, but it helps. I tell her you're still a little shy so I want to bring us a bit closer. The exercise, and I tell her it's going to be slightly awkward but it's worth it if we can get through it, is simple:

""Cover your left eye and I'll cover mine. Stare with your right eye into mine. We need to do this for 30 seconds. This is not a starting competition so you can blink, the point is to be silent and try to read each other's souls. We'll hold hands with our free hands while doing this to try to connect through body energy"" If you say this confidently they'll comply right away and assume you know what you're doing. Really try to stare into their soul. It helped immensely.

I tell her it's getting a bit chilly, let's carry this conversation indoors. My roommate was sleeping on the living room couch. I give him our code for get the fuck out of here now because I have a chick with me and need us to be alone (if you have a roommate, I suggest you make your own secret word). He was way too out of it and didn't respond. I tell her I don't want to wake him up so let's just chat in my room. Although I could've tried to bring it to my room immediately, in certain cases, such as this when the girl doesn't seem so comfortable with the idea of coming home with you in the first place on the the first time you meet them, making yourself seem like you're not trying to rush things to your bedroom prevents them from putting up higher walls and builds a level of trust. In my room I try to kiss her but she doesn't let me make out with her right away so I kept talking to her for a bit. Lot's of chemistry. It's 5AM and I tell her it's way too late right now. ""You're in luck. I'm out of condoms so I can't sleep with you, and I'm going to let you sleep here because it's way too late to take the subway."" Again, that helped make her feel comfortable. She didn't say no, didn't say yes, trying to debate it while talking to me and I throw at her gently a pair of clean gym shorts and tell to put this on while I brush my teeth and pass out. She sarcastically says, wow I like how you've made the decisions for me, and complies. 

I come back and go to bed. She was really tired so typical LMR wouldn't have been effective here because she would've just fallen asleep, so I tried a technique I had success with the night before - I gave her a slight neck rub with one hand while she was trying to spoon with me. She says ""that's really good, can you massage me."" I tell her ""I usually don't spoil strangers like this but I'll give a quick 3 minutes, but you need to remove your shirt unless you want to get my lotion on it."" Again, keeping it subtle. As I gave her a quick massage, I licked her ear and kissed her neck. She got really turned on and we finally started making out. I started fingering her after a while and it got heavy. SHE asked me, does your roommate have any condoms? It went down. Complete side note, the best thing was that I liked this girl and had a great time with her and we talked for hours after sex.

Let me fill you in about myself, 22, good forever alone candidate, virginity intact, and before discovering this subreddit had only pulled one girl in my life. But after years of this I've decided enough was enough, and about a month ago I started taking the stuff I learned here out in the field.

Week 1 was uneventful, I couldn't shake AA and remained my usual AFC self. But I didn't let this get me down.

Week 2 I found the don't give a fuck mantra and things instantly changed. This was the week of Halloween, and I was out, the anxiety melted away and chatted up a load of girls with no success, I posted about it check my post history (don't have the link to hand and I'm on my phone typing this).

Week 3 Emboldened by the previous weeks success I was full of confidence. And successfully got my first pull in half a year (also posted about this).

And finally this week out again and feeling good, scored my first number close and today I set up a date with the girl for next Monday.

Can't wait for next week to see what's in store for me. These accomplishments may sound weak for veterans here but for me the progress is exponential.

Thanks for the great turn out and great questions guys. Really enjoyed this.**

Hey everybody. Happy to be back on Seddit doing another AMA. I really enjoyed my last one. 

Quick blurb about me: 

I'm a PUA veteran. I found the community in 2005 and got success pretty quickly. I began coaching guys locally in 2007 and in 2008 began my business which was known as ""Practical Pick Up"". Last year I retired from coaching and expanded my business into [Postmasculine.com](http://postmasculine.com), a self-development blog for men. 

When it comes to dating and pick up advice, here's what makes me different:

- Seduction is an emotional process, to become good at seduction is to become an emotionally healthy individual who attains social and sexual confidence. 

- I like to say if you can walk and you can talk then you can pick up a hot girl. There's no skill to it. 

- Don't believe me, then ask yourself this: Why does a first date with a hot woman FEEL so much more complicated and stressful than dinner with a business associate or friend of friend? When confronted with sexual situations, a lot of our emotional baggage, our shame, our insecurities, our poor self image, this stuff all comes roaring out of us. The skill is sorting through this emotional garbage to free yourself up to act openly and confidently no matter who you're with. 

- Attraction is not about what you say or do, but about who you are. You can have the coolest line in the world, but if you're a loser and are desperate to impress her, you will kill any attraction. You could say the dumbest thing in the world, but if you're a cool guy, it won't matter, in fact it will likely make her like you even more. 

- You become an attractive individual by investing in yourself rather than in the women you are pursuing. Sex and women is a side effect of becoming an emotionally competent and sexually confident man, not the cause of it. 

- Honesty is the best policy. As is making yourself vulnerable to rejection and judgment. As is connecting with women on an emotional level. Stop acting like a social robot and create some goddamn romance!

- In my opinion, despite claiming to be ""scientific"" about its processes, PUA completely misses the boat on science. There's decades of scientific research on confidence, self esteem, social anxiety, conquering phobias, sexual insecurity, dating and attraction, and PUA is sorely unaware of a large amount of it. 

- Although I still write a lot about dating, a large portion of my site these days is dedicated to self development, self esteem, life purpose, entrepreneurship, happiness, etc. 

But since this is Seddit, here are some of my better dating articles to check out:

- [Why It's So Hard: Modern Dating for Men](http://postmasculine.com/why-its-so-hard)

- [My Life as a Pick Up Artist](http://postmasculine.com/pickup-artist)

- [Power in Vulnerability](http://postmasculine.com/power-in-vulnerability)

- [Shut Up and Kiss Her](http://postmasculine.com/shut-up-and-kiss-her)

- [Meta-Awesomeness](http://postmasculine.com/meta-awesomeness)

Oh, and last thing. This is the one and only open pitch I'll do the whole night. 

I wrote a book. It's called [Models: Attract Women Through Honesty](http://postmasculine.com/models). It's 350 pages, based on real psychological research, and has been called by a number of guys around Seddit as the best book on seduction and dating for men. 

OK, that's all. Ask away!

I nonchalantly replied, ""That's ok. No worries.""

It took her off guard and she stammered the same thing again.  To which I said, ""Well, ok.  Take care of yourself."" Then hung up.

The thing is, this wasn't me playing cool or actually having attachment to her and denying it.  I have a bevy of other women I'm dating now (THANK YOU, SEDDIT!), so 1 less really is no big deal and *good* because if she's not into me, I don't want to date her.

Before Seddit, I would be attached to any woman who'd give me the time of day.  I'd be asking this chick, ""Why? Why?"" and pleading with her to change her mind.

So a million times thank you to you guys for turning my dating life around!

Later on in the night I am talking to the person to the left of me about geology and how I loved camping in Wyoming and Montana. After that conversation died I overheard my girlfriend talking to the two women when one of them said something about geology.

Naturally I listened more intently. She basically said how she had met this guy who was a geology major and she was struck by how passionate and excited he became talking about geology. She said she could tell how much he loved and enjoyed what he was doing and that she found his enthusiasm very attractive. 

Pretending to not be listening I then heard my girlfriend say I was the same way and that was how I grabbed her attention. And to think all this time I thought it was my physique.

I've found that vocal exercises can automatically make your voice project. Even when you're talking normally. Here's how. 

Take a deep breath through your nose. Tuck your chin down to your chest and hum deeply from the back of your throat. Slowly lift your head up until your chin is basically pointing to the roof, all the while humming. This stretches and strengthens your vocal cords and gives your voice more of the natural bass you have but don't use. 


Also, Cold drinks make your vocal muscles tighten, which makes your voice higher and smaller. Notice how your voice is always deepest in the mornings? It's because your throat muscles are relaxed. I've been doing this for the last week and it's freaking unbelievably the way people react to a strong and dominant voice.

So set a reminder on your phones so that once a day you hum and do the exercise. I promise you won't regret it. Seriously, try it now. 


Edit: after doing some research, I've discovered that it's not bad to do this, but you shouldn't be stressing your vocal cords.

1333377335.0,269,self.seduction,rpjeg,[FR] Five approaches EVERY SINGLE DAY for the entire month of March.,310,41,197,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/rpjeg/fr_five_approaches_every_single_day_for_the/,"Hey guys. So I just finished my March Madness pick up challenge of doing a minimum of five approaches (opening a set with the hope of closing) every single day, and let me say, I’m very proud of the progress that I’ve seen. 

Before I continue on and reveal the stats that I’ve kept track of, I’d like to tell you a bit about my previous lack of ability to approach and my sources of learning and inspiration for practicing pick up. 

Prior to this challenge, I had *a lot* of difficulty approaching. I could really only get myself to do it if I was feeling particularly confident or apathetic to outcome. Now, however, approaching has become no big deal. I’ll occasionally feel approach anxiety, most often when the girl is surrounded by lots of other people, but even then I can often break through the anxiety. I’ve also greatly improved my kino, eye contact, posture, vocal projection, escalation, staying in set, and closing skills. The progress that I have experienced is reflected in the stats, which I will get to in a moment.

In terms of what has helped me so far, after reading *The Game*, I read Tyler’s *Blueprint Decoded* PDF, which was amazingly helpful. Then I watched The Blueprint Decoded videos. Then I read *The Power of Now*. I’ve watched as many RSD infield videos that I could find. [This one’s my favorite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=tlWrFgIR6CU). I’ve also read tons of field reports on RSD Nation. The following users, [Madison](http://www.rsdnation.com/node/155454?page=3) and [Distant Light](http://www.rsdnation.com/node/168409), have had many great posts that have been of help to me.

From all of these resources, it was clear that the guys who have seen the most development have gone out consistently for many days straight. I knew that it was the best way to see progress, and to see it fast. This is what caused my March Madness challenge to come into fruition.

**So finally without further ado, here it is:**

She gave me her phone number with the explicit understanding that she wanted to see me again.

-The girl from 3/9 invited me over to her place at 10:15 PM. I knew what that meant. I went over there and sat down on the couch with her. The problem was that I sat too far from her and didn’t make an attempt to slide closer to her. This made everything awkward and I didn’t try to escalate. 30 minutes after getting there she told me I should leave. Once I did, she texted me saying that things wouldn’t work out between us. It was bad and I was so disappointed in myself that I couldn’t sleep.

-1 phone number.


* 3/26/12 – Monday 

-6 day/street approaches.

-4 phone numbers!

-7 days straight getting at least one phone number!

-1 night/bar approach. It was a 2 set surrounded by guys who were occasionally talking to them. I went in and did my first AMOG approach- and I pulled it off...mostly. My wing got one girl’s number, and things were going very well with my girl even though I couldn’t get her number.


* 3/27/12 – Tuesday 

-7 day/street approaches.

-2 phone numbers.

-Went for drinks with a girl from 3/26. Made out heavily with her and a lot of petting. Made sure to sit next to her right from the get go. This made things ridiculously easy. Couldn’t pull because she was 20, in college, and had an essay due the next morning.

-2 subway approaches.

-2 subway phone numbers! – The first one I got on the way to the date. The girl was cute and I wanted to get a phone number to pump my state. The second one was with a girl after my date. I was frustrated that I couldn’t pull so I tried to instadate with a girl in the subway. The best I could do was a phone number.


* 3/28/12 – Wednesday 

-6 day/street approaches. Did the approaches by myself, in the rain, in 20 minutes. A huge improvement from the beginning of the month.

-1 phone number, from a girl in the subway.


* 3/29/12 – Thursday 

-8 day/street approaches by myself. Did them fast again.

-4 night/bar/street approaches.

-Made out heavily with a cougar. Got her number and went to a different place. Started talking to a cuter girl at the new place and the cougar texted me and invited me to come join her at her apartment. Turned down the offer so I could continue talking with the cuter girl. Big mistake.


* 3/30/12 – Friday 

-6 night/street approaches.

-3 phone numbers, two of which are very interested in seeing me again.

-2 night/bar approaches.

-1 make out w/ heavy groping. The girl was really into me but I got sexually aggressive too quickly and scared her off.


* 3/31/12 – Saturday

-10+ night/street approaches. My fifth approach celebrating the end of the challenge was glorious. 2 set. Both hot. I opened them by explaining that they were the fifth approach of the challenge and that they should feel honored. I got the hotter girl’s phone number.

-2 phone numbers.

-Then the girl from 3/27 came to visit me. As I was kissing her again, I realized I was no longer interested in her. I convinced her that I was tired and that I had to walk her back to her residence hall and then get some sleep. I did that and then continued the sarge.

-4 apocalypse openers. The first one went extraordinarily well and I was close to pulling it off. With a little bit of practice, I think I’ll get the hang of it.

-1 subway approach with a legit 9.5 and one of the hottest girls I’ve ever seen. It was 3 AM. I was on the subway coming home. The subway was relatively crowded for the late hour. Even after all the approaches, I still had anxiety, but I knew I had to do it, and I did. I may have not gotten her phone number, but I felt proud for being able to use my month of training to overcome this approach anxiety. And my newfound ability to deal with rejection made the blow out feel like a nice end to a conversation rather than a legit blow out.


***Condensed stats:***

**-221+ approaches.**

**-34 phone numbers.**

**-4 legit pull opportunities.**


I would encourage everybody to do this. At first it was very difficult and I struggled to do just 15 days straight. There were times where I really hated sarging, where all I wanted to do was give up and go home…but I am so glad I didn’t. My approach anxiety and fear of rejection has decreased significantly, and it shows in the stats. I became much more consistent and fearless in the final 11 days.

I’m feeling increasingly like a man of value, and this is something that bleeds into all parts of my life, not just the way I deal with women.

FINALLY, I WILL BE CONTINUING TO GO OUT EVERY SINGLE DAY. I KNOW I HAVE IT IN ME. **I LIVE IN NYC AND INVITE ANYBODY WHO IS INTERESTED TO COME SARGE WITH ME!**

1375455582.0,268,self.seduction,1jkf7z,Tips for Introverts,340,72,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1jkf7z/tips_for_introverts/,"I see a lot of people posting about introversion and I wanted to give a few pointers on what I've learned since diagnosing myself as an introvert. 

**Background**

Some signs you might be an introvert:

* Long social events can be exhausting

* You need quiet time to recharge

* You don't like small talk and prefer more meaningful conversations. People might criticize you for being too serious.

Some misconceptions about introverts:

* Introverts have poor social skills

* All introverts are shy

Obviously, there are entire personality surveys dedicated to determining whether or not you're introverted, I just picked a few points I saw as relevant to seduction. If you want to learn more about introversion, I highly recommend [Quiet](http://books.google.com/books/about/Quiet.html?id=uyjf3uaQ4TwC) by Susan Cain. This book helped me realize what my strengths were and allowed me to be confident expressing myself for who I am. Like I said, introverts get a bad rep and I hear people mention it on reddit like it's some sort of condition. America is a majority extroverted culture, but many Asian cultures are majority introverted. It's just a different way of interacting.

**Tips**

* Get out early! If you're going to bars on a Friday or Saturday, don't wait until everyone is drunk and rowdy. Coming into that environment can be overwhelming and your AA will be much stronger. If you get out early, it will feel like people are coming to *you*. You'll have time to adjust to the vibe and you'll feel more confident approaching. 

* Make your approaches count. This can be applied to introverts or extroverts, but I think it's vital for introverts. If I'm not clicking with a girl, I eject before I expend too much energy. Small talk is exhausting and if I waste my time forcing it, I'll be too drained to approach anyone else.

* Learn how to fake extroversion. This doesn't mean faking who you are, it just means modifying how you interact with people. Introverts will often just smile and nod when listening (which can come off a little creepy if a person doesn't know you). Sometimes to get more engaged, I force myself to verbally agree and maybe even just repeat part of what the person is saying. Small talk drives me nuts, but you need to do it until she's comfortable taking the conversation a little deeper.

* Find a chatty friend. Obviously, a good wing man is helpful in any situation but I realized that my friends talk way more than I do. They keep the ball rolling on small talk and I'll only speak when I can say something with conviction. I can change the focus of a conversation with a few words and it generates a lot of attraction.

* Be aware of the noise level. I have decent club game because I love to dance but I'd never try having an extended conversation because my voice is pretty quiet. I rely almost entirely on body language. I avoid bars that play loud music because if I'm at a bar, I'd prefer to be somewhere I can have a conversation without yelling -- it kills any sort of chemistry if she's constantly asking, ""WHAT?"". If a bar is playing music, stay away from the speakers. *Quiet* mentions that introverts tend to have softer voices. 

Hope this was helpful!

1343264243.0,268,self.seduction,x5w46,[FR] Bus Girl,345,77,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x5w46/fr_bus_girl/,"I'm feeling pretty good right now. So there I was going back from work on the bus and I see this girl walk in slow motion through the window to the bus. She had purple hair highlights, boobs bigger than my head, and was wearing light flowery summer dress that made my dick well up faster than anyone can say ""massive erection.""

The bus was crowded. I was in the middle of the bus and since she just got on, she was in the front. 

All that went through my mind was: ""How can I meet her? How can I walk up to the front this bus?"" I didn't feel panicy. I felt calm, like a hunter seeing his prey (a horny hunter) I felt a little nervous, but very very calm. All that daygame approaches I did before in the past weekends made me confident that I can approach her without fail. I didn't care who was around me. They will all forget who I am tomorrow. I will either become the guy who got shot down or the guy who got the number. 

I saw an opening, a man near me was nudging himself forwad. I followed his lead. I was right behind her. She was on the right side and I was on the left. 

I turned around.
""Excuse me, "" I said, in the most swagalicious voice. 
She lookeda t me and looked away. I didnt give up. ""Excuse me"" I said again.  She pulled out her earbud.

""I don't do this alot but I saw you walking to the bus and I thought you were really cute. So, I had to come say hi.""

She smiled. Her teeth showed. They were pearly white.

""Hi, my name is ChefPorkchop.""

We shake hands, she gives me her name. We talk about random things. the lady sittign in front of us looked at us. I told the lady: ""Yea, I'm hittign on this girl next to me."" 

The girl laughed. She had this cute lip ring on the top of her lip. We talked about work, jobs, school. She is a bartender. Score.

The lady in front of us leaves. I tell her ""So is this the part where I am chivalrous and let you have the seat?""

She smiles more, sits down. I was getting off in five minutes.

 And then, this is where the best part happened. She PULLED OUT HER OWN PHONE AND ASKED ME FOR MY NUMBER.

In my head I was doing backflips. But I was trembling. A girl hasn't made me nervous feeling in forever. 

My stop was coming up and I mistimed the whole idea that I could get her number. We hugged and I got off. She said she will text me. I didn't get her number.

I was excstatic. No girl has asked for my number first. EVER. Holy fuck. This feeling is sensational.

A couple of years ago I submitted a post titled [""Pickup Material""](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/cixay/pickup_material/). As you can see in the OP, some of you thanked me, and others didn't see all this as productive material, since it fell into what is known as ""armchair"" pua. 

I haven't been very active in this subreddit and I don't know what the trend is now, but I do still have everything from the OP.

With Megaupload going down, all the links are now broken. I've been getting A LOT of PMs to upload it again in .torrent format to make it available once more. 

I haven't expanded on what I have, it's the same stuff you see there.

So, before putting time and effort into it, I wanted to make sure that everyone (or at least everyone) is OK with this. 

I am aware that everything is probably already available online, and that I'm just acting as a middleman, so to speak, but if you guys want me to upload it we can put it in the sidebar as a reference guide for everyone to access.

A bit of texting more, I eventually shoot her with ""You get an A for effort, but an F for application.""
She obviously asks how she can get extra credits, I suggest a few beers in a local park with her lingerie (multi-threading fucking works)
She agrees. Ohhh man.

Meet up in park, kino escalate until I've got her head in one hand and her chin in the other. As I slowly pull her towards me, I cock my head to the side and at the very last second say ""Pff, you can't get me that easy"".
I honestly wish I could share the look she flashed me. Pure hatred mixed with unadulterated desire.

A bit more push/pull, neg and teasing, I eventually kiss her and invite her back to my house. She very enthusiastically agrees.

This past weekend, I was out at a latin club. I saw a really hot (HB9) older chick wearing a leopard print dress and over-the-knee boots dancing by herself at the edge of the dance floor. I didn't hesitate for a half a second. I immediately asked her to dance. At the time, the possibility of her rejecting me didn't even cross my mind. That's not to say that it's impossible, just that it seriously didn't even occur to me. She said yes, and we spent the rest of the night dancing, buying each other drinks (she bought me my first one) and making out. There was even a possibility for a SNL but logistical issues got in the way. We did end up in her car doing more than making out, but I'll leave out the details.

The next day we were texting back and forth, and she said this to me: ""Thank you for having the confidence to come up and ask me to dance. I'm thinking a lot of guys have a fear of rejection. That's another thing that attracts me to you.""

I couldn't believe she said that! It's like she's been reading seddit or something. The funny thing is, at the time I wasn't even thinking about being confident.

If you're in those shoes, read this quickly:

I didn't kiss a girl till 20. Because I was scared. Had a few opportunities (not too many) before then, was too scared.

Why was I scared? I THOUGHT WAY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT.

This is the problem if you have anxiety about never having kissed a girl. You think about it. And then you think about those thoughts you've thought about. And then you think about those thoughts about the thoughts you've thought about.

You continue thinking about it until you have anxiety stemming from every single angle.

Will my breath smell?
Do I open my mouth?
Will I miss her lips?
Will her breath smell?
Will she hate me?
Do I apply chapstick 10 minutes before?
What if my mouth is dry?
What do I do with my hands?

I can't even remember half the anxiety I had about kissing.

And do you want to know why?

BECAUSE NONE OF IT FUCKING MATTERED!!!!!!

Kissing is NATURAL. You already know what to do. Even if you don't think you do, trust me – YOU DO. And when the time comes, you'll nail it.

That doesn't mean you'll have a perfect kiss... it could suck. But get this: the quality of the kiss—in most cases—has much more to do with the chemistry between you two than your actual ""technical abilities"".

Don't worry about technique... not in kissing or sex (but be aware of the female anatomy). It's about chemistry, being in the moment, and connecting with another individual. 

Breath: it matters, but it's not the biggest deal in the world. Unless your breath smells like death—which it won't—you'll be fine. No need to pop tic-tacs every 10 mins.

To illustrate this: before I kissed girls, I always was chewing gum and using mints to keep my breath ""fresh"". Now, I never chew gum and very rarely use mints. 

If you have good hygiene (brush your teeth 2x a day, floss, use mouthwash), you will have zero problems in this area.

I was always worried I'd miss her lips. Nope, that didn't happen either... easiest shit in the world. You will do it naturally.

Fit the lips like puzzle pieces... one on top of the other. They lock perfectly like this. 

Kissing is natural. It's easy. If you have a bad kiss, you're not a horrible person... it was bad chemistry. 

Lastly..........

KISSING IS FUN.

So there.

OH FUCK EDIT: Jesus, can't believe I forgot this part... I remember staying up all night long worrying about this shit... was I going to die a virgin, and never even kiss a girl? Of course I wasn't! This shit happens if you want it to, but it happens on an individual timeline, separate from societies agenda for you.

You feel shitty because society has told you to feel shitty. That's literally the only reason. You can opt out.

Oh, ONE LAST THING:

Want to know how you can get over your fear and push your life forward? Decide to do it. That's all it takes. Make a decision and fully commit to do it. I set myself a goal the year I got my first kiss and lost my virginity. And the goal was to do just that. I fully committed... if I had to, I would've left the country and spent all my money to do it (not that that ever would've been necessary).

But you need to make a decision and fully commit to it. This is how you make things happen in your life. Spending time being anxious about things is doing you no good. Anxiety is ok, but it doesn't help you. What helps you is to make a decision and commit fully to it. Have courage!

UH, ANOTHER IMPORTANT EDIT:

Think of kissing and sex like jazz. It's not only on your end, and it's not only on her end. It changes, adapts, evolves... don't worry about technique, focus on the moment and what she's doing, AND LISTEN TO THE MOOD. As you kiss, you'll feel like doing one thing or another.

Build your social competence - speak well, physically calm your body, and be well-groomed and presentable.
2. In all things that don’t involve life or death, challenge yourself, and risk failure. This is how you grow and evolve as a person.
3. Stop making value judgments about yourself and your abilities, and stop theorizing about what you can and can’t do. You might surprise yourself.
4. Have a coach, mentor, or someone you really trust to keep you grounded. They will help keep you on course, and keep you accountable to yourself.
5. Don’t make your whole life about any ONE thing – especially dating. Living a balanced life is the best way to keep your life from falling apart like a card castle when something goes wrong.

I have sex with various women 2 to 4 times a week.",378,113,310,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mfkko/seduction_i_have_no_knowledge_of_your_ways_im_a/,"First off, I'll admit--I haven't looked very closely through all the literature available online about seduction. It's kind of overwhelming, honestly. Lots of jargon and abbreviations, etc. Not to mention all the concepts like framing and shit tests. Some of the things suggested are a little weird to me like ""Touch everyone you talk to"" in the beginner's section (who does that?).

I guess I posted this because I hope you might have some questions that could be answered from the perspective of someone who doesn't ""seduce"" but gets a lot of sex. Just a different point of view to freshen things up...

A little about my sex life. I've had about three real male friends my whole life that I love and respect. I consider all other males in my life either family or simply passing acquaintances who I spend only necessary amounts of time with (coworkers, etc). All my other friends are females. I've made out with most of them. The other I consider to be like sisters and am very close and protective of them. Others I've had one night stands or a few hook up occasions. And a few, I have sex regularly with. Looking through my phone, I see that at this moment there are at least four (maybe five) girls that, once I set myself to it, I could be in bed with in the next 24 to 48 hours. I have sex as much as I want, and sometimes a bit more. I can't remember the last time I jerked off. I've turned down sex on several (not many) occasions. I might have a threesome or two every semester or so.

That's pretty much been a steady situation for me for the past ten years or so, although different girls come and go in and out of my life. Some for a few weeks. Others for years.

Picking up women at a bar that I don't know is a completely foreign concept to me. I rarely go to bars or clubs. I dislike them very much, honestly. Also, I can't think of anything more unattractive than some bursting-with-cum inexperienced little asshole putting on his fucking clown show in the middle of people trying to have a proper time. I'd rather never have sex again than be that guy.

I feel like my success with women comes from the following:


1) I only make friends with attractive, available women who are likely to be into promiscuous sex. I go for smart, low-drama girls who are also very social. Dumb, jealous, air-headed, argumentative, stuck-up bitches get absolutely no attention from me whatsoever. (Guess which type you are more likely to find at a bar/night club as opposed to, say, volunteering at the local food bank) Yes, this is the part of my life where I put all of my human vanity and shallowness into although I treat all people with respect.

2) I'm good at telling when women are interested in me or not. If they're not, I immediately push away my sexual feelings for them. I'm very good at that (pushing away feelings). I didn't use to be. It takes practice and a few heart breaks. After that, I am genuinely interested in being friends and so I naturally act accordingly. Some times we end up having sex anyway. Sometimes not. If I can't tell, I put them on the spot with physical affection. Usually, I'll either just hold their hand or maybe kiss them on the neck a few times when they hug me. If it wasn't clear before, this always makes it so one way or another. Again, If there is no attraction, I move on as if nothing happened and just let it be a friendship.

3) I'm not a porn star in bed, but I make sure I'm having sex as much for her as I am for myself. That means I should smell and taste clean. It means I pay attention to what she likes or doesn't.

4) Sex is never the reason why we're friends or the reason I ask to hang out. Ever. Sex is an added bonus. It something that just happens. We go out. We go swimming. We play tennis. We go to happy hour to have a few drinks together. We have dinner. We catch up on how our week went. Sex is not the point of my life. Its a thing I do because I'm a human being. Like eating or sleeping.

5) This is probably the most important one. No jealousy, games, hen-house bullshit, possessiveness, checking-up on, clingyness... I don't know what else to list here. What happens in the bedroom, happens in the bedroom. Outside of that, I respect these people and keep a healthy distance. I never talk about what we do to anyone. I rarely bring it up verbally when we're not doing it, even to them (there are exceptions with a few of them on this point). I can't count the number of guys who come in and out of their lives (again, not a flinch on my part ever) who just get thrown out very quickly because of how much of an emotional/social mess they are. Boys just can't get it through their heads they can't own women and that the girls they sleep with aren't their mommies. Even the so-called ""players"" eventually turn to mush.

Should I add a few more points?

**edit 1**

So I am learning a lot about your community since posting this. There have probably been a lot of posts about this, and I overestimated my capacity to ""help"" (how presumptuous, truly!). It's difficult to put into words.

I guess what my input here really boils down to is this (and, again, probably doing a shitty job of writing it down in a practical sense): you were born to do this. the connection between you and another person is the most natural and human thing there can be. if this isn't what you're experiencing maybe your heart is closed or damaged or you're completely surrounded by assholes. perhaps a war manual isn't what you need?

please forgive my ignorance! maybe i'm wrong--i don't know enough. it is my opinion at this point.

**edit 2**

thanks for being so patient with me. yea, i had a really negative and narrow-minded view of what really goes on here. what i saw as a group of predators is actually not that at all. its hilarious how wrong i am.

its clear i misjudged many things and it seems the thread is dying down now. i agree some men are lonely and you've got a pretty good way going in response to that. i mean, guys are hooking up as a result. and getting into relationships, etc. that being said, here's some of my comments i'd like to leave you with:

i think these sort of bring out what i was trying to contribute a little more clearly. but, no, i'm not the best at communicating this stuff verbally. thanks. i will never again look down upon someone trying to hook up at a party or pick up my friends at a bar. i understand there's real human struggle and pain but also great potential there just waiting to come out. ya done good.

**edit 4 (6:30 p.m. central time)**

just got back from class and there's tons more comments. i've been up for two days cramming for an exam and need to get some shut eye. will get to all the new comments in about 12 hours. great community of interesting, intelligent people here. i'm glad i ran across it.

**edit 5**

So this has been a pretty cool discussion. I tried to get to everyone's PMs and comments. I've learned a lot about this community and I've also learned a lot about myself. You have taught me to look at myself in a new way. I am now paying attention to little things I do that I didn't realize I did before. You're right. There ARE things I do to get closer to people. To get their attention. To do what I want them to do.

I will be writing these things down, and sharing them with you in future posts. I will also be avoiding delving too deeply into the material that already exists. If my material is redundant, so be it. This very post might not even be here if I knew then, when I was pushing the submit button, what I know.

I think the problem comes down to neediness.

**What AFCs think is romantic: drama**

Love songs, Disney, and Hollywood all glorify the AFC living a *pained existence* and eventually getting the girl.

The AFC is mopy, sensitive, dramatic, and emo. He thinks she is the one. He needs her for validation, and will sacrifice everything for her.

Maybe the AFC is a soldier, like in Dear John. Maybe the AFC is an awkward nerd, like in Superbad.

It involves: 1) intense and very genuine need; 2) need not being met.

This sells. Why? It creates tension and release. It's a form of story-telling. It is clear that the hero has good qualities that haven't surfaced, and the girl just doesn't see it yet. It offers a hope of winning the lottery without ""selling out"". This false hope is embraced by the majority of the movie-watching population, which happens to contain mostly AFCs. It's the story of the underdog, and losers in life identify with it.

**The problem**

This isn't how the real world works. Imagine a job interview. Is the underdog the guy who gets hired? No, it's the guy who blows everyone away with his amazing resourcefulness, and his abundant ability to add survival value to the firm.

The football team captain gets the girl. The douchebag gets the girl. The fun guy who's having a hilarious and jolly time gets the girl. The guy who's adding value and getting shit done (because he's in a good mood and not moping) gets the girl.

The upstanding ""emo"" self-victimized guy gets dumped. ""Sorry, you're a sweet guy, but I don't like you like that, because you're weak and lame.""

When it's done in the movies, the guy is sweet and genuine. But in the real world, the guy is weak. The movies are advocating the epitome of what women find repulsive. Having a guy fall in love with you is disgusting, if he's just a loser.

**Truth: Women don't think romantically**

Imagine yourself in the wild, in cavemen times, when resources were scarce, and a man had to be decisive, or be killed.

Women don't have time for emo neediness. They avoid needy guys; they've experienced needy guys hitting on them, and they try to avoid those guys, because they're an indistinguishable blur of failures. Women try to prevent themselves from feeling needy as well, because they know it's unattractive. Women are practical-minded and abundance-seeking; rarely do they wallow and mope. They are highly emotionally resilient. Sorry, they DO NOT share your feelings of intense longing and sadness.

Unfortunately, a lot of AFCs don't have much experience with needy women. So they aren't aware of the repulsiveness of neediness. So they think it's OK if they feel it. They think it's romantic, and idealize their needy behaviors as being genuine and devoted. They're living in a sheltered false reality.

They don't understand that a woman's biggest turn-on is strength, not weakness.

**The Opposite**

Relaxed, dominant, decisive, commanding, abundant, laughing, self-amusing, engaged, open.

Your state is good, and your strong frame keeps your state from getting fucked by negative thinking, setbacks, blow-outs, amogs, and shit-tests.

In every happy marriage I've seen in real life, the husband was rock solid strong and happy.

**A Good Hack**

Act like a big happy baby, instead of a crybaby. Having fun, being childishly irreverent and carefree. This will break you out of the neediness state.

Remember when your mom was away when you were a kid, and you missed her, and wanted her attention? Don't be that.

Remember when your mom was right there and you were happily busy playing? Be that.

Why spend your time being sad and dramatic and emo, when you can just enjoy the moment and feel good? You put the needy guy and abundant guy side-by-side in your mind, and you see immediately which version of you is more appealing to women.

Assume things are going to be OK, and do your thing. If you feel a lot of freedom, you will naturally be creative and assertive, and she will naturally be attracted to who you are.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_j0ejn,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/j0ejn/why_neediness_is_bad_why_it_exists_and_how_to_fix/,

Out of 100+ people, we spotted maybe three 2-sets of girls in the entire venue. The rest was comprised of big sets - either big mixed sets of guys and girls hanging out as friends, or big groups of 4+ girls, and a bunch of thirsty dudes on the prowl.

Clearly, this is a common enough phenomenon for an internet meme to have gone viral:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRMmHbHxBY0

We wondered why there are so few 2-sets at bars and clubs nowadays, and attributed it to Facebook and online dating. Whereas single women in 5-10+ years ago went to ""singles bars"" actively looking to meet new men, today they're sitting at home in their PJs on Facebook and POF/OKC searching for Mr. Right/Mr. Right Now. Do ""singles bars"" even exist anymore?

So girls go out in big groups to ""party"", get attention/validation/free drinks for the night, go home and discreetly booty text their FWB/fuck buddy/ex BF, and get some good sex for the night. Why go home with a random creeper and look like a slut in front of all your friends when you've got dick on tap 24/7 via your smartphone?

This is even more true for smartphone-addicted college girls with vast social circles. And this is also why tourists, cougars and ""new to the city"" women are easier to pull - they don't have access to vast social circles with dick on tap.

All this leads to far fewer guys pulling from a pure cold approach today than in 2002. Not because guys today have shitty game, but because the number of single women at bars and clubs actually looking to hook up has gone way down. And all due to the explosion of social networking, online dating and smartphones in the past decade, giving girls constant attention, validation and access to an infinite supply of dick.

Thoughts? Particularly interested in hearing from the older 30+ American/Canadian cats if they've also witnessed this change over the years.

I went through a 4 week acute severe depression. I even considered killing myself. One wonderful day, the sun woke me up before my alarm could do it, and suddenly a thought crossed my mind. Why the fuck are you depressed? That thought surprised me. I began thinking about why I'm depressed. And suddenly my depression didn't make any sense any more. And that's when I said ""Fuck it"". Over the course of a few days and with the help from a few real life and internet friends, I broke completely free of the depression, and now I'm back. Stronger than ever before and more motivated than ever before. My mindset right now is absolutely indescribable. I learned to love myself, love everything I've achieved and everything I can achieve. I am proud of myself and especially of the fact that I was stuck in hell and managed to break free.

And now to you.

You're fucking awesome.

If you have any, I repeat, ANY, even the slightest doubts about this statement, you've got a serious problem and you need to take care of it right now.

I want you to think about why you don't think you're the single most awesome, most Alpha, most friendly, most sexy person on earth. 

Are you fat? Are you shy? Do you have three eyes?

ANYTHING that you're not satisfied with about yourself will affect your whole life. Don't believe me? Then why are you scared of escalating? Maybe because of that fat on your stomach?

It is INCREDIBLY FUCKING IMPORTANT that you like yourself and that you're 100%ly satisfied with every single aspect of your life. Routines and magic tricks don't mean SHIT if you're unhappy with yourself, because you lack elementary confidence in yourself and your actions. 

Are you scared of approaching women? Then go out and fucking do something against it.
Are you fat? Go to the fucking gym and work out until you're completely satisfied with your appearance.

Trust me - If you don't have any success with women right now, focus completely on being 100%ly happy about yourself. The resulting unbreakable confidence and charisma will attract every woman you can only dream about at the moment.

Get your fucking life in order, take responsibility for yourself and learn to love yourself. If you don't love yourself, DON'T EXPECT ANYONE ELSE TO BE ABLE TO LOVE YOU.

I'm not perfect myself and there's a few things that are keeping me from being completely satisfied with myself, but I take deep comfort and confidence in the fact that I'm working hard to change that.

There are no magic words.


But there’s something even better…


YOU. 


Okay, enough cheesiness for one moment. But it’s absolutely true. You are the key to making this happen for yourself. The only thing that gets in the way is your mind. That stupid little voice that says:


*“I’m scared”*

*“I’ll get rejected”*

*“What if people see me?”*

*“I’m not good enough”*


Let me say, in the most professional way, FUCK that voice. That’s not you. That’s your scumbag brain trying to mess with your improvement. Tell it to shut up. Instead listen to ME. There are 3 easy actions to take in order to get good fast:

**1) Talk to everyone, always.** Whenever you get out of the house and come across people at the bus stop, train station, school, grocery store, etc. always look for an opening for conversation. Get your brain used to having conversations with strangers. In other words, be social. Embody what it ‘s like to be a talkative, interesting and social person. It doesn’t matter what you say or how you say it, just talk. You’d be surprised how many people will respond. Here are a few examples:

*“I couldn’t help but over hear you say xyz, well I also xyz”*

*“The weather is so nice/bad today, I love it/hate it”*

*“I love (insert grocery/purchase item here), I use/buy/read that all the time”*



**2) Flirt with every woman.** Okay, maybe not your grandma, but any woman you come across, throw in a few flirts. Now you’re getting used to know what it’s like to be a flirty man. Show your intent! You’re going to need these skills when the time comes to flirt with the women you actually want. Compliments work great. Here are a few examples:

*“That (insert clothing item here) is really sexy”*

*“We’ve been talking for about 5 minutes now and I just noticed how beautiful your eyes are”*

*“You have the sexiest…little…elbows!”*



**3) Set a plan and be consistent.** Although this is #3 in the list, it is the most important. Check your schedule and set 1 week aside (which really isn’t that long) and go out EVERY one of those nights. In most cities you should be able to find something going on, whether it is an event or club/bar. You can go alone or go with a wingman; it doesn’t matter. Go out and talk to people. Approach people. Make friends and conversations. Flirt with every woman! The trick is to make sure you don’t skip ANY night. Not even one. The goal is to go out seven nights in a row. By the fourth night you are going to start feeling something special, you’ll see.

If you want to get good at something fast, then the key is to repeat, fail, repeat, fail, repeat, and fail, until you succeed. Never give up. Even if it is the hardest thing to accomplish, DON’T GIVE UP. 

I heard a quote once that if you take one more step past the hardest point, then that’s where you meet success. So the question is, how bad do you want it?

**TL;DR** – repetition is the key to success

1376062103.0,258,self.seduction,1k13ih,[FR] - First time working a Mother/Daughter set. Went better than expected (x-post from GothamSeddit),365,107,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1k13ih/fr_first_time_working_a_motherdaughter_set_went/,"Sup Seddit!  It's been a while since my last FR, wanted to tell you about last night's lay.  Enjoy! 

**FIRST APPROACH**

It was a Tuesday noon, coming back from my lunch break.  Walking around Grand Central station, I see a HB8 spanish chick posing while her mother was taking pictures of her.  I muster whatever ounce of boldness I have in my loins and go make my (indirect) approach. 

**""Excuse me, do you want to take a picture together?""**  They say yes, and I happily oblige. 

I immediately ask whether they're mother/daughter (yes), where they're visiting from (Mexico), etc.  I go into my stories of visiting Mexico, partying in Tijuana, kept the convo light but fun.  We talk about what we do for a living.  

Finally, I ask the HB8 **""Hey, can you ask your mother whether she minds if I take her daughter out on a date?""**  She giggles and asks her mother in spanish, the mother laughs and says ""Okay!""  

Right there *I bear-hug the mother and say ""muchas gracias!""* and she says ""ohmygod"".  We snap some pictures together (me w/ the HB8), exchange contact, and say let's grab dinner soon.  They were leaving in 3 days, so I had to act quick. 

That same afternoon, we make plans via text to grab dinner on Thursday. 

**THURSDAY DINNER DATE**

I know lots of people don't think dinner dates are great, but I personally enjoy them.  I think sharing food &amp; drink is just a fun activity.  I arrange for us to have dinner at a restaurant 1/2 a block away from my apt (**logistics**).  Here's how the date went:

As soon as we meet at the designated streets, *I give her a hug/kiss*, describe some of the sights around us, and *immediately put my elbow out so she can hook her arm in*.  Boom.  Frame was set that she's my girl for the duration of this date. 

At the restaurant: while waiting for a table, we sit at the bar w/ a drink.  I order her an old fashioned, and told her this is what New Yorkers drink, I have a gin martini.  **She's sitting on a stool and I'm standing next to her**: this is a *GREAT position* when at the bar - it gives you complete freedom to kino tons, lean in (reward), lean away (display disinterest), etc.  If you're both sitting on stools, it can make it much more awkward to work your space.  During 30 min. at the bar, I had already done tons of kino escalation, slightly pushed her when she said something silly, talked to a guy on the opposite side of me, showing that I'm social and friendly. 

During dinner, I made sure to relate some stories about recent dates I've been on.  I include some great dates I've had, some horrible (and hilarious) dates.  

She at one point tells me she was married for less than a year, said that it was a young, foolish mistake.  I immediately *go into comfort*, put my *hand around her shoulder*, ask how she's been dealing w/ it.  She tells me he was a loser.  I tell her she can probably do much, much better, maybe even get lucky w/ a handsome New Yorker, laugh and put my hand on her thighs. 

***Important note**: At no point during the dinner date did I over-state my interest.  I moved in and out of displaying interest vs disinterest.  I let silence come over the conversation and was perfectly fine with it.  I was completely myself and just comfortable w/ being myself, not trying to impress her.* 

This had the effect of making her wonder if she ""had"" me.  When we were settling up the bill, she was asking if I had fun, if she was interesting to talk to.  I said ""of course I'm having a great time, you're so sweet."" 

Right before we stand up to leave, I turn in, whisper to her *""come here...""* and **caveman kissed her right there**.  It was brief at first before **I break it off**.  She re-engages, and we make out again for about 10-15 sec. 

Things were going well, and we decide to jump over to a great jazz lounge nearby.  

***But first...***

I had some food leftover from dinner that I got wrapped up to-go.  I said let's swing by my apt so I can put the food in the fridge, and also use the restroom.  She's okay with that.  

Right before we head in my building, she asks: ""wait, can I trust you? I barely know you...should I go upstairs?""  

I laugh and say: ""Yes I'm going to kidnap you and sell your body to the mafia.""  

She replies ""okay haha I'll just wait here outside"".  

Then I call her silly (or stupid, can't remember), and just grab her hand and say ""cmon, I'm just going to put the food in the fridge"".

We are upstairs now in my apt.  After I'm done using the restroom, I find her looking at my book collection.  We talk for 2 min. about it, show her what my favorite books are. 

Now I say **""okay, ready?"" and start putting my shoes on**.  

Then she says *""yes...but wait""*  she comes over to me, wraps me in her arms and says *""first...I want to kiss you.""*  We make out, I throw her against the wall and grab one of her legs up and wrap it around me.  Then I move her to the sofa, then the bed...

Like a true gentleman, I made sure she kept her heels on. 

Needless to say...we never made it to the jazz lounge  :)

**Key points:**

* Total lapsed time spent together, from initial meet to sex: 3.5 hours
* Total $ spent: $70
* Total alcoholic beverages consumed: 1 each.
* I never let her have the feeling that she ""had"" me
* Power play 1: as soon as we met for the date, I made us a ""couple"" by being arm-in-arm and leading her by holding her hand
* Power play 2: after dinner, surprised her with an assertive, dominant caveman kiss
* Power play 3: upstairs at the apartment, after I'm done using the toilet, say ""OK let's go"" and tie my shoes.  This was risky, but it played out well for me in this instance.

I'm here to say that it is bullshit.  I have seen why first hand and here is a real life example of 2 roommates I knew in college:

Roommate #1:  About 5'9"", overweight, chubby face, un-athletic, not particularly attractive in any way, a bit of a double chin.  BUT, he was the most charasmatic person I have ever met in my entire life.  He had a golden tongue.  He could talk to anybody, was a confident mother fucker, and a great time to be around.  He had what I called ""irrational confidence.""  That is, he was so confident in himself, without having money, looks, athletic ability, or anything else to back it up.  He was confident because he was confident (not a typo, read it again).

Roommate #2:  About 6'2"", big athletic build, biceps like bowling balls, pecs bigger than most girls, strong jaw line, chiseled features, attractive face.  BUT, this guy was dopey as shit.  He wasn't good at maintaining a conversation, didn't really have anything particularly interesting to say, lacked confidence with the ladies.  

Guess who got laid more?  I have never seen anybody get as much ass as the first guy.  He had numbers like you wouldn't believe.  You know who wasn't successful?  The second guy (unless he was nailing the first guy's leftovers).  He rarely could keep a girl's attention long enough to get with her.

Why?  Because roommate #1's personality was a tractor beam.  You couldn't be in the room with him without feeling his presence.  Guys looked up to him, women saw the respect he got from guys and were drawn to him like he was a celebrity.  He was charasmatic, engaging, funny, confident, interesting.  He had no fear.  I once saw him organize a naked party.  That's right, he convinced everyone to strip down, 1 article of clothing every 15 minutes.  How?   Because he was a leader, and people followed him.  

Never use your looks as an excuse.  It is bullshit and self defeating.  It is not what's holding you back, it's your confidence.


**EDIT**  Good discussion guys.  This seems to be a very polarizing subject.  Reading through the comments, it seems to be about a 50/50 split.  Half of you say that looks aren't that important and confidence is king.  Half of you say that looks are the number 1 limiting factor to picking up women.  I like what Gareth321 said ""Think of being attractive as the best ice breaker. It gets you in the door, which is invaluable. You still need to work on the sale, which is most of the work.""

Personally, I think I would change my title to ""Looks might matter some, but not as much as you think"" or ""Looks can only get you so far, but confidence will get you all the way.""  For me, I realized I had to double up on confidence, personality, and charisma to supplement what I lacked in the looks department.

1346951001.0,261,self.seduction,zggwf,[FR] State your fucking intentions.  ,331,70,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/zggwf/fr_state_your_fucking_intentions/,"Met this HB7 at the bar last week.  Chatted her up, got her number.  We hang out again one night, dance a little bit, kiss a lotta bit.  This isn't a FR about that, this is a FR about making sure you state your intentions and the lesson I learned because I didn't.

We were supposed to hang out last night, but I flaked on her to hang out with a FWB I knew was going to be a sure thing.  She flaked on me earlier in the week so I knew this was a last ditch effort to turn this into something more. 

I hit her up today to see if she wants to hang out tonight.  This my friends, is why you don't text a bunch of random shit and you should state your intentions EARLY.  I had this girl thinking I wanted a relationship because I wasn't clear on what I wanted from the get go.




**Me:**  Sorry about flaking last night.  Had a long day at work, blah blah blah blah blah.  Let's do something tonight, what time are you off?

**HB7:**  It's ok, I was tired.  You should go out and have fun cause I never know when I get off work and if I will be tired.  Don't want you waiting around for me.

*At this point I'm writing her off...I didn't quite realize why she was flaking again because she seemed plenty into me the night we were dancing.*

**Me:**  You're a hard one to pin down HB7.  I'll just leave this be.  Hope to see you out some time.

**HB7:**  :( sorry I don't mean to...Just getting over stuff.  I hope you have a good day.

**Me:**  No worries, I wasn't looking for anything serious.  Just wanted to have some fun.  Good luck with everything.  :)

**HB7:**  I feel bad cause I don't feel I can give you my full attention right now and you deserve that.  Hanging out I can do if you want.  If not then I understand...

*Holy fuck...at this point I realized this girl thinks I'm trying to take her to relationship land.*

**Me:**  Truth is I'm not looking for a relationship right now, just someone to have a good time with.  If you're down with that, great.  If not, that's ok too.

**HB7:**  :) sounds good...If you want to do a movie tonight I won't be off until 8 or 9.

**Me:**  Alright, see ya then.  :)

**HB7:**  Ok...I'll text you when I am on my way over. :)




Aaaaand it's done.  Lesson learned, never be afraid to state your intentions and move away from those that don't share the same view.  At the start of the text convo I thought she was just brushing me off, I didn't even realize what had happened and what view she had of me.

Since I've started Pickup, I've never had a problem being forward about what my intentions were with someone.  But for whatever reason, I got complacent with this one and she almost slipped away.  

tl:dr STATE YOUR INTENTIONS AND DO IT EARLY

**UPDATE:**

She came over, things got physical but we didn't end up fucking.  She has some issues from previous relationships that prevent that from happening with some dude she just met.  In the end, I see her as someone that will provide more benefit to my social circle than my dick.  We'll be hanging out plenty in the future.

On a side note...while I was waiting for HB7 to come over I went out to one of our local bars.  I've become good friends with the bar tender and the bouncers there.  Cue HB8 walking through the door and chatting up one of the bouncers who I was sitting with.  One thing leads to another and I walk out with her number and her asking when we're going out together...probably one of the easiest closes I've ever had.  Go out, make friends with everyone.  Had I not put the time in to form a relationship with the bar tender and the bouncer, she would have never been as into me as she was.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1347007061.0,,,True,t3_zggwf,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/zggwf/fr_state_your_fucking_intentions/,

1300821516.0,260,self.seduction,g94wr,Book of Body Language Summary,315,55,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/g94wr/book_of_body_language_summary/,"Hey guys,

Somebody posted a link to a [body language book](http://westsidetoastmasters.com/resources/book_of_body_language/toc.html) yesterday. It was pretty big and therefore hard to manage, but it caught my interest. As I was going through, I took notes. I thought you guys might be interested, so here it is.

I've mostly kept them in order of appearance, but I stripped out a couple of the key sections and put them in this post. I'll put the rest in another post in this thread.

-The attraction process typically has five steps:

--1. The woman makes eye contact for a few seconds, then turns her head. The man checks back for more looks. Usually she has to look at him three times for him to realize what the fuck is happening.

--2. The woman gives a quick smile, which is a green-light. Many men fuck it up here.

--3. The woman begins preening, revealing her neck, playing with her hair, or sitting up to emphasize her tits. She might also lick her lips or straighten her clothes. The man usually responds by expanding his chest, sucking in his gut, and straightening his clothes. Both are pointed toward each other.

--4. The man approaches her to talk, usually with something canned or easy.

--5. The woman will initiate some light touch on the arm or hands; repeating the same touches shows that she's comfortable with how things are. Hand touches are more personal than arm touches. Brushing or touching the shoulder shows that she cares about his health or appearance.

-Women commonly use 13 gestures during courtship:

--1. The head toss and hair flick shows interest and that she cares about her appearance around you.

--2. If her lips are wet and pouting, it's a sexual invitation meant to mimic her genitals (blood swells in the lips, breasts, and genitals when aroused, which is also why red lipstick became popular).

--3. If a woman slowly and sensually touches her neck, thigh, or throat, it means that if a man plays his cards, he could touch her in the same way. She's effectively imagining him touching her there.

--4. Allowing her wrist to go limp shows submission, which is of course hot to dominant men.

--5. Fondling a cylindrical object lets you know what's on her mind.

--6. Women will expose their wrists more as interest grows, as the wrist is considered one of their more erogenous zones.

--7. A sideways glance over her shoulder lets her feel like she's peeping, while also making her shoulder mimic the appearance of her tits.

--8. Rolling of the hips is something that only women can do, making it an effective tool for looking sexy.

--9. The pelvic tilt makes her hips look bigger, which is an obvious plus (waist-to-hips ratio is most optimum at 70% btw). It highlights her ability to bear children, which we find hawt.

--10. If a woman puts her handbag close to you, it shows that she's comfortable with you since it holds the majority of their livelihood. She may fondle her purse if she's particularly attracted.

--11. If she tucks one leg under the other, the direction her untucked knee is pointing in is the direction of who's most interesting.

--12. Dangling the shoe on the end of the foot shows relaxation while implying fucking via repetitive thrusting movements.

--13. Placing one leg over the other so that they're parallel signifies that she's ready to screw. Women will also cross and uncross their legs slowly, occasionally stroking her thigh with her hand, to indict a desire to be touched.

-People lean against things (or other people) to show ownership or a terroritorial cliam.

-As a general rule, the higher someone is socio-economically, the less gestures they use.

-Less movement shows confidence, especially while under pressure -- it's how to ""keep your cool."" Jim Carry displays the opposite effect.

-The six secrets of attractive body language

--1. Have an animated face and a smile; be sure to flash your teeth.

--2. Be expressive with your gestures but don't overdo it. Keep your fingers crossed and below your chin, and avoid arm or feet crossing.

--3. Use triple nods when talking and a head tilt when listening. Keep your chin up.

--4. Give the amount of eye contact that makes everyone feel comfortable. Lean forward when listening, stand straight when speaking.

--5. Stand as close as you feel comfortable. If the other person moves back, don't step forward again.

--6. Subtly mirror the body language of others.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_g94wr,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/g94wr/book_of_body_language_summary/,

Also, I started doing translations for a seduction forum in spanish, so I could get my hands on a lot of material.

We go to the same college (which isn't that big.)

I made my way to a houseparty the other night, and came across your typical ""bitch-face"" girl who stands with her friends and is queen of her own little world.

I'm not one to judge a book by its cover, so I approached her. To be honest, I could have judged her by her cover and been 100% correct about her. She was immediately stand-offish, I wasn't about to try any kino, but I wasn't about to give her a reason to immediately reject me.

This is when I started the ""nice guy"" routine. I didn't treat her any differently than the friends she was with, introduced myself to all of them, and was super casual. We were all standing in the kitchen, and made our way into the living room. I isolated her and started asking really open-ended questions about her life - once again, she was really reserved. ""This isn't going to be easy,"" I thought, ""She won't even put her phone away."" 

We were standing in front of a couch, so I sat, and beckoned her to sit too. To my surprise, she did. I turned my whole body towards her, and said, ""Tell me your story."" Again, to my surprise, she started to open up. I asked her if she thought I was dangerous, to which she replied, ""No, I think you're pretty nice."" After a few open ended questions about her upbringing, tattoos, home-life, friends, and hobbies, I had to pee.

I didn't want to leave the couch and come back to her gone, so I told her to hold my beer. *(This was a tip I learned from Seddit, I was amazed at how well it worked.)* She looked a little shocked, but complied.

I drained the main vein and returned to her holding my beer. I took it, muttered ""thanks"" and sat back down. We talked some more, and here are the key points about her verbatim:

Battles eating disorders, has a problem with soft drugs, has a brain tumor that is said to shorten her life 20 years, doesn't want to live long anyways, goes to raves consistently, has had sex with 7 guys, single, doesn't like to be touched, she's adopted, has no concept of money (she's loaded), wants to fly a plane one day, etc.

Frankly, I don't know why I was attracted to her. I like level-headed girls, and part of me was about to back out before I stuck my dick in crazy. She literally told me she doesn't want to live. This girl has issues.

The atmosphere changed a little, moving us around and smoking some fat blunts. This is when I left. *(My game is drastically changed after I get weed in me)*

I wasn't about to let her forget about me, so I added her on Facebook when I got home. To my surprise, she was online. I got her number from her, casually texted her the next day (short and brief, no need to converse over text messages) and set up a coffee date.

In her texts, the shit tests kept flowing. For example:

Me: It's a date.

Girl: I'm not as friendly sober. So don't be surprised

Me: You're not that friendly drunk either.. But I think I can manage. Thanks for the heads up.

Girl: You bet.

Seddit, what are your experiences with girls like this? I'm not about to let her be in control (or treat me like shit) on this date, any tips? Personally, I find sarcasm to work wonders on them.

This worked for me. ,330,76,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/zias7/all_the_guys_having_their_first_aa_problems_this/,"I've read quite a few posts now about guys who are frustrated with the lack of help in making the first step. 

I have to say though, ""just get out there"" really is the most straight forward advice. 

But for someone like me who over analysed EVERYTHING it just didn't work. There was always an excuse, whether it be too many girls, girl on a phone, girl with a guy, or just a girl looking pissed off. I had to think up my own method. 

So what I did was I spent the next 3 weeks of nights out not thinking about the game at all. I went out with the sole intention of simply telling the hottest girls in the bar/club all about ME. 
I never let them turn the conversation on to them and if they did I related it back to a story about me. 
What I noticed was this, once you start to tell girls about all your deepest passions and interests and thoughts. They will listen to it. Some stories will bore her, some will make her laugh, but most of them will interest her.
If she tries to flirt with you do not give in! Laugh it off and continue the conversation.

To mask this I would ask her a question that would set me up for a story about myself. ""what's your most embarrassing moment?"". For example. Then I will go into an entertaining story about mine, I'll work on my body language, voice, hand gestures, my vocal language and eye contact. But what I won't do is forget that I'm out for the selfish purpose of telling these girls my life story. 

At the end of these 3 weeks I had an unbelievable amount of material that I knew was either interesting or funny. I knew that girls don't bite and Infact love a good storyteller. I knew that I could keep a HB9/10's attention for 30-60min with my entire life's worth of silly stories. But most importantly I knew that I'd just spoken to loads of beautiful girls and nothing bad happened. Infact on a few occasions I'd actually rejected their advances. 

So I hope this works for you like it did for me. When you give yourself the permission to tell a girl anything you will realise just how interesting you really are.

1343069751.0,259,self.seduction,x12io,10 Mistakes I Made in College,312,53,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x12io/10_mistakes_i_made_in_college/,"After I graduated college 5 years ago, I realized that I could have done better. I came to a sad conclusion that I made multiple mistakes and could have taken more advantage of my collegiate, social opportunities. There were many times I could have performed better in my social and academic life. I don’t regret it, because it was a learning situation and took my time post-college to fix it all. I don’t want many of you to make the same mistake, so below is a list of the top 10 mistakes I made in college.


**1. Not Talking to Enough Girls**
I was in a fraternity and had options to talk to many girls. The only ones I talked to were the ones that I was introduced to. I never branched out and approached any girls on campus or in bars that I was interested in. I went to a college with over 40,000 students, which means there were about 20,000 were girls. I did not take advantage of that and I should have, EVERY SINGLE DAY. Instead I complained about not being able to meet new ones and didn’t taking any action.


**2. Going to the Same Bars**
My friends went to the same bars every single weekend. Of course, I followed along with everyone else because I didn’t want to “miss out”. Unfortunately I was missing out on a million other cool bars and places in my college. There were so many more girls to meet, but I decided to stick around the same areas and talk to the same people. Senior year I got fed up with this and started going to a few new spots, to realize I was missing out this entire time!


**3. Skipping Class**
I would skip class at least 1-2 times a week. Luckily, it didn’t affect my grades too much because I tortured myself and crammed last minute for every paper and test. This was beyond stressful. If I regularly attended class, then I wouldn’t have to have so many nights where I freaked out and had to pull all-nighters. 


**4. Not Making More Friends in My Classes**
The classes that I did attend, I kept to myself. I didn’t care to meet any new girls or make other guy friends. I kept to myself and stormed out as soon as the class was over. There were a ton of cute girls in my class, but I was either too afraid or lazy to spark up a conversation. Class is an easy way to get in with new, interesting people and it’s important to take advantage of that.


**5. Getting a Girlfriend Too Quick**
Lucky for me it only lasted 3 months, but I got a girlfriend the first week of college. This is a major mistake. The whole point of college is to experience as much as you can. It’s not to get settled down into a serious relationship. Hey, if it happens, it happens. But, my advice to you is not to go on a hunt for it. College is the time for experiencing multiple girls and making strong bonds with your friends. Don’t let anything take you away from that.


**6. Not Talking to Women I Was Attracted To**
There were so many hot girls that came around and I had easy opportunities to flirt with them or at least make friends with them. Instead, I had a pre-conceived notion that these girls were “bitches” or only liked to talk to jocks. Boy was I wrong. A lot of them were quality girls and I just stood in the corner watching everyone else mingle with them. I had no proof of any of my thoughts. I was just scared.


**7. Not Reading Enough**
There is a lot of downtime in college. Instead of picking up a good book I would party or sleep. There’s nothing wrong with either of those (especially in college) but it would have been good to pick up a new book every once in awhile. I don’t mean your course books either, but a classic novel or a how-to book. I would have learned a lot more and opened up my mind if I decided to delve into some solid books, but unfortunately, I was too lazy.


**8. Not Wearing a Condom**
There were a number of times I did not wear a condom in college. This was a poor decision. I didn’t catch any STD’s or get a girl pregnant (luckily) but I easily could have. A lot of people make this mistake and for them, it turns out for the worse. Unless you know she’s on birth control (for a fact) and is healthy (for a fact) then make sure you wear a condom. Trust me on this.


**9. Drinking Too Much**
There was never a night out that I didn’t drink. Of course, this is completely normal for college, but I’ve realized I could have socialized better if I took it down a notch. After I graduated, I slowed down my drinking to one drink a night (if that) when I went out and I got more numbers and more dates. If I applied that same mentality to my college nights, I would have been more successful with women and woke up feeling healthier in the morning.


**10. Creating Bad Eating Habits**
Every day I ate fast food or unnatural, frozen dinners from the grocery store. While I luckily, didn’t gain a significant amount of weight, it still affected my overall mood. Many days I would consistently feel like shit and I blamed it on my homework load or drunken nights out. In reality, my issue was the unhealthy food I was constantly putting in my body. A more natural and balanced diet helps you stay focused, energetic, and happy. It was hard to change these habits post college, but with enough time I managed to do so.


If you are in college or about to enter, then take my mistakes and learn from them. I highly suggest you break out of your shell, socialize with everyone and start to create healthy habits for your future. Don’t worry, because you can still have fun at the same time. Remember, everything is better for you in moderation. 

**tl;dr** - don't miss any opportunities in college

I've lurked for a bit here - thought I would make my first post a contribution rather than a question.

There's a killer move I have used for years, and I never understood why it worked so well until I started reading the literature.  Now that I have done some reading, though, it makes perfect sense.  To all the nerdy guys out there who are terrified of approaching, but can have a decent conversation once the ice is broken: this is my gift to you.  Trust me, this is gold.  (But there is one condition - don't let this become a crutch.  Grab your balls and learn to approach as well.)

The move?  Read a book at the bar.  Seriously.  It's magic. This one move has gotten me more ass than a donkey farm over the years. 

It seems bizarre at first - no one was more surprised than I was when this got me laid over and over again, but I now understand why.

I started doing this with absolutely no concept of using it for pickup.  The simple truth is that, being a big nerd, my two favorite things in the world to do are reading books and drinking beer, so why not combine the two?

Here's the thing, though.  I have rarely been able to read for very long.  90% of the time, someone opens me when I do this, usually a woman, and often the hottest woman there.  (This works especially well with hot female bartenders - normally a very tough target).  

Try it.  You can thank me later.

BTW, like I said, I have a good idea as to why this works, but I'd love to hear other Sedditors' theories before I post it.  I'll add my explanation after I get some responses.

I was out, not sarging or anything, just out in a crowded public area in the afternoon.  Out of nowhere, this 10 walks by, just sexied all the way up.  Tight leather dress, high heels, bright red lipsticks, the works.  So sexy that she just kind of looked out of place.  Which I found to be a bit comical.  

I was wondering why she was dressed as such in the middle of the afternoon.  Then I realized that probably her worst fear would be meeting some guy that absolutely did not care how sexy she was. Or a guy that could see straight through the iron wall of sexiness she built around herself and didn't like what he found inside.  What this revealed to me is that most other people, particularly women (just because society emphasizes their physical appearance more than men) are usually too worried about their own insecurities to think about somebody else's.  The whole time I was looking inside at my own faults and trying to fix them without even realizing that everybody was completely blinded by theirs.  

Instantly I relaxed and was able to just enjoy myself being outside.  That evening, it was easier for me to approach in bars and talk to people than it ever had been.  I would just keep in mind that I could do or say whatever and people would probably take it for confidence.  It was one of the most fun nights of bar hopping ever.  I wasn't thinking about game or approach or sets.  I was legitimately just trying to engage people in conversation.

1370132483.0,251,self.seduction,1fhqtc,"My most unparalleled confidence boost around girls? Living in a co-ed house at college. It's a crash course on how to be comfortable around girls, and blurs the line between hanging with guys, hanging with girls as friends, and meeting girls.",345,94,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fhqtc/my_most_unparalleled_confidence_boost_around/,"I spent two years at the dorms before basically falling into a 10 person house (big I know), 6 girls and 4 guys, and it was the best year of my college experience. This is where I built the confidence to ""be myself"" around girls. In other words, I have the same level of comfort when talking with girls, as I have with my closest guy friends. Not only is it incredibly relieving to just talk and act without over thinking, but the conveyance of that genuine comfort and confidence is my number one reason for having success with girls. It took me a year of being constantly around girls (especially girls that I wasn't trying to hook up with, it's a great intermediate step to talking with girls you're actually interested in)


If you don't find yourself in the situation, try and hang out at a buddies place that is co-ed, and make yourself established there. There were always a couple houses of friends at my college that were co-ed, and if not, guy's girlfriends would always be hanging out, and their girlfriends would start hanging out there too. 


First of all, you're placed into a scenario where it's *expected* that you'll  be talking to several girls all the time, so you have every reason to chat with them, make jokes, and generally be yourself without much pressure. After a while, you start talking to them like you talk to your guy friends (maybe a little more censored), and you drop this dividing wall between talking with each gender. It becomes just ""making conversation"" instead of ""talking to a girl"". The biggest thing I noticed was that I always told goofy jokes around my guy friends, but never showed that side of myself to girls upon first meeting them, because I assumed it would be weird or something, but plenty of girls have equally weird senses of humor, and if you bomb a joke, so what? It's your roommate.


Seriously though about the joke part, I started telling a few random and quirky jokes or observations to my girl roommates, got them laughing like my guy friends would, which boosted my confidence to make more comments and jokes like that, and the confidence just built upon itself to where I'll drop a weird funny comment to a girl right when I meet her, and my body language and smile convey confidence to where they are already giggling before I make a punchline. Even if the joke bombs, I'll comment on it with the same confidence and *that* will get them laughing.


Secondly, although I don't recommend sleeping with each other (we all did it anyways, always casual, usually drunken, and nothing dramatic ever came of it), but girls have circles of their girlfriends, and they invite them over just like guys invite their buddies to come hang out and watch TV on the couch. Not only do these girls come to all of your parties, but more importantly, they come over just in the middle of a Tuesday and you're instantly introduced. The girls know you're not a creep (you're not a creep right?) because you live with their friend and girls talk... So you've already got a head start when it comes to them being receptive. And so what if you don't find them attractive? Chat them up anyways, they're probably still cool, and you'll be seeing them around a lot.


Third, when you host parties or especially go out to bars, you roll in with at least a handful of girls, and trust me, the other girls in the bar take immediate notice. You already know all these girls so you'll be playing pool together and cracking corny jokes, which makes you approachable.


Pitfalls:


Taking sides on girls arguments. It totally happens, and they totally will try and get a guy on their side because it's validating. Just don't do it. It's so easy to stay out of it, and you will never win by digging yourself into the drama.


Sleeping with the roommates or their friends, and being careless about it. Realize that if you sleep with their friend, you will see them again, usually at every single party in the future. We still proceeded with caution, met a lot of great girls (couple girlfriends between all of us, mostly hookups at parties). I finally learned (took me 20 years) that honesty is a get-out-jail-free card in 95% of situations with girls (guys too). Sometimes they'll be pissed still, but you build a reputation of being an honest guy and *that* goes around when girls talk too.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1370132857.0,,,True,t3_1fhqtc,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fhqtc/my_most_unparalleled_confidence_boost_around/,
1366391093.0,250,self.seduction,1conyd,"Listen to Her Actions, not Her Words",339,89,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1conyd/listen_to_her_actions_not_her_words/,"All the time I see guys get themselves into bad positions with women. They turn into the guy who’s constantly asking a girl out for a date and she’s constantly saying no. They get into relationships where the girl is acting badly but he’s powerless to stop her bad behavior. Part of the problem here is that men tend to be straightforward. They take her words at face value. They don't understanding the difference between *implicit* and *explicit* communication.

You go out on a date with a girl. The next day, you send her a text. But she’s already decided she’s not into you. Explicit communication would be if she texted you back something like, ""I don't think we're a match,"" or ""I'm getting a friendship vibe from you."" She *explicitly* told you how she feels. Implicit communication would be if she simply didn’t text you back at all. She is communicating to you that she’s not interested but she’s not explicitly telling you she isn’t interested. Explicit communicate is typically verbal and straightforward where as with implicit communication she's sending a message based on action rather than the surface meaning of the words.

When I wasn’t so skilled socially, I had a hard time with implicit communication. It bothered me that people didn’t explicitly communicate because I had trouble reading that communication. In situations like these, I would often continue to invest in the girl even though she wasn’t interested. I wasn’t a stalker but it I didn’t know when enough was enough. It upset me that people couldn’t simply tell the truth and be up front when they were or weren’t interested.

**The Key to Staying Empowered in Relationships**

Once you start to get into relationships, implicit versus explicit communication becomes even more important. Much of modern dating advice goes astray over and over in the same exact way. Your partner does something inappropriate, something bad happens, or some other issue comes up and the first word of advice is always: Have a talk about it. This is explicit communication. 

If there is a sitcom-style misunderstanding in the relationship, having a talk can work. But typically—90% of the time—explicit communication doesn’t solve anything. In fact it only serves to make the problem worse. 

Let’s say you’re dating a girl. You're unhappy because she's flirting with other guys while out on dates with you. If you chose the route of explicit communication, you would have a 'talk' with her about flirting with other guys in front of you. 

The problem here is that as you are explicitly communicating with her about what you like and don’t like, you are implicitly communicating something very different. You are communicating to her that when she does something disrespectful, you open up more communication with her. You share your feelings and become more vulnerable. You add to your disempowerment by opening up and sharing your feelings with her. 

Alternatively, you can use implicit communication to communicate with her. When she’s acting inappropriate, you pull away. You take your attention away from her for a period of time. You may even cut the date short, as a signal to her that her actions are inappropriate. 

Implicit communication tends to be more powerful than explicit communication because you're *taking action*. You’re showing her that you will walk away if her bad behavior continues. She sees that she’s losing you and has to make a change if she is going to continue to be with you.

**Implicit Communication is the Most Honest**

While implicit communication seems complicated, once you start to look at what’s going on underneath, it’s really quite simple. Almost all implicit communication in relationships is binary. It’s either a Yes or No. You’re either rewarding her for doing good or pushing her away for doing bad. Implicit communication starts with the idea that you’re the prize, that you’re valuable in the relationship and if she wants more, she needs to act appropriately.

Once you learn the difference between implicit and explicit communication, you can start to read between the lines and see what’s really going on in your relationships with women. You start to realize that people's words are fairly worthless and you listen to their actions instead. That's really the only true honest signal you get from people.

A girl at a bar walks by and says to you, ""That’s the ugliest shirt I’ve ever seen in my life. Terrible."" The explicit communication is that she doesn't like something about you. But the implicit communication is that she likes you because she would not have started talking with you in the first place if she didn’t like  you. She’s flirting--perhaps badly--but she’s interested in conversation.

Likewise, you may text a girl and she's very responsive. She's friendly and fun and totally up for chatting. But every time you invite her to meet up, she's busy. Explicitly, she's saying Yes. She's friendly and positive. But implicitly, she's saying No because she won't hang out with you. Until she acts otherwise, you need to proceed like it's a No or else you will invest too much time and energy into a lost cause. Watch her actions, not her words.

I would consider myself attractive, but I have had a girlfriend most of my life (Teens to 20.) Also, much of this time, whenever I happened to have a girlfriend, they seemed to ""fall into my lap"" without much gaming involved. After years of this, and realizing that I am no better at talking to girls than the AFC, I decided to change. I dumped my girlfriend, I read ""The Game"", followed Cajun and Mark Sparks religiously, and started nursing school.
Now as you can imagine, starting nursing school, my entire mindset was **""I'M GOING TO BE SURROUNDED BY GIRLS I'M GOING TO NON-STOP GET LAID""**
Boy was I ever wrong.
I don't think I spoke with a single girl the entire semester. Instead, I would go home after class and just text ex girlfriends. You can imagine the frustration. After a semester of this I had an epiphany. I walked in on the first day of class and talked to EVERYONE. Now being only one of the two males in my class, there are girls everywhere. THEIR RESPONSE WAS AMAZING. I felt like a god. Just from initiating these conversations I was getting dates, girls touching my legs under tables, and twice had some of the milfs in my class saying they would fuck me if they were 15 years younger. **ALL FROM INITIATING CONVERSATION**.
Fast forward a couple years and I feel as though I have mastered this. Everywhere I go to attempt to pick up woman.. I just say ""Hi."" Openers are bullshit in my opinion, walk up, stand up straight, look them in the eyes, and say ""Hi"" with a smirk on your face. There is nothing that works better. Amongst all of the nurses I work with, they all call me a player and I still am able to fuck any of them I choose. 
I have learned woman just are attracted to someone who can engage them.. with anything. They love talking, emotion, and just being yourself. So when they always say just approach... **JUST DO IT.** You will get no where reading all the books and posts under the sun unless you go out and approach, it's that simple.
Be that guy who is talkative and friendly. Your life will change.

It's just a Thursday night in college and has some advice that anybody in any casual situation can utilize.

Last night was a fairly typical night for me. I texted around to my different social circles and had a few party options. I picked the one that sounded most promising and headed over around 10 o clock after a glass of scotch (This is the only alcohol I allow myself, I no longer drink at parties). I got to the party and did a couple of warm up sets. I find that often I need to socially recalibrate after studying for so long. 

At this time I spotted one of the girls I had invited. Previously I had friendzoned her and turned her into a great resource. Not only does she socially proof me (because she's hot) but she wings me in set occasionally. She tells me she brought a friend of hers, I notice the friend off to the side and it's on. 

I opened with the GREATEST OPENER EVER. **""Hey who are you""** it never fails! I steered the conversation in a couple of different directions, constantly bringing up new shit and just generally talking a whole lot of shit. I've come to realize that the conversation itself doesnt matter much, but the emotions you convey in your speech are vital. I would tell her how much I loved something, and then point to a dude at the party and be like ""oh man I fucking hate that guy"". My emotions were constantly changing and this way the conversation was never boring. 

After some pretty heavy kino and about 20 minutes of conversation I was beginning to get a bored. I could have kissed this girl 10 minutes earlier but building up the anticipation is a great tactic to ensure that a girl stays interested in you. I tell her exactly how I feel **""I'm getting a bit bored so i'm going to go talk to my friends, but I'm going to kiss you before I leave""**

I've really found this line to be a complete mindfuck for girls. Most AFCs when they make out with a girl will stick to her for the entire night, I kiss them (normally passionately) and then say ""Bye Sweetie"". They literally cannot comprehend what's going on because it just doesn't happen. 

This time she orbited around me as I ignored her for a while and then was like ""HEY HB8!!!!!!"" hows it going. She literally didn't even respond to me, she lunged for my face. I broke the kiss (always try to do this) and then led her out of the party back to my room. I didn't even have to give plausible deniability.

After I had sex with her, she was laying next to me and said something that inspired me to write this field report. ""You're the most confident and assured man I've ever seen, you honestly don't even look that good but you turn me on so much""

****
Lessons:

1. Be completely and utterly secure in yourself. Be honest, I was bored but I wanted to kiss the chick. So I told her so, and it worked! All of these tactics and other shit will bog down your mind when in reality all you have to do is be enough of a man to know what the hell you want. 

2. Make moves, see a girl you like? Go over, talk to her, put your arm around her after a little while, then after a while of conversation tell her that you're going to kiss her. Obviously there's some steps in-between but that's really the essence of a standard pickup for me. 

3. You don't always have to do crazy wild stupid shit to amaze a girl. Most of my success nowadays happens exactly like it did above. Be kind of chilled out, act like you have abundance, and then get laid.

1297062212.0,253,self.seduction,fgq0a,Approach Anxiety is a symptom of EXTREME selfishness and douchebaggery (KINDA LONG),333,80,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fgq0a/approach_anxiety_is_a_symptom_of_extreme/,"I suffered from extreme AA the entire first year I was sarging, and it took this epiphany for me to finally break out and get Anti-Approach Anxiety. Nowadays I get worried that if I DON'T approach a hot girl, some other PUA is gonna be nailing her to the kitchen counter on Valentine's Day- ain't gonna happen, guys!

Right now, if you're suffering from AA, your basic frame is almost certainly something like this: ""She's hot and gets hit on all the time, and I'll come off as awkward and the conversation would die off in 20 seconds and it's safer to just not approach"". Even if you don't actually think this to yourself every time, this type of basic attitude is the source of AA. So listen up:

Hot girls do get hit on all the time. 99/100, however, it is an awkward experience initiated by some chode with no game, making boring conversation, and not adding any excitement or value to her life at all. This is where shit tests and bitch shields come from (I know, I know, this is hardly groundbreaking stuff- hear me out).

SO. First off it's important to understand that WOMEN DO NOT MIND PEOPLE TALKING TO THEM. Seriously, women talk 100 times more than guys do. Listen to them gabbering right now. Talking is something all women love to do. Talking is easy. SO LISTEN UP: EVEN IF YOU HAVE A SUPER BORING CONVERSATION, THE **ABSOLUTE** WORST THING THAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT YOU WILL COME ACROSS LIKE A NORMAL GUY. Think about that. Normal guys are boring and awkward around hot women. So even if you crash and burn and are boring and awkward, YOU'RE NORMAL, CONGRATULATIONS. That's the WORST case scenario! Wrap your head around this concept, care for it, feed it, nurture it, ponder it and all of it's implications. You can do NO worse than normal. It's like someone giving you a test and saying, ""Oh by the way, the absolute lowest score possible is a C. You literally cannot, under any circumstances (other than burning the building down or slapping the teacher in the face with your dick) FAIL this test."" There will be NO pressure and NO anxiety once you actually, properly **I** **N** **C** **E** **P** **T** this idea into your consciousness. You're gonna like the way you approach and open; I guarantee it.

Second, when you walk past a hot girl without talking to her, you are being a selfish, unchivalrous douchebag because you are placing your own fears and wants above her needs. Women NEED you to improve their lives. They are DESPERATE for something exciting to happen. They silently BEG you every day to start a conversation and drop an atomic love bomb into their world. I'm not even kidding, ask ANY girl you know. Better yet, ask every girl you DON'T know. If you're trying to kick AA, go up to a hot chick tomorrow and just ask her, ""So when I see a cute girl out and about, I should absolutely go talk to her right? Girls all silently hope for a fun guy to spontaneously start talking to them, right?"" If someone produces a recording of them asking a stranger this question and the answer is anything other than ""YES"", I will PayPal that individual $100 dollars, provided that you keep the conversation going after that question and close the set. No shit.

Alright, I'm rambling here, and I'll probably come back and edit this in the morning to make it understandable, but for now, just remember:

1. Normal guys are boring and slightly awkward when talking to hot chicks, ergo...
2. Even if you are totally boring and awkward, the worst you can be is normal.
3. If you open girls and are even slightly interesting and fun, you will get their number and you will fuck real live female women.
4. NOT opening a girl means you are a selfish dick who wants to retain all the awesomeness in your life for just yourself.
5. All women want to be opened. 
6. For the love of GOD go outside and talk to girls.

Some time ago, and because of you guys, I started paying more attention to the things I did wrong when I relate to people. So the first thing I did was look directly into her eyes to make eye contact as soon as possible. There I was, fighting with myself to not look away for nothing in this world (even if my bus came at an inopportune moment). The girl was approaching more and finally visual contact was made. Her facial expression remained the same... she was getting closer... Then she entered the restaurant which is near the bus stop. However, for a split second I saw her smiling. ""I need to go there. I need to talk to her. Sure I would if my legs had not frozen and if I was not overthinking about this."" So I kept sitting, waiting for her to leave the restaurant for some reason. The universe answered my request and there she was on the street again and I realized she was looking at me with the corner of her eye. For unknown reasons (read: stupidity) I kept still. Then she came back and I kept thinking about what I would say if I were man enough. For the third time the girl came out, looked directly at me and gave one of the most beautiful smiles I've ever seen. Unfortunately my bus came and I never knew her name ... JUST KIDDING!

A wave of courage was born inside me and I finally got up to talk to her. Now I know her name, got her phone number and I'm waiting to get back from work tonight to call her.

Thanks, Seddit, for all the tips and advices.

Any comments?

i have been absent for one year, due to being in a relationship.
i broke up six weeks ago and am now slowly getting back into the game; so far 4 f-close, all nothing special except for one.


first date we were at a bar of her chosing and we talked about all sorts of stuff, nothing too interesting. we got to talking about shows we enjoy and she mentiones the naked man move from how i met your mother and says that it might work, depending on the guy. i didn't escalate anything there, it did not feel right.

the next day i was at her flat for some cooking (second date stuff) and after that we made out on her couch for what felt like forever.
she kept resisting all my attempts to undress her, but still acted horney as fuck. when i was in serious danger of getting blue balls, she got up to use the bathroom. i thought, ""fuck it, i'm gonna escalate it""

so i got naked, sat back on her couch. she came back and says; ""you're naked on my couch"" i say ""that's a brilliant observation"", get up, walk over to her and start making out again.

didn't take another two minutes to get to the bedroom.

has anyone tried it and what's your result? it's not something that i would do on every date, but there it felt like the thing to do.

*edit:* alright i get it, you don't believe me. a bit sad for me, because it is one of the funnest things i have done in pickup since i told a girl i am a professional blimp pilot. it was truly exhilarating and exciting. my heart was pounding through my chest, and i felt fucking alive!",Field Report,False,,t5_2qhrv,1355672075.0,frflair,,True,t3_14xtrj,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/14xtrj/fr_the_naked_man/,

Pick up secondary. ,306,52,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ybebi/get_your_priorities_straight_have_fun_primarily/,"This has been a monumental mindset change for me lately that has really changed the way I conduct myself. 

An example of this happened the other night. 

Went out, met an HB8 in the club. Was having a bit of a chat and some fun banter teasing her, we dance and I'm having fun, I'm escalating kino and having fun, I isolate her and take her out to the lounge area... still having fun. I build up the attraction with sexual conversation and K close.. still having fun. She starts to talk... a lot... about serious things.. I'm in a party mood.... I'm getting kinda bored... The girl is totally into me and when her friends go to leave she tells them she's staying. I'm not really having as much fun with her by this point and am left with 2 options. 

1. keep hanging out with the girl, put up with the slight boredom, most likely take her home and F close her for the sake of it cos she's hot. 

2. Grab her number, tell her I have to find my friends and that I'll see her later, and go find an interaction that entertains me again. 

I decide to go with option 2. Up until very recently I would have gone with option 1. 

I like to practice my game and pick up girls because it's fun, because I like meeting exciting new people, and because sex is awesome. I do it because it's fun. My entertainment comes first. If a girl is no longer entertaining me then I will now move on and find an interaction that is entertaining. I'll entertain myself by entertaining her and challenging myself to get her attention and interest, but if she's a boring person, then next. 

It may sound pretty obvious, but has been a pretty big revelation to me and I just thought I'd share. 

The flipside of that too is that the girl was amazed that I would just leave after we had built so much attraction, and she texted me the next day and wanted to meet up.

1317494651.0,255,self.seduction,kxo1j,Quick date tip: People watch other couples at the bar/restaurant. Make comments. Girls eat this up.,334,79,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/kxo1j/quick_date_tip_people_watch_other_couples_at_the/,"I have a regular spot for going on first dates. It's a very nice lounge with a nice bar and tables. I split an appetizer and buy some drinks with the girl. Always have a good time. 

When seated I always start commenting on other couples at the bar/other tables. I will usually give them names and start a running commentary throughout the night. Like, ""Dane cook and shakira might have something there.. woow, did you see him lightly pet her arm? dane on the offensive!"" I can't tell you how much fun I've had with this line of talk. By the end of the night, sometimes the entire conversation centers about resolving whether or not our couples are going to have sex. (edit: you can also start talking about the type of sex the two would have; the funnier and more outlandish the better!)

You can kino the hell out of the girl with this technique by mimic'ing what the couples are doing. Last time, there was this crazy pickup by this cougar on a young man. She was stroking his neck and I was like, ""woow, does that really work? [I begin stroking her neck; she laughs but is totally into it]"". Then the cougar girl whispered in the guys ear and they both walked out. My date says, ""she must have said, 'hey baby, let's get out of here and go to my place'. At the end of the night, I said the same thing.. hahaha. Guess who got laid? :) The time before, I said, ""woow, what would people say about us? Am I having success""? I don't remember her response but 10 seconds later we are making out.

Anyways, this shit is golden. Very easy to turn the conversation to sex and build attraction. Combined with kino (you are sitting next to her, right? never across) it's very powerful.

Don't ask, don't be a bitch. Just do it. Your mind is racing, and terrified because your blood is not flowing. We over think, because we want to be right. We over think, because we want the truth.

In social scenarios I'd over think everything. Each and every individual's posture, who they were paying attention too; basically EVERY FUCKING THING. And I'd analyse, ala Sherlock Holmes, their motivations. I'd predict multiple ones, with different backstories (because, I am a creative fucking genius). BUT I WAS A FUCKING SLOW LETHARGIC  PUSSY.

You're smart, right? Well why the fuck is figuring shit out so hard? I'm telling you, get fit.

Let your body, reflect your mind.

Victory, throughout history has ALWAYS been decided by the fastest and the smartest. The brains to calculate, to plan, to predict, to rationalise, and to analyse. Speed, to do ALL those things; but also speed to enact them.

A healthy body will allow you to live on less sleep. That translates into MORE TIME, with your brain active.

All you have to do is keep getting fit; and keep building.

You're smart, so fucking act like it.

What do you want?

Well, with your brilliant fucking mind, and slowly growing health, figure it the fuck out; and start building for it.

One day at a time, never slow down.

We are the Alpha and the Omega.

We will laugh and we will love.

We will scorn and we will fight.

We are driven by purpose.

1360797935.0,252,self.seduction,18h65c,[FR] report from the other side- girl meeting a PUA,313,61,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/18h65c/fr_report_from_the_other_side_girl_meeting_a_pua/,"Hi seddit, I don't know if this is standard practice but as a girl who met an interesting guy who used game on me last weekend I thought it might be useful to others to read about what happened.

Situation: I was on a night out with my friends, I was hit on twice by guys whose approach was basically, come up to me and slur drunkenly in my ear as I tried to politely distance myself. I got smacked on the ass by one of them and my friend intervened. It was getting late and I was stood with a male friend (the boyfriend of my best friend), lets call him Tom.

The opener: so, Gameboy (as I call him) came up to me and Tom, and asked us about our costumes (it was animal fancy dress). He mentions Tom's monkey costume then turns to me, looks me up and down, and says 'so you came as a caterpillar, huh? that's awesome, I love caterpillars, I used to keep them in jars when I was a kid.' I was dressed as a leopard, so he was obviously messing with me...but for some reason I felt the need to defend myself and say 'I'm a leopard!' This is really different from the standard way guys approach me- I guess I usually have my 'bitch shield' up to stop random people but he was very confident and made me and Tom laugh and I felt like I needed to qualify myself to him. He also spent time talking to Tom and asking him questions which again was not normal. 

In my head I was thinking 'hmm if he was a PUA this would be really great stuff, the opener, disqualifying the girl you're interested in, negging her, etc.' Then he said he would bet me that I couldn't lie five times- he would ask me five questions, and I'd have to lie to all of them. If I lost, I'd buy him a shot- if I won, he'd buy the shots. At this point it was confirmed for me that he was in fact 'gaming' me and I was too flustered by this to agree to the bet because all I could think of was how he would react if I asked him about it, so he asked Tom instead. Tom lost and went to the bar to get the shots. Gameboy hooked his arm through mine and said 'come on, we're going too' and we went to the bar. He had figured out by that time that me and Tom weren't together.

I can't remember exactly how I phrased it but I said something like, have you read the game? The pick up artist stuff? And he just blinked and then went 'YES! That's an amazing book, you know, it's so interesting. Have you read it? That's crazy, I didn't think anyone would ever call me out on it.' So I told him that I hadn't actually read that book but I read a lot on the reddit seduction community and I'm interested in it. I was kind of relieved that he hadn't reacted badly, or made it awkward, and he was expressing interest in how I knew about this stuff, and made it seem like we had something to talk about, so we went to sit down after the shots. I asked if reading the book had changed a lot in his life and he said that it'd made a difference for him at work, mostly. I could see it in play with things like: my other friend was sat behind him, also dressed as a monkey, and he made me laugh while Gameboy was speaking. I apologised and said that I wasn't laughing at him, but the monkey was distracting me. Gameboy turned around and said 'well how can I compete with that?!' and congratulated the guy on his outfit, asked him a few questions, introduced himself, etc. It just struck me how confident he was because usually in that situation I think guys would just try too hard to get my attention back to them, or sulk or something. But he made friends with everyone. 

At the end of the night I had to go with my friends and he said 'well this can end two ways, you can give me your number and I'll call you up and we'll go out for a date, or you don't, and we don't see each other again.' So very willingly I gave him my number, and he did call, and we are going out this Friday.

I wanted to write this field report because it really impressed me the first time I really noticed a guy using game. I'm used to being much more in control of social interactions, and dismissing guys ( in my defense, drunkenly mumbling at me is not attractive). I think every guy should learn more about this to improve their confidence and the way they talk to women. He is attractive and funny but if he'd just blatantly hit on me I would've dismissed him as a creep, or too desperate. But I am actually really impressed.

TL:DR at bottom

[FR] Me (M/21) at friend's house getting ready for a gig (I'm a musician), when another friend of mine (F/21, not interested) calls and tell me she's going to the show (it's a bar) I'm about to play.  Sweet.  Went to the show, we played first, killed it.  Get two free drink tickets for playing there, saving that shit.  See my friend that called, go to say hi.  She points out a girl HB10 with a purse she likes, but I look to her right, holy shit, flawless HB10 right next to her.  Just played a kickass show, so I'm totally in state.  Sit next to her, order a water from the bartender, and he starts talking about getting me back to play more shows here because he loved us (I'm not actually in the band, I just subbed in).  Told him we'd love to come back, bro'd with the guy right in front of her.  Turn to her, look into her eyes deeply for a second, then:

* Me: Hi.
* Her: Hey, nice job up there!
* Me: Thanks, it was a lot of fun.
* Her: So, what's up?
* Me: Oh, nothing.  I just thought you were beautiful, so I came to talk to you.

Totally confident, smiling, and everything.  Her face said attraction, but...

* Her: I have a boyfriend.
* Me: Is it a girl of equal or greater attractiveness?
* Her: (laughing pretty hard) No, it's a guy.  But, if I didn't, you would have been **so** in.

That took me by surprise.  She says that nobody has ever had the balls to approach her like that.  I ask what she meant by ""in"".  She says she probably would have ended up going home with me that night.

* Note: NOT a typical reaction.  I usually get a good reaction from that opener, because it's honest, but that's the first time it's ever worked anywhere near that well.

Boyfriend comes, introduces himself, chill guy.  I get ready to eject, when she says she wants me to meet a friend of hers.  She turns around, it's the HB10 that my friend pointed out earlier.  Sweet.  We all start talking as a group I proceed to kino, she responds really quickly with overt kino on ME.  Keep that going about 5 more minutes to build some tension.  I nudge the dude while the girls are whispering something, ask him to help me isolate her.  He's got an idea.  He whispers something in his girl's ear, she starts giggling and suddenly says she needs some air.  Those two leave, My target watches them go, then turns to face me.  Sexual tension: ridiculous levels.

* Her: So how are you feeling right now?
* Me: Well, I'll feel pretty damn good after this.

Lean in quickly for kiss, she read my mind.  Tried pulling away after a quick kiss, she's not having that.  We make out for a few minutes, guy and girl come back.  They ask what we were doing, and I tell them, which makes my girl blush.  They say they want to leave, my girl says give us 20 minutes.  She takes me to a secluded table, we make out, I touch her, she touches me, we get nasty.  20 minutes is done and we're both out of breath and sweating.  I tell her to order me a beer, and to get her self whatever she wants, hand her the tickets.  She comes back with the drinks, and a piece of paper.  She gives me another kiss, drinks her shot that she ordered, and says goodbye.  The paper has her #, name, and says: ""Call me for another unforgettable night. &lt;3"" 

Sweet.

**TL:DR  Opened a HB10 with a boyfriend, but I was so confident and honest that she introduced me to her friend HB10, and me and that girl had some sexytimes.  End with #-, K-, and half of a F-close.**

Being told to be confident is entirely different from *being* confident. Real confidence can't be faked, and it only comes as a result of **doing things**. Here on Seddit we talk a lot about the abstract concept of being confident, but if you're like most of us, you'd prefer concrete instructions. So here they are:

 * If you're self-conscious about your body, *do something* about it! Join a gym, consult a trainer, and start exercising three times a week. Set a fitness goal, make a plan to get there, and stick to the plan.
 * Buy some decent clothes. Go to to a boutique store like Express Men or Banana Republic. Invest some money in fitted clothes. They'll make you instantly feel more attractive.
 * Get a hair cut! Pay attention to your grooming.
 * Join a Meetup group and start going to meetups
 * Volunteer for charity at your local church, soup kitchen, animal shelter, etc.
 * Take dance classes such as salsa, swing, hip hop, or ballroom.
 * Take improv classes
 * Go speed dating
 * Approach dozens of women. Go out regularly and set a goal to approach at least three women every time you go out.
 * Perform on stage. It could be dance, improv, a play, open mic stand-up, poetry night, or whatever. It's terrifying but you'll feel soo much better afterwards.

If you go out and do these things, you'll notice your confidence skyrocketing when you talk to strangers. You'll spend less time worrying about whether she likes you and more time trying to decide if you like her.

Throughout our time at the park, we were just discussing a lot of things in our lives and our passions. It just all flowed so well. The best thing I have ever done happened towards the end of our day.

We were walking and talking when all of a sudden...neither of us talked. We just kept walking. She asked me...""What are you thinking right now?"" ...I stopped walking, looked into her eyes and said ""Would you like me to show you or tell you?"" ...she replied ""Surprise me""

At that very moment, I stepped in and kissed her. I felt as if the world had stopped. It was just us two. It was our first kiss.

I'm a first-year in university, and there was a girl in my class who I'd been crushing on pretty hard, HB7. I'd never made a move on her but I'd noticed her looking at me a few times. After one of my classes, a friend of mine went up to talk to her, and I figured this was the best chance I'd get to introduce myself. I went over and said hi, asked how she knew my friend, and it turns out she lives in the same building as us (our university halls are huge). They were about to head home and I decided to tag along. 

The walk isn't too long, only about 10 minutes so I knew I had to act reasonably fast. I started talking to her, and asking her simple questions like her name and how we'd never met up until now. She was really responsive, smiling and giving me good vibes in general. By the time we got near our halls, my friend had left so it was just the two of us. I could tell this girl was into me, and from a past experience I wasn't about to fuck this up. Usually I would have just said bye, and waited for another chance like this to move forward, but I'd discovered seddit the week prior, and decided to do something about it. We were at the door of her building, she laughed at something I said and I told her ""You have the cutest laugh, you know that?"". She seemed like a shy girl so I didn't think she got compliments like that often, and I had to make it clear I was interested in her, and not just to be friends. All this time I wasn't breaking eye contact either. I took my phone out and told her we should definitely hang out again after class some time, and asked for her number. She seemed more than happy to oblige, I gave her a hug and we parted ways.

Cue the next day, our classes finish at midday so I figured it was the perfect time to hang out since we'd have plenty of time. I sent her a text asking if she wants to get something to eat, she says yes and we meet outside. I had an idea that having a date in the park would be one of the best ways to really get  comfortable with each other so I suggest we get some food and eat it there. On the walk over there we're continuously talking. I'm not the best at making conversation, so it was mainly just asking questions back and forth, but I think because I was kino-ing her throughout and the fact that we were into each other canceled out the awkwardness that you would usually get from such a line of conversation. I noticed that she also started kino-ing me, and got me to touch her by saying stuff like ""My hair is so messy today, seriously try touching it"". It was really easy to get physical cause of little stuff like this. 

We get to the park, find a nice spot in the shade, sit down and finish our food. I think it's a pretty good time to start playing the questions game with her (the one where we ask each other personal shit). I had a feeling she was a virgin (same as me!), so I went in with that frame of mind for my questions. We already knew quite a bit about each other but nothing about our romantic lives so I asked her how much she'd done with guys in the past, and she said nothing major. I gave her a little shit for it and asked how that was even possible. She brushed it off and didn't really say anything, but it was cute anyway. It got to the point where she asked me how many girlfriends I'd had. I told her 0, but I'd still done stuff with girls before. She asks ""like what?"", and I tell her to close her eyes if she really wants to find out. She complies and I go in and we start making out. She was surprisingly good and we literally sat there making out for like 20 minutes. I did that thing I read on here where you tug on the back of her scalp and kiss her neck, which she reeeally seemed to dig. 

I tell her I wanna go back to her room, and so does she, so we pack up our shit, walk home and go to her room. The rest is pretty much history. There's not much else to say really in terms of seduction, I think the fact we were both virgins at 19 and had gotten on together really well was the crux of it. I was insanely horny by the time I got back to her room and so was she. I'm just surprised at how easy it was, and how much I would have missed out on this if it wasn't for reading some of the basic stuff I found on here.

1328024169.0,252,self.seduction,p4mkr,"I found seddit 18 months ago. I've learnt a lot since then. Here are some hopefully unique thoughts, warnings and tips for intermediate users.",309,57,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/p4mkr/i_found_seddit_18_months_ago_ive_learnt_a_lot/,"I thought I had reached ""max-level"" long ago.

I've been here for 18+ months. 1 month in I had transformed my behaviour around women for the better, lowered AA, didn't fail shit-tests, KINO EYES SMILE. 2-3 months in I had it near perfected, and knew what I should be doing most of the time. My behaviour overall since then isn't too different to how it was at that point. Yet I have made so many mistakes and learnt from them - the subtleties of what I do in each situation have adapted. I know certain things I should not say, and catch certain subtle long-term tests/games that I would have fallen for 16 months ago. BUT my overall behaviour is still the same, and when something goes wrong I still feel like that guy from 16 months ago. I'm not though - the number of mistakes I've learnt not to make has increased from 10 to about 2000.

*We can never be perfect at this.*

Please dont just skim that last line! For 18 months I've thought we could reach that plateu where all situations have an answer. If you see somebody reach perfection in the field then all it means is that they have reached a mastery in that niche environment. They are like a bee who found a massive flower and is making tonnes of sweet honey from it. Good on them. It is a skill to be able to have a high success rate of picking up bitchy but hot girls in up-town bars. It is also impressive to hit on intelligent women and make them feel smarter. **But don't rely on any one thing all the time**. The bee may one day get bored of that flower, or have the flower taken away from it, and need to move on. When that time comes it may have no idea where to go. There are risks to sticking to one niche.

Many of you may be here for self-improvement more than for getting sex. I know I was/am. Make sure you challenge yourself with new environments, and don't let it get stale. Get phone numbers in places you normally wouldn't. Date weird girls / dangerous / bitchy girls just for the hell of it, because you want to learn from them, and tell them that they are providing value for you in that way (they will appreciate and respect you for it). **Dating girls you know you do not wish to marry** (or even have a medium term relationship) is one of the best things you can do for your social intelligence and learning, and yet so few men bother (""nice guys"" are the worst for this).

If you are young (hell, even if you are old) then you need to be learning! To **maximise the amount you learn** put yourself in radically different enviroments (read ""The Lean Startup"" - its about entreprenuers who caused a paradigm shift in new product development by deliberately putting themselves in environments/tests where they expected to fail. Most of the time they did fail, but the few times they got small successes they learnt far more than they would have if they did something with an 80% chance of succeeding). Do stupid things and learn from the 10% of the time it gets you laid. *Apocalypse openers are just the beginning*. 

**A warning**: As I've ""improved"" I have become less interested in women as a whole. A one night stand with an 'HB9' was something I would dream about from age 12 until a year ago. I no longer get much from it (except if I have not had sex in multiple weeks, and then it fills a physical need). Its a weakness that hurts to admit: I often get more from peers seeing / knowing of the one night stand and 'respecting' it than I do from the actual night (I still try to keep it private/secret though). Lack of sleep prevents a day of work and impacts on long-term goals. Short term relationships feel like a toxic energy sap, taking me away from more fruitful ambitions. I like the slight learning experience of a one-night stand though - the differences girls have in bed can be stark. Make sure you push learning boundaries and be rough with them - see how rough you can go before they make you stop. Learn!

The phrase ""Not giving a fuck"" gets thrown around a lot here. Often somebody would say they stopped caring and approached a girl. Thats great, but you are only at the first step! Maximise your learning and generate some anecdotes. Make up a fake personality for the night. Dance on stage at a gig and drag others up with you. A night out is a total waste of time if you didn't do something that would make you remember it in the months to come. If you are used to pulling girls then dont just do that. Whats the point? Aim for that threesome you want to brag about. Even if you don't then the night becomes ""that night I did all those stupid things for a threesome!"". 

On a night out and already confident / good at this stuff? Getting slapped doesn't hurt. The last few one night stands I've had slapped me before sleeping with me. Its a non verbal shittest used only by the slightly more bitchy HB8+s (they also have higher probability of DTF). If you pass it then you break many future barriers and show a lot of confidence and dominance, and things are on easy street. Don't be hurtful or a dick to get slapped though, and understand that some girls do get upset. If she is upset you did it wrong, apologise, give her space, leave. If she is a little angry then you are likely doing it right.

**Another warning**: Caring less about what others think (about you) has its costs as well as its benefits. Suddenly I have to put mental effort into making sure some friends are not offended (e.g. I non-flirtingly tell their girlfriend she looks pretty today), or I have to put mental effort to make sure I don't ignore them when they are upset. I know that I am providing to them more than they will be able to give back to me, as I do not need them to resolve my issues. Again, the limited energy I have in a day is expended on things that I know will not ever shell out rewards of equal weight. I have discovered why the alpha male stereotype is often depicted as lonely - though sometimes it is a character flaw and he hates himself or cant express some things, he may also just have given up on expending the time and energy of helping everyone else without expecting anything in return. But continuing to help out those that rely on you is what makes you a better person, and isn't that why you searched for and found seddit in the first place?

I have lots more to say, and will if this post gets attention. **edit: Lots of good stuff and even some debate in the comments right now.**

1325013872.0,248,self.seduction,nskft,"[FR] Date + lay, learned about what makes a good date",382,134,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/nskft/fr_date_lay_learned_about_what_makes_a_good_date/,"I had a date yesterday that went really well, ended up staying over at her place and had sex twice.

I learned a TON from this, and I think some of it might be useful.

I haven't been on many dates. I'm more of a same-night lay sort of guy. To be honest, dates actually frighten me. So much of my AFC dating in the past was awful and anxiety-ridden, so I actually avoided standard dating.

This one went well. Here's what I did to make it happen: I had a general plan of how it would go that wasn't too specific. I met her near where she lives -- this is crucial, it allows you somewhere to go later. I picked a starbucks in the middle of a promenade-style area. Gives us an obvious way to start the date, with the option of open-ended walking around checking stuff out.

**First lesson: Have a plan, assume you'll lead, but also be flexible.**

After starbucks, I thought we would walk around. Turned out, she was hungry and suggested a bar with food. Right on! Happy to oblige. If I had tried to go along with my original plan, it would've been weird.

**Second lesson: Take responsibility for moving the date forward, and do it before a venue feels ""stale.""**

I had good instincts both times. I moved us out of starbucks at a good time. And moved us out of the bar at a good time. By good time, I mean we were chatting, having fun, feeling good, and right as the conversation hit a natural transition point, I suggested we go. I didn't wait until the venue became boring. And I didn't wait for her to do it.

**Third lesson: Start touching early, keep it going. Don't worry if she's not doing it back as much!**

I gave her a hug the second we met up. Throughout Starbucks and the bar, I did ""friendly"" non-sexual touching. I was really diggin on her, so I wanted to touch her more. However, I was careful to be respectful as we were in public. The most I did was ""romantic"" touching, like touching her lower back or holding hands. I waited until we were alone to ramp it up.

She didn't kino me back very much. For every five I did, she did one. But that's okay! What's important is she received touching well. Again, we're the men, we have to lead.

**Third-and-a-half lesson: Be comfortable and keep the conversation going.**

Some girls are chatty, some girls are shy. If you're with a shy girl, just fucking talk. It doesn't need to be profound. Say something fun, tell a fun story. Wait a second for her to chime in. If she doesn't, ask her a fun question. That's it! You can use silence to test her -- does she take some responsibility for the conversation by reinitiating? My girl did... and I took this as a sign of interest.

**Fourth lesson: Watch a movie. ""Let's watch a movie"" is the ""let's go fuck"" of our time. Use it!**

Women are horny! If you've been having fun, chatting, touching, and giving her some sexual looks, she'll probably want you. Ask to isolate. There's a good chance she'll say yes. ""Watching a movie"" is awesome because it gives her an innocent excuse to be alone with you. It's not Don frickin Juan but it works.

**Fifth lesson: pick a movie that you both have seen and is light and funny. That way it's okay to talk over it.**

**Sixth lesson: once you're alone, just start escalating.**

Again, you don't have to be Don Juan. Just sit next to her on the couch or whatever, pull her over. Watch a bit of the movie, chat, laugh, and when you want to, just kiss her. It's so simple: pick a moment when you're both laughing and looking at each other, then go in for it.

**Seventh lesson: get sexual.**

When I was younger, I couldn't figure out how to go from making out to other stuff. I'd just sit there and make out for way too long.

There are ways to make kissing sexual, I suggest you do them. Stuff like: biting the earlobe, kissing the neck, grab a fistful of hair near the roots, rub your hand up and down her side, etc. Don't delay on this stuff. A natural and fun progression can be, 2-3 closed lip kisses, then some tongue, then start running your hand along her side.

**Eighth lesson: to defeat last minute resistance, just keep going.**

When I went to take her top off, she blanched and stopped me. I didn't argue, I agreed, was totally chill, and just kept the sexual kissing and touching. I noticed again, she started getting horny. So I went for it again. Totally worked.

Just keep trying. You can literally watch a girl's resistance slowly erode.

Edit: thanks to generalmishap, I realized I can be more clear here.

*I do not advocate pushing a girl to do stuff she's not comfortable with!* When she stopped me, I backed off! I went back to the things that she was okay with.

Super importantly, the whole time we were making out and sexual touching, I was paying VERY CLOSE ATTENTION to her. Things like, how was she touching me back? Did her breathing rate change? What noises did she make

You can often tell when your girl is getting horny. Once I could obviously tell she was horny again, only then did I make a second attempt to remove her top. **Everything I did was well calibrated to the feedback she was giving me.**

**Lesson nine: at some point, the girl will basically decide that she's going to fuck you. Once this happens, you can just go right to the sex.**

I was on the couch, making out with the girl with her top off. She was really into it. I just picked her up, carried her to the bed, set her down, and continued. We were having sex within literally 3 minutes. Something about moving to the bed for this girl meant sex. So I was able to not waste any more time.

If you recognize that a girl has given up resistance, you can literally just strip naked, finger her a little bit, and then bang.

**Tenth lesson: have good sexual skills.**

This doesn't get talked about very much here, as far as I'm aware. But it's so fucking important! You have to do a good job. Really care about her pleasure. Know your way around a vagina. For instance, there are three spots that most women get intense pleasure from. One is the clit. Do you know the other two?

What really helped me out here was David Shade's Sex Manual. Holy. Shit. Is this book good.

Things I learned from it: how to talk to women in bed, different techniques for pleasuring her with hands, mouth, dick, bedroom etiquette, etc. Find this fucking manual. It's been discontinued, you can probably download it from somewhere. Imagine how much confidence you'll have when you know, REALLY KNOW, that you can please women fantastically.

**Lesson eleven, always push for the lay. Even if you want more than just sex with a girl.**

I actually liked my girl. She's cute, fun, spunky, and plays video games. What more can you ask for, right?

Well, on the date itself she was super cute and on best behavior. The sex was fantastic. After sex, though... she kind of got boring. Like, she stopped trying to be so cute. And I actually enjoyed conversation a lot less.

*I would never had known this if we hadn't had sex!!* Sex brings out the real her. Meet the real her ASAP to see if you actually like her. Aaron Sleazy is big on this, and I now recognize why. That was some good wisdom.

Anyway, I'm pretty happy. I was horny as hell from not jerking off (which I highly recommend... I may post about that), and now I'm all tired and content. Go get laid!

This isn't a FR that you'll think 'Oh OP was so awesomely alpha he acted awesome'.

Truth is. I fucked up.

Let us begin.

Thursday the 6th of December. The University Christmas ball. I had a date. Let's all her A. Me and A spend the entire night together, she was my date after all. We both liked each other physically and mentally and at the end of the night we spooned in the hotel room and made out (two other people sleeping in the room so couldn't escalate)

Before the actual ball happened, me and her were in a hot tub and I told her the plan to go watch a piece of theatre at my old college, which was situated in her favourite small town which she loves and always wanted to visit. Came across instantly as a romantic classy kind of guy so this went well.

Fast forward the day after the ball. We went our separate ways and before I left I told her I would text her the plan for Tuesday, kiss on the cheek, winked and left. 

Around 9pm I texted her saying 

'I really enjoyed last night :). Tuesday, meet at _____ around 3ish. We'll catch a train to ______ , grab a bite to eat, _____ park and watch Romeo and Juliet at 6.30....x

No response. The next day I texted 'Stay at mine for the night afterwards you Geordie **(inside joke, r/seduction, use them to your advantage)**, I have a pizza and movie with your name on it.'

one hour later she replied 'Maybe'

This woman is hard I say to myself. Next day I panic about the maybe and text her saying 'I just hope you don't snore like the Kraken again XD I came back from the toilet and Caroline was like 'RISEABOVEIT. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE HER STOP'

No response. Fast forward to the day we are supposed to meet.

3.09 

ME : taking your sweet time to get here

her : Where are you now? 

me : (station name ) Platform 2

her : Get a train to (the city that she lives in)!

me : (City name!)!? What about the play?

Her : I have no money at all, i'm so poor, come here!'

INSTINCT. For many people, their first instinct is the right one. For me, it's my **second**. My first said 'Go to her, it's ok!' and my 2nd said 'No, continue on your own to the play, you have friends there, your old teacher is waiting for you. Go!'

I chose the first instinct. Damn.

I got the train there, she made me wait 15 minutes at the station, told me she was going home to get ready from a friends house. She told me to walk to a leisure centre in the meanwhile. Fast forward me walking for 1 hour in the freezing cold. She texts me saying she is **bringing a friend**

**For the entire night?** I ask, no reply. Eventually she rings me and says meet outside. 

I see this chump. I introduce myself, shake his hand, she's got no makeup on, ill as anything and she's just come from his house. 

I ask what's the plan then? Your house?

She thinks and agrees and we start walking. Her in the middle.

This chump is taking all her attention. Inside jokes, talking about work, something I couldn't relate to. I ask her what's she is doing for new years, she simply says 'Not spending it in (city name) *aka the city i'm from, because she knows i'm gathering a big crew up to sleep at my house after a massive night out*

I brush it off and we keep walking. I'm slightly annoyed but I try to hide it. How can she bring another guy ffs.

We are all in her bedroom. He is lying on her bed, she is sitting on the bed with her ipad and i'm on her desk chair wondering WTF is going on.

My first instinct kicks in again. 'Text her to get rid of him' or 'Endure it'



I slyly text her saying 'Get rid of him! I came here to spend time with you not him!'

She see the text and replies 'Can't, sorry.'

First instinct kicks in again. LEAVE or ENDURE.


**Endure, wait it out, DON'T MAKE RASH DECISIONS**

So I said, 'Yaknow, I think I can catch the train back in time for the play. I'm off'

her : You're leaving Riseabove it? (She almost sounded sad)

Me : Yeah I can still catch the train, Nice meeting you (i said to the other guy)

Her : wait, come here (she holds out her arms, i go to give a lame hug, she bends her head to kiss her on the cheek, i don't'

I leave and start walking back in the freezing cold. She texts me saying 'Is everything okay?'

*I panic, wtf do I do, fuck it AHHHH** my mind screams.

I reply 

me : It was nice while it lasted, but i'm not going to be messed about anymore.

(you may be wondering about why I send something so dramatic, truth be told was that it was a lot of effort to get to be my date for the ball and stuff, she messed me around a lot.)

her : What does that mean?

Me : It means I don't come all the way to (city name) to see you for you **yeah i made a booboo, just shows how much I was panicing** because I like you a lot just to be a third wheel really

her : I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd be like that :( I thought you'd enjoy meeting my friends'

I panic even more **ohh no SHE WAS JUST BEING NICE, OH CRAP WHY DID I LEAVE**

me : I'm coming back

me : I do. Let me make it up, i'm not giving up on you.

**bet you're all cringing at this point. I would. What a fucking moron I am.**

I start walking back and she rings me saying look we'll meet up another time, i go no i'm here now let me apologise, NO please it's just awkward now my friend feels really bad and awkward, NO i'm here just lets discuss this

I make my way back into her house and she takes me outside, it was bad r/seduction, so bad, I tell her about why I was annoyed, I planned a trip and she just brought a guy, I felt like **shit** i say to her. I say 'So what, are we even dating? It doesn't feel like it' she replies I don't know. She doesn't let me kiss her i grab her hand and she pulls away and I make her pinky promise to meet up another time, she pinky promises and we go our separate ways. I can't recall too much of what I said because it was an adrenaline filled blur of panic and me looking like a complete **BITCH.** Just imagine fucking up 100%. I ran back to her house I was out of breathe. I WAS SO BETA. fuck the word beta, i was pathetic. NOT AWESOME as I usually am.

She texts later at night asking for an explanation and how she just wanted me to meet her best friend in the world. I give her a monologue about how **lets be honest, you don't bring another guy on a fucking date.** in a nice but affirmative tone. It simply wasn't on. I paid the price for her mistake. She brought another guy and I FUCKED UP. All the teachings I've learned from this subreddit went FLYING out the window.

She apologises and says we can meet up just the two of us. I ask about next week, she says she's working basically and doesn't pick up when I ring her.

I wait 3 days, during one day I accidentally  ring her and apologise for ringing her via text **betaaaaaaa* I tell her about a double date happening this weekend. She asked who's the other guy and what city. I tell her. 

She doesn't reply so I responded today saying 'You forgot to reply saying 'Oh RiseAboveIt, I would love to double date this weekend! You're so kind to me' or shall I take your lack of response as a no?'

Tbh I should have texted her famous the 'Hey didn't hear back from you so I'm taking someone else. Maybe another time'

I may have missed some details out. I don't know it seems ages ago now. Either way I'm pretty sure she's not going to respond to me. I need to move on don't I? How goddamn dare she bring another guy to a date. FFS. Whatever. I need to find a fucking date for this weekend.

GOD it makes me so pissed. I'm not totally in the wrong. **SHE BROUGHT ANOTHER GUY TO A DATE** and then **I REACTED POORLY*

We both fucked up really.

I went to a grocery store, bought a bunch of healthy food (no skimping!) and a jug of tea, and went back to give it to the guy, whose name is Stan.  I stayed and listened to Stan tell me his story for about an hour, maybe longer, I didn't really look.  Right there, on the corner, while he had the sign around his neck asking for change.  

I don't think it has much to do with seduction, per se.  Or maybe it does.  I don't think it was a selfless act, I wanted something out of it.  I wanted to stop being too afraid to step out of my comfort zone, my life of privilege and comfort, to hear one of the 7 billion people on this planet's story.  It took me some courage (just speaking personally).  Usually, I can't meet the man on the corner's eye.  I plan to do this more often, randomly, as the opportunity arises.  It felt incredible to do something for someone that I didn't have any connection to.  It felt incredible to give (albeit meagerly) of my money to make sure that guy has a full stomach for the next few days.  It felt good to know that I let him know that I DO care.  

I hope all of you would do some random acts of kindness.  Besides how incredible it makes you feel, remember that all it takes is a set of unfortunate circumstances, and WE are the man standing on the corner with the sign while the world passes us by and wont meet our gaze.

DON'T ASK IF YOU CAN KISS HER!!!! I hate this; every girl I know hates this; I have never met a girl who says she likes/appreciates being asked. Many girls will say no even if they had previously wanted the guy to kiss her! It makes her feel like he isn't confident. 



There are two scenarious:

1) You ask to kiss her. She will either reject or accept it.

2) You try to kiss her without asking. She will either reject or accept it.

Either way, you have the same outcome. The only difference is whether you emasculated yourself by asking. 

A girl wants a confident man who can brush off rejection with a laugh. Don't look embarrassed or upset. Joke about it, say, ""I see how it is,"" and take a couple steps back, but smile and change the subject. Don't ask about seeing her again. Talk about something funny and make her laugh. Don't move toward her again; let her come to you. 

DON'T hesitate when you're about to kiss her - just go for it! Hesitating to think about it gives her time to hesitate and think about it, too.



Getting Sex:

If a girl says she doesn't want to have sex/wants to slow down/etc., don't pressure her. 

If she wants to slow down but not stop, say, ""That's fine. I could kiss you all night.""

Proceed to kiss her, but take your hands off of her body and don't let them wander. Lean away from her, let her come to you and touch you. Once she's pressing herself against you and feeling you up (lol), hold her close. Let her set the pace. You will get farther with her and make her feel comfortable with you.

If she says she doesn't want to have sex, say, ""Obviously I want to have sex, but we'll do whatever you want."" Then move completely off of her and lay on your back. If she makes a smart ass comment or joke about how of course you want to have sex because you're a guy, don't respond. Let it linger. Don't make a single move toward her.

She will eventually say something like, ""Seriously, are you not even going to kiss me?"" Don't say a word, but kiss her and let her pull you on top of her. Kiss her passionately but don't try anything else. Let her get riled up and ask for more.

No matter what, if the girl doesn't want to have sex, you can't have sex, so you have nothing to lose by trying this technique. Backing off makes you seem like you respect her, are a nice guy, are trustworthy, and that it's her decision. 

Gettin' in Dem Panties:

Don't just dive into her panties with your fingers or try to take them off without turning her on first. Kiss her and put your thigh between her thighs and let her rub against you. Use your hand to rub her through her panties until she gets wet. Then push the crotch of them aside and rub her softly. After that, take her panties off. She should be ready. If she's not, back off and go back to kissing her, and grind your erection into the crotch of her panties. Dry-humping is underestimated! Do it until she wraps her legs around your waist and starts moving with you, then try to take off her panties again. If it's going to happen, it'll happen then. If it's not going to happen, lean back and start jacking yourself off slowly while kissing her. The moment she reaches to help you, take your hand away and let her. At least you might get a handjay or some head.

Good luck!

For whatever reason, I decided to take the train home (the South). 9:30pm departure from South Station. Red eye.

Everyone is asleep/being quiet. I'm thinking this is gonna be boring as shit. WRONG. I ride for several stops. A girl gets on at New Haven and parks directly across the isle from me. She's sitting next to another college dude, but he's completely plugged in. I'm like, ""Damn, i've got nothing to lose. How do I make a move though?""

Then it hit me: Hangman. Not a conventional strategy, but I was pleased with myself. I grab my moleskine, draw a hangman setup (category: movies), and pass it to her without saying a word. Eye contact though. She's immediately down. We play, meanwhile writing biographical notes in the margin. I offer to buy her a drink. She says she will...after I complete HER hangman! Playful.

I finish the hangman and we move to the bar. Conversation is tense at first. We're two strangers on a fucking red eye train. Things loosen up with the alc and when we get back to our seats I invite her to sit with me. She does. Conversation continues. We talk about what we do and make funny observations about people on the train. Convo gets softer and moodier. I notice she's making more eye contact with me than before. I'm like, ""Aha! IOI!"" No pun intended. So I test it out and hold her gaze longer than usual. She holds. I go in for the kiss. We make out and she sleeps on me (It's a train seat, ok?) for the next 5 hrs.

",300,54,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mkav1/just_give_value_man/,"I know this has been said a million different ways (hell, I've read probably most variations already); but it just recently ""clicked"" for me and I wanted to share in case someone else might find it helpful. I don't mean to re-invent anything, think of this post as a reminder. 

For some years now, I've been one of the most pragmatic, nihilist sons of bitches I know. I've been self-centered, my interests always ahead of everyone's, if not the only important thing. This didn't bring me happiness, nor did it bring me abundance as I've always wanted. Sure, I've gotten lots of girls all these years, way more than I would have had I not studied seduction. But they didn't ever ""fill that gap"": I was never truly happy, and I could tell they weren't either. Furthermore, they weren't exactly the quality women I knew I was looking for. Me being an asshole, most of these girls always had some sort of problem where they were a perfect match for my don't-give-a-fuck attitude. But this rarely ended well, and for a long time I haven't had a meaningful, long, serious relationship. 

I started hitting the gym, learned about psychoanalysis, read everything seduction related on the internet, and in the end, same results. 

However, I recently noticed that getting women was probably the sole purpose of my life. Almost everything I did was, in some way, related to getting more women in the end. This mentality made me either not give as much value as I could've given, or even worse, take value instead. Since I noticed this, I've been working on shifting my way of looking at life to a new purpose: improve in every way possible, so as to give value to everyone. And for the first time in many years, I feel like I'm on my way to true happiness, a heavy weight lifted off my shoulders. 

Now that my purpose is to leave everyone at a better place than where I found them, everything is different. The veil has been lifted from my eyes. All the reasons why I improve myself (physically, mentally, socially) are now oriented to having a life where I have so much value to give, everyone is, if only for a moment, happier for having met me. 

So what I guess it comes down to is: shift your focus. Elevate everyone. If you've been hitting the gym to get ripped and get more girls, fine... but also incorporate helping/motivating someone who might be stuck at the point where you started, for example. Help everyone whenever possible, no matter who. You don't need to step too much out of your way (or be a doormat who is at the very whim of the people you try to help), but do help when you can. 

If they don't appreciate it, fine. Continue on your merry way. If they appreciate it, that's a bonus. If they reciprocate by giving value to your life, keep them in there. Those are few and far between. 

When you start truly practicing this, you will find you no longer care if you get the girl, or how many, etc. Your mind won't be wondering about IOI's, negs, and all that stuff. You already know this, but since your focus is to give value, they will be drawn to you (of course you can then charm them by being the suave motherfucker seddit has taught you to be). 

In the end, (and sorry for the long ass post) I can sum it up like this: keep improving your life, so that you can give value to everyone else's. ",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_mkav1,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mkav1/just_give_value_man/,

Part 2: Non-Verbal, basics.",306,65,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fzo47/communicating_like_a_boss_part_2_nonverbal_basics/,"For those who want to read [Part 1: Speaking with Clarity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fpfp6/communicating_like_a_boss_part_1_speaking_with/)

I had originally planned to further elaborate on speech, rhetoric construction, and the different ways to consider when communicating, and writing, but a small comment discussion in part 1 lead me to want to talk about physical presence and body language instead. 

When it comes to speaking, whether as a speech or in a conversation, there are a certain number of things you can do in order to tip the odds in your favour. Many of you know these, but it’s here as a reminder and in a different context. 

&gt; **Posture**

Stand up straight. Duh? When you force yourself to stand up straight, you typically get a wave of energy and confidence, which will help with your delivery. When it comes to picking up girls, or delivering a presentation of some sort, I’m sure you can imagine why this is helpful. When you give a speech, a good posture is a very subliminal “I know what I’m talking about.” As it portrays confidence, and security. 

When you sit, sit up straight. It shows you are healthy, that you are not lazy, and you are also paying attention. Leaning in has its purposes, but this should not be your default, nor should slouching, or sinking into your chair.  


&gt; **Shaking hands**

You’d think this one is a no brainer right? Before you shake their hand, match their height, then extend your hand out so that your forearm is parallel to the ground, don’t reach out too far, and don’t keep your elbow in too close. When you do go to shake their hand, look them in the eye – you’re greeting them, not their hand. It’s also important to have a firm grip, as to other men it shows that you are a fuckin’ man, and to women, it shows them that you’re a fuckin’ man. Do not misinterpret this as a squeezing match. 


&gt; **I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS?!**

Kino. If you’re making a speech however, your hands should be visible at all times. This means that they are out of any potential pockets and that they are not hiding behind things. When you speak, using your hands as a form of emphasis, as a form of pacing, and expression is welcomed. Speaking with two hands is actually more convincing (I will find the source later). This is for all walks of life, selling things, describing things, suggesting things. 


&gt; **Tone**

This is a form of non-verbal communication that doesn’t actually use your physical body to display. This is often a sticking point for people who start out, because they approach with an opener that worked a thousand times for others, and then they get shot down before they finish their sentence. This is likely because they are fighting the approach anxiety and can’t let out more than a creepy mumble, or they compensate by shooting bolts of refined energy in form of words. For those who think they are monotone, or they have issue in portraying the correct tone, there are a few ways you can improve this;

**Record yourself** – Say a word or repeat a line or use an opener on yourself. Do this in multiple times, in different ways so that you understand your own range. For some, we might think that our default tone is friendly, neutral, and completely harmless, but in relative terms, it might come off as intense, or aggressive. With practice, you will have more control. 

**Change your tone, then deliver** – Want to be friendlier? Smile, think happy thoughts, then deliver what you were going to say. When you are happy, you sound happier. When you are serious, you sound serious. This is method acting 101, but without delving into the depths, you can take the simple method with you and use it to your advantage.

Loved the post. Now how about some ""actionable intelligence"": how about a list of things I should get used to doing/saying that would convey that other women want me?!

And by the way I'm assuming that it's not good to just go around bragging about how many beautiful women (real or immaginary) adore and hang out with me.

So from the post it was clear what not to do. Don't

* put her on a pedestal
* whine about other women
* be needy, clingy and passive-aggressive

The generally good things to do are:

* be confident
* be confident
* be confident

Now, here's what I thought might be some of the specific little subtle things we can do when we are interacting with a target girl to show that other women want us:

* be conservative with how you spend your time: don't adapt your  schedule to hers all the time and don't spend hours chatting with her on the phone or messaging. (it helps if you have several friend circles I guess)
* talk about recent good times you had with friends/girls. Or in general talk about your other female friends
* make it a point to text or call other females (not to the point of being rude, just to make it clear that you have other things going on)
post a lot on facebook (photos and comments) with other girls
* talk and interact with ALL females in your environment
* be seen by your target girl in the company of other girls

IMO all the growth in technology has had a negative effect on game. Simply, girls today have more options and more distractions literally at their fingertips than ever before. They get their egos stroked constantly on Facebook. They have guys constantly blowing up their smartphones texting them out. They get hounded with hundreds of messages on online dating sites. They’re getting constant attention and validation and being pulled in all directions. 

There was a time when “getting a number” actually meant something. You’d call her home and she’d pick up, you’d have an actual phone conversation, you’d set up a date and she’d actually show up. It sounds like something from the Jurassic period but the older guys here will attest to this.   

Now it’s 2011. How many threads have we read here where a guy seemingly has a great interaction with a girl in a club and gets the number, only to have the girl screen out his call or ignore his texts a few days later? “Flaking” as a verb didn’t exist in the 90s or earlier – flakes were something that came with dandruff.   

It’s funny to read guys in here still crowing about getting numbers. Fellas, numbers means nothing. How many of those numbers are translating to dates and lays?   

Girls today give out their number like candy on Halloween. Girls will give out their number to get rid of you. Girls will give out their number just to get their egos validated from constant texts. Girls will give out their number even when they have no intention of seeing you again. 

Now guys will come on here and say that it’s all a numbers game – that you need to talk to 100 girls and get 20 numbers, play these little text games, and maybe get 3 dates out of it. 

Who has time for that sh*t? I have other demands on my time – I work, I study, I work out, volunteer, have hobbies, and spend time with family and friends. Far better to invest in one quality interaction with one quality girl that I’ll be assured of eventually dating and laying.

Before you get all upset, hear me out.

The alpha-male part is expected, and even -ok- I suppose, since after all it's a subreddit geared mainly towards males trying to pick up females.  What is incredible to me, is the AWFUL advice I consistantly see from commenters who clearly lack experience.  Admitted virgins giving sex tips because of things they read from other 'PUAs,' guys who have never been in relationships giving relationship advice, experienced PUAs giving advanced techniques to guys who clearly can't utilize it.  Someone needs to be moderating this shit better.  Maybe you should have to be fucking verified before you start giving awful ass advice to people.  I don't know, maybe I have a utopian view of this early-human subreddit.

My main gripe is ""text game,"" and the horrid advice I've read on this subreddit.  The majority of the advice involves a variant of ""text only to say hi, schedule date, and confirm date.""  Girls are not fucking robots.  They're fucking human beings like us (SHOCKER).  For the most part, they enjoy staying in contact throughout the day.  Text them memes, be random, but more importantly just be yourself.  If they don't respond very quickly or at all, pump the brakes and see if they initiate contact after you leave them alone for a while.  If they don't text you again unsolicited, guess what?  They're not interested!  Plenty of other fish in the sea etc etc.

I do. 

She texts me 5 mins. later: ""Where are you?""

I tell her to find my other friends and have them give her a ride.

Fast forward to the next bar. Opening two HB8 sisters. I make sure she sees this.

Next time I see her, I say: ""You know, I've always wondered what you were like in bed.""

I could see her tilt like a pinball machine.

She: ""I'm speechless. No one has EVER said that to me before.""

Me: ""Well, what do we do about it?""

She: ""I don't know...""

Me: ""Something to think about.""

Later on, she comes up to my condo. I feed her frozen pizza and she says she will drive home that night. I tell her I want her to stay. She says she knows, but needs to get up early to meet her sister.

He put hungry cats in a cage with food that they could see and smell just out of reach. The cages could be opened by pressing a lever. 

The cats scratched at the cage. They pawed at the ceiling. They tried to squeeze through the bars. They whined loudly. Their little cat brains went crazy. They kept fucking around in the cage until they accidentally pressed the lever. 

Their little cat brains rejoiced, and they ate.

Thorndike waited 'til they were hungry again and put them back in the cage. Again, their little cat brains could not fathom the situation, but eventually they pressed the lever. Again, they ate, and again Thorndike returned them to the cage.

After enough repetition, their little cat brains began to catch on. They began to press the lever as soon as they were put in the cage. Thorndike smirked and scribbled in his notebook. Silly cats, huh?

Not as silly as you might think. The thing is, this type of learning, called ""operant conditioning,"" is common to pretty much everything with a brain. Including you. 

Thorndike concluded that the cats learned the puzzle cage's solution through trial and error. Generally, behaviors that lead to a satisfying state of affairs are repeated, while behaviors that maintain an unsatisfying state of affairs are not. 

*This process, this operant conditioning, is the only way to learn a skill, and pickup, like golf or art or skydiving, is a skill. You can learn the theory from the internet and from* The Game *and* The Mystery Method *but you you cannot learn the skill unless you apply it.*

And the application is going to mean trial and error. 

Granted, you are not a cat. You are a human being, with vastly more effective intellectual capacity. However, you are not in a cage with a single lever. You are trapped in a vastly more complex, labyrinthine puzzle. And until you fuck around and find something that works, a behavior that leads to a ""satisfying state of affairs,"" your little human brain won't be able to fathom the situation.

TL;DR

These are 5 things that I'm always pushing in the field. Assuming you have value to bring to the table, doing these 5 things persistently will get you into lots of doors (and beds, and pants).

1. **Be interesting** - Having cool things to say about yourself.
2. **Be good at some kind of thing that you can visually show off** - Can you juggle? Make paper animals? Really good at darts? Dancing? Basically peacock with a talent, versus just looking different.
3. **Be fun** - This might sound vague, but it's essentially bringing an element of adventure and unpredictability to your social interactions
4. **Be bold** - This is all about outcome independence. You have to realize that some women will just reject you. Do not let fear of negative outcomes keep you from doing what you want to do.
5. **Be sexual** - Also vague sounding, but very important. Be open to sex as if it's a completely normal interaction (it's probably the most normal interaction in human history, without which there IS no human history).

It works for me, and I think it can work for you.

I feel [simplepickup](http://www.youtube.com/simplepickup#p/u/11/pcNE3yx_3D8) very clearly demonstrates that it really doesn't matter what you say when you approach a girl. I've even found that girls will tend to relax and open up more when I fumble my words. I don't know the exact science but it seems to work.

The number one most important is how confident you are. You can try to ""fake it till you make it"" but I think its much easier (and logical) to just acquire some real confidence in approaching strangers.

With real confidence, one stops caring about ""failure"". I'd even go as far as to say that the concept of ""failure"" seems to disappear altogether as one acquires real confidence.

Real confidence is when one has complete faith in themselves. One with real confidence doesn't doubt himself. If something doesn't got the way he wants, he never blames himself. He knows that he did his best given the circumstances, pats himself on the back for a job well done, and learns as much as he can from the experience.

It seems a lot of beginners are asking the wrong question : *how do you do it?*

I feel the more appropriate question is : *how did you learn to do it?*

I don't know how the other guys here learned to approach girls and (hopefully) get their numbers but I can tell you how I learned and this is my *number one tip for beginners*.

**Talk to everybody**

There's no doubt about it in my mind. I improved my social skills because I forced myself to be social. I didn't literally talk to everybody but I started seeking out conversations with strangers more and more. Sometimes they went great and I made a new friend, sometimes I didn't get along with the person at all and just went on my way as soon as socially acceptable. 

Regardless of the outcome, I **always** learned something from the experience so I never regretted. In fact, I'm incredibly grateful for this community for pushing me to talk to strangers. It's enriched my life in so many ways.

As I got better and better at starting and **keeping** good conversations with strangers of all sorts, a lot of the [inner game](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/kcedb/a_common_blindspot_to_success/) stuff that's discussed in the community started to come naturally. 

I gained confidence in my ability to brighten a stranger's day and the more confident I became the more easily I could brighten a stranger's day. This is because [people respond positively to confidence](http://www.amazon.com/What-Every-BODY-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294) (&lt;- dry as hell but a must read). 

Eventually, I felt I reached a point of confidence saturation even ""bad"" interactions with strangers stopped hurting my confidence. I had so much faith in myself and my abilities to talk to strangers (and hopefully brighten both of our days) that when interactions went ""badly"", I knew it was because of no fault of mine. The only thing I felt bad about was that the stranger has missed an opportunity for a pleasant conversation.

The great news is that being comfortable approaching and talking to strangers makes it that much easier to approach and talk to cute girls. Sometimes it'll go great and you'll meet an awesome chick, sometimes you'll discover that friendly-looking girl is actually an ice cold bitch with serious psychological issues. Either way, I promise you won't regret it.

Even the ""worst"" interactions (protective boyfriend/father shows up, you scare the bajeezus out of her with your high energy approach, your friend just hit on the same girl with the same line, she notices your friend is filming the interaction) are blessings in disguise because they make for great laughs and an effective reminder that [it's just a ride](http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/18385/Bill_Hicks___It_s_just_a_ride/).

tl;dr : We are social animals, go act like one.

It's like when you say, ""I'm not good with names."" and you remember her name - she loves that. Be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

So you got her number, and the next day she wants to text you to get to know you. The quickest, easiest way out of this is to send a pretty direct text back along the lines of, ""Let's grab coffee/lunch and we can actually talk in person :)""

**1) The “grind” is really fucking important.**

Do your 1000 approaches. Improve yourself. Get experience in the field, no matter how small and insignificant it might seem compared to the crazy sets you've heard people talk about. You gotta start small to get good.

**2) There’s a difference between knowing how to do something, and actually being able to do it well.**

What you learn in a place like Seddit is theory. It's easy to be good at theory if you're halfway intelligent and read a lot.

To be successful in anything, requires an equally competent ability to execute. You learn how to execute well by grinding.

**3) Strategic thinking is key. Sometimes knowing the environment/situation is just as important as knowing the end level boss.**

Sometimes you'll be blown out in ways that you think is unfair - whether you get amogged, locked out by uninterested friends, or you just happened to approach at the wrong time, you have to be good at reading situations while you're in the middle of them.

**4) Your player character isn’t inherently good at everything. You have to deal with that.**

I'm good with groups. I'm good at approaching groups of people, being accepted by them, and raising their energy. 

That actually means I comparatively suck at isolating girls, because nothing lowers the energy of a group like taking the energetic people away from it.

I didn't choose these skills, and to be better at one is to sacrifice the other, so I choose to deal with it by going with what I'm naturally good at, and mitigating my weaknesses in other ways.

**5) Sometimes, it’s best to put down the controller and do something else for a little while.**

If you ever find yourself angry with yourself, or with women, as I have found myself before, **you need to get away from the game for a while.**

I can't stress this enough. There's a ton of failure attributable to guys spending too much time on game, and it's because they're setting themselves up for failure.

If you're so frustrated you can't play the game without getting angry, you need to back off for a while.

I'm a 20 year old PUA and am successful in at least number closes about 95% of the time. I have been studying the art of picking up women for a few years, and now I feel it's time to give back to the community which has had such a positive impact on my game.

Disclaimer: I am a good looking guy; I've had some modeling experience and I find this makes things a lot easier. However, it does not diminish my game or my enjoyment of the study, in fact it has put me in a lot of awkward situations, and forced me to be social and 'flirty' from a young age. At this point I only hit on HB 9's and 10's, and am extremely successful.

Much of Seddit consists of field reports, which are great, but through my years of study I find it best to watch PUA videos available on youtube. Daygame videos are often the most valuable because it consists of the purest game (no alcohol involved). After reading countless reports, tips and so called ""secrets"", I've managed to break down everything I've read into 7 key topics, all of which are broad, but I think my insight will help a lot of you grasp exactly what we're talking about. 

Before you continue adopt the mindset of making YOU your special project, improving yourself and the quality of your life. Do not worry about women or what anyone else thinks.

7. START WORKING OUT
   Jesus. This is not that hard. Did you know that once you do something 12 days in a row it is established as habit? the first 12 days of any workout regimen is the hardest, are you really that big of a pussy that you can't dedicate 50 minutes a day for 12 days to work out? its less than 4% of your day, and the endorphins are addicting. Start working out in the mornings if you can: first thing. It's hard the first few times but after that you lear to love it, you walk around the rest of the day confident with great endorphins, and feel good. I can not overstate the impact that 50 minutes of exercise per day will have on your game.

6. POSITIVE ENERGY
    This is crucial, the first few seconds you meet someone you sense their energy, and within 3 seconds women will make up 90% of their mind about you. If you come in strong, make good eye contact and smile, no one will think you are creepy. If you come in second guessing yourself, avoiding eye contact, and are so focus on what you say that you can't smile, you may come off as not ""alpha"".

5. BE YOURSELF
    I have always hated this piece of advice. What does that even mean? Be yourself? it's shitty advice without a definition to back it up, a definition which has taken me years of success and failure to figure out.
Realize first that you are not weird, you've had years of experience which have brought you to this mindset, this point, no one can say these experiences have not happened to you. Nothing you say in the moment will be weird if it comes naturally, SAY THE FIRST THING THAT POPS INTO YOUR HEAD- it'll allow you to relax and really understand what being yourself is all about. it doesn't matter what you say, as long as you keep up your positive attitude.

4. ""LOVE OF MY LIFE""
    this is the only line I think works consistently; if you are having a conversation with a women and she mentions ANYTHING in common with you, even something as stupid as shoelace color, say ""love of my life"" in a flirty and joking manner, smile and laugh. this is a fantastic line because it can be interpreted two ways: if she likes you, she'll take it as a funny and flirty compliment, allowing you to smoothly transition to an admission of attraction. If this girl is not attracted to you, she will only take it as a joke. Feel free to use this line liberally.

3. WOMEN ARE MORE SELF CONSCIOUS THAN MEN
    Seems hard to believe sometimes right? Especially when approach anxiety is so strong that you can barely even stand up straight. But it's true. Women are raised in an environment where pretty much one thing matters: looks. I guarantee you that no girl you see out in the street, in class, in the mall, is confident in the way she looks. These women have been accustomed to seeing the same things on magazine covers and on tv: exaggerated figures of beauty (think an airbrushed kate uptown on the cover of SI Swimsuit.) How many of those actual stunning women do you see outside of the media? 0. These so called normal women (not celebrities) look at this picture of a touched up kate upton and wish and wish that they looked like that, when in reality, even kate uptown does't look like that. Women think that THIS is the way they need to look to be considered truly beautiful. Thats why complimenting women works so well: all they want is to feel beautiful, and very very few feel that way naturally. You may be walking around all day feeling like people are looking at you, judging you on your looks, but in actuality that conception is much stronger for the female gender. WOMEN are actually so nervous about people looking at them throughout the day that all they think of is themselves, they're not judging you on your looks. 

2. KEEP GOING
    Practice makes perfect; the more girls you talk to the more fluid your conversations become. Just like working out it's the first 12 that are the hardest. If you can talk to 12 girls, success or failure, congratulations, you've upgraded to yellow belt. thats all it takes. Learn to love rejection and failure: seems impossible, but if you successfully adopt the mindset that you are outcome independent, you can actually learn to start liking getting rejected. There is a video from long ago where Chris Farley hit on girls for an SNL skit; he got rejected time and time again and all he did was laugh and move on. Perfect. Do that, even if it hurts. Again, like the gym, each time you feel the pain of getting rejected, think of it akin to the pain of  working out, sure it hurts but each push up, each step, gets you a little bit closer. 

1. ITS NOT WHAT YOU SAY ITS HOW YOU SAY IT.
    Approach anxiety is the beginning PUA's worst enemy. AA manifests because of our own insecurities, but what we are neglecting to realize is that everyone has those anxieties.  What you have to realize is that you can say almost ANYTHING (barring the obvious), and if you say it with confidence, NO ONE WILL THINK THAT IT IS WEIRD. Say ridiculous stuff with a smile, and you'll see that women respond well to it. I have an example with my friends. I have two close friends, we'll call them A and B. A is confident, he always smiles when he speaks, and he is good at engaging women in conversation. B speaks slowly, like an old man almost, and squints when he talks, rarely smiles. Both A and B can go up to the same girl, and say the same thing, and get totally different responses. That girl you're nervous about talking to? She'll be a lot more nervous than you once you actually grow some balls and start talking. see tip number 2.

I hope I was able to help some people out, I'd love to answer any questions.

EDIT: Wow thanks for the awesome response! making my first post fun and keeping me posting. I think a big part of the issue that people are bringing up is that no, i don't have any sure fire tricks to make a girl sleep with you. a lot of people on seddit are looking for ""quick-fixes"" and easy answers.

Not just with women, but with everyone. The reason is because I've developed a bad habit that causes me to avoid eye contact. I work in Asia and people just don't seem to like it, so I just avert my gaze whenever the situation occurs.

I've set a few rules for myself using things I've read on seddit: 1. Never break eye contact first, 2. Depending on the context, couple eye contact with other facial expressions Ex: Couple the eye contact with a small smile when you catch a HB glancing at you. Raise your eye brows during a rapport-building conversation. Others. 

Last night it fucking worked. I was out at a bar doing everything I normally do, but this time really focusing on eye contact. All of the sets I opened ended favorably. A few were intense. Eye contact can trigger almost animal like reactions.

1364819966.0,236,self.seduction,1bf2l0,Average guy. My short life-story with my weekend recap.,355,119,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1bf2l0/average_guy_my_short_lifestory_with_my_weekend/,"I stumbled upon seddit and this is about to open a new world for me. I never knew there were communities like this. Let me tell you a little about myself.   

Background: I'm an average guy. I never really picked up anything better than a HB6. 
I was broken my senior year in high school when I told the girl I was dating I ""loved"" her, and she responded with, ""I'm seeing other people."" In fact we had a pregnancy scare and she wasn't sure if I was the father or one of the other two guys she was fucking. Once all cleared up I left her and fell into a depression. It was sad and I was pathetic. I was a fucking mess and would slap myself if I could go back in time. 
My freshman year I met another girl. We became friends quick and I told her how I truly felt about her and she rejected me. Again my soft self was a bitch and a fucking loser. 
So I decided to change myself. To just have flings, to have fun, and never get emotionally attached. I am young, why not live in the moment for a while, I have time before I consider getting serious. 
I began physically working on the way I looked by dressing nicer, fixing up my hair, washing my face to fight acne. It was working, women began noticing me more and more. It felt great, but this wasn't enough. Soon I began hitting the gym. It was slow progress, but was totally worth it. I became more confident in myself. 
I've been improving myself for 2 years now. All on my own, I'd improved myself with little to no outside help besides my friends to go for tips occasionally. So this brings me to today, I'm 6' and I weigh 210lbs, 6% body fat, I'm an average guy that worked hard and woman now would consider me an 8 instead of the 5 I once was. 

At first It sucked getting rejected and I hated it. I'd get down when I was rejected and ask myself, ""why am I changing myself? Why am I wasting my time to better myself if I can't succeed at the one thing I set out to do?"" So one night I went out with the sole purpose of getting rejected. I wanted to conquer the feeling of getting rejected. And let me tell you I got rejected. When a girl was giving IOIs I'd walk away. I'd look for girls out of my league and would push my limits as to what was appropriate. But it worked. I didn't go home with anyone. I walked home and learned. Rejection isn't bad, I use it now to fuel my desire to become better. Now when I'm rejected on a set, I analyze what I did and focus in on what I could have done better.

For those looking for the perfect openers or easy pick ups you need to come to a realization that there is no such thing. If you're an average chump like me, you'll always have to work for what you get. Openers should be natural, start a conversation about anything. It doesn't matter. I opened a girl at the supermarket just by sarcastically saying, ""you're not just getting that? Are you?"" (They were all fruits and vegetables in her basket). An opener can be anything, just talk to them. Another time I commented on a woman's ""pumps"" she was surprised I knew what they were called. I said I had a sister (I really don't though). We hit it off. But I digress this isn't what I wanted to focus on. 

My recent story: 
My buddy calls me up and asks if I want to go to the bar, I give in and join him. So while we are at the bar we talk about school and future plans. I really wasn't looking for a hookup that night. He gets a text from one of his friends saying she is having a house party, she happens to be turning 21. So we ditch the bar and join this 21st birthday. 
 When we arrive on scene there is a ratio of girls to guys in our favor. 3 girls for every one guy it seemed. Mostly because there were some homosexuals that kept to themselves in the corner but would converse with the birthday girl from time to time. So first thing we do when we get there is take shots with the bday girl who is a HB8. Me and her hit it off pretty well (I happen to work with children so when I say what I do for a living women usually let their guard down). She happened to be studying child development so she was an easy catch. The night progresses and I go and meet all these other women nothing really eventful happened so I'll skip ahead. 
I'm getting pretty drunk at this point and people are starting to go home.  My buddy is talking to a few people he knows so I ditched them to find the HB8 birthday girl. When I found her I pull her towards me and start making out with her, after a few moments we stop and stare at each other, she smiles and grabs my hand then pulls me to her room. Things are hot and we're making out as I close the door behind me, and I ask which bed is hers. I throw her on her roommates bed and say, ""things are going to get dirty lets not ruin your bed"" this builds her sexual desire and we make out a little more—I had no intentions of hooking up with anyone so I came unprepared and didn't have condoms. I casually ask, ""do you have any condoms"" 
""No, but it's okay I'm on Birth Control."" 
At this point I'm thinking that this isn't the best idea. So I need an exit. I was still fully dressed and she was in her underwear — her dress was easily removed during the interrogation. She takes off my shirt and notices that I'm fit and stops for a moment. She makes the comment that ""this can't be real and you're too good to be true."" Fuck yeah, this hard work pays off. So we make out more and I begin to move things to the next level. She is ready to jump my bones and kept saying that it was ""too good to be true."" So my drunk self thinks, Fuck this, I don't have a condom, she says she is on BirthControl, ""I'm too good to be true."" Obviously there is something wrong with this girl if she kept saying that this is ""too good to be true."" 
So at this point, she was on my lap facing me, I pick her up and set her down on her bed. I say, ""this IS too good to be true. You're too drunk. Snap out of it."" I say all this while I'm putting my shirt on and walking out the door. She just stared at me as I walked out and close the door behind me. Found my friend who happened to be looking for me cause he was ready to go and we both dipped. 

You guys probably think I'm a fucking idiot I should have f-closed. I want to know form you guys what you would have done?  Fuck her? Or walk out?  You tell me.  
I've f-closed women in my past, this one just didn't feel right. 

I'm not a PUA. I'm not a ladies man. I'm an average guy who has worked hard at improving himself. Now that I found this community I know I can grow significantly. Many of you have stories and mine might relate to some of yours. If not then sorry for the long read. 

**TL;DR** I had an opportunity to f-close, but chose to walk out. 

**Edit**: I'm not 6% body fat, i was giving myself too much credit for my hard work. I was simply saying I put in my time to look great, and girls love it. :P",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1364850779.0,,,True,t3_1bf2l0,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1bf2l0/average_guy_my_short_lifestory_with_my_weekend/,
1360390649.0,239,self.seduction,186jaj,So you want to improve yourself... Here are a few tips that I found help me feel better about myself.,298,59,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/186jaj/so_you_want_to_improve_yourself_here_are_a_few/,"Now this is more general self-improvement that seduction, though improving your self image can go a long way in how other people think of you. If you look down on yourself, other people will likely look down on you as well. So here are some of the things I did to get my head back into the game after losing a longtime girlfriend, along with a couple of other recommendations.


* **Stand up straight and look ahead,** not at the ground. It doesn't sound like much, but it can make a huge difference in how other people perceive you. You will appear more powerful and confident that way. 


* **Be stylish.** It doesn't have to be a total makeover, but dressing well can help your first impression. Look at what celebrities wear and imitate them. If you have a stylish female friend or cousins, etc. ask them if they can help you pick out a few new outfits. Find a simple haircut that suits you, and stick with it. Pick one out of a fashion magazine or website.
If you can, replace your glasses with contact lenses.


* **Take a public speaking class.** This is a valuable life skill, it will boost your confidence, and allow you to talk more clearly and smoothly. Taking classes is also a good way to meet new people.


* **Learn to dance.** Good dances to learn are West Coast Swing and Salsa. Hip hop dancing can be good to learn too, but remember, more guys can dance hip hop than can dance ballroom, and ballroom style is just as intimate, if not more so, than hip hop. If you take a class to learn, you'll meet new people.


* **Learn an instrument.** Most girls I've met like acoustic guitar and drums. Acoustic guitar, or even   ukulele, can be good options since they're easily portable. Once you can play an instrument, try learning to sing and play at the same time.


* **Work out,** find a scientific program you are comfortable with and STICK TO IT!


* **Play a sport.** It's exercise, and it will (if you're not terrible) boost your confidence, as well as expand your social circle. If you aren't into team sports, a martial arts class may be a good option. Learning to defend yourself will, of course, improve your self-confidence. Just don't go looking for fights, most girls hate and are embarrassed by that kind of behavior. 


* **Get a job.** People like guys who show some incentive and who aren't broke. You don't have bring home a huge paycheck, you just have to show that you aren't lazy and lacking in ambition.


* **Volunteer** if you have the time or are looking for a job. Whatever you volunteer for, it shows you have some civic spirit and you will meet new people. It also gives you references when you apply for work.


* **Learn to cook,** and not just in the microwave or out of a box. You can even structure a date around it if you invite her over to sample your cooking. There are lots of lessons on youtube, and infinite recipes online, however, my favorite way to learn was to have my grandmother teach me. You can spend quality time with your family and learn an important skill at the same time.

* **Learn how to give a quality massage.** This can be tricky, since one can got to school for several years in order to become a certified and licensed massage therapist, but there are simpler, shorter, and cheaper classes you can take, you just have to look hard enough. Of course, almost every girl will love a good massage.

* **Have self-confidence.** That doesn't mean be arrogant and brag about yourself. If you do a few of the things on this list, chances are you will begin to feel more confident, and it will carry over into other areas of your life, including girls.


TLDR: Learn new things, you won't regret it.

1318655975.0,238,self.seduction,lcwhi,How I Beat the Friend Zone,330,92,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/lcwhi/how_i_beat_the_friend_zone/,"**Edit**  reposted on the right account this time.  And i sounded like an ass so i cleaned it up a little.

So im going to start from the beginning.  I apologize in advance for length, this is my first post (on a novelty account obvi).    

It was september 2010, my first year in college and I am a computer science major.  In one of my programming classes there was a rather attractive female, ill call her HB10, who was really passionate about programming.  This was a fucking turn on for me.  I started talking to her and we quickly became study partners.  I would text her almost daily.  This was a big mistake.  I think she was into me nonetheless.  I finally got the balls to invite her over to my place to study instead of the library.  She fucking set up camp on my bed.  I sat at my desk like an IDIOT.  Didnt make a move.  Sat there imagining hooking up with her.  I had only made out with one other girl which is a funny fuckkkking afc story, but i digress.  

The school year came and went,  i texted this girl pretty often trying to get in another situation like that night in september.  She wasnt interested.  We still talked during class and were total friends.  But just friends.  Thats when i stumbled upon the Seddit community.  I read a lot.  I practiced kino and worked avidly to increase my self confidence, and landed some solid hookups.  But i still had über oneitis for HB10.  Then i decided it was time to move on,  there are billions of fish in the sea.

I decided i would stop communication with her, and I brushed off her 2 attempts to catch up via skype, said I was busy.  I worked hard over the summer and made some money and started working out a bit (i was scrawny).  Time to change the player, not the game.

Fast forward to this year.  I showed up to my first day of physics (Week of Sept 1)and guess who was in my class.  Keep in mind I got tanner, bulkier (im still scrawny), and a phresh new wardrobe.  She was so fucking stoked when she saw me and hugged me and shit.  She decided we are sitting together all quarter.  Her friend sat on the other side of me and she was fucking hot,  ill call her HB8.  Me being my new confident self, i compliment HB8 on a pin she had on her backpack that had FSM on it (Flying Spaghetti Monster, for those of you new to free thinking).  I made her laugh a bit and after lecture i #closed and set up a homework sesh at my new pad.  HB10 saw all this shit go down.

She sent me a text the first weekend saying we should hang out.  I told her i was busy all weekend with club activities, which was half true -- I knew what was going down, but i couldnt believe it, I thought the friend zone was like a fucking 40 man raid boss with a 10 man group of ret pallys. (WoW analogies 4 life)  I knew i had her intereest back, and I sure as shit wasnt gonna blow another opportunity.

I was finally able to pencil her in like 2 weeks ago.  We pumped out a program for our systems class and i showed her some of my projects (i wrote an android app over the summer - mega compsci DHV) and we hit a bowl out of my vape.  I decided to bust out a bottle of 2 buck chuck and we commenced our evening.  She saw my playstation 1 and asked if i had crash team racing.  I k-closed her right there. That was too much.  We made out for a solid 30 mins,  bit of foreplay and what not.  She asked if I wanted to bang, for lack of better words and context, and I motherfucking accepted the challenge.  Then we got our pillow talk on deep into the night.  I felt like a million bucks.  This girl was fucking great.  

I asked her out the next week, after debugging some bullshit assignment in the tech lab;  we have been going great for a week and a half, the sex is great,  and I'm fairly confident this will be a solid relationship (you never know though, obviously, but I'm hopeful).

The friend zone is in your head guys,  if you want to down fucking Nefarian and get that fucking dank 2handed sword, you have to start in fucking Zul Gurub to gear up.  Im sure you non wowers can interpret well enough.

A big thanks to this community, I currently have the capacity to masturbate to my life as it is right now.

I feel like a million bucks,  keep at it gents, you all need to feel what Im feeling.

Love you guys!   

Tl;dr - fuck you, this shit took like 3 beers and an hour of my time.

Get it innnnnnnn bros.

So a really interesting [post was made by blackhatseduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/102oz4/seddit_we_need_to_talk/) as to the quality of content here on r/seduction. I agree with everything he said. This subreddit has become too focused on Inner Game, and while Inner Game is very important, Outer Game is equally important. But as circumstance would have it, I have been organizing a training regimen for some other sedditors who really needed help. I had already written most of this when I saw his post and realized it addressed most of blackhat’s concerns.

My goal here is to organize the chaos of pick-up related content around the internet and turn it into a format from which people can derive lessons and learn pick-up step by step. As you read on you’ll find that I have broken down pick-up into different categories and sub-categories. Each subcategory will have related content pulled from third party sources to study. Let’s work together to make sense out of this chaos. *Please let me know what you guys think in the comments section.* If this is popular I will make regular updates with more recommendations/assignments to read up on.

So without further ado, please enjoy my first lesson: The Components of Pick-Up

**Mr. Right’s Seduction 101 - The Components of Pick-up**

In this lesson you’ll find that I have broken apart the venusian arts for you in a way that is easily understandable. I’ve even prioritized certain components, such as Kino and Eye-contact so that you know which parts should be worked on first. As you work through my lessons, I will include sources on gradually more “advanced” techniques, such as Qualification or Frame Control.

The reason I’m giving you all the sources, readings and advice is because it actually works. Let me tell you that this stuff has changed my life. This past weekend I hooked up with four girls in the last three days. If you apply yourself and believe in the change, then this will really work for you!

So let me breakdown the art of Pick-up for you. The key components to effective pick-up can essentially be broken down into two categories: “Inner Game” and “Outer Game.”

Inner Game is exactly as the name implies, it relates to your own mental self-perception and confidence. Without positive self-perception and confidence, the rest of this simply doesn’t work. This is the part that most students of the venusian arts have trouble with because when they start game, they often fail at first and it shatters their confidence. Then they give it up. This will not happen to you if you are truly willing to make a change within yourself and work hard to realize your potential. Let me reiterate, THIS IS NOT EASY OR SOME MAGIC PILL. You have to work-out, change the way you think and even change your lifestyle.

**Components of Inner Game**

1. Self-Confidence
2. Body Language / Posture
3. Outcome Independence
4. Frame Control

Then there is outer game. This deals with the techniques you employ during interactions with women. It takes a while to master all of these, but they are just as important as inner game (despite what others on r/seduction might say). Several PU masters have developed these techniques because they greatly increase your chances with women. They put you in control of these situations and allow you to make women putty in your hand.

**Components of Outer Game**

1. Kino Escalation (INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT)
2. Eye Contact (INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT)
3. Opening
4. Qualification
5. Frame Transference
6. Compliance Tests
7. Neuro-linguistic programing (Skeptical as to whether or not this works)
8. Last Minute Resistance Techniques
9. Bouncing
10. Demonstration of Higher Value
11. Logistics
12. Conversational Threading
13. Voice Control / Tonality
14. Social Circle Control

Got all that? Good! As you work with me, we will be going through all this vital information. I have assigned you some readings and videos to watch. I look forward to hearing back from you and I hope you keep me up to date on your progress.

I mean, yes, I am in one of the best education programs in the country, and yes I had many friends and was in a band. However, inside, I was empty. I was lonely. Hell, I wasn't even living.

 I had been in 2 relationships in the last 5 years, and I certainly never got laid much.....it did happen from time to time. I hit rock bottom, and I asked in relationship advice about what should I do. I got one reply, only one. It said, Come to Seddit.........so I did. I started by going over the basics, and I noticed that the main theme was putting yourself out there.

 So I did. I read how to approach, how to talk, and all that. However, for the longest time, I wasn't putting it to practice, I would just stay home, and usually drink in misery (Though I admit it was fun misery.). I got my first real time to practice when I got back to college at West Virginia University.

 I hit the ground running, just talking to everyone I met, male or female (I am bisexual, but regardless, I'm keeping my focus on women at the current moment.) I felt awkward, I got some rejection, but I got much more positive results than what I expected. Then one night, I find myself in bed with a Chinese foreign exchange student, double teaming her with my best friend.

I reflected on it, what I did to get her into me (At the start of the night, she was only into him.), combined it with the social lubrication of alcohol, and applied it the next female I encountered, and boy did I nail it (And her). I don't see what exactly has changed, but I know one thing. I am happy Seddit, something I was not before. I think I feel myself changing, and with that, my life. I thank you, with tears in my eyes, and from the bottom of my heart. I am a different man now Seddit, and I have it all to owe to you.

Tl;Dr: Seddit got me laid multiple times, and I'm so happy I have tears in my eyes.

Two weeks ago, my wing and I (I used to wing for him, but he's no longer single, so now he helps me out) went out to shoot some pool at some irish pub. Nothing planned beyond that. Halfway through our second game, I can FEEL the glances I'm getting from these two hispanic-looking girls near our table, an HB7 and an HB8 . After some light teasing, they both jumped in on for a team game (but of course, we made them wait til we finished ours, don't want to look too eager). While BS'ing in between shots, I learn that they are here in the U.S. on a working vacation, one from Brazil and one from Argentina. I speak spanish well enough to get by, so I drop a few lines here and there, which always get a huge smile out of the HB8. This girl looks vaguely like Penelope Cruz, and sounds even more so. Plus she had an amazing body. Anyway, we finish our second game, my buddy and I decide to go somewhere else, so I ask her how to let her know when we're going out again. Bam. Number close. No big.

Fast forward a week, my buddy is back home in Cali (I live in Seattle area), and I'm meeting with a group of friends in an area that is fraught with gay clubs. Penelope has agreed to come along as well, and wants to know if she can bring two of her girlfriends. Uh, yeah? Duh? So, the group who organized the meetup is running late, I'm running late, *everyone* is running late. I end up being the first one to the bar, and it's an hour after we were supposed to meet. So, I grab a drink, and make friends with people in my area, just passing time, until Penelope shows up, with her two friends (both from Colombia). They're... eh. I'd say about HB5 and 6.5. I immediately charm the shit out of them, and they're loving me, especially being the gringo who speaks Spanish. When I bring up how long they've known Penelope, they say they just met today. Penelope then informs me that (SURPRISE!) these aren't the two friends she meant. She has two MORE female friends coming. That's a total of 5 so far. (On a side note, the group of friends who organized everything never showed. Flaky bitches.)

I had to think of something, because while I am confident in my abilities, I don't know if I can handle 5 women on my own. Especially in a bar/club scene, women will get bored/distracted if there isn't someone there they can focus on. So I call up two male buddies of mine, give them the rundown, and they're in. They show up 30 min later. The night is going well, but we've been in the same place (which is really dark, loud, and crowded by this point) for a while, just waiting for the two other girls to make an appearance.

Finally, they arrive, and holy SHIT. These girls are HB8's on a bad day. One's from El Salvador, and the other is Colombian. The Salvadoran is a 9.5, absolutely stunning. At this point, my buddies are ecstatic, and get to work keeping the girls entertained. I continue to focus on Penelope. I make an executive decision to change venues, and suggest a gay club nearby. They've never been to one, so they're intrigued. 10 minutes later, we're all on the dance floor, acting a fool, having a gay old time. I go back to the bar to get another drink, and start chatting with some guy at the bar (we'll call him Chad). Chad's fucking hilarious. He's like me, only gayer and better-looking. I invite Chad back to our group, and he comes along, keeping the frumpier-looking friends happy. 

About an hour into this, everyone is feeling pretty buzzed, and we all end up outside to take a break. Chad covertly asks me if I'm going after Penelope, which I am, so he works his gay magic. He nonchalantly melds back into the group, we head back in, and he buys Penelope a drink while we head back out to the dance floor.

I have no idea what he said, but this girl came back with a vengeance. She starts dancing very close, planting the occasional peck on my neck/cheek every few minutes. I sneak a glance at Chad, who gives me a thumbs-up with a devilish grin. This continues on for the remainder of the evening, until the club is about to close. As we are all standing out front, making sure everyone has rides and whatnot (side note: I managed to snag HB9.5's number at this point, too), I let Penelope know I'm leaving, and slightly opened my arms as if to say ""where's my hug?"" She jumps up and wraps her arms around me, and we start making out right there on the spot. I was pleasantly surprised. :D She wants to hang out again next weekend.

I still have no idea what Chad said.

**TL;DR: K-closed Penelope Cruz with the help of a wonderful gay man.**

**EDIT 2: Sadly, no, I did not get the Chad's number. 20/20 hindsight and all that. He was a phenomenal wingman.**

I especially appreciate the advice that points out that women are afraid if they sleep with a man on the first date that they will be treated poorly or thought of as undesirable.  Being aware of another human being's thoughts and feelings is important, and I wasn't really expecting to find that sort of thing in a subreddit devoted to teaching men basic seduction skills.

Though I have to say on principle that putting women on a rating scale promotes thinking of them as objects, I can't really scold anyone for that.  I do it too.  It is normal thing.  Just remember that there is a complex person behind that number, and she could be more intelligent or more fucked up than you are expecting.  It is a HUGE turn off when a guy approaches me with the assumption that I am brain dead.

Men who follow the better advice in this subreddit are more attractive, because they have taken the time to improve their appearance, fortify their egos, and engage in their lives.  Being clean, fit, and happy is quite alluring.

##Rules / Guidelines
***

The primary focus of Seddit (/r/seduction) is the study of human seduction. Mainly, how to integrate specific seduction and self-improvement techniques into our long-term personalities and how to succeed at forming successful romantic relationships.

While the discussions within Seddit focus primarily on the male seduction of females, most techniques and information referenced may be flexibly utilized in all types of relationships. Male --&gt; female will be assumed in examples below. 

When evaluating if a post is appropriate, the golden rule is to ask yourself: *""Does this post help guys meet women?""* 

##Appropriate Topics
***

### * FR's

Great field reports focus on the **techniques, mindsets and phrases** you
 specifically used that changed the course of the night to being successful.
If FR is a failure, then be sure you can point out specifically what would 
have turned it into a success. 
A good FR says *""This is what I did, and why it worked""*. 

While we appreciate functional Field Reports, often users post what are
essentially diaries, giving a rundown of the night without any focus on
actual techniques used. For instance:

| I went to the starbucks today, and smiled at cashier, but got too nervous to say anything so I just left.

This doesn't do anything to help guys meet women. Share positive value with
the community, this keeps the sub filled with useful material! Begin your FR with a topic starting with '**[FR]**'

### * Links to Articles / Videos
There are tons of great blogs, vlogs, podcast, forums, and articles about
seduction, and we love to stay up to date on what is out there in the
community. Post these if you find them useful!

However, if the video is more about fun (like approaching while holding a
dildo), it might be removed because it isn't a good example of actually
helping guys meet women. Also, videos of friendzoned guys or guys bad at
pickup might not be allowed if they violate the golden rule of ""Does this
help guys meet women?""

### * Sharing Techniques
If you have come up with your own techniques, **SHARE THEM!!!**. We rely on
the community for new approaches and ideas, just make sure they are field
tested with at least 20 approaches.


### * Asking specific questions, intermediate and above
While the subreddit can become clogged with questions like ""How do I approach"" or ""How do I kiss a girl?"", more advanced topics can provide a rich discussion. Examples:

* How do I juggle multiple women?
* How do I bounce women within first 45 minutes to my place?
* Best way to arrange a threesome?
* Struggling with a specific aspect of inner-game
* Advanced Linguistic Techniques (NLP)

##Common Inappropriate Posts
***

### * Overly Broad / Beginner Topics
Things like:

* How do I approach
* How do I get a number
* I'm in college, how do I talk to girls
* How to kiss a girl

Without specifics, there is not much help we can give than ""Read the
sidebar"". The sidebar and beginner materials covers the basics from how to
meet a stranger, get her number, get a day2 and attract / seduce her to the
bedroom. This basic sequence does not need constant discussion. **tl;dr RTFM**

### * Physical Limitation
Great guide on [**Why Looks Don't Matter**](http://redd.it/yhna6). This is an
answered question, proven over and over. No need to re-ask it.

### * Will this work for me? Depressed / Awkward
Short answer: **YES!!!**

Many of the guys that have transformed their lives started as some of the
most awkward, FA people you have ever met. While this is not substitute for
professional psychiatric help (and if that is the case, you should start
there), practically any guy capable of communicating with others should be
able to put this to use. 

Study the sidebar and beginner text, and if you are strugggling after 3
months of serious work, then you can post about what specifically isn't
working. Don't make a post until you've put in the foundational reading and work in. 

### * Asking for Advice
Any calls for specific situational advice with a specific female should be
directed to /r/askSeddit. Note that is ask**SEDDIT**, not ask**REDDIT**.

It exists to give you a place where sedditors can answer your questions
without bogging down the frontpage of /r/seduction. 

The problem with these topics is they are specific to **YOUR** situation,
while broad pickup topics are applicable to **EVERY** guys situation. We have
80,000 readers, and focus of sub is to help everyone.  

### * Rage Comics / Failure links
In short, things like rage comics, stuff about FA guys or friendzoned losers
are not appropriate, and will be deleted. Simply making fun of the community
or guys that aren't good with women does nothing to **HELP** guys with women. 

### * Commercial Advertisement 

Seddit is not an advertisement forum, and any information posted should be aimed at helping progress our member's abilities in the arts of seduction. A specific reason why the link is helpful to sedditors should be accompanied in the post or in a comment.

Links should be made to actual content, rather than advertising a book or simple a website's homepage. Any blatant advertisement of products that cost money without prior approval from moderators can be met with deletion.

##Comment specific rules
***

Attacking (flaming) any member will get either a warning or a ban at the moderators discretion. Calling any member a rapist, insinuating anything negative about their character because they practice seduction, or just plain name calling are all forbidden.

If you think the post isn't helpful, then report it to the moderators. Do not go in and call the OP names. 

##Celebrity / Industry AMA
***

Please contact and schedule these through moderators. We maintain a numbered list of Official AMA's, and for inclusion you must schedule with moderators. Furthermore, AMA are often the source of flaming and attacks from hostile subreddits, so we schedule moderators to be online for the AMA to control these. If these are not scheduled through the mod team and these attacks occur, the entire thread might get removed.

All AMA's must follow the reddit standard:

* Questions are answered in real time, not hours later. Make the AMA **when you will be at the keyboard**.
* Questions must be answered on reddit, in the thread. Not youtube, not on a blog.
* Be prepared to answer any question, not just commercial ones.
* Have fun!",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1357660639.0,,,True,t3_10ioux,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/10ioux/xmodx_updated_seddit_rules_posting_guidelines/,moderator
1339259376.0,237,self.seduction,utb44,"The elements of Seduction; Attraction, Comfort, Sexual Interest - A brief overlook",280,43,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/utb44/the_elements_of_seduction_attraction_comfort/,"I believe the best indicator for self-development is utilised through seducing women. I'm not going to tell you how to become an alpha (or whatever you call the guy with a good life), but I will be talking about my interpretation of the 'structure' to successful practice.

(I'd also like to point out, I've been studying since febuary, applying since march, succeeding since april, working in may, and enjoying myself again)

Seduction is the action of enticing someone in such a way that they feel compelled to comply and engage themselves in a romantic nature with the seducer.
 
Seduction consists of three things:

-	Attraction
-	Comfort
-	Sexual interest

Its essential to build upon these three criteria’s in order to effectively ‘seduce’ a girl

**Attraction**

Attraction is created when an individual comes across as interesting, positive, fun, confident and desirable. Essentially these are mutual characteristics with what we define as Alpha, again stressing why I believe through seduction we demonstrate ourselves as Alpha’s.

-Interesting

The ability to come across as interesting is almost as ambiguous as the art of seduction itself, however there are ways to better show your intent of interest. It is very important to remember:

*The most interesting man in the room is not the man who tells the most stories, but the man who listens intently to others and rebuttals to further propel these ideas, offering consideration and appreciation to the other party*

It is essentially to show your interest for others to make allow others to see you as interesting, of course this changes when you’re telling a story about ‘how you wrestled that family of sharks’ or whatever, but remember to come across as interesting you need to become GENUINLY interested in others.

-Positive

Positivity (which I would like to point out I despise that word) is best defined through someone who is happy, care-free, uncritical and has the ability to express pleasure. It is vital to point out ‘smiling’ and animating your emotions are important in building and showing this flare.
 
I cannot stress enough how important it is to be non-critical, ‘negging’ is a different thing entirely; the only time it is allowed to be critical of others is when your clearly ‘teasing’ them, but be sure your both having......

-Fun

To be fun is to show an independency of judgement from others (a.k.a. not giving a fuck) and to clearly show that you’re having a good time. Again it is vital to point out ‘smiling’ and animating your emotions are essentially to build this kind of frame.

-Confident

To be confident is to voice what you think, and be certain of yourself irrelevant of others. Confidence is one of the more defining principles of being an Alpha as it is the tool which ultimately allows you to express your other traits. Confidence in yourself is what will mostly set you apart from the others, who end up as a extras in movies and have to dance for their peanuts.

-Desirable

To be recognised as desirable is to own the room, not just the one interaction your engaged in. Showering yourself in female attention works wonders, fun female wings will make you glow!


**Comfort**

Comfort is more often than not the easier of the three to build upon, however it is also dangerous in the sense that too much comfort and not enough *sexual interest* will lead to being friend zoned (which isn’t such a bad thing at all, greatly undervalued on seddit in my opinion.)

To build comfort is to establish a connection with someone such that they trust you to be themselves around without the fear of rejection. It’s crucial to remember every bit of information they choose to reveal when building comfort (their name, what they studied at university, where they are from etc.) and use these resources of conversation; check out conversation threading, and when you get better you'll effortlessly find a *natural flow* in your interaction (and you won't be interviewing them!)

**Qualification**

I would like to also make a point on qualification; it benefits both attraction and comfort, through asking questions which require  substance/ context from the girl. Qualification should show that you’re interested beyond sexual intentions, again being cautious of getting into the ‘friend-zone’. The purpose is to better get to know each other, as well as building momentum towards future interactions (as she will feel both more comfortable around you and more interested/attracted to you).
 
Qualification should be used when enough ‘compliance’ has been built to make the girl either justifying her self-want OR telling you about herself (you have the power to put whichever spin on this). 

Mystery’s ‘infamous’ question is always solid: *So what have you got going for you more than your looks?* – However it is important to not come across as aggressive or malicious in these questions, an other aim is to make the girl feel comfortable being vulnerable with you, so DON’T throw it back in her face if she tells you she likes collecting unicorn figures.

Don’t ask too many questions, really work with the information you get as otherwise it will become an interview. (Bait-Hook-Reel-Release)

**Sexual interest**

By far the most delicate trait to put across in a cold interaction; to display sexual interest is to show the girl you ‘want’ her and to get her to reciprocate the intention. 

-	Displaying Sexual interest too early = you look like a creep/afc/every other guy

-	Displaying sexual interest too late = she has already decided that for the night you’re not a sexually appealing (a.k.a. friendzone)

So it is paramount to be delicate when showing sexual interest. Too do this make good use of kino (I feel like I’m really going on a bit, so I won’t cover everything), extended eye contact, sexual tension. Sexual interest is ambiguous and its probably more felt that thought about; although kino esculation is essential

My personal recommendations to read upon: DiCarlo esculation ladder, Everything tofu mentions in the sidebar about being an alpha/ innergame (I swear half of all questions can be answered from that damn sidebar), conversation threading, how to win friends and influence people (carnigie), Sinn,

1335978182.0,236,self.seduction,t3ipf,Advice from a 40-year-old Vietnamese-American natural: One of the most attractive attributes anyone can have.,299,63,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/t3ipf/advice_from_a_40yearold_vietnameseamerican/,"I've been blessed to meet another natural. This guy was a late-bloomer who got into the game in his late 20's. Unlike most Asian Americans, he chose to not settle down right away, and completely recommends I do the same. He said that his 30's have been the best time of his life, and that many people are under the impression that life ends when you turn 30. Not true. The guy is extremely physically fit, takes care of his body (in a non-metrosexual way), exudes the self-confidence of a lion, is fairly short, extremely intelligent, and awesome body language. He's at the point in his life where he's on the fence of settling down for the woman he loves or continue searching. Anyway, he told me a few things that I need to improve on, and I thought his advice would be enlightening for you guys:

**Low Frequency**. If women could choose two men that are exactly the same, but one is average height and the other is slightly above average height, they'd generally pick the taller guy. In the same way women generally prefer physically fit guys over fat guys. Richer guys over poorer guys. Guys who dress well over poorly clothed guys. Everyone knows this. However, something that isn't stressed, but similarly true is that women prefer a low frequency guy over a high frequency guy.  Low frequency is probably the most important attribute to have for attraction, keeping women happy, and keeping yourself healthy and stress-free.


**What does low frequency mean?** A lot of times guys are told it's good to be the life of the party, funny, outgoing, entertaining, etc. However, while this might pique interest in many women, what's more attractive is a man who is generally low frequency. This means walking fast by taking longer strides, slowing down your responses to stuff people say to you, letting your smile come out slowly over several seconds instead of doing a quick grin, looking a girl in the eyes while she's talking to you without any fidgeting, chewing your food slowly and really tasting and enjoying it, actually listening to the words coming out of your mouth.

**Listen to the words coming out of your mouth.** Don't just respond to what is said to you. Speak slower and actually listen to each and every word you say as if you are listening to someone else speaking to you. Try this for second. You become very self-conscious of how much filler-language your brain spews, and how little of it is meaningful. If you take the time to listen to the words you speak, all the words you say will be much more valuable. If all you say are valuable words, people will listen to you, value what you say, and want to give you the time of day.  Think of every famous, popular, and attractive man. Low frequency.

**No more monologues.** Most people say what they are thinking when the speak. This is monologue-mode. This is how the vast majority of people communicate: two parallel monologues instead of a listen-think-respond communication pattern. Listen to the words coming out of your mouth. Is what you're going to say valuable, or is it just filler coming from your brain's internal monologue?

**High-frequency isn't always bad.** It's sometimes great to let your brain's autopilot takeover and react without care for anything other than how you feel, what your brain's internal monologue is saying, and physically jitter around. Generally, being temporarily high frequency when something good happens is a good thing. People love how players act when someone scores a goal in soccer. It's also occasionally necessary to be high-frequency to get many things done in a short amount of time, at work for example.

**But too much high-frequency is draining.** Ironically, if you are exuding too much energy, you might pique interest in someone you approach initially. However, this will quickly devolve into the person wishing you would just shut up and leave him/her alone. My friend told me that he used to think it was necessary to be the wittiest person in the group and tell awesome stories, especially in trying to get girls. However, he said that the less he said, only speaking when it was truly valuable did many more wonders than trying to be the best speaker in a group. He asked me to look at people, and you can see who is high and low frequency pretty easily if you're looking at this attribute. If you engage a high-frequency person, they ironically will take away energy from you rather than the other way around.

**The less you care the more stuff happens.** He told me the less he cared about entertaining people, trying to be energetic, etc. the more girls came. He cared even less, and even more girls came. He is not an asshole. He is not a nice guy. He is very observant of people and only accepts good people into his life. He is extremely successful in life, and takes this no-care low-frequency attitude to everything, not just with girls. In a couple of words: outcome independence.

**Women, in general, want to be with a low frequency guy in the long-term.** If you are looking to start a healthy relationship with a woman, listen to this advice. High-frequency game might get you laid, but a long-lasting relationship will get to be draining if you are always easily excitable, fidgety, reactive, monologue-speaking, etc.

**An Excercise to get low-frequency**: Sit in a comfortable chair. Close your eyes. Listen to your breathing.  Shift all of your focus to your right eye for several seconds. Then shift all of your focus to your left eye. Then shift all of your focus to your mind's eye, a little above your eyebrows and an inch inside of your head. Keep doing this. See how you feel after a few minutes. Your shoulders should become relaxed, posture improved, no fidgeting, etc.

**Is it true?** I had to think about his advice for a while.  To me, Tyler Durden seems to be a high frequency guy off the bat.  But after re-watching some of his videos, I realized he's a low-frequency guy with a lot of energy.  He is in absolute control of his body and body language, and allows his high-frequency self to come out when he gets excited.  However, he doesn't run on auto-pilot.  Everything he says is filled with meaning, intent, and determination.  So personally, I think my friend's advice is correct.

**TLDR**:  Be low-frequency, and you will be more attractive to women across the board.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_t3ipf,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/t3ipf/advice_from_a_40yearold_vietnameseamerican/,
1333027952.0,233,self.seduction,rj6yg,"How to improve yourself each day, become outcome independent, and love life no matter what it throws at you.",289,56,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/rj6yg/how_to_improve_yourself_each_day_become_outcome/,"So, I had an idea. It's not really revolutionary... Actually, it's pretty obvious, but I think it might make a big difference for a lot of people. Let me explain.



We're all here to improve ourselves, right? Right. We all have some sort of idea about where we want all this to take us, right? Almost. Most people don't really know what their goal is. Sure, they know they want to start seeing some results with women, or something equally vague, but they don't *really* know what they're working towards. They're just hoping that if they keep this stuff up, maybe something will one day click and they'll suddenly be living a life that would make their past self envious. Thing is, that's not going to happen by accident.

I'm not denying that these guys are making improvements in their lives - they're doing plenty of things right and their commitment to self-improvement is something truly commendable - but the progress they're making is just a side effect of what they're doing, and eventually it's going to stop. Then it becomes apparent that they've been basing their self-worth on the progress they managed to make, and the positive feedback it earned them. Now they're stuck at a plateau, frustrated that they aren't improving like they once were, beginning to question whether they really achieved anything at all. It's a shitty situation to be in, but it's easily fixed. The fact of the matter is that these guys lack direction. They're trying everything in the hope that something will provide the solution they're looking for, when all they needed to do was focus. Decide where you want to be; figure out how you're going to get there; then start walking.

Do you start driving your car without knowing where you're going? No. You know where you want to be and you use the knowledge you've acquired to make the correct turns to get there. Don't know how to reach your destination? You seek external help in the form of a map. You learn a new set of directions, and from that point onwards you're able to apply them as and when you need them.

If you found yourself lost in the middle of a giant forest, you could try walking in one direction for a bit, then change your mind and try another one, and then another one. You could waste your final few days wandering around, barely committing to any one plan of action in the hope that by some miracle one of your half-baked ideas would save you. Or you could pick one direction and stick to it. Walk in a straight line. Sure, it might not be the quickest way out of the forest. You might face some pretty daunting obstacles on your way. Shit, you might have been 100 metres from the edge of the forest in the other direction, but you sure as hell weren't going to find that out wandering around aimlessly. You decided on your path, stuck to it despite any challenges that arose, and achieved your goal. Focus and persistence. This is my point.



Now, I've rambled quite a bit and so far have managed to fulfil none of the promises I made in the title of this post. Nor have I told you my idea. I'll be honest - that was an accident. I was just having way too much fun thinking of analogies.



My idea is simple - every day set yourself three achievable goals, and then, um, you achieve them. You don't just pick the goals at random, though, otherwise you're just aimlessly wandering. The goals stem from your **priorities**. You need to decide on what is truly important to you in life, and why. These priorities could themselves be goals, or they could be principles, morals or ideologies by which you try to live, they could be based in friendships or relationships, or attitudes towards the world. Whatever form they take is personal to you. What is universal is that they are at the core of everything you do, everything you think, everything you say, everything you believe. You must pick priorities in which you passionately believe.

Pretty simple, right? You decide what you want from life, and then every day you take three steps towards achieving these things.



Do you see how this ties in with the promises in the title?



It's pretty obvious how this will help you improve yourself each day. If you stick to it, you don't really have a choice but to improve in some way every day.



But what about becoming outcome independent? It's pretty simple really - if you feel like shit because a woman rejected you, it's your fault for allowing that to make you feel like shit, not hers for rejecting you. You're basing your self-worth and your perception of your own value on the results of an interaction with a completely irrelevant third party. What if you then found out she had a rare but serious mental condition that caused her to always reject men whose dick she wanted to suck there and then, but that also caused her to be unable to tell anyone about it? You probably wouldn't feel like shit then. You'd feel pretty great knowing that she wanted to drop to her knees on the spot. But wait a minute, in both of these hypothetical situations you did the exact same thing. Literally the only thing that changed is your perception of the woman's reaction. You're allowing yourself to feel shitty over the exact same set of actions that could have earned you some mentally unstable head. Do you see how stupid that is? The outcome of your actions is completely beyond your control, so why allow it to affect how you feel? Outcome independence is what happens when you become fully aware that you can only control your own actions. Everything else is utter chaos to which you can only react in the moment with no attachment to either future or past events. Having priorities at the core of everything you do allows you to create your own value. When you are truly passionate about them you will never need to seek external value or approval again.

I also promised that this exercise will help you love life. It will make you happy if you do it correctly. Nothing will fill you with happiness, self-love and value like setting and achieving a goal.



To summarise:

* Decide on your priorities. The things you want at the core of your life, defining who you are. Everything you do from now on is due to one of your priorities.  
* Set three goals every day. Achieve three goals every day.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_rj6yg,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/rj6yg/how_to_improve_yourself_each_day_become_outcome/,

I was going through some old RSD posts, since I am pretty much still learning, this made a lot of sense to me as someone who is still very new to club/night game. I am not sure of the etiquette of linking to other sites, so I have posted the text from the blog. It is from an ex-RSD instructor Ryan. The original link is included at the bottom. 

----------------------------------------
Hey Fellas,

Doing bootcamp week-in and week-out, it doesn’t take long to notice some clear patterns in guys who are new to the game – simple mistakes guys make that can be fixed in a snap. Below are a few of the most common sticking points I see in beginners that can be easily addressed and once in order will definitely lead to noticeably better results. 

**Approach Scanning** – This takes place before the approach even happens… the guy scans the room looking for a girl to talk to, sees a girl he’s attracted to, then comes up with all the reasons why not to approach. “She’s with a guy…she’s too tall… she’s in a bad mood”. Well, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, so instead of seeking out all the reasons why not to approach, let your thought process be this: “Girl…Hot Girl…Get Hot Girl.”

**The Decaying Orbit** – Here we’ve got a guy who’s decided to approach, but instead of making a straight line to his target and opening dominantly, he instead sort of circles around – gradually edging in and finally trying to initiate with a timid tap. YUK. When I see a girl I want, I am A MAN ON A MISSION. Nothing will come between me and her, and she knows it. Move dominantly and with purpose…let her see you’re a man who goes after what he wants… a man who grabs the proverbial bull by the horns. 

**The Far Talker** – Any guesses as to what distance you want to be when talking to girls (in a club)? The answer is about 1 head length…this is a LOT closer than you think. Get comfortable being close. 

**Going Interview Mode** – Game is expression of self. If the spotlight is on her then by default it means self-expression is at a minimum. Go first – put yourself out there and let her follow your lead. So it’s not “What do you like to do?” instead go first and let her follow… “I’m really into snowboarding” will usually be followed by her reciprocating by telling you what she’s into. Share your opinion… don’t be some impartial reporter, let her know what you think “that’s really weird…that reminds me of the time I…” 



**Growing Roots** – Guys, it’s not “let’s stand here and talk for 2 hours then go back to mine.” It just doesn’t work like that…it’s more like “Let’s go to the bar…now let’s go dance… now let’s go chill…now let’s go back to the bar… now let’s go outside…now let’s go chill…now let’s grab something to eat…now let’s go back to mine.” Get her into the habit of following you on the little things first, before you go for the big ones. This also leads into our next point:

**Fighting Against the Current**: Look, if you’re talking to a girl and you see her standing there with an empty drink I got news for you – she’s gonna go to the bar at some point. You can only hold her in one place for so long before she gets thirsty. Likewise if a girl tells you she loves to dance… you’re only going to be able to keep her on the sofa for so long before she leaves to go dance. If you see a girl glancing around to see where her friends are… she’s going to want to find her friends no matter how charming you are. Instead of working against the current and trying to hold her, let her momentum work with you. Meaning, when I see a girl’s drink is empty I say “I’m thirsty, come with me to the bar”. When you see a girl looking around to see where her friends are, pre-empt her walking off to find them – “Hey, we haven’t seen your friends in a while…let’s go see where they went.” Really, what’s she gonna say…”No”?? “Fuck you”???

**Spinning the Wheels** – Ok so you’re at the club, girl is in a party mood and she REALLY likes you. Well, I don’t care how interesting you are, you can only have a friendly conversation for so long before it gets BORING. Or, even worse, before she thinks you’re a prude that’s scared to escalate. This is SOOOO common, guy likes girl, girl likes guy… guy and girl talk for an hour…guy does nothing to escalate either physically or verbally, guy and girl go their separate ways. Girl concludes guy doesn’t like her, feels insecure, develops eating disorder. 

**Filler Speak** – This is where the guy is scared to reveal himself and his own thoughts and feelings, so instead he seeks to fill the conversation using external stimulus, “yeah the lighting in this bar is really cool… oh the DJ is pretty good tonight…yeah I’m drinking a vodka tonic.” Quit hiding – say what’s really on your mind.

**Not Communicating Interest** – I’ll make this simple. A girl won’t like you until you like her. A girl doesn’t know you like her until you TELL HER you like her. This can take place verbally or non-verbally – but if you have a problem with this make a resolution right now that the next 100 girls you talk to will get told either “you’re hot”, “you’re sexy”, or “I like you”. PERIOD. NO EXCEPTIONS. 

**No Physicality** – Simply put, get VERY comfortable being physical. How? Just be VERY TOUCHY. Practice makes perfect…it’s not rocket science. 

**Assuming It’s Not On** – ARGH, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen a guy walk away from a girl that likes him only to say “really? You think she was into me?” after I point out the obvious. Guys – if she’s talking to you she’s interested. It’s that simple. To be clear – She is into you unless she makes it blatantly clear otherwise. 

**Ignoring the Friends** – Take a moment to introduce yourself and chat to her friends, this will make your job much easier down the line. 

**Not Trying for the Close** – assume you’re closing, get verification one way or the other. No exceptions. 

And lastly…

**Giving a Fuck What Other People Think** – Repeat after me…”I DO NOT GIVE A FUCK WHAT ANYONE THINKS ABOUT ME”. Good… now say it like you mean it. 

Cheers,
Ryan

1351655948.0,236,self.seduction,12dqs4,Most girls at bars/clubs are not with the guy they're talking to.,307,71,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12dqs4/most_girls_at_barsclubs_are_not_with_the_guy/,"A lot of guys get frustrated early on when they go out and have a hard time finding a girl not already chatting with a guy. But odds are, she's not with him. By ""with him"" I mean either in a relationship with him or there as a date.

You know who he is? He's you. He's a random dude chatting with her until he gets blown out or closes. And sometimes he's a friend she's not interested in or an orbiter she's out with just because she's bored.

The number of guys who are actually with the girl is about 25-35%. This is based both on my own experience opening a zillion sets, as well as the experience of other guys with a ton of experience (it was a big topic several years ago, and many other PUAs confirmed that about 2/3 to 3/4 of guy weren't actually with the girl they were talking to).

Of course there's a caveat. It depends on where and when. If it's a raucous sports bar, she's probably there to spend time with her boyfriend. If it's a club on a Saturday night? Not quite as likely. Come on, when was the last time you *took* a girl *to* a club? Probably never. You pull from them, you don't take girls there. It's the hookup-friendly environment where this rule applies.

When you go into a club, just look at the line outside. How many mixed groups do you see? Not that many. It's three dudes together, and three girls together, not three guy-girl couples in line.

So now, what to do with this information?

Right off the bat, keep it in mind to not get discouraged. Keep your radar stations active so you can spot when a guy gets blown out. Also, don't just see a mixed 2set and then move you attention elsewhere. Take a few moments to observe them. Is she laughing? Is she looking around the room to find her friends? Seeing how guys and girls interact from the outside is tremendously helpful.

As for whether you should open a mixed 2set, that's really up to your style and skills. Some guys don't like to interfere with another guy's game. Other guys don't think that the guy has any special claim to her just for talking to her. You never heard him call shotgun, right? I think both positions are reasonable, and I'm not going to tell you how to feel about it. Being polite to other guys has pretty clear merits, but then again, I'm way more interesting than that dude, so why make her suffer through him just because he got there first? That's not fair to her.

The more interesting issue though, for people who don't mind blowing out another guy, is how to tell. And that's why inspired me to write this post. Cosmo has a new article on non-verbal signals guys send to say they're in love. Now, Cosmo is generally a load of bunk, and I've even made a few bucks lampooning them for College Humor, but this one thing is spot on: If a guy is standing next to a girl, they've got something going on.

Think about how you're positioned when opening a stranger and how you are when you're with a girl you're in a relationship with. When you're opening a set you're often facing the girl head on or forming a 90 degree angle. (And if you're facing her head on, you're doing it wrong, and the whole arrangement will feel confrontational to her, like you're delivering a sales pitch. There's a bunch of negotiation theory about this.) When you're with a girl, you sidle up next to her to be closer, and so you're both facing the same direction, allowing you to look at the same thing, talk to the same people, etc.

So, when you're scanning a room looking for someone to approach, keep in mind that more than half the guys there aren't with the girl they're talking to, they're just *trying* to get with her. And, the more head-on the interaction is, the more likely it is they aren't together, and the closer to being side-by-side they are, the more likely it is they are together. And finally, try not to put yourself in the head-on arrangement. It's uncomfortable for her, probably uncomfortable to you, and will signal to other guys that you're not with her and that they should rescue her from you. Don't sidle up next to her right away, but go for something more like a 90 or 75 degree angle.

**Introduction**

This instruction is the culmination of over 4 years of experience and training in the “seduction community”, my experiences before &amp; after learning Game, and military training for leadership &amp; public speaking. 

* [Full course syllabus](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/kwcpy/free_training_course_for_those_in_the_dcmaryland/c2nr6y2)

**Logistics &amp; Investment**

Logistics are the single most important aspect of finding success. It means having proximity to women you desire. Placing yourself in situations where you are around the women you want to be with, and in environments where escalation is possible, is what it’s all about. Just putting yourself into these situations, regardless of your skill with women, will improve one’s odds of being successful.  Logistics can also make or break an interaction, and is one of the few things we have total control over in many respects. All it takes is a little foresight and preparation. However, there are situations where bad logistics can also break a perfect situation no matter what you do. This is why preparation is key, so to avoid problems in the first place as much as possible. Good logistics can also benefit you in a variety of ways, which is discussed in class.
Investment is the second half of this equation in that the more you’re around someone, the more invested in each other the two of you become, assuming you are putting in equal effort in the interaction. The key here is that the person who is least invested holds all the cards. If you can get a woman talking and sit back and let her talk, yourself being minimally involved, she’ll be more invested than you are. This is great for men and it’s very empowering. Ideally though, investment levels should be about even. If you over invest though you risk coming across as needy or clingy, so for the purpose of training you should look to keep your investment level lower than those you are interacting with.



**Comfort &amp; Rapport**

Comfort is key when approaching. If the person isn’t comfortable with your presence then you’re fighting an uphill battle. The goal when you first approach should be to make them as comfortable as possible. If you are nervous, they’re going to respond in kind. 
Rapport is comfort plus a level of familiarity. You need to build this before you can break rapport (not sever it) as breaking rapport is also known as something else….flirting. 
Metagame &amp; Propinquity

Metagame is the overall framework of the social interaction at large. It’s the birds-eye-view, top level knowledge of the playing field, so to speak. Approaching the hottest girls in the club from across the bar, passing by other people you could have talked to, but then going indirect with those hotties simply betrays your intentions and makes you look wussy. 

Propinquity is what gives us our perceived value to others. In the context of this course it can be best thought of as a mixture of preselection and social proof. Another factor in all of this is the mere exposure effect, which is why having good logistics (in the sense of being around the women you desire) is so much better than merely cold approaching all the time.

**Verbal &amp; Non-verbal communications**

Verbal communication means your inflection, tone, cadence, and so on. What you say isn’t nearly as important as how you say it. Being comfortable talking to strangers and “holding court” takes time and practice. I strongly suggest joining Toastmasters as this is what they’re all about.  
Non-verbal communications are largely comprised of eye contact, touch, body language and positioning such as mirroring and matching head height. Non-verbal communications are far more impactful in social interactions as they convey our true interests and comfort level, as well as playing a part in building comfort &amp; intimacy. 

One of the biggest problems I’ve seen is that people have an aversion to making good eye contact, which is a shame because this is a critical key to attraction and escalation. If you have problems with this, again, check out Toastmasters. An easy way to practice on your own though is to force yourself to make eye contact when walking past people. Look at someone you’re passing as you walk in opposite directions at about 10-15’ away. Look at their eyes and try to note their eye color. Say hi or give them a head-nod and keep moving. After a while you’ll develop a feel for how much eye contact is too much or not enough, eventually getting it just right. Experience is the key. As a rule of thumb, until you find out what’s right for you, try to maintain eye contact for about 2-3 heartbeats.

When approaching, touch is also critical. Escalation starts from the moment you meet. When you approach, a touch on the woman’s arm before you speek, is an amazing tool for getting someone’s attention. 3 fingers on her forearm for just a moment to get her attention is all that’s needed. Another option is the back of the hand. I’ll go more into physical escalation later, but for approaching this is all that’s necessary.

My girlfriend was walking in the hall and some guy came up to her and without even talking or getting to know her name or anything, just told her to put her number in his phone. She obviously declined and then he kept following her around the hall for a little while. 

Guys, if you ever do this trick, be sure you at least get to know the girl a little bit before just handing her your phone.

Edit: I did not expect this much attention on this topic. To all the guys that think I have trust issues or something, I really don't. I'm just saying that this whole trick seems stupid, especially if you just hand your phone to the girl without at least starting a short conversation. I just thought about making this topic since I never saw someone do it outside the internet and how terribly it worked out.

About a month ago I met with this HB7, while only a HB7 I sensed that she was a wild cat in bed.  So in the past month or so we exchanged emails back and forth, we could not find a suitable time to meet etc... till last night she caught me on Fb and started to chat.
I don't like to do that, but I said *what the hell* and we started to chat at first about boring stuff, then I put on my /r/seduction hat on (figuratively speaking) and I started to probe into her personality to which she responded very well.  About half an hour into it she was really into it, I was flirting with her and she was flirting back... at one point it almost went into cybersex but I played dumb since I didn't want to go there.

At the 30 min mark (I set a timer) I told her that I had to go do some work and told her *This is fun, I wish we could continue but face to face*

*me too* she replied

*my entire week is crazy with meeting and I will be out of town at the end of the week* I said *how about tomorrow morning. Coffee?*

We go back and forth, she says no that she can't, so I tell her it will have to be next week and that probably it's going to be another month like that one that just passed... to make a long story short, she moved a work meeting and skipped the gym to meet me for coffee.

So this morning I arrive at Starbucks, early as usual.
Recently I was reading something on /r/seduction that suggests to *take space* and I must say it works for me. Although it's hot, I brought a blazer, so I get my coffee, and grab a table, one of those large tables and 4 chairs, one chair for me, one for her, and I spread my stuff all over the table and the other 2 chairs: bag, laptop, books, coffee cup, napkins, sugar, you name me, I am taking a shitload of room; and I seat in the Donald Draper's position (Mad Men) relaxed and taking A LOT of space.

She arrives and as soon as she get there we're all kino-ing, hugs and kisses and *finally*.  The first thing I ask her is:

* *I know you dreamed about me last night, my question to you is, how did you enjoy yourself?*

She laughs and I insist on the same line, very playful, I tell her that I dreamed about her and that I was going to be a gentlemen and not recounting everything she did in *our* dream because *I don't kiss and tell*, not even in a dream.

45 minutes go by (no timer, I look at my watch) so with this one in mind http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/came-up-with-24.jpg?w=500&amp;h=703 I whisper in her ear, while pointing to my car parked outside:

* *I am now going to go to my car, you have 2 choices: either go home, or go to the bathroom, remove your panties then join me in my car so that we can go to my place and fuck*

I got up and left, without looking behind.

In the car I was nervous, I didn't see where she had parked, nor I knew if she had time, but I figured that she had my email and phone #... I game myself ~~10~~ 15 minutes (women take longer than men, and she might have wanted to get ready) and waited.  Yes I was nervous.

After a while I see her walking towards my call all smiling.

It was a wild ride to my place and an even wilder riding of each other (no need for details).

We took a shower together, then I had to rush her back to the Starbucks since she was going to be late to her meeting.

*I'd like to be friends with you* I told her *Are you seeing anyone?*

*I am kind of seeing someone* she said *but I'd love to be friend with you*

And we made plans on going to some parties and social events in the near future, where she might even be with the guy that she's kind of seeing; and next week we'll meet at her place, and we're going to be on a once-a-week schedule going forwards.

That's what **friends** do, they exchange **benefits**

No I am not a genius, it's just that:

1. I am really not attached to outcome

2. I am always out there trying trying trying, practicing practicing practicing, and I screw up so many times.  Just yesterday I had another woman play crazy games on me... I have no idea, and here I thought that she was going to be a sure thing.  It all started because I *ignored* her for 3 days or so.

(And why you should make moves early!)",327,95,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1annbr/why_oneitis_is_a_piece_of_shit_and_getting/,"Tonight, I probably learned one of the most valuable things I could have ever learned in my life. I'm 18 and in first year of college. 

I made a post a couple days ago about how I'm not content with my life and how I thought getting a girlfriend would change that. Click on my submissions if you want to read it. But the more important thing is what I'm about to tell you guys. 

About two weeks ago, I met this girl, and we started talking. IOI's were there. She touched me when we drank together, when we walked places she'd hold onto my arm and I loved it. I really liked this girl, and I thought she was going to be my girlfriend. 

I had chances to kiss her multiple times, but I didn't, and I guess then attraction fell, and when I asked her on a date she said no. I got really caught up and I basically had one-itis. I knew I fucked up, and it's my fault that she doesn't have the feelings for me anymore, but I couldn't keep these thoughts from bothering me. For a week now, I couldn't sleep or think straight cause I kept thinking what if? 

Today, after a long day of studying for finals, I came home, tried to sleep at 2AM, but I couldn't. These thoughts keep coming, and I got super fed up. After an hour of laying in bed I couldn't stand it anymore, and I asked her to meet me in front of the library so we can talk. 

Basically I went to go get rejected, and it's probably one of the best feelings I've had in a long time. I felt liberated. I didn't give a single fuck about it anymore. If she likes me, that's awesome. If not? Move on. 

I feel 100x times better now that I know she doesn't like me anymore and on the walk home, I put on some good jams, smoked a cigarette, life was AWESOME. 

I can't express how ecstatic I am right now. 

However, for every lesson learned there is a price. Maybe she could've been an awesome girlfriend had I made my move earlier, and not been a bitch about it. But this lesson that I've learned is just as valuable.

This is **great**, but this also means there are a lot of beginners and keyboard jockeys. They post advice that isn't tested in the field, and that doesn't really apply in properly applied game. We can either be a place where newbies talk about picking up girls, or we can be a **resource** of high quality content that people can use to actually improve themselves. 

We have an amazing mod team, but things get missed. We cannot check 100% of the post constantly, sometimes posts that look fine for the first day will get invaded with bad advice the next after we've checked it.

We need **YOU**, the vigilant seddit member, to help us out with that **REPORT** button underneath comments and posts.

I want to see **at least** several dozen more reports per day! 

## WHAT does Reporting actually do?

Perhaps some members are ***scared*** of that little ""report"" button. What does it do? What actually qualifies as needing reports? Will you waste the time of a mod by reporting something incorrectly??? [OHH NOO!!!](http://jammcoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mr-bill-ohh-nooo1.jpg)

### What it does:

First, it shows up as a little yellow tag, [LIKE THIS](http://i.imgur.com/ZnDY3xT.png). As you can see, this is a comment that got a lot of downvotes and wasn't helpful.... yet it had zero reports (I reported as example)

This lets us see reports in comment threads, but it ALSO shows up in a special modqueue page, where all the reported comments / posts go. 
This means by visiting this report queue page, we can easily go through dozens of reports, just clicking on each one. 

There is very little harm in reporting a post, it takes multiple reports for anything to be automatically removed. Everything else will get moderator attention.

### When you should do it:

ThrowawayPUA (a moderator), gave good advice in the recent simple questions post:

&gt; [Members should] try to connect their comments with seduction techniques as they are known and practiced within this community.

The overall guide should be **""Does this help people effectively start sexual relationships with people they are attracted to""**. (short: ""Does this help guys meet women"") 

* Posts - Anything specific scenario should go into /r/askSeddit. Funny images, songs, youtube videos of guys being creepy / awkward are not helpful. Articles are good, in field is good, posts about techniques and mindsets are good. If you don't find value in a post, **REPORT** it.

* Comments - Seddit doesn't exist for people to make witty comments or stroke their own ego for validation. We are here to **help** people improve their social skills, specifically getting better with starting sexual relationships. If a post isn't helpful, **REPORT** it. 

* Bad Advice - If you are unsure about advice, but think it sounds questionable, even if its trying to be helpful, **REPORT** it. The Mods are highly skilled and can filter through stuff, if we ignore the reports, everything is fine, no harm done.

### What if I'm not sure???

If we notice a BUNCH of reports for things that we want to allow, I'll make another post with screenshots and examples of what we want to allow. Other than that, please do your best to help us keep this subreddit full of high quality content, by clicking that **REPORT** button.

1332609353.0,231,self.seduction,rbkbt,[LR] Shouted at a girl cycling past me. She stopped and I took her back to my place and we had some sexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,353,122,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/rbkbt/lr_shouted_at_a_girl_cycling_past_me_she_stopped/,"**the Club**

Last night I went to a club for a friend's birthday. 

While there I met a headhunter who, in his second year of the job, is earning a ludicrous amount of money (£150k+ a year). We discussed the parallels between headhunting and picking up women, which he is supposedly knowledgeable about. It turned out that there were *less* things in common than I initially expected. One major difference is headhunting is very immoral - you manipulate/lie to people on the phone / in person to giving contact details. If you are a good headhunter then people get really pissed off at you. Good seducing is very different. We exchanged business cards regardless (though mine was [this](http://pokemonmadness.tripod.com/images/kakuna.jpg) with my email scribbled on the back). I want to see his moves so drag him around and introduce him to people (who I don't know), but it didn't work out (he got genuinely put off the first 'set' that went wrong I think). Either he wasn't in state or I should be making 200k+ a year (ha)!

In the club I fell into state easily as they were playing [my music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Jv9fNPjgk). I danced with most of the dance floor and made some new friends. I wasn't sure if I felt like picking up a girl, but by the end of the night I decided I would. For reasons unknown I didn't pick up anybody (I have lots of small excuses but no real reason). The people I was with had already left so I dropped by McDonalds and got a saver menu double cheeseburger (best value for money I think).

**the Walk**

I walked to my house (40 mins away). 10 minutes away from my house a girl on a bike cycles past. Somehow I got eye contact with her and a smile. She continued cycling past and I shouted:

""Hey! Can I have a backy!?"" (A backy is when you sit on the back of somebody's bike and they do the cycling. lots of fun!).

I didn't expect her to stop her bike but she did. The tone of voice I used was a little deep but cheerful. A slightly different tone of voice and she may not have stopped. She was 15m in front of me and had stopped. I continued walking at the same pace, caught up with her, and said:

""Actually, a backy is a little too much to ask for. Lets just walk and talk for a bit^?"" (I wrote a small question mark there as it was said in such a way that it could have been a statement or a question. Perfectly in the middle. Such a small point but these are the things you start to think about when you nail the basics. Use the complexities of pronunciation and grammar to your advantage. This is maybe advanced so don't think about it if you are new - it will just throw you off or make you over-analyse stuff)

To my amazement she is really really really really really hot. She just qualified to be a teacher and so went out to celebrate with other people on her course, and is cycling back home a little drunk.

She asked who I was and what I had been up to tonight. We both are friendly towards each other and giggle. I make sure not to dip my head down to look at the floor too much, which I often do when walking long distances (bad habit). I keep some extended eye contact on her and talk in a nice slightly deeper-than-normal voice.

I asked her what makes her a good teacher, which children are worst to teach, how online learning will change teaching over the next 20 years. I looked for ways to lightly mock her or claim she was a bad teacher for jokes.

We had walked for about 1 or 2 minutes and then I ask her where she lives. She replies that she lives with her parents still, further down the road we are walking on. I tell her I live on a road nearby. By this point I'm pretty attracted to her. When I shouted at her 3 minutes prior I was only making friendly conversation / having fun, hoping to maybe have somebody to chat with while walking back. It was a triple surprise that she (1) stopped, (2) is very hot, (3) is friendly and receptive.

I ask her if she wants to have some tea (this is England, brah) and she says yes. I say ""OK my house is this way"" and she says ""Wait what you mean now?!"". She thought I meant at a later date. I say ""... Yeah."" with a slight smile. She agrees and we walk to my house. I had my arm around her for a bit. 

I tell her about how earlier this year Terrance Tao proved that all odd numbers can be made from a sum of 5 (or less) prime numbers. 

-----

**the House**

She locks her bike outside my house and then says ""I don't know what I'm doing here! I don't know you!"". I smile lightly and lean onto a wall. I need to make her comfortable before she enters the house. She is standing near me so I reach out my hand (palm facing upwards), indicating that she should hold my hand. She does and I pull her close slowly, with strong eye-eye contact. I place my other hand on her waist and pull her closer still. I say say something deep and slowly, I cant remember what. It was a question though, and she was unable to answer as her mind was too flustered with sensory overload. We knowingly smiled at that and then I placed my right hand on the back of her head and massaged it as I drew her in for a long kiss. Our lips just grazed and we breathed on each other for a bit, as that was the type of kiss the moment called for.

I took her in the house and made tea. I was a little cocky and we laughed a lot. She said she wasn't going to sleep with me and I replied ""We hardly know each other"" (not a yes or no response to her no-sex statement). Some readers will disagree with saying this as it reminds her we just met (I think its OK to say, but its such a long explanation that I wont bother).

We talked about Pinterest for a while and question how it go so big (though its not really hit the UK big time yet). I like Pinterest as its a software startup, and she liked it because all the recipes use nothing but cream cheese.

We made out in my bedroom for ages. She resisted me undressing her for 90 mins+. I didn't bother with freezing her out. Maybe I should have. Instead of freezing her out I pinpointed what made her extremely aroused (should I call this ""pinteresting""?). What tipped her over the edge was making her imagine my cock was inside her while she was grinding on me. Talking dirty was a weakness that I've been working on lately. Requires a lot of confidence the first time you do it on somebody new.  http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/d4tz6/dirty_talk_101_talking_dirty_to_a_girl/

1367141664.0,231,self.seduction,1d9k1q,[FR] F-Closed 2 set (cold approach),298,67,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1d9k1q/fr_fclosed_2_set_cold_approach/,"I don't see a lot of FR's that go from cold approach to f-close (perhaps because most sedditors aren't cold approaching?), so I thought I'd share one of mine. 

The scene:
Out at a bar that was having a theme night with my room mate/wing. I'm at the bar when I spot a two set (HB6.5 HB7) immediately to my left. I hesitate for about six seconds, then open indirect 'Hey, can I get a female opinion on something?' ... HB6.5 is standing closest, she lights up and immediately says 'sure!' I can tell she's attracted, HB7 seems unsure, but HB6.5 appears to be the dominant of the two so I'm pretty sure it's going to be easy to get to the hook point.

'So, my friend who just disappeared that way' (I gesture in the general direction I think my wing went), 'is going on a first date next week. He told her he'd surprise her but doesn't know where he's going to take her. I think he should &lt;date idea&gt;... What do you think?' 

We talk about first dates, right as I'm about to switch off the opener, my wing walks up (perfect timing, just lucky). Hey! (I put my arm around my wing). This is the guy who's going on the first date. Now the girls seem even more engaged (the power of a rooting your opener)!  

The four of us stand around and chat for another few minutes, while my wing is talking to HB6.5 I switch to HB7 and begin talking with her 1 on 1. I have a rule when making conversation where I don't ask questions, but instead make assumptions. 'You obviously aren't from &lt;city we're in&gt;, because &lt;observation about her&gt;.' I find this makes for a more fun conversation than asking 'where are you from?' even when an assumption is wrong, she'll laugh and tell me I'm wrong and we can talk about why I made the assumption. Plus sometimes I'm right. I didn't guess accurately in this case (but it didn't matter).

For the next 30 minutes I talk to HB7, my wing and HB6.5 drift apart, HB6.5 comes back to check on HB7 periodically, but isn't trying to get in the way.

As we talk I steadily kino escalate (standard escalation ladder), starting at light touches on her arm until after about 30 minutes it got to the point where an observer would think we're a couple based on how I was touching her (think about how you touch a girl you're already dating, this is what I was doing). During this process I casually number close her. We have a moment where our faces are close, I triangle gaze and say 'I'm trying so hard not to kiss you right now.' she smiles, I go for the kiss, she's very receptive (note: at this point it was clear to me she would kiss based on the kino escalation up to this point, kissing did not feel like making a leap, the beauty of smooth kino escalation).

A bit later my wing comes over and quietly suggests we location change (smart!). 

Next time the four of us are standing together I bring up a really cool bar in the neighborhood I live in, the girls say they've never been there. I say let's go right now, we hail a cab and the four of us ride to the bar (I lead the location change because I opened the set).

At the new bar I'm just having fun with it, making out with HB7 by the bar in the middle of the crowd because why not. After we get drinks I lead us to a table, we sit down. During this time my wing k-closes HB6.5. Lights flash for last call. I say something like 'We live close by, let's go smoke [weed], our place is nearby'. From earlier conversation I knew the girls smoked. My wing and I have gotten many a 2 sets back to our place to smoke weed, I think it serves the same function as 'I've got a great bottle of wine', though our success rate has been very high (of the last 4 two sets we've said this to, 3 came back to our place).

As we are about to get in the cab HB6.5 starts piping up like they should bail. I maintain a strong frame and continue going through the motions of piling into the cab, telling the cabby to go to our place. I don't try to convince her of anything, I just continue acting as if 'of course we're going back to our place'.  Momentum carries us through and we're back at our flat smoking weed.

After about 10 minutes I look over and my roommate has disappeared (he later told me he said to HB6.5 'I want to show you something', and took her to his room). I grab HB7 by the hand and lead her to my room (no words exchanged).

You can fill in the blank for what happened next.

1354283401.0,232,self.seduction,141uky,A little something I use on female friends and ex's. Might work for you. ,378,146,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/141uky/a_little_something_i_use_on_female_friends_and/,"I learned this from a friend who is pretty much a natural. I didn't think this up myself. 

I started it on my ex, I've never thought about getting back together with an ex or having casual sex but now these options have become a reality. 

A few weeks after we broke up I was over her house clearing up my stuff and I fell asleep on her couch. When she woke me up to take me home I basically channelled McNulty and said 'how about a fuck for the road?'. We didn't fuck, but instead of going berserk she started giggling like 'oh shut up'. 

I kept this going and noticed how much she enjoyed it. Not relentlessly but if I saw a funny way to bring up having sex I would. And its so fun to do it. 

I started doing it lately with our female friends in my circle. Normally it's very unsexual but after a few weeks they 'get it' and it leads to some funny interactions. 

Now my ex calls all the time and we have a good relationship. I know I'm still on her mind whereas before past relationships delved into bitterness. The females in my group may not be seduced per se but they definitely look at me as sexual now and that sort of image of 'if I am alone in a room with him I will sex him'. 

It's really good for my confidence and keeps you in the zone which I love being in. 

The key things: never overdo it, always mix it with humour but make it known it would happen. 

Some examples of things I've said:
-have you ever had your back door smashed in? You wanna?
-if any girl moans about bad sex I say 'you ain't met thumper yet have you? And look at my cock. 
-if we hug I do so many things, VERY obviously going for a kiss so she reels back, whisper something silly in her ear seductively(off topic but breathy whispers in a girls ear can sometimes be enough)
-if we saw a girl in underwear I would say things like 'oh you would look hot in THAT' or 'she looks like you' while looking her up and down. 

I hope people realise by now this isn't for any sort of relationship. It shows you as someone who doesn't take sex all that seriously and for a girl looking for meaningless sex your top of the list. 

All the girls I do this to love it. I think they enjoy it for what it is but also because they feel good about themselves. But never be rude or threatening, it's all suggestive. 

Like, 'so when are we having sex' instead of 'I'm going to fuck you'. 

Hope this helps someone at least.

What I did before:

* Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
* Sit on my couch and get high and play video games or watch movies.
* Complain, bitch, moan, whine, and complain some more (about work, why I couldn't meet a nice girl &lt;-- duh idiot you're sitting alone at home, about anything and everything that I thought didn't seem fair).
* Hang out at my friends house... getting high and doing nothing.


What I do regularly NOW:

* Work out (running and lifting)
* Climbing (indoor, mostly bouldering)
* Yoga
* Meditation
* Improv classes (highly recommend these)
* Fun runs in my city
* Hiking


Things I tried that didn't stick:  

* Fencing lessons
* Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
* Floatation / Isolation tank (medtation, healing, relaxing - I really need to start doing this regularly)
* Dance lessons (couldn't get the scheduling to work right, will try again)


Things I still want to try:

* Cooking class
* American Sign Language class (maybe other languages)
* Art lessons (painting, drawing, etc.)
* Dozens of classes 
* More volunteering



Try new things, just make sure you're doing these things for you.  
I work out because it makes me feel good, though there are certainly other benefits.

There's no harm in **TRYING** something, and more often than not, it's a minimum time and cost commitment.  
When I tried fencing, classes were once a week for 6 weeks, all gear included, for $95 - how could I *NOT* give it a go?

Look up things you want to do, and make a list.  
If 30 days later you're still really interested in doing the activity **GO DO IT!**  
At the very least you'll get to experience some new things, hopefully get some good stories out of it, and that alone makes you **more interesting**.

Ok. So, I had 2 call ins. I went out with a girl from a few weeks ago for our 2nd meet up (f-closed already). I went to a bar where I know the bartenders, and they hooked us up. Everything was standard game (teasing, DHV from being known in the bar, kino) until I upped the ante.

""Listen, I have to be back in a little over an hour, and right now I have an erection and I'm thinking about the last time we fucked. You need to figure out how to fix this situation."" 

She blushed, laughed, and said she would think about it while she went to the bathroom. We drove into the neighborhood then fucked in her car, she dropped me off where I had to be, and I felt like going out, so I called in another 1.

We went back to the same bar. (I don't hide anything about my lifestyle. Me bringing 2 girls into the bar back to back in the same night and having them both be into me will give me a reputation for a long time). The bartender I know had just gotten off and invited us to the next bar, we finished our drinks, then went to the next bar, then had a drink and bounced again.

We walk into another bar, and half the faces turned and stared at my girl. She's a HB8, with a stunning face, easily a 9 face and dresses well. It took me one second to realize I'd have guys coming onto her, as one other AFC tried earlier, and I laughed and destroyed his value to her. 

""Aww, he has a crush on you. What's it like to finally have a guy like you? This is a new feeling for you isn't it?""

Also, you know what games they're going to try, call that shit out 

""Watch, he's going to try to touch the small of your back and pass a backhanded insult on me."" 

Like I was fucking Miss cleo, he tried. My girl just started laughing at the situation and I gave her a knowing look. He was on the outside of our joke. Create that distance.

So backtothegame in his magnum opus field report talks about knowing the furniture in the room, and how to make sure it is Kino-Inducing. This has by far been the most important aspect of my successful dates recently. So right now, there's a huge U shaped bar in front of me, with 80% dudes, all staring at my girl. I take her to the far end of the U (top right portion) and sit her on the outside, and side inside of her, with a 2 set (with their respective guys) sitting to the inside of me. I diffused her looks with 2 pretty girls. and also set it up so she was on the outside.

From there we are chatting and everything is going great, she is laughing her ass off, and the AFC from earlier appears and he is trying to DHV. ""I play guitar, look at my tattoos."" I just kind of smiled and let him try, he had failed within the first minute, and I destroyed his value, he's no threat now, so I back off and open the girls to the left of me.

""Hey, I saw you guys in the last bar, you had some guys all up on you. They wanted that, what'd you do to chase them away?""

""Oh my god, they literally walked up to us and ... blah blah blah"" 

She was kinoing me to show what the guys were doing, so I brought my date into the conversation with her. To push AFC further out of our circle without him knowing. This girl is INTO me instantly, and when I bring my date in

""Oh my god, you have the prettiest face.""

Then after a bit, new girl goes.

""So what are you two? are you together?""

Me - ""Well, it's more of a fleetwood mac situation.""

She laughs and says that's her favorite band, and goes

""Hey, Date, can you look up the name of that song for me?""

My date pulls out her phone and looks it up, and the girl grabs me by the side and sticks her tongue in my ear and gives me that breathy exhale. Keep in mind, she has her hand on my thigh the entire time, and my girl does on the other thigh. 

My date finds the song and tells us, I take her phone and type ""This girl just tongue fucked my ear ;)"" in it. 

She goes ""I don't believe you"" but notices that she had her hand on my thigh. 

I go to the bathroom, and apparently the entire conversation was this girl asking my date if she could go out with me and if it was cool. 

So I come back and my date had moved closer to the girl. closing off my spot. I get inbetween the two and push my date further to the outside. Remember, you're the center of attention, act like it.

So I open the other girl in the 2 set, the hotter one (hb7) and I see she has tattoos. I shake her hand and hold it. When you see tattoos, you can always open them like this.

Staring.
""How old is this tattoo?""
""yadda yadda.""
""It has aged really well, you didn't get it around here did you?""(if it's a good tattoo, they didn't get it in D.C., we have terrible artists.)

I was right and really into it, so I decided to spit some at her.

""Alright, what's your game, I've seen these guys on you all night, show me your A game. Pretend I'm a less handsome guy sitting at the bar. Hit on me.""

BOOM. She started kinoing me, and had her hands all over me and I was kinoing her back, complimenting certain parts and telling her how to open better. I told her I was surprised she wasn't still a virgin. We all laughed. I would have pulled the number if it wasn't RIGHT in front of my girl. 

Anyways, they end up leaving and we finish up and AFC is waiting outside the bar and says something to my girl trying to get her to stop. I wink at her and just walk away.

I didn't slow my pace, but ignored her, she also knew I wouldn't wait for her. By my calculations she probably had 10 seconds before she said goodbye and ran down the sidewalk to catch up with me. 

It was a beautiful night, and I was sober to drive so I took her out, and we went to a place near my house and fucked like crazy before I dropped her off at home then went home.

**Takeaways**

* Don't hide your reputation, encourage it, success brings success.

* Don't be afraid to ask a bartender you like for their number, just in a platonic way. I always text this girl when I go out ""Hey are you working?"" If she is, I bring girls, she's also bubbly, and I tip her well, and she hooks me up. My number pull was literally ""Hey, I go out a lot and you're a pretty fucking boss bartender, give me your phone number so I can find out if you're working on those nights."" Go to them a few times before you do this, but it will DHV every one you bring in. 

* I live at home. I had some family issues yesterday, and wasn't able to bring a girl home. Did it hold me back? Fuck no. Maybe it would in certain situations, but I fucked 2 girls in public instead of going to their houses or mine. Own it.

* a great way to flip the tides and turn a platonic thing into a sexually charged way is to tell them to spit game at you. then critique it. When it comes to your turn? There was a line Usher did on the tyra banks show. She goes ""How do you talk to a girl?"" and was heavily pushing for them to qualify, the first younger rapper did some bullshit qualification. Tyra presses usher, and Usher gets her to say something and cuts her off with a ""SHUT UP."" It was well delivered and hilarious, and reframed everything. I did this when it was my ""Game"" turn. Don't qualify.

1322437989.0,231,self.seduction,mrc05,The results of my social experiment (What girls seem to find attractive),338,107,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mrc05/the_results_of_my_social_experiment_what_girls/,"Okay, so I have always been interested in people, people watching and why people act a certain way. (And what happens when they do) I have been conducting an experiment for about a year and want to share my 'findings' with the cool people of Reddit.

I am a long time user of Reddit, I created this throwaway just for this.

Before we get started, I just want to state up front to avoid downvote's that:

1) I am in no way endorsing acting like something you are not or behaving in a particular way. I am also not saying that a particular way is 'right'. I am just sharing my findings with you.

2) I am not an expert at picking up girls, this is just my findings.

3) You may already know this, think this is common knowledge, but I am sure some wont, which is why I created this post.

So, now we have dealt with the formalities..

For the past year I have been switching between two different 'personalities' for want of a better phrase. Please no obvious jokes about split personality, I get that enough from the voices I hear ;-)

For one, I dress smart casual, in jeans, nice shirt, keeps himself tidy and acts confident and friendly but respectful.

Kind of like a young professional.

For the other, I leave shaving so I have stubble, wear a baseball cap (Backwards most of the time) and wear more hip hop style clothes.

When I dress like that I act more nonchalant and usually keep my chin up a little, act shorter with people and keep to myself more.

I guess one makes me look like a professional guy, the other makes me look like a bad boy.

What I have found (which, like I said, many of you may say you already know, but for me, this confirms it) is that I get SO much more attention from girls when I am dressed like a 'bad boy'.

Also, (and slightly worryingly) I get a LOT more attention from younger girls too. Younger teenage girls who usually wont pay much attention suddenly check me out, giggle and even approach me with their numbers sometimes. (In the past year I would say I have had about 6 girls approach me and give me their number, every time bar one, its when I was dressed more like a 'bad boy') 

I am in my late twenties, so pushing thirty, and whilst it is an ego boost, I actually get a little scared thinking of the younger girls acting that way towards me. One girl who wrote her number on a napkin and got her friend to give it to me was actually 16. (I asked her friend how old she was) Obviously I threw the number away (not in front of her) and politely told her friend I was too old for her but to thank her anyway.

It literally is scary to me how younger girls seem to seek out my approval and attention and give me looks when I dress more like a 'bad boy'.

A lot of this will seem very obvious. We all know the 'girls go for bad boys' phrase, and we know, younger teenage girls are more likely to be rebellious and also go for guys a little older than them, but when you experience it first hand with such a marked difference, its very interesting to see.

Saying that, I do find that women of all age groups give me more attention when dressed in a more 'bad boy' style. Even older women give me more attention.

The other day at a restaurant a women who was having dinner with who I would assume was her husband kept glancing over at me and smiled twice. At one point when I went to use the restroom, as I came out she was coming in and she smiled at me and said hi. I looked back after I walked off out of curiosity and she was standing looking back at me smiling in a very inviting manner making it obvious she was looking at me.

I do find, when dressed smarter and more respectfully (I dont dress 'old' or boring office style when dressed like this, I actually dress pretty trendily with nice shirts and jeans and cool shoes or sneakers and always take care of my appearance) that I still get looks but it seems women tend to be less obvious about it and I definitely find less younger women taking notice.

Just to clarify, so I dont sound like a total nutcase, I actually dress in both styles kind of naturally anyway.. I like to dress smart but sometimes I will dress 'down' and wear caps etc and I guess I look a little more like I am wearing hip hop style clothes when I do that. (Please no judgement on what I wear) I noticed a marked difference naturally and decided to deliberately play it up and exaggerate the difference and see what the results are as human behavior has always interested me.

The funny thing is, I have even had one girl who works in a coffee shop I go to, very obviously check me out and flirt with me when I wear 'bad boy' style clothes and when I have gone in there dressed smartly, she has almost ignored me.. Then going back in again dressed in the casual stuff, she carried on flirting obviously with me.

Just as a final point, whilst I do exaggerate it, its not like I am wearing disguises. It is always obviously me and there is nothing massively outrageous about either style of clothing I wear.

So, it seems, from the 'experiment' I have been running, girls give me WAY more attention and would be much more open to being approached or picked up by a guy if they have a classic bad boy look about them.

Whilst we all knew this was said to be true, I find it very surprising that this is actually the case in real life, especially with the older married women who seem to check me out even when with their husbands sometimes and do so blatantly. 

Final note, I say none of this to boast, I am sure for every girl who does check me out or approach me, there are 100 girls who would never be interested in me. I don't change my confidence level or the way I do things or approach situations when dressed in either style, so it pretty much comes down to how I am presenting myself.

Anyway, thought you guys might like to know and that it may spark an interesting conversation.

(Bracing myself and slightly worried about downvotes but hope you found something interesting out of this pretty long post)


TL;DR - I dress in two very different styles at different times. Young professional smart, and hip hop style bad boy. When dressed with the 'bad boy' style I am very surprised how much MORE attention I get from girls and how they approach me.

1348492872.0,225,self.seduction,10e2qu,"[FR] Epic Night - ""Screw it, zero fucks given""",303,78,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/10e2qu/fr_epic_night_screw_it_zero_fucks_given/,"Alright, a bit about me before my report.  I've been a long time lurker and have thoroughly observed different PUA methods and approaches. They have helped me a little bit but I have found my own method that seemed to have worked.  I wouldn't even call it a method, its really just a situation of go for it and have a good time.  this obviously will only really work in certain situations. I am a 24 year-old fat guy (312 lbs, lost 28 so far, well on my way to my weight loss goal). That being said, I've always been very insecure and self conscious.  I still have my V-Card and it has bothered me until these past 3 months that I have been going out.  Anyways, I've always enjoyed the club scene as I am a huge fan of EDM.  Not the best location for approaching the ladies but I figured it would be a good place to start - giving me a good challenge.  I have been a frequent patron of this club and the staff all know me because initially I was ""That Guy"" that hung out in the corner watching. They worked on getting me out of my shell and I became more open. Yes, I was a creeper all due to my awkwardness and social retardation at the beginning.  I had opened up a bit but I still had approach anxiety and was still very self conscious. Hell, I was still awkward with hugs to be honest, due to my extreme lack of experience and physical interaction with women.  I had danced with a few girls that would drag me onto the dance floor but that was it.

Now we move to this past Saturday night.  There were ladies everywhere. Don't know what was special about this night but there were countless more an usual.  I approached 2 that I found attractive and seemed cool, only to find out they were with their boyfriends.  No biggie, brushed it off (rejection used to always haunt me). After observing, everyone else was in a group and I figured the night was over as far as chances are concerned.  Music was blaring, and I figured well, I might as well enjoy myself while I'm here.  I began to dance to the music, by myself.  Now whenever I had danced before it wasn't much. It was fun but I always felt awkward and self conscious.  Well, this past Saturday night I decided, I don't give a fuck.  I came to the realization that I am here to have a good time and if anyone else stares, laughs at my horrible moves, whatever - that's their deal.  I started going at it, moved onto the middle of the dance floor.  After the first song or two, I began to notice I was drawing attention to myself. Soon enough, after another minute or so, everyone on the floor had noticed me and started dancing with me.  The ladies were all over me.  I had never ""grinded"" until that point, was interesting to say the least.  Guys were cheering me on, it was insane.  The DJ knew me and I got a couple shout outs over the speaker system which fueled the whole situation.  Did I mention I can't dance at all?   I was just jamming to the music.  Now picture this fat guy that is sweating his ass off, out of breath, having a blast.  I can honestly say it was the best time of my life.

Out of this experience, before leaving the club, I received 3 numbers from extremely attractive  girls who I never would have dreamed of approaching to begin with - who wanted to go out sometime to grab a drink or hang out.  I was invited to 4 different after parties (was only able to attend 2 unfortunately).  At the first party I was able to obtain 2 more numbers. I didn't use any approach methods - just had a good time dancing to the music with people and I was the one being approached.  At the second after party, I had my first kiss with a girl.  Yes, cheesy but I had never kissed anyone before.  She was an 8 - gorgeous brunette.  Final count: 5 phone numbers and 1 kiss.

So, after that novel - the moral of the story...  What worked for me in the end was not giving a single fuck about anything and just diving right in to do what I enjoyed.  That openness and cavalier mentality got me attention that I never imagined.  I know this will not help everyone but I hope it at least help those who are in a similar situation I started in (having difficulty getting out there and just ""doing""). If you are worried about rejection, understand that it's going to happen, why not get started now and work on your methods.  If you are self conscious about doing something that you enjoy - understand that everyone in that venue is there to have a good time.  Nobody cares what you do or how you do it.  As long as you enjoy yourself and meet your ultimate goals, go for it.

TL;DR - Fat guy here, initially very awkward and self conscious, decided to go for broke and ended up getting numbers and a kiss without even trying and having a good time.



Edit - Response to All:
I did not expect anywhere close to this kind of response.  You have no idea how much I appreciate the input from everyone.  Saturday night changed my entire perspective on everything social in nature, not just PUA.  I had been told a couple of times prior to by people that noticed me sheepishly hanging out in the corner or at the end of the bar doing nothing but standing there with my drink and ever so slightly getting my groove on to the awesome music - ""Get out there and have fun, that's what we're all here for"".  I listened but it never actually clicked because I was stubborn.  It has given me a level of confidence I don't think I would have had for months if none of this happened.  I have received responses from 3 of the 5 females whom gave me their numbers.  I met one today for coffee, nothing more than getting to know one another - was a good time.  Have an outing planned with the second later this week and the final wants to meet up for dinner with her group of friends this coming Saturday night prior to attending the same club.  I have transformed from a socially awkward guy who cringed at the thought of being rejected and too scared to make a move to I don't even know what...  All I know is, it's awesome and the feeling is absolutely incredible.

I hope this was inspiring and helpful to those who had a similar situation.

I've learned a lot from Seddit these last few months, and made significant progress in my transition from AFC. Two weeks ago, I was riding high, having gone from rarely getting laid to having two steady fwb and other one-nighters and dates on the side (all while being completely honest with all involved, I might add).

But now I have a problem that has fucked up my game and forced me to withdraw. One of the women I slept with had genital herpes, and now I have it too. She told me about it beforehand but said she hadn't had an outbreak in a while, and we used protection, so I figured I'd be alright.

Well, now I have symptoms and I don't quite know where to go from here. According to CDC statistics one in five adults have it, and frankly I don't think it's a huge deal, but it's compromised my confidence and I'm dreading the thought of having to bring it up with new women before I sleep with them.

Since so many adults have it, I'm sure some PUA's here have to deal with this, so I'm wondering how you approach it. Or even if you have other STD's or have had partners who do, I'd be curious to know how it's affected your game and how you've dealt with the ramifications.

EDIT: I've gotten some good insight from the discussion so far but it's time for bed. I'm hoping someone else who is experienced in this specific situation will still chime in, but regardless I'll try to answer all constructive comments / questions in the morning.

One night we got a bottle of whisky and sat on the balcony joking and chatting while getting pissed. He was a good looking lad, with a great sense of humour and he was a good conversationalist. I got the impression that he didn't have too much trouble attracting women, but as the night progress and the whisky started loosening our tongues he started telling me of his relationship problems. He tried incredibly hard to make the relationships work, but the chemistry always fizzled out. 

He started describing all the nice stuff he did for his girlfriends and it became obvious to me that he had a major case of putting the pussy on the pedestal. He even proudly told me that he treated his girlfriends ""like goddesses"", at which I flinched a little. He seemed genuinely confused as to why his relationships didn't work out. I was pretty drunk by this point and just let the guy talk it out, but when he finally ran out of steam I simply said...


""If you treat a woman like she's better than you, she'll end up thinking that she's better than you"".


To me this was just a simple observation of cause and effect, nothing particularly deep, but the effect on this guy was amazing. He looked so shocked that I thought maybe I'd said something to offend him.  After a few seconds of frozen immobility he let out a long, quiet ""Fuuuuuck"" and I could see that the coin had dropped. He'd been struggling to work out where he'd been going wrong all this time and that simple sentence made everything click.


While he was having his moment of realisation I was having one of my own. There was a time in my youth when I'd been just as lost as this kid was and this information would have been incredibly valuable to me, but I kind of take it for granted as basic common sense now. It's easy to forget how valuable this knowledge is and how far I've come thanks to this community.


Thanks everyone. :)

1367847533.0,229,self.seduction,1dshp5,A quick guide to clubbing,355,126,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1dshp5/a_quick_guide_to_clubbing/,"**Can't stress this enough, this is written from a Melbourne perspective! Make sure you adhere to your city's rules or culture!**

I've been reading that a lot of people hate clubbing and I think it's because they're not doing it right. Well, here's a quick guide I whipped up. 

Clubbing isn't for everyone. It's full of the most superficial people on the planet. Fortunately, those brave enough to venture into clubs will be greeted with the easiest pick up of all time. As a resident of Melbourne, the #3 clubbing city in the world (according to my mate), clubbing was literally my only option to meet young people (18-21). Bars are full of an older crowd, so I was thrust into the world of going out every night (except Wednesday). 

As stated previously, clubs are full of the most incredibly superficial girls imaginable. You will not pick up if you don't look good. This does not mean you should give up if you have a sub par face (I have a 4-5/10 face at best) but it does mean you need to get a gym membership, get good fitting clothes and smell amazing (important!). I was incredibly frustrated with clubbing as a skinny 18 year old nerd, but fixing the aesthetic side of things made it *a lot* easier. Don't lift, buy nice clothes and smell nice ""just for club girls"", do it for yourself. Looking good and feeling good are important parts of life in general, but unfortunately looking good is the defining factor in clubs. 

So, you look good, smell nice and are ready to destroy the d floor. But which club? One with your age group and your taste in music. In Melbourne on any given night there are about 30 or 40 different clubs open with a unique crowd and music. There's the hipster one, the asian one, the wog (im wog so I can say it ok!) and the list goes on. Most of them are open on different nights and have a different age group as well. I know for a fact that one club has 18-21 year olds on Thursday and 28+ on Saturdays. Choose wisely, because if you go to an 18 year old one and you're 26 you look like a flog, and if you're 18 going with an older crowd you look like a cute kid.

Who are you gonna go with though? You've found your club but you need your mates! The best nights I've had were with 2 of my best friends. The more people you have the worse it gets, you tend to all group up and dance together and it gets boring fast. Girls are great to go with, but it's the same principal - they want to dance with you and you can't really let them be alone. Maybe if you have 2 or 3 girls you can leave them in their own little group but eh. When you're with your 2-3 mates though it becomes easy because you don't care. 

So you've found a club with a great line up, dirty bangers and your type of crowd. You walk in and don't know what to do. This bit's easy - just have fun. Buy a few drinks with your mates and dance. Get j00cy and fist pump to the bangers. You don't need to know how to dance, as long as you move your hips and move your arms around (bonus points for having nice big juicy arms). But what's that in the distance? You spot this qt in a red dress. What do you do? Walk up to her, maintain eye contact but sexy smile and make sure you give off a fun vibe. Grab her hips or hands or w/e, gauge her interest, go in close (this is why smell is important) and say literally anything (""what's your name?"" ""you look good, but can you dance?"" shit like that). If she's keen she'll wrap her arms around your neck. If she isn't, do it for her. If she resists, smile and walk away. If you don't really like interaction for whatever reason, it is sort of ok to randomly grind with a girl from behind. 'Play grinding' is good as well, just grab her hips and if she grabs your hands you're golden otherwise don't bother. Ask her name or whatever in her ear, spin her around and kiss her. 

Hard bit is the group of girls or the one with the fat friend. Groups of girls obviously are harder and since you can't talk to all of them at once you can't win them over with your charm. What I like to do is get my mates involved. Each take a girl and it becomes 1v1. There might be a few girls left over but that's ok, as long as the majority are taken. If you're solo or your friend is otherwise occupied, just start dancing with one girl as if she was on her own. Issue here is that her friends will give her the nod of approval or the headshake of dismay. If you make the girl laugh and have a good time then you'll be set. The fat friend is a lot more difficult, your friend has to take one for the team. Also, it gives you a joke to tell your girl (but be careful) **you joke about your wingman not her** I can't reiterate how important it is to keep the fat friend under control. Last Thursday I was dancing/making out with a girl and as I was about whip out my phone the fat friend literally drags her away and yells ""I'M GOING HOME OK YOU COMING?"" Last I saw of my club princess ;__;

Now you're dancing with her and making out. It's going great - stop her and ask for her number. If it's late, perhaps you may want to go back to her or your place or if it's early and you're feeling cheeky have a quicky in the bathroom. Either way, get the number if you're interested. Otherwise, just make up some excuse and pray she's not clingy (""My mates are going, see ya"" ""Oh shit, just got a text my mate fell in the toilet brb""). Sometimes she may not give you her number. That's fine, all she was looking for was a cheap club hook up. But if she felt something SPECIAL then she'll give it to you. 

Final tip: If you're a manlet like me, don't bother dancing with taller girls. You'll look ridiculous. 

And that's pretty much a typical night walk-through. It really is easy, most of the girls are looking for a hook up. If you look good, dress well, smell nice and have an aura of confidence about you clubbing becomes almost too easy. 

Cheers lads

1332524804.0,226,self.seduction,ra8ym,My simple strategy for CONFIDENCE.,281,55,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ra8ym/my_simple_strategy_for_confidence/,"The #1 rule in meeting women is to stop giving a shit.

When you worry too much and question every detail, you will place yourself in a whirlwind of trouble. Women can sense if you are too inside your head. So what’s the best way to stop? Follow these steps closely:

•Act. 

•Learn. 

•Move on.

**Act** – Set out what you intend to do, whether it is approaching, flirting, getting her number, or getting a date.

**Learn** – Did you succeed? Did you fail? Whatever the outcome, take note on what you did right or wrong and understand why.

**Move on** – Take what you learned and apply it to the next situation.

That’s it.

When you’re trying to learn a new skill, you have to set aside as much negative and disruptive thinking as possible. It will hinder your success and in this case, be unattractive to the women you are approaching. Women want to know that they have a man that has it “all figured out”. They can sense something is off when you are too inside your head. So get out! Stay on the directed path of “Act, Learn, Move on.” Don’t think about anything else and when you do, remember to get back on track.

**Don’t be outcome dependent.**

In the beginning, it’s not about the outcome as much as it about the path to getting there. If you care too much about the outcome, then you will miss all the great things that can be learned. It’s baby steps. It’s one inch at a time, until you get to where you want to be. In fact, the outcome should never be reached. You should be always pushing yourself further and further every step of the way. 

If you embody all these ideas, then confidence will soar through you. The one that has the most confidence is the one with not a care in the world. He knows what he needs to do and he knows how to do it. 

He acts. He learns. He moves on.

**TL;DR: Stop giving a shit about the outcome and live in the moment**

I had every justification of why I couldn't approach a girl. I made excuses as to why I couldn't approach girls to satisfy my ego. Back in my day, we didn't have things like /r/seduction to learn us. We had crappy ""free"" sights that were created by other guys who couldn't get laid but were looking to make money off it. I always fell into relationships but none were of any value. When I wasn't in a relationship I convinced myself I was focused on my career. I had had minimal luck in approaching girls that I wasn't sure were a lock. In the meantime, I've obtained a great career, I own my own home, I have an interesting life (long motorcycle trips, rock climbing, active reader, interesting stories, etc) but still can't get over approaching a girl.

My last relationship ended over a year ago. I had some unsuccessful dates from online dating but nothing from spontaneously meeting people in public. A few months ago I had met a friend of a female friend. Instantly thought she was cute but found out she was in a relationship. For some reason, I later got the impression that it wasn't serious. Fast forward to tonight, she meets me and my friend out for drinks. We get to talking and agree to go smoke a j in the parking lot (another bonus, I finally found a great MJ connection.) We're having a great conversation and I finally go for it. I tell her I think she's really cute and I want to kiss her. Complete rejection follows. She tell's me she has a semi-serious boyfriend, she's flattered, she thinks I'm intelligent (WTF? You're not my employer, at least tell me I'm cute).

**And if felt great to be rejected.** I would have preferred a little make out session but 2nd place sufficed. We hung out for another 10-15 minutes outside. Very little awkwardness. We walked back inside. She told me she thought everyone was going to think we were having sex. I told her that that was my story and then told her I was going to reverse our roles when I told our friends about what happened. We hung out at the bar some more and had some laughs. No real awkwardness at all. I finally left when I got bored but got a tight squeeze on my way out. Boyfriend or not, I'm convinced something more may come out of it in the future.

If you're in your late teens and early 20s and freaking out about talking to women, enjoy it. It's expected. Be awkward. If you're in college and can't approach a girl, it will only get worse when you get out of college. You will never have as many women in your age range in such close proximity again in your life.

1342157080.0,224,self.seduction,whhao,Want to get better at banter and the alpha attitude? Watch Archer. Seriously. ,303,79,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/whhao/want_to_get_better_at_banter_and_the_alpha/,"This is coming from a comment I just read on here from a guy who wanted to know how to get better at bantering and stop having dry humorless conversations. A common malaise of the logically-inclined. 

Yesterday I was at my friend's place, and turned on Comedy Central. Guess what was on? Yep, [Archer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_(TV_series\)). It was the episode where they have to save a remote installation in some swampy part of Florida from an eco-terrrist. 

Now, my friend had never heard of it, so after we got over the initial shock of what was going on, we thoroughly enjoyed it. But the best part? The banter between Archer and the girl sidekick. Archer is the consummate Alpha and it shows. He can do no wrong in his own eyes, and even when their boat is sinking and they have a gator circling around them, he is chill and irrationally self-confident. That's the attitude you want to learn. That's the attitude that you want to be able to pull off with a hot girl, so she'll be wondering whether you are really all that, and guess what - the only way she can find out is by having your cock train go steaming up her love tunnel. Choo choo motherfucker. 

Backing up a bit, Roosh recommends always watching an episode of Seinfeld to pump yourself up and get in a funny, social mood before going on a night out. It works great, not only because it makes you laugh and takes your mind off of the social anxiety of going out to pick up, but because you'll be able to recall some funny lines from the show and spit them out when the moment demands it. 

I'd say that if you feel you're not that good at banter and coming up with funny shit on the spur of the moment, you need to watch Archer and learn from the way he talks. If anyone has links to where one can watch Archer, be sure to post them up. Torrents use way too much bandwidth for me.

Yesterday, I was sat just talking to a random old woman about where she'd been/where she was going at the bus/trainstation. I was killing time because like a moron i'd missed by bus and had over an hour to wait. I took seddits advice and just started talking to people randomly to gain confidence in speaking to people and as I was telling this woman that I was a mature student, that I'd decided to change my entire career path and life course, we got chatting just about anything. We shot the shit and eventually her bus arrived and she departed. 

Exactly ten seconds later, a rather cute girl came and sat next to me and said, this is a quote; ""You sound interesting, I would've come and sat here sooner but I didn’t want to move the old woman"". From this we got talking about her travels and places she'd like to go, conversation was pleasant, fluid and filled with laughs. After about 45 minutes of this, she said she had to go although she really wished she had more time. I was feeling confident and smiling with a sense of purpose I took out my phone and told her to put her number in it, she obliged and then rang herself to get my number.

While it's unlikely this will actually go anywhere, it was my first #-close seddit. I actually did it. The guy who six months ago was considering therapy due to his inability to have contact with the opposite sex. And if anything, this whole experience has taught me that by having confidence all the time, the unexpected might happen. It’s a state of mind at all times, not just when you're on a night out.

**TL;DR Have your gameface on all the time.**

**EDIT:** Wow! I can't put into words the level of gratitude I have for all the brofists, words of encouragement and ideas for a next step. Its simply astonishing. Something I forgot to mention in my initial post is that she is, in fact, a tourist from down-under who has gone to London for the remainder of her trip. Although from the flurry of texts, I suspect she may try to get one more trip back up north. I'll walk with it and see where the whole thing leads me. Thanks seddit.

from whiners who have given up please)",302,76,180,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/uspu1/47yearold_male_virgin_looking_for_pointers_no/,"How I got in this fix is complicated. I wish it was as simple as the 40-year-old Virgin movie scenario, but it's a combination of a lot of things - shyness, some bad shit that happened a long time ago, problems with depression, living in hick towns for too many years.

But anyway, here I am, and I am determined to fight my way out and I think I can do it. I'm like a teenager just starting out though and I need some advice. I've already found some good advice here and on a PUA type blog and taken it to heart. 

I would like to hear from any guys who were older virgins who were able to beat their curse and start having a normal dating life. How did you do it? 

Like I said, no self-pitying type posts from guys who have already thrown in the towel. 

Some things I've done recently to get myself on track: 

1. Deleted porn and trying to go 7 days at a time without spanking it. This has already helped noticeably by making me more open to dating women closer to my age (just finished an episode of pursuing a 20-something woman that was never going to pan out, wasting a bunch of time). All that porn was training me to want things I'm not likely to get, at least not at first. I""m also curious to see if the testosterone cycle is really a thing.

3. Called the cable company and got my TV cut off. I was spending too much time watching reality shows and bullshit that I didn't even like very much. I could spend that time working on my resume or going out. 

4. Updated my OKCupid account and started talking to several women. Got a date tomorrow. My previous MO was to go through dating sites with a fine tooth comb, trying to find the ""perfect match"" then start thinking how ""this could be the one"" then either got no reply to my nerdy boring messages or got one date that was awkward as fuck and didn't get another, then got depressed and gave up for months. I'm not doing that shit any more. I'm ultimately going to try to get a relationship. I don't REALLY want to be a PUA, but I need to learn your ways until I can find someone I really want to be with and can be with. 

5. Made a point of making conversations with women I see in public. Store clerks, etc. It's not as hard as I thought. If I keep it up, maybe I'll get a date out of it. 

6. Got serious once again about losing weight. I've lost 10 pounds since March. I've been doing a lot of walking/hiking/bicycling. 

7. Deleted my long term Reddit account. I found myself karma whoring and wasting way too much time talking to people who were like the me that I don't want to be anymore. This is kind of a throwaway account. I'll keep it for subreddits like this one and r/productivity, but when I get to any significant amount of karma I will delete it and start over.
I need some advice about a few things like: wardrobe (especially on a budget), how young is reasonable to try and date without seeming creepy, what to do about crooked teeth (again, not much money - I'm also contemplating a career change, so hopefully I can do more, later), how you got over the fear of approaching women in bars, any ethical/practical problems with dating women who have children. 

I don't believe it's hopeless and I am not going down without a fight. One thing that is so weird is that I beat the shyness professionally - I'm a newspaper reporter. I could interview the president and give no fucks. 

I've got a persona I put on that over the years feels like me, and I can be someone who is funny, entertaining and who people want to open up to - I just haven't figured out how to do it with women. I go into this mode where they find me so likeable - as a friend only, no attraction. I ought to be able to adapt my interviewing skills to dating...

Anyway, here it is. 

**Edit: Some great comments and advice here. Keep 'em coming. I've got a busy day today, have to work a little, then I have a date this evening, but I'll check back.**

Oh yeah, one question I meant to ask: 

What is your policy on who pays for drinks, food, etc.? I know David DeAngelo says not to pay, but it can be an awkward subject. Being a journalist, a lot of my prospects make more money than me!

I started studying David DeAngelo about a decade ago.  I had serious ""inner game"" issues -- I was stuck in the adolescent mode of being intimidated by girls I liked.  Now, thanks in a large part to the PUA community, I am a professional salesman.  

I'm in the business of meeting and attracting people, and I use PUA material every day to manage my relationships.  You could say that I'm a professional interviewer.  I'd like to think that I've learned a lot about how to approach and attract people, and I think you can use my sales strategy to become better at what you do.  I'm going to present this in sales lingo, so be prepared to translate to fit your needs.

- Be gregarious and friendly.  Talk to everyone you meet, whether or not they're likely to buy from you, and get their contact info.  Always be networking -- you never know when you might need a pipe-fitter, a restauranteur, or a puppeteer.  Stop for disabled cars on the road.  Know how to change a tire.  Help people find jobs.  Help recruiters find talent.

- Approach everyone like they were your neighbor.  Are you nervous that they might not want to meet you?  Why wouldn't they?  You're a great guy to know!  Maybe they don't need what you're selling at this moment, but who else knows a puppeteer who could show up for a puppet emergency at 3AM?

- Be the master of ceremonies.  Make sure everyone is having a good time.  Be sensitive to the needs and desires of those around you, and don't be afraid to bring it up to them privately.

- Be trustworthy.  Some things are best kept confidential.  Sometimes it's not about whether or not you can keep a secret, it's about knowing when you should.

- Know when to STFU and let the other guy talk.  Never, ever talk over someone.  Here's a good rule of thumb: if the other guy's talking, STFU and listen.

- Listen with your whole body.  Turn your shoulders toward her, respond and acknowledge what she's saying, and follow her eyes even if she's not the one talking.  Listen intently -- don't think about what you're going to say when she's talking.  It's OK for there to be a pause when she finishes for you to construct your response.

- Learn to read minds.  Mirror the body language of the person you're engaging, and you'll be able to read their emotional state.  Your emotions don't just control your posture -- it works the other way around, too.  Mirror her body language and ask yourself how it makes you feel.  Now respond appropriately to her emotional state, and help lead her to a better emotional place.  Meet her where she is emotionally, and then slowly lead her where you want to go.  If you fail to match her emotional state, you'll come off abrasive and repellant.

- Be the man of the moment.  You don't need to be in control all the time -- you are big enough to play a supporting role.  Know how to be an awesome wingman.

- Elevate those around you.  Be the player that makes the entire team look good.  Always look for ways to give credit to others.  Compliment people sincerely through third parties -- it will get back to them, and it will mean much more ""through the grapevine"" than if you told them directly.

- Take accountability for each interaction.  Don't allow yourself to use someone else's emotional state as an excuse.  Ask yourself, ""how well did I handle that, and how could I have handled it better?""

- Don't be a dick about it.  Approach people the way they want to be approached.  If you don't know, ask.  ""Hey, what's the best way to get in touch with you?  Do you prefer email, or phone calls?  When is the best time to call?""

- Never be afraid to talk yourself out of a sale.  Sometimes the best way to sell yourself in the long term is to be the better man and do everything you can to help the prospect reconcile with their existing supplier.  Never undermine someone else -- if you're really the better man, they'll do that for you.  At the same time, be prepared to give the ""come to Jesus"" speech if their situation is unsalvageable or if they're in danger of serious harm.  Do the best thing for the prospect, no matter what.

- Above all, understand that you are dealing with people who have thoughts, desires, and lives of their own.  If you get a negative response, maybe you approached them at a bad time, or approached them in the wrong way.  People have bad days.  If someone snaps at you, give them space, give them time, and be more careful about how you approach them next time.

",278,52,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/onwk0/the_inconceivable_transformation_of_myself_or_how/,"Six years ago there was an eighteen year old boy. He was quiet, shy, and frightfully inexperienced around women. This young man had a crush on a woman thirteen years his senior. She was beautiful, elegant, and had a certain movie star-like quality; in fact, she looked almost identical to Jennifer Aniston. 

Over the course of several years, he discovered couldn't escape her entrancing beauty. Unfortunately for him, his seemingly unconquerable social awkwardness was always in the way. Slowly, she discovered the crush he had on her, and carelessly dismissed it.

He found himself a veritable captive, stuck in his mind and hoping that she would somehow fall for him. But he knew that would never ever happen.

Then something happened over a year ago. 

He'd heard about pick-up artists, and started watching a television show dedicated to them. Trying to follow Mystery's advice, he found himself feeling phony and arrogant, but most importantly - single. The few times he managed to procure a date, he was hopelessly miserable trying to stay in character.

Shortly after, he discovered Seddit. It was an online community dedicated to bettering yourself and crushing those poisonous insecurities. He was frustrated at first, and thought that his goal was completely unattainable; he would be forever a slave to shyness and fear. 

One day, however, it all clicked. The solution wasn't necessarily learning new techniques, rather, it was UN-learning. He noticed how open and free children often are, completely uninhibited by insecurities that adults possess. They're free because they're not stressed about details. 

Fast foward to the present. 

Almost every weekend I'm going on dates. I didn't have to sacrifice my principles, or pretend to be something I'm not. Half the time women are asking me out, and it's simply because I'm enjoying life. I'm happy. Fear and happiness can NEVER reside in the same mind at the same time. Rather than focusing on conquering fear, I simply have as much fun as I can, as often as I can.

Oh, and that lady that I've had a crush on for six years, I made love to last night. The biggest crush of my entire life, the ""one who got away"", my Mount Everest was mounted on top of me. I suppose that's what motivates me to write this. I know there are people who think that success and change are far beyond their grasp, and they'll have to work with what they've got. That's not true. Everything in your life can be changed. Here are some seddit-inspired principles I've utilized to completely transform my life.

1: Be first. Be the first to initiate conversation, the first to offer a handshake, the first to go in for a kiss.

2: Notice shit tests and murder them, without remorse. ""But you're such a little boy,"" that woman told me last night. ""Yeah, and you're such an old lady, but you're still giving me an erection."" 

3: Hold your head high. Pretend like someone is constantly pulling your hair up. 

4: Don't give a fuck.  Do what you please. Make it aware that you're primary concern is enjoying yourself. My go-to technique for initiating ""Not-giving-a-fuck-mode"" is blowing a raspberry. It's the most playfully ridiculous thing anyone can do, and doing that helps create the playful attitude that I like to have.

5: Never make a woman your highest priority. Women can smell it a mile away, and it smells like shit. Pursue your own hobbies, create your own ambitions and desires, and never sacrifice your own needs. It's not being a douchebag, it having self respect.

6: Act, don't react. This is probably the most useful tool anyone can utilize. Don't be timidly sitting in the corner reacting to your environment. Don't quietly nod your head while someone selfishly rules the conversation. 

7: Oh, and eye contact.  Don't be focused on unecessary eye contact, it can be stress inducing. When walking through a store, I hold my gaze above people's heads and focus on what I need to do, not reacting to my environment.*Rule number 6* That being said, always hold eye contact when talking to someone. But again, act, don't react, and don't give a fuck. If the conversation is boring, poke her in the nose. Tickle her. Anything.

Hopefully these tools will help some out like they've helped me. Just have fun and be high energy. Don't absorb energy, but give it. Remember, most people dislike themselves and their lives, andf you're creating happiness then people will like you and good things will be sure to follow.

I go out dancing at least once a week. I know a lot of people in the salsa scene. I usually only dance with the girls I know. I very rarely do a cold approach on girls I don't know.

I texted him to see if he was still coming out, and he responded that he'd be there in a half hour. (He didn't actually get there until an hour and a half later)

The third would be to start doing cold approaches and make my own fun. I knew what Seddit would say I should do. So I sat there for a couple songs considering the situation. Finally I heard a little voice in the back of my head screaming at me, ""**STOP BEING A PUSSY!!**""

So I started asking random girls to dance. The first one shot me down. The second one said yes. The third one shot me down. The fourth one shot me down. The fifth one said yes. And so on and so on all night. I kept count of how many girls said no. My previous record for one night was 5. This place blew that record out of the water with 14.

Somewhere along the way, I started to actually believe what I've read here a hundred times. *Rejection doesn't hurt!* If you go into each approach thinking, ""I'm gonna go get rejected now"", you can't lose. You either get rejected, or you get a dance. (or in normal cases, a conversation) Either way, you're having fun. Getting rejected by random girls I've never met doesn't hurt me in any way. They don't know me. They've never talked to me. The don't know my friends. They haven't seen my job. The haven't seen my house. They haven't seen my car. When they turn me down for a dance, they're not rejecting me as a person, because they don't know me as a person. I know I'm awesome and I don't need anyone's approval to believe that. All it means is that they didn't want to dance with a guy they don't know that night. It's their loss!

Like others before me have said, it doesn't matter how many times you read this stuff. It only sinks in when you're in the field seeing it for yourself.

EDIT: Having re-read this and thought about it some more, I finally understand the relationship between inner game and pickup. If you need a woman's approval to feel good about yourself, rejection hurts. If you derive your happiness from within, rejection doesn't hurt. If you fear rejection, you will fail at pickup. Once you achieve inner happiness, you lose the fear of rejection, suddenly pickup goes from intimidating to fun. Then you start really improving your technique.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_o5gyn,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/o5gyn/fr_14_rejections_in_one_night_and_not_a_single/,

Since I was one one of those people who had no idea what to do. I figured I would give some dancing tips....


**Back Story....**
When I was first moved to the NYC area (2 years ago) I wasn't used to approaching girls on the dance floor...in Chicago at the clubs I would go to you could really just grab a girl and she would grind on you. In NY my friend and I go to mixed clubs (we often go to Fat Baby in the LES). I decided I would just two step all of the time in clubs and look nice but that wasn't working for me. One of my friends' college buddies called me out on it once, so from that point on I figured I would learn some new moves with a lot of trial and look like I'm having fun. I have had gorgeous women approach me just because I looked like I was having a good time. Now I use dancing as part of my game where I do the ""Copy my moves game"" and we switch off who leads or I try to teach them a simple dance move to them like the infamous Kate Upton Cat Daddy http://youtu.be/vPu4BbB4StI - How to Cat Daddy


**A couple of things to know......**
1) Its not a great idea to approach from behind unless you know what you are doing (especially in mixed clubs). I would tell everyone not to do this unless you can really dance well or she's already given you an IOI but she still may not want you to do it. 99.9% of the time approach from the side (I usually dance next to the girl and bump her on the shoulder to get her to notice I am there.) or from the front. Example of how to approach girls on the dance floor http://youtu.be/1fVpL7Je4Qc

2) Have FUN, even if you aren't approaching and are dancing by yourself look like you are having fun and people will approach you. The girl is dancing to have fun and you must add to the moment like Tyler says in this video....http://youtu.be/kd3Rs9FxguA

**Common dance moves at clubs....**

The Two Step - this can be literally be done to ANY song. The most basic of dance moves besides a head knod.
http://youtu.be/L3QrP1kiRko

Slow Grind - easy to do and it will get you brownie points if you know how to do it.
http://youtu.be/4s21sg0goqM

The Dougie - the song is almost always played in clubs and bars if you know how to do this dance you will draw crowds. 
http://youtu.be/NJxYiIfr4WM

Gangnam Style - this song is still played 
http://youtu.be/bjQKCLvtLN0

Salsa Dancing - can be done to just about any song and if you know how to salsa you will be The Man. 
http://youtu.be/PfDVnX4j3-w

Twerk (for the ladies) - everyone talks about twerking these days learn how to do it properly 
http://youtu.be/NgoyVRO0A0E



With all of this said, you really dont HAVE to know how to dance on the dance floor as long as you look like you are having fun and approach with confidence. BUT knowing how to dance gets you a lot of points with the ladies!


**Edit:**

If the girl is responding to you in a great way and turns up the sexual tension in the dance moves, then you can turn it up as well. Wait for her cues though, getting too sexual can get some girls to leave you quickly.

1305320366.0,224,self.seduction,hatyo,[FR] - Helped an AFC K-close with just a few pointers,275,51,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hatyo/fr_helped_an_afc_kclose_with_just_a_few_pointers/,"Hey Seddit, first time poster here.

I call myself a semi-natural. I never had much of a problem with meeting women as I'm outgoing, confident, funny and now that I've lost a lot of weight I'm told I'm quite attractive. That said, looking into PUA has hypercharged my game, making cold opens (my main weakness before) much easier, and the escalation ladder has helped speed up and ensure closing tremendously.

I was out at a local bar for a friend's birthday the other night. I wasn't really there to game unless I saw something I really liked so I mostly hung with my friends and opened a few sets just for practice, mostly talking to the guys so I could scope out possible single targets. It felt like a couples night as every group I approached was obviously ""together"" so I just used them as practice, had a good time and moved on leaving behind a table who were having a better night than before they met me.

Also out with us was one of my f-buddies (HB7) that is learning how to wing for me. A group of her co-workers showed up later, all geeky AFCs that I'd never met before. One of them really seemed interested in an HB6 at the bar. He'd got up the nerve to say ""hi"" but was otherwise stalled standing next to her while she talked to her friend. His body language was awful, trying to lean towards her nonchalantly. I took pity on him and called him over.

""You're having problems thinking of what to talk to her about, right?""
""Uh, yeah, I guess.""
""Ask her something where the answer doesn't matter. Some kind of opinion question. Those are the ones where the conversation can lead to somewhere, give you a hint about her, let you be playful and keep talking, unlike a yes/no question."" (I gave him a few examples, including ""my 16 year old sister wants to get a 'tramp-stamp' tattoo.. is she too young or am I just being overprotective?"")
""Huh.. that makes sense.""

I then explained the escalation ladder a bit, telling  him to try to touch her just a bit, but not creepy. Start with the hands, then hand on shoulder a bit when talking to her and keep it there *just* a bit too long, etc. He was rapt with attention to me and swore he'd do it.

I also told him my favorite way to get a number, which I think I first learned here on seddit. Open your smartphone, get to the ""Add a contact"" screen and just hand it to her.  No ""can I get your number?"" begging, just an unspoken command. I also do the ""give me your phone"" to send myself a text message (of ""You are cute!"" or something similar but related to the conversation) but felt that took more confidence than he had at the moment.

He went back, waited nervously a bit and then finally started talking to her. Her body language opened up a bit and they had a conversation. He couldn't see a way to touch her but I did.  I went over to him, shook his hand to say hi and then whispered in his ear ""She's wearing some bracelets. Ask if you can see them and when you do, hold her hand up with yours to get a better view. Hold on to it just a bit too long like I said.""

He grinned and when I walked away did exactly what I said. Her response was positive. Later on he was putting his hand on her shoulder to punctuate his conversation points like a fucking boss. I was so proud.

From there on he was doing well. Still a bit nervous but she was responding perfectly to his kino and was now invested in talking and hanging out with him. I decided he needed a DHV so I went over and said ""Oh shit man I totally forgot to thank you for that help with that project the other day. You totally saved my ass! You're the man!"" and did a little bow-to-the-sensei before walking away. I was the confident, good-looking guy bowing non-sarcastically to him and played it well.

When I got back to the group I was with I saw her put her hand on his chest for the first time with a huge smile on her face while she said something. My blatant DHV had worked wonders!

From there on he was on fire. He eventually did the hand-on-small-of-the-back when she leaned in to talk to him (it was quite loud in there), nervously at first but when she didn't freak out he calmed down. Eventually he handed her his phone.  She responded by taking it and then handing HER PHONE TO HIM to make sure SHE got HIS number!

Later I saw another girl sitting nearby talk to him (I think she made a funny remark about something he said) and when he replied he put his hand on her shoulder too and looked her right in the eyes. My small bits of advice had changed this guy tremendously. It was like magic.

By the end of the night he and HB6 were dancing together by the bar and lightly making out. He was constantly throwing me ""YOU RULE!"" messages behind her back, with thumbs-ups and silently-mouthed thank-you's. I'm sure he has never met a girl in a bar and kissed her the same night, but that changed after he met me. Him becoming a boss made me feel like an even bigger boss.

Though I didn't personally close (nothing I was interested in there) it was one of my favorite nights out so far.

Here's a little tip I've discovered to maintain solid eye contact and making your mind believe it's not awkward:

**You are looking at her eyes to learn the color of her iris**. Keep a count of blue, green, gold, gray and brown eyes as you walk down the street. DO IT. REMEMBER THEIR EYE COLOR.

This trick implies three known good practices:

* You look in her eye for more than miliseconds (in order to know the exact eye color). At least 1-2 seconds
* You *look* at her, not only *gaze in her direction*. You really need to focus in her eyes
* You lose the awkwardness because you're doing it for a purpose, not for the sake of being aggressive. I can bet you're not looking at people in the eye because of a lack of inner game. By establishing a purpose, your mind is more relaxed.

Practice this with girls walking down the street. Some will drop their gaze, others will return your look (more below) and some will even slightly smile. Then you decide if you want to open them or are just practicing eye contact. You actually have a great opener: they have [a nice eye color | eyes like some friend of yours | some strange eye color which caught your attention]. In one of my first days one girl actually gave me the ""fuck me"" look back, which kind of caught me off guard and I froze out. Damn. Yes, the kind of looks you would get at a club at 5am if you're gaming right. But it made my day anyway.

Regarding returned looks; if you do it properly you will be able to feel that girls look back at you in a more interesting manner (like: hmmm, is this guy checking me out? is he interesting?) rather than the usual ""oh no this guy is staring at me"". If you don't notice this, try to really focus in her eye color and slightly close your eyelids to make yourself more interesting and focused. Practice in front of a mirror.

Do this for a month and your inner game will strengthen. I've now discovered myself looking in the eye at everybody, not just girls, and people really notice it and appreciate it. Looking in the eye is a sign of respect and power.

1359298387.0,222,self.seduction,17dbiw,"[FR] Went out solo to a bar, left due to anxiety, got balls, and went back in. Results inside. ",298,76,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/17dbiw/fr_went_out_solo_to_a_bar_left_due_to_anxiety_got/,"So I live right beside a bar, having eyed it since I moved here, I finally go inside. As I am walking to the bar, I notice two older girls standing outside smoking, which impresses me cause its like 20 degrees outside. So, I go in and have myself around 5 Yuenglings. When I first walk in, the bar is dead, with the exception of the two older women from outside. After around 40 minutes, and 4 beers, the place is starting to get lively. Females are bountiful now. 


I try to work up the courage to talk to someone, besides the two drunk men who keep on stacking the jukebox with classic rock and buying me songs (Hey, no complaints here!), I have not spoken to any females besides the bartender. Anytime I would look at any female, I would involuntarily skirt my eyes. Anything I had read in the Tao of Badass or any other PUA book went right out of the window. I guess the true symptom of approach anxiety is being unable to control your mind and body to the extent of being unable to get stuff done.


I felt like ""That Guy"" and this made me pretty damn anxious. So I leave. When I am outside, the older woman (By older, I mean like maybe 30-32) smiles and we exchange pleasantries. As I am walking off, something in me sparks, and in a moment of perfect clarity, I ask for her a cigarette.


She happily obliges, and as we smoke, we begin to talk.    Turns out she has a Master's degree in Speech Pathology, which is cool because I am a reforming stutterer, so we had a lot to just bullshit over. Well, she finishes her smoke, and as I do, I decide to go back inside.


As I finish what is now my 6th beer, I finally get the courage to walk up to the cigarette woman's table, and just say thanks for the cigarette. She invites me to join her friends, I would say they were HB5 at best, cept for one cute girl who was like an 8. 


I introduce myself and get to know all three ladies at the table. I try to do my best to try out some techniques from the Tao of Badass. However, I am pretty drunk by this point, so I just really bullshit with them. However, I am mindful of the body language, and some tips from TOB that would pop into my mind. 


The girl that seems genuinely the most interesting was the HB8 who had just graduated from the same master's program that I am in. So, we get to talking, and she is just awesome. I remember subtle tips from TOB such as ""don't lean in and chicken peck, make her lean in towards you"" and ""make them chase you"". 



So I do things like that, and things are working out. She all of the sudden decides to leave which dismays everyone, but she promises to come back, and we all perk up. She tells me to add her on Facebook, which I do, and which she accepted this morning. I am actually proud I was able to drunkenly remember her name and actually add her. 


I keep on with the remaining two women. These women are way older than me, but also attractive and funny enough to be fun, so I stay and talk to them. This is where I hit my snag, one of the guys who were making monetary love to the jukebox joins us and completely captures their attention. I mean yeah, he was cool, and me and him had a really cool conversation about music. It's not that he was being a jerk, he just really attracted people, including me in a way of sorts. 


This is where the story runs out of steam. Nothing else happens, we all go home, which is just a 30 ft walk for me. I get two kisses on the cheek, so I feel good. I go home and pass out. I woke up to find the HB8 had accepted my friend request, so I have no idea where to go from there. 


What do ya guys think? I think it was a huge breakthrough night for me.  


*Update: Just asked the HB8 out, hopefully it goes somewhere. Fingers crossed for me!

I've got a quote for you: ""Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.""

*Preparation* is the time you actively spend working on yourself. Including going out in the field, reading seddit, listening to audio, watching videos, etc. As a rule of thumb, for every one hour you spend engaging with material you should be spending 10 hours in field.

*Opportunity* is the people and situations you encounter while you're out in the field.

You probably saw my [epic FR](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/r2a50/fr_absolutely_epic_night_fourway_with_porn_star/) from the other night. Had I not prepared myself to take advantage of the fortunate situation, I wouldn't have had my amazing sexual experience.

But that's only part of the equation...

---

**SOCIAL MOMENTUM**

Specifically, macro-momentum. This is the energy you carry with you if you go out on a consistent basis. 

The Friday night where I had the 4-way was my eighth night in a row going out. One night earlier I [got to observe Tyler Durden](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/qzr3n/my_review_of_the_simple_pickup_guys_and_tyler/) rock it in field. The night before that I [picked up two 20 year olds](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/qy7sj/fr_tofutofu_theengdude_pick_up_two_20_year_olds/).

I am convinced that my success on Wednesday night added to my confidence, outcomes-independence, and sexual energy that helped me have such an easy time on Friday.

Likewise, I am convinced that getting to observe Tyler Durden do his thing gave me extra energy and skills that I benefited from the following night.

I'm not saying you have to go out nine nights in a row like me, culminating in a drunken bender on St. Patrick's Day... But I am warning you that you're missing out on opportunities by not going out on a regular basis.

Let your social momentum carry you through. You'll end up a better person for it.

There were a shitload of hot girls around and gaming was really fucking hard. Guys were being drunk and hitting on everything and girls were pretty unreceptive after dealing with so many drunken buffoons. I had the brilliant idea at some point that in order to deal with this we just had to go super direct and aggressive. Open girls by telling them they're gorgeous and stuff. Opened her up with some random shit, don't remember and doesn't really matter. Friend winged her guy friend. At some point I told her to give me her number, and she declined. I told her something along the lines of: here's what we're gonna do, I'm gonna take you out on 3 dates, then after 3 dates I'm going to invite you over to ""watch a movie"", but we'll both know what that really means, and you'll come over and we'll fuck. She found this funny and said I could have her number. I made her write ""Movie Fuck"" in the description in the iPhone. She said we wouldn't have sex and I said ok we can do anal. We were both smashed, and I was being very aggressive. Proceed with caution attempting this. However, my aggressiveness is what got me the number, prior to that she was rather disinterested. Pays to be different. Not great ""game"" but I stood out from the crowd.


Next day I take a screenshot of the ""Movie Fuck"" contact page and send it to her. This is a trick I plan to employ over and over, especially when alcohol is involved and memories can get hazy. She later told me she never replies to her drunk numbers, but the ""Movie Fuck"" part intrigued her cause it was different. I then proceeded to text extremely forward over the top shit. Hundreds of texts were exchanged, I'll give some samples. Mainly of the fucking sea of shit tests I had to swim through. Starting right after we texted.

She sends a photo. She is beautiful.

Me: Wow you are beautiful. So long as your personality is good I'm going to have to seduce you.

Her: It's a push up bra

Me: Was referring to your face and hair not your false advertising cleavage. I'm an ass man though, let's see a shot from behind.

Her: I'm hanging out with my bro. Give me an ass shit.

Her: Hahahahahaha shot!

Me: Lol I'm not into ass shits

Me: You're dirty




The girl then drops that she's a model. Just casually into conversation. I ignore it and respond to something else. She does this several more times, I never acknowledge the fact that she's a model. I act like I don't give a shit and it's so uninteresting to me that I don't even want to discuss it. After I ignore her million model shit tests she sends me a pic of her in a dress taken over the shoulder. Accompanied with another shit test.



Her: Here's your butt shot. Don't try and seduce me anymore. It's not gonna happen for sure. I already have two guys on each coast and it's hard.

Me: Lol I haven't even tried to seduce you yet.

Me: I have 3 girls it's not that difficult. You give them too much attention.

Her: Don't do it. And what are you talking about. You're giving me so much attention.

Me: You're new. Everyone likes to play with a new toy.

Her: Jesus



Another time she asks me about some comment I made about some sad shit in my life.


Me: Long complicated sob story. I'll share it over pillow talk if we get there.

Her: Guess I'll never know. Dude stop.

Her: I like my bf. Did I tell you I have a bf?

Me: No.

Her: Are you crying?

Me: That's cool. I'm an aggressive flirt, can't really help it. You're not forced to talk to me.

Her: Obviously but this is fun right now.

Me: Lol no I'm not crying, I don't care if you're seeing 10 guys.

Me: I barely know you, just having fun.

Her: I'm an asshole.

Me: You're trying to be, yes.




At this point she's very engaged. Sending me (non-sexual) photos. Talking about our lives. Saying she's never done this before and is enjoying the attention. I tease her in a blunt way that only a very secure girl can take, call her fat, and also make aggressively sexual comments just to keep things interesting. We shit talk each other. I tell her to shut up. She would throw in shit about fucking her bf, coming 4 times, scratching his back with her nails. I ignored it and acted unfazed. However I know I have a decent shot. At one point when she was drunk she texted me ""bf is being a bitch wanna meet up"". I knew they were having problems. Our texts took place over probably 5 days. It's important to note the brief shit tests are between endless texts about our lives, childhoods, parents, goals in life. It wasn't all douchebag sexual comments, it was a combination. I'm highlighting these because I don't want to share actual conversations and personal shit and I assume everyone can have a basic text conversation.


The meetup. At one point she asks me about what I do.


Me: I dunno I'll explain in person. Kinda complicated.

Her: In person? When's that happening? I didn't get the memo

Me: I'll let you know when I decide

Her: What?! No you didn't

Her: You decide?!

Her: Geez so aggressive. Oh well. I'm aggressive too.

Me: Ooh that can be fun. You wanna take the lead then? [don't try to be so ""alpha"" all the time]



At this point she invites me out to hang out with her and her cousin for dinner. I'm not really interested in that. I tell her I have a date (I do) and I'll come by after if I don't fuck. She wants me to blow off the date and come hang out with her and her cousin. I don't, and ignore her couple of texts for the entire evening and don't talk to her until the next day. Before that she tells me my date will ""definitely bang me if she sees me hanging out with her"". I tell her that won't help because my date is way hotter than her. She wants weed for her cousin, I tell her I have a friend who can sell to her. She says she's never bought drugs before.


Me: I'm giving you new experiences then.

Her: You like that?

Me: Like what?

Her: Giving me new experiences.

Her: You're totally rubbing off on me.

Me: Not yet. But I'm sure I'll be rubbing on you soon.

Me: Oh wait did I misread that?

Her: Jesus. Stop it you freak!



Next day her and the bf have broken up. He was being an asshole apparently, and they've only been seeing each other a couple months. So now it's on for real. She's walking in a fashion show and asks me to meet for a drink after. I show up it's her, another model and two dudes. The girl is in her full model garb, hair, and makeup, looking like a girl out of a fucking magazine. She's several inches taller than me with her heels. I'm a bit intimidated. Introduce myself to her (as it's basically like we're meeting for the first time), we hug, introduce to the guys and other girl, go to grab a drink. She joins me at the bar and we start chatting. The other girl and two dudes (who were stoned and not friendly) decide to leave, thank god. We drink and chat. I'm quite nervous but so is she. I can tell she's nervous and I'm pleased I'm not the only one. The booze helps. I joke around with her, grabbing arm and leg for support while laughing hard (something I'm a big fan of as it's very natural and disarming). We drink strong drinks and catch a buzz quick. I open up two guys, a father and son and start chatting with them. They're visiting from Wisconsin or something. The son orders a round but the bar is cash only, he asks for an ATM. I tell him I've got it and pick up their round. Girl is super impressed by this. Really generous thing to do, because it's altruistic and has no ulterior motive (if I buy her drinks she knows I want to fuck her, I don't want to fuck these guys). Be generous to strangers, it helps. I didn't do that deliberately, I genuinely liked these guys and didn't care about the 10 dollars, but it paid off for me. Anyway we had talked earlier about bouncing to a jazz club to see some live jazz. I get the bill, leave the guys tell them to enjoy their trip and we go. She tries to pay for her share of the bill, I tell her she can get the cab.



At the jazz bar she buys us a round of scotch while I get us a table. I select a circular booth right across from the band. Circular booth is great cause she has to sit right next to me. She comes back with the drinks, I pull her closer and put my arm over her shoulder, but don't pay attention to her. I drink and watch the band while she's leaning against me. I'm really into the music, dancing and lightly drumming with my free hand. Occasionally we'll talk about how awesome the band is. The band asks for money. I give her a 5 and tell her to go put it in the bucket. She does. After a couple songs, we're sitting with her leaning against me and her face right next to mine. My mouth is next to her ear. I tell her ""give me a kiss"". She says ""here?"". I say ""yes"" and turn her head towards me with her chin. She does, we kiss for a few seconds and I cut it off. We chill for a while, the band finishes a set and I say let's get out of here. We decided to go to her place to drink some tequila cause it's close by. We argue, I'd rather go to my place not hers, but I relent. She orders a cab and we cab it there.


When we get there she pours drinks and put on music. We make out, it's getting heated. She says we're not having sex. I should go. I genuinely intend to go but we're in various stages of undress. I get up and put on all my clothes. Then I come over and make out with her again, to kiss her goodbye basically. I'm not big on pushing for sex, makes me feel sleazy, so I genuinely intend to leave. I think she saw that and it disarmed her objections. End up stripping down naked and having sex. She wants me to spend the night, I say I can't gotta bounce work early and go home. We chilled for 3 days straight after that and had a fantastic time.



tl;dr be absolutely shameless if you are dealing with an aggressive and over the top girl. this girl was a runway model who lived in paris and walked in the top fashion shows in the world, has had athletes and rap stars try to fuck her, who partied like crazy and was very blunt. i swam through a sea of shit tests by acting completely unimpressed while being sexually aggressive and unapologetic. we also bonded over life stories and things in common. don't ""game"" all the time.

**Edit:** since some people are commenting that this game is overly aggressive and douchey, I wanted to clarify that **that's the point. This girl was arrogant and dismissive towards me, and considered herself better than me.** See [this FR](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/haepr/fr_tokyoseddit_lords_over_shibuya_seduces_model/) and in particular this excerpt:

There's still hope, forever aloners.",354,130,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/l6ess/so_i_had_my_first_kiss_last_night_at_19_theres/,"Was playing board games with my friend and his frat brother when this chick comes over and starts playing with us.  I let my friend know I was interested, and he started laying the groundwork (great wingman!).  He started calling me ""BD"" every time he referred to me, and after the third or fourth time she was like ""Wait, why does he call you BD?"".  I looked her in the eye, and nonchalantly told her it's ""cuz I got a big dick"".

Honestly, I wasn't expecting it to work, but holy shit, it did.  She was so much more receptive physically after that.  Then she started complaining about a guy she was texting who ""didn't like her but always sent her dirty text messages"".  so my friend, being the amazing, triple-a wingman that he is, snatches her phone and tries to delete it.  She goes chasing after him, he hands the phone off to me, and she tackles me to the floor.

""Whoah, I know I said I got a big dick, but really?  Right here?""

Later that night, we all go for a walk around campus, and we start holding hands.  We're walking a good 50 or so feet in front of everyone else, just talking, having a good time.  Then she starts talking about that guy again and I just said ""Really?  Is this how you wanna spend our first night together?  Talking about some other guy?  He's sent you what, 1500 text messages was it, and he still doesn't like?  I've known you for all of one night and I already like you.""  This turned her to goo.  It was adorable.

Anyways, we found a bench to sit on, and I had no idea how to go for the makeout.  So I just asked.  ""Can I kiss you?""  To which she replied, ""I don't know...""...""Really?  You already dry humped me back in the room, this seems like a pretty logical next step.""  ""Ok fine"" and then she proceeded to shove her tongue in my mouth.  I never really envisioned my first kiss being quite that...raunchy, but it was nice.  Totally felt some titty too ;) we held hands for the rest of the night, and I kissed her goodbye after we had both sobered up a bit.

Looking back, I'm pretty amazed at how smooth I was.  I've never had any success with women ever.  My most intimate interaction with a women before then was holding this girls hand for like 30 seconds.  It's just 100% confidence, and I get that now.

Anyways, I just wanted to share with the internet, and let you forever aloners out there know that there is hope, and to be fucking confident.  It worked for me.

Edit: Oh, and I'm actually in her phone as ""Big Dick"", which I thought was funny.

If you got game, or found my title funny. You can just hit the back button. This wall of text is for the complete noobs, who have absolutely no confidence, no game, and feel hopeless.


Ever heard the saying ""if you don't use it, you lose it."" Nothing is truer in the world of dating. The problem with not having game is that it only gets more awkward and difficult over time. Your insecurities will eventually fly through the roof. If you are 18, 19 etc... fight through your social anxiety NOW! The clock is ticking.

1) Looks: I began working out, cycling, running, swimming, rock climbing. Looks might not matter according to some, but they can only help. DO CARDIO! You will feel better, you will be more confident, buy new clothes, shave clean. 

2) Make yourself interesting: Start learning new things. Chicks dig that shit. Once I started taking part in a lot of outdoor activities, talking to women (and meeting them) became much easier. If you spend your entire life playing World of Warcraft, you are going to have a VERY difficult time talking about yourself. She will find you very boring. Believe it or not, most women don't give a shit about your 25 man raids and the legendary sword you looted. But don't just pickup hobbies to have stories to tell. Actually go out there and do things you want to do - enjoy your life. Women like men who are happy.

3) Lower your standards: Unnatractive women are easier to approach. Its a sad truth. I had to go for women who were as desperate as me. Needless to say, it helped me greatly. Date online, flirt in person, meet women but set your bars low. I literally stopped giving a shit about my ego, or preconceived notions about who I deserve. Before I knew it I was playing two girls. I slowly upgraded over time.

4) Rejection: Take it. Live it. Love it. Laugh about it. LEARN FROM IT. Do not get attached and set your hopes on one girl. There are plenty of women, don't put an ex on a pedestal. Your world is only what you see, trust me when I say there is better out there that you haven't had a chance to see yet.

Where I am now: It took me 8 months, but I made it. I have slept with more unnactractive women than I care to brag about... But I recently was hooking up with a very cute latina, and am now talking to a beautiful blonde milf who is two years older than me. I have a date with a stunning russian with black hair and blue eyes later this week.
I am happy. I no longer care about my ex, I'm no longer bothered by rejections. I have more friends and am never bored. 


Where to start... If you were like me, a guy who had 0 game. You have issues, you need to work on yourself before you start reading hundreds of pages on how to pickup women. You are not a presentable package.

I dont consider myself a very good PUA yet, but the social skills and basic desire to constantly improve oneself really makes this appealing to me. I decided to try a few different techniques Id read about here with a few different women. Here is my Field Report of how Direct/Aggressive text game went (well, FB chat to be specific)! Enjoy!

~~~

BACKGROUND: HB08 I met at a party where neither of us knew many other people, we got chatting and clicked pretty well, but she had to leave early and so I only managed to give her my phone number. This text was about a week later:

~~~

**HB08**:
Hey. Whats up?

**Me**:
How the fuck are you beautiful? 
*(probably a bit too unnessesary swearing)*

**HB08**:
haha Good. Doing much this weekend?

**Me**:
Oh always! You? 
*(answered her, but left something for her to wonder)*

**HB08**:
Was meant to go to a mexican party then valley but I didnt get back from the markets so my friends left already...
So now nothing haha 
*(she is testing the waters)*

**Me**:
wow they sound like shit friends
go and do something 10 times as good and rub their faces in it

**HB08**:
They asked if I wanted to meet them in the valley... But I dont want to catch the train by myself or drive because then I would have to drop them home... Haha thats not gonna happen, I might just save my money
*(again seeing how I respond)*

**Me**:
go and have random awesome sex with a guy youve only ever met once 
*(we have only met once, cocky/funny/direct, turned the convo sexual quite early)*

**HB08**:
Lol I have never done that before nor would I ever do that 
*(shit test)*

**Me**:
yeah me neither, i prefer women 
*(I didnt slip into an apologetic frame, just kept my humor going)*

**HB08**:
Same.

**Me**:
hot! 
*(she replied with one word that killed conversation, she deserved the same back.)*

**HB08**:
Haha I joke

**Me**:
yeah sure you do, where the hell is *SUBURB* and why are you there?

**HB08**:
heading towards the *OTHER SUBURB*, Its where I live unfortunately 

**Me**:
woah that sucks!
how long does it take you to get to the valley? (popular clubspot)

**HB08**:
I tell people I live there and they go oh... 1hr by train

**Me**:
and you work there at 5am 
(prior knowlege from out actual in person conversation, showing her I remember her.)
... id hate to think what time you wake up

**HB08**:
What? 

**Me**:
im thinking of going up the *BEACH* this weekend 
*(Didnt want to repeat myself, just moved the conversation on)*

**HB08**:
Yea I want to go to the beach... Except I am pale and hate my legs haha 
*(shit test - seeing if i suck up)*

**Me**:
ah who needs legs when youve got those eyes 
*(I didnt suck up and tell her she has great legs, like she probably expected to hear, but I still complimented her)*

**HB08**:
I am going to get bored quickly tonight.... I am bad when I am bored.
*(she is escalating now)*

**Me**:
yeah you definitely look the type...better find something to do gorgeous... 
*(I respond to the escalation positively, but i dont give her too much praise too soon, im not desperate)*

**HB08**:
Haha hopefully.

**Me**:
for $20 il come over with a bottle of vodka 
*(phased like IM doing HER a favor - $20 is a joke to emphasize this, of course I wanna bang her but i dont want to show how much so soon)*

**HB08**:
Lol you, me and a bottle of vodka? 
*(shit test to see if I was joking)*

**Me**:
for $20.
*(didnt back down and say 'lol just kidding' simply repeated myself as if she was too stupid to understand the concept. RUDE, but worked)*

**HB08**:
Haha I dont usually let people come over... Just because my sister and her boyfriend. 
*(ANOTHER shit test, seeing if i am sure of what i want, or I back out at first resistance)*

**Me**:
ah youre the third wheel! i get it
*(brushed it off as if it was no big deal, didn't try to persuade her to let me come, just cocky funny again.)*

**HB08**:
That and they are annoying

**Me**:
thats why you could use some company! 
*(in a kindof 'i was right all along' matter of fact way.)*

**HB08**:
Yea lol I think its a good idea
*(score!)*

**Me**:
alright whats your address

**HB0**8:
*ADDRESS CENSORED FOR OBVIOUS REASONS*

**Me**:
alright, 9 ok?
*(didnt ask what time, just suggested one that suits me, its assertive)*

**HB08**:
Yea thats fine

**Me**:
i have the nicest vanilla vodka. il text you if im late
*(implying I'm a busy man, crude, but effective!)*

**HB08**:
All good I need to clean my room its soooooo bad haha I have clothes everywhere

**Me**:
goddam your house is a massive drive! Id better be able to crash the night! 
*(I know i shouldnt have said this, but her house WAS fucking ages away, i needed to totally CONFIRM I could stay the night before driving an hour and drinking only to find im stuck with no bed)*

**HB08**:
Yea of course you are lol
*(left it at that, no reply. went to hers at 9:30)*

~~~


I went to her house and F close. I'm not going to lie, I am quite cocky and direct normally but this whole interaction made me feel a bit TOO much like a douchebag, It's not something id be comfortable doing often! But obviously it can be quite powerful when used. MORAL! Great power, Great Responsibility!

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed my FR. This wasnt supposed to be a massive ego trip, or a look at me! post, but I genuinely have been helped by reading other peoples FR reports as I used to have NO text game!
If even one person is helped/inspired from this in the same way I was by another post similar to this, then it will have been worth it!

People like myself who have a strong affection for camping will rejoice in knowing that it is hands down one of the most effective date ideas.  After camping on a regular basis for the entirety of my life(20yrs), I've realized why its so easy and natural to create a seductive mood in the outdoors: fire!  Many of my most intensely sexual and memorable nights started or ended near a campfire. Why? For one, the natural lighting provided by fire is very flattering to muscle tone, complexion, etc.  Even more importantly, the activity of camping and/or building a fire in the woods is a very conjoining activity.  Away from electricity, phones (turn them off!) and other unnecessary distractions.  Just you and an attractive partner. 

I suggest everyone make at least a couple dates with girls (or guys!) that involve camping or building a campfire.  I guarantee you will notice it eases tension and makes flirting a lot easier.

When we talk to people, we are communicating in more than just words, every piece of information we send them is part of communication. Research from Albert Mehrabian suggests that body language and tone of voice make up over 90% of actual communication between people. This is why you need to be conscious of the signals you're sending to others that you're not verbally saying.

Females of higher value will begin to judge you from the second you lay eyes on them. When your eyes meet and you look away, you have already shown signs of passiveness and weakness. These are not traits of a confident, successful male. And females of the type you're going after are undoubtedly attracted to men and manly traits, otherwise they'd all be lesbians. You want to show qualities like confidence, dominance, and manliness.

First things first, it is imperative that you hold her gaze and go into it with the knowledge that you're fucking awesome. What you do after this is all a matter of personal style and twist. I keep a pensive expression on my face the first 2 seconds, and then switch to a smile than can only be described as if I'm seeing her slowly strip her clothes off in front of me. Keeping pensive and not smiling for about 2 seconds is vital. It is characteristic of successful people, as mentioned by Lowndes in her book ""How to Talk to Anyone""

The mood you set in your mind is reflected through your actions and how you communicate. Is is vital that you're not worried about her catching you staring at her. On the contrary, you should have the mental state that you caught *her* staring at you. Because, after all, you did ;)

Eye contact should last about 5 seconds, then communication needs to take place. It has to happen that second or else it will just be awkward...so don't be awkward. It can be verbal or non-verbal. If you can't talk to her, do something funny or just play around with her. Be memorable. Be unique. Catch her attention.

If you do this right, you will almost immediately begin to notice that women are more receptive to having a conversation with you, assuming you're not some ugly fuck that doesn't know how to wash his hair and you know how to keep up with good posture.

But, this is just the first 10 seconds or so. You're on your own that that :P

Edit: I can't stress mental state enough!!! It sets the tone for the entirety of your interaction with someone. It is the absolute primary difference between alpha males and AFC's and it is what makes or breaks your game. When AFC's are contemplating the undesirable consequences of an action, hegemonic males are thinking about how much fun it will be. 

I know it's a corny example, but the only difference between Tyler Durden and Jack in *Fight Club* was, you guessed it!!! The state of mind.

I guess that is fine and to be expected. But, what seems to be lacking is a general overview of what’s going on out there in terms of the shifts in the culture, how this effects male/female sexual dynamics, and how game plays into this reality. 

THE SEXUAL MARKET PLACE

I’ll start here assuming you know a little bit about supply and demand. Also think of the buyer/seller dynamic.  That said, western culture has changed in a way that has totally shifted the dynamics between men and women and now there is a lot more power in women’s hands and both women and men have handled it poorly.

Women used to have their status attached to the guy she married, usually shortly after highschool. If she chose right, he was successful and her social status climbed as a result. This was the ideal for many women. For others, simply a stable guy with a job to provide food and shelter for her and the children was enough. 

Then some things changed, some technological, others ideological, and still others political and economic. Refrigerators, stoves, washers/dryers, and vacuum cleaners, for instance, greatly cut down on the time required for housework.  Feminism encouraged women to get educated, seek work, vote, participate more in social life, demand social equality with men (some in the manosphere bemoan this, others do not…irrelevant for my purposes here). Later, birth control expanded and this allowed women more leeway on their reproductive careers. Laws have changed to give women more social provision (welfare), safety (domestic violence laws), and easy access to divorce (no fault divorce laws). Women now make up the majority of college students and most expect a career. 

In short, women now do not have to simply sit back and choose between the first 3 o 4 guys to ask them on dates and decide which one to marry. They have tons of options, access to resources, more free time, career opportunities, etc.  And, this means marriage at a young age, or if at all, is less and less a pressing issue for women (and men, of course).

HYPERGAMY

What the above has done is diminish the restraints previously in place that controlled women’s hypergamous impulses. Guys tend to want to sleep with a variety of women; women tend to want to trade up in their partners, i.e., guys with higher status, which could be looks, income, the badboy that turns her on, etc.  Sure, men would like to fuck upward toward the hottest women, but really they just like to fuck a lot of chicks across the board. Tiger Woods did the Waffle House waitress. Do you think Angelina is gonna do the fry cook?
So, women’s new found freedom in the sexual market place has given them not simply more choices but more ability to be choosy, to seek new higher status cock. Married women do this all the time, as do girlfriends and neighbors. Just read the forums and find guys complaining all the time about their women chasing some new asshole with game, with money, with status, with looks, or whatever. 

SHIT-TESTS

But some things haven’t changed. Not only do women get turned on by high status alpha males, but they also have no incentive to begin approaching men in the sexual market place on equal terms. Yes, some women will approach, but they don’t really have to. It is still mainly the guy’s responsibility and thus women want to have their cake and to eat it too. And why shouldn’t they? They get approached all the time regardless of the changes discussed above. 

So, with all these options and with guys still having to approach, women now screen guys more than ever. They screen for two things, mainly. (1) Are you alpha/high status/smooth/sexy/confident around women, etc? and (2) Congruence. If you present yourself with the traits of (1), then they need to find out if you really are who you say you are. So, shit-tests test for congruity. 

Sometimes this is intentional. But often women do not even know when they are doing it. The irony is that they ALWAYS know when you fail.

Also, wanna know what women’s expectations are? Just for a small sample, go to an online dating site and check out all the 30-50 year old women who are ugly, out of shape, with very little to offer and they are asking for “Mr. Right”, “Prince Charming”, “A Soul Mate”, etc. Totally deluded but still convinced that some ridiculous dream romance with a top dog awaits them. Now just imagine how younger hot girls think.

GAME AS A RESPONSE, NOT AS AN ISOLATED AND INVENTED SET OF TACTNICS OUTSIE OF SOCIAL REALITY

Game did not develop in a vacuum, outside these conditions above. Rather, as culture, the sexual market place, and sexual dynamics changed, a few guys started to figure out that something was up. What the hell is going on out there? Why are women so picky, choosy, manipulative? Why do they blow out seemingly good men only to literally blow the asshole/bad boy/alpha guy in the bathroom stall? Why do they ride the cock carousel into their thirties and then find themselves hitting THE WALL, single, miserable, and wondering “Where are all the good men at?”  

These guys started to try to deal with the new reality.
Some of it was a bit formulaic, like the Mystery Method, filled with rules and routines. 

But game evolved and something called a “natural” was hit upon. This view basically evolved from guys who were already good with women trying to figure out and conceptualize what they (or others) had been doing that worked. Sometimes they were not sure why, but over time more men caught on and started to theorize why certain aspects of game works. 

This has led some guys to dig deep into evolutionary psychology (a controversial area) and others to offer very harsh critiques of liberalism and feminism.

From the outside, “game” looks like simply sleazy tactics of desperate, angry losers who are bad with women. Though you can find these guys on any forum such as this, this is not the origins of game. Nor do these guys explain the need for it. 

Success with game techniques also makes some guys look like Machiavellian poon hounds. This drives women critics crazy, but these guys also have the most women, which probably also drives the female critics crazy. 

Game is the new and evolving way guys are figuring out how to deal with women in world that has changed though no one told them (or the women) that it had.  As has been said, it’s a tool, one forged by necessity, the mother of invention.

Over the years of this happening I developed 3 Simple Guidelines to help me decrease the chances of Last Minute Resistance or even Complete Resistance. So without further ado,  I'd like to present 3 Methods that you can try out for your self and let me know if it worked.

Here's a video of my infield demonstrating this: http://youtu.be/ZNoSIVe-biY


**AMBIGUITY OF VERBAL INTEREST:**


One thing that has become abundantly clear to me was that DIRECT GAME can sometimes naturally place you into CHASING FRAME in the female perspective. This can stifle your mid-to-end game since she may not be invested enough to go all the way with you. If you really think about it, how do women meet men in Social Circles? They usually get to know him in a friendly way first, and then it transitions into romance. The question is why does this work? Well, for one, the girl does not know if the guy really likes her or not since guys in social circle settings are generally a lot more careful with regards to showing romantic/sexual intent too soon. By her not being too sure, her guards a much lower while, simultaneously, she is confused about how the guy feels about her. For instance, she may wonder, ""Does he like me just for sex or does he like me for more or is he just a friendly flirty guy with no intentions?"" This is CHICK CRACK. Women NEED MYSTERY. Women love to figure things out. Just the act of her truing to figure you out is often enough investment for her to be attracted to you. Look at all the novels, its all about mystery (and I don't mean they guy with the fuzzy hat:).  Let's take a quick look at some examples of Ambiguity of Interest.

On the Conversation opener, approach her with a friendly vibe... make her wonder what you want. Don't give her the validation of you professing your undying love for her. Instead, mix things up always. Compliment her, then say something you don't like or agree with... then say things like ""you would be such a cool friend/ but then physically escalate like a flirty hug. Confuse her.

Ideally, make your MIX VERBALS with a mixture of interest and disinterest. You will notice that she will always be more invested since she is not sure and will always give you the benefit of doubt.


**STEADY AND PROGRESSIVE PHYSICAL ESCALATION:**


Progressive physical escalation is key. Remember, physicals will impact her SUBCONSCIOUS MIND much louder than your verbals ever could. Therefore, by the simple act of progressively increasing your physical intimacy, she will become sexually attracted from the inbred 'Man-To-Woman' attraction triggers within her hind-brain.

To further emphasize the power of touch, think about it this way... A woman can get sexually turned on from any man if they are touching her in the right places. For men this is not quite true, men get sexually aroused by 'visual aesthetics'. Women are turned on by touch. For instance, if an ugly man is laying in the bed with a hot woman, if she allows him to play with her clitoris she will get turned on and want his dick. The more she wants it, the harder it is for her to fight it. .

This is why it is important to keep on touching. I'v had girls tell me that I am too touchy... But guess what, that was the same reason why I would eventually get to sleep with them. Touching is an art form that you will have to practice over time. My recommendation is just to work yourself into getting more comfortable touching people in general.


**SHOW HER THAT YOU ARE NON-JUDGMENTAL:** 


Let me make it plain and simple. GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO CONVEY that you are NOT going to judge her for her sexual past or present. Here's why. Women will ALWAYS ASSUME that YOU WILL JUDGE THEM even if you haven't said anything to support it.

I will often tell her a story or rant about how I hate how people judge women for their SEX life etc. I will also try to show it in my demeanor by seeming casual and free spirited about life in general. You ultimately want to convey that you are ok with whatever her past is. If she does tell you a few things, make sure you seem like it's completely normal. I would often mention a side story about a girlfriend with a relatively 'worse' past than hers so she can feel better about it.

Once she feels like she won't be judged if she acts on the attraction that you've accumulated in the back of her mind... then she will be much more sexually expressive and to the point with you.

I used to struggle with dates ALL the time a few years ago. It would always crush me when I put in so much work to finally get a few dates, and yet the dates would still feel as if I was not getting any closer to success. 

For those who wish to see my Live Infield Pickup &amp; Date Video: http://youtu.be/4TipN5gUaKw?t=2m41s

Here are 3 simple things that you can start implementing on your dates as soon as humanly possible.

1) Have MULTIPLE AREAS to take her to. 

One of the main reasons dates go flat is because people depend on ONE location to seduce the woman. The issue with this is that it increases the chances of the vibe going flat. If the vibe goes flat and you're still in that one location, then you can easily take her to the next place. This will help to somewhat reset the vibe of the interaction. Also, this adds more of a serendipitous feel to the woman as you taking her on an adventure.

2) Focus on Romance and NOT Sex.

I remember in the past, I used to focus strictly on getting sex on dates. This is not a good thing to do, especially on 'sober' dates during the day time. Instead, I focus on ROMANCE. Women value ROMANCE much higher than sex any day. Remember, even an ugly woman can sleep with a hot guy if she wants to. However, women do anything to find that special someone. I am not saying to lead her on... But Just sprinkle some romance in your interactions. If you notice in this video, I start doing things that her boyfriend should do such as wiping lint off her face etc. This will ultimately get the girl more into you and it makes sex much more likely to happen.

3) SHOW INTEREST

It is better to be interested, than interesting. In other words, do not focus on you seeming like an interesting guy. What happens is that girls usually do not feel any closer to you just because you say awesome stories. Remember, women love to talk about themselves. If they are a bit quiet in the beginning, give them time. Ideally, you want to be show her that you are genuinely INTERESTED in getting to know HER.

1) If you find yourself doing something just because you think it will make a girl like you or want you...stop.  Don't do it, even if it works like a charm.  If you are still a ""nice guy"" and aren't confident in yourself yet then these actions are, believe it or not, hurting you...badly. As a matter of fact don't do **anything** with the sole purpose of earning affection.  That's called being manipulative, and it isn't being nice at all!  Having the attitude of ""What do I have to do to win their affection?"" is going to leave you alone and miserable and make others feel like they don't know who you are--which doesn't get you laid.  Doing this may lead you to think, ""Well if I don't do these things I've learned how to do, what do I say or do to people when talking to them?""  In this case...

2) If you find yourself not knowing what you should do, ask yourself, ""If I didn't think I would offend/turn off/disrespect anyone with my next choice of words or actions, what would they be?  Pretend you are in a consequence-free environment.  How would you act?  If you have the inclination to be really rude or short with people (I do admittedly when I'm feeling weak or powerless), remember the want to hurt others is manipulative, too.  What you're striving for isn't to try and get emotion out of other people, but to...

3) Be completely honest with yourself.  You know what you want, you're just afraid to admit it.  But all you have to do is admit it to yourself!  Don't even say a word!  Just be honest when you want something, **even if you don't want to want it** Seriously, it's okay to want something or someone, even if you wished you didn't.   If you want the girl admit to yourself you want her.  If you want to wear a ball gag and be spanked, admit to yourself that you do.  It's okay, seriously.  Keep away from opinions of yourself when doing this.  Only focus on more direct things like your wants and needs.  If you want to get laid by that girl at work, admit that you do.  If you look at porn for hours a day, admit to yourself, ""I look at a lot of porn.""  You may be ashamed of this part of you, but whether you are ashamed or not it is who you are.  Once you start sorting out the inside of your head, you'll find it easier to...

4) Be direct with others.  You know what you want, right?  You're being honest with yourself (as much as you can) and feeling like you're finally acting on desire and not what you think you should be doing.  But how do you convey this honesty to others?  Directness!  Granted in seduction being indirect is a powerful tool (in a way this whole subreddit is based on how to indirectly be direct, lol), but I can tell you now if you're a ""nice guy"" being too direct is the least of your problems; I can tell you with 100% faith you probably would be a lot happier being more direct than you are now.  This works for good as well as bad.  If you want to hang out with a girl again, don't wonder how to word it.  Just say it however it comes out.  If you want to kiss her, go for it.  On the other hand if some hot girl you want to have sex with asks you for help and you don't really want to, be direct and honest with her.  If you don't, then *don't*!  It's okay.  Don't come up with an excuse why, or say it's not your fault.  Just tell her you don't feel like it.  It seems like this is a really prick-ish thing to do but you won't be a bad person for doing it.  And crazily enough, the sky will not start falling.  

5) (Warning, if you're an avid porn ""connoisseur"" and fap a lot, what I'm about to say may bother you.  Don't read this paragraph unless you are ready).  Every guy in life has a girlfriend.  Every guy--only some of them aren't real.  Instead of a living, breathing girl, many guys turn to other activities to take the place their girlfriend would.  The most common is...porn!  There are other types of girlfriend replacements, but they are all just substitutions for real girls.  By looking at porn your mind is trying to recreate the feelings (horniness) that you would feel if you were with a real girl.  So whenever you go look at your favorite Gianna Michaels flick, you're in a roundabout way pretending she's your girlfriend for however long it takes you to finish.  Even if you don't look at porn your internal fantasies are girl substitutes, too.  You know that one fantasy girl you have in your head who's favorite hobbies are holding hands and anal?  Yeah, she's just a substitute for a real girl.  This doesn't seem like a problem in itself, except that it will make you that much more complacent with not getting laid.  If you can watch some wicked hot deepthroat video that completely satisfies your sexual desire for a while, then part of your incentive IRL is gone.  This isn't to say porn or sexual fantasies are bad, only that they're n inadequate replacement for the real thing.  Real women offer so much more than porn does, but some guys get stuck in an infinite loop of porn, trying to fall in love with it, in a weird way.  I'm honestly not saying you should stop looking at porn, fantasizing or even fapping.  But think about this: when you start surfing PornHub or go inside your head and start reliving your ""blonde twins in the Jacuzzi"" fantasy, you are settling for a fake version of real feelings.  You are telling yourself, ""I could date a girl, but I choose to date a website or my imagination instead.""  Just understand this at first, and the rest will come slowly.

So, if you're a ""nice guy"" try this stuff.  Seriously, give it a shot.  Cut the bs.  Quit trying to be James Bond or Cassanova and just be you.  You aren't them, and when you try to act like them you come across as a tool.  Yes you can learn seduction techniques and they may even work, but I can tell you wholeheartedly that you will be much more satisfied with your life in all areas if you learn how to be yourself first. Then you can learn seduction. :-)",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1353554428.0,,,True,t3_13lp1y,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/13lp1y/as_a_recovering_nice_guy_i_thought_id_share_the/,

1325706849.0,220,self.seduction,o2vts,Wanted to share my story of going from socially anxious to a guy who's had sex with 7 women in the last year...,287,67,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/o2vts/wanted_to_share_my_story_of_going_from_socially/,"The main point I'm trying to get across is find YOUR method of attracting women. 
After a 4.5 year relationship dissolved, I fell into a position I hadn't been in since I was 17: Having no one to have sex with. I had huge social anxiety even with my best friends because of a bad experience in high school. I would have trouble texting people I called friends, let alone girls I liked. 

What did I do? I sucked it up and literally called everyone in my phone until someone could hang out. I always phrased things passively such as, ""Are you interested in..."" I spent the next two months burying myself in friends. I got comfortable with who I was and who I wanted to be. 

After I ""got over"" my relationship, I started actively looking for girls. I was terrible at flirting but, on paper, I was an amazing guy (tall college grad early, has a job, climber, in decent shape, love to cook). I started using this to my advantage. When I would meet a new girl, I would ask her questions, listen, and maybe drop in a hobby. I didn't brag or elaborate but rather let the stereotype do it's job. It always pays to have hobbies you suck at too (for me, I suck at writing and drawing). Basically, I would seed the idea of me as a good date and then walk away. The next time I bumped into the girl (find an excuse the first meeting if you really want it to happen), I would ask her to dinner.

Now, at first, this caused me terrible anxiety. I could hardly breathe and screwed it up a few times. After a few successes, however, I learned to love the feeling. If I don't feel nervous about the prospect of asking a girl out, she isn't right for me.

I'm assuming many people on reddit are geeks/nerds. I'm no exception. I want anyone I'm going to date to accept, embrace, and potentially join in with my geekyness. What I learned, however, is not to wear geekyness on my sleeve. If I can postpone my nerd for a date or two and let it out slowly, it becomes an aspect of myself rather than a defining feature. 

So much of this subreddit is devoted to picking up girls in bars. There are a large number of girls that maybe go to the bar once a month or less. I have never picked a girl up in a bar (I've tried) and am much more comfortable in different social settings. Since my big breakup 10 months ago, I dated a girl for 3 months, got a stunning f-buddy, have gotten there with 5 other women. I've got a second date tomorrow, first date saturday, and my f-buddy is coming into town next weekend. I came here to tell you to find YOUR game and not borrow the game of others. If you steal my strategy (TM) I will hunt you down.

**tl;dr Find YOUR game by pushing your comfort zone and seeing what works for you. Don't go to a bar and expect someone else's perfected strategy will work the first time.**

edit* 
A lot of people have been asking where I meet girls. Mostly the girls I meet are friends of friends. The first thing I did was expand my friend base. At one point, I had a party and told people friends were welcome: 35 people showed up when I expected 12-20.

reasoning and explanation) ",267,55,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/npy1w/one_way_to_overcome_approach_anxiety_with/,"I have heard again and again.

I'm fit, reasonably attractive, nice, i can talk to women after i have met them once or twice, or if i'm not into them, but i just don't know how to meet someone and just say ""hi...."" and start a conversation.


I was once like you, I was once stuck in that rut and just couldn't for the life of me start talking to a stranger and constantly made excuses not to talk to them. e.g Oh she must have a bf if shes waiting by herself. Oh look at that platonic male friend they must have something going on. oh mm she looks busy better leave her.


If this sounds like you. here is how i overcame it.

_______________________________________________________

There are a few things that i have found important on building up to talk to that attractive woman that you just cant approach.

I find there are a few things to take into perspective that many people(including myself) have overlooked.

1. They are human beings, not special, not different, not a strange things. just like you and I. don't think of them as women, think of them as people.

2. People, love to talk. honestly they really do. they love to talk about their clothes, their animals, or even what happened on tv last night. remember you don't even need to talk much once you are both comfortable.

3. Girls like to meet people, in fact nothing better for a woman to have someone talk to them, tell them that a stranger(you) has taken interest in something they have done, or in the way that they look.
make it your duty because Heck none of the other AFC's out there will let them know.

4. They don't know you, they don't know you cant talk to women, they don't know you may suck at kissing, they don't know that you may not be a good boyfriend for whatever matter. BUT DONT DONT DONT you dare make that decision for them, let them find out how much of a douche you are... sometimes girls go for the douche anyway.

Right now down to business, these are the small steps i made to approach the most threatening beautiful woman at my campus.

A majority of human conversation, since early days has been through actions, not the words itself, but expressions, arm movement and the state that you are in, they all play a role in communication in general, and you can use them to your advantage to working up to a actual communication.

This involves the following
- State of mind
- Body posture
- Eye Contact
- Smiling
- Finally comes the talking

these are all important when approaching, but often come naturally for some. 

**- State of mind**

~~~~
This Is important for all things in life, everyday communications between other males and all people. If you have a weak state of mind, it will show, if you have an alpha state of mind, thus will also show. i really do like the fake it before you make it phrase as face it, you don't need to be cocky or show it, but you don't need to hide the fact that you keep fit aren't ugly and are reasonably nice and awesome.

For me every day i say look recovering_beta, you are hot as shit, these woman would love for me to spend a little bit of my day to talk to me, in fact if i don't they won't know how good a life knowing me could be, or how much fun we can have together. they want to know me, and just don't know it yet.

Build your mind, don't be beta, be that alpha guy you see with a flock of women around him, be that alpha that doesn't put up with shit, be that alpha that is actively out there talking to women heck that's what you are, so be as awesome as you can.

“women don't want a nice guy, women want an awesome guy.”-anon


**- Body posture**

Simple really, stand up straight like someone is pulling  your hair up and pulling yourself straight, good posture for approach is good to help the state of mind, nothing better than being the most dominant male in the room at the party or in town. Be the tall guy that they all want that is awesome as shit. Just do it.

**- Eye Contact**

Now here comes the scary bit, but one of the most important, if the other two steps come naturally, this is the one to take note at. I have heard around 70% of communication in person is dealt with different ways other than words, communications isn't just talking to them and them talking back it takes everything into account.

The thing to do here is NEVER NEVER NEVER be first to look away, Actually don't because its beta as shit, no woman wants a beta male, they want the alpha that looks  her in the eyes, knows what he wants and isn't afraid of her, another person. Because when you look down to the pavement or look away first it shows your beta and don't want to talk to them because you are fearful. 

So as you walk around town, see someone you like, look them in the eye, do not look away first, just hold it. You don’t need to be creepy, just be friendly and approachable, be in your nice “awesome” state, the state that everyone likes and wants to be around.  
In nature you often see primates and other animals don’t look in the eye to avoid contact and prevent confrontation, e.g never look a silver-back gorilla in the eye.

This is different with most human beings,(depends on location as well - don’t get stabbed now) There have been cases of people getting stabbed for that, that’s why the next step is important to note.
So one of the steps in overcoming approach anxiety is, eye contact don’t be afraid to look them in the eye never be the first to look away and soon you will notice differences in people, notice how alpha and true your state of mind is, that you aren’t beta.


**- Smiling**

Smiling is important and goes hand in hand with Eye contact, it can stop you from being a creeper, and make you a friendly person, it shows higher value, and can make someone else's day much better. 

I have seen someone driving their car with the  biggest smile on their face, for some reason I was having a bad day and I saw this and I couldn't help but smile myself, and forget about the bad things, and saw her happiness and in turn that was somehow transferred to me.

Smiling is used in conjunction with the rest I have made someones day just by walking past, holding eye contact, then while holding their gaze simply smiled, and I had that returned to me. This is one of the easiest things to do, because you don’t even need to say anything, just walk past looking at her in the eye, and think ”wow she is pretty”.  That’s the kind of smile you want to have just like you are enjoying your day being awesome and simply noticing someone else that in turn made happy just from me smiling, its simple it works you can make them happy and make them approachable without even talking.   Think of how easy it is to talk to the cashier at the supermarket when they have a smile and look you in the eye.  Treat your life like that with everyone you meet, be positive, and make everyone else’s life around you better.


**- Finally comes the talking**

Talking is one of the biggest fears most people have, mainly because its someone you haven’t met and “STRANGER DANGER” 


----STEP 1

For me I started off small, at first all I could talk to was cashiers at the super market, they are great to start with, most of the time friendly, they don’t mind small talk and almost all of the time forget who you are. In super market mode they can forget you just went through the shop in 3 hours (super market anyway).  They are paid to listen to you and talk, and be friendly, so this is a Non-Threat approach. Once I felt comfortable enough talking small talk with these women/ladies. First step complete.


----STEP 2

 The second step is to talk to someone that isn’t there to give you a service or sell you something, now keep in mind state of mind, posture, eye contact and smile. The easiest way for me to strike up a convo is during action things, or when you are right next to each other just doing something for example, filling up a drink bottle, waiting for a bus, waiting in line for a concert or sitting at the shared computers. Anywhere two people are simply doing similar things next to each other. With this you don’t need to say the dreaded “HI.. my name is..”.
For me it was at the microwaves on campus to heat your lunch, god this microwave takes forever… so what u cooking there?

Mentioning something about what you’re doing, non-threatening; you couldn’t care less if they respond. You are just doing what you’re doing may as well strike up a conversation it’s the normal alpha thing to do.

You need to do this with anyone at any time, waiting for the bus with the old lady, waiting in line at the super market, just think of something related to what you’re doing, and remember it doesn’t matter what it is, because they aren’t likely to remember you the next day unless you get their number or talk to them for more than a minute.

Once you have done this more than 10 times and are comfortable its time to move to the threatening  people.

----Step3


Now these are the ones that you may have thought are too intimidating, too scary to approach the ones that are a 8-10, in your books, the ones that would never give you the time of day.

Here is where you are different, you are not beta you are alpha, you are there to talk to them when everyone else is too scared, this is when you need to focus on the first 3 steps, build your state higher than ever before, be the best man/woman you can be, Eye contact, Smile. 
Talk.

Just do it, you have done it before, she is just another person, honestly make her day better by letting her get to know you, find out a bit about her show her interest.
Pretty much don’t be beta be the alpha you are, access that alpha within you. If you can talk to a nanna, she’s a person why can’t u talk to this one, they are just people most of the time they don’t know how pretty they are, just like you don’t know how alpha you can be.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_npy1w,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/npy1w/one_way_to_overcome_approach_anxiety_with/,

As a hobby musician, I would be critiqued endlessly on my lyrics, voice, style, content, even my use of reverb. It always made me feel inferior.

Perhaps I was too open to suggestion when I was younger. I grew up with sisters that insisted there was a definitive difference between the gods that do these things professionally and the little folk like us. There was a barrier that I couldn't cross and it stuck with me.

It wasn't until a few years ago that it really struck me. People had always critiqued my music, but I'd get conflicting critiques. That's when I realized that these critiques were just opinions. The most unique artists in the world do what they do in spite of critique.

Inner confidence is knowing that nobody will ever understand your mental state, motivation, and goals. Some people will be close, but nobody will ever really know these things as well as you.

So don't give weight to other people when they say things that aren't positive.

The number of times my friends assured me that a girl didn't seem interested when she ended up very interested is astounding. Don't rely on them. Don't rely on anybody. Even if a girl you're after seems unimpressed- **assume that's because she doesn't yet know you well enough to be impressed**, and then press on.

Nobody thinks you'll win the lottery either, but every day so many people do.

1335368380.0,212,self.seduction,srvr7,Unexpected observations on the road to becoming alpha...,260,48,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/srvr7/unexpected_observations_on_the_road_to_becoming/,"I'm a guy like most everyone else here, transitioning from the ""AFC"" to a man trying to make the most out of myself. In my time my inner game has improved dramatically, and I've discovered true inner game isn't at all what i thought it was. So below I list some of the once-unexpected things I face every day to becoming alpha.

1) It never ends. You can always keep finding issues to improve, which is why it is important to understand your accomplishments are not you.

2) It keeps getting harder. The more you believe in yourself, the more challenges you take on. The more others believe in you, the more challenges they will throw at you.

3) Some want you to fail. You will threaten others, even some really cool alphas you thought liked you. They do, until they percieve you as a threat. They may become even angry or violent. Yes, other threatened men are more apt to try and kick your ass. It's all part of the game.

4) You still fail. You're human, but you have to shrug it off.

5) Most of the attributes of an alpha can't be faked, which is why we respect those who possess them.  It takes hard work, desire and a little luck to become a legitimate alpha. That is why success is hotter to a woman than money. Playing an instrument is sexy because it takes self-discipline. You get the idea: no shortcuts. The hard work is where the satisfaction comes from.

6) It's all up to you. No one is going to flirt with a girl for you. You have to ask for a promotion to get one. Sure, you may get some handouts, but you could get a lot more by being proactive. Animals at the bottom of the food chain take what food they're given. Animals at the top go after what they want to eat.

7) It's worth it. The satisfaction that you sincerely tried your best and are doing everything in your power to be the best you can be is all you need to keep going. Everything else just takes a back seat.

8) You can only change yourself. A few of my friends aren't as far along the path in inner game as I am, but I can't show them how to realize their potential until they get it. You will sit and watch others suffer and there is very little you can do about it a lot of times. It sucks but it's true.

9) This one is crazy. You may not care about seducing women as much as you did. I realized I used sex with women as a way to boost my self-esteem. But when I finally learned to be okay with myself my need for outside validation disappeared. Now I still pick up, but because I want to have a good conversation (let's see what she has to say), not need to get laid. And when you approach a woman without any ulterior motive everything just opens up.

That's all I've got. Feel free to add what you want.

I still suck, however, I want to share a bit of insight that I always thought was bullshit until today. 

***

I've been working out to get back in shape for some time, and it's been a long, drawn out process with gradual, but constant successes. 

I got started to get over my ex girlfriend...well, not exactly. I got started to try to win her back. 

I feel great. I eventually got over her. Also, I'm 20 lbs lighter, full of energy, and in a great mindset.

But anyway, I started to reconnect with a woman who I had a crush on for about a year (before I even met my ex). She's super fit, cute, and a great person all around. 

Problem is that because of this, I never thought I was good enough to ask her out and get beyond a first date. I know this is a huge mistake around these parts. Bear with me. 

So I worked hard to continue improving myself. Took on reading, painting, kept busting my ass in the gym. 

Where did it get me? **Nowhere** - I found out that she WAS into me a lot, and I never made a move. I finally got the confidence to ask her out a month ago, however I never got to see her in person. I thought email was lame. Well after not seeing her around the office for some time, I find out that now she's got a boyfriend. 

***

So today, boom - it pops into my head. I finally figured out why I should be improving myself, **FOR ME**, and to not do it for anyone else in particular. 

If I improved myself years ago, I wouldn't have had my tail between my legs about this girl. I would have asked her out and found out if we would have worked out together or not already. 

If I improve myself - if I work hard to boost my mental and physical fitness, my confidence, my career - everything - I'm opening the door that I've constantly been closing for years. 

I'm opening the door to approaching any woman with confidence, whether it be a woman who I just met, or one who I had a crush on for 12 months. Single women, attached women. Whatever. 

I'm opening the door to work harder and be more fulfilled in my career. 

I'm opening the door to finding new ways to set other personal goals. 

I'm opening the door to making a better life for myself. 

And yes, women will come from the effort. 

But I'm not doing it for them. I'm doing it for me. They're just a fringe benefit.

1316232665.0,215,self.seduction,kie45,List of Text Game drafts,285,70,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/kie45/list_of_text_game_drafts/,"Hey guys, 
I only recently found seddit and realised that Text Game basics were being posted all over the place. In my phone I keep a whole heap of drafts for different purposes when texting girls, feel free to add your own or copy them. Alot of these I didn't come up with but use them all the time, basically they work.

**Pings** - Getting a girl to reply


*""I just met your twin in town, she wasn't as rude as you though :)""*
This usually leads to a girl texting back trying to qualify, over exaggerate something that she did/didn't do.

*""Been hitting on many other guys today?""*
I always text this right after I meet a girl during daygame, one of my favourites.

*""Turns out I'm 20% more awesome today, how was your day?""*
Use this a lot one or two days after I meet someone.

*""Guess what""*
Obvious.

*""We need to talk, I think I might be pregnant :)""*
Its funny, always warrants a reply

*""you never write, you never call. The kids want to know when mum is coming home. What am I supposed to tell them?""*
This is brilliant, instantly brings in a role play which can last much longer than you would ever expect.

*""Going into surgery tomorrow, pray for me!""
Be VERY careful with this one, I upset a girl quite a lot when I said this out of the blue. Follow up with *""I have to get my awesomeness reduced by 40%""*. Make sure she realises its a joke, it fluctuates emotions, but must be done correctly.


**Booty Calls** - Usually need to be fairly calibrated for this

*""Bible study... My house.. tonight, look pretty for Jesus :)""*

*""you should come around for pizza and sex soon""*
Will probably get a negative reply, a simple *""you don't like pizza? :(""* works wonders.
Don't have many of these because they are very risky.

**Fluffing** - Stuff that just fits in almost everywhere

*""Lucky I'm a moral rock""*
Say this after anything sexual, use at will really.

*""No booty calls after 11pm please, I need my beauty sleep""*
Helpful to tag on towards the end of a dying conversation after you have said goodbye.

If the girl is commenting on how you're up late, or if you plan to still go out late, and she's wondering how you're not falling asleep or whatever just say: *""No rest for the wicked""*.

If anyone has any more that work for you feel free to post them and I might add them to the list. I have all these messages saved into my phone, I suggest you do the same. Don't ever use the same one twice on a girl, you will become boring very quickly. Good luck and have fun.

1302400683.0,214,self.seduction,gmhew,"This week in AskSeddit: blanking out mid-conversation, conversation threading, and girls' stares",258,44,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gmhew/this_week_in_askseddit_blanking_out/,"Hey dudes –

So glad I decided to post TWiAS this week, because it reminded me of an amazing conversational technique which I'll talk about in the first two items below.

""This week in AskSeddit,"" if you haven't seen it before, is a round-up of some of the top posts in Seddit's companion subreddit [AskSeddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit), which is where beginner and/or specific-situation questions on pickup and seduction should go.

Without further ado:

---

**#1. [It's not that I have AA, it's just that I really don't know what to fucking say after a certain point..](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/gkia7/its_not_that_i_have_aa_its_just_that_i_really/)**

So KolHaKavod has no trouble with approaching – respect, dude – but finds his mind going blank in that initial ""death-zone of awkwardness"" during the first few minutes after you've approached.

Worth noting is that he doesn't seem to feel like he needs to eject or radically rework his approaches – like Tofu has said, you just need to plow through those few awkward minutes until some comfort is established and things flow more naturally. So OP just wants to figure out how to keep his jaw moving.

And someone mentioned the awesome conversational technique I alluded to – **conversation threading**. I first read about it on seductionreview.com, which is down, but you can read a cached/copypasta version [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/gkia7/its_not_that_i_have_aa_its_just_that_i_really/c1oe11u).

Basically, instead of trying to invent shit out of thin air to talk about – which is great if you can pull it off, of course – you just riff off whatever the girl says. That doesn't mean she's leading the conversation, just that you're using key words as jumping off points. From that article:

&gt;If you come across a woman in a shopping mall and she says “I’m just shopping around for some jeans with my friends”, you know that you can thread off to talk about:

&gt; 1. Shopping (“There’s this store on the second floor you’ll love…”)

&gt; 2. Jeans (“I hope you’re not one of those who goes for ripped jeans”)

&gt; 3. Her friends (“Your friends seem like a great group of girls. How do you know each other?”)

&gt; Can you see how easy it can become with some practice? You can take any of the above responses and use them to keep the conversation going.

I think naturals and pros do this automatically, but for everyone else it's an awesome skill to learn.

So awesome, in fact, I reposted it in the comments on our next item:

---

**#2. [First date in 2 years.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/gjxvn/first_date_in_2_years/)**

HigherThanStars has the same problem as the previous guy – trouble keeping a conversation going – but there are additional complications. This first-order conversational problem creates a second-order confidence problem, to the point where he's nervous approaching or meeting OKC dates, because he's worried he'll freeze up in conversation.

I suppose one could say both of these problems are due to a deeper inner game problem, and one commenter went in that direction, noting OP's ""inferiority complex"" and trying to talk him out of it. 

If that's right, here's the order of casuality: confidence problems &gt; conversational problems &gt; additional confidence problems. It's a vicious cycle.

Why am I splitting hairs here? To try to show why IMHO it probably won't work to just tell OP to relax and try to have fun. I mean, by all means try, but it reminds me of advice from girls to ""just be yourself."" Easier said than done.

Instead, IMHO the best short-term strategy for OP would be a concrete strategy like conversation threading, to try to get a positive cycle going: learning that skill should give him more confidence to approach, and success when he does, which in turn gives him more confidence. In the words of that article I quoted above:

&gt;If you can master this skill **it will increase your confidence when it comes to approaching** women, because you know how to start and fuel a conversation.

It's sort of like what I think I've heard Tofu (et al.?) say about Mystery Method. To paraphrase, it's a bunch of technical maneuvers that don't in themselves do shit for your inner game – you can memorize all the best openers and still feel all rainy inside. ;_; But they *do* equip you pretty well to go out and close some HBs, and *that* success improves your confidence.

But long-term, OP should probably work on his confidence issues directly. (Take that advice with a grain of salt – it's my gut read on these things, but I haven't gotten around to going through Blueprint or anything like it yet.)

**#3. [What do you do when a girl gives back a stare?](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/ghq42/what_do_you_do_when_a_girl_gives_back_a_stare/)**

strangerdream is making confident eye contact with girls, and because he's a sexy bitch, they look right back at him. What should he do next??

Please do not post this video again.

We understand that the people who post this video are trying to bring useful materials to seddit. But this sort of video is a distraction to our community. This is a publicity stunt for his comedy tour. If we permit this off-topic video, this sets a bad precedent. Other viral video promoters will follow, claiming their materials are relevant. Soon people will argue that ""inspiring"" TV commercials, music videos, and comedy memes should be permitted as well. We have to draw the line somewhere, and this is where we are drawing it.

Please do not try to argue that this video should be permitted as an example of seduction principles, or that it shows ""frame control"" or some such thing. All the people in this video are actors (including the interviewers) and they are performing for the camera. If you view these flamboyant performances as examples of seduction, you are internalizing a media fantasy. They are selling you an idea that is not congruent with your reality, or anybody's reality. seddit is not buying what they are selling.

1349902818.0,210,self.seduction,119t9y,Opinions(ego) vs. Facts [Inner Game],250,40,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/119t9y/opinionsego_vs_facts_inner_game/,"I came to a startling realization regarding my inner-game that is often referred to as “clicking” around these parts. I figured I would share it here in the hopes that it may inspire someone else. Please keep in mind the majority of the following tome is my personal distillation of books I have read and my opinion.

The majority of humanity does not exist in reality. That is the majority of your decisions and actions are made through the haze of opinion or ego. Essentially these are short cuts hardwired into your brain through a combination of DNA, your observation of others experiences/behavior, and your own personal experiences/behaviors. These short cuts are incredibly useful, for example don’t jump off a 30 story building. Most of us have never attempted to jump unaided off a 30 story building onto solid concrete, because we intuitively know that this is not the smartest decision we could make for a long and happy life. The problem with these short cuts is they are antiquated particularly in a social sense. Also a big majority of input for your ego (your life experiences) is purely happenstance the environment you were raised in, location of birth etc. you could go on for hours. An even bigger problem is that they compound on themselves as you make decisions based on these opinions. Pretty soon your brain has convinced itself that you have as much chance of getting a date with statuesque blonde at the bar or becoming a CEO of your own company as you do of surviving that nose dive off your office tower. Here are some real world examples of your ego/opinion coloring your observations.

     
* Wow that guy parked in the handicapped spot without a sticker he must be the world’s greatest douche-nozzle: **OPINION**   
* Wow that guy parked in the handicapped spot without a sticker there must be some sort of emergency: **OPINION**    
* There is a guy parked in a handicapped spot without a sticker:**FACT**
    
___________________________________________________

* That girl is 5 inches taller than me and absolutely stunning she would have absolutely no interest in me:**OPINION**
* That girl is 5 inches taller than me: **FACT**
  
___________________________________________________________
  
* That girl just rejected me she must be like all the rest of these worthless bitches: **OPINION**     
* That girl just rejected me I knew I could never measure up to a girl like that: **OPINION**  
* That girl at the present moment in time has rejected my approach: **FACT**
  
Most people’s first reaction upon accepting these statements is “DESTROY ALL THE EGOS” however this is not possible or necessarily healthy again it is your ego at work

* I have an ego and it is making horribly negative decisions for me: **OPINION**
* I have an ego: **FACT**

None of the people browsing seddit would be here if weren’t for our egos. The ego is responsible for most of humanities successes and advances in the same breath it is responsible for most of its short comings. What to do? It is incredibly difficult the ego is probably the single most manipulative bit of programming that exists in our brain. There is a vast difference between making an opinionated decision and a conscious opinionated decision. Become aware of how your ego is impacting your decisions and its negative powers disappear. The next time you decide not to approach, start your own business, ask that boss for a raise, take your relationship to the next level, tell that friend how you really feel, or react to any of the above ask yourself “am I considering the facts?”

1334361883.0,210,self.seduction,s8scf,Proposal: a weekly thread tl;dr of the good information learned that week from seddit to archive them for later use.,241,31,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/s8scf/proposal_a_weekly_thread_tldr_of_the_good/,"Okay, seddit has a LOT of content, but a lot of that good content is disorganized.  There are some great tips in guides, some hilarious lines and methods in random FRs in the middle of a walls of text, and some great comments in a semi related discussions on a thread.

So here's my proposal: A way to consolidate all the good information from one week. A ""bestof"" tl;dr of seddit, a weekly archive of all the good tips, comments, and discussions.

Every week, the moderators create an official thread. Every cool tip, comment, and tidbits from posts on seddit is posted that week by the users of seddit. It'll have the same name every week, and will be made on a specific day. This way, it's possible to look to the past of seddit much easily and find information. All you have to do is search, ""Weekly thread"" and you'll find a repository of all the good little tidbits and tips from that week. It's very similar to the weekly simple questions thread on many subreddit.

For example, I read an FR and there's an awesome little interaction in it that I think would be helpful, but not everyone has the time to read FRs. I post that part in the weekly thread of good tips and post the link. It would pretty much be our weekly summary of seddit or tl;dr of information for the week.

For example, here's a good roleplaying tip I found. A post in the tl;dr weekly thread would be like this. First a tl;dr of what was learned, the context, and an important excerpt of the FR/Thread with the link.

-----

Weekly tl;dr 4/13/2012

tl;dr of what was learned: whatever subject you guys are talking about, play as an authority figure and let her be the other person, such as professor and student, or cop and potentially ""bad"" person. This will work well to segue into a sexual convo and get her turned on by the use of innuendo and sexual role play. It's harmless, fun, and very simple.

FR example:

&gt;Getting Sexual

&gt;""I'm an architectural designer,"" she says.

&gt;""Is that the same thing as an architect?"" I ask.

&gt;""It is. But I don't have my license. So legally I can't say I'm an architect.""

&gt;""Actually..."" I say. ""I'm the architectural police and I came here to check to make sure that you would honestly say that. So. congratulations. You passed. I'm not going to arrest you.""

&gt;She's laughing hard now. ""Fantastic,"" she says. ""It's such a nice day though, I think you would let me get away with it.""

&gt;""Really?"" I say.

&gt;""I think so,"" she says.

&gt;""Why would I let you get away with it? Are you pretty convincing? Do you have ways of convincing me not to arrest you?""

&gt;""I don't know,"" she says. ""I guess if it did come down to that, we would have to see.""

&gt;Both of us are feeling this amazing sexual tension.

Let's do something like this, I have seen too many tips and FR's lost to the way reddit's sytem is handled. We don't have a good system of wading through old posts as reddit only allows you to go page by page, you can't skip 1000 pages back.

There was live music and the crowd was going crazy for a certain number they were playing.

I asked a girl standing next to me if she knew the song/artist.

She said ""Ofcourse! It is &lt;so and so song by so and so artist&gt;. You don't know this?""

I said ""No!""
And we got to talking. We transitioned from topic to topic very easily. She was genuinely friendly.

We got to talking about beers as she was drinking some beer and I asked her opinion on the beer that I should try at this bar. So we headed towards the counter and stood behind someone as it was kinda crowded. Out of nowhere, this huge guy came and stood next to us. I saw him through the periphery of my vision but I was focused on our chat as it was very interesting. She was a complete beer aficionado and she knew her stuff. I teased her a little bit about her taste and gave a little rub on her head to mess her hair up after a particularly funny situation.

""Hey! No touching!"" the huge guy said sternly!

I was completely caught off-guard to this turn of events and all my senses went numb. I didn't know what to say!

I mumbled a 'Hi' thinking he was her boyfriend.

She interjected ""Hey this is my friend Jason"" or whatever his name was. He had his eyes fixed on me as if he was going to eat me raw. The girl on the other hand was very very embarrassed.

She nudged him to the side as I made my way to the bar and bought the beer she had suggested. I saw her arguing with him.

A little while later we bumped into each other and I told her that I liked the beer.

""Your friend is very possessive. I am scared of him and so I am going to stay away from you"" I put my hand on her shoulder and moved myself backward instead of pushing her away. I learnt this trick from the youtube ""how to kino"".

She was very flustered and said ""I am really really sorry about him"". She brought over a friend to convince me that the guy was harmless. I still walked away, smiling, and joined my friend.

What I interpreted from this situation was that guy was obviously an orbiter, an AFC, and was trying to 'protect' her from scavengers like me. When in-fact, he just ended up embarrassing her and fell down even more in her eyes.

Guys, please don't do this! Ever! You are not anybody's bodyguard. If the girl is fine talking to a stranger there is no reason for you to be paranoid and be all protective. Instead of being the protective father figure, you come out as an insecure douche-bag who has nothing better to do than stand like a bouncer next to two people who are having a good conversation.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_ij6cy,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ij6cy/guys_please_dont_do_this/,

This is resident moderator liquidxtension from [/r/gothamseddit](www.reddit.com/r/gothamseddit). We've got a great growing community going on here and if you're a New Yorker looking for some amazing people help build your social skills with, join us!

The following is a FR that I wrote yesterday and I thought it would be beneficial to share it with the rest of seddit community. You're feedback is welcome. I always feel like there is something new to learn.

Cheers.

I'd like to keep these two FRs short and to the point and discuss what I've learned from my experiences.

**Date 1**

After an amazing night with another date on Friday night, I felt great and ready to tackle more. I moved up one of my dates to Sunday with girl I met on the subway about three weeks ago. Suffice to say, I wasn't super excited, and I felt like I had this one in the bag.

Sunday comes by and out of nowhere I had a random call from my coworkers/supers to see if I'd be willing to help out with something related to work in the city. Since I was going to be in there in the city, I figured I might as well.

The whole time the date was my secondary priority. I just felt like it would go like any other last 3 successful dates I've had. Each date I've progressively pushed myself for more and I've been seeing results. 

We eventually meet up near Solas and when I saw her..she looked gorgeous. I didn't immediately realize, but something inside was holding me back. 

Soon as we started talking, I became enamored by the conversations we were having. They were stimulating for me and caught me completely off guard. She was a gamer, geek, sports fiend, film enthusiast....she was dealing all the cards of what I would consider a girl I'd totally date exclusively and I didn't know how to handle it. I slowly regressed out of state.

The most irritating part of it all? I knew it was going downhill. I saw she was losing my attention, I hardly tried to push kino, I was just talking because I just wanted to know more about her but I was not showing any reception that I wanted something more. I became the chode, the person who would not go for something what he wants, but hopes it would come to him.

The night was nice and relaxing, but uneventful. A kiss on the cheek and a goodbye. And I knew it was the last time I would see her, and I just lost my chance with someone amazing.

Next day, she texts me that she didn't feel a connection. I wasn't surprised.

***What I learned***
Calibrate yourself at all times and do not lose yourself. If you realize something is going wrong, don't just sit there and let it continue. Fix it. There was so many ways I could've salvaged the situation through the date, show her the initial charm I showed her when I first met her on the subway. Sadly, I fell into a pit of infatuation and let her get the best of me.

""Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.""-Oscar Wilde

**Date 2**

I've been trying to set up a date with a person I #closed for awhile. After a bit of patience, she was finally interested in seeing me again last night at a classy whiskey bar.

I had the experience from Sunday on my belt and kept it in the back of my head as a reminder of what not to be doing. I also had all the experiences from my other dates to remind me what I did right.

I meet her at the bar and I was immediately was faced with a problem. No seats at the bar or tables. Fuck.

But I stayed calm, collected, and smiled and said I know another place right down the street we can check out. Turns out that place was closed right now. Fuck.

By now, my old self would be freaking out, lose state and frantically decide to do something stupid. I didn't. I kept my frame and kept talking to her, said we're going on an adventure and we're going to look for 230 5th, which was nearby. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it anywhere....

I look at her and say, ""You're such a bad luck charm. This has never happened to me on any of my dates.""

She laughs and then I immediately ask her to tell me one of the worst dates she's ever had. It keeps us both entertained while I slowly calculate what to do.

In the end, I decided we just go back to the bar, grab a drink near the bar even if we don't have seats, and wait until one opens up. She agreed and we headed back, and coincidentally, we did get seats.

The thing is, the logistics of the seating position sucked. I was sitting across from her and I hate that; there was really no way for me to move next to her. Whatever, I'll do with what I have.

We grab a few drinks and have some great convo, keeping it light hearted but interesting the whole time. Compared to my last date where I just wanted to have intellectual convos, I'd try to lighten it up by making jokes, keeping things fun. Whenever I got the chance, I lightly grab her hands and play with them or squeeze them when I can. 

Eventually, we decided to move. I offered to take her to a place near her dorm. As we were walking out, she was telling me a pretty interesting idea she had and I thought it was funny. I kissed her on the cheek and called her adorable. I noticed it caught her off guard but she was smiling. I didn't care. I kept going.

As we were standing on a corner of a street, I was telling her how bad her idea was and then I move in extremely close and ask her if she wants to know what my bad idea was. She said yes and I go in for the first kiss. No resistance at all.

Afterwards we walked together down to Lillie's and it was pretty packed as well, but had enough breathing room for us to interact. She offered this round of drinks and I appreciated it. We talked and I kept moving in and moving out from her, eventually geint closer and going in for another kiss. This time it lasted a lot longer and it was much more intimate. We get seats at the bar and now I start being a little bit more aggressive with touching, keeping my hands around her legs, have my hands wrapped around her arms. I go in for another kiss after another solid conversation. More solid make outs. 

It was then when I realized she was extremely turned on. She started whispering, ""oh my god."" 

She eventually told me I'm a really good kisser, in which I responded with a smile, ""I'm quite aware of that."" (Funny enough two weeks ago, I had a date tell me I'm a terrible kisser.). 

As we walked out of the bar I went in for another close and she couldn't resist. For the next 30 mins or so we hit hard, and I could hear her moaning and swearing to god. It was such a turn on for me. 

Eventually I walk her back to the dorm. We have another quick makeout session and contemplate whether she should bring me back up to her dorm. She makes an excuse her room mates are sleeping by now and that she doesn't do this on first dates. 

Some of you will disagree and say I should've pushed further, but I want to keep this girl around longer. I decided to not go for the fclose. 

I end it with one final makeout she tells me, ""I definitely want to see you again.""

Fin.

***What I learned***

Never ever lose frame. If things seem like they're going wrong, stay cool, smile and make the best of it. Eventually if you handle the situation properly, you are most likely to see things smooth itself out. Optimism is key guys. Really. Pessimism never gets you anywhere.

I want to re-iterate that seduction, yes, is about being bringing the alpha male out from the inner you; but alpha males care and love everyone in a brotherhood sense and make sure that everyone; even those who fail our expectation as both men and women; are given value. 

So please curb the talk about how ""This one AFC was a real bitch and couldn't ever drop his balls"" or how ""this one girl was really not interested and probably is a slut"" etc etc.

*Give value*; don't even expect it back.

- stayed home all week (video games / TV shows / movies)

- Never would have talked to a girl, or dreamed of approaching an unknown girl 

- Never kissed a girl, never held hands with a girl etc.

- Never been on a date

- Never had a girl really attracted to me 

- 178 Pounds, 34-36% bodyfat 

What I am now/have done since then:

- Approached over 50 random woman (in clubs/bars/gym/benches/parks/walking down the street/grocery stores/dry cleaning stores/restaurants/coffee places/in my apartment complex and so many more random areas!)

- Been on several dates

-  number-closed 25+ girls

- K-closed 6 girls (4 of which same night)

- Have 3 dates lined up in a week 

- Very very close to F-close (I'd say within the next couple of days, one of the girls I'm currently seeing has straight out told me she wants to sleep with me soon..)

- Go out several times a week (when I don't have intense university weeks) 

- Have several girls attracted to me!

- 140 pounds, 16-17% bodyfat

And I'm not even close to being done. I just feel so much more comfortable walking down the street with confidence, conversing with people (men and woman) with more confidence, not caring what people think of me, not being phased by rejection etc. Seddit you started me on this amazing path, and I want to thank you, my life has been changed.

Tonnes of advice for new people inside.,259,49,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/n6ygl/my_first_full_close_tonnes_of_advice_for_new/,"I am so happy right now, not just because I slept with a girl a few days ago, but because it's clear evidence that I've made the right changes in my life.  I was an AFC, and still am probably a recovering AFC, but I have changed.  This was my first post to seddit three months ago:
http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/jpjiy/first_post_on_seddit_intro_and_my_field_report/ .  

I was always scared to view women as sexual beings and be okay with the fact that I am also a sexual being.  My goal was to have a girlfriend by Christmas, someone of good moral fiber that I truly liked.  After 20 posted FRs, saying hi to at least 20+ people on the street everyday, opening 300+ sets, many number closes, and day 2's, I have succeeded!  I found a girl who is beautiful on the outside and inside.  She's not the only cool girl out there, but she's definitely one of them.  Women are such wonderful, beautiful creatures.

I didn't start learning game to get laid like a rockstar.  **I just want to find the love of my life and live happily ever after.**  However, real life doesn't work like it does in the movies, and it's so different to what is given to us by the media.  But I believe it's possible.  Knowing that if my relationship ends, that I have the skills to go out and meet tonnes of new people is such stress-relief.  Ironically, it's what keeps this girl attracted to me.

Here are a couple things I've done to change myself.  **This is not keyboard jockey crap**.  This is all from my own personal experience in the field.  These might not work for you, but they have worked for me:

* **Honesty**:  I don't like lying or deception one bit.  I decided that I was tired of trying to act like someone else to try to get attention.  I didn't want to put up a front for anyone, whether it was my friends, coworkers, mother, or lover.  One of the best things I did was have a frank conversation with my mother about our different values: http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/jykl3/what_to_do_when_your_values_are_incompatible_with/ .  Release your fronts.  It feels great to admit when you are sad, happy, angry, frustrated, etc.  Do this and women will do the rest as far as forming an emotional connection with you.  They're so good at that.

* **Setting Goals**:  Realize that your number one goal as dictated by nature is to survive and reproduce, as Mystery says.  Getting good with women is one of the greatest accomplishments you can have in life as opposed to what society may say (money, fame, education, etc.).  Make getting good with women a priority, because it's important for being a man.  Make sure you don't give up your life for the sake of women.  You need to love yourself first and do what makes you happy.

* **Genuine Self-content**: I am 100% happy being single, by myself, and living life.  I do not need a woman or anyone else for that matter to be 100% happy.  It's fun and nice to be with a woman you like, but I don't need her to be happy.  Knowing that a date or relationship not working out will leave you back in a state of 100% happiness is much more awesome than worrying that someone might leave you or not be interested in you and you becoming AFC pitiful because of it.

* **Always being in state**:  http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/lui5z/getting_into_state_two_kinds_of_approaches/

* **Outcome independence**: Never expect anything, whether it's a girl being attracted to you, kissing you, having sex with you, etc.  If you are fine regardless of the outcome of your interaction, then you will protect yourself from disappointment and open the gates to the world to rinse, repeat, and improve your game.  Edit: Remember to keep abundance mentality!  It doesn't matter if you mess up or if a girl isn't into you or if a girl is already taken.  There are plenty of awesome women out there.

* **Self-amusement**: People, everyone you interact with, are your personal entertainment.  Entertainment meaning you interact with them, make them smile and laugh, because you find it fun and funny to do so, not because you want to make them smile and laugh.

* **Be a giver**:  Creeps are people who want to take something sexually from women.  Manly men give women the pleasure of being sexually attracted to them.  Don't just talk to single girls.  Talk to everyone, guys, taken girls, married couples, bartenders, waitstaff, janitors, etc.  Make everyone's day better off.

* **APPROACH**:  Nobody is going to do this for you.  You have to approach if you want to get anywhere.  My game is natural, normal, boring, and a little sloppy, but 100% me.  I open people by having good body language, not approaching directly head-on, smiling (eyes are important) and saying ""Hi!""  Then I ask a question: How's you're night going?  Then I answer my own question, explaining to people what I'm doing.  One time I even explained that I had a really stressful day and just came by myself, because I wanted a drink (truth).  If they're not receptive, I ask a couple more boring questions: How long have you been here for?  Are you locals or visiting?  How are you liking this bar?  And do the same answer my own question thing, until they crack.  Sometimes they don't and I'll say, ""Well nice talking to you, I'm going to see who else is around.""  Then I make them regret being cold to me by brightening the lives of others in the bar.  Sometimes they'll even approach me later and initiate conversation after witnessing my outcome independence and giving attitude, because it's a bit uncommon and refreshing.  **GO OUT REGULARLY.**  Also, don't forget that you can game and approach while doing errands, while shopping, studying at a coffee shop, etc.

* **The process**:  Girls want the process of attraction.  Give it to them.  They know you want them naked, and they want you naked too, but they want the process.  Don't worry about approaching them, touching them, asking for their number, kissing them, and getting them to a sex location.  Unless they say otherwise, they are enjoying the ride.

* **Physical game**: This is probably half of seduction and one that is often overlooked.  Being in shape helps.  Good body language is very important.  Dancing is fun.  Leading through body language is important.  Knowing how, when, and where to touch is important.  The first type of touch should be cordial, fun, and friendly.  I personally like to touch while I'm at dramatic points of a story or at the punch line of a joke.  If she's smiling, and you touch her, and she's still smiling, you're doing something right.  Kino out of context is really creepy.  Vin Di Carlo's escalation ladder is really useful.

Grooming is what I believe to be a major cornerstone of seduction game.  **However, the ability to communicate in multiple venues (especially IM/Texting) will also give you a leg up on the competition.**  And yes, it is a competition.  Remember the saying *When going after a taken/married woman, you are only competing against one man.  When going after a single woman, you are competing against the world.*

Since I've been dividing my time between work and school, I have little time to get out in the field.  So I've kept an OkCupid account to augment any deficiencies in my contact pool.

Here's what happened last night:

After finishing my workout, I head home to watch the basketball game.  While watching the game, I check my OkCupid inbox.  Immediately an HB8 IMs me.

I might not agree with everything in here, why should I? it's not a cult; and if people were to take the time to read through, everyone would find useful information, knowledge, and actionable items that would bring them closer and closer to their goals; be they to have a ONS, or to maintain a great LTR/marriage (a LTR is a continued seduction).

For those who don't know me yet, I am older, at 50!  Yikes, I know. And I've been reading PUA'Seduction for over 10 years now, and I can attest that it works!  

Having said that, I am a bit puzzled by the general advice given by **some** gurus.  My left brain can't understand the math.  

If you go out to clubs on Saturday Night, and you score all the women that you say you score, how come you are back alone i those clubs on Saturday Night?  And every night?
You are not professing or stating that you only seek ONS, so, let's say that your AFC gets into the game today, at some point in time he's going to score a gf or FWB of some sort, and most of the time this girl will be free on Saturday Night, prime time for having fun.

Sure he could pull it off some excuse to not see her, but.... why?  Why would he risk that she'd go out with her girlfriends only to be picked up by another fellow PUA?  

Sure, once one gf is secured, some guy will think it's OK to go out there and find some other suitable women.  This is not the post to talk and debate when *exclusivity* starts, or if it's desirable/feasible.

So, once a girl is secured as someone to hang out, go out on Saturday Night, the PUA goes out, again, looking for more girls.  And he's successful, he now dates 2 women.  Without going into the logistics details, one gets Saturday Night, and the other one gest Sunday Night.

I don't know about you, but when I am in a relationship with someone, is because I like them; and even if it's at the beginning when we are not exclusive, we hang out at least one more day during the week.  So, 2 girls = 4 nights/week.

And, according to the PUA gurus, they still go out there, and you should too.

And this is where I start to get really puzzled, and here's why:

* I live near a Major US city, so there are many venues, but, let's face it, there are only a handful of cool venues where the beautiful people go, and where I like.  If I am already dating 2 women.... someone knows someone, the risk for disaster is too high.

* Traveling miles and miles.. what for?  I have (in this case) 2 girlfriends already, and busy 4 nights a week.

* Budget.  If I am going out 4 nights a week with the girls that I am dating AND I still go out for some more *game* another couple of nights, that makes it 6.  It's expensive!  I am doing fine financially, but... that would take a toll on my finances, on my health (too much drinking) and to my sleeping patterns)

This is what I practice, but not advocate since I am not a guru/expert:

* use /r/seduction as a way to be or become a *Confident Modern Male*

* have a social life.  Which means a large circle of friends

* be social: which means do activities that interest you and your friends, not just go to bar drinking and gaming

* being a *Confident Modern Male* people will be attracted to you. A subset of them will be eligible females that you will be attracted to as well

* get yourself a girlfriend

* still continue to be a *Confident Modern Male*

* still continue to be social, your life doesn't change because you have a girlfriend, she integrates into your life

* therefore other women will be attracted to you, at this point it is **your** decision, and your decision only on what to do.  You can have:

- multiple girlfriends, but realistically anything more than 2 is very hard to maintain, 3 hard in the long run, 4+.. if you are able to, please do post!

- constantly upgrading girlfriend, as soon as someone *better* comes along, whatever *better* means to you, out with the old, and welcome the new

- have a somewhat steady girlfriend, and a few Friends with whom you ALSO have sex (the FWB thing)

- any variation, permutation, combination of the above that works for you.

**BUT** if you are a good PUA, it makes no sense that every Saturday Night you are out there chasing.... #-close, k-close, f-close.

I've been getting a lot of numbers lately when I go out to bars or clubs or what have you, but when/if the girl responds varies considerably. I am sure there are whole forums on ""text message game"" but I think that the text you send a girl after meeting at a bar and maybe hooking up once can probably be distilled to ""not sexually suggestive"", ""sexually suggestive"", or ""a simple question"". So I created this simple study to measure how effective each is. Below is the outline for my study. I apologize if it sounds overly ""sciency""; My background is in technical writing so that is just how I write. Let me know what you think, but go easy on me. This thing was created in one sitting and hasn't really been polished. I look forward to your feedback!

**Study question**: What are the factors that influence return text time (RTT) in American female young adults?

**Background and Hypothesis**: The appearance of aloofness is highly sought after in heterosexual intergender social relationships. Attentiveness and eagerness is meta-perceived as overly attached, which is undesirable in a hedonistic sub culture that values a “no strings attached” approach to dating. Many young females appear to be especially weary of male attention that was initiated largely in nightlife* setting due to a media-imputed stereotype that men, in that context, are only interested in sex. This might very well be true and the impression may be positively reinforced if she has already initiated or accepted sexual advances with the man in question. Nevertheless, young females are typically willing to give their personal phone number to a soliciting male for several plausible reasons: 1) interest in initiating another interaction (sexual or non-sexual); 2) a perceived obligation to please the man, or; 3) the desire to expand her social network, something strongly encouraged by the culture. 

As it is not typical for young women to initiate a second interaction for the aforementioned socio-cultural reasons, the man will initiate, usually via text message. This study seeks to understand how long the woman will wait to respond once she becomes aware of said message: this is the return text time (RTT). Suspect factors that influence this decision are: 1) content of text message contextually interpreted by her present state, 2) quality of former interaction(s) with the suitor; 3) initial and present impressions of the suitor as a viable sexual partner. 

**Methodology**: The relative contributions of the three proposed variables to RTT can be parsed and assessed by controlling for two and gauging the deviation of third from some predetermined average text message response time for the population, defined as English speaking, American females ages 17 to 29. First, this would require an average response time to be calculated. Although there are a variety of confounding variables, a large data set will generate a robust population statistic from which deviations can be measured. The variables tested are inherently subjective which makes them less amenable to controlled experimentation; however, the former can be standardized more readily than the latter two. I propose to construct a protocol to assess variable (1) as an independent variable for RTT. 

The results must be interpreted in light of the other important variables mentioned as well as other lesser important, but not statistically negligible confounding factors. An endless variety of permutations on (1) can be created and RTT can be measured. The six variations to be used in this study are: 1) early week, “I enjoyed hanging out with you. We should do it again soon”; 2) mid week, “I enjoyed hanging out with you. We should do it again soon”; 3) late week or weekend “I enjoyed hanging out with you. We should do it again soon”; 4) mid week, “Heyy sexy! whats goin on??; 5) late week or weekend, “Heyy sexy you should come party w me”; 6) mid week, “Hey, can I ask you a question?”. 

Sub-variables 1-1 through 1-3 measure the efficacy of a text message that is not sexually suggestive with an element of intertemporal variation. Text messages should be sent at approximately the same time at the three points during the week to control for sub-intertemporal variation: arbitrarily, 4PM. Sub-variables 1-4 and 1-5 measure the efficacy of a text message with a strong element of sexual suggestiveness also with intertemporal variation. Finally, sub-variable 1-6 includes an interrogatory element that requires a simple response or no response. No particular context is given and therefore this sub-variable can also be used to indirectly assess variables (2) and (3). Presumably, if the woman responds, she was pleased with her former interaction with the suitor and is interested in reinitiating a dialogue. 

Measurement of RTT will be initiated when the text message is sent. After 24 hours with no response, a “No response” will be logged, which can be amended if necessary with the appropriate time. Follow up text messages should be constructed with the intent of initiating a second interaction. RTT to these follow ups should be recorded until a second interaction is accepted. Subsequent failure to initiate this encounter should be noted with data. RTT of the first response text message will be measured as function of the sub variables 1-1 through 1-6.

",251,42,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/kcedb/a_common_blindspot_to_success/,"This is a followup to [my post in this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/kae8j/getting_to_the_next_levelhow_do_you_guys_do_it/) Some people wanted more details so here they are. My last submition [""How I Rebuilt Myself""](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/k7y2h/how_i_rebuilt_myself/) got positive feedback, so if you like this, that might also be helpful.

The following is rarely talked about because it is hard to define, however often just being aware of it is a fix in itself. Personally this was a huge secret that was blocking me.

Symptoms
--------
*****
* You know pickup material, but you aren't getting women.
* You can open like a boss, but conversation never escalates
* You get numbers, but no solid day2's (this includes flakes)
* You don't know whether to invite a girl alone or to hang with bunch of friends
* You need to clarify whether a day2 is a date or ""just hanging out""
* You come here not knowing what to text or say to a girl

To clarify, what follows is not the only cause for these symptoms nor is it a ""magic pill"" solution. It is often a part of things, and a part that is not generally talked about in pickup material. This was the major difference for me before I was really successful. 

The Problem
-----------
*****
Guys have a ""worldview"" before pickup that they hold onto once learning PUA techniques. Things like: *""I don't often meet new women"", ""I don't normally take women home"", ""Women won't have sex  without being in a relationship""*. They hold onto this worldview when doing pickup, especially ""indirect game"" which compounds the problem by telling the reader to avoid showing interest in the woman.

The big problem comes when they try to change to a ""We are going to sleep together / date"" worldview, usually far too late in the interaction. It comes as a surprise to the girl and seems incongruant. If you ever felt like escalating was ""out of the blue"", this likely applies to you.


####First impressions:
Women start building an image of who you are, what your life is like and how they factor in your life from the moment they meet you. If they start building a ""friend / boyfriend"" image, any attempt to break out from that is difficult. If they start with a ""seducer / lover"" image, then everything is much easier as they already start imagining you together.

My next post will be ""Thinking like a Woman"", it will cover all the decisions she goes through to classify you and decide whether to sleep with you and/or date you, and how to build a successful image outside of attraction / comfort / kino and the traditional PUA material. 

The Solution
------------
*****
You need to adopt a PUA worldview (examples below) from the start, and keep it the entire interaction. This is not something you add in after you think she is interested or after you have her #. This is there from the start, so they know what to expect every step of the way. Here are some examples:

* I often meet women, and take them home. This is normal
* It is common to meet people and meet alone at a later date
* I am highly valuable and women fight for my time

You need to make it clear from the start that you know and let her know where the relationship is heading. You guide the entire process, so she isn't surprised and doesn't hold any ambiguities about where things are going.

####Indirect Game
You don't need to let her know that you are interested in **her**, but she still needs to know that it is normal for you to seduce women in your life. So if you do decide you like her, it is not a surprise or out of character for you to seduce her.  

Techniques
----------
*****
So how do we project this worldview?

###In conversation

* Getting her relationship status early on
* Guide conversation to relationships / sex / personal relationship histories
* Make comments implying you two will hookup, get into a relationship, heck get married, etc (all semi-joking)
* Disqualify yourself from relationships which indirectly implies still hooking up
* Stories about girls you've hooked up with, exciting ones

Make it clear from the outset where you think this interaction is heading. Tons of standard material apply.

###Sub-communication

* Kino (this is huge, just a hidden squeeze can communicate a lot)
* Not accepting any frames that don't lead to you hooking up with her

I could go into an entire post about frames, but basically this means if she throws out anything like *""You could be my friend"", ""We should go on a date where you spend money on me"", ""I don't hook up with strangers""*, then you don't accept those. That means being unreactive, treating it like she was joking, changing subject like you didn't hear it, or actually calling her out on what she said rather than let it slide. 

###Timebridging (proper #-close)
Handle every detail:

* When / How you are going to get in contact with her, how she should answer
* What you two will be doing together (Paint an image for her)
* What you expect and she should expect from the day2 (more than friendly conversation)
* Where the relationship is headed (above, should be covered before the day2)
* Get her to confirm with enthusiasm your day2 plans

This is huge, because guys will often get a # without doing ANY of this, and wonder why she doesn't pick up or flakes. You need to walk her through the entire mental process of deciding to go on a date with you. Tell her you are going to call her tomorrow at 6pm, and she better answer within 2 rings and say *""WOW curveball I am so happy to hear from you!""*. Tell her you are going to get icecream, talk about the fun conversation you will have and what will happen afterwards. Have her imagine walking with your arm around her licking icecream cones together, getting some on your nose, etc. Get her to agree to it! If she isn't 100% committed then tell her the plans are off.

***Secret Tip:*** Ask her if she *thinks* she would go out with you if you asked her on a date, before you ask her. Studies have shown once a person cast themselves in a role performing an action, then there is massive cognitive dissidence to later change their mind, because they'd have to re-evaluate their own choices. This can boost your date rate **immensely.**

####What if I don't have time or haven't isolated?
Same thing but abbreviated if you have to get her number quickly without locking her. Even if you are going to invite her and her friends to meet up with your group at a nightlife thing, you should still cover when you are going to contact her, what you guys will be doing together and have her agree to it.

1304897212.0,208,self.seduction,h6x0h,"Some basic tips I've realized that have made all the 
difference in my attitude and results",239,31,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/h6x0h/some_basic_tips_ive_realized_that_have_made_all/,"1. For the love of god, look people in the eyes and smile. I know this is pickup 101 here, i know you've read it a million times before. I know you are thinking ""well no shit, we all do that."" The thing about this is that people will be SO MUCH more receptive to you if you simply look them in the eyes and smile. It's funny because if you look people in the eyes and smile, they IMMEDIATELY become so much less intimidating, it's interesting how that works. This is a tip that can work with all people right away, your smile doesn't even have to be a GOOD one, but this is still something you should work on.

2. Once you've got eye contact down, use your eyes. Watch people while they talk. You will notice their facial expressions, their general mood, their movements, their clothing, any accessories, their hair or whatever. Examine everything, comment on it, joke or tease about it, ask about it, this is amazing for generating some comfort building conversation as well as some light teasing. If you just observe the person it gives the conversation so many directions to go. It can also be great for putting you in the mindset that YOU are the one judging HER, which is great for gaining the right mindset. So remember, observe the person and learn to comment on your observations. This can make all the difference.

3. I'm not sure how everybody here will feel about this one, but I would say as a general rule to try to avoid sarcasm. I know it's funny a lot of times but people whom you are just meeting generally are not very receptive to sarcasm. I would avoid it. (I would like feedback on this one, it's very much personal experience because I am a heavily instinctive sarcasm-user.)

4. Remember, girls are cute. This doesn't seem like much of a tip, I know. Obviously we're here because girls are cute, right? Wrong. A lot of us came here initially because girls were just the opposite. They were intimidating. Stop taking everything about the opposite sex so seriously, girls are adorable and it's fun to see how they'll react, so enjoy it and laugh it off. Have fun.

5. PICKUP IS NOT A LIFESTYLE, it's a hobby to supplement your lifestyle: I do not know how to stress this enough. We've all read the game, we've all been at that point where our expectations were way too high and we constantly compared ourselves to an unrealistic standard, and no matter how much progress we made it was never enough. Lifestyle changes like the ones promoted here take baby steps, sometimes very intimidating baby steps but do not push yourself to do too much at once. It's not necessary. It's OK to take baby steps.

Imagine for a moment that you go out with a good friend every saturday, and you play a game of basketball. Lets say that every week your friend absolutely stomps you into the ground, and you lose by a long-shot. You may be a little down that you lost, but once you step off that court you go back to your everyday life. You don't let the basketball game bleed into and taint every other area of your life. It's just a hobby. Pickup should be the same thing. don't let the outcome of your sets affect the rest of your life, your actions or self-esteem. Once you leave a set, you're back in everyday life and the two have no reason to intersect. So stop looking at picking up women as a detrimental part of your lifestyle, it only matters when you're in set, once you leave a set you go back to your life. I'd be happy to expand on this if i was no clear enough.

6. This is the most important one so I wanted to put it last. The reason I put this after number 5 is because it ties into it. For the longest time I though I wanted my lifestyle to be pickup. This is the worst way to go.

YOU CANNOT BE PROUD OF YOURSELF, OR HAVE ANY LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IF YOU ARE NOT PROUD OF YOUR LIFESTYLE. You have got to diversify, you cannot focus your entire life on pickup alone. Take a look at yourself. Now imagine your ideal self. I mean just physically, not mentally. Do you dress the way you want? Do you actually do the hobbies you like? Imagine your BEST self, the way you see it. What does he do? Are you doing that? Get out, go to the gym, get a job, surf, play guitar, go to concerts, dress whatever way you think is cool and fucking WEAR those clothes, accessorize, read more, take martial arts classes, it doesn't matter. Just start building your idea of a lifestyle you would be proud of and don't wait, do it now. You'll be amazed how much of a difference it would make.

I know this is a relatively vague peice of advice, but if you have no idea what your ideal lifestyle is then start taking cues from people you look up to. Emulate some of the things they do to see what you like or don't like. Whatever you do you have to diversify into as many areas as you can, the more things you do outside of pickup the less important pickup becomes in determing your own self-worth and the less intimidating it becomes. Not to mention it will become more fun, and effective.

EDIT: Something small I wanted to add. Remember that everybody is a pickup artists friend. Don't be afraid to talk comfortably with everybody you meet. Talk to them the way you'd talk to an old friend. Don't be uptight. Don't be afraid to be goofy.

tl;dr
Get out there and create a lifestyle for yourself as soon as possible, don't make your entire life about pickup. Make eye contact, smile and have fun. Remember, girls are cute, and fun to flirt with.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_h6x0h,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/h6x0h/some_basic_tips_ive_realized_that_have_made_all/,

I've learned a ton from reading everything you guys write, and while I have a long way to go before I'm up to the same caliber as people like TofuTofu and other legends on here, I have managed to carve out a niche for myself in college as a fairly successful ladies man.

What I'd like to discuss is two techniques I've been using to great effect in initiating sex. Now I will disclaim this by saying that I AM in college, so LMR probably isn't as big an issue as it is in other environments, still these two phrases have served me well.

""You're right, this is crazy.""
and
""Do I need to grab a condom?""

The first one I think I learned either on here or from reading Neil Strauss' books, maybe both. Said when a girl expresses some doubt as to how fast/far things are going, it does an amazing job facilitating things by showing that you get where she's coming from and are having just as wild and crazy a time as she is with things.

The second is something I've devised, and while it might not be amazingly ingenuitive, damn does it work. The way I use it is that after some heavy foreplay, once she's going down on me or otherwise very evidently turned on, I'll grab her face, give her a big kiss while pulling her into me, and simply ask. ""So am I going to need to grab a condom?"" So far, this has never not worked.

It shows her several things at once. You get where things are going and want to be safety conscious about it, and at the same time, broaches the subject of sex without directly saying ""OKAY LET'S FUCK NOW."" It allows her to commit to sex without feeling as slutty as she might otherwise.

Anyway the reason I'm posting this is twofold. I'd love to help just one person advance their game a bit, and if somebody learns something from this post, well, I'll feel pretty awesome.

1343178224.0,202,self.seduction,x3swf,I’m Eric Disco. I help nice guys get past their fear of approaching women. AMA,285,83,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x3swf/im_eric_disco_i_help_nice_guys_get_past_their/,"It seems like one of the simplest things. You're out getting a cup of coffee and you see her at the coffee shop. She's gorgeous. You're really attracted to her. So why not say hi? Strike up a conversation. If it doesn't go well, you've lost nothing. But for most guys-and certainly most Redditors-this can be one of the toughest things in the world. I include Redditors because it's typically the thoughtful, intellectual guys who have the most trouble with this.

Guys these days are in a difficult position. We're expected to make the first move to talk with her, to ask her out on a date, to be the one to go for the kiss, etc. At the same time, it seems completely unacceptable to hit on women and get sexual with them. A guy who is too bold and overt with his sexual interest in women is shamed and laughed at as a douchebag. Nobody wants to be ""that guy.""

As guys we're expected to suppress our emotions, to be brave and take action. But when you do take initiative to talk with a woman you don't know, you're suddenly dragged into deep emotional waters. Your body starts to react in ways completely unfamiliar to you. You come up with a million excuses why you shouldn't do it. You freeze up like a dear in headlights. And it's not cute like in romantic comedies where the guy trips over his words and the girl finds it charming. It's an overwhelming, paralyzing fear that grips you to the core. 

The first time we do it, these feelings can be so overwhelming and uncomfortable, it feels like our bodies can't contain it. We've never experienced something like this before, and we never want to again. So our natural instinct is avoidance. We stop trying to approach women. We stop improving ourselves socially. We become passive and hope one day the stars will align and that amazing woman will fall into our arms. We think that if we keep working on whatever else is passionate to us, she'll come along. 

When I first moved to New York City, I was floored by the number of attractive women I saw around town. But I couldn't speak with any of them. In 2006, I decided to take matters into my own hands and get coaching. There were plenty of people with excellent advice telling you what to say and do around women, but no one could tell me how to get past that fear. No one could tell me how to deal with this overwhelming paralysis or the self-torture that came with inevitable rejection. I was in uncharted emotional territory.

That's why I started, [ApproachAnxiety.com](http://ApproachAnxiety.com). I spent the next six years learning how to deal with these feelings, writing about it, and eventually coaching other guys to do it. Since then, I've had millions of readers and coached hundreds of guys.

I recently finished my first book, [She's Six Steps Away](http://ShesSixStepsAway.com  ). In it, I detail exactly how guys can take small, measured steps to get past their fear. A few key points:

* **It's not your fault.** The thoughts and feelings that arise when you try to take initiative are automatic and involuntary. You can't decide not to feel them. You can't get rid of them by thinking something in your mind. Stop trying. The only thing you can do is take small, measured actions toward your goal.

* **Trying to ""get this over with"" doesn't work.** Neither does setting yourself up to talk with ten women every day, or doing a thousand approaches. The way to get past your fear is by starting in the shallow end of the pool and getting comfortable there before moving into the deep waters. By starting with smaller social initiatives, like simply going out, standing next to women, saying something and walking away, you get your body comfortable with the uncertainty of social interactions.
 
* **There are fears and inhibitions at every stage.** Even if you can say something to a woman and walk away, you may still have fear staying in longer, getting personal, or being sexual with her. Instead, we can break 'the approach' down into smaller initiatives. You can practice each initiative and get comfortable with it before moving onto the next. Eventually you are able to do the whole thing: successfully start conversations with attractive women you don't know.


I'm here to tell you it is possible. I've taken many guys through my program and many more have found success through my book and website. Ask me anything!

Of course, your natural instinct is probably hit on her more. Talk to her. Do something. Make her notice you. But thats where you'd be wrong. 

The best thing to do in this situation is just go away. Go away. Go the fuck away. I know it can be hard, especially for beginners, to walk away from a girl that is (or was) interested in you, but as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder. 

Why does this work? Because there is nothing less exciting than a sure thing, and nothing anyone wants more than what they can't have. When you're interested in a girl and she knows it, it's easy for her to just take it for granted and lose interest. However, if all of a sudden you're gone (you don't have to be rude about it, ease away and do your own thing) she will realize that she no longer has what she once had. You've given her some cookies then taken them away, and damnit those were her cookies and she'll want them back.

(I initially posted this as a reaction to [this thread on proposing sex ridiculously early in the reaction](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1htiau/fr_decided_to_try_something_new_cant_believe_it/) by /u/seditman, but fuck it, it applies to other stories shared here. Do we have an influx of new users with the summer starting or an inbound link from a large sub or something?)

Many FRs - including the one linked to above - are not *at all* as un-realistic as y'all seem to think it is: note that the author only got a number and a make-out at that venue itself, and then later on went home with one of them. It's not like either girl just went down on him right there in the bathroom. 

**If meeting a person for the first time, shortly after making out with them, and then later that same night going home with them, has never happened to you**... (which is all that happens if you sit down and read that FR closely - also, I am being gender neutral on purpose, because I think for many girls these scenarios are not only more realistic, but also a common *romantic fantasy*)

**...that is ok.**

Welcome to seddit my friend! Have a look at the side bar, go out some more, and give stuff a shot even if your initial reaction is that it is not 'you', and thus can not be 'anybody', least of all a normal, well-adjusted non-creepy fellow human being. You are wrong. 

Interactions like those in the story have happened to me, and happened to many others on seddit, and it is **poison** and frankly impolite to dismiss them in the comments. 

If you want to believe and jokingly quip how all guys on reddit are sad little neckbeards never going out in the world, let alone speaking to women, let alone *getting along* with women and flirting with and seducing them, I know a perfect place for you. It is called *pretty much all the rest of reddit*.

Now here's the thing, **even if OP's interaction DID never happen, his post and the interaction in it are still valuable, and realistic.** 

Minus the specific gimmick in the linked post, i.e. saying that you want to have sex ridiculously early in the interaction - which is just one of many ways to demonstrate the attractive qualities of daring and adventure and lack of following social norms - picking up girls quickly happens countless times each day in clubs all over the world.

**Just something like OP's story didn't happen to *you*, or even to *him*, does not mean it is necessarily 'impossible'.** Stop thinking stuff is impossible. But above all, stop *saying* it which discourages both OP and fellow students of the art of seduction, and just leave.

**If I were a mod, I would just flat out remove all 'this did not happen' comments**, and - given that the mods here have some experience with girls and can thus be considered good judges - if a post *really* seems outrageously unrealistic, just delete the entire post itself.

Sorry for the rant. 

And yes, before you ask: I once (under another nick) myself posted my very first long and detailed FR hoping that my experiences would help others and curious for their take on it, and as the vast majority of the public comments were about how it never happened, I didn't bother writing any FR anymore since.

A beautiful gal. She's really great. We had been off and on for a little while with no visible hope of becoming a real long-term thing. When we were off, I told myself that I had ""one-itis"". When we were on, I told myself that it wasn't going to last because I deserved better.

Guess what guys? The perfect girl is *never* going to come along. Not fairytale, absolutely-flawless-perfect, anyway. ""She'd be perfect if she was X"" shouldn't ever come into play. Yes, yes, yes, try to push yourself into new boundaries and find new challenges &amp; more beautiful women to make your life great. Yes, try to improve yourself in social interactions, and yes, **try to find a girl that makes you happy.** Who cares about anyone else's picture of your #1 girl?

But once you find a girl that makes you truly, deeply, happy, and she wants a monogamous relationship? Game *her*. **You can keep your aloofness, keep your alpha male status, keep your outcome independence. Hell, keep your openers &amp; negs for that matter. These are just *social skills* that have been given a name.** Everyone who is on /r/seduction - or any other forum to do with seduction, for that matter - is just learning social skills. You are trying to take your social skills to the next level. Keep these social skills for everyone in your life. But don't look for K-closes or F-closes any more. Keep the #-closes. These people are now your friends. 

Funny thing I realized about social skills about a month ago - you don't learn them by reading about them. Once you've read enough, you've read enough. **If you want to climb further up the ladder, you climb outside Seddit, outside Reddit, outside the internet, outside books. The only people that can teach you how to be *true* masters of seduction are those who have mastered it without overthinking it** - people like Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, etc etc. Fuck, even Adrien Brody. That dude is not naturally blessed in the looks department, but he has that perfect movie-star demeanour. **Don't overthink anything.**

Don't look to be like those guys, **look to develop your own demeanour.** If you're a computer programmer, you want to be that sexy elusive thoughtful genius that doesn't talk too much, but always has something good to say. If you're a musician, develop your rockstar attitude. If you play sports... You're probably not here. Something about people who play sports just gets them laid. Don't say ""oh that's cause they play sports"".. fuck no. Sports taught them what they know about seduction. If you're someone who plays sports and is bad at picking up women, don't lose hope. It'll probably even be easier for you to learn what you're missing. Programming doesn't teach you shit about women. The point of any seduction forum is to help *you* find your own unique brand of self-confidence. If you're a programmer now, figure out what you need to learn to fill the gaps that a lack of sports created. This is just an example; this doesn't mean you have to stop being a programmer -

This means you have to **look at all the things that are wrong with you, all your insecurities, and confront them.** Actively seek them out. Ask yourself what you're worried about, what you're self-conscious about. And why. And then find out why someone who *isn't* worried about those things *doesn't* worry. Steal their attitude and use it as you please.

I used to be self-conscious about money (I grew up poor), but now I've realized that rather than being jealous of rich people, I've got to just learn how to make money from them.. Then I won't be poor any more. Same as the alphas. If I see a dude who gets girls, he's not an enemy. Fuck. He's a great guy to have around. Make friends with *him*, and you'll get more girls. You guys are gonna call it ""raising your social value"", but nah. **If a dude gets laid a lot, he's gonna teach you how to get laid just from letting you watch how he works. None of this is an act. Find out who you are, and project it. He's not acting.** 

[side note: don't ask him deep ""pickup"" questions about how he does it. That's weird, unless you know he's already involved in the community. Approach him like a normal dude. ""Man, how are you so good with women?"" If he knows how to explain it, he will. If he doesn't, just keep watching. Don't keep bugging him and nerding out about it. If he knows how to do it but can't explain it, it's always been easy to him. You've gotta learn to act like it's always been easy, so absorb that from him. But don't try to be him; apply it to your personality. **This is too complicated to explain. Just go out and do it.**]

So if you're worried about one-itis (by monogamous relationship) or settling for too little in a girl, don't try to keep pushing pickup. If you're happy with the woman you're with, and she wants you to be monogamous, make her happy. If you get out of a happy relationship for no reason other than the perceived ""one-itis"", you'll just spend the next while looking for the girl that she was. Don't say this is a lack of abundance - I know that I could go out on the subway and talk to ten girls and have a few numbers, maybe take one to bed. It's not about whether or not I *can* do something else - I know I can - it's about knowing what makes you happy and sticking with it. On the flipside, if you're unhappy that you *don't* have a girl, you have one-itis. Realize that once you're in a happy relationship (for both parties), one-itis doesn't exist. 

Most people in the community forget this. They miss the game, because they miss the self-improvement. **Keep the self-improvement, but ditch K-closing and F-closing anyone but your own girl.** Ditch the community when you feel you've outgrown it. **Those who have outgrown the community don't stick around to teach the people who don't get it. They're too busy going out getting laid.** You can't learn anything from a community full of speculating amateurs. All the guys who really know what they're doing don't have time for a place like this.



**tl;dr: This is too complicated to explain. Just go out and do it. Learn by watching the guys who are good, and the guys who are bad. Figure out the good things the good guys are doing, the bad things the bad guys are doing, and testing what works for you.**

1354518648.0,205,self.seduction,146uxn,[FR] Simple Strategy for Overcoming Approach Anxiety- Now I know why it's called The Game,250,45,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/146uxn/fr_simple_strategy_for_overcoming_approach/,"I am a college student. I am not too bad at talking to women but I have a lot of trouble with initiating interaction. If I can't initiate, then all my other skills are moot, so I am working on my approach. Friday night I went to a dance party (dark room, lots of grinding) and found myself crippled with AA. I was walking laps around the dance floor just to have something to do and to scope out prospective girls. Almost automatically I would leave every five minutes and just chill in the bathroom so as not to deal with my anxiety. 

After being stuck in this loop for 20-30 minutes, I decided to give myself a goal. I had to ask five different girls to dance that night. I was to give no thought to the outcome, only the number of attempts. This mindset was immensely transformative.

I asked an HB7 to dance, she said yes. We started grinding and about 15 seconds in, she launches away from me to go embrace a friend who just arrived. I brushed it off and was happy that my attempts score increased to 1. I took another bathroom break to pull myself together. I should have just moved on to the next girl, but I was happy enough at having worked up the courage to ask that girl to dance. 

I returned to the party and found a HB6, who turned me down. This did not bother me, my score just increased to 2. Shortly after I make an attempt with a HB7, who claims she has a boyfriend. No worries, I'm at 3/5. It was becoming a game to me. My goal was not ""fuck a HB10."" Baby steps... my goal was instead ""just make some attempts."" Every rejection only came after a success of having asked in the first place. That's two steps forward and one step back in my book. A net gain. 

Finally, I see a HB6, I ask her to dance, and she says sure. Immediately she was into me, holding my hands while grinding, a clear IOI since most girls just keep them at their hands at their sides. As we're getting our groove on, I twirled her in toward me and went for the kiss. We made out for a while and kept dancing. Eventually I asked her to come back to my place, but she said all of her friends were still at the party and that maybe she would later. I made sure to dance so her back is toward her friend group so she stops looking over at them/ telepathically communicating.

Throughout, we exchanges small talk and I stayed a little cocky but nice, poking fun playfully at her attachment to her friends. Eventually I again proposed we leave, this time she noticed most of her fiends had gone and one of them was also dancing with a guy, so she was ready. I took her back to my room and got to second base (I feel like a high schooler saying that). I obviously would have liked to go farther with her but going from pacing the floor like an anxiety-ridden lunatic to having a topless girl licking my abs is a major improvement. 

TL;DR- Turn approach into a game. Set a goal for yourself denoting how many girls you want to talk to. Don't worry about the success of each encounter, you gain more from overcoming AA than you lose from an awkward interaction. Without an approach, there is nothing.

They told me they new several women there, and since that particular bar was their second home, they'd have an easy night.

Initially I was mildly intimidated by the prospect of going to a bar with the intent of meeting women when my friends had such a clear advantage, but I went anyway.

When we got there, it was crowded to say the least. Attractive women were in abundance, the music was loud, and one of my buddies who is a bit of a player was giving me a bit of coaching - ""Just make eye contact, be friendly..."" etc. Which actually heightened my anxiety a bit.

We were standing in line at the bar, and I started looking more closely. There were a lot of men with desperation on their faces, a lot of women with lonely expressions looking for someone to notice them, and that's when it hit me: these are just people.

Taking in the bar scene as a whole can be overwhelming, but breaking it down it's filled with a lot of people feeling a lot like I did. I knew all it would take is mustering a little more confidence than the others to put me miles ahead.

As we're standing in line a HB9 cuts in front of me. I looked at my buddy and he just gave me a ""oh well"" look.

""Excuse me, did you just cut in front of me?""

""Yeah. I did. What are you going to do about it?"" she asked, looking me up and down.

""Nothing as long as you buy me a drink."" 

They had jars of beer going for $5.

""If you buy me a jar of PBR we'll call it even,"" I continued.

""I'm buying myself one.""

""Bullshit, you can't drink a big drink like that by yourself, you're not even 90 pounds.""

She smiled, and bought my buddy and I a beer and gave me a hug.


From that moment on I realized that all it took to stand out is to be a bit ballsier than anyone else. And I learned that any woman is approachable.

I was approaching 4 sets of women with ease. I didn't worry about the outcome or their opinion.

There's no F-close or K-close to this story, I didn't even get a number, but I danced with three different women, carried multiple conversations with incredibly attractive women, and most importantly went about my day today with a new outlook on life. Women respect a man who exhibits guts and will talk to them, and very few of them are as cruel and snobby as our fears lead us to believe. This realization helped me to talk to several girls around town today. Good stuff.

**Indicators of Interest and Disinterest** 

When women are interested or disinterested, they’ll give you signs to watch for called Indicators of Interest (IOI) and Indicators of Disinterest (IOD). There are verbal and non-verbal IOIs and IODs and may be active or passive.

***Active IOI Examples***

* She re-initiates conversations when you stop talking (So….)
* She giggles and/or laughs at your jokes, even if they’re not funny
* She touches you
* She tries to get rapport and build comfort with you
* If eye contact happens from a distance, she holds it for a second
* She holds eye contact for longer periods of time when she speaks with you
* She smiles at you
* While walking by, she turns her body toward you or brushes against you
* She uses a functional opener on you or in any way initiates a conversation
* She interrupts your conversation from nearby or laughs at something you said
* She asks for personal details about you (name, age, job) 
* She compliments you
* She is playful and tries to challenge you
* She's punching your arm but laughing
* She plays with her hair while talking to you
* She mentions your girlfriend without knowing if you actually have one
* When she has to go to the bathroom, she comes back
* She avoids mentioning her boyfriend
* When she says or does something, she looks at you to see your reaction
* She looks at you from the side, to hide the fact that she's looking
* She introduces you to friends
* She buys you a drink
* She calls you a player or a heart-breaker
* On her way out, she re-approaches you to tell you that she is leaving (Get her #)
* On your way out, she asks you where you are going (Invite her)
* She invents reasons to be near you, interact with you, or have Isolation with you
* She pushes up her breasts (sexual escalation)

***Passive IOI Examples***

* She stands nearby (proximity)
* Her friends leave and she stays
* She moves to see you and hangs with you for extended periods
* If you move she follows you or waits for you
* She doesn't flinch or pull back if you get close
* When your bodies touch in some way she doesn’t break the contact
* She doesn't resist when you escalate physically (or she gives token resistance to avoid feeling like a slut)


***The most important IOIs to look for are:***

* She giggles
* She touches you
* She re-initiates conversation when you stop talking

A special kind of IOI is an ***Approach Invitation***, which is simply a cue to approach. The most typical approach invitation is a smile with some coy looking away followed by more smiling. However, there are other more subtle Approach Invitations women may give you. 


***Typical IODs***

* Distance
* Closed body language (crossed arms)
* Not facing you
* Lack of interest in a topic; not investing
* Walking away
* Telling you to leave

When receiving IODs it’s important to mirror body language and give an equal or slightly less investment level yourself so avoid appearing needy until she begins to invest first.

In Phoenix, I had a female friend (that if we're talking numbers, easily a HB9.5) that moved out there not to long ago with her boyfriend, also a good friend of mine. Last Saturday we went out to celebrate one of her friend's birthday. We drive over to the birthday girl's house to get the night started. Lets just say that hot girls like to make friends with other hot girls. 

We arrive and it's a chill little two bedroom place with about 8 peeps. Birthday girl is married to husband dude. He's a really cool dude, we strike up a great conversation we all went to the same university. I find out from him that the ladies are either all married or have been in relationships forever. I say to myself, cool deal, just gonna have fun hanging with them tonight. I'm not the type of guy that dances in the *breaking-up-relationships* octagon. (Though I loved this [Audi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANhmS6QLd5Q&amp;feature=player_embedded) commercial.) 

We then hit up the bars and more lovely ladies join us, some are single. I do my thing. Meanwhile, my my the laides are getting hit on hard. That's to be expected, but rather than dive into specifics about each time and guy was put down very politely and moved on, there were two guys that well... didn't.

I'm chatting with one of the girl's husband just stort of standing behind the group of girls who were all buying each other drinks for the birthday gal and the next guy comes up. Oh god does the poor guy do it all wrong. 

The first guy comes up and starts Kino immediately with the B-day girl, to which she brushes his hand off right away. Then a second guy (dressed exactly the same as the first) comes in and pretty much does the same thing to another one of the girls.

These two guys were starting immediately with Kino, being very cocky, laughing loud, and came off as threatening. They were trying to physically move the girls one spot of the bar to the within the first few seconds of them all meeting. I couldn't hear what they were saying, but they were trying wedge their way into the group. One guy put his arm around another girl, and she was trying to remove his hand from around her waste. I see this then me and the husband are about to step in but then my long time HB9.5 friend comes in a just destroys both of the guys. 

She shoves both of them back. ""You need to fucking leave, leave my girl friends alone, GO!"" The one guy *still* tries to run game on her, ""I'm not fucking around..."" rather than backing off, the guy pushed and attempted to put his arm around her waist. Again. Well.. 

There goes the drink. 

At this point, they finally got the idea. They left socially shunned for the night. A good 20 people saw my friend play the drink tossing game. Oh my, that was funny. I hope they learned something. 

Afterward, I asked what had happend. One girl said ""He was grabbing me, and just all up in my space. He was being an asshole and a jerk. I don't give a fuck in you look good, he was a fucking asshole."" too which I replied ""Yeah, he got your drink too."" That lighten the mood. She went to get another drink. 

As she was, I chatted with the girls briefly about what those two guys said...

""He was just rude, I didn't know him, why the fuck would he put his hand around me like that?""
And another: 
""He said I have money... I don't fucking care if you have money"" 

**TL:DR**

So gentleman. Know how to acquire the knowledge of who's dating who, or who's married to who. Take a look at those left hands for that ring. Ask ""How do you guys know each other?"" or a variant of this question.

Introduce yourself to the guys of the group, they can help if you're cool, or at least tell you who's single or married. 

This: [Kino Escalation Ladder](http://www.seductiontuition.com/vin-dicarlo/dicarlo-escalation-ladder.html)

When a girl shoves you back and tells you to leave, take a step back and ease off, or get a drink to the face.

But that's all it is: a lie, a fake line to see how you respond to it, a screening device. And it typically comes out the more drunk she is, the more out of state you are etc.

This last weekend I approach a cute girl at a bar I regular and instantly her friend says: ""SHE'S NOT INTERESTED SHES MY GIRLFRIEND,"" in the typical screeching voice that the bitch shield comes out as (after a while you notice that many girls sound alike when they pull this). I look at her friend and I chuckle to myself: I had met the girl bitching at me earlier that month. Danced and kissed her and SHE had asked for my number.

This girl obviously did not remember me (she was very drunk when we met), but she had loved me the last time, yet she pulls the bitch shield hardcore. That's how I know the shield is a typically fake screening device.

I have experienced countless other examples. I open a girl saying I like her glowing necklace and BOOM a mother hen friend comes by and says,""SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU"". My brain laughs at these things, mentally thinking oh shut up she can handle herself, but outwards Ill always be polite and humble in my response. This typically disarms them and gives you a chance to re-engage.

Another example, I am standing near the opening entrance to my bar, on an elevated platform facing the crowd when a new girl enters the bar and stops next me to me. I open her discussing about how it's packed and observations about the flow of the bar. She turns to me and says ""You're creepy"". (Now, this is after I had made friends with at least 15 new girls over the last hour, so I know Im likeable). I turn to her and respond with something like, ""Oh im sorry if I have seem to given you the wrong vibe... (then rephrased my situational observations)"" She immediately becomes receptive and starts talking to me about video games. However I decide to leave anyways (other girls were more fun), and sure enough a minute later she passes and attempts to engage me again. And I was the creepy one.

My Last FR Ever?,252,50,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gc5q4/fr_making_hb9_my_girlfriend_for_12_hours_the/,"Hey Seddit. Long time no see. I’ve been avoiding the PUA scene for a while and running a more natural game. I’ve been on theory overload and I’m trying to drop all that shit. I know what works for me and what doesn’t, and I run more naturally now. I try to go out without any theory or pickup mentality in my head. I don’t need it anymore and my more “natural” game is working wonders. I may even leave the community for good soon.

With that said, this might be the last FR I write. But this one has some great stuff about shit tests, persistence, comfort, text game, confidence, and frame control. It’s long, but chock full of good information. Grab a beer and a snack, sit back, and enjoy.

My wingman (a total natural) and I picked up two girls at a bar the other night. My target was a hot little brunette. She was a very short girl, maybe 5’2”. Smoking hot body, perky tits, tight ass. This girl couldn’t have weighed more than 105 lbs. She was a solid 9 and maybe even one of the hottest girls I’ve hooked up with. She didn’t look like a slut either, or at least she didn’t dress like one. Her friend was… meh. That’s what wingmen are for.

I opened the set by playfully accusing HB9 of stealing my seat at the bar. After playfully arguing about whose seat it really is, she offers to buy us shots because she “feels bad” for stealing my seat. We happily accept her peace offering. It turns out these girls aren’t from the city and they live about 2000 miles away and are here for a few days on business. They’re young working professionals (26 years old) are I’m pretty sure these girls have some serious cash flow. These are some high quality bitches.

We end up hanging out with them for a while playing beer pong and chatting. At one point HB9 mentions how small and light she is, so I take it upon myself to pick her up and toss her around a little bit. She loves it.

We offer to take the girls back to my wingman’s apartment to go drink some beers on the roof and look at the city skyline (bitches love city skylines). Just a friendly invitation. “We’re going to Wingman’s place to drink a couple beers on the roof and check out the skyline. You guys can join us if you’d like.” You need to frame these things as if you were going anyway (which we were), and if they’d like join in on a little bit of fun they’re welcome to come. After a short “girl talk”, they accept and join us on our walk over there. 

During the walk my target stops on the sidewalk and is getting second thoughts about coming. “I think I want to go back to the hotel”, she says. I know she’s just throwing up a little bit of token resistance, as she doesn’t want to seem too easy. This is where most chumps will try to convince her with logic, but I refuse to fall into her frame. I turn around and tell her “you don’t have to come if you don’t want to” and continue walking with my wingman and the other girl. She yells back at me “Why are you being an asshole?” I’m smarter than that, and I know this is a huge shit test. I turn around and walk back to her and say “I’m not being an asshole. I want to have some fun on my buddy’s roof, and if you don’t want to come that’s totally cool. Nobody is forcing you. But it’s cold out here so lets go” while I put my arm out for her. She locks her arm around mine, and we walk arm in arm to the apartment. Winning.

This is important. You have to show the girl you’re willing to walk away. And I really was. I reinforced the frame that I’m out to have a good time, with or without her. And it would be her loss if she didn’t join us. I didn’t state this directly, but it’s implied and she picked up on it. I’m not going to stick around and beg her to come with us like some pussy bitchboy. 

Up on the roof, we isolate the girls. I’m kinoing like a boss, standing behind her with my arms around her to “keep her warm”, almost like she’s using me as a jacket. We’re talking quietly, and whenever I say something to her I put my lips right up to her ears and so they “accidentally” touch. She asks me “Why don’t you have a girlfriend? You can have any girl you want”. I explain to her that while I can get any girl I want (if she passes you the ball on that one, you gotta run with it), I don’t need a girlfriend. 2 years ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years, so I’m in no rush to hop into another relationship. I’m focusing on my new career, and although I’m not opposed to having a girlfriend (if a good one comes along) I can’t really be tied down to one girl at this point because I can’t commit. She agrees with me. We were being honest with each other and opening up a little bit about our personal lives. This is what you Mystery Method-ers would call the Comfort Stage.

My wingman and his girl eventually bounce into his room, and I take HB9 to the living room. I pick her up and toss her onto the couch. She’s laughing and loving it. We play fight a little bit and I spank her ass a few times. I can tell she’s turned on, so I go in for the kiss but she gives me the cheek and I get denied. (right? I was thinking the same thing you are. It was supposed to be a done deal!). So I pick her up again and throw her onto the other couch. I head to the computer to put on some music.

Music is a great way to bond with somebody. While browsing through the different artists we’re commenting on whether or not we hate them or love them. If I say I love a certain artist and she says she hates it, I playfully call her an idiot. She starts doing the same thing to me. We finally agree on something and dance together. After a couple songs, I pull her close and go in for another kiss. I get the cheek again, just some more token resistance. So I pick her up again and throw her on the couch. I jump on top of her and play fight some more.

It’s now about 4:00 in the morning, and her friend comes into the living room and says “we need to get back to the hotel.” They have work to do in the morning, and I have work as well. HB9 replies “I’m going to stay here for a bit with Delightful_White.” Music to my ears! Her friend leaves and as soon as the door shuts she lays down on the couch with her head on my lap and just looks into my eyes. I go in for kiss attempt #3 and land it perfectly. 

It’s all about persistence here. Chumps get all butthurt about getting denied a kiss. Like it’s the end of the world if she doesn’t kiss you back. OH THE HUMANITY!! Fuck that, not me. I act like it’s nothing and move on with the interaction. I’ll even attempt to kiss them a few more times. Don’t be a baby about it. NOTHING IS EVER A BIG DEAL. Sometimes getting denied a kiss just means “not now”.

We hooked up for a little bit, more play fighting and ass spanking, some more dancing. Next thing I know it’s about 5:00am and I have to get home because I have work in a few hours. We agree that it’s late and we both have shit to do so we make plans for Thursday night (her last night here). We head outside and I hailed her a cab and kissed her goodnight.

**Thursday Text Game:**

Me: We’re still on for tonight, right?

Her: I don’t know. I think me and [friend] are going to call it an early night. We have to travel tomorrow.

Me: Don’t be such a wet blanket. I’ll have you back before your curfew.

**PERSISTENCE!**

Her: I’m so tired.

Me: Haha you wimp. I find it adorable that you can’t handle the city.

Her: Says the guy who isn’t [doing her work things].

Me: All that work must make you thirsty. For 1 drink.

**PERSISTENCE!**

Her: You’re awfully pushy. OK. Me and [friend] will meet you for one drink. Where and what time?

Me: I’m persistent. Pushy is such an ugly word. [Bar] at 9pm.

**PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF**

I called up my wingman and he wasn’t up for it. I had to convince him to meet us there and he eventually agreed to help me out. This dude is the greatest wingman of all time.

On my way there, she sent me a text message saying they had arrived and where they were sitting. Once I got there, I headed straight to the bar to grab a drink. I scope the bar out a little bit while trying to find these girls and trying to not look creepy and maybe find other people that I know. I spot the girls on a couch in the corner, so I head over and take a seat across from them. Not optimal positioning, but I work with it and include both girls in on the conversation while we wait for my wingman. When the friend gets up to go to the bathroom, I take that as my opportunity to sit next to HB9 and start escalating physically.

When he finally shows up, I order a round of shots for everybody. I ask HB9 to help me carry them from the bar to the table. She says “No, you carry them” and I playfully reply “Thanks!” and look over to her friend and ask her “Can you please help me?” She says OK and gets up to help me when all of a sudden HB9 grabs her leg and pulls her back down and says “No, I’ll help!”

Again, don’t fall for the shit tests. Just ignore them. I find ignoring shit tests is the best way to pass them in most cases. Agree and amplify is also great, but I find deflection and ignoring works best for me.

We bring the shots back to the table and the party begins. We’re laughing having a good time, sharing stories, the drinks are flowing, and I got my arm around an amazing girl. I lift my glass to my wingman and he lifts his to me. We laugh. Life is good. (so much for “1 drink”)

1307466556.0,197,self.seduction,htver,"What a week: 2 F-close for 40-something divorced dad. Thanks, seddit!",237,40,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/htver/what_a_week_2_fclose_for_40something_divorced_dad/,"Warning: this is not sarging at the clubs, grinding on chicks, blowjob in the bathroom kind of post. But I think it is representative of what I must deal with. The thrill of the chase is the same, just different logistical hurdles. Also, it’s long. 

 I'm in my early 40's, divorced after nearly 20 years, coming out of a 2 year relationship with a smoking hot girl 13 years my junior.  I realized after that breakup that I had not ever really made a conscious effort to date before settling down too easily in a LTR, very little experience with pickup, etc. 

Last Friday night I stopped by a local dive that has good blues . Walked in and saw it was more folks my age than college age. Don't get me wrong, I love younger women, too, but it's just easier for me to pull a woman my age, and I wasn't in the mood for a lot of work. 

There were a few decent targets around, some would require dealing with friends or guys hanging around with them. Then I saw a two girls further down the bar, one of which caught my eye. Here's where my lurking on seddit helped. In the past I may have agonized before finally working up my nerve to approach, or I may have just frozen and not even tried. Instead I thought ""Fuck that. Go for it right now"" and did not allow myself to hesitate. 

Nothing dramatic to report, other than I walked over and introduced myself, used the old ""you really should calm down a little, I think you're having too much fun and the barstaff will cut you off"". She laughed, said she'd rather be dancing, so I took her hand and led her to the dancefloor. Instant obvious attraction on her part.  Several dances later I got her number, the suggested my place. She was ready to go. Effortless F-close, and she’s happy to come over any time I call now. 

I learned the following from seddit and applied: 
-Just approach already, quit analyzing it. BTW, she told me she hoped I would talk to her when I walked in, and within 5 minutes of meeting me knew she would go home with me if I asked her to. This was no barfly: she was on a rare night out after a LTR breakup. 
-Having an opener is helpful, something you can get the conversation going with. 
-Get physical as soon as possible. Dancing is good for this, but continue while in conversation at the bar, etc. 
-Don't buy drinks. I had switched to water at this point, and didn't offer to buy her or her drunk friend a drink. She later told me she was surprised, most guys start with that. 
She was an awesome dry spell breaker, but definitely not any kind of long term material. 

Second success to report is a really weird situation. A close friend from high school and college, not so much in recent years, died last year. His widow is a girl I knew from high school. My ex-wife and I used to go to parties and their house and vice-versa. For a while they were the couple we would get together with to go out, etc. but that faded over time as we drifted to different interests. I always thought she was hot and enjoyed her company. In other words, the good news is we already know each other. The bad news is there might as well be the ghost of her dead husband in the room with us. 

Of the women I had been in contact with, she was the one that I was most hesitant about. I had no idea what her emotional state was after losing her husband, and didn't know how creepy it would be to suddenly ask her out. We exchanged a few facebook messages, keeping it very light. I suggested we go to lunch one day or drinks one evening. She liked the idea, but didn't sound very eager. I needed a way to build some comfort. 

My solution was pretty solid for my particular situation (divorced dad of 3 interested in widowed mom of 3): I invited her to bring her kids and join me and my kids on tubing on a river on Memorial Day. It went very well, we had a little time to, but mostly it was just floating and drinking beers trying not to lose track of the kids.  I suggested we find a time for drinks and adult conversation without ""mommy mommy"" every 13 seconds. She liked the idea, but I had to work around an insane baseball schedule for her kids. ""Tuesday night after 9"" was her only opening. 

We went out the next night for drinks, had some good conversation, and moved to her house at my suggestion. We just sat with our feet in the pool, drank a few more beers, and talked until 2AM. She was sitting very close, and I initiated some very light, incidental kino, but was still pretty leery of really going for it. I was having a tough time getting a read on her emotional state. Since we go back a ways, I hated to risk pushing too much too soon and damaging the friendship. On the other hand, she was obviously attracted to me to some extent, and I figured she had to be getting the itch after so long with no man at all in her life. It was confusing, so I erred on the side of caution. 

A few nights later, on a Friday, we went out for real as in babysitter for kids, pick her up at her house, etc. Except her sitter cancelled at the last minute, so my oldest daughter stepped in. Like I said, kind of an odd situation. She drove and paid for drinks and snacks at our first stop (I happened to grab the tab on our first meeting. I thought that was a classy move on her part to insist on getting that one. Hell, she even insisted on paying my daughter to babysit, so you could say I made a slight profit on the date). 

We hit a couple of places, a piano bar, another bar with a band. Nothing big there, but I really started ramping up the kino, still making it seem incidental. I would touch her knee or arm while talking at the bar, took her hand to examine it for some excuse, pretended to brush something off her cheek, just routine excuses to touch her. When we walked between bars I grabbed her hand to move through the crowd, put my hand on her back to lead her to a seat, etc. Eventually it just felt natural for her to hold on to my arm while walking or sit with our legs and shoulders touching. This all sounds elementary I'm sure, but in the past I would have been nervous about pushing the physical contact for fear of not seeming like a ""nice guy"". 

Bottom line here is we went back to my place. I told her I had a little herb stashed if she was interested. She didn't have much experience, but was intrigued so we smoked a little. I had the stage basically set with music playing, a dark room. I hesitated, looked directly at her and held the stare, she just stared back. It was like a challenge: what are you going to do now. I felt that familiar anxiety setting in. I can think of several situations in the past when I let something as obvious as this get away because I was scared to escalate too soon. 

So didn't say anything, just went for the kiss. She responded enthusiastically, and we spent the rest of the night in my bed. Let me tell you: a sexually charged woman who has gone months with no sex at all is like a roller coaster ride. It was amazing. 

What I learned on this one:
-A neutral, kid friendly activity is a good icebreaker in a situation like this when she has kids and a lot of anxiety about dating: husband died in this case, but the same would go for recent divorce, etc. Take the pressure off in a setting where you can still build some rapport and comfort.
-Even if you're concerned about emotional state, etc. you still have to give the kino a try. Starting slow and continuing to ramp up without being gropy works fine. 
-When the time seems right, just go for it. You have to just use intuition, but I would have felt like an idiot if I hadn't taken her to my house and made a move. Hell, she wore her Victoria Secret panties. She was ready, I just didn't know it. 
-The herb worked well in this situation because it was a novelty, especially for her, and it gave her an excuse to lower her inhibitions totally. If she felt bad about it later she could blame her actions on being a little drunk and high. As it turned out, she really did lose ALL of her inhibitions, but this isn't that kind of FR. 

Sorry this FR isn't full of HB this and HB that and lots of PUA lingo. For what it matters, the bar pickup girl was about a 5 or 6 for me. The merry widow is a good 7 with an 8 body for a 37 year old. For both of these women, going from first kiss to having sex was literally minutes. It's probably an age thing, but once they had made up their mind, there was no hesitation or LMR. We're not dealing with college sophomores here. 

Also, for some mysterious reason, just having that week of success has inexplicably raised my mojo where it seemed dead before: sudden interest from some younger, hotter women I had talked to before. 

The result is that I feel much more confident in my ability to approach a woman, build confidence, and close the deal. Of course it gets more difficult when not dealing with 30 or 40 year old single moms, but I am by not means limited to those women. I open younger women all the time, and I'm still slowly working a couple under 30's that may turn into something. Confidence is key! If I maintain the attitude that I'm the prize and they are lucky to be talking to me, I have way more interest than if I'm supplicating, buying them drinks, being too available, etc etc. I learned that lesson the hard way.

TL; DR: Basic PUA principles work just fine for 40 year old divorced dads. Be bold, build attraction, then go for it.

I turn 30 years old next month. I married a firm HB9 two years ago, but I still read this forum because I find it wildly entertaining.

As a guy who had some luck in college in my younger years, I wanted to give some advice that seemed to always work for me.

In hindsight, whenever I wanted to get it in with a particular girl, telling her I ""liked her"" and that I wanted to be more than just friends inevitably RUINED any chance I had with her. I could tell it was a huge turn-off. IMO, when you do this, you are putting the next move squarely on the girl. Girls don't want to be in control - they want you to take the initiative.

If I liked a girl - going straight to kino and kissing always works better.

Talk is cheap - actions speak louder than words. Cheers!

I have recently become extremely confident for quite a few different reasons (losing weight, new clothes, good job and just learning how to be a happy content person all the time) 

I am very good at eye contact and kino because I have learned to be comfortable around women and realized that touching them is OK and actually fun. Unlike what I used to think, which was be respectful and don't touch women. 

I am not saying that I don't have to talk to women at all but I have been getting K and F closes easily with out telling crazy stories all the time and asking her a million questions. I make constant steady eye contact when ever I am near her or she is talking. I will softly grab her arm at the wrist and gently pull it towards me then let go when i see fit. Perhaps I break eye contact for a while, while I think to my self or talk to someone else. 

I let her go talk to other guys in the bar and I will then talk to my friends or someone next to me and she will usually keep looking at me and I will catch her glances. Every girl has come back to talk to me on her own accord after maybe 10 mins talking to someone else. 

Basically I try to maintain amazing posture, body language, eye contact and kino. I am not saying I don't have to say anything because I do talk and make her laugh but I just dont blab on and on.

1365262424.0,201,self.seduction,1bss0y,[FR]: early 20's female- went out to a pub crawl. First night out since committing to bettering myself and social interactions through seduction techniques,296,95,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1bss0y/fr_early_20s_female_went_out_to_a_pub_crawl_first/,"By high demand, here is my first field report. Had to make a new throwaway because I think this gives some identifying details. Important things to know--I just discovered Reddit a month ago and this subreddit last week. Apologies if this sounds like I'm writing in my diary or something, but I will try to use as many terms as possible. First night out since committing to making a real effort to changing my social interactions.

I'm a female, 24, American living in a non-English speaking country and have been here almost a year. Was invited to a pub crawl last night and I really jump on these events because it means a lot of English speakers in one place. Making friends is hard because I don't work with anyone under age 40, and often by the end of my work week I just want to be in bed by 8pm. I'm also an introvert, meaning that while extroverts recharge their energy by socializing, it makes me feel drained, and I need to retreat by myself shortly after.

**Goals:**My goals were to have fun, be in the moment and pay attention to people rather than letting my mind wander. I had no plans to hook up with anyone. I also wanted to experiment with how changing how I'd normally dress on a night out, my posture and body language to increase approachability and being comfortable with guys I didn't know paying attention to me in such a setting.

**Outer game:** I know the most important thing for a girl is to look as hot as possible. I don't usually do this because I don't want attention. But last night I wore heels and a short dress.

**Inner game:**Leaving my house, two things happened- I IMMEDIATELY regretted my choice of outfit and wanted to run back and put on some jeans and flats. It was light out and everyone was staring at me and glancing. Now was not the time to practice the eye contact with strangers thing that was on my mental check list, lest people would assume I was a prostitute. In about a 45 min commute by public transportation, I had three different cat-calls from creepers. I mean like, homeless men and taxi drivers. Secondly, I started reading a really good book on the bus. Nerd alert. I really wanted to go home and keep reading instead of going out. 
**What I learned:** Don't let anything ruffle my feathers so I don't get into a negative mindset before even arriving. If I dress like this, everyone will notice and some guys will say inappropriate things because I am attractive. Either accept that or don't. As an introvert, I really have to commit to a social mindset for the night if that's what I want to do.

Arrived at the pub, met up with my friends, the Australian, Argentinean and the Spaniard. We sit down and chat. Spaniard and Australian are dating. Argentinean is way too old for me, but I noticed when I first sat down the guys totally sized me up. Again, everyone is reacting really severely to how I dress. I don't know if I'm up for a few more hours of this.
Randomly, my old friend the American shows up. Haven't seen this guy in a few months, he's kind of a tool. He's alone so I ask him to hang out with us. He confidently introduces himself to my friends and chats with the Australian for a minute. I can tell that if anyone, he's the sort of guy that probably downloaded a study guide for the book The Game. And yet he still can't get laid... anyway, he's a nice enough guy, and who I end up spending the majority of the night with.

Time's up at this pub and we head to the next. American's friend, Moroccan shows up. Before he arrived, American told me this guy only has a dumb-phone because he lost three iPhones in 3 months, so he doesn't have GPS and was getting lost. The pub is crowded. 

American goes and buys drinks for the three of us and I sit with just Moroccan, talking to him about my solo trip to Morocco. Idk if that was received as DHV or I was just being interested in the person and trying to connect. Then he pulls out his $20 flip phone and I say, *""American tells me you were not very responsible with your iPhones...""* in my head I am thinking *oh! oh! I just did a neg!!!""* The look on his face was interesting. A mix of embarrassment and intrigue almost. Not sure why. He tells me how he lost them partying. I say, *""Yeah, holding our liquor and having smart phones...two things that are adults-only""* He says *""Adults only, huh?""* I ignore the sexual innuendo and just *giggle giggle*, I don't want to go there with this guy.
**Lesson learned:** Do more neg's. First ever. Was surprised at how it shifts the dynamic immediately.

Times up and we all move to the next pub. I go back to the girls for a while, really listening and engaging. A Dutch girl is being really loud and annoying. She's absolutely beautiful, but how she's acting is really unattractive and people around her look uncomfortable.
**Reminder:**Regardless of appearance, if I get too drunk, no one will want to hang out with me. Well, except guys who want easy easy sex, that is. Don't get too drunk, ever...

As the night goes on, the atmosphere is less pub-y and more club-y. American comes back and hands me a drink. Didn't ask for this at all. I just accept it, thank him and we talk more about life, what we miss about the states and buying a car eventually in this country. He says he wants to stay here permanently. I do not, but I leave any negativity out of the conversation.

Throughout the night, several guys approach me, but I don't really engage. I am really not interested in meeting new guys (only new girls because I want to make friends here). One guy comes up and just says,*""You're beautiful""* I say ""thank you"" but continue talking to Australian.
**Lesson learned:** When I have female-game, I am such a different person.

American comes back and hands me another drink. He says he and Moroccan are heading to a club after this and asks me to come. I say it's too far to walk in heels, so he gets us a cab. At this point, it clicks that American is trying to get with me, but doing a bad job. He's chatty, but he's too eager to pay for everything for me. It's really nice, and appreciated, but it's so... I don't know. Makes me think he doesn't commend any respect even though he's a physically attractive guy with a career much more successful than mine. The funny thing is, he probably has one more zero in his annual income than I do and has a masters when I only have a bachelor's.
**Lesson learned:** We all determine our own value and our behavior lets other people know what that is.

Moroccan, American and I get in a cab. I'm in the middle and really drunk right now (but not so drunk I have no brain). American and I start yelling/debating about politics.
**Lesson learned:**Talking about politics was bad because it got kind of heated and excluded Moroccan, which I didn't really want to do because I was in friends mode (even if I was with two guys, and even if they weren't). Drink less, or game deteriorates quickly!

We get to club. American checks my coat and buys me another drink. The weird thing is, he hasn't said anything flirty. I CANNOT read him. I don't really care, but I can't read him. We sit down on the couch. I kind of want to dance, but I have danced with Moroccan before and he is WAAYY too sexual too quickly, and I don't want to dance with American because I am afraid he will make a move. I know the last bus to my house is leaving in about 25 minutes, but I just don't want to be with these guys anymore. I tell them I'm going to head out. They don't seem to mind. Looks like we're all just really drunk. American walks me out to the tram stop. We do the gesture in this country that is equivalent to hugging a friend goodbye. I get on the tram.

I'm not sure what else I should take away from this and learn from. I had a good night. What's more interesting is that I'm going out again tonight in a city nearby that is on a very steep hill and I will NOT be wearing heels, I'll wear some brown leather boots. It will be interesting to note and compare the difference. So there it is. Over all, not a bad night for a first experience. Feedback is appreciated!

All had nearly exact personality types, did the exact same things on dates, and said nearly exact same things on dates. 

These were my first go at PUA techniques and obviously I need practice - I failed to escalate and my kino was weak, but improved each date. These girls were boring! It was almost like pulling teeth. I was surprised because I had great rapport with them through texting/messaging before hand so it was really a shock when we met up and all of them pulled the same game:

1) As soon as we met they would act distant, wouldn't look me in the face, would barely say a word, and kept physical distance from me and gave really cold body language. I reacted by trying to engage them, but this just gave the feel I was chasing them. There were some IOIs, but I just couldn't get them to leave their shell to emotionally connect with me. I know I need to kino right away, but I couldn't figure out how to do it without being awkward. They put actual physical distance between us that I would need to pull them in to make it possible to kino. Of course the pulling in would be kino, but that was exactly what I couldn't figure out how to do smoothly.

2) They all had this air of negativity. Mentioned they didnt like physical touch in certain situations: massage (wtf?!?), the feeling of jewelry...And just generally gave off a vibe of don't touch me.

There were several moments in the night that instead of trying to force conversation,  I just looked into her eyes and smiled.  And she smiled back and I could sense that both of us were getting more and more attracted to each other.  I think this is a huge key to building attraction.  I think that it definitely says something about you when you can be comfortable in silence.  It makes you look extremely comfortable in your own skin.  So don't be afraid that you'll run out of things to say.  If the topic dies, use it to your advantage.  Don't panic.  Don't result to survey questions.

Emotions were running through my mind as the replay of our night together echoed in my mind. I knew that my social skills got me to this place but I was not sure how to make her my girlfriend. I knew that I wanted to go from dating to a committed relationship but how do you do that?  
The process of learning how to make a girl your girlfriend was a painful one for me and so I hope that through this article you save yourself the mistakes that I made. 


The first thing that you MUST understand about making a girl your girlfriend is that love never dies of starvation, but often of indigestion. When we find something we like we often hold on to it so tight that it dies in our hands. We see this principal played out all the time in our lives when we spend too much time with some we end up getting annoyed with them and find someone else to be around for awhile. Think of this principal another way…

**.. Familiarity breeds contempt. **

The last thing that you want to do is suffocate your potential girlfriend with too much of you. Space things out and relax. 

**Tip #1: Space out the time you see her. **

If you want her to be your girlfriend you have to allow her to space to miss you. I know that every fiber of your being is saying something different and your heart is yelling at you to call her and see her but you have to allow some space between you two or you will suffocate each other before you know it. This is why I often suggest that you see each other once or twice a week. If you are spending 5 days together you are going to breed contempt at a much quicker pace because you have not allowed the emotions to calm down a bit. 


**Tip #2: Stop trying to “game” her. **

I cannot emphasize enough how important this tip is. Guys who learn some social skills never shut off there “game” and they try to hold her attention with gifts, texts and anything they can do to look good.  You must stop treating her as something you want to “accomplish” and start being a human being around her. It’s ok to mess up, show affection, show emotions and loosen up a bit. 


**She isn’t a game guys, she’s a girl. **

If you continue to “game” her she is going to get the feeling she is getting played and walk at some point. Believe me when I say that I have screwed this up so many times. You have to have the ability to be vulnerable because opening up and sharing is where love is formed. 


**Tip #3: Get a life.**

If you drop your life to be with her she won’t respect you in the long run. Hopefully you had a life before her and you should have one while you are with her. Many times guys will ditch their friends and lives just to spend more time with their crush but all the while they are doing more harm than good. This goes back to a post I wrote on scarcity vs. abundance.(http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/exd7y/scarcity_vs_abundance_how_neediness_kills_your/) If you have no other social options in your life then your neediness will kill every positive gain that you get.  
You MUST man up and overcome your longing to spend every minute with her. Allow her to know what it’s like when you’re not there and give her space to clear her head. When you allow her space you are respecting her and this grows the connection between you two. 


**More Thoughts…**

The more you play the game the less likely you are to win. 
Ever sit down to play games at a casino? If you win but continue to play over time you are bound to lose. If this girl likes you and you continue to play the game then you are bound to lose. People want to feel connected to their partners. They don’t want to feel they are the object of some game but they want to feel like there is another person who connects with them and values them. Being a social robot is about shutting off all emotions that make us human and if you do this you will never keep the girl that you want. 

At the end of the day she doesn’t belong to you and you don’t belong to her. Only she makes the decision to be with you or not and only you can make that decision for yourself. If you shut yourself off and live in a world where you are going to try to “get” this girl then you are setting yourself up for failure. 

Give her space, allow her freedom to make decisions and continue having fun. Pretty soon she is going to open up and give you hints about being exclusive. I often say that a guy tends to decide when the relationship happens and the woman decides when sex happens. Be a man and allow her room to grow or you will destroy the very thing you want to create. 

All the best,

Mayson

He is so spot on about how men should aspire to live their lives, it’s not even funny. This guy has game on a totally different level. He really taught us about what it means to be a passionate guy, through his words AND his behavior, and why that is so valuable for us guys who want to get better with women. I took like 7 pages of notes based on what he said alone. I would want to check out the DVD’s just to watch this guy speak, freakin’ awesome...

1372588213.0,193,self.seduction,1hcy5d,The shy guy's guide to approach-free pick-up,261,68,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1hcy5d/the_shy_guys_guide_to_approachfree_pickup/,"Around /r/seduction and the pick-up community in general, there is a widespread belief that online and text game are inefficient for any of the following reasons:

It is difficult to build rapport

It is difficult to build attraction

It is impossible to escalate

There are other reasons that online game might be frowned upon (it doesn’t build social skills like approaching does), but I’ll be addressing these, because they concern online game’s efficiency. In this post I’ll argue that these claims are false and that online game can be great not only for arranging dates but also for raising buying temperature.

Firstly, a bit of info about me. I’m a twenty-one year old student in a major Canadian city. I’m white, 5’10”, bald, and a little overweight. Last summer I was a virgin and had never dated. I’ve always disliked clubs, and I’ve never been good at approaching women in a club or bar setting. When I returned to school last September, I signed up to OkCupid.com. I’ve since slept with over fifty women, despite having changed nothing about my appearance or personality (except that I’ve gotten better at sex).

**I have never slept with someone who I approached as a stranger**. I don’t approach strangers very often, and when I do it’s never to pick them up. I realize this is a good skill to have, and **there is value in overcoming approach anxiety, but you do not have to do it to be successful with women.** Overcoming approach anxiety is about making great first impressions, and this can be done in other ways.

My game is extremely routine, and it consists of the following steps.

1. I send a girl a copy &amp; pasted message on OkCupid. 
2. If she responds, I initiate playful chat (often a game of “20 questions” or “Would you rather?”).
3. I gradually turn the conversation sexual.
4. I arrange a first date.
5. I close.

Most pick-up experts, here and elsewhere, discourage lingering on step 2; they recommend that you get the number as soon as possible and arrange a date. Screw that. I like to have my work done before the first date. The work gets done on steps 2 and 3, and (with the exception of step 5) step 3 is where I have the most fun.

The reason that this does actually work is because it’s possible to do before the first meeting what most people do after the approach: build rapport, build attraction, and escalate. Of course, rapport and attraction must be confirmed during the first meeting and some escalation must occur, but this can easily be taken care of by planning and implementing a good first date, as I’ll explain. Some people will still deny that it is impossible to really build rapport and attraction without meeting in person first, and regrettably I can only reply that it has worked countless times in my experience.

Now, I know that guides have been written regarding online game before, but many of them also share the mentality of arranging a first date as soon as possible. As such, the following guide is primarily for people who would like an alternative to building rapport and attraction after approaching a stranger.

**Set Up a Free Online Dating Profile**

I recommend OkCupid.com. It’s targeted at younger people and students, but I’ve also had a lot of luck with women in the 27-33 age bracket. Set up a profile, and follow the [guidelines]( http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/wiki/dosanddontsprofile) found at r/okcupid.

**“Approaching”**

Once you’ve got your profile set up, it’s time to start sending out messages. Use the search function of whatever website you’re on to find women (or men) you’re attracted to. Make sure to check their profiles to make sure they aren’t grossly incompatible with you in some way. 

Outside of the above, you don’t really need to invest much time analyzing profiles. This is because you’re just going to be sending everyone a generic, copy &amp; pasted message. Most people will advise against doing this, because you’re more likely to get a response if you write a personalized message.  However, you do not want people replying based on your message, but rather based on whether or not they like your profile. If you send a generic message, you can be confident that anyone who replies likes your profile and is interested in talking to you.

The following is an example of the type of message you should send:

“Hey. I just came across your profile. You’ll have to excuse me if this is overly brazen, but I find you really attractive. Send me a message and let’s chat.”

Most women will ignore this. However, of the 5-10% that do reply, most will be interested in chatting with you.

**Laying Down the Foundation**

Once someone has replied to your message and seems interested in talking to you, exchange the usual pleasantries and then initiate a game. I usually start with “*Would you rather?*” This is a fantastic game because (1) it is a great way of getting to know someone’s preferences and (2) it practically turns itself sexual. If you’ve never played the game, here’s an example:

You: Would you rather have $100 million or your dream job?

Her: Dream job. Would you rather have a pet tiger or a pet eagle?

You: A tiger, obviously. Would you rather go skinny dipping in freezing water or have sex in a sauna?

And so forth. Other options include *20 questions*, in which (ignoring the rules of the actual game) you just ask each other questions, and *Truth or Dare*. 

Playing these types of games, despite what you may believe, does build rapport. Furthermore, if you can conduct yourself intelligently and charmingly, you can also build attraction this way. It helps, of course, to have an attractive photo on your profile, because that’s how she’ll imagine you in her mind. If you consider yourself to be less than attractive, just make sure you have a flattering picture and try to look as good as possible during your first meeting.

Another good tip is to call her before meeting her. In my experience, women are more comfortable meeting you the first time if they’ve already heard your voice, even if it’s just to ask for or confirm directions. Fortunately, after a bit of chatting online, it’s easy to transition to a brief phone conversation. In fact, if your game of “*Would you rather?*” turns particularly racy, suggesting that you continue over the phone tends to initiate phone sex without fail. And while phone sex isn’t necessary by any means, I’ve never failed to close a girl after having phone sex with her first.

**The First Date**

Once you feel like a girl’s buying temperature is particularly high (she’s enjoying talking about sex with you and seems interested in meeting), then you arrange a first date. If you don’t already have her phone number, ask for it (“I’m signing off; give me your number so I can text you”).

**Choosing what to do on the first date is crucially important.** If you go from being a fun, sexual guy online to having a coffee date, she will be thrown off and you will flop. Whatever you decide to do, keep these points in mind:

1. Make sure you’re able to kino

2. Make sure you’re somewhere where kissing is socially acceptable

3. Know somewhere that you can go if things escalate successfully

This is all standard advice, but it’s **crucially important** here because you’ve already established a sexual frame with her. If you meet for the first time and you’re reluctant or unable to touch her, kiss her, or bounce her, then she’ll feel like you were fake and are unable to deliver on a fantasy that she built in her head.

My go-to date is actually a bit unorthodox: a local swingers’ club. Yes, I routinely convince girls I’ve never met to meet me for the first time in a coffee shop (because it’s a safe setting for that initial meeting) and then immediately accompany me to a clothing-optional, fuck-on-any-surface-you-like swingers’ club. How do I do this? I emphasize the fact that it’s clean, friendly, sex-positive, no-pressure, and has both a pool and a sauna.

However, I realize that most people don’t have this. As such, this is my recommendation: go anywhere with a billiard table. Escalating is never easier than when you’re playing pool. Something about the adversarial nature of the game plus the close proximity just makes it incredibly easy to touch a girl. I’m typically awkward when it comes to touching women, but it all seems to fade away during a one-on-one game of pool. Of course, if you have another preferred method, do whatever you find best.

The story from this point is the same as always: kino, go for the kiss, and then continue to escalate until she’s ready to go home with you (or fuck on the club’s pool table, if you’re also fortunate enough to be in a pro-sex establishment).

**[End]**

You can dedicate as much or as little time to this method as you like. I usually spend about half an hour per day on OkCupid sending the odd message; sometimes more if I’m in a heated game of *20 questions*. I typically try to move it to texting, as I carry my phone with me everywhere. Messages can be sent so quickly and to so many women that it’s almost unfair. On any given day, you could quickly message a hundred women, five of whom will want to meet. A little bit of additional messaging might reveal that, of those five, three are significantly more open about their sexuality than the other two. A little bit more harmless flirting and you’ve got three easy closes lined up, for only as much as a game of pool and a drink cost.

This obviously isn’t the best method for everyone. There are social benefits to be had from approaching and approaching often, and if you have trouble approaching random strangers, I recommend you at least try to build that skill. However, if you don’t like approaching strangers with the intention of picking them up, I hope this guide might be helpful to you.

If you have any questions or criticisms, post them and I’ll do my best to reply.

Along with this it might help to check out the TED talk regarding body language, it is a good supplement to the book.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc (TED Talk with Amy Cuddy)

Let me briefly explain...

Body language on the seduction guide here was glossed over like a burger in a vegans home.  This shit is one of the most paradigm shifting things I have ever read and I have already seen a MAJOR improvement in my life by being more aware of my and others body language.

The actual science details that by having open, powerful body language we can quite literally change our brain chemicals positively.  Brain chemicals are responsible for our state, our zone, and if you can influence those, you feel like a boss.  By doing power poses we will raise our testosterone (dominance, confidence, aggressiveness, leader brain chemical) levels and simultaneously lower our cortisol (stress hormone!) levels.  

Primates will naturally have raised testosterone and lowered cortisol when assuming the role of alpha male of the group.

Thus I implore to all of you, read up on body language, and OPEN YOUR GOD DAMN SELF UP.  It guarantees success.

Pretty much an awesome conversation starter too, people love hearing all the different things you have to say, and you can people watch with them after!  The omniscience is badass.

I was out last night with a group of friends and I was the designated driver, so I had the opportunity to observe the ongoings of the night with reasonable clarity and take away what lessons I could.

After entering the club and having a few drinks we started to get into the music and made our way onto the dance floor. We started dancing and lifting each others states, enjoying the music and generally having a good time when I noticed two middle aged women that stuck out like sore thumbs in the club on the dance platform in front of us. At the risk of sounding shallow, they were not attractive in the slightest. The first woman had a short, auburn hair style and looked like she had endured several life times of drug and alcohol abuse, and the second was a tall blonde with a terribly mis-shaped body and the face of a particularly unfortunate meth junkie.

So we continued to dance and have a good time when suddenly the blonde pulls one of my buddies up onto the platform and starts dancing with him. I assume at first that he is being a good sport by going along with this - he is laughing and having a good time with it. After about 20 seconds she goes straight in for the kiss, he dodges it, much to my relief, and continues dancing and grinding up against her and I continue under the assumption that he is simply entertaining her.

Two and a half hours later, after witnessing the two of them making out constantly and having dry sex on the dance floor, I came to the realisation that he wasn't just playing around.

Now I know what some of you might be thinking at this stage - ""You're just jealous, stop putting down your buddies achievements"". I can assure you, however, that this is not what this post is about. In fact, I felt happy for him at this stage - he was getting in there and having a good time and enjoying himself. 

Beer goggles aside, he was hooking up with a girl he was attracted to and had moved forward that night.

But what really struck me, was a conversation I had with him after we had left the club and were grabbing some burgers to stave off the 4am hunger pains.

As we were waiting for our burgers to be made he said to me - ""That was awesome, it's not often that a girl hits on me like that - it's been a very long time. She was hot, I wonder what was wrong with her?"".

Here I was, standing in front of this dude that I would gladly rate as more attractive than myself and the only way he could justify a pretty average girl hooking up with him was that if something was wrong with her. I shook my head and thought ""Damn, you poor guy"".

At that point it just hit me, and I had what alcoholics refer to as 'a moment of clarity' - it simply doesn't matter how attractive you are if you don't believe in yourself. If you don't even value yourself enough to the point that you believe that you deserve the attraction of beautiful women - then it doesn't matter how good you look. If you can't get there mentally, if you don't KNOW that you are the fucken shit and that you're dick has been dipped in pure gold, then you'll be stuck with 40 year old meth heads and wondering what you did right to get them to be attracted to you.

I think it was Willy Wonka that said ""Invention, my dear friends, is 93% perspiration, 6% electricity, 4% evaporation, and 2% butterscotch ripple. ""

Well in that case ""Pickup, my dear friends, is 93% self belief, 6% knowledge, 4% masturbation, and 2% looks.""

Believe in yourself guys, because if you don't, no one else will.

With the women I go on a date with, the majority I have sex with. Almost all will at least make out.

Contrast that with how I used to be: I'd meet a decent number of women, but rarely close the deal.

Here's the only difference: now I make the move. I ESCALATE.

It's *okay to display sexual interest.* Let me repeat that. **It's OKAY to show sexual interest.**

Imagine you are on a date with a girl. You make a joke, she laughs. TOUCH HER ARM. ""Hey, you have a super-cute laugh! But don't get ahead of yourself, I barely know you yet.""

~~Good sexual chemistry, and you step into an empty elevator together? Slowly close in on her, and kiss her. Try it!~~ Don't do this. Don't try something on a woman, that you haven't done before with her, in an enclosed space where she can't get away. That's... inconsiderate at best. Thanks, kittenmitton, for the feedback.

""Rejection,"" meaning she turns her cheek towards you? Not a big deal. *It's probably not you!* It's anything from, she needs more comfort, to she's not comfortable in public, to she's startled and just needs more notice. Every single time a girl was into me, and I went for the kiss and got denied, I went for it later and it worked.

How many times have you been kicking yourself alone, thinking, ""Man, I should've got her number. Man, I should've kissed her. Man, I should've...""

Life is short. And you're a man. Women are HOT. Talk to them. Touch them on the arm. Trust your instincts! When you think they like you, they probably do! If you've been talking to the same lady for 5 or 10 minutes, and she seems to be enjoying herself, show some interest. If she's not digging it? Great! Now you can move on and stop wasting time.

Also, I really recommend limiting the fapping. When you're standing there, in front of that hottie, with 5+ days of stored up semen, it's 10 times easier to make the move.

Every weekend my friend who I met at a mens support group has BBQ's at his place.  Before it was heating up we were tossing around a football until I jammed my ringfinger, which is still pretty swollen.  



Anyway, he introduced me to this lady he's been working with for a bit, gorgeous green eyes, nice hair, amazing body, I'll call her hbgreeneyes.  I talked to her for a minute, compared tatts; a few more dudes started showing up and I became a little more competitive for her attention.  I excused myself to check on the grill, it was then I started thinking...I can either keep talking to hbgreeneyes or I can have fun, giving me a better chance in the long run.  It wasn't until this morning that I realized a girl is going to respond better to the guy who's chatting everyone up, laughing and joking around, rather than the guy who follows her around all night struggling to make conversation.



After a couple drinks and a few more people show up I'm talking to everyone there, just being playful and enjoying myself.  I get my carne asada (skirt steak for all the East Coasters) from the grill, and have hbgreeneyes chop it up nice, telling her she's gotta have a taco, so I brown a tortilla after mine are toasted.  A little more joking and laughing, I ask her to help me find my drink in the other room, so I grab her hand, lead her into the living room.  She asks where my drink is at, I tell her it's over to my right, at this point I'm staring into her eyes, she stares back, we just start kissing...I'll leave it at that. The whole time I'm holding a small bag of ice for my jammed finger, lol.  



Afterwards I thought about how I'll see hbgreeneyes again at another BBQ, maybe we'll go further, maybe we won't, and maybe she'll be fooling around with some other guy.  The big step for me is being open to this world of casual dating, hooking up, and enjoying women instead of insecurely claiming them in hopes they don't leave me.

**Edit:** Thank you for all the comments, I read every single one.  The different perspectives make for great discussion!

As I was reading I noticed a two major disagreements that I would like to address:

**1)** I need a drink or two to just to raise my energy and let me be social.

**2)** Not drinking makes you look like a creeper, makes things awkward, and makes you look like you are preying on drunk girls

These comments are amazing things to address because *these are the reasons* that we drink.
**They Are Misguided and Will Hurt Your Game!**

**1)** The sober you at the bar is the same person that you were the first day you thought about meeting women. The person you were at the beggining of your sedduction adventure. You struggle to approach, to open, to hold a conversation, to tease, to escalate, and you struggle to close.  The reason is you used alcohol was to skip steps. You are a slave to alcohol now for the rest of your life because your game requires it.  The first day out sober I was doing No Drink November, and it was weird, I could not approach I could not do anything, when just the week before I was balls deep in the girl with the red dress, boning in the bathroom of a nightclub, I stole her dress and ran around the club. It was the most epic close of my life, but without the booze on which I had been training my game unconsciously with for 6 years, I was at square 1, with no idea how I did it...
So like every good sedditor I stared at square one, just saying hi to people, then asking them about their day, building up my skills. Three months later, I have K-closed at least 6 women in the last two night, danced my ass off on open dance floors with people watching incredulously, and have had several propositions for sex from the women whose faces I'm eating. All, Sober.  Having fun and bringing the energy is not something you have, it is something you learn. Everything you do with a beer in you is something you can do better at sober if you stop being lazy and work at learning it.

**Alchohol is *Always* a crutch** as is every other drug, nothing is wrong with you, so stop using it if you want to get much better, much faster. (Unless it is your schizophrenia medication, in which case it is a crutch you may actually need.)

**2)** ""Not drinking makes you look like a creeper and a stalker, what do you do if they ask?"" You just tell them the truth! You say you are out hanging out  with your friends and you are doing a no drink whatever the month, or a New Years resolution. That is what I'm doing not drinking for 2013. Not drinking is something to *brag about!*.  They are always amazed you have the balls to go out and have fun. And if they don't ask which *they usually never do*, after we have a crazy good time and I make out with them, and then it comes up, or I bring it up, they are always stunned and ask me how I am able to just start kissing a girl when I haven't been drinking. I tell them I am a man who knows what I want! They usually proposition me for sex at this point.

Myth: makes you creepy. **BUSTED**

Makes you look like you are preying on drunk women? Fuck no, The only time you look like this is if the girl was wasted and then you would be preying on her, with booze in you or not.

**TL/DR:** even one drink is a crutch, don't do, **No Excuses**. The reason you look like a creeper is that you have no game sober, so work on it! Not drinking makes women wet for you. Don't try fucking chicks who are wasted, whether you are wasted or not.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1359259158.0,,,True,t3_17b9cp,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/17b9cp/be_sober/,

So I'm out and about in my new spot in Florida. Last night I had a date with a girl who recently moved here from NY. She's pretty much a spot-on Zooey Deschanel doppelganger. Who knew Florida had hipsters?

Anyway, I could tell she's the nerdy type so I invite her out to trivia night at a local bar. It seems like a fun date thing to do, allows a lot of room for teasing. Here is our text conversation for reference:

---

&gt; **Me:** I'm gonna hit the gym for a bit. Can you meet at eight tonight?  3:25 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Sure where  3:25 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Actually........ its trivia night at [da bar] Let's do it. We gotta get there before seven though. Say 6:45?  3:29 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Sure that's fun!!! I love trivia  3:30 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Awesome. I'm like the ken Jennings of trivia (wait what?)  3:31 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Lmao..  3:43 PM

---

**Small DHV with the gym line, never hurts. Afterwards I am basically going for basic cocky/funny nerd humor. I knew she'd appreciate it. Try and calibrate to the girl if you can.**

Anyway, we arrive and it's dead... Apparently they are taking a 2 week hiatus on trivia. WHOOPS. I stick to standard rapport building stuff and let her do most of the talking. We drink a couple beers and the date is going meh. We're sitting at a table with no opportunity for kino and the conversation is getting stale. I say ""Let's go someplace else. There's a bar I've been meaning to try out.""

**Always try and keep the leader frame. Girls respect guys who make the decisions as to where the night is going.**

I tell her I'll drive so we don't need to take two cars. We zip over to the bar and... it's also empty. We look at one another and I go ""Yeah... let's go someplace else...""

We walk up the block to another bar and FINALLY, a place with some atmosphere. I sit us at the bar so we can kino properly and order us some drinks. When the bartender checks her ID I joke ""She's underage."" She laughs, I continue with basic witty banter about nonsense. She seems to like it, but I can tell I'm not in yet.

Eventually we leave that bar and walk back to the bar that was dead earlier. I go to put my hand around her waist and she's not having it... Hmm... I still have work to do with this girl. **I know I say not to waste time looking for IOIs, but it's important to know when you still have more work to do when on a date. Pay attention to these cues and feel free to do compliance tests as necessary.**

We arrive and the bar is bumpin - packed with the cool crowd. WOO, finally a good bar in this city for a weeknight!

I sit us in the booth in the corner. She initially puts her purse between us and I look her in the eye and go ""Nuh-uh,"" as I move the purse and motion for her to sit right next to me. She does. Finally, making some progress :)

---

**What sealed the deal for me - fucking hipsters**
 
We chat some more and then that Gotye song comes on... 

&gt; **Me:** I like this song.

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Yeah, I first heard of Gotye last summer.

&gt; **Me:** Heh, what a hipster thing to say.

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** I even have hipster glasses. *pulls glasses out of purse and puts them on*

&gt; **Me:** Wow, between that and the bangs you look like Zooey Deschanel.

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Please, I had this look way before Zooey Deschanel.

&gt; **Me:** *as I smack her arm playfully* You fucking hipster! 

She turns beet red, realizing she had just said **what is possibly the most hipster sentence ever uttered in the history of mankind.**

We both have a good laugh and I realize this is the moment where her buying temperature spikes. I pull her in - BOOM - sloppy bar makeout. Some guys sitting across from us start cheering us on. feelsgoodman.jpg :)

We make out some more, finish our drinks, and decide to leave. I ask her if she wants to hang some more, she does... We decide to go get her car and drive to her house.

When we get to her car, I press her up against it and make out in the rain. As we do this, some guy on a bicycle yells out ""YEAH WOO!!"" She says, ""Why does that keep happening?!"" with a giant smile on her face. These are those hilarious moments that you can latch on to that make a good first date. When they happen, just take a mental note.

We zip to her house, walk into her bedroom, and the rest is history. 

Good times :)

---

**EDIT:** notlurkinganymoar requested some more details about how I met this girl and got her on the date, etc. So here goes...

The previous weekend I went out solo to scope out the scene. I basically watched basketball and sipped drinks like a chode while observing the locals to get the lay of the land.

After all the games were over, I walked down the strip and started opening warm-up sets. I was ice cold, so I started by opening a group of cops, then a group of guys, then a mixed set. My go-to line was ""Hey I'm new in town, what's the best bar around here?""

It got me more or less in state, so I kept going until I found a worthy set. I wandered into a bar and found a 3-set of girls choding it up in the corner. I approached and went ""Wow, you guys seem as bored as I am. What's up, I'm TofuTofu?"" I made small talk with all 3 and quickly determined 2 of them were cold but 1 was receptive. I made her my focus (really nothing but innocent small talk) and exchanged numbers ""so we can explore the city together."" Honestly it was as benign as it gets - it shows sometimes you don't need fancy *game* you just need to have balls to approach. Of course it might explain why I had to work so hard on the day-2, because I never established a sexual frame.

Here is the text transcript:

&gt; **Me:** OMG 8:28 PM

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Hey u  8:29 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Hi. Out and about?  8:34 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Eating portugese food and watching jenns roomates play call of duty.. were leaving soon  8:35 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Not even sure what Portuguese food is :-)  8:36 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Spanish.. beef and spicy shrimp stuff.. I'm obviously not portugese haha  8:37 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Heh. So where you guys going next?  8:45 PM 

&gt; **Me:** I'm gonna head over to [da bar]. Wanna join?  8:52 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Were setting off fireworks  9:14 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Sorry definitely another night  9:14 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Gosh I'm such a lightweight. 2 drinks and I'm drunk lol  9:15 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Sounds like a fun day :-)  9:24 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Cool. How about Monday night? I can keep it free  9:24 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** Yeah sure  9:25 PM 

&gt; **Me:** Cool. I'll text you Monday. Enjoy your fireworks  9:26 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** OK. :-) no problem.. enjoy your night!  9:26 PM 

&gt; **HB-Zooey:** My night was s bust. Ended up at [da bar] at the port  1:18 AM

Then we texted on Monday and met.

Another thing I forgot to mention was that I let the conversation get sexual... I brought up this crazy DHV story about a one night stand I had in SF where a girl gave me her safeword, which was ""kazoo"" (how fucking hilarious is that!) Then after I loosened her up a bit to talk about sexual stuff, she started talking about sexy costumes she's worn for Halloween and different events. She started showing me pics, which led me to talk about how, ""I love how sometimes I'll ask a girl for naked pics and she'll send me some in like 2 seconds, so I KNOW those are ones she is reusing from other guys."" Then she says, ""Hah I totally do that,"" and proceeds to show me her nudez on her phone :)

Anyway, the moral of the story is - if you are confident and congruent - feel free to talk about sexual things during dates. It makes for great conversation and most girls are kinkier than you'd think! Also it sets you apart from most AFCs who are afraid to talk about anything sexual, then get surprised later on when she thinks you're an asexual loser who can only escalate when piss drunk!",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_tcvrw,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tcvrw/fr_fclose_zooey_deschanel_lookalike/,

I list this as #1 because your visits to the gym are about more than just getting fast and strong (although that's very important). I recommend getting a membership at a gym that's big on weight lifting and filled with a bunch of good-looking people. Why? Because, chances are, you will *never* see a club, bar, or lounge with as many attractive people as at your gym. It provides an understated confidence boost and this makes approaches very easy.

2. Eat well. Don't put junk in your body. People think this is just about getting fat, but it's also about your mental clarity and hormones. When you eat at McDonald's, Pizza Hut, hell, ANY chain restaurant in the United States, you're filling yourself up with excess garbage. Your body is not designed to consume the abundance of oil, fat, and sugar that you get when you eat at a chain place, so don't. Buy your own groceries, cook your own food. Your body and your wallet will thank me.

3. Think positively. A lot of people misconstrue derision of others and self-disparagement as meaning you're being honest with yourself or your surroundings. This ""honesty"" trap becomes a self-feeding negative cycle. Instead, block out all unnecessary negative thinking. 99% of the time, your negative thoughts have no relevance on your goals or even your day. When you think positive, you look positive, and that's the type of person people (not just girls) want to be around.

4. Stop thinking of Game as a big deal. At it's core, Game is just talking to people. You're improving your social skills. You're not unlocking a forbidden alternate universe where women suddenly worship your cock.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_op3yo,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/op3yo/lifehacks_sorta_that_help_with_game/,
1290898319.0,195,self.seduction,ecmm8,How I go from number to first date,241,46,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ecmm8/how_i_go_from_number_to_first_date/,"I see lots of people here making very rookie mistakes before they even get to first date. [Mouthpiece's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e645m/text_game_how_to_improve/) on text game has very good advice that everyone should follow. Here are the steps I follow, pretty much the same every time, to get from digits to a first date.

If you follow this advice, at least in the US, you will see a much lower flake rate. I made some big tweaks over time to arrive at this technique about 20 first dates ago, and since then, I've only had 1 girl not respond to my text (turns out she has a serious BF), 1 girl reschedule same day (legitimate reason, I'm still seeing her), and 2 girls show up more than 10 minutes late (women right?).

Here's my strategy:

* I meet a girl, talk to her, isolate, and escalate kino up to but *not including* the kiss (unless I'm going for a same-night hookup). Sometimes it's only light touching, other times it's a lot hotter and heavier, but basically to the point I'm sure she's very interested.
* At this point, anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes later, if I want her number instead of a same-night hookup, I leave the bar (or wherever). Before I leave, I say ""hey I have to go [meet friends blah] but I've really enjoyed talking to you."" She either nods or says something like ""me too."" I say ""we should talk more some time soon"". She says ""yeah that would be good."" I say ""how can we make that happen?"" She says ""I can give you my number"". This sounds weird at first. I read about the technique on Seddit and was skeptical, but it works like magic. I've *never* been refused for any reason. It reduces the flake rate because you basically made it ""her idea"" to give you her number.
* I put her number into my phone. I always ask for her last name, she always gives it to me. Just one more little thing she has ""invested"".
* If I haven't built a ton of attraction, I will try to hook a little more here, by saying something like ""You're single and like guys, right?"" or ""You know I'm going to ask you out, right?"" They always give an overly enthusiastic ""yeah!"" and it seems to improve responsiveness.
* If she is standing next to me, and it's not too loud, I'll call her right away and have a ridiculous teasing conversation, something like ""OMG its cheddar. You have to help me! This weird stalker girl just gave me her number what should I do??""
* If it's loud, or I need to get out of there, I'll leave, but text her *immediately* with a text that says ""good meeting you tonight. I'll see you soon unless [heckle]! :)"" where [heckle] is some playful tease, hopefully referencing the night, like ""unless you get swallowed up by your monster handbag!"" (I frequently tease girls about their mammoth handbags)
* The next day, late afternoon (usually around 4pm), I text her with something like ""hey enjoying this crazy day? come meet me tomorrow at [chill bar] at [8]!""
* I always pick a bar that is not too busy, not too loud, cheap, and has places to sit where it's natural for us to sit next to each other or at right angles, instead of across from each other.
* If for some reason we had to reschedule or it's going to be more than one day between when I ask her out and when we do go out, I text her the day of the date, usually around 3-4pm, saying ""see you at 8!""
* If she starts texting me with a bunch of smalltalky stuff, I will respond but with long, unpredictable pauses in between. Since there is usually only 72 hours max between when I get her number and when we have a first date, this conveniently also keeps the casual texting to a minimum.
* In the rare occasion that she cancels, e.g. ""sorry I can't make it tonight! Raincheck?"" I'll just text back ""Sure NP. I'll text you later in the week."" Then wait about 3 days and ask her out the same way, with no texting in between.
* Then the date is on. I do normal game, lots of kino escalation, then bounce to a second bar after about 1-2 hours, then assuming things are greenlit, bounce back to my place after another 1-2 hours.

YMMV obviously, but after many tweaks I think this is the optimum technique for me.

**Common mistakes people make between number and first date**

I see many of the following on Seddit. In order of importance:

* Don't wait more than a couple days before asking her out! She may not even remember you, let alone still be attracted to you. Strike while the iron is hot. I frequently see guys who have waited 2+ *weeks*, this is a huge mistake.
* Don't incessantly text back and forth before the first date, and don't respond immediately to all of her texts. It makes you seem needy and over-available and will kill attraction.
* Don't ever ask girls out on first dates with less than 24 hours notice. It gives her an easy out to say no, and some girls are just weird about making same-day plans.
* Don't discuss the time/place for the first date, present her with choices, or ask her where/when to go. It's an attraction killer and makes flaking more likely.
* Don't try to tease/neg/even joke over text with a girl you've only spent an hour or two with. It's too easy to misconstrue. If you really want to tease, make sure you include ""haha"" or "":)"" in your text.
* Don't cancel or reschedule dates unless absolutely unavoidable. Women do this, men do not.
* Don't offer her your number, make sure you ask for hers. Just saying ""hey I gotta go, give me your number"" is sufficient, and is what I used to do before employing the above technique.
* Don't add her on Facebook, or exchange emails, IM's, etc. This is personal style, but I'm a big advocate of avoiding ""online game"".

Im 18. No real problem with AA. Really social, talk to like everyone. Good-lookin. You get it.
Been out before, sober, two times. Have gotten 2#closes and 2-kcloses.

Tonight I went out after I drank some. My goal was to talk to even more people than I use to and just have fun. No girls tonight (girls didn't really have a chance with me tonight)
My stats were like 50+ people I talked too. A couple over 50 years old. Some milfs. Over 25 people in the first club + the two DJ's and some guards there.
On the way to the second club I talked to probably 10-15 people, I even opened a set of two policemen! Haha!
The other club was lamer. But still I had fun. Real fun. Danced like crazy, some girls danced with me and twerked their ass to my crotch. I danced for me only, not to get girls. So I didn't dance with a single girl like some guys did, I danced with all the dancefloor - when I saw somebody who wasn't giving 110% I approached them dancing and pumped them up. :)

Here I talked with maybe 10 people. Got one guys number, so next time we are going out. Talked to some guy who knew the people there, 30 years old! I took his fiance and danced with her while he was looking, smiled at him so he knew I was just having fun and I wouldn't try anything, he enjoyed it and smiled back :)
During the night I didn't talk to anybody for over 3-5minutes. Like some other people, they waste all their night talking to 1-2 girls. I just didn't give a fuck, even when I opened a set of 4 girls and they came back to me later.

Why? Wanted to try going out and not having girls in mind - even though I knew I would succeed. I wanted to try to go out and only have fun! And man it was madness. A lot funnier than usual!

**tl;dr: Read it all! // I ain't the one posting stuff here, but this night was r-i-d-i-c-u-l-o-u-s, total madness - so I had to!**

The cool thing is, I am full of energy now, maybe I even have more energy than yesterday. And im sober now.
:)))))

One more thing. Some tips to people struggling with AA. Just let it go and just do it. Because, who wants to die full of regrets? Dream about what life you want to live and live it!

1298824447.0,196,self.seduction,ftqqa,Dear Nice Guy Friend,302,106,373,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ftqqa/dear_nice_guy_friend/,"Girl here. I've been lurking here for a while because I'm interested in the psych aspect of pick-up and I have a few things I noticed about my friend. 

I went out last evening with a guy I met at school last week and we decided to hang out (not under the pretense of a date). We went out last night (our third time going out together, the first time we bar hopped and the second being a short snowboarding trip up north) so there is some history to the attraction build-up (or lack of). He's a handsome guy, and he keeps fit, so I wouldn't have hated it, but I just didn't feel hot for him.

He obviously wanted to lean over and kiss me when I dropped him off at this place at 4 a.m., but he had done such a painfully terrible job throughout the entire night that I couldn’t allow it to happen. I set the pace by saying I was tired during the drive and abruptly saying have a good night as he was leaning in for the kiss.

1. Social proof (this can come from texting while you guys are hanging out drinking). It’s not rude because we’re obviously just friends chilling for the moment and if he read texts (or pretended to), it would make it seem like he had friends or other places to be. I was texting over the night with these guys we met the first time we bar hopped, and it just made me seem like a cool person people wanted to be around. *Many have disagreed with this point, so use it carefully. I still believe glancing at your phone every once in a while is a good idea, telling your target about a joke your friend sent you, but I did not mean you should be texting all night.*

2. When I was complaining about being tired, if he had said something like “you’re such an old lady” and dismissed the fact that I was tired, I think It would have changed the dynamic.

3. Complaining about being cold, hungry, etc. Seriously, not hot.

4. Be spontaneous; know your city and know good places to go out: This is a fairly easy thing to do, but it takes a bit of research. Join some forums about your city, read bar reviews to get a sense of the vibe or the reputation of each spot, know what is going on that evening. You should be able to say, fuck this joint, let’s check out x spot because y is playing tonight. *I want to emphasize this. I'm often the one initiating plans. When a man has a plan, grabs me by the hand and leads the way, the attraction skyrockets.*

5. Compliment: Yeah, I know you guys don’t think this is a great idea but seriously, you need to drop one or two. He half-assedly complimented me when I said “I look like shit tonight”. He replied “I tend to disagree”, I smiled and awwwwed but then he got nervous and dropped a “just so you feel better”. I’ve always thought complimenting takes more confidence than it gives. Confident people recognize positive attributes in others and aren't intimidated by them. *Many of said this is fishing for compliments. Probama mentioned an interesting reply which I will include here:*
&gt;whenever a girl is blatantly fishing for a compliment like this, I never oblige. If you had said that to me, I'd probably have responded, ""yea, you sure do. aren't you embarrassed?"" with a cheeky smile*

6. Kino: you guys already know how important this is so I will go no further. *There is an interesting distinction to be made in kino. Post by famousmodification:*
&gt;Have you read DiCarlo's Escalation Ladder? He kind of touches on this, basically he suggests that you alternate incidental kino with more overt kino. The idea behind this is that after she's accepted the incidental stuff, she'll be comfortable with the more overt stuff like leading her by the hand. I think he also says not to make the overt kino too long since that increases the chances of her thinking about it and breaking it off, which is obviously bad for you.

7. Paying for drinks: I know this is frowned upon, but yeah, if you don’t buy the girl at least one drink, it will really look like you're not interested. Even friends do this for each other. *Very controversial. Upon further reflection, though it would not have hurt in my context, it is safer not to buy a girl a drink. You can read the comments if you're interested*

8. Being present: I’m pretty social myself so I talk to random people wherever I am. And this is an attractive trait for anybody, men and women. I would often open up people to talk, and laugh with them and he would literally fade away in the background. I honestly would forget he was there sometimes, until I was getting bored and turned around to see him right behind me smiling. Walk in the field of vision of the girl, not behind her. Make sure you’re somewhat loud and keep the conversation going. Make sure you are interacting with other people, and ignoring your target a bit. Show that you don’t need her to have a good time. Flirt with other girls, it makes you look sexy. An extreme example of him disappearing was I unfortunately got into a fight with a drunk girl and 2 guys and 2 girls got in between us, and I actually got teamed up against and he was nowhere to be seen. I completely forgot he was there until the shit calmed down and I turned around and he asked if I was o.k. Seriously, not attractive. 

9. Buzz kill: Never and I say never, say no to fun. I don’t care how cold you are or how tired, if there is a fucking outdoor slide and dodge ball on ice going on (which there was last night), don’t be the one to say you’re not in. This is a problem I suspect non-drinkers have, since you come across as a party pooper. But I rarely drink, and I often just say it in a fun way (e.g., I’ll shake my head and say I’m pregnant while placing a hand on my stomach).

10. Driving: I’m always driving him around. I don’t mind in the circumstances (4 a.m. on a cold night) or whatever, but he doesn’t seem to appreciate that it puts me in a superior position (i.e. I’m the driver and he’s the passenger). And if a chick is driving you, please know the directions. It’s pretty unattractive when a man doesn’t know his way around. Even if you know the girl will drive you anyway, offer to take a cab or metro. If she insists, then don’t press, but you should at least offer. Don’t make your target a soccer mom.

Things he did do right:

- He did dress nicely
- He’s pretty funny/clever
- Before making plans for last night, he said “I’ll text you tomorrow to work out the details”, which was pretty authoritative and it stuck with me more than something like “let me know if you’re still up for tomorrow”. I actually almost bailed on him if it wasn’t for that. I actually think this is called NLP ([neuro-linguistic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming)), subtle changes in wording or phrases causes people to react differently to what you say. I'm guessing a lot of seduction revolves around this, so worth picking up a book or two on the topic. Any recommendations?
- Before leaving me each time, he says “let’s do this again soon”. This got me twice so far, and I don’t think I’ll fall for it again, but it’s important that you create an expectation that you will meet again.
- He made some killer tuna sandwiches for both of us when we went snowboarding, which was thoughtful, without being too beta (I think). I felt like I was being taken care of, which is something I like to feel with men. But obviously, don't go too far with this.

Okay guys, have fun ^^

Long.",278,84,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1icf45/first_fr_met_a_hb9_at_the_beach_first_ever/,"So this is going to be long, so I'll try to format it so that you can skip to the section that most interests you if you don't want to read.

**a) Introduction**

So at 20 years old, I hadn't kissed or slept with a girl. Not to say girls hadn't tried to kiss me, but I always wanted to wait for something super awesome, which kept me from making any moves. This girl and the situation were so absolutely perfect, I had no excuses, and took it all the way.

In high school, I was incredibly unnattractive: body, personality, the works. I started learning and reading about seduction as a hobby, and although I never really had any interest in being a PUA, I thought it was a fun social experiment to try and see how much of an attractive person I could become. So I really began to buy into the self-improvement and inner game aspect of seduction. Of course, along the way I learned a lot of outer-game tricks and tips that I rarely used (simply because I never took things past a few dates, and never kissed). Tonight was absolutely different as I used nearly everything I learned to help guide the interaction to the outcome I wanted. But to avoid getting ahead, fast forward from high school, and I'm now 2 years into college. I'm an attractive guy with a fairly attractive body, an attractive personality, solid friends, good career, generally know what I'm doing but still nothing spectacular. I'm a 7-8/10. I'm able to meet new women with good success (but don't really feel comfortable cold approaching with success), and generally able to get people attracted to me, get dates, with consistency. I always kino-escalate very well but for some reason choose not to kiss women, and don't have sex (although I always frame our interactions as very sexual, attempting to discover what my limits are, and what women I can land). 

*Take-Away Points: You can move from an unattractive guy to an attractive guy by just putting time and effort into self-improvement. You don't need to immerse yourself in the PUA lifestyle, unless that is your goal, to see success.*

**b) Meeting the Girl**

So I'm walking to the beach for a social group event with my friends. I'm not always the dominant personality in the group, but I've noticed when I step up to take control of the situation (in the specific instances I choose to), others step out of the way. 

Anyway, one of my friends drives by in a minivan and yells ""Hey Thrw2! What's up?!"" I respond, and they leave. One of my other friends informs me that this guy showed up with several girls from out of town just for the weekend. Cool. 

Everyone heads to the water, I stay on the beach to tan. My friend and his girls show up, and I immediately start engaging them as a group, meeting them, and having short conversations. They all lay down their towels. Then, one girl comes and puts her towel right between me and another girl (who was in the water). There wasn't really any space, but she made space. She laid down and said ""Hi!"" Honestly right then, I knew something was gonna happen with this girl.

She is absolutely gorgeous. Perfect body. Thin, short, athletic, great boobs, well shaped butt. This girl is the definition of my type, and is an objective 8 or 9 to anyone, but a solid 9 to me. 

The rest of the few hours at the beach we chat some, and I send her several ""I want you"" looks, which she exchanges with me. I kino by holding her hand very abruptly at one point, build rapport by talking, communicate value by leading interactions in the group and flirting with the other girls. When HB9 is gone, one of the other girls mentions she is recently out of a 2 year relationship. I knowingly glance at the towel next to me, and she smiles and says ""Rebooound!"" I leave later, HB9 asks me if she will see me at a party that night, I say yes.

*Take-Away Points: Be able to recognize when a girl is into you. I could tell very early my goal was only to be able to remove any obstacles and transition smoothly, not overcome an attraction/value gap. This was key. We hadn't talked about anything other than our schools, majors, jobs, and music, but the nonverbal communication was clear that she was ready to go. Learn through practice how to recognize how interested a women is through her nonverbals.*

**c) The Party &amp; Escalation**

So I'm ridiculously sunburnt, and really don't want to go. My face is bright red, and it's fucking with my confidence. Finally I say to myself ""Look, you can overcome this with game. Lots of average-looking people get women and you're just sunburnt. So I clean my room, go buy some mints and condoms, and head to the party. I've never bought condoms before in my life, but for some reason I knew I was gonna have this girl tonight. 

At the party, we learn that my friend isn't bringing his girls 'til much later in the night. So I invite some other attractive women, forget about HB9, and start having a good time. When HB9 arrives, I'm the center of a drinking game with an HB7 and HB8.5 beside me (neither are very attracted to me, but they are both very friendly and HB9 certainly can't tell the difference. We subtly avoid each other for the next 10 minutes, but when I catch the eye I give her the subtle smug ""I want to fuck you"" look. *Master this. From my limited experience I know this look turns girls on.* I notice she starts to move towards a large chair, and I join her and we sit down simultaneously, with my arm around her. I say ""Hey."" She says ""Hi."" We don't really talk but I escalate kino rapidly, moving my hands up her thighs as we watch the party. After a little bit things calm down and everyone heads to the couches. She looks at me and says ""All your friends are really mellow drunks."" I say ""Well then maybe I should take you in there [look towards bedroom] and fuck you."" I didn't phrase it like a question. She glares at me, I hold her stare, then she looks away and says ""ummm..."" looks like she's thinking for about 5 seconds, then says ""No."" She immediately gets up and walks away. I don't react, and yell for another guy to join me on the chair. He does, and we jokingly start cuddling for a while. 

The rest of the night is hilarious. I don't really speak to her much, and I have a great time. Every once in a while I catch her eye, give her the look, and she comes to sit by me. I'll say something like ""You know I'm going to take you home tonight."" or ""I can't wait to fuck you."" and she gets up and leaves. This repeats 4-5 times with no other conversation over an hour. This girl is shit-testing the fuck out of me. I handle it all perfectly. This stage is really where I shine. Later I'm on the couch and she's on the floor. She motions for me to join her, and I motion for her to join me. She looks away, so I start flirting with the girl beside me. She leaves, and I go to sit on the floor with a friend. As soon as she sees me on the floor, she runs back and sits directly in front of me. She hints away for a while, trying to get me to kiss her. I don't and I tell her I value privacy, she says she respects that. I say ""Besides, once I kiss you, I'm going to fuck you. But it might be fun to rip your clothes off in front of everyone."" From this point on, the shit tests of that stage are over. It was like I had abruptly unlocked the next level. We cuddle and I kino rapidly, moving towards her breasts, between her legs, or ass, grabbing things when others aren't looking. Finally she says ""Go to the kitchen."" While usually, I don't respond to any orders or anything, I did without hesitation. She comes right behind me, grabs me, and we make-out for 10 minutes or so. Fucking awesome. We head back to the living room, she sits across from me. A few minutes later, she gets on her hands and knees, very slowly walks across the to me, getting everyone's attention, and kisses me. We make out in the middle of the room. Ridiculously hot, and doubly awesome considering a couple of people I used to be involved with (who are not nearly as hot) were watching. This is going to give me a lot of future respect from this friend group, I think. She was seriously way out of my league.

Then she goes into this strange ""decision making mode"" where she keeps leaving me to talk to her friends. She's obviously talking about me and I remain self-amused, and occasionally give her and her friends a smug look, and they all laugh when I do this. Then she goes and talks to minivan guy friend, who she is staying with. They talk for a while, and she leaves for the bathroom. I ask him what the deal is. He sort of incredulously says ""She just asked me if it was OK if she went home with you?"" I said ""well?"" he said ""Yeah I mean I told her definitely, but said you were a virgin. It kinda freaked her out."" She returns from the bathroom, sits beside me, and immediately says ""Are you a virgin?"" I reply ""Wanna find out?"" she says ""Just tell me."" without hesitating I say ""Yep"" like it's not a big deal. She says ""So we probably aren't gonna have sex?"" and I reply ""We won't do anything you aren't comfortable with."" Gold. This throws it back on her and she doesn't know how to respond. She comes up with ""Well I mean you won't have sex with me."" and I respond ""Woah, I only wanted to hold hands."" This seems to satisfy her.

Next she starts asking about how she is going to get home etc. Anytime she shit tests, I respond correctly, but when she asks a logistical question, I respond very seriously and maturely. She occasionally tries to get me to convince her to come home with me. I don't fall for these. She says ""We probably shouldn't do this."" I respond ""Yeah, we shouldn't."" Then she asks ""But can you take me back to minivan guy's house?"" I say ""Definitely, I can take you back anytime before 9:30."" It was critical to be able to distinguish a shit-test of ""I wanna see if you'll try to convince me to fuck you"" and an actual ""I need you to solve this logistical problem for me."" She asks me to get her girlfriend's phone numbers, and I do this seriously as well. I met them earlier but can't remember their names, so I hand them my phone and say ""Can you put your last name in too?"" 

*Take-Away Points: Be able to be self-amused in any situation. Have other options. She played push/pull with me for a while and I was able to transition from her to someone else easily.*

*Make sure you help her handle the logistics. Ahead of time I mentioned to my friends I may try to take her home, so when she started asking around about me, my friends winged for me. I also was responsible and serious when I talked with her friends and assured them I'd take care of her.*

*Be comfortable handling different types of shit-tests. Even though I only browse seddit occasionally, I felt like I recognized them all and knew how to handle them when they showed up.*

*Know your audience. I knew this girl was into me, and I made no efforts to impress or attract her. My only game was making it convenient and comfortable for her to say ""yes"" to me. I played the aggressor in terms of taking her home so she could feel comfortable with that decision.*

**d) My house**

We go to my house and I escalate with something similar to the ever-popular Di-Carlo Escalation ladder which I happened to remember. Everything goes smoothly (although I'm not that great at anything...). Then I ask, ""Should I get a condom."" she says ""No. I'm not having sex with you."" in a very, very serious tone. I say ""Ok."" and keep kissing her. A minute later she says ""I don't do virgins."" I just say ""Ok."" Rather than abruptly freezing her out, which I had planned to do, I decided that would be a butthurt reaction. I slowly ramped things down, and then took it to cuddling. She tries to kiss me and I say ""You probably just want to cuddle right?"" I keep teasing her as I quickly ramp things up, as she is visibly turned on, then shut it down with some comment like ""This is probably too fast for you."" 

Finally she says ""Turn me on."" I do, and then she asks, ""Do you have a condom?"" I say ""Yes"" but don't get it. I'm not really sure if I want to do this anymore. A few minutes later she says ""I'm so confused, do you not want me?"" and I realize there's no way I can pass up this gorgeous babe without regretting it. The rest is history. It wasn't really great sex for either of us, but she was really nice and very very considerate. We communicated really well, and it was surprisingly a super intimate experience. Unfortunately, it was clear she wasn't as attracted to me at this stage as she was before when there was more mystery and intrigue. To be expected as this was my first time. I'm just glad I built up enough momentum in earlier stages. Afterwards I realized I forgot to ask how old she is. I ask, and she responds ""16."" and we laugh. She's the same age as me, 20. 

**e) Aftermath**

It sounds like she wants to see me again. She wanted me to hang again with her before she left, but I wasn't able to. Although we live 2 hours apart, I drive past her city often. I told her I'd stop by to fuck her and she seemed receptive. Hilariously, I also discovered she also has an identical twin sister. 

Any advice on how to handle the relationship from here? I'd like to keep it going long term and be able to see her whenever it's convenient to visit (and honestly, it's gonna be very convenient to visit 10-15 times over the next year, which would be awesome.) I didn't get much of a one-night stand vibe from her.

I also had a little bit of an existential crisis the next day. I'm pretty sure I'm never gonna be able to land anyone more attractive than her. This girl was it. It was a perfect situation. I feel like I just climbed Mt. Everest and there isn't anything left to do. I'm sure others have experienced this, and I wouldn't mind some self-improvement tips dealing with that emotion.

I was getting a drink with a coworker last night and saw HB9 at the bar. The seat next to her opened up and I told my friend ""I'll be right back in 2 minutes, I'm going to go get rejected by this girl.""

Just to give you some context, my girlfriend dumped me 6 weeks ago for another guy. We dated for over 2 years and she broke up with me with a clinical 3min 41sec phone call. I felt humiliated and undervalued. In the past 6 weeks I dropped 20 lbs (thanks Fittit!) and I've been opening a few sets per week. I'm pretty absurd at comfort building and kino but my opening game is absolute garbage, for now.

I walked up to her and opened with ""hey you look interesting so I'll talk to you. I'm a 5th grade science teacher and I'm trying to decide on a class pet."" She said ""hermit crab,"" and I spent the rest of the night periodically negging her for picking the ugliest animal on the planet. Building the ""I'm a caring and charming young teacher"" identity, I showed her some pictures of my classroom on my phone -- total chick crack. 

Later:
Her: ""I'm actually a model""
Me:  ""what like a hand model?""
Her: ""I was in Playboy, but I'm quitting modeling and I'm trying to switch careers""
Me: ""That can be scary. My mom grew up in a tiny superstitious village in India and she believed she could tell your future by reading your palm.""

At this point she pressed her hand into mine and asked me to read it. I took my time reading it then chucked her hand back to her, joking that she was just looking for an excuse to hold my hand. I asked her if she's a ""top"" or ""bottom"" when she holds hands with guys (like how a couple's hands are oriented). I told her that with some of my girlfriends I was a bottom but lately I've only been a top. We ""practiced"" holding hands as though we were a couple. She interrupts me to say there was a hookah bar nearby and we should go smoke. 

A Playboy model bounced ME.

We kissed pretty viciously at the hookah bar. She showed me some pics on her phone from her Playboy shoot. She also showed me some pics from when she dated Mark Stoermer from The Killers (insane). Her phone was out so I used this as an excuse to procure her number. 

The social proof was intoxicating. A random girl actually walked up to me and whispered in my ear ""you need to do ANYTHING this girl tells you to do tonight."" [quick aside: I was a bit annoyed. I think the subtext is ""this girl looks too pretty for you."" Her comment actually threw me off a lot]

We made plans to hang out Tuesday night. I'm pretty sure she'll flake (it's been happening a lot to me lately) but who cares? It was such an awesome experience and I feel godlike right now.

* 'That's a strange noise your phone made. Is it an iPhone?'
* 'Do you know where the social science building is?' (twice)
* 'Could you hold my place in line while I get some water. --&gt; (upon return), what is that phone? It looks like an iPhone, but really, really old'

In each case, the goal was just to start a conversation. From that point, I gauged whether they were interested in the fact that I was talking to them, and continued when I saw interest. 

(That last point may be controversial. I wasn't looking so much for IOIs as much as absence of indicators of disinterest in talking to me, such as immediately turning away once the information was given.)

Two of those resulted in dates, the other responded, and the first line was today, so it's too soon to say.

I've tried direct approaches too. They can work, but they're high pressure. These lines are something even the greenest beginner can say.

If you're on here, reading theory, making excuses, not approaching....STOP. Just say hi to her. Say the first thing that comes to mind. Ask for fake directions, the time, whatever. Just say something, and you'll improve.

**Pro Tip:** Ditch the headphones. They distract you from your surroundings, and introduce a barrier to saying hi. I almost never approach if I'm listening to music, kills spontaneity.

Don't worry about her headphones. If you grab a girl's attention, she'll remove them. Wait till she does, then start speaking. Just stop her the way you would if you were asking someone directions. (I actually practiced this by asking for fake directions)

**Second Tip:** If you're in a prolonged situation (sitting by her in a cafe, waiting in line, etc.) ask her to do something for you. With the first girl in the cafe, I had previously asked her to watch my stuff while I went to the bathroom. It's a small request, but it can have pretty big effects:

1. She's now aware of you. When you later start a conversation, you're not just some stranger she has to assess.
2. She's already committed to doing something for you. This will subconsciously raise your value in her mind.

**Edit:** The point of this is to say the first thing you notice about her, or think of saying. You might be able to come up with something better later....when the moment passes. Not useful. 

Girls don't really care how you start conversations. And the more conversations you have, the more women you'll find that are attracted to you. 

There was a time when I would have failed with any of those lines. But as a result of trying stuff, I got better, and now I can have a good conversation with a random opener about her phone.

1346302706.0,191,self.seduction,z29jc,Stuff I wish I knew when a was a freshman: My college mini tip-list (Also applicable in many other scenarios). ,227,36,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/z29jc/stuff_i_wish_i_knew_when_a_was_a_freshman_my/,"I feel like there might be a good amount of guys here who just moved in/are getting used to talking to girls at college, and being a senior I've learned a lot (in and outside the classroom!) and I'd like to share some stuff that I find useful/effective on campus. 

* As is with everything, it gets easier with practice. I used to stress about approaching a random girl, but it's gotten to the point where I don't even think about it. Just keep talking to people, girls in specifically. We're creatures of habit, and if you're just so used to talking to anyone, talking to girls is easy. **Anxiety/nervousness will leave you VERY quickly, in fact much quicker than you think.**

* Don't think that the only time to flirt/meet/hang out with/hook up with girls is on Friday and Saturday nights. I fell into this trap for a bit and it cost me a girl I really liked. Everyone in college runs on more or less the same schedule. If you like a girl, call her on a random Wednesday and say let's hang out or watch a movie. Ask girls (especially random ones from class) to lunch. You're probably gonna be both eating at the same place anyway. Girls like spontaneity, if you ask me. 


* Sit next to the pretty girls in class, especially big lecture halls. Chat them up. Small talk is easy as hell right now. (""Have you had this professor before?"", ""What other classes are you taking?""). Again, practice makes perfect. Walk in, find the cutest girl there and sit next to her. 

* You can't go out (especially to parties) thinking there's some magical combination of words that makes a girl like you. Girls view you as a whole. Be interesting, be charming, dress well/get in shape (both will increase the quality of your life quite a bit), smile at her, joke/tease her, touch her (lower back area is a favorite of mine), and just **BE YOURSELF**. I guess this applies anywhere. Think less, do more. 

* Okay, realized that last point was super vague. I guess what I mean is to **be comfortable in your own skin**. You can visibly see when a guy's nervous or uncomfortable. To avoid this, keep good posture (my secret to this is trying to stick my collarbone out oh-so-slightly. It pulls my chin up and shoulders back slightly), smile often and keep eye contact (absolutely essential), and be happy to be where you are. Assume she's interested and go from there.

This is how.,241,54,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ko2ti/how_do_i_get_this_one_girl_this_is_how/,"r/Seduction, r/AskSeddit, and r/UniSeddit are saturated with posters asking how to ""approach this girl who I have a class with"" or how to make ""this girl I'm friends with see me sexually,"" and other questions for how to get with a specific girl in a specific scenario and set of circumstances.

So I want to reiterate the first item in the FAQ:

&gt;**How do I get this one girl?**

&gt;You don't. Seduction can only help you become more attractive to women in general, and cannot cause one specific girl to reciprocate your feelings. This is known in the community as having ""one-itis"", and when you have it, game will be pointless.

&gt;[...] There is no saving you, as long as you have the mindset that there is only one girl for you in the whole world.

Get it? You get that girl by being the type of guy who attracts lots of other girls. And at that point, you probably won't really want that one so much. To reiterate Mouthpiece:

&gt;Hi, marvinlevoneast. We're Seddit. Pleased to make your acquaintance. It seems like you've never met us before… please read all the sidebar materials and go back and read some of the previous posts about ""How do I get this girl?""—all of which, in essence, explain that you don't.

&gt;You develop the skills to get girls, in general, that you meet who don't already think of you as the AFC friend they're not really interested in, but are a fresh slate you can write your name on in big, bold letters.

&gt;**There's only one real reason you want that girl. It's because you haven't developed the skills yet to meet thousands of other girls, many of whom will be even better, and you still think that this one girl is the only girl in your life you could ever love.**

&gt;You're wrong. You're dead wrong. And because you're afraid of meeting other girls, you're drawn to the convenience of the one you already know. You've fooled yourself into thinking you've built a foundation with this girl, instead of dug yourself into a hole.

&gt;Get out. Start fresh. Lurk here for a while and read before you ask the single question that comes along every six days or so.

&gt;And then go out and meet a thousand other girls who are better than this girl with whom you've spent the last seven years erasing any opportunity of romance until you entirely rebuild yourself from the ground up.

Let's eliminate ""how should I proceed with this girl?"" posts (and give them no traction by not answering them), to make room for the type of discussion we're here for: **getting better at picking up women.**

1303804443.0,193,self.seduction,gxmjn,Lessons learned from 1st game-driven relationship,243,50,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gxmjn/lessons_learned_from_1st_gamedriven_relationship/,"Hi Seddit, I've been lurking for a couple of weeks now and finally decided to register and contribute.

Recently I had a breakup with a solid HB8, who I'll call Alice--the first woman I ever got through game, and the first relationship I've been in since learning about game. It was passionate but short-lived, but I wanted to share with you what I learned from it.

**Know what to watch for** (success #1)

A friend of mine invited me to a happy hour. Alice was there, and I showed up tired, having spent my weekend watching half of season 4 and all of season 5 of the Wire. The character Marlo had gotten into my head, and I was inadvertently using his mannerisms. I was reclined, hands in my pockets, saying very little, just listening and only contributing to conversation when I really had something to say. Because I had read Mystery's book, I was able to read her IOI's. I told her I was learning Latin dances, which gave her an excuse to ask for my number so we could meet up to Salsa, or, as she added, ""just to hang out."" On the way out the door, I said ""I'll see you around,"" intentionally not asking for her number, and making her stop me and say ""wait-!"" I practiced my Latin dance moves for another week and half before calling her. I was truly in the right frame of mind about her: she could have me on my time, on my terms.

**Not being on Facebook=DHV** (success #2)

As we parted that first night she asked if I was on Facebook. I said ""no, I have no use for it."" She looked taken aback. Later I found out she admired this and saw it as a mark of my independence. I told her that was good, because I didn't care for people who disapproved of my decision to be off the grid. This is a great platform from which to qualify/disqualify a woman too.

**Make her wait** (mistake #1)

We connected on the first date and kissed. The second date we made out like high schoolers and her shirt came off. The third date we had sex. This was in the span of 4 days. Within 10 days of that, we were exclusive. I was smitten by her and she wanted me as a boyfriend, so this didn't seem like an issue. But what I realized in the weeks to ensue was that committing to quickly was a big DLV. I should have made her demand to know if I was her boyfriend, but I probably came off as eager. Also, the rapid timeframe didn't allow enough time for me to qualify her and demonstrate the case for my interest in her. The dynamic of the relationship changed after committing. She became more demanding and I became less independent. We acted entitled to each other and our expectations were too high.

**Don't get complacent** (mistake #2)

As I became more devoted to her, I stopped running game altogether. I shared things I shouldn't have. I stopped being mysterious and stopped thinking about how my words and actions would influence her attraction towards me. I became a completely open book, went with the flow of whatever she wanted, and I never pursued my own interests and social relationships at the expense of my nascent relationship with her.

**Avoid serious conversations** (mistake #3)

Alice wanted to know what the future held for us. I might be leaving the country for two years this summer. Our conversations about the future came way too soon, and also gave me ample opportunities to shoot myself in the foot by sharing my reservations about monogamy and marriage. Instead I barrelled head on into these minefields, killing attraction, supplanting what could have been fun times with heavy conversation, and making her question our long term compatibility. 

**Be measured in expressing your affection** (mistake #4)

Naturally a hopeless romantic and beta male, I told her everything I felt about her. It would have been fine had I been more measured about it, or maybe teased her sometimes about how I just wasn't quite sure about her. Today I read an article someone posted here on this topic. A social psychologist who I have read before did a study showing that [women are more attracted to men who are ambivalent about their feelings](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110207142623.htm#). When I vocalized my feelings for her, I made her heart skip beats--but at the cost of taking her off of her toes a little too much. 

**Remember the testing never stops** (mistake #5)

She would talk about men she had met or hung out with in the past who were rich and ""gorgeous"" and throw other tests at me. These were great opportunities to show her I didn't give a damn about her preferences in men, or what other men had that I didn't. But I do give a damn and sometimes I'd let on. I would say that I was scoring a C or C- on the whole. I only realized near the end that what I thought was her being crappy at conversation was actually her testing my confidence.

**Don't compromise yourself** (mistake #6)

We split a bottle of wine on our first date. I hadn't drank for more than a month, and was working out 6 times a week and eating impeccably well. Over the two months to follow, I would gradually start drinking more and more with her, eating rich meals, and making it to the gym less and less. She was hot but didn't ever work out, she drank much more than me, she smoked, and was altogether not committed to physical self-improvement the way I was. But I let her habits influence me, and only now am I finally getting back to my old positive habits--but I have an extra quarter inch around my waist and a rekindled fondness for booze and fatty food to contend with.

**Don't tell her your ""number""** (mistake #7)

This one is huge. One time, she asked me, ""are you a manwhore?"" This was about 5 weeks after the first date. I flatly said ""no, I don't think so. I suppose you'd have to define it."" She says, ""over or under 20 partners?"" I laughed and said ""oh, under! I've only had 12."" I had a golden opportunity to amuse her, be cocky and mysterious, or even coyly suggest that I truly was some casanova--but the straightforward response I gave her not only squandered that opportunity, but somehow turned her off. 

**Don't go soft** (mistake #8)

After a few weeks with her, I noticed women were looking at me differently. I had lost weight and put more muscle on my upper body, and I was projecting enormous confidence. At the gym, a girl in a lyotard (!) with eclectic tattoos just straight up hit on me. I merely made some flirty banter at her and deliberately avoided escalating. Another time, a smoking hot black girl looked long and hard at me running on the treadmill in my red Chairman Mao shirt, and I didn't even bother to talk to her. A hot blonde eyefucked me sore, and it turned out we were parked right next to each other--but I said nothing. All for the sake of being the good boyfriend, I avoided valuable opportunities to engage with women just for practice. Of course, this was before I saw the end coming.

**See the end coming** (success #3)

Two weeks before the end, Alice started acting mean and bitchy. She seemed to be looking for things to fight about, then we would fight, and she would use it as an opportunity to voice her concern that we had communication problems. I picked up on what she was doing: she wanted to make things hard for me so that I would initiate the breakup. Years ago, a girl pulled this one on me. But I wouldn't let Alice make me pull the trigger when I wasn't even holding the gun. I voiced my optimism about the relationship, tried to avoid and defuse petty conflicts, and refused to reward her bitchiness with my attention. But I knew the days were numbered, so I started lining up other prospects and thinking outside the relationship.

**Rebound fast and hard** (success #4)

She broke up with me on a Sunday morning. It took her an hour and a half because I adamantly refused to do the deed, and at one point I even told her that if she wanted to break up, she would have to do it. Immediately after it was done, we had sex, which I regret. I left and felt very upset, even though I knew this was for the best. As I drove away, a girl I had been working on for several days, who I'll call Mika, called me up. She wanted to hang out, and I found out she also needed a ride to the airport the next morning, as she was leaving the country to do scientific research in the jungle for 3 months. I picked her and her luggage up later that evening and we had sex four times that night. She flew to South America the next morning. Losing Alice sucked, but Mika is amazing, and having her made the breakup considerably more bearable.

**Don't look back** (mistake #9)

Later that night, me and a friend went out and got incredibly drunk. I was extroverted and having a great time. Alice called me just to say hi. She was still into me--I knew she was ambivalent about her decision. So the next night I went to see her. She was surprised when I told her that the breakup was for the best because we didn't have enough in common. We started making out, and then she started asking pointed questions about whether I had been with anyone else. I said it wasn't her business. She asked me if I had slept with someone, and having done nothing wrong, I simply told her yes. Alice knew it was Mika and this particularly upset her because she knew Mika and I had gone out for drinks a couple of weeks prior--which she had permitted but was uneasy about. She went from shocked, to angered, to anguished and in tears in the span of three minutes. Then she told me to leave and to not call or text her. I regret going back to see her, and I realize it was because I had been secretly hoping that she might have changed her mind. 

The whole thing lasted just 10 weeks, but it was significant because I got into it with game, lost it for lack of game, and also it was the first relationship I've had since a breakup a year and a half ago that shook my world and got me reading about game in the first place.

It's very direct.

Optional: works better if you have a wing who is ready for this, but you can point at anyone in the place

You: ""Hey, you see my friend over there in the _____ shirt?""
[You point at your wing, who waves sheepishly. OR, if you're alone, just point at some guy who's in clear sight of both of you and looking sort of towards your direction. Now, you've done two things with this opener: you've opened her, and by human instinct she's gonna look at this guy and as she looks back at you, she will think: ""Another f*cking AFC over there trying to send his buddy over cause he's a pussy.""]

Her: [maybe rolling her eyes, slightly annoyed, whatever] Yeah?

DELIVERY IS KEY WITH THIS. LOOK HER STRAIGHT IN THE EYE, and BE A MIX OF PLAYFUL AND SERIOUS.

You: [smiling, looking directly into her eyes, speaking loudly, from the gut] ""Yeah, he wants to know if you think *I'M* cute."" You can point at yourself when you say ""I'm"" to help illustrate the point, but if you do, smile harder, with a silly kind of look. 

Now, you've instantly turned everything over on it's head. Your first line not only got her attention, it disqualified you as a suitor - after all, you're just a confident guy there to do his AFC friend's bidding! As soon as you deliver your second line of the opener, it's all flipped around. (You gotta flip that shit, Larry!) You're all of a sudden a direct opening confident guy who knows exactly how to get a rise out of a woman - you've brought her from the emotion of ""uggh, not again, more AFCs after me"" INSTANTLY to ""damn, this guy has serious balls, and I'm totally surprised and excited.""

Even when the girl has not heard my second line (bar is loud, which is really me not being loud enough), when I say it in her ear with the right tone, it gets the same response - every time.

Tell me if you guys think this is accurate. Would love to hear some discussion about this and opinions on the opener itself.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1353712739.0,,,True,t3_13oozi,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/13oozi/is_this_a_good_opener_from_a_semiafcstill_total/,

You have to escalate, especially in 1-on-1 situations and even without any IOIs. Even if you won't proceed, you won't be set back, you just need to slow down.**

**The Dark Age**
-----
I am a 24 yr old virgin, who at age 18 was:

* dumped by a girlfriend that I never f-closed after 2 yr relationship, which well, f*** me up considerably;
* started extremely hard studies from which I was almost thrown out;
* got verbally abused to unbearable levels by my mother which suffered from some kind of schizophrenia. I was living only with her, because my parents divorced and rest of my family escaped the flat.

Such state of things put me into 2 years of depression during which I thought daily about suicide.

After one year, at age 19, in the middle of depression, I miraculously managed to not get thrown out of my studies and finally escaped my mother with the help of rest of my  family. Switching flats every couple of months, I concentrated fully on studying.

4 years later I managed to catch-up with my studies and work, but started to suffer from severe case of [involuntary celibacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_celibacy): for 5 years I had no romantic closeness with any girl whatsoever. I was repeatedly ignored, friend-zoned, ridiculed, manipulated and considered a creep/stalker.

However, I have a soul of a warrior so I thought to myself:

*CHALLENGE ACCEPTED*

When nearing completion of my studies I went on a student exchange program. This boosted my confidence considerably and my numerous efforts at girls started to finally bring some fruits. I still got miserable results and often got very strong depression strokes, but at least some girls shown genuine interest in me.

**Becoming Alpha**
-----
I started to work out, jog and maintain strict nutrition. After about 8 months, I looked MUCH better, got huge confidence boost and I met a great guy who pointed me to seddit. I learned about kino escalation, shit tests, traits of alpha male etc. I started doing cold approaches. Having wide arms + knowing the tricks of the trade made THE difference. In my social circles I managed to seduce all girls I was interested in. They were begging me to kiss them, kissing me without asking or inviting on 1-on-1 to their room. However, for various reasons, like cluelessness or lack of clearly defined goals, I didn't scored or didn't even got a proper romantic k-close.

**From approach to the meeting**
-----
After about 15 cold approaches and 5 #-closes, one day I approached a girl on a bus stop with ""Nice mascot you have there. Hi, I'm &lt;name&gt;"" Got very positive reaction from the outset and #-closed her after riding a bus with her for only 3 bus stops. Armed with basics of text game I got some very positive texting going, but still got flaked. However, after two days or so I met her by accident on the bus, talked with her a bit and ended conversation with words ""so, should I give up on you or should I call you?"" ""you can write me an email"".

We started emailing with some really sexual frame of ""challenges"" going on, like

&gt; If you want to know anything about me, you will have to pass my challenges. I will calibrate them to you, but the more playful you are, the more interesting the challenges will get. I hope you won't disappoint me.

after positive responses from her (e.g. ""I hope I won't disappoint you and pass your challenges...  I am bit scared, but if you'll guide me, I will make it... I hope"") the dirty talk ramped up:

&gt; You have absolutely nothing to worry about. Before I will put the harder challenges into you, I will make sure you are prepared with some warm-up challenges. You will enjoy this, but you know this already.

One really funny thing about this email game was that I was framing myself as the dominating sexually-experienced male while in reality I was a virgin and she was framing herself as a scared clueless girl, while it turned out later to be completely to the opposite.

Finally we set up for a meeting at 7 pm, about two weeks after my approach.

**The meeting**
-----

I got a plan to kiss her in the neck at the very beginning but got confused by the fact that she didn't arrived by bus, but instead some guy gave her a lift with his car. However, I tried to maintain dominant frame: ""OK, first challenge, hold my hand. It sounds easy, but it isn't. As long as you are holding it, you can ask me questions"". She went for it. We walked 10 minutes straight into my flat. Before entering it I hugged her and made an attempt to kiss her, but she dodged it. We sat and talked a bit. I started to caress her arms and legs but she got very locked embryo-like body position. To break the ice I started to tease her about her locked body language, give her commands like ""turn around, I will massage you"" or ""ok, take your blouse off, its hot here"" (she had shirt underneath) and joke ""Damn, I don't know what to do next. In my book on seduction this knowledge is on chapter 8, I finished at 7. Damn, I knew I should've read it yesterday"". She went for all my commands and started moving around my room being curious about various stuff. When she kneeled to look at my exercise mat I grabbed her and we started to wrestle on the floor, then the couch, then bed.

We continued a bit rape-like wrestling, interrupted from time to time with textbook shit tests like:

* Are you doing it often with other girls? **Answer:** Every day! All right, I will change the answer until you find it plausible. Every second day. No? Every third day? I cannot tell you! Every seduction material tells I cannot answer you!
* So you really thought it is going to happen today? **Answer:** Well, of course I will try to have sex with you, but the idea is we both have to have fun!
* So it is only about my body! *dresses up and wants to leave the flat* **Answer:** No! *I throw her at the couch and do heavy qualification by talking about my past, then making her talk about hers*.

I also threw in from time to time a decent joke which always made her laugh
&gt; *While she was rubbing against me half dressed* So, this is the trial version?

&gt; *Her colleague texted her and she was texting back* Why are you texting NOW? Ah, your friend is worried about you? *I make a really surprised and confused look* But why?

&gt;...no no, I am not afraid of your ex-boyfreind! I am considering intimidating him. It's hard to intimidate somebody twice as big as myself, you know. That's why I am asking.

&gt;You can... teach me a lot? Oh God *gasp* *gasp* OK take a deep breath.

&gt;But of course I want to have sex with you, I am a man, why are you acting so surprised?

&gt;Tell me if I am doing it right, I am using my knowledge from 7 years ago, you know.

&gt;Damn, but I read on the net that girls who bite happen only to experienced seducers!

&gt;What, you can eat as much as you like and you don't get fat? Get out!

&gt;So you eat so much and then sleep a lot? Its surely to feed these *touch her huge breasts*.

Before the qualification it was really hard to kiss her or undress - lots of rape-like wrestling (I loved the freeze-up breaks  when she took off her glasses, put them away, and then we resumed the ""rape""). After qualification the bra went off almost by itself, we did a lot of kissing, I took care of her breasts and after a while she said ""so you are a virgin... but I am experienced and I can teach you a lot. Just relax"" and I got a BJ-close + a bit of bite marks. She was adamant about not undressing her down ""not on the first time"". I walked her home.

**Remarks**
-----

So yea, I talked a lot about my seduction attempts, about other girls ""Oh my god! I have a bite mark from you, so what I am going to do when I try to sleep with other girls?"" ""Well, then you will have something to talk about!"", and about her ex-boyfriend. Theoretically textbook mistakes, but I kept my ultra-positive, relaxed and confident mind frame so it played out well in the end. Other important things to remember:

* Don't know what to do? Just caress her, joke and command her around. Even if she won't go for it, you lost nothing, you just need to proceed more slowly.
* Consider everything a shit test. As stated on [wiki on Sperm Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_Wars)

&gt;But finally, the only real test a woman can set is whether a man can negotiate and overcome her own defenses. To test this, she has to resist first verbally, then physically. The stronger and more realistic her resistance, the better the test.

Keep this in mind all the time. She once even said ""Damn, you are stronger than I expected"" which just reminded me of this sentence and made me laugh out loud.

**The aftermath: F-close**
-----
Not much to say here. The F-close happened two days later, again at my place, after some all-in texting like ""Ah and btw: I want to fuck you. Yours, &lt;my name&gt;"".

I acted coy, I didn't feed a bunch of info about myself. I just hint, in a sexy/flirty way about questions these girls ask me and my responses have to have increased by 60%. Like Chase (the author) says: make them work to get to know you. Make them Chase you. Shorter sentences that are leading. The shorter the msg and the longer you wait to reply (not too long), the better. And tease! One girl just said: ""Wow, you're a lucky guy. Omg, shutup!"" - I replied ""Calm down now. ;) Don't push your luck :P"" and she replied ""hahahaha :) fine fine"" ---  Don't be afraid to be a little cocky. They love it.. and also, one liners seem to work. If you use plenty of fish, okcupid or whatever, try something like I do (it seems cheesy, but it totally catches their eye) [Subject Line: Do you have a BandAid?] - [Body: I just scraped my knee falling for you.]. Better than, ""hey... sup?"" Also! Don't supplicate them. One girl wanted to chat on AIM. I said, ""Aim hurts my head, download yahoo."" 20 min later she made an account, tracked me down and msg'd me. Make them chase you!

**Overcoming approach anxiety:**

http://www.girlschase.com/content/overcoming-approach-anxiety

A few of my favorite **quotes** from his blog posts are:

&gt;When I was first training myself up as a persistent guy, it helped me to imagine myself as a Latin or Italian man romancing some ravishing belle. In America, men are trained not to be pushy, so we’re much more hands off and if a woman says, “No, I have to get up early tomorrow,” we just accept it and back down, even if that’s not what she wanted us to do. Can you picture a Latin man or an Italian man letting it stand at just one refusal?

&gt;Italian: Come with me, bella donna!

&gt;Girl: Alas, I cannot, I must rise early tomorrow.

&gt;Italian: Oh, okay.

**and**

&gt;""But the thing is -- that anger and insult is terribly misguided. Because it isn't you that a woman's rejecting -- it's your approach to her, your presentation of yourself, how you come across in that split second when she's first assessing you."" It's not you. It's your game.

**or**

&gt;""Eventually some of the pieces started coming together. I learned to talk about myself a lot less and get girls talking about themselves much more. It didn't make much sense at first, but I couldn't dispute the fact that women seemed to be more interested in me when I told them fewer cool things about myself, and just focused on exuding coolness and sexiness without talking about it.""

**or**
(my favorite)
&gt;""The only time the nice guys actually get the girl is when she’s finally had her fill of bad boys and decides that it’s time to settle down with a nice guy who will take good care of her. The bad boys enjoy her when she’s young and vivacious, and the nice guys get the leftovers. The nice guys do get the girl – they do finish – it’s just that they finish last. Like the cliché.""  -------- .... ""Your standard, run-of-the-mill nice guy, however, is not nice because he’s a legitimately warm-hearted soul, like those strong men we just mentioned. Instead, he’s nice because he’s **scared**. He’s scared that if he comes off as too assertive, or too aggressive, or too masculine, he will frighten women away and lose them. So he acts sweet and kind and gentlemanly and slow in an effort to not scare off women. And, in the end, all he scares off is their attraction."" --- ..... ""Do you think, for one moment, that had she told him, “Well, I’m just looking to hook up,” he would’ve said, “Oh, no thank you.” Of course not! I’m willing to bet you a hundred dollars that the entire reason he told her he was looking for a serious relationship was because that’s what he thought she wanted to hear - he probably thought it was the “safest bet” at getting her. I’m sure he’s a great guy, but when a man dances around like this and tries to act like he’s not interested in sleeping with women fast, it kills attraction. Just like it did here. Other men, who weren’t so timid about their intentions, got to sleep with my ex. But this poor nice guy didn’t (at least so far as I know!).""

**and**

&gt;""Oh, and as for how to act technically when a girl rejects you? Shrug. Laugh. Pretend to cry. Smack a mildly amused grin on your face and shrug your eyebrows, as if to say, ""Does this girl really understand what she just missed out on?"" (my personal favorite). Then go get back on the saddle and meet some more girls.""

**last but not least**

&gt;""Actively approaching women is like that – you must commit yourself to making it through those first 12 weeks. It’s one of the toughest, most intimidating things you can do for most guys – but it’s also going to be one of the most rewarding. If you want women in your life, you need to go out and get them. They aren’t going to come to you; it doesn’t work that way.""

1341793067.0,187,self.seduction,w8ss9,WHY YOU SHOULD FORGET ABOUT IOIs,252,65,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/w8ss9/why_you_should_forget_about_iois/,"Like most momentous discoveries, e.g. in science, the advent of the original, now old-school, Mystery Method, was a double-edged knife.

On one hand, it contained many brilliant insights into female psychology, game and social dynamics. A lot of what we do today still owes enormously to that base.

On the other hand, it tends to be regarded by many as gospel, even the parts that have been since improved upon.

One example is the so-called IOI (indicator of interest). The idea that women do certain gestures (grooming, etc.) when they are attracted to you. 

The problem came with the application. According to old-school Mystery Method, you should wait til the woman shows IOIs, and ONLY THEN start probing deeper for reasons to like her. In any case, your interest is never shown BEFORE HERS.

This idea is still pervading, although in many cases it is not the most effective and can often be counter-productive. There are several problems with that approach, the biggest of which is that signals from the girl are not the most reliable read-out.

Sure, some girls will show obvious interest and even be aggressive when sufficiently attracted. But by waiting for signals to make moves, you'll lose a lot of opportunities and move too slowly most of the time. What's worse, you'll blow it with the hotter girls, who often show subtle or no signs, even when attracted.

The only true test of the interaction is compliance. If you try to move/touch/sexualize/qualify and she lets you, that's all you need. No ""invitation"" required.

It's easy for a girl to just stand there and smile while you spit out jokes, it doesn't require any investment from her. But if u escalate the interaction physically, logistically (e.g. move her) or emotionally (e.g. qualify), now she's forced to make a decision. ""Do I like him enough?""

So think of qualification/touch as a litmus test. Ping her; if she doesn't comply, THEN you know you need to build more value.

This is a key concept. Don't wait for ""permission"" to do something, DO it and THEN adjust your behavior depending on the consequences. This goes for qualification, sexualization, touch, etc. Anything that shows interest.

Think about it. Only someone insecure would wait for a signal or invitation to start showing the interest they felt all along. Would a rock star do that? No. 

If you have hot girls in your life, telling an attractive woman ""you're beautiful"" is run of the mill. It doesnt show weakness or supplication. 

Showing interest IS NOT weakness. That's the misunderstading of classic Mystery Method, and something that has changed in the way we now perform and teach game.

You can show interest in a confident way. Or you can show interest in a needy way. Only the latter is a problem.

On the other hand, hiding interest is ALWAYS a problem. Only someone insecure, or for whom that interaction means a great deal, would ever do that.

Forget about IOIs. Make moves, show interest, and calibrate after.

1339174632.0,188,self.seduction,urt3v,"[FR] Girl Sunning in Park, Lying on Her Stomach ",220,32,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/urt3v/fr_girl_sunning_in_park_lying_on_her_stomach/,"As winter ends and spring rolls around, hot girls flock to parks. It's one of the nicest places to meet women.

I'm in Madison Square Park, New York City. There is a path with benches encircling a center lawn. I'm walking by and I notice this amazing hottie lying in the middle of the lawn on her stomach reading. She's wearing immensely flattering tight, black yoga pants. Her ass looks amazing. Her face looks cute too. She's fairly young, about 22.

Talking to a girl who's standing, sitting, or walking is one thing, but it's been a while since I've hooked a girl who is lying down in the middle of the lawn.

No shame in admitting I'm a bit intimidated.

But that's okay, I simply follow the plan.

The first step is positioning myself near her. Even though I feel a bit apprehensive, I walk over to the vicinity of where she's lying.

I walk as if I'm going past her and  then stop about four feet away from her. I'm not facing her but nor am I facing away. She's off to my side. 

I pull out my phone and look at it.

The next step: Say something.

I decide I am simply going  to ask her my opening question. That's it. And... see where it goes from there.

If she's not responsive, I'm no worse for the wear and I've gotten past my intimidation at talking with women lying in the middle of the lawn.

 ""H-hey"" I say, stuttering a bit. ""Do you know if there's a zoo in Central Park?""

I'm trying not to look at her fabulous ass in those tight, black yoga pants.

 ""There is,"" she responds. ""I've never been there, but I know there's one there.""

""Like, a big one?""

""It's not that big.""

""Okay,"" I say. ""Because I have some friends coming into town and I was thinking about bringing them there.""

""I think it's a good zoo,"" she responds.

""Do you know if they have penguins? Because I've been really in the mood for penguins.""

""I think they have penguins,"" she says.

""Awesome. Maybe I'll hire you as my personal tour guide.""

She laughs.

And then picks up the conversation.

""Where else are you taking them?"" 

This is my invitation to stay longer. You generally won't find a stronger invitation than this.

""I don't know,"" I say. ""There's a lot of stuff up around central park area.""

""Yeah, that's a good area.""

""You know some good spots?"" I ask.

She mentions the Museum of Natural History.

""Isn't there the Museum of Sex?"" I ask. I am purposely injecting sex into the conversation. Somehow talking about sex does a lot of good things. It raises tension and shows I'm not afraid to talk about inappropriate topics.

""That is somewhere near here.""

""Is that any good?"" I ask.

""I've never been there.""

""You're not the type of girl to go to the Museum of Sex?""

""I've never had the opportunity"" she says and laughs. ""I haven't been here that long. Only like a year."" 

Another indicator that she's interested in conversation. Practically setting up the next question I ask.

""Where did you move from?"" I take the bait but then pull it away from her. ""Wait. Don't tell me. Let me guess..."" 

I sit down next to her.

""You moved from... New Jersey!"" I say. She doesn't react so well to my tease.

""I'm just busting on you,"" I say. 

""Maybe with my outfit,"" she says. ""I never wear this. I was just going to gym.""

When a girl acts insecure or says something negative about herself like this, I never jump in and compliment her. A prompted compliment is a sure sign of a nice guy who does things because he feels like he has to.

""I'm from California,"" she continues.

We start getting deeper into conversation, talking about where she grew up. She's asking me questions.

I still tease her a bit, but I'm also giving her more about me, connecting on an emotional level. At one point we are even talking about childhood and growing up.

That's always a good sign.

This girl is sweet and definitely into me. After about 15 minutes, I tell her I need to take off and move to exchange contact info with her.

The grass is a bit wet and I wipe off my pants as I get up.

""My ass is wet from sitting on the ground. Promise me you won't stare at it when I walk away,"" I say.

""I don't think I can keep that promise,"" she says, laughing.

1350405585.0,187,self.seduction,11ks6a,Learn from Drunk You to improve Sober You (crosspost),230,43,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11ks6a/learn_from_drunk_you_to_improve_sober_you/,"This is taken from a comment on 2XC. As a rule, we don't link directly to their subreddit so I've taken the liberty of copy &amp; pasting it. Solid advice.

&gt; Man, all drunk me ever does is stagger around the house bellowing old sea shanties before throwing up all over her bass. (Drunk me is why I don't drink to excess anymore).

&gt; Levity aside, I understand what you're saying. When I was in college, I never drank, and I always secretly envied those who did, because they seemed to be having so much fun. I didn't understand it: they would say things that were either nonsensical or completely obvious, and everyone would roar with laughter and slur something about how hilarious it was. They would flirt and simper with all the subtlety of elephants, and the drunken targets of their affection would lap it up. And I just sat there, sober, shaking my head.

&gt; But as time went on, and I started experimenting a bit with alcohol myself, I learned some of the truth that lurks in the bottle. Simply put: a drunk person is only funny/sexy/endearing to other drunk people; a sober person can be funny and sexy and endearing to anyone.

&gt; Drinking doesn't change who you are. It doesn't make you funny or sexy. All it does is weaken your inhibitions, stripping away the filters that normally separate thoughts from actions. If sober you is witty but shy, drunk you might become the life of the party by voicing all those witty, formerly-private thoughts. If sober you is a passionately sensual creature held back by insecurity about her appearance, drunk you might march out onto the dance floor to flaunt her body to anyone who wants to watch.

&gt; But in both of those cases, drunk you is still you. You're still doing the things you want to do; you're just doing them under the influence of drugs, which makes it easier. Being drunk gives you an excuse: if you go too far, you can laugh it off. ""Yeah, sorry, I was so wasted I didn't even know what I was doing!""
&gt; Drinking is easy. Being an awesome person while drinking is also easy, especially if everyone around you is drinking too. The real challenge, though, is learning how to be awesome without relying on alcohol (or other drugs). Anyone can shake their ass when they're drunk, but it takes a lot of confidence and positive body image to do it sober.

&gt; Don't envy drunk you; learn from her. Let her show you how you want to be, then figure out how you can incorporate that into your sober life. Does drunk you get the crowd laughing by shouting out jokes? Maybe that's a sign that sober you is too meek, and lets people talk over her, so start being more assertive in conversations. Does drunk you enthrall people with her stories? They're your stories, even when you're sober; volunteer them more often!
&gt; Drunk you may be funny and sexy and endearing, but she's just a cartoon. She's an exaggerated version of you, a caricature, all zany big lips and anime eyes.

&gt; Sober you, though? She's the portrait. And she's beautiful.

1334496835.0,186,self.seduction,sar8y,"Tip on ""moving on"" for Noobies, AFCs, and even the occasional experienced guy.",221,35,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/sar8y/tip_on_moving_on_for_noobies_afcs_and_even_the/,"I write this from experience (both success and failure) and observation. 


It is not uncommon to see posts from guys who are frustrated with a particular woman, for whatever reason (and there are 1000s of reasons). They usually want to know (1) what the hell is going on in a particular situation (2) what is she thinking, and/or (3) what should they do about x, y, or z.


And very often, guys with experience will read the situation and say something like, ""It ain't happening, move on."" The advice is often correct and sometimes the questioner does move on, but still very often they do not. ""But what if..."" ""But I really like this one..."" etc. One reason for this hesitancy to take the advice is their lack of experience, which means they have had little exposure to the warning signs and other guys need to point them out, explain why these are a problem, and why he'll be better off forgetting about this woman.


But what is less discussed is what sort of mindframe guys have that lead them to that point in the first place. That is, it is quite possible, and in fact very easy, to avoid getting to that point. The problem is that many, many guys have already set themselves up for frustration, failure, and heartbreak before they ever get started. I'm going to explain to you how to stop that shit in its tracks right now.


Chances are about 95% of your male friends are fucking up in the way I'm about to explain and your exposure to them is only teaching you that this sort of mindset (more below) is normal, natural, and basically unavoidable. That's why guys date awful women, are in awful relationships and marriages, and find their dicks boxed up and on a shelf eventually. Want to avoid all that? Thought so.


The problem is in what you want and prioritize. Yes, we want to get laid, that's not the problem. We even want to date and maybe get into a LTR with a cool woman. That's not the problem. 


Here's the problem: Somewhere along the line (from social conditioning) you've prioritized meeting ""HER"" and maybe once you find ""HER"" even marrying her. It is on your ""to do"" list. --- (a) Go skydiving, (b) Write the great American novel, (c) meet an awesome babe, have great sex, and maybe live the rest of your lives together skydiving and writing novels. You get the picture.


Part of our culture's social validation is being in a long-term relationship. It is viewed as living a successful life, which is bullshit. Just think of how many bad relationships and marriages are out there. How often television, books, movies and so on make fun of shitty couples. We know simply being in a LTR does not equate to success in life but we tend to ACT like it is as a sort of default setting. And the more we act in a particular way the more we trick our brain into believing it (a sort of corollary to many PUA tips).


Now here's why this is fucking you up. Once you've put this on your ""to do"" list as a, say, top 10 priority (or even top 20), you've set yourself up without even knowing it. How's that, you say? Well, think of it this way. You meet a babe, you hit it off, go on some dates, have great sex, it turns into a relationship and then what happens? 


She turns into a nag, a bitch, goes sexually cold, etc. (not all girls do this once in a LTR, but many will). She tries to control you, has jealousy fits, and so on. And what do many guys do?  They stay with her, take her shit, try to fix it, become supplicating pussies, and their balls shrivel up and die. Later, they go to friends and seduction forums on advice on how to deal with it. Heck, they might even get a quick fix for a particular issue, but she'll never respect him, cheat on him/dump later, and he'll try to move on only to later rinse and repeat with the next woman he throws himself at.


The gist of it: When you prioritize meeting women to get into a relationship as one of the ""things to do"" in life, you set yourself up to put up with crap that you should never, ever put up with (I know because I've done it, seen friends do it, read dozens of posts that report on the end results of such behavior, etc.). What happens when you DO NOT prioritize LTR/marriage as a ""thing to do"" in life? You don't take crap, you get rid of needy/naggy/bitchy women rather quick. You don't lead yourself down the road of supplication that ends in the township of misery. You keep your self-respect. You'll be single/without dates a bit more, yes, but there's nothing worse than being worried about pissing your woman off, about having to walk on eggshells because you don't know what will set her off again. Women are great on taking us out of our usual selves and turning us into castrated sniveling wusses. 


Look back on your experiences with women. Has that ever happened to you? If so, why did you put up with it? It was probably because being in a relationship was a priority on your to do list and you wanted to feel you've accomplished checking a few boxes off that list. You fucked up before you even met her.


Now, I'm not against LTRs (been in them and enjoyed quite a few) or even marriage (just not for me). But your approach to women and dating will ADD to your happiness not detract from it if you take meeting ""Ms Right"" off your little list of neediness. You'll live for yourself, do want you want, be independent, make your own rules, and if a woman comes along that wants to be pulled into that world, you can choose to do so, rather than running around like a simpering caffeinated monkey begging her let you into hers.

Now, let's say you just can't give up the ghost. You REALLY DO want to meet Ms Right and settle down for the long-term. Do you want to do that without falling to the traps I've spelled out above? Check out the following link. Go the bottom and read all of Pook's summary of ""Anti-Dump's Machine."" It is written from the point of view of how to screen out girls that will only give you shit and misery and how to screen in the ones that might make a decent long term partner (i.e., it is not about pickup or even seduction per se).

1323238044.0,188,self.seduction,n3ltw,Something about inner game.,230,42,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/n3ltw/something_about_inner_game/,"I would call this a short cut to inner game if it weren't so difficult to implement. If you're looking for short cuts, fuck you anyway, because this is no place for half measures.

I always see advice along the lines of ""fake it till you make it"" that while valid, i think skirts the issue of having no inner game. An alternative or supplement to this is what i am proposing.

Answer me this, how do you see yourself? Do *you* think you are a loser? Honestly, do you see yourself as cool? Put in a better way, do you see yourself as someone worthy of respect? Admiration? It is one thing to tell someone to walk into the room as though he owns it, it is another thing for that person to believe it.

Inner game cannot be a mask you put on when you need it- it doesn't work that way. The moments in our lives when we are most confident are those times when everything is going smoothly- why? Because you know that success with this random girl or not- you are feeling good about yourself and nothing will change that. In essence- you have a safety net. Having multiple prospects serves a similar purpose. 

When your state and confidence does not depend on a successful pick up, you feel freest to approach because the stakes are not high. I am aware this not particularly new or insightful.

The question is, how does one change the way he sees himself? Every single say, there are things we do, i do, you do, that causes us to lose a little respect in ourselves. Some of them can be minor, like succumbing to another scoop of ice cream or being afraid to interrupt a friend whose story has gone on too long when you're in a hurry, some can be major, like chickening out on that backpacking trip or putting up with a job where you get no respect out of fear of the unknown or approaching a girl you like.

It doesn't matter what it is or how big it is, but when it happens, you're brain acknowledges it. You have chosen the cowardly choice, and you loathe yourself for it. You are aware you have diminished yourself- and your self esteem weeps.

""Never lose your self-respect, nor be too familiar with yourself when you are alone. Let your integrity itself be your own standard of rectitude, and be more indebted to the severity of your own judgment of yourself than to all external percepts. Desist from unseemly conduct, rather out of respect for your own virtue than for the strictures of external authority.""

Baltasar Gracian (1601 - 1658)

Hold yourself to a higher standard. I mean your *own* standard. And you know what your standard is- you know the shit you do that makes you feel small and shitty inside. Cut it out. Even if no one notices, cut that shit out of your life. Start small, deadlines, room cleaning, overdue books- whatever. Move gradually onwards- your guide will only be what makes you feel small- let nothing be safe.

I feel practicing inner game only when meeting girls is like holding in your stomach when you pass by a mirror.

Hey guys,

I am in the minority on this website when it comes to sex, I don't place it high in my life. I love sex, it is awesome it is fun, but there are things far more important than sex going on in my life. As a guy that refuses to publicize my private life to the internet I get a lot of static (criticism), on my website, on this forum, on my videos, even on my facebook fan page I've had people say that I was some loser that can't get laid. It really doesn't matter to me that much when someone has animosity toward me and says ""You can't get laid."" Honestly what is the obsession with needing to get laid? People around here measure your value by your sex life, does that really make sense? Don't forget you are full of shit if you don't post field reports, is the mentality.

Go over this in your head one time: What is the attitude of the guy who gets laid a lot in regards to sex? It's NO BIG DEAL, that attitude is a part of his assets when it comes to his ability to get laid. Someone who comes on here and spreads his sex life around, his closing rate, him fucking x girls in x days shows nothing but a lack of confidence and a huge ego. Why do you need to qualify for us? Who the fuck are we that it matters that you got laid x many times in x many days?

I am kind of getting just down right tired of this form of measurement in the community, so many dick measuring contests around here. One of the big reasons I don't post too often on here (in 5 years I have 1100 posts). Everyone has this obsession with the guy who gets laid the most, or being the guy who gets laid the most. The irony of all of it is your obsession with getting laid ultimately works against you, the times when I was in a dry spell were times when I was unhappy and constantly thinking about getting laid. How do I have to approach her? What should I say? Bla Bla Bla - all these bull shit thoughts got in the way of actually getting laid. Why? Because getting laid is easy, it's you that makes getting laid hard. People don't realize getting laid is more about getting out of your own way then doing all the right shit when you have good attractive traits. A woman more easily forgives a man she is attracted to when he makes mistakes throughout courtship.

Rather than worrying about getting laid and forcing things, learn to just have attractive habits (this can be tedious but worth it) and escalate - that's it. Don't worry about getting laid, forcing it and thinking about and only worrying about it won't make you happy. Define what you want and go after that, whether that is to fuck 10 girls, or 100, whether that is to find a wife, a girlfriend, or whatever else. You knowing what you want in your love life will help you birds eye everything.

Happiness thought: Do you think guy A who has fucked 1000 girls is happier then guy B with a wife, 2 kids, and a dog? It all depends on what the guy wanted, the guy who is happiest defines what he wants and goes after it. That's cool you want to fuck 50 girls whatever, but in my experiences when you are running up your numbers you aren't making yourself happier (in fact when I was going through them fast my life was way more stressful). Your actions can make you happy or not but that is up to you. My personal happiness isn't defined by the amount of girls I sleep with, it never will be, perhaps your happiness is linked to fucking 100s of women that is cool too, it's just not for me.

Two things I think a lot of people miss on here are: You obsessing with getting laid won't get you laid, and You getting laid won't make you happy.

Your belt notches don't make you ""The Man"" or happy. You aren't the shit because you fucked 2000 women, you aren't the man from fucking a few drunk women a week. Every fishermen knows if you go fishing every day you catch fish everyday, if you stay out until you hit your quota then you'll get your quota everyday. Similarly once you hit a certain point you can go out on any night in a metropolitan area (need options) and go get laid because getting laid isn't that fucking difficult. Obsessing over getting laid is what makes it difficult.

My next statement plays more off the fishermen thought, each fishermen has his own technique and thus the time it will work, some of us go fishing at night and some of us go fishing during the day. Just because a person doesn't go to the bar every weekend doesn't mean he doesn't get laid. Going to the club isn't the only place to pick up girls. That was another response that has happened multiple times and even recently when I was attacked on here. You probably don't even go out. What the fuck does going out at night have to do with getting laid? Not one fucking thing. SDLs are a lot more difficult than SNL no doubt but you can create a lengthy list of phone numbers and still get laid with regularity by regular every day game. You can collect ""leads""(numbers) to get laid anywhere: I've got numbers at work (co-workers and customers), fast food restaurants, sit down restaurants, bus rides, airplane, and even walking down the street.

So guys stop obsessing about all the bull shit when comes to getting laid, learn some sexual escalation and tension techniques, but focus on yourself and revealing how attractive you are to others.

It's not about getting laid, or club game, or night game, it is about just being happy. Get over your numbers, get over your ego, and get over close rate. Just be happy and attractive, that will get you laid because to anyone that has gotten fair amount of tail getting laid is just NO BIG DEAL. Take on that attitude you'll be happier and more appealing to women.

Peace and Love, Vic

I've struggled with girls forever and since I've been reading and trying to improve, my confidence has increased X10. Thanks for all your help!

Here is the story:
Before I got into this, when I took a girl on a date it would be fun but I would never escalate and would always find myself in the friend zone. So I've been really working on kino and body language. So this night it was my first time meeting this girl. We had a great time on the date and then at the end I went in for the hug at the end. She hugged tight and I got really nervous because I knew I had to make the decision if I was going to kiss her. After the hug I felt that tension everybody talks about so I said to myself, screw it and I went in for the kiss. It wasn't even as awkward as I thought it was going to be.

Background: pulled this girl's # from OKC.  We've been texting back and forth a little, you know, just being playful. Yesterday afternoon I texted her a time and place to meet up for some drinks.  Dialogue to follow:

Me (3:00)- There's a pretty fly place down the street from me called &lt;name&gt;; meet me there around 9:30 for some drinks.

- It got to 8:00 and I hadn't heard back from her so...

Me (8:00)- Hey lover, haven't heard back from you, so I went ahead and made some other plans.  We'll work something out later next week.

Her (11:00)- Sorry I missed you! I was out on the lake all day, and left my phone.  I would love to meet up, don't forget about me ;).

Me (11:15)- Then be unforgettable

Her (11:20)- [sexiest fucking picture; gave me a boner] Unforgettable?

So this kind of solidified a couple of things for me:  
1. girls like challenges; give them to them.
2. Assume the dominant frame.  Stay Chill.  When I hadn't heard back, I cancelled.  When she gave me her excuse, there's was no, ""oh no that's totally fine blah blah.""  I gave her a challenge, and was rewarded with a boner-inducing photo.

When I'm alone with some girls my personality comes out and I shine.  I make them all laugh etc etc.  The trouble is when there are other aggressive guys around.  I get amog'd really badly.  This is so weird to admit but I am intimidated by other males who hold high status in social circles I want to be a part of.  I have a lot of trouble being myself because when I inevitably run into resistance or some bullshitting from other guys I sort of lose my edge and look really f*&amp;%ing beta.. I have some like weird uncontrollable tendency to fear some sort of escalation into conflict with other males.  I never played contact sports, I've never been in a fight, I hate conflict and girls bring it out best when it comes to guys.  That is like my sticking point.  God this sounds so so lame but its an issue for me.  

Has anyone ever dealt with something like this?  Also this may help.  I've always been a sort of goofy guy.  Rather than trying to rid my whole being of this I've decided its sort of who I am and that I want to make it work.  The problem here is that while babes in my experience think this built guy who's also a bit nerdy and goofy is rather endearing, amogs find it very easy to try and knock me down and kill my mojo.   




EDIT:  Wow I just came back and this thread blew up over night.  Thanks a lot of all of the replies guys I read everything! Martial arts seemed to be a pretty common recomendation and I'll look into it for sure.  I can see how some controlled fighting would help me gain some perspective.  I probably wouldn't be too bad at it either I'm about 6'1"" 185 lean ;).  Someone also mentioned watching ESPN which I never thought about because sports aren't my thing but watching the people on the channel could be worth my while.

Had I known the thread would get so much attention I probably would have expanded a little more.  I used to be a fat kid, picked last, got thrown in a trash can when I tried to join the football team :0. I totally became the little angsty alpha hating skate rat untill age 19. I have never ever gotten along with ""alpha males."" Part of my seddit experience once I got to college was to lose weight (lost 60 lbs) and then gain some muscle (gained about 15 to 20 lbs).  So now not to be cocky but I look pretty damn good, and there is some potential for me to intimidate other people which brings me to whats going on.  I guess I sort of appear alpha to someone who hasn't met me.  I'm real big on eye contact and body language (thanks seddit) but I just haven't really internalized most of this yet.  It's not so much a physical confrontation that bothers me (although with some people this is the case) its the little shit tests I get from guys a lot.  And then once I fail its almost like some of these guys try their absolute hardest to stroke their egos at my expense.  It's little things, like disagreeing with all of my opinions and trying to make me look weak etc.  This is a distinct weakness of mine. This sort of thing has been going on for years and honestly I really don't think the women present when this happens realize whats going on; I just begin to look weak to them. I thought I could circumvent the issue by getting better with women but like someone in this thread mentioned I have to learn to seduce these alpha bros a little.  My problem is really reasserting and maintaining my dominant frame; letting these guys know that I am also alpha. Like back in the day I still have a tendency to slip into a validation seeking spot once this stuff goes on and everything just goes to shit. 

This is definitely an inner game issue and I recognize that but it's also something I just hate as well.  I hate ""getting into it"" with these people but they are unavoidable if I want to be around high status girls.  I hope this makes sense as I just rambled a good bit but know that already I've gotten some great insight from this thread.  Thanks again seddit.

This list I wrote may help some of you out.

* If you're talking to a cashier and she tells you for any reason when she gets off work, she wants you to come back.

* If a girl gives you her number, on some level she is interested. Meaning she gives it to you without you prompting her first, though often if she gives it to you after you ask her it still means she's interested

* If a girl repeatedly mentions how she wishes she had a nice guy to date, she is interested.

* If a girl asks about your relationship status out of the blue, she is interested.

* If a girl you don't know approaches you and asks for the time, but then lingers in your vicinity, she wants you to come back up and approach her because she is interested.

* If a girl who is not a best friend type suggests watching a movie when you two are hanging out alone, she wants something to happen. She is interested.

* If a girl says she ""needs to talk to you"", but then it ends up being something really stupid like ""I don't know what colour to dye my hair"", then she probably chickened out of telling you she likes you.

* Physical touching while a girl is having a conversation with you usually means she is interested.

* Any time a girl seems to giggle WAY more than she should during a conversation, it means she is interested.

* If a girl you're not very close friends with mentions the fact she broke up with her ex and is looking for 
someone new, by God make a move! She is interested. This could mean it's just a rebound relationship, but nonetheless she's interested

* A girl almost never talks about wanting a one night stand to a guy unless she wants to with him. (This is more on the topic of sex than dating, but I thought I'd include it anyway)

* This one blows my mind that some guys miss! If a girl asks to sit next to you somewhere where there are other viable empty places/tables to sit at, she's interested!

* If a girl starts talking about ""how well you two get along"", she is interested in you.

* If a non-best friend girl is with her friends and ditches them to hang out with you, she is interested in you.

* If a girl tells you she's lonely at home (by means of text, E-Mail, FaceBook, phone, etc. etc.), she wants you to come over! She most likely is interested in you!

* If a girl says she's really cold in an obviously warm environment, she probably wants you to warm her up (either through a hug or occasionally offering your jacket chivalrously). She's interested in you.

* If a girl starts complaining about how all the guys just want her for sex, and that she wishes she had a sweet guy, she's interested in you. However, I can't guarantee she'd really be the type most guys would want to date. At the same time, this can be one of the few less obvious hints, where she is testing how you react and judging your answer to see if you're someone she's interested in.

* If a girl says she's ""new in town"" and wants someone to show her around, nine times out of ten it's because she's trying to find an excuse to be around you one on one.

* If a girl seems to be smiling with you way more than she does when she talks to other people, she's interested in you.

* I know it's cliche, but a lot of girls still twirl their hair when flirting. Girls usually stop doing this by the time they're 21.

* A girl who keeps beating herself up on her looks, not only is she fishing for a compliment, she's fishing for YOUR compliment. Though this usually means she's interested in you, she could just be looking for attention. If she does it often to multiple people, it's probably the latter.

* In most contexts, if a girl asks you how her outfit looks, she wants you to check her out. She is interested in you.

* If a girl talks about how long she spent getting ready and then asks your opinion on how she looks, she did it to impress you. (If she does this when you and her had specifically made plans to hang out, it's even more explicit. Exceptions to this rule are weddings, parties, etc. etc.)

* Girls like confidence. If you think a girl is interested in you, go for it! The worst that happens is a no. If she has a worse reaction, she's someone you wouldn't want to be around anyway.

* If a girl is constantly leaving you to talk very briefly to her other female friends, then runs back to you to talk more. She is interested in you and is filling them in on all the details. This is especially true if it's accompanied by a lot of smiling.
Disclaimer: It's impossible to know if these are always true in every situation, but from my experience they are true. Please don't shoot me in the face if some turn out not to work for you.

I had a straight up serious case of onenitis and I was basically crawling into a shell of desperation and desire for this one girl. In my head I was thinking ""the one girl that actually liked me left me, now how am I gonna be able to get other girl if I'm shy, don't know how to approach, and will run out of things to say."" I was basically bathing in my own self pity and knew I needed to change.  I found r/seduction by chance and started to read everything this badass sub had to offer. This sub definitely helped me manage my onenitis with that girl, and it helped me realize my that I'm one badass motherfucker when I want to be.

Now that takes us to today. Lately I have been going out to the local bars and have been trying out my new found confidence on some of the ladies, and boy have I seen some results. Last week I went out on a sarge mission with one of my good buddies. I was on one that night...ngaf about results and was just looking to have a good time and chat up some women. I ended up number closing two girls that night(fuck ya). The next night I went out, and disaster struck...My ex was out and she was on a mission to get my attention. She kept trying to talk with me one-on-one, I said fuuccckkk that, and did what I wanted to do(have fun, and chat up some ladies). I ended up k-closing  and number closing a gorgeous girl. Fast forward to last saturday...I was at the bar just chatting with a group of friends and was just having fun. Out of the corner of my eye I see this pretty girl staring me down, so I gestured her with a wave to come over and she does. I chat her up, kino the fuck out it, and use some push-pull techniques to get her to kiss me. So we are just straight making out and she just reaches down my pants and gives me a HJ right in the middle of the fucking bar! Shit was badass, and unexpected so I just went with it. I coulda f-closed this girl but she was straight hammered, and I was pretty damn sober. She wanted me to take her home, but I let her know that I would like to, it just goes against what I stand for. I got her number tho, and we are still talking. Plan on f-closing this chick, but without the influence of alcohol. 

Just wanted to thank this subreddit for giving me some new found confidence and to tell all the other brothers out there that everyone has the alpha inside of them, the hard part is just finding out how to unleash it.

1316186953.0,182,self.seduction,khpso,How learning about seduction helped me ace a job interview - and how you can benefit too.,230,48,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/khpso/how_learning_about_seduction_helped_me_ace_a_job/,"Contacted Tuesday, interviewed Wednesday, hired Thursday.  I'm a network engineer, and this is the highest-paid position I've held, in a wonderful company that gives me a lot of respect.  

I want to share how I earned this position, because I believe if there's one community on Reddit that would get it, it's Seddit.

This is about how to gently achieve *frame control* in an interview, and use that to make yourself seem compellingly different from all the other candidates.  

You all know the typical prep stuff (dress nice, shave, prepare your talking points, research the company, etc) so I won't go into that.

When you interview for a job, there's typically a moment where you and the others sit down at a table, with your resume (CV) on the desk, and there's a pregnant pause while everyone takes a deep breath, and then: 

""Ok, so it says here on your CV that you used to work at...""

From that moment on, it's a gentle, socially-accepted interrogation, with you under the spotlight.  We don't want that to happen.  Here's how we set the frame.

Mentally prepare yourself to jump in at that pregnant pause - you want to **be the first one to talk** about yourself.  Don't wait for the questioning to begin.  Start with something like:

""Thanks for meeting with me.  If you don't mind, I'd like to start by telling you a bit more about myself, and why I think that *I'd be a good choice for this position*. As you may have seen, I have experience with a number of *blah blah blah*... ...""

And then wrap up your introductory speech with

""So, no doubt you have some questions for me, so I'll hand it over to you.""  (or if with a group of interviewers)  ""Well, I'm sure you have some questions to ask, would you like to go first?""

This sets up a powerful frame - that you, the interviewee - are now leading the discussion.  Prompting them.  Asking them the questions.  Done properly, it feels more like *you're interviewing them* to see if their company is good enough for you.  In this way, you establish a high value at the beginning, and then the questions that they will ask you are less about them checking that you're capable, but more congruency tests.  If you lose your nerve, they'll smell it.  So don't.

Seddit, best of luck on your new job.

Eventually I catch eyes.  A beautiful, tan Carioca with deep green eyes is staring back at me.  I smile and walk over to her.


Me:  “Do you speak English?”

Her:  “Yes I do” (with a bit of an accent, though she is obviously proud of her English)

Me:  [huge smile] “You’re adorable!” [throw my arms around her for a hug]

Her: [laughs, smiles and squeezes back]


**By far, the BEST way I have found to meet girls in Latin America is by asking “Do you speak English?”**  I actually speak Portuguese and Spanish quite well.  But starting in English allows me to do three things:


1)  I get to give a huge, effusive hug if they say anything resembling “Yes.”  (it’s always nice to switch back to my native language).  In most upscale clubs, this will be the case; less likely in dive bars.

2)  I get their immediate attention as they are now trying their best to understand and communicate in a second language

3)  I get to impress them 3 minutes later by switching to Spanish/Portuguese.  **Your attractive qualities are much more impressive when they come as a slight surprise!**  Speaking in English for a few minutes allows me to play into the ignorant gringo stereotype which I can then break out of.


Anywho . . .


I can tell from that first hug and ensuing eye contact that it’s on from square one.  Not two minutes later though, one of the guys I came with sees us from across the bar.


Guy I came with: “Not her!  God, anyone but her!”


I look at them both, puzzled.  


Me: “Do you know each other?”


Turns out they have friends in common and he has a crush on her.  Disappointed, I walk away to talk to him.  He brought me to the party and has invited me to crash at his place, so I don’t want to step on fingers if I can avoid it.  Good news is, after a short talk he settles down and gives me the go ahead.  So I go back to the green-eyed Carioca.


The makeout is there straight away and we wander the bar together all night.  Her friend who came with her is a total trooper and puts up with this for like an hour.  


At the end of the night, we trade numbers, part ways, and agree to meet the next night.'
____________________________________________________________

The next night I feel AWFUL.  My allergies have gone haywire.  Still, I’m not about to squander Saturday in Rio, especially since I have plans with this girl.


We meet at a bar and chill with a group for a while.  It becomes pretty clear everyone has their own agenda.  The single guys want to go to a huge, expensive club.  The couples want to go to a cheap local sausagefest.  And I want to OD on Allegra, eat a bowl of Acai, and pass the fuck out.


I tell the girl:


Me:  “When are we going back to your place?”

Her:  [She attempts to hide a big smile, acting like she missed the implication] “What do you mean?  We aren’t going to my place!”

Me;  “Yes we are.  And I am going to pass out on your bed and you are going to take care of me then fall asleep on the couch.”

Her:  “Haha, okay okay but I just moved in and I don’t have a couch.”

Me:  “Either way, let’s just find me a place to collapse”


**In this case, everything I did assumed the decision had already been made to go back to her place.  I asked her when we were going like I was asking her what the weather was tomorrow.  Then I put her at ease by implying that we weren’t sleeping together.  Important: I didn’t say I would take the couch, I said she would!  That keeps it playful as opposed to weird and threatening.**


She is incredibly motherly and concerned about my allergies.  She doesn’t care that the more time she spends with me the more likely she is to get sick.  And she doesn’t care that kissing me basically puts the nail in her coffin.  It sounds gross, but it was actually pretty sweet and endearing.  Mostly though, we just ate acai and chatted til we could pick up her apt keys from her friend.


By the time we go back to her place I felt so beat.  We passed out in her twin sized bed without incident.  


I woke up feeling much better.  She invited me to stay with her for the rest of my trip, another 3 days.  I gladly accepted.  In an absurd display of trust she handed me her key and went off to work.  I love Brazilian culture!


Aside from her work, we spent my final 3 days in Brazil together, hooking up and hanging out.


When the day came for me to leave, she had brought me a rose and begged me not to go.  I was shocked by how quickly this girl had opened her heart to me.  


You might think this quick hot-and-heavy connecting is just something this girl does all the time.  I can assure you it was not.  She has been with very few guys and in the short interaction with her group of friends I met a bunch of guys who were actively pursuing a relationship with her (to no avail).  


**The point is you need to kill the mindset that say “If a girl comes home with me right away, she must be a slut.”  Banish that judgmental BS from your brain.  If you are good at this and express non-judgmentalness, you will become the exception to the rule.**


Flash forward 3 weeks and she just got done visiting me in NYC for 10 days.  Really incredible what a connection you can make by just holding eye contact in bar.

They go to my school (a college, not high school) and most people who will be there also go to my school, but I know next to none of them. The three or so I do know, I don't know very well. Only enough to say hi and carry a slight amount of small talk. 

I know my first impulse when I get there will be to grab a beer and find the nearest couch/chair to squat in the entire night, but I don't want to do that. How can I go from feeling completely uncomfortable and exposed when I get there, to talking to people, and women especially? It's a house party by the way. 

This is diving in the deep end for me, not having a wing man to use as a security blanket is going to be tough, wish me luck, and thank you for any help! 

**UPDATE** 

Wow! I can't believe how popular this post got, thank you for all of your support! I put this down in the comments as well, but I'll post it here as well;

Things went FUCKING GREAT. I got two #-closes and k-closed another girl!!! This had to have been the greatest party I've ever been to. I don't know what it was, I just went in and talked to everyone. Anyone I made eye contact with I made sure to ask for their name and talk to them at least momentarily. I ended up dancing with one group of girls even, standing in the middle of a circle they created and dancing my ass off and they fuckin loved it!!!! One of the girls from that circle was the one I would later make out with.

I ended the night with some great conversation with a girl who actually came back to my house with me and was laying in my bed watching tv with me. No f-close from it though, she made it verbally clear that she ""isn't one of those girls"", but she was very interesting to talk to so I layed there with her for a few hours with my arm around her talking to her and just relaxing enjoying reflecting on my night and all the good that came from it. That same girl is on her way over to my place right now to hang out and I still have the girl I made out with and the on other girl I got a number from on stand-by for another day or later on this afternoon!!

Can't wait to go to another party by myself, I'm seriously going to avoid taking buddies with me if its the least bit out of my way to do so. Going by yourself to a party is so much fun and I recommend everyone do it. You'll be surprised by how much fun you'll have when you're not worried about saying something to the person you came with every 10 seconds. Cheers mates!!

1332377138.0,184,self.seduction,r7mh5,How to Internalize Seduction Concepts,211,27,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/r7mh5/how_to_internalize_seduction_concepts/,"Hey guys.

So a question I get a lot is how did I manage to get to the level I'm at? I've always had a bit of trouble explaining it, but the other day it all came clear...

How I internalized seduction concepts was identical to how I became fluent in a foreign language.

I started studying Japanese in earnest when I was 20 and had moved to Japan. Within a year I was conversationally fluent to the point where I didn't actively think about it much anymore. Within 2 years I was professionally fluent. I had *internalized* the language.

---

**LANGUAGE**

Here's how I did it:

1) **Study lots of material.** Spend 3 hours a day either in class or doing homework/exercises to learn grammar patterns and vocabulary. 

2) **Go out, every single day,** and make an effort to use every grammar pattern or new vocab words learned that day a minimum of 3 times. (""Use a new word three times in a day and it's yours for life."")

3) **Do it again the next day,** building on what was already learned. 

---

**SEDUCTION**

Now check this out... This is how I learned seduction...

1) **Study seduction concepts,** starting with basic outer game concepts ([here](http://redd.it/ero8h) and [here](http://redd.it/ctoxh)), and then moving onto more conceptual inner game materials (my favorite being RSD's The Blueprint Decoded) and the posts [here](http://redd.it/gjqim). Spend 1-2 hours a day absorbing material and discussion.

2) **Go out as often as humanly possible,** for as many hours as possible, actively applying what you had most recently studied - all the time looking for mini-breakthroughs and building new reference experiences. (For all you guys who have had those moments of epiphany, it's one of the greatest times you'll ever have in your life.)

3) **Chart your experience** via posting field reports and absorbing insights and advice from the seddit community. Repeat the process night after night, building upon the concepts already learned.

---

I did this and BAM, slowly but surely, I began to internalize deep concepts that I didn't even know existed before setting off on this journey.

Follow these steps and you WILL see dramatic improvements in your social skills. I promise you this. There will be times when it will seem frustrating, but just remember - above all, have fun. This is an awesome, identify-altering journey that will turn you into a version of yourself that you didn't know possible. Become awesomeness embodied.

1291104481.0,184,self.seduction,edsy6,"AskReddit survey results - ""Women of reddit: How often are you approached by men and how does it make you feel?""",220,36,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/edsy6/askreddit_survey_results_women_of_reddit_how/,"Hi guys. Earlier today I put a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/edj2r/women_of_reddit_how_often_are_you_approached_by/) in /r/AskReddit/ titled ""Women of reddit: How often are you approached by men and how does it make you feel?""

I have been carefully monitoring the results and have drawn a few generalizations which I would like to share. I think it's very important to have a firm grasp on the female experience of pickup, wouldn't you agree?

Obviously the reddit userbase skews more towards introverted/nerdy, but this is still a decent sized sample set to pull from.

* Women who are rarely hit on tend to be more appreciative of being approached and are more likely to describe it as flattering as opposed to creepy.
* However, women who are rarely hit on are much less socially calibrated and are often very awkward/nervous in the exchange.
* Attractive women are hit on on nearly a daily basis. They completely reject superficial compliments on their appearance and have many socially uncalibrated chumps and AMOGs throwing awful proposals and compliments in their general direction.
* **To me this completely validates the HB numbering system with how we have to do our approaches regarding social calibration and bitch shields. So nothing new learned, but an old concept solidified.**
* Many women claim to not want to be approached while running errands (e.g. day game). However when out during the day, shields are dropped big time as approaches are much less common than in bars/clubs.
* Approaches in neutral venues like cafes and bookstores seem to be quite well received.
* However, when approached by men in a bar whom they regard as ""shy"" or ""not purely there to pick up girls"" it has led to many fruitful relationships and even some marriages.
* **This tells me that most regular girls don't want to feel like they're just a notch on a headboard. Try and work some of this into your approaches.**
* That being said, they do almost exclusively want men who can ""build up the confidence"" to approach them and speak to them and take the lead. Confidence is very sexy.
* Bringing up sex in the early stages of a pickup is telling your hand a bit too early according to many of the women.
* **I'm not convinced on this one yet, but I'll run more in field tests and see.**
* Girls truly like it when guys can make them laugh in the early stages of an interaction.
* Girls like it even more when they feel a mutual connection over something. E.g. you read the same book or like the same sports team.
* **This tells us that rapport building is critical and must be done at the earliest stages and that laughter is a great way to hook a set early**
* By far the most well received openers are opinion openers and semi-direct ""Hi, my name is X, what's yours?"" openers.
* Direct openers ""You're stunning."" will likely flatter a girl with a low self-image but get you stereotyped as just another guy trying to bang an HB7, 8 or 9.
* Not a single mention of kino. This tells me that when applied properly, they don't even notice kino is happening.
* **This is a very good sign IMO.**
* Almost no thoughts/memories of the followup stage between initial encounter and day-2.
* **This tells me that it's almost always determined whether she will call/text you back by the time you finish the interaction (attraction, comfort, rapport, close). The method you employ to follow up with her should not be so important if you do your approaches right.**
* Well timed and sincere compliments on beauty have a very powerful effect. Their memory can last for years with some women.
* **My initial thought is this is why direct day game is so powerful. I plan to try more of this in field soon, especially with girls who don't go to bars and clubs.**
* The ""I have a boyfriend"" excuse is the #1 method of escaping a pickup situation. However a couple girls admit if they find a man exceptionally attractive, it's not really that big of an obstacle.
* No girls like it when you buy them drinks so stop doing it.
* Remembering girls' names is very important.
* Posture and body language are very important.
* There are a surprisingly alarming number of very nice but low-self-image-having men and women on reddit (and likely in all walks of life.) A lot of PUA is geared towards very beautiful women who get hit on a lot. However for a lot of the casual reformed AFCs here, if you can calibrate your game properly, there is an entire world of HB6s and below who are experiencing the whole 'forever alone' thing you might be going through. It's something you should give some serious thought to. For the casual sedditors, this could be a very great development for you.

*What other observations and trends can you draw from the thread, seddit?*

In closing, I would like to ask you all to be mindful of women and their opinions. PUAs get a horrible reputation as a bunch of misogynists and I am doing everything I can to stop it. I ask you all to do the same. Women are creatures of beauty and we should always leave them in a better place than we find them, regardless of how our interactions go.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_edsy6,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/edsy6/askreddit_survey_results_women_of_reddit_how/,

I took her out to coffee and then offered to smoke her a bowl so we went back to her place.  I kino'd her quite a bit and then we started kissing and getting hot-n-heavy.  However, every time I tried to place my hand on her silk igloo she would push it away.  I thought maybe this was just typical LMR, so I would lay off and try it again after a while, to no avail.  She wouldn't even let me take her bra off.  Finally, she said something like ""I don't like to have to tell you more than once.""

So I backed off a little, and did some ""deep-diving.""  Listened to her talk a little, asked her about her goals and aspirations (she wants to become a sex therapist or a marriage counselor).  Then, I started again.  I managed to get her bra and shirt off, but she was still pushing me away from my real goal.  This went on for a while, and then I laid back and talked to her some more.  She kept talking about how she doesn't want to do anything on the first date, she's not that type of girl, etcetera.  And then it clicked.

It clicked for me because she said something about how girls who sleep with guys on the first date have limited chances for a LTR.  Then I remembered an article I had read on Seddit a few days earlier.  The article talked about how if a girl wants to have an LTR she will likely not sleep with you on the first date (or even the 2nd or 3rd sometimes).  This is because she perceives you as ""boyfriend material.""  I am a very level-headed person, and a law-student, so it would be easy for me to fall into the ""longterm potential"" trap.

So I took the advice the article I had read gave, and disqualified myself as a potential boyfriend.  I talked off-handedly about how I won't be having any relationships until I get out of law school (2 years from now) because I'm in the school for 14-16 hours a day and ""it wouldn't be fair to whoever I was in a relationship with.""  I talked about how I had to focus on school and nothing else, but it would be worth it in the long run.

Anyway, that did the trick.  We went at it again, and that time I had absolutely no problem getting her pants and underwear off.  The funniest part was when she said ""I can't believe I changed my mind,"" and I was thinking ""I know exactly why you changed your mind, lol.""

One last thing.  Thank you to whoever posted that article.  I seriously would have been fucked (or, rather, not have?) had I not read that article.

***TLDR:***  Encountered heavy LMR and ""I don't sleep with a guy on the first date,"" while getting hot-n-heavy with new girl.  Remembered Seddit advice and realized she was thinking I could be her boyfriend and she didn't want to ruin her chances.  Disqualified myself as a potential bf by saying I wouldn't be having a relationship for at least 2 years, due to law school.

Hey all,

Some people have complained that **[AskSeddit](http://reddit.com/r/AskSeddit)** posts don't get enough responses, so I thought a weekly post summarizing some of the top AskSeddit posts would be helpful in several ways. 

First, it'll help AskSeddit by bringing a higher volume and quality of comments – some of these posts could have used better advice, IMHO.

Second, it should be interesting to Sedditors in general, without being too obtrusive.

And third, it'll be a non-annoying reminder that AskSeddit is the best place for most specific questions.

So here are three posts from this week (selected subjectively by me, based on upvotes, number of comments, and IMHO relevance):

---

**#1. [I was caught a bit offguard](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/g49qd/i_was_caught_a_bit_offgaurd/)** [top rated]

Basically, a dude (oozzo) is getting massively hit on by a cute nurse at his workplace, and their mutual female friend is trying to facilitate. He's practically got this girl on a silver platter, plus she's giving him free cake. 

So what's the problem? Their work schedules aren't aligned, so he's not sure when he's going to have a chance to run into her again and ask her out. So he was wondering, is asking her out via Facebook an option?

ThrowawayPUA's comment was spot on, basically saying, they're trying to set you up, stop making it difficult! I wish someone would've also added, **no, don't ask a girl out via Facebook** unless that's really and truly your only option. 

IMHO, I think he should tell his friend, ""Hey, do you know when Cute Nurse is working this week? I was hoping to chat but I don't know if we're even here at the same time."" Probably the friend would immediately call Cute Nurse, and they'd make it happen scheduling-wise and then inform OP when and where he's suppose to pick her up.

Would that it were always that easy...

oozoo, it would be cool to have an update if anything's happened since earlier this week.

**#2. [Day Game &gt; girl hooked &gt; how to proceed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/g2my7/day_game_girl_hooked_how_to_proceed/)**

So AFCAFC gets an awesome response on his second direct approach ever:

&gt;Me: Hi, I wanted to say hi because I think you're cute

&gt;Her: (stunned look, thought I was gonna get blown out at this point) omggg nobody has ever told me that before!

...#-closes, and it's a solid number. How does he set up a date? 

His question and the comments mostly focused on the timing (weekend vs. Monday, etc.), which I don't have strong feelings about... but I DO have strong feelings about the rule of thumb that **when you're proposing a date via text, you should use declarative or imperative sentences, and propose specifics details** (at least the day, and usually also time and location). OP was considering the text ""Drinks? Later?"" which breaks both of those rules. Something more like ""Let's have drinks Thursday"" is way better. If I had seen that post before now I would've contributed those two cents.

AFCAFC, an update would be cool if you have one.

---

**#3. [what change made the biggest difference in your results?](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/g3gn3/ask_seddit_what_change_made_the_biggest/)** [most commented]

This was an intentionally open-ended question that lead to responses like the following (in rough order of upvotes):

* ""I started doing the things I wanted to do.... **I became comfortable being me again**.... I remembered I'm awesome and that if one particular women doesn't want me, there will be another one that does. Abundance mentality.""

* ""**Looking people in the eyes. **Seriously, it's so basic and so essential. How are you going to know she's into you if you don't even look at her? So much information only from the eyes. I might be going overboard with the 'look away first, shit test failed' but seriously, I prefer looking for too long rather than not enough. If you are creeping her out, you'll know, but if she is into you, the look, then the smile ... makes my day every god damn time! ^_^""

* ""Repeated humiliation. **Once I got shot down about a hundred times, I stopped caring about rejection.** It became meaningless to me, one rejection is like all the others. I often joke that I have the goal of being shot down a thousand times. But I really do have that as a goal. There are no failures, only learning experiences. We learn by our failures, so get busy and get out there and fail. What is important is that you are learning new skills, not that you pull any specific girl. Take care of the process, and the results will follow.""

* ""For me, the realization that **girls expect/want you to escalate and touch them and it's not that hard/not that scary.** I've been FZ'd so hard several times by not touching girls.... What I've learned is this shit is pretty easy. Do it in relative sequence and you don't have to worry much about rejection.""

* ""Learning to **make life about entertaining myself.**""

* ""A bad breakup caused to me to go out and try to get as much random sex as possible. All I needed was **a few fucks and some fuck buddies, and I've been a confident motherfucker ever since.**""

That last comment was downvoted actually, but I think it's a good one, and sort of true for me personally. I'm no pro, but after about 10 lays in my mid-20s, getting laid turned from this existential craving (which makes it hard to avoid oneitis, scarcity mentality, etc.) to a more healthy sort of appetite (which makes it easier to relax and have fun).

**Bonus post:**

I just posted an interesting question from sexxit, by a straight girl (ha!) looking for advice on **[how to find girls to fuck the daylights out of with a strap-on](http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/g6r31/xpost_from_rsex_straight_girl_been_browsing_strap/)**. I tried to send her here, but I don't think she came.

Basically, it poses the interesting challenge of summing up essential pickup ideas succinctly, and for a female picking up females. And since OP identifies as straight, and isn't really into most lesbians she's met, it kind of breaks the mold of ""pickup for dykes"" too.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_g6s0x,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/g6s0x/this_week_in_askseddit_facebook_texting_101_and/,
1350622221.0,183,self.seduction,11qe7m,Dear fellow introverts: Introversion is not a handicap.  Stop viewing it that way.,239,56,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11qe7m/dear_fellow_introverts_introversion_is_not_a/,"A few disclaimers:  I am fairly new to the whole PUA thing, and not really here to be a seduction master.  I'm mostly trying to become a more confident person and learn to meet new people.  But I see a lot of misunderstanding about introversion, not just here, but in the world in general.  If you are a proud extrovert and see something that you take offense to, I assure you it wasn't intended that way.  You have a natural advantage in the social department, and a lot of misguided introverts just need a pep talk.

First, a lot of people don't actually get what introversion is.  Introversion is not social awkwardness.  Introversion is not shyness.  I feel like I need to put that part in bold. **Introversion is not social awkwardness.  Introversion is not shyness**.  You've probably unknowingly met many very sociable and charismatic people that were introverts.  Introversion has nothing to do with social skills.  Just digging around on google for 5 minutes, I found loads of famous introverts:  Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, Johnny Depp, David Letterman, Lady Gaga... The list is (figuratively) endless.

What is introversion then?  Simply put: Extroverts gain energy by interacting with other people.  Introverts spend energy when interacting with other people.  That is really all there is to it.  After spending extended periods of time with people, introverts need to ""recharge"" by spending time alone.

One complaint I hear a lot from introverts is ""I don't like the club/bar scene.  I don't want to go to parties.  Therefore, I can't possibly learn PUA skills"".  This, simply put, is BS.  Have you ever been to a grocery store?  Have you ever walked down a street that had more than one other person on it?  Have you ever worked in an environment where you don't know absolutely everyone at the company?  If you answered yes to any of these, you could be developing these skills every day.

Remember that time you were at the grocery store, looking to pick up a nice bottle of wine, and that other person (an HB9 or some fat, ugly guy, it doesn't even matter) walked into the same aisle near you?  Ask for a recommendation.  Or when you were walking down the street earlier today, and you passed that girl?  Just say hi and smile.  (Was that so hard?)  Or that awkward elevator ride with that guy from another department you don't know.  Make a joke about how slow the elevators are in the office.  You just have to talk to people, it doesn't matter where and it doesn't matter who.  Every interaction is an improvement and a learning experience.

**Introverts have advantages**.  It's true.  Introverts are usually good listeners.  Introverts generally have above average intelligence.  The wittiest and most enjoyable people I've known in my life have mostly been introverts.  You gain energy when you are recharging at home.  Instead of spending that time watching TV, pick up a new hobby, or learn something new.  It is so easy for introverts to become interesting people because we have the ability to spend time alone learning new things, and all the while we are building up energy.  We have a strong ability to focus on things, and are often very passionate in our hobbies, a quality that everyone is attracted to.  We are also often very self reflective and able to understand and analyze our own emotions.

In my opinion, the biggest problem introverts face is the self defeating belief that introversion is a disadvantage.  You have to come to the realization that introversion isn't what is holding you back, you are.

**TLDR** - Post title pretty much sums it up.

1297778031.0,181,self.seduction,fltg9,Why Guys Struggle Getting Quality Girls. ,245,64,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fltg9/why_guys_struggle_getting_quality_girls/,"I can still remember like it was yesterday getting blown out by the first really hot girl I ever approached. It was a humbling experience and one that is etched in my memory. There comes a time in your learning experience when you try to go for quality rather than quantity and the struggles you face are packed with lessons. The following are some observations taken from my personal journal.


**1) When You See a Girl You Process Your Value Compared to Hers.**


Basically this means that when you see a girl you are sizing her up and then placing a value upon her based in a number of qualities, mainly attributed with appearance. This looks based value system continues until conversation is made and then it scales back a small about but as guys we are still driven by appearances. 


For the women they too judge appearance but there are so many other factors that play into attraction for them. Instead of the symmetrical qualities that we as guys look for they are much more concerned with the sub communications and if the guy is taking care of himself.  If the guy looks like he took longer to get ready then the woman did then many times they will be turned off. If he looked like he walked out of the forest and hasn’t shaved or showered we all know that, that is a deal breaker as well. The main thing that a woman is looking for upon approach is the subtitle cues WAY MORE then what you are actually saying. 


**2) Value is a Filter That Alters Your Perception. **


This aspect is true for guys and for girls, that PERCIEVED value is a filter in which we view the individual. The reason that I capitalized perceived is because perception often times equates with deception. Remember back about 8 years ago when the magic eyes pictures were all the craze? Basically, it was a picture that upon staring at it for sometime you would see a 3d image. At first all you saw was a scrambled picture with nothing in it, but once you finally got it you could see the actual picture inside it. The first perception was that there was nothing there; upon closer inspection we realize that there was something there and we were deceived at first. 

Value works just like the 3d image. 


**3) She is Sizing You Up Based On….**


To get the girls of exceptional quality one must be valuable to themselves and display value in a way that is congruent with who they are. What I mean by this is since girls respond to value the way we respond to a beautiful girl in a mini-skirt, we must display value in a way that is congruent with whom we are. When I say that women respond to value I mean that they judge your relative worth and importance based on factors like confidence, your ability to create fun, your personality and how you make her feel. These things are some of the attributes of value. There are other factors like, your style, your attitude and your body language that play pivotal roles as well but value is the entire package that you put together. 



**4) Women Think More Long Term When it Comes to Value. **

Women tend to think about where this will go and what could happen down the road. To display the value that most exceptional girls look for, (and again most 10s are not your average run of the mill club rat, these are the girls who have looks, brains and ambition) you must project your value in a long term setting. Being goal driven in your career and life is something that these rare types of girls will truly be attracted to. This displays a mastery over your sense of self. What this sub communicates about you is that you have a vision for the future and she could share in the fruition of that vision, this excites and stimulates her from a stability perspective. Women tend to pair bond and want relationships so displaying the characteristics that support that is an attractive thing to them.


**5) The Method Behind the Madness**


I know that in this community we tend to have a chip on our shoulder that closing women makes you better at this game and in some ways, “cooler” among your peers. The truth of the matter is I work as a dating coach, have worked with many people across the world, worked with major pick up companies and through all that I STILL fail. What makes me succeed where others give up is my passion not to wrack up the most lays but to leave women better then I found them. This principal of giving value is ironically something that goes against the grain of much of the mainstream community ideology. We are taught to neg (lower a woman’s value) we are taught to DHV (demonstrate higher value) and all in attempts to finally get her home and have sex. Sure we all want to have sex but the irony is that the more you make a girl feel that she has value beyond replication she is instinctively drawn to you as a moth is drawn to a flame. 

To get the really quality women takes the right combination of value and elusiveness. You must stay just out of her range NOT out of her league. At the end of the day getting that quality girl is much more about who you believe you are and what you are displaying. It’s also about value, both giving and receiving it rather then negs, backhanded compliments or displaying HIGHER value.

1332720495.0,182,self.seduction,rde3x,I survived my first direct approach :),220,38,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/rde3x/i_survived_my_first_direct_approach/,"Today I directly approached a girl for the first time at a mall. While I got ""rejected"", it didn't feel sad or painful or anything. It actually felt amazing, like I had broken through a wall and gotten to the next level. Actually if we're going to use a video game analogy, I should say that it felt like I actually started playing ""the game"" and not just reading manuals and watching walk-through videos about it.

So how did I do it?

First, to help me with confidence, I wore a new jacket and some new shoes that I had bought the day before. I know this is a superficial crutch but my normal sweater/jacket was 2 sizes too big since I've been on a diet and my only pair shoes were over a year old, so it made sense to get some new ones anyway. The new look I had looked way more intense and bad ass than the normal polo shirt and sneakers that I usually wear, and people treated me with high social status because of it, which also helped. I don't want to become dependent on it though so next time I go out to approach girls I'll try to do so using a more normal/casual look, which will actually probably work better since I'll feel more congruent in my regular clothes. I'm also practicing not giving a fuck whenever possible and doing things outside of social norms to help build my core confidence.

Second, I didn't go alone. I went with a friend who was a girl who agreed to come with me to help me hit on girls. I was able to banter with her as we walked around the mall and in and out of stores looking for girls to approach. I had fun making her laugh and I was getting occasional IOIs from other girls that looked nice, but I still felt too shy to approach for some reason. While she wasn't involved with the actual approach, just talking to her helped kept me out of my head and in a social mindset.

Finally, to feel more motivated to approach I decided I wouldn't eat lunch until I had made my one direct approach.

After about an hour and a half I was starting to get really hungry and tired of walking around so I decided to just stand outside one of the women's clothing stores and talk to my female friend about whatever came to mind and just wait for a girl to walk out of the store and approach her. After about 5 minutes a cute girl walked by and I thought to myself ""THAT'S THE ONE! RUN FUCKER RUN!"" So I ran past her, turned around, and said ""Hi, this is going to sound really random but I just saw you walking by and thought you looked really nice."" She smiled and said ""thanks"" and kept on walking.

And just like that, it was over. My first ""rejection"", if you can even call it that. It actually felt good since I had proved to myself that I actually had the confidence to do a direct approach.

Now I just need to get used to doing it dozens of times a day by myself at any venue wearing anything. One step at a time!",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_rde3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/rde3x/i_survived_my_first_direct_approach/,

1) Don't be attached to outcome

2) Be decisive. When you have the opportunity to make a decision for the group do it, don't pass off your power/

3) Put energy into an interest. Whatever it may be, join a club for it, take a class on it, read some books on it, etc. You will be a more interesting person

4) Project your voice. Don't be obnoxiously loud but speak clearly and precisely. Don't talk quietly and make a speach out of what you're saying.

5) Don't be sensitive. Embrace criticism, welcome challenges. Laugh when someone pokes fun at you. Life is a lot easier when you don't let these petty things get to you.

6) Posture. It's damned near impossible to feel insecure about yourself when you walk down the sidewalk/hall/street like you're Vlad the conqueror. Stand with your back against a wall. Make sure that your heels, ass, shoulders and head are touching the wall, and walk away holding that position. Learn that and feel what it feels like to stand like that, but in a relaxed way. You shouldn't look like you're exerting any effort to hold that position, but instead that having perfect posture is simply the most comfortable and efficient means of standing and moving for you.

7) Smile when you walk in the room or ""change frames"". It's a simple way to show that you are completely comfortable in that setting, and have ownership over the situation.

8) Try and have more fun than anybody in any given situation. People love to smile and laugh, they just need an excuse to do it. Let yourself be that excuse for others to stop and smell the roses from time to time.

9) Don't feel a need to respond to every question

10) Never get too attached to anyone, anything, or any idea

11) Don't look for fun, Be the fun

12) Be bold without being arrogant

13) Don't judge yourself or others any more than absolutely necessary

14) Stand out without fear. Be the opposite of someone who caters to the masses, blends in, tries to make everyone happy, tries to make things work for everyone, tries too hard to be perfect, tries too hard for others sake.

I mistakenly posted there instead of seddit but in case you haven't seen it--here's ""my"" **Complete Idiot's Guide to Dancing**.

Disclaimer: By no means am I an authority on breaking it down, I just like dancing. Consider this a guide not just to dance ""game"" but also having a good time on the dancefloor, by yourself in your apartment, on stage at a concert, wherever. Do all this in front of a mirror or when you're cleaning your room to get a feel for it, whatever floats your boat.

**RULES**

*Applicable to all situations*

SMILE. If you don't have a silly grin on your face when you're dancing, you're not doing it right. Learn to laugh at yourself.

ENJOY YOURSELF. Don't see dancing as a method to get laid. Have fun doing it. Feel the music and your body moving. Sounds corny but dancing is awesome. If you're going to do it you might as well have fun.

**GUIDE TO DANCING ALONE**

*STEP 1*

You've probably seen it in all the movies and heard it when you were in 7th grade, but it's still true as ever: move your body to the beat. Start with what I call the ""white guy bop""--shift your shoulders left and right to the beat of music.

*STEP 2*

Good start, but now start doing some rotation--do the twist. (Obligatory Pulp Fiction scene). Try to get flexible and manipulate your upper body and head and neck every way you can.

*STEP 3*

Incorporate the hips! If you've ever playfully (violently?) side-bumped a girl while you were walking down the street you know how to move your hips.

*STEP 4*

Take a few steps! Back and forth, side to side, while building on steps 1-3. Dip down low, then get on your toes. When Shout comes on, get your ass to the grass! This song is the easiest way to establish attraction with someone else in a group. You're low on the ground, staring at each other, dancing...fuck how much easier could it be??

NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO DANCE! Never more will you be the creeper dude who just stands there nodding his head and staring at girl's breasts. Hopefully.

**THE APPROACH**

Always, always, always come in from the front. It's tough if there's a circle. In that situation I act crazy and jump in and start going wild. It's usually enough for people to say, GO GO GO. Then you back it out a little and grab a girl's hand. DOESN'T MATTER WHO. The uglier the better.

In smaller groups, simply extend your hand. If you're making eye contact she'll often take it. Or, while you're dancing with your friends (you are dancing with your friends, right? Even if they're guys?) look over your shoulder, draw eye contact with the girl behind you, and start dancing while still looking over your shoulder. Give her a smile while you wriggle closer. Make an introduction between her group and yours, then get on it!

**DANCING WITH SOMEONE ELSE**

Now you're dancing with someone else. First things first, keep dancing and having fun. Stillness is your enemy. How do you initiate contact? You can go bold and grab her by the waist but most girls are a little wary of that.

**DO A SPIN. BITCHES LOVE SPINS.**

Here is your repertoire of spin moves, from basic to advanced:
Basic one-handed spin. Just grab her left hand with your right (or vice versa) and lift it. She'll do the rest. Why is it important that you grab her left with your right? So there's no confusion over the direction!

* Reverse spin. Immediately follows your basic spin. Right after you complete your spin, you lift your arm again. Like before, she'll do the rest. Try the 1-2 combo of forward and reverse.
* Half spin. Initiate as with a typical spin, raising your left, her right (or vice versa). She'll begin turning away from you; rather than letting her come full circle (see what I did there?) bring your arm down around her when she's facing away. As batshit_lazy states below, you can step to the side and catch her across the back of her waist with your right hand. Now it's like you're standing next to each other, your right hand holding her waist and your left hand holding her right hand across her body. Feel free to lean back, flash a smile, go in for a kiss, etc.
* Two handed half spin. Shit's getting real now. Grab both her hands with your own and raise your left arm (her right), dropping the other. As she's turning and her left hand is across her body and her right hand is in the air (your left hand is up there guiding her through the spin), you drop your left hand when she's facing away from you. Now both her hands are crossed across her body, your hands are around her, and you start grinding from behind. This has multiple advantages: this hand-crossed position makes her feel sexy and intimate, and you get to grind on her booty!

When not spinning feel free to grab her hands and just swing them around and stare into each other's eyes cackling wildly. Live, dammit!

**GRINDING**

*Front grind*

If she's into it, feel free to rub your boner against her. Not recommended for someone you don't know is into that. Otherwise tuck it into your left pocket and dance with your right leg between her legs (or vice versa). Promise yourself to get more erectile control.

Since you're locked into position, there isn't much movement available to you. If you want, lean back a little and leave some room for Jesus. Grab her waist with one hand and hold her hand with the other. Stroke it. When it comes time and you've put on enough moves, start putting your face closer and closer to hers. If she maintains eye contact with you rather than looking away, you know you're close to making out.

*Rear grind*

Use the double hand move transition to go rear. Much more flexibility in this position. Run your hands up and down her waist / leg / butt / breasts (in that order, depending on her degree of comfort). Lean your head forward next to hers. Grab her hands and pull them across the back of your neck so she pulls your head in toward her. I personally think that shit is hot.

OK I think that's all I have for y'all tonight. Take this. Use it. Own it. (Sticky it?). Feel free to add opinions, my knowledge is far from complete. I just know what I enjoy and what I have the most fun doing.

1298088069.0,179,self.seduction,fobhj,Lesson 1: Primer on Being a Modern Alpha Male,243,64,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/,"Hi guys.

I'm here to talk to you today about what being a modern alpha male entails. This, I believe, is the key to successful game. I will be following up with further posts on how to properly display these traits in the field and also which common pitfalls to avoid.

**CHARACTERISTICS OF A MODERN ALPHA MALE**

* **1) Be a leader of men**

People should look to you as a leader. You lead by example. You set the tone for the night. When there's any doubt about what the next move should be, you're the one who decides. You take women by the hand. You're a social hub. You're the one people look to when they're looking for a fun time. You're assertive but take everyone's feelings into account.

* **2) Be firm in your values**

You have meditated and thought about your deepest inner values. You are unwavering on these. These can include things as basic as love of life, traveling, studying, religion, or not tolerating condescension or self-defeating behavior. These are the basic pieces that make up your personality and it is important to know what they are. The average, beta male has trouble describing his personal values to others. He looks to others to define who he is. This will not be you. YOU will define who you are. Nobody else.

* **3) Be self-validated**

You do not need the validation of others to define your confidence. You can get ""in state"" from energy generated purely from within. You don't look to others for approval because you KNOW you're an all-star. You're AWESOME and every fiber of your being knows it. You will not be knocked out of state in the field because nothing can harm your ego. You are awesomeness embodied. Settle for nothing less.

* **4) Be non-reaction seeking &amp; non-reactive**

How someone reacts to your behavior is not particularly important to you. You are self-validated and emanate awesomeness. You are positive, understanding and beneficent to others yet do not need this fact acknowledged. People react to YOU. You do not react to THEM. People seek your approval which you dole out as appropriate. You are outcomes-independent.

* **5) Have social proof and preselection**

Everywhere you go, people want to be associated with you. You have many friends. Beautiful women are part of your life. You accept this as a god-given fact. You own every room you're in. You're Bill Clinton. You have an abundance mentality because your life is abundant.

* **6) Be a value giver (and not a value taker)**

You do not NEED approval from others. Approval is something a high value individual doles out to others. Receiving approval is taking value. Seeking approval is being a value taker. YOU dole out the approval. YOU are approached by value takers. YOU are a value giver. Every person you encounter in your life is better off for having met you. Whether it's just a wave hello to a stranger, a compliment to your butcher, or a massive party you help organize and invite high value people to, you're enriching the lives of others. You are benevolent and compassionate. You look out for and protect the people in your life.

* **7) Be fun**

Everywhere you go, you BRING THE PARTY. You ARE the party! You're able to have fun everywhere you go. You can turn a boring bar into the place to be, just by stepping in the room. You're those people in the club having more fun than everyone else. You're playful, teasing, and spontaneous with the women in your life. People want to be with you and be blessed with the value emanating from your pores.

* **8) Don't be creepy &amp; make sure to dress/groom well**

As a modern, alpha male, it's important to be well groomed and dressed properly for your personality. People look up to you and it's important to put effort into your appearance. Likewise, you will avoid creepy or stalkerish behavior. These are not congruent with an alpha male.

Everyone studying seduction on this board should give serious considering towards living their life to become the embodiment of these eight points.

1370290986.0,180,self.seduction,1flqnw,"The real reason girls flake on you, and how to prevent it",236,56,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1flqnw/the_real_reason_girls_flake_on_you_and_how_to/,"Flaking is when a girl you’ve number closed never meets you for a day 2. Flaking, and how to prevent it, is much discussed within the PUA community, and is considered one of the most annoying aspects of the game by many PUAs.

The community gives us a lot of advice on how to combat flaking. The most common methods given to prevent it are as follows:

Build more comfort. This technique assumes that the girl is attracted to you but, but flakes because she is not yet comfortable spending time with you one on one. You counter this by spending more time building comfort.
Get her to invest more. Investment is basically where she puts in a lot of the work into the interaction, opening up to you. This causes her to feel invested in you, so she wants to see you again.
Time bridging. Old school Mystery Method. This is when you make the date (ie agree on a time and place) during the initial pickup, and go into some detail about what the two of you will get up to on the date. This is meant to work for two reasons. Firstly, she commits to an actual time and date rather than just giving you her number. That commitment drives her to show up. Secondly, the future projection of you two on the date makes her more comfortable with going.
Spend more time in set with her. This is very similar to 1) and 2). Longer sets simply make for more solid numbers because they make her more comfortable and she talks to you more.
Better text game. Teasing can be used to build attraction, and you can build some level of comfort.
While I think all of these these points can help to some degree, they are at best minor optimizations.  There is one overriding factor that determines how likely a girl is to flake. In a nutshell, flaking comes down to one thing:

Girls flake on you because you are not attractive enough for them

I know many people will disagree with this. They’ll say, “There was this one girl. I KNOW I had attraction and she still flaked”. My answer to this objection comes in two parts. Firstly, yes girls will sometimes flake for reasons other than attraction. Poor logistics, life circumstances, really retarded text game and lack of comfort can all cause flakes. I do, however, believe that these cause a small minority of flakes. This is why I say the five points listed above are only optimizations. If you were to get these points down perfectly your flake rate would drop, but probably by at most 10%.

The second part of my rebuttal deals with the nature of attraction itself. Whenever someone in the PUA community says they “had attraction”, I know they don’t really understand the nature of attraction. People who talk about attraction like this understand it like it’s a switch. It’s either on or off. In reality attraction is more like a volume knob. It can be turned off (setting 0, no noise) where there’s no attraction, but once there is attraction it can vary in it’s intensity (setting 10 would be really high volume). Attraction is essentially an emotion, and all emotions vary in intensity. Take anger. If some one bumps into you carelessly in a bar you’d be angry. If someone rapes and murders your sister, you’d also be angry. Obviously the intensity of the anger would massively vary in the two different scenarios.

To really drive this point home, think about your attraction to different women, and how it varies from women to women rather than just being a yes / or no binary thing. I know for me it goes something like this:

&lt;HB4: No attraction
HB5: Wouldn’t take her on a date, but would take her home from the club and fuck her same night if I met her towards the end of the night, and I hadn’t been laid in a while and she made it easy. Wouldn’t even ask for her number after fucking her. This is exactly what happened a couple of weeks back.
HB6: Would almost certainly take her on a date, but not if I was too busy. Would go on one, maybe two dates with her, and if I still hadn’t fucked her that’d be it. I’m getting to the point where I might not even go on dates with girls of this level anymore. Since first date lays are rare (they’re usually on week nights which make it hard, and I think girls just aren’t that likely to fuck on a first date unless they’re really DTF or really into you in a big way), it’s getting pointless for me. Wouldn’t consider a relationship for a girl of this standard.
HB7: Would go on multiple dates (been on up to five) with a girl this attractive. Would want to see her again after fucking her unless I really hated her personality.
HB8: Multiple dates, willing to put in a lit of effort. Definite relationship, possibly exclusive, unless her personality is intolerable.
HB9: Never number closed a girl this hot.
The point is this. A woman can be somewhat attracted to you (for example she kisses you in a club after a couple of drinks), but the intensity of that attraction isn’t enough for her to go on a date with you when you text her a couple of days later. The lack of attraction causes the flake.

The reason I think this to be true is that for me, the level of attractiveness of the girl is the number one factor that determines how likely she is to flake. All the other variables: length of set, investment, whether I time bridged, how far I escalated don’t seem to have much, if any impact on whether a girl will flake or not. It breaks down a lot like this:

HB5 and below: I don’t number close these girls.
HB6: Rarely flake. Maybe a 10% flake rate. Sometimes they even text me first.
HB7: It’s 50/50 as to whether I’ll get her out on a date.
HB8: Usually flakes. I’d guess an 80%+ flake rate,
HB9: Never number closed.
This fits in nicely with the idea of the differences between a man and womens sexual market value (SMV) being the main deciding factor in how attracted one person is to another person. Since girls are hypergamous they have a strong preference for a man at least one point higher than them on the SMV scale. This is the minimum most girls believe they deserve, but I think they’ll occasionally ‘settle’ for a guy on their level. Given I think a 7 is a fair judgement of my SMV, the patterns of flakes make a lot of sense. The 8s are above me so basically always flake. The 7s, on my level are hoping for better so often flake. The 6s have their sights firmly set on a guy like me so never flake.

So how to avoid flakes? Raise your SMV or hit on uglier women. Your SMV is the total package you present to a girl as man. It is a sum of your value plus your game. If you want to stop the hotter girls flaking you need to:

Work on your game. Open lots of sets, and the next day (not the same night) analyse what you could have done better. Get advice on people who are better than you if you can, or read the better PUA blogs out there.
Work on your value. Gym. Fashion. Grooming. Career. Lifestyle.
If you were looking for a quick fix, plug and play technique like the ones I mentioned at the beginning of the post to cut down flaking, I don’t think they exist. It’s going to take real work on your part.

1320810019.0,182,self.seduction,m5o6b,"""We"": The Single Greatest IOI I Know",205,23,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/m5o6b/we_the_single_greatest_ioi_i_know/,"I wish I could find an article to back up what I'm saying but this just comes from experience. Let me tell a few stories. If you want the TL;DR it will be in bold at the bottom.

**Story 1**: A while back I was driving out from my college to a friend's party out at their parents' farm. The drive was already lengthy and was made even more so by the fact that the driver I was with got incredibly lost. There was the driver, myself, and a girl I had a crush on for a while (we'll call her ""Janice""), pretty much chilling and trying to not disappear off into the woods forever. To pass the time we started talking about the driver's new boyfriend, and Janice and I start giving the driver shit, turning everything she said into a dirty joke. Janice was laughing at all my stupid jokes, copying my mannerisms when she delivered her own jokes, all solid IOIs by themselves. But then somewhere inside that conversation, in the quiet following a pretty huge laugh-session, Janice says with warm sincerity **""We make a good team, Coover""**. Later that evening the whole party was abuzz with the rumor that Janice was feeling something for me. Were it not for complicated romantic conditions at the time I would've acted.

**Story 2**: While I was traveling down South I wound up about 3 hours away from a long-distance, super hot friend of mine (We'll call her ""Jane""). Even though I was still 3 hours away she drove every damn mile to come visit me (a solid IOI), and later when we went to a bar Jane insisted to buy all my drinks (another solid IOI). Despite all this I was still uncertain because, well, I had it in my head that she was way out of my league. But when we finished drinking and started walking back to where I was crashing, Jane laughed at a joke I make in reference to a book and jokingly said (as she grabbed my shoulder) **""Oh, Coover. It's so nice to have someone smart to talk to. We are so much better than everyone else in this town!""**. An hour later we were making out.

**Story 3**: Out at a bar with friends, including a girl, we'll call her ""Melanie"", that I'd been friends with for a long time. Recently, however, I noticed feelings were changing. I started noticing her in a more sexual way, and she'd been making several comments recently about how much my appearance had changed and how good I looked (again, solid IOI). But it was the ""We"" statements in front of other friends that made me think there was more going on: **""Coover and I have been friends for a long time. We have done so much together and we have always been there for each other""**. That night we made out.

**Theory: When a Woman Stops Talking About ""I"" or ""You"" and Starts Talking About ""We"", She Wants You**. Women, or at least the women I tend to attract, look for compatibility in potential sexual partners. A way they subconsciously express this desire for compatibility, and how they try to plant this idea of compatibility in **your** head and in **friends'** heads is through the use of **""We"" Statements**.

There are lots of IOIs that I've gotten good at noticing through experience but this is the one common one out of all my recent hook-ups, and, as the stories show, seems to indicate that they are ready to go there and then, as soon as you get a private moment with them. 

Of course you don't need to wait for the lady to start using ""We"" statements. Start using them yourself to plant the idea in **her** head. A few strategically placed ""We"" statements in a conversation will take all the tension to the next level.

We is powerful. Or is it ARE powerful?

**TL;DR: You will know she is attracted to you when she stops saying ""I"" or ""You"" and starts saying ""We"". Your primary goal in psychological seduction is to escalate things to ""We""-talk.**

I just had a good date tonight. I met her on OKCupid. She's cute, but not beautiful. Mostly, we just really clicked. I *like* her. And she likes me back. I know because we made out after I walked her home.

I just wanted to weigh in and say something really important:

**Don't get too caught up in reading this stuff.**

There are guys on this subreddit who are *insanely* good. Like, I just read a post by a guy who knows how to create naked parties. That's pretty fucking cool, and I wish I could do that. I *can't* do that yet. I don't have the skills. When I read his post, or for that matter, ANY post by an advanced guy, part of me thinks, ""Wow that's cool!"" and another part of me thinks, ""I'm nowhere near that level, I'm a fucking loser.""

If you're at all like me, you're a perfectionist. That shit will RUIN you in dating, especially if you read seddit a lot. Every post by an advanced guy who pulls off awesome stuff will make you feel like you're less than worthy. Ignore it.

Go out, show your interest, and just *try.* **Women are very forgiving!** My date, for instance... I'm not very good at kino. I'm not slick, I'm not suave, and I'm not smooth. What I AM is willing to overcome that awkward feeling and actually do it. And you know what? Women appreciate it. You're giving them feedback, ""Hey, I like you. I feel like this is going well."" You can even say that! That's how honest, direct, openly communicative adults talk to each other on a date.

The whole point is this: don't compare yourself to seddit rockstars pulling stupid amounts of ass. Embrace who you are, go after what you want, and *just... try.* ",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_19g9x4,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/19g9x4/you_just_have_to_try_thats_it/,

As I passed her, neither of us looked away (ignore the fact that I obviously wasn't watching where I was going during this time). Now, I had failed earlier today in an attempt to talk to a cute girl and didn't want to fail again.



I TURNED MY CAR AROUND and drove slowly up to the sidewalk. I tried to come up with something to say to ask for her number in the timespan of a few seconds. I could only think of one. I rolled down my window and smiled at her.


""Excuse me,"" I said, ""I think I lost my number. Can I have yours?""




That's right. I used a pick-up line on her.




She smiled and said ""Haha, that's good!"" And kept walking. Now, I wasn't just doing this as a confidence booster. I genuinely wanted her number and wasn't going to throw in the towel after the first round.




Although thrown off my game, I still pressed on. ""So... what do you say?"" Followed by another confident smile.




She paused. ""Oh, why not!"" She said, and told me her number. I told her ""Great,"" we said goodbye and I drove off. 



Later on I texted her. ""Well, usually I don't give out my number,"" (they all say that) ""but that was pretty ballsy!"" We texted a bit more and I asked her to coffee. I'm picking her up tomorrow.




What have I taken away from this? It really is true that with confidence, you can say or do anything (regardless of how creepy you think it is) and come across as smooth.

I don't get paid to teach and I haven't written any books. However! I have been VERY successful over the years using the methods I will describe to you. This is NOT 'perfect' or 'textbook' game but I have field tested these theories on my own time and have consistently well with them.

**Introduction**: This guide will TRY to steer away from specific, on the spot game. The use of an opener and transition leading into attraction over a couple hour period is NOT the focus of this post. This guide is to broaden the scope of your thinking and REALLY cashing in on the further ripples of your actions.

**What is Long Term and Social Circle Game?** Both of these terms refers to sleeping with girls that you have known for awhile or at least well after your first encounter. Except that Social Circle Management can have really solid tie ins with single-night F-Closes. More on that later.

**Long Term Game** This is all I know how to call it. There may be a better term for it but this one is mine so you get to deal with it for now! Long Term Game does NOT help us for random encounters in the club. Keep to your Seddit 101s for that stuff. This does however work wonders for co-workers, social circle friends, friends of the family, that cute girl at the cash register you see twice a week, etc etc. Any regular interaction.

A) The key to this is to be entirely unflappable. I know rejection is hard to handle and you can cry into your pillow afterward if you want but as far as public opinion is concerned, nothing phases you. You are literally so awesome that no single girl can affect you negatively. This does two things for you: 1. It makes your image in their mind not get any worse. Many guys mess up really bad here and after they get what I call 'Soft Rejected' meaning a rejection that definitely isn't final, they show serious remorse or try to save the sinking ship by doing all sorts of stupid things, hence turning it into a 'hard rejection', one that you can never come back from. And 2. This sets you up for potential future action with the first girl and keeps your image solid for your social circle. All good things.

B) Do NOT rush progress with your targets. If you go full speed on a co worker and fail, not only did you not win the race but you crashed your car and will never cross any finish line in that circle. You have effectively closed off your other co workers because you tried to close the deal and now you have tainted the circle. This is what people mean by ""Don't shit where you eat."" And it's true... for rookies. You need to be thinking in the long term. No pressure involved what so ever. Simply create value by always showing your strengths and hiding weaknesses. I'm going to give you the run down of my work set up:

I'm a server at a restaurant. I show value through story telling, my physical strength and athleticism, my wit and my 'unflappable' attitude. Bad customers simply make me laugh, I'm NEVER sick (That they know of) and I'm VERY public with my sexuality. Showing value is a standard Seduction skill and wont be covered here. The only difference is you don't have a time limit on showing your value, you simply have to display it consistently and you will reap the benefits over time. 

C) DISPLAY YOUR SEXUALITY! This is VERY important because you want people to identify you as a sexual person. This makes sure that the 'friendzone' curse never fully takes root. There are many ways to do this while ALSO showing value. You can tell a story about a 'good friend you used to sleep with' where you guys were fooling around in public and almost got caught! Oh man! Good times! Stories like these show that you are able to sleep with your friends, have a good time and STAY friends while also showing that you have a freakier side (Girls LOVE THIS). Talk about your sexuality, not as something objective but as fact. 

Brunette Girl: LiveBreatheOwn, are you going to sleep with that customer?
LiveBreatheOwn: Ha, no way. (Yes I am) I would if she wasn't incredibly stupid. I prefer my brunettes to be intelligent and not mistake them for blondes.

This small bit of dialogue does wonders. In HER mind: I am a sexual person and I DO hook up and am ABLE to hook up because it's clear this customer finds me attractive. I have standards and I just happen to prefer girls with her hair color that have intelligence. So when the time DOES come to close the deal, she will see it as a huge compliment to both her looks and her intelligence. It's a win/win.

**Social Circle Management**: This coincides with long term game in the sense that you don't reap the benefits right away. What this will do is provide for you a support system that will get you laid even without them knowing they are your support system. They will be your thralls and not even be aware of it.

A) Create NON-SEXUAL Value within your circle, no matter how lame the context is. Are you the best Starcraft player in your friend circle? Are you the best fighter? In the best shape? Can you do the longest handstand? Dance? ANYTHING?! If you don't have any actual skills, get a fucking skill and make sure people know you are good at it. This will allow every single one of your friends to pre-qualify you to every new and old girl in the circle. 

Friend: ""Hey Stephanie this is my friend LiveBreatheOwn, he's the awesome dancer I told you about!""
LiveBreatheOwn: ""I'm not sure what he's talking about, you aren't allowed to watch me dance and steal my moves.""

I chose this dialogue because no matter what I say, I can't disprove what my friend has already said. She came into this situation KNOWING I'm a good dancer. So when I downplay it, it shows nothing but humility and as long as you say it confidently and with a good smile, she will know you can dance regardless of what you say. And later on in the night when I pull out a few dance moves, I've already skipped over Intro / Transition and I've built a ton of attraction. Nothing left to do but swoop in and seal the deal.

B) ""It takes 10 times as many resources to gain a new customer as it does to retain an existing one."" My old mentor told me this one time when referring to business but I immediately applied this to my Social Circle Game. DO. NOT. BURN. BRIDGES. Keep your 'customers' close and USE them! I've been sleeping with a group of 4 or 5 girls since HIGH SCHOOL (Multiple years ago) and never have I burned bridges with them. When they would get a boyfriend, I would be happy for them and express it! (Be unflappable) And when I would get a girlfriend, I would always make sure they were around in my life and I never treated them awkwardly. This has made sure that I have always had a steady source of sex at all times. While one girl is dating someone, the other is single. Do not be offended when they date other people and comfort them in their times of jealousy and make sure they know they are special to you.

C) Word of mouth is the best form of publicity. This goes back to prequalification but it extends over a longer period of time. My social circle KNOWS I am a sexual person, it's public knowledge. I've made sure that my in-circle sexual partners are always satisfied to the best of my ability and I've never been exposed as someone who gets offended or basis relationships off of sex. And because of this, my referral program is up and running. I can't tell you the times I've been texted, ""Hey I was talking to my friend about sex and how she needs a fuck buddy so I told her about you, can I give her your number?""

So here I am, at my desk playing with my self and I get a text... and I number close?! I've ALREADY #-Closed because of how well I treated my hook-up-social-circle over a year ago. The girl who sent the text has been in a relationship for months but when the subject comes up, she knows I'm an unflappable, drama free, high quality sexual partner to refer to her friends.

**Closing**: I initially meant for this guide to be significantly more organized but it's a difficult concept for me to get across without using a thousand examples and a thousand more scenarios blah blah. What I hope I've accomplished is to add another level to your game thinking. That it isn't about who you fuck tomorrow, it's about who you sleep with throughout next year or next decade.

This guide was written ASSUMING you already have a basic concept of the PUA core skills and use them regularly. This is an extension to your game, not a replacement. That being said, I know that much of what I wrote was broad-strokes so I am more than willing to answer any questions or clarify anything I've said here. I hope this goes well, I've been going back and forth with posting this for about a month now but I figured nothing ventured is nothing gained.

She laughs and is really trying to avoid the word from now on. Of course the word keeps slipping out and every time it happens, I point to my cheek and get a kiss.

the age-old ""what to say"" question.",221,42,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ilz86/a_post_on_the_alphamale_confidence_building_and/,"I'm hoping that by the end of this post I'll be able to tie everything I say together So bare with me and hopefully my epiphanies won't be useless to everyone. I don't think that every thought i have is necessarily 100% correct, so as with all things you read on here, you should take this with a grain of salt. Take what helps and discard the rest, as they say.

**The ""Alpha-Male""**

A lot of people have their own definitions. None of these are necessarily inherently wrong. A lot of people also have certain requirements that constitute their definition of an Alpha, rather than a concrete definition. Whatever works for you is what you should go with I think. But I do have some relatively simple thoughts on the subject.

So what is alpha to me? It's simple: An alpha is any man who is themselves, un-apologetically. This may seem obvious, but think about it. A lot of times we try to put on our pickup persona when talking to women. Or our professional persona when dealing with cashiers or acquaintances, rather than just relaxing. The fact of the matter is that a lot of these things you learn in the community will flow somewhat naturally if you can learn to be yourself, and make no apologies for that.

I find that the best way to achieve this for me, has been to think of a girl you are good friends with but are not attracted to. Visualize that every girl you talk to is that girl. Bust on her, make fun of her, tell her your random thoughts, be your quirky self. Do whatever you would do if it actually was her. Be unapologetic about it. We're guys. Half the shit that goes through our head makes no sense. But let me tell you, guys: you're better off telling her you're thinking about how many twix bars you could eat before you die, than trying to play it cool. Goofy is OK and very beneficial in moderation. Humor loosens people up.

I'd like to say more but I don't want to over-complicate this simple message.

tl;dr let your thoughts flow and don't be apologetic about it.

**Confidence-Building**

I want to talk you guys through an exercise. This exercise isn't some miracle cure that will solve your problems overnight. But what it will do is that if you're still having trouble with confidence it may help you to identify your insecurities, and to discover some things holding you back that you may not have known were there.

This is a little embarrassing for me, as I'm not a big fan of sharing insecurities so no laughing, sedditors =D

The other day I was sitting at work, killing a little time until I had to do something in about 20 minutes. I had an idea. I started to picture myself. I pictured myself with a great girlfriend, laying in bed next to her. Specifics really weren't an issue here. I imagined I was having a bad day, and I was complaining to her about how I felt about things, about insecurities or what have you. I thought about what I wished I could hear from somebody that cared about me. I realized that if I had a loving girlfriend, I would love for her to tell me that I wasn't alone, I wasn't weird, I could handle school, I could handle a career, I would someday make a good father, that I was worth loving, that I was good looking and worthy of beautiful women etc etc.

Then I had a sort of epiphany, which may seem obvious to all of you but to me it was a game-changer. I realized, that if hearing these things from a loving girlfriend someday would be so great, why couldn't I feel these things about myself? So for the first time in my life, I was sitting there at work with nobody around and I said to myself out loud (and really really meant it) ""I know you'll make a good father, I know you can do it and that's all you need"" (because becoming a father is something that's always scared me personally.)

Anyways, my point in telling that whole story (even though it's slightly embarrassing for me) is that you don't need anybody else to affirm positive things about yourself. You have to find out what's holding you back, and really work towards being able to affirm these things for yourself. If a beautiful woman telling you you're sexy would shoot your confidence through the roof, then trust me you CAN tell yourself the same thing and it will have no less effect. It's just a matter of getting yourself to actually feel it. If you can tell yourself these things just ONE time, and really mean it then it will change everything.

Now this may be lame, but I want you to close your eyes. When you do, I want you to picture yourself laying in bed, next to a beautiful girlfriend who is crazy about you. Imagine you're complaining to her, and you're feeling like total shit. Imagine she is crazy in love with you and is telling you all the right things, making you feel so much better about yourself. What is she telling you? (If it helps, for reference to yourself and others, feel free to list them here) Write these things down. Find a way to feel these things about yourself. Some may not take long, others may take some work. Every time you cross one off the list you'll feel like a new man.

If you can knock a lot of these out, it's amazing the effect it will have. Strangely, confidence is new to me. I have a LONG way to go, because I've only really crossed off maybe 2 of the things on my quite long list. But with every increase in my confidence, my head races a little bit less around people. I am a little more calm, a little more un-reactive, and a little more attractive. It's almost like a super-power to those of us who have never felt it before.

tl;dr This one I want you to read, no tl;dr this time

In an effort to tie these things all together, I want to talk about the ever ""what to say"" question.

The short answer: whatever the fuck you want. Say you're in class sitting next to a girl you're interested in. Imagine that girl is the girl you're friends with but not attracted to. What would you say if she was? Say that. What you say doesn't matter. If you're thinking about damn... i dunno... pillows, then ask her about pillows. Who cares. You don't, because you're talking to a girl you're comfortable with but not attracted to. You don't need her affirmations of your good qualities, because you've already given them to yourself. The power of just being yourself un-apologetically is unbelievable.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the positive feedback guys, hopefully this helps some of you. I wanted to add something to this that I just saw that I feel ties into what I said about being yourself unapologetically and I think does a much better job of getting to the core of it. So here's a TED talk you may be interested in: http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability.html it's crazy just how closely it relates to what I say. Definitely worth the watch it may be game-changing for you ;) I wouldn't say I agree with every word, but a lot of the stuff in there is very useful/interesting. Also, I don't remember what subreddit this was posted in earlier that led me to it, but if anybody knows, then credit to them. I'm too lazy to look.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_ilz86,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ilz86/a_post_on_the_alphamale_confidence_building_and/,

I was going to write an awesome post about alpha body language and tonality as a follow up to [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/)

And then I received this really good article via the [RSD](http://www.realsocialdynamics.com) newsletter and I realized they did the work for me.

So the rest of this is 100% their material, written by [Brad Branson](http://www.bradbranson.com/). 

Rather than go into detail on each point, if you want more info on any of the 35 points listed, ask questions below AMA style. I am sure someone here will be able to flesh them out for you.

Without further ado:

---

**35 WAYS TO CONVEY VALUE**
 
(1) **Non-submissive eye contact**
-no darting of the eyes when you look at her, no breaking eye 
contact first.
 
(2)  **Vocal Projection**
-the loudest guy in a group is usually the most comfortable, 
unstifled, and highest value.
 
(3) **Commanding and Challenging (Breaking Rapport) Tonality**
-commanding authoritative tonality puts you in the same category as 
other high value people.

it gets her to respond in a qualifying tone, which subconsciously 
she rationalizes that she must like you because she only talks with 
people like that if they are high value.
 
(4)  **Unreactivity**
-not socially pinging off of the girl.  Your state is not dependent 
on her reaction to you. Be the yacht.
 
(5)  **Who's reacting to who more**
-who's laughing quicker at the others jokes, who's more into the 
conversation, who's giving subtle indicators that they like the 
other.  The one reacting more is lower value, similar to...
 
(6)  **Who's more in their head, who's not**
-this is the same as above but internally, things like vomiting 
words gets her trying to piece together the conversation.  The more 
non sequitar, the more she is in her head trying to understand what 
you are saying, this is why it is so important to...
 
(7)  **Lead the conversation**
-you have control of what is being said.  I call it channeling the 
river, steering the conversation in the direction that moves the 
interaction forward as opposed to just being a little bitch and 
talking about whatever just so you can keep the conversation alive.
 
(8)  **Good body language**
-when you feel comfortable and confident you are naturally going to 
take up more space and have good body language, for similar reasons 
it is important to have a larger...
 
(9)  **Physical presence**
-guys that are alpha just take up more space.  You can see in a 
group the most alpha guy might have 2-3 feet of space between him 
and the next guy, where as the more stifled insecure person takes up 
very little space.  This is also noticeable in how much physical 
movement you use, hand gestures and just ease of movement in general.
 
(10)  **Bringing your state from within**
-similar to 4 and 5, you aren't relying on anyone or the environment 
to pump your emotional state, you feel good because of your own 
awesomeness, and the law of state transfermakes everyone happy 
around you as well.  This relates to...
 
(11)  **Self amusement**
-the opposite of self amusement is reaction seeking.  Reaction 
seeking is neediness and a low value trait.  Self amusement is 
purely for your own enjoyment because you don't care about anyone 
else and just bathe in your own awesomeness, you do not seek 
reactions to make yourself feel good.
 
(12)  **Stating your opinion**
-a high value person is more likely to state their opinion, purely 
because it comes from them, as opposed to a low value person who 
doesn't think anyone cares what they have to say.
 
(13)  **Statements not questions**
-statements are always more authoritative than questions, and who 
knows, you might give a cold read that is accurate, you tell her she 
looks like a nurse and she is, and she'll think it's fate that you 
two met.
 
(14)  **Lowering the bar for what you talk about**
-again vomit words.  The more bullshit things you say, the more it 
conveys that you don't care about the interaction, or the girls 
response to what you say.  It shows that you talk to girls like her 
all the time, or probably have a couple on speed dial.
 
(15)  **Conveying intent**
 -by showing that you aren't afraid to convey intent, it conveys that 
you are willing to be vulnerable and put your personality on the 
line, something only someone with high self esteem would feel 
comfortable doing.
 
(16)  **Commanding attention**
-don't compromise your value just to keep her talking.  If she isn't 
looking at you, call her out.  If she is on her phone, call her out.  
A high value person assumes that when he is talking people listen.  
If there is a dissonance, he takes action.
 
(17)  **Being as comfortable, or more comfortable than the girl**
-no leaning in to hear her, no standing while she is sitting.  Get 
comfortable, relax, she should be excited to talk to someone as cool 
as you, not the other way around.
 
(18)  **Entitlement**
-you feel entitled to the girl.  You fully assume that she is yours, 
and you are not emotionally affected by any response she has towards 
you either positive or negative.  The byproduct of this is...
 
(19)  **Indifference**
-again, you are emotionally indifferent to her reactions towards you.  
This conveys a level of abundance, in the fact that you probably 
have other girls, so she doesn't have as much value to you.
 
(20)  **Lack of outcome dependence**
- 18 and 19 explain why you have no emotional reaction to anything 
she says, and this has inherent social proof/value.
 
(21)  **Authentic conversation**
-I talked about this last week in the spectrum of authenticity 
article.  The more authentic and real you are, the more vulnerable 
you are and the more balls it takes.
 
(22)  **Full frontal positioning**
-none of that old skool bullshit about body rocking and over the 
shoulder openers.  Go in direct, straight in there, face to face, 
and make yourself vulnerable.
 
(23)  **Passing shit/congruence tests**
-Alex used to say that 80% of ""natural"" game is passing congruence 
tests, and every time you pass a test, attraction goes up.

remember congruence tests are more than the obvious ""Is that your 
pickup line?!"" there are also the more subtle ones like not making 
good eye contact, staring at her phone, or initial unreceptivity at 
the beginning of an interaction.  The best way to respond is by...
 
(24)  **Being unapologetic**
-when you go through life by your own standards, you don't try to 
please people, you just tell it like it is.  Some girl gives you 
shit, you call her out, people don't listen,you tell them to pay 
attention.  This is because...
 
(25)  **Don't identify yourself based on other peoples opinions**
-do you see how these are byproducts of each other, somewhat 
overlapping?  This is why it is all so powerful, it creates a web of 
beliefs, or a rigid unwavering belief system.
 
(26)  **Escalation**
-more leading here.  Having that detachment from the outcome to the 
point where you aren't emotionally affected if you go to escalate 
and don't get it.
 
another way of saying this is to cultivate an...
 
(27) **Abundance mindset**
-now I've had my fair share of virgins on bootcamp, and they always 
ask how they can have an abundance mindset if they obviously aren't 
doing very well in the success with women category.
 
but it's not abundance directly with women, it's abundance in the 
fact that you have trust in your skillset to get another girl if it 
doesn't work out with the one in front of you.
 
(28)  **Congruence**
-who's frame is stronger, yours or hers?  

whoever holds the frame unwaveringly wins, and is more congruent in 
how they act, knows themselves better, and trusts their own judgment over others.
 
(29)  **Non-judgemental**
-being judgmental of her sluttiness, or ANYTHING sort of judgment, 
is a sign of naivety and of someone who hasn't seen much of the 
world or experienced life.
 
this is why travel is a great way to develop a stronger frame, life 
experience makes you much more...
 
(30)  **Comfortable in your own skin**
-this is also why as you get older, as long as you are working on 
yourself, you only get more attractive.  You've experienced more in 
life, and when something you don't expect happens in the interaction, 
you deal with it accordingly, without anxiety, without stress.
 
(31)  **Walking through the world with ease**
-someone that has his shit together isn't going to be stressed.  
Betas are stressed in life, worried about surviving and pissed they 
aren't the alpha, while the alpha gorilla just chills back and lives 
the good life.
 
(32)  **Standing out, be unique**
-society conditions us to be average, to be beta.  Throw away the 
stripey shirts, throw away the khakis, get a little sex appeal.
 
(33)  **Being comfortable with silence**
-not feeling like you need to keep talking if you have nothing to 
say, you are just as cool chilling with your own awesomeness, when 
the conversation stops for a moment, it gives you an opportunity to 
remember how cool you are.
 
(33)  **Dominance**
-what is dominance?  The opposite is submission, and therefore 
proactively leading the interaction leads to her submitting, one way 
that you can show that you aren't afraid to take a risk is by...
 
(34)  **Leading**
-to lead is to take a risk, if you go for it, let's say moving her 
to the bar, you might not get it, and a low value person, someone 
not comfortable with themselves, would be afraid to try.
 
(35)  **Assuming attraction**
-there is inherent social proof based on how you interact with the 
girl.  If you are interacting with her in a way that you are 
assuming she likes you, she will deduce that other girls that look 
like her usually like you as well.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_fphve,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fphve/lesson_2_alpha_body_language_tonality_and_more/,
1359914573.0,175,self.seduction,17tdbr,"[FR] House party, social proof, and a f-close",243,68,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/17tdbr/fr_house_party_social_proof_and_a_fclose/,"Context: Typical house party, not many people there (maybe 20 or 30 throughout, 60 at peak) and even less girls. Not the most conducive environment to pick up in, but we play the cards we're dealt. People started showing up around 8, most had arrived by 10.

Probably the most important part of this night was that I was just going to the party to have a good time and wing for my friend. I wasn't dependent on getting a girl, and I was going to have an awesome time either way. This let me get in state pretty quick, and by the time people had arrived I was in a great mood.

Started off by catching up with an old friend (HB6) and visibly having a good interaction with her. I was giving her shit about how she is so old (24 to my 22) and can't even do shots any more. Ended up doing 2 shots with her, two HB7s, and a HB8.

Some time passes, a bunch more people arrive, and I go behind the bar and start help serving people. The HB8 from before comes up and asks for a drink,

HB8: Can I have a (some mix drink)?

Me: (Acting offended) Wow, you just come up and treat me as if I'm a bartender or something.

Her: Well, you are behind the bar.

Me: (slight pause) Good point. What's your name?

Conversation then lasts for a minute or two with me just playing around with her, keeping the conversation light. We talked a bit about what she likes to do (dance) and I teased her saying that it wasn't a sport. We laugh and I make her drink telling her I'd see her later. Kept it short, established some interest, good to go. This further served a point because everyone else coming up to the bar saw me interacting with her, which established some good social proof.

Flash forward a bit later and my buddy is going for this HB8. But she is with a HB7 and I walk by, overhearing that they are living in the same (two person) apartment. I figure I'd help out and try to take the HB7 away to give my friend a one-on-one with the HB8. A few minutes later, I approach the trio, still standing in the same place. I make eye contact with the HB7 from really far away, and hold it the entire time as I walk up. She does one of the quick glimpses down as though to check me out, and from this I decided to just be quick about it. I ask if she wants to dance, offering my hand. She agrees and we dance and talk for a few songs. She's giving off some strong signals that she wants me, so I go straight for a kiss. Make out on the dance floor for a bit, then once the song ends I tell her I have to go to the bathroom.

I go to my buddy's room for a bit and hang low for a few minutes. I leave the room and nearly immediately find the HB7. I smile and ask if she wants to go back to my place, and I get the quickest ""yes"" I've gotten in a while. Go back, close, and all is good.

The key to this being successful was establishing myself as high value from the beginning. I wasn't going hard for any women, I was just having a good time. I made sure to keep the conversations public, witty, and fun to establish good impressions with both the girl I was conversing with and whoever witnessed the conversation. By building a solid social reputation at the house party with everyone, it made my job much easier whenever I was talking to any individual. Heck, it made my work with the HB7 almost too easy (and I was assured that she is anything but).

Last Night i went to a hookah bar with a few friends, 3 guys 2 girls all just out to have a good time. Its a hookah bar so the whole atmosphere is just pretty chill overall, but about 30 minutes into our session a second group gets sat on our floor and along with this group comes who i will refer to as ""Fedora Guy"". This guy was dressed as if he came out of the dumpster behind Mystery's house. He had on a Fedora, Aviators( Inside, in a dark room at night) and a big guady ring on every finger. This guy is obviously out of his element and is really trying to ""fake it til he makes it"" He's doing alpha things, but he has a complete lack on inner game and you can sense that there's something off about how he's acting. He starts asking our group questions like ""who would win in a fight? will ferrell or mark walburg"" at first were willing to answer these questions to be nice, but by the 3rd we just start ignoring him which only eggs him on more, he's an attention whore. He goes downstairs and starts demanding songs be played. He then comes back up and starts this really crappy [hard-step](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh1Ob15vl8E) in the middle of a chil hookah lounge which is really thowing off the vibe making everyone uncomfortable. Even his friends are trying to hide the fact that hes with them, he then drops and does like 10 pushups. At this point it was late so we decided to leave but theres a lesson to be taken from this guy. 

1. fake it until you become it is a good mantra but you must be your own alpha, don't do things because you feel like an alpha would do them.  This guy was talking loud, and dancing by himself because of the ""I'm alpha and i dont give a fuck"" mentality. Nothing comes off as more beta, than trying to be alpha.

2. don't look for peoples approval. The entire time this guy was dancing and doing push ups he was looking around to see if people were watching him and showed a complete lack of self confidence.

3. work on your inner game. A house is nothing without a foundation and this guy was nothing without an inner game. Sure he peacocked himself and tried to do whatever the fuck he wanted to but it all felt so shallow and cheap, this guy had blaring self confidence issues and all the rings and fedoras in the world can't cover that up.

I called her a week ago and made a coffee date. My plan was to go in and escalate till rejection. Well I was stupid and forgot about the date and stood her up. She was mad.

A week later, after several apologies, she invites me to go out clubbing with her friends. I show up at 11 and she's not there yet. So I start talking to people. 

I start talking to a group of Italians (two guys three girls) and start gaming the girls in front of the guys. One of the guys loves it and says I have balls and that I should go for his friend. I start escalating quickly and I try to kiss her. Rejected, but she doesn't want me to leave. She tells me I'm too fun and keeps telling me to stay. I ask her to dance, she says she's too sober. I leave.

Oneitis shows up, I find her on the dance-floor and I grab her hand and pull her in.  We've known each other for a while, so I escalate quickly. Dance with her, pull her in, then push her away, do this for a while then pull her in and try to kiss her. Rejected. She says she wants to but she got back with her ex (she broke up with him 2 months ago). She asks me if it's ok if we just stay as friends. I say yes because I actually enjoy her company. 

I was disappointed and a bit mad to say the least. But instead of going home feeling dejected, I entered DGAF mode. I saw a hot tall girl (easily 5'10, and I'm 5'5) and grabbed her hand and asked for her name. She clearly liked me so this went down pretty easily. We talked for 2 minutes (where she's from age etc.) and I tease her mercilessly for bad guesses of my age/occupation/etc., I never give her a straight answer before a tease her a bit. I also escalate kino quickly, hands on arms, grab her hands, then her waist, then her thights, then her neck etc.

I grab her hand and tell her we're going to dance. This must have looked hilarious because grinding on her was a chore (she's way too tall). We dance for a bit, I grab her hand, twist her around, and kiss her. All this was happening in front of Oneitis and her face showed that she wasn't pleased (although I honestly didn't plan to rub it in her face or anything, it just happened). We break apart for a bit.

Around 20 minutes later, I see tall girl about to leave the club. I grab her and put her in-between these two polls at the bar, trap her there, push her towards the bar and continue to kiss her (it started getting messy and really touchey) so I asked her ""Do you want to come over"".
She stared at me for a good minute, and I held eye contact like a champ until she looked away. She then asks me ""Where do you live?"" I tell her, she says she can't and that she has 9:00AM class and that I live too far. I say cool, give her my phone, she puts her # in. As she leave's she grabs me by the neck and pulls me into a short makeout and then leaves.

I go to get my coat, see a cute girl waiting for her friends, start talking to her. She's Belgian and on exchange, we talk for 4 minutes. I tell her we should get drinks next week. She says she can't because she has a boyfriend. Italian guy from the beginning of the night finds me again as I'm waiting at coat check. He says You're awesome, give me your Facebook, and we should go hit on girls together sometime.  I say sure, give him my info, get my coat, and go home.

1318716286.0,177,self.seduction,ldip7,Lessons learned from my first months of seduction.,228,51,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ldip7/lessons_learned_from_my_first_months_of_seduction/,"My mindset has changed a lot since I've started with pickup. Here's what I learned so far.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**Seduction is a practical approach to get women.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
There is no magic bullet. If you want something, you have to work for it. Also, seduction is an art that helps me get on well with people *in general* and being more social.

Seduction techniques can be used for so much more. I've successfully seduced my boss when I messed up and I got the chance to meet a lot of different people. 95% responded positively to a cold approach. I help my new contacts and they help me. Seduction made me become a better conversationalist. It helped me reconnect with old friends. Outcome independence taught me to be a value giver instead of a value taker.   


---------------------------------------------------------------
**She must like the person I am.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
I will constantly improve myself. I'm a really bad dancer. I look like a blindfolded mule on acid on the dancefloor (I'm likely not exaggerating). These things don't come natural to me, so I have to convince myself every fucking time to do it. But I will strive to become better in everything I do. Thanks for helping me so far.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**That girl is out of my league.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
How can I be sure if I don't approach?  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I can't approach because I need to find the perfect opener first.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
There is no perfect opener. In fact, openers are the least important thing when approaching. Instead I now focus on my body language and the vibe of the conversation and keep it casual and funny. I hold eye contact and react confident. It's all about inner game. [Here's a great BBC Documentation on body language.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQENwD-QlRA&amp;feature=related)  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**She's busy. I can't approach.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
That's an excuse. Most of the time, *everybody* looks busy. Some people even feel *uncomfortable* not doing anything. OK, so she's typing something on her phone? Take out yours, type ""hello"" and show her. She's reading a bus plan? Tell her when the next bus will arrive. Whatever. Dude, live is short. You might never see her again. If you don't approach, she won't either. You don't feel ready? You'll never be. Nobody will officially approve your *readiness*. Doing the next step is always risky - that's part of the fun. Nobody cares if you fail. It sounds strange but some might even admire you for having the guts to approach her.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I have to create comfort before physical contact.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
No. Don't make a big deal out of it. The moment you feel comfortable touching her, might come too late. Women evaluate your physical presence. They can't help but instantly classify you. If you appear clingy or needy, it's over. But if your body language does not express what you're saying that's a red flag. Touching should be a natural form of human interaction.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**Oops! She has a boyfriend. I'll leave her alone.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
She *says* she has a boyfriend. Let's find out if it's a shit test. Keep your frame. You only want to meet interesting people, right? ;)  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I have her number. She likes me.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Getting her number is only a tiny step. She gives it to the plumber. You should never settle for mediocracy. Try to go further after having the number.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I will cherish and indulge her for the rest of my life.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Do that...after you had sex with her. This has nothing to do with being an asshole or a womanizer. The problem here is that she must under all circumstances see you as a possible lover not a caretaker in the beginning. This will make things so much easier in the long run. You can move on to make a physical connection and if she rejects you, that's fine, too. She saved both of you a lot of time.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I'm moving too fast.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
That's highly unlikely. She will tell you, when to stop. Instead, you should move as fast as possible. For example, every bit of smalltalk will lower your chances. Everybody is bored by it. Avoid it like a desease. If you don't bond with her on an emotional level during the first two minutes, your intentions are not clear and the discussion will feel awkard. The most important thing is calibration. If she's shy, try an honest compliment to bring her out of her shell. She's throwing a shit test? Try cocky funny and keep your frame. Playing Gentleman or Bad Boy depends on the situation.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**If she stops me, it's over.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
Nah, she just might not be ready yet. I always have a second chance.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**Getting rejected is painful.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
No. It's normal. She hasn't rejected your personality, she just didn't want to fuck you. In fact after I realized that whole thing is just a game, it can be quite amusing. At least I have a story to tell and I had the balls to approach.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
**I will never find another woman as pretty/intelligent/friendly as her.**

---------------------------------------------------------------
There are plenty of fish in the sea. Until now I've always found somebody even better. Go out and meet people. No, I mean it! Go out and get some new friends.

1271097927.0,177,self.seduction,bpx0p,Exercise: Touch everyone you talk to,204,27,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/bpx0p/exercise_touch_everyone_you_talk_to/,"Being a recovering introvert and nerd, I've found most pickup and seduction advice really hard to execute on, including the elaborate ""kino"" schemes like the rings game and other overly complicated techniques. But, over the past year, I've been doing a job that has me occasionally meeting hundreds of people in a single day, and I've noticed something amazing: If you touch someone, briefly and in a non-threatening way, they will instantly like you better. It really does work most of the time.

Turns out, there's science behind this. When you touch someone, you give them value, it lowers their blood pressure and increases their serotonin levels, making them happier and more relaxed. Google ""touch and serotonin"" if you have doubts. This increase in happiness makes getting a smile or a laugh out of someone *much* easier and it increases the level of trust between you.

I'm not sure about the science regarding its effect on the person doing the touching, but I think it must have similar effects. I feel more confident talking to someone when I touch them, and the conversation seems to go more smoothly when the opportunity for touch is there. I recently had a difficult interaction with a cute bartender (nothing terrible, it just didn't go anywhere and she seemed a bit surly), and I think it came down to me being more nervous and less confident without the touch since she was on the other side of the bar and I was seated, so there was no natural way to add touch to the interaction. Of course, my inability to make a great conversation with her (even with the social proof of already being with girls) without the crutch of being able to touch her is something I'll work on, but I'm definitely not going to give up touch whenever it is possible.

What I've noticed is that it works everywhere and with every conversation. So, now, whenever I talk to *anyone* for more than one sentence (bus driver, restaurant greeter, people I meet on the street, male or female), I will briefly touch their shoulder, arm, or back with a soft open palm. It fits very comfortably into almost every conversation. Wherever you would say, ""Thank you"", or when you playfully tease someone, ""You don't know the answer, do you?"", or ""Hey, that's awesome!"" simply touch whatever non-threatening part of them (upper arm, shoulder, back) is least difficult to reach. Don't stretch, don't turn specifically to touch, just make sure you're already in a reasonable position to do so before you start the conversation. This doesn't require significant effort; any position of comfortably talking to someone will allow easy access to a shoulder or their back...don't get too close to the hands, though, as that can feel threatening or too personal for people you've only exchanged a dozen words with; shaking hands is the one exception, but it's become so formalized that it's impersonal.

If you're in an already social environment, you can *start* the conversation with a touch. Simply walk up to someone, put your hand softly but not timidly on their back as though they are an old friend, and start talking. Once the first few words are out, remove your hand and relax (PUA advice always says ""lean away"", but that seems to result in unnatural looking behavior in people I've seen follow it; be natural and relaxed and you'll do the right thing...which isn't necessarily to lean away or to lean in).

This single change in my behavior has increased my social ability more than any piece of advice or routine or line. It is incredibly powerful. The more I use it, the more comfortable I become talking to strangers, and the more positive the results are.

Here's some amazing stuff that's happened in the past year, since I've begun doing this: bus drivers on express buses will stop at unsanctioned stops just because it's raining, staff will comp stuff if there are delays or other problems, staff give discounts that don't actually apply to me without even being asked, and, of course, girls like me better and I find I'm much more frequently able to attract and interest them.

One recent example of this, including the dialog: I paid one cover to get me and the two cute girls I was with into a club just the other night. This looked awesome to the girls, and it was all because I made conversation with the guy, while smiling and in party mode: ""So what's going on tonight? Is it awesome? Really? (touch) Would *you* come see this show if you weren't working? Alright, I think I'm sold, but what's the cover? (touch a slightly different spot)"" I imagine the fact that I was with two cute girls might have had a bearing on the discount, but I went back the next night with another guy and the door guy remembered me and offered me the same deal of one cover for both of us. Even better, the fact that the door guy called inside that the next group was getting in for one cover provided social proof to the absolutely gorgeous girl taking the money. I was able to instantly get a conversation going with her, IOIs were flying and she checked me out every time she walked by that night (again, I was out partying with two super cute and exotic foreign girls, so that totally helps, as well, but it all stacked up to me looking and feeling awesome); I'll be going back to that club.

Since I never can learn anything without examples, I'll provide one more. The express bus driver exchange went like this: As I'm getting on, ""How's it going? Does this bus go by the 7th St. stop?"" ""It does, but I can't stop."" ""OK, but it does stop at 13th, right?"" ""Yes"" ""OK, (I look outside) I guess it's mostly stopped raining, I can walk."" He mumbles a sort of apology. (touch shoulder) ""It's no problem man, a little walking isn't going to hurt me."" About a mile from the stop I wanted he turned to me, and said, ""You wanted 7th right? I'll stop if nobody's watching."" And, I got off right by my house, and touched him on the shoulder as I left, saying, ""Thank you much, sir.""

tldr: touch everybody on the arm or shoulder within seconds of starting any conversation because it makes them (and you) happier and more comfortable instantly.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_bpx0p,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/bpx0p/exercise_touch_everyone_you_talk_to/,
1374365875.0,173,self.seduction,1iq2a7,[FR] #Closed a breathtaking finnish girl from a cold approach on the street.,243,70,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1iq2a7/fr_closed_a_breathtaking_finnish_girl_from_a_cold/,"So let me start off by saying that this is a bit of a follow on from the [field report I posted yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1int5l/fr_first_time_posting_but_semiexperienced_i_want/). I mentioned there I was heading out today to the local park to press on with my 100 set challenge. I'm only 14 sets in, but what happened today was one of those reality shaking ""Eureka!"" moments so I figured it deserved its own field report to share with you and try and analyse what went so right this time. Be warned it's quite detailed, mostly to try and give people ideas on the sorts of things I said and did, I know that I have incorporated things you guys have said into my sets in my own unique way, so hopefully you guys can get some use out of this too.

So, to start off these videos are what inspired the general tone of my approaches today:

[Low Energy Daytime Approach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnOYxQnwOzk)

[A Daygame Approach Using an Assumptive Opener](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHQJezaGWuQ)

[Direct Daygame Makeout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpQFariMc68)

I decided to try two things: The low energy approach and to just go ahead and push everything that little bit further than I otherwise might.

So I get into the centre and it's off to a bad start. The EDL (English Defence League, a right-wing bunch of nutcases fairly well known in the UK) had set up camp to protest near to the city centre, there were police everywhere and everyone was visibly on edge. I'm doing my best to keep spirits high and smile at everyone, but the city centre was dead. People were being advised to stay at home for fear of riots.

Then in the middle of an almost empty high street is a well dressed, gorgeous blonde haired blue eyed young woman taking pictures of everything with a DSLR. She stuck out like a sore thumb against the dreariness of everyone else in town.

I approach from the side,

""So, you're a photographer?""

I smile, lock eyes with her, my body is stood close to her, tall, wide, and still. I stand my ground throughout the interaction.

She smiles and shakes her head.

""So why the fancy camera?""

""I'm just a tourist""

""Oh, an accent! Where are you from?""

""I'm from Finland, actually""

""Really? my mother is from Helsinki""

She lights up and does a cute bounce up and down.

""Really!?""

""Yeah, I'm half Finnish, how long are you in England for?""

""A few weeks""

""I hope you enjoy yourself, this city is my favourite place""

I hold out my hand, she takes it.

""My name is Matt""

""Marri"" she says, with a smile

I hold her hand for just a little longer than normal, enjoying her smile and looking at her very pretty face.

""Lovely to meet you, Marri""

I wink, let go of her hand and walk away.

I continue on, feeling great about the interaction, if not a little regretful about not pushing it even FURTHER. I could feel that there was a lot of potential there that I may have just wasted, things I could've acted on and done. But I'm not that bothered. Remember how before starting PUA you would see that one hot girl on the bus or in the street who stuck out more than everyone else? You would just go about your life never knowing who she was, why she was there. This was one of those moments for me where for the first time in my life, I could say I had approached that woman - the one that stood out from the rest - and it felt amazing in it's own right. Progress, I thought. I was happy.

10 minutes pass, I walk down the high street, through the shopping centre, around slightly and out of the other entrance down a ramp, when I see Marri again, leaning against the ramp, watching the police. This was a sign, fate had given me another shot to follow my own advice and really push things further than normal.

I went right up to her, leaned on the railing next to her, 

""I think you're following me"" I say with a smile.

She looked at me and smiled,

""Matt, hello again,
So why all of the police here? I saw one put a guy in car"" (Her english is adorable)

""Oh, well down broad street that way there is protest by a group called the English Defence League, the police are keeping an eye on things"" I say, while looking her in the eyes again.

She turns, side against the rail to face me. Very positive body language.

""Who are the English Defence League""

I swept her hair aside from her ear, leaned in and whispered

""They're racists""

She giggled, and I flipped myself around so that I was now leaning back against the railing.

""You'll be fine though"" I said while putting my hand against her back briefly

A conversation starts and I asked her all sorts, where she lives, where she works etc, turns out she living in a city nearby and works as an au pair, she's come into my city twice now and this is the second time. I put my arm around her and pull her in to me.

""I'll be your guide""

She stays there. I now have my arm around her and I stay silent for a moment so she can take in what I've just done.

""So Matt, You're half finnish right?...""

She asks me about my family, if I've visited Finland, (I have) and what my job is, asking where I grew up, etc. I'm telling her stories of how I got lost in Helsinki and ended up sleeping on a bench, telling her about my British home town which happens to be right next to where she works. She starts expressing disbelief at the coincidence of it all (all of which are true) and enjoying the fact that randomness has brought us together.
I get my phone out, she glances at it, she knows what I'm doing. I open a contact and fill in her name, and without saying anything, I hand her my phone.

""Sorry I don't give my number to strangers""

""I don't give my phone to strangers. You're not a stranger, so give me your number""

She's still a bit reluctant.

""Besides, I have to dash now, we've been talking for 20 minutes, you know""

She thinks for a moment, fills in her number and gives my phone back.

I held my hand out, she holds mine. This time I put my fingers between hers and play with them.

""Marri, you're a gorgeous woman and meeting you has genuinely made my day""

She smiles a huge grin and tries to hide her face. I give her a hug, kiss her on the cheek.

""Catch you later Marri""  

I walk off.


So, by far the best response I've had so far. And I think what REALLY nailed the entire interaction was body language. The low energy style I adopted really visibly helped her hook fairly early into my first meeting with her. Particularly adopting a position close to her, and then just staying still and comfortable, I could sense much less awkwardness in this interaction than in my last ones, I made an effort to push forward, and escalate kino quickly on the second interaction and I think these two things combined are what really glued the whole thing together.

A little bit later I approached another 4 sets with the same style, I didn't #close any more today but in general I could feel the low energy vibes paying off a whole lot. Needless to say I really like this style, I think I'll be trying it out a little bit more and playing around with more cold street approaches.

1370004327.0,172,self.seduction,1fefjb,How To Score A Threesome,302,130,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fefjb/how_to_score_a_threesome/,"I’ve had my fair share of girl-girl-guy threesomes. I’ve had the guy-guy-girl too but that’s not nearly as much fun. This article will explain the two best ways to get a girl-girl-guy threesome. I’ve only managed to get threesomes in 2 very distinct ways. In order to be successful at both methods you need to have a high level of experience. This is not something that will happen overnight but, if you work it correctly you’ll be shocked at the results.


**Number 1 – Introducing the girls to each other:**


This is a simple process but it’s fairly difficult to pull off.


***Step 1*** – You first need to think about 2 women you’d like to do this with. It’s vital that you’ve slept with both of them, it gets a lot more difficult if one of them hasn’t seen you naked. Ideally, you should have slept with both for quite some time, enough time to make them very comfortable around you. You don’t want your frigid ex, you want 2 girls that are open-minded, liberal and who are also bi-curios or sexually adventurous.


***Step 2*** – When you’re alone with them, bring up the topic of bisexuality, a good time to do this would be in bed before or after sex. If she seems keen on the idea bring up the topic as a “thought experiment”. Make it seem very positive and if she seems somewhat into it, try talking about it during sex (part of your dirty talk). What I’ve noticed over the years is that many women have some sort of bisexuality towards other women however; most of them aren’t up for the task. Some of the women I’ve been with are open to the idea but are not comfortable with it. If that’s the same in your case, your number one priority would be to make her comfortable with the idea.


***Step 3*** – Ok, so by now, you should have both women comfortable with the idea. Let a few weeks slide and bring it up again mentioning, “You know, I know this really hot girl…She’s bi (or just into it) and I’m sure she’d wanna do something like that”. They don’t mind if you slept with the other one, actually in some cases it helped (it was somewhat like an acknowledgement). If both girls seem into it, giving it a try wouldn’t take much effort.


***Step 4*** – Plan a meeting. Tell both the exact same things (that you might be meeting the other one tonight and ask if she minds to meet her as well). Don’t make plans or anything as that will only freak them out.


***Step 5*** – Set up a meeting, you don’t need me to tell you how to pick a place and all that… Make it all seem spontaneous, I know you mentioned it to them…but just make it feel like that.


***Step 6*** – As soon as you get there you’ll know instantly if it’s on or not. The girls will decide this on the spot. If it’s working, you can tell by the way they talk, act nervous slightly tense etc. If it’s not, YES you’ve lost weeks of planning…but it was just a shot…always remember that you were having sex with 2 women for the past months and, you just tried to DO them together. Trust me; I had things blown up in my face countless times.


***Step 7*** – Get some alcohol flowing, the more the better.


***Step 8*** – Ideally you want to take them to your place, be careful with the invitation as not to freak one out…they should both be comfortable with your house…so just try to get them there.


***Step 9*** – At the house, start making out with one, then move onto the other, then get them involved. If this is happening and everyone is at your house, you’re pretty much set.


It’s worth mentioning that some of them (well quite a few of them) do freak out at this point. If that hasn’t’ happened, its definitely on!



**Number 2 – Using your BI girlfriend:**


Ok so a few years ago I had this bisexual girlfriend. She was hot and even better she was HOT for girls. Now even though she’s bisexual, it doesn’t mean she was bringing girls home for me to have sex with, being bisexual just means that she has sex with girls – she can have either a girlfriend or a boyfriend. When she was with me, it was my job to make her want other girls and to make her be ok about bringing other girls in bed with us.


In any case, if you ever manage to secure a bisexual girlfriend here’s how you play the game.


To get things straight here, I know you’re a guy and have game, but when it comes to picking up the other girl, your BI girlfriend should be doing all the work. She will own it much better than you and here’s why:


***She very rarely get’s rejected, if ever…***


***She can identify bi-curios girls instantly.*** 


A big mistake I was always making was to work girls for 30 mins only to discover that they weren’t into other girls. Let your girl open it, she’s going to be good at spotting this.


The only exception here is with groups. Hardly any girl acts like we do – open up a group of girls and picks one etc. That’s when you come in, get a girl, isolate her from the group and then get your BI girlfriend to step in.


Most girlfriends love doing things together, this includes “picking-up together” but when you tell them, “ok go open up that group and pick that blonde over there”, they just get nervous and want to stay the night with you.


Anyway the reason you still want her to open is because she knows instantly if the other girl is up for it. Regardless of how good your game is, when you ask a girl for a threesome she will always question your motives. She’s just less likely to believe you. A few times I still managed to get the 2nd girl all by myself (at least 1 hour of work, compared to 10 mins by my girlfriend) and in this scenario, apart from my gf being upset that she’s been sitting alone for the last hour, she would also think that the other one just wanted to have sex with me and, not with US.


***Always remember, threesomes are all about the girls. You’re just along for the ride.***


So she does the pick-up, she brings her to you and, you start to flirt and generally get to know each other. By this time YOUR Bi-girlfriend should make the proposition of coming home with you. Now…it’s here where most of them realize that this is actually for real and freak out. In my experience about half of them do that, they either leave straight up or are flattered but can’t actually do it.


If you’re lucky and she agrees, it’s up to you to sort everything.  Get them drinks, keep them feeling good and entertained, flirt with both, be sexual with both etc.


This is when they start to gang up on you. They all do it, all the time. They tease you; make fun of you etc…let it happen. I usually just sit there thinking to myself “Blabla in about an hour I’m going to have sex with both of you haha!” All they said and teased didn’t really matter. I do have to admit, it might feel uncomfortable sometimes but deal with it, you’re a man right?


Either you or your girlfriend can initiate the kiss. Initially I always let my gf to do it but as we did it more I tried it myself and it worked just as good.


***Now it’s time to take them home,*** like always once home let them get comfortable, more drinks, some music and let loose. They can still freak out at this point but, most of them, if they got this far, will let it happen.


**Final note** – make sure you and your girlfriend clarify things. Make sure you let her go down on the other girl or the other way around. Also clarify that you can do your business with the other girl. I know some guys who had threesomes and only had sex with their girlfriends…what’s the point of that? Whatever you do make sure you get some action!

1365352412.0,176,self.seduction,1bux1t,Fun field-tested opener from last night (and more),284,108,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1bux1t/fun_fieldtested_opener_from_last_night_and_more/,"Hey guys. I'm back from a fun weekend with the /r/GothamSeddit crew in NYC.

I was opening girls left &amp; right with an opener that I found so hilarious and effective that it would be rude of me not to share. I call it...

**The ""Don't Fucking Touch Me""**

It all started when I was walking through a bar with a friend of mine who approaches a very attractive girl. As he went to approach her in a hallway she snapped immediately and said *""Don't fucking touch me!""*

Of course we cracked up and this turned into a meme for the rest of the night.

Anyway, try this out sometime... Walk up and offer a girl a high-five. As soon as she touches your hand, feign anger and say ""Don't fucking touch me."" Hold it... wait for it... wait for it... Now give her the troll face (the one that says ""LOL I'm just kidding, you silly girl."")

This is one of those non-sequitor reality destroyers that I love so much. It's hilarious and hooks 8/10 sets. 2/10 sets will get pissed off but those are the boring girls you want to stay away from anyway.

Try it out sometime, see what happens. (As always, calibration is key. If you're nervously shaking and can't make it clear that you are just fucking around this will backfire horribly, so be careful).

**Why this opener works:** Because you are doing something unexpected and unique. She is likely not used to guys hitting on her in this fashion. You are demonstrating a sense of humor and confidence that she is bound to find refeshing compared to the vast majority of pickup attempts she fends off. It also helps short circuit her normal shields and gives you a longer window to absorb her into your reality.

---

**The ""He's hung like a horse""**

Here's another hilarious routine from last night. We are waiting for a friend of ours to arrive and we're chatting up two girls at the bar. Somehow the topic of his height comes up, so my friend describes him to the girl as ""about her height."" She says, ""So he's 5'3""?"" I jump in and say, ""Yeah but he's hung like a horse.""

I then wait for their reaction (shock mostly). Then I keep frame and push it farther (agree &amp; amplify). *""Seriously, it's totally disproportionate for his frame. It's fucking bizarre.""*

This leads to a string of questions and a whole conversation about how guys talk about sex versus women. Example:

&gt; HB: So you just sit around and look at each others' dicks?

&gt; Me: Nah, we tag-teamed a girl together so I got to know it quite intimately.

This sets up a very sexual frame and establishes that we are guys who like to have kinky sex.

Needless to say, the girls were all over him when he arrived.

---

The moral of the story is: don't be afraid to be self-entertained and have fun. Pickup should be hilarious to you. Go out seeking lulz and good things will happen.

This shit is supposed to be fun. Don't take yourself too seriously.

Started reading seddit and it completely changed me. Introduced my buddy to it and we had the best summer of our lives. I had three dates, which I realize isn't a record, but it's three more than the previous three years.

Around Nov. 2011 I met a girl that I was instantly head-over-heals for. We've been dating for six months.

Here's why I post this: over the weekend we were hanging out with some friends including my buddy (who's gotten so good, he picked up two girls in that bar and was sitting with them in our group when the following happened). Someone asked my girlfriend why she was initially attracted to me. Her very first response was, ""he was real. He wasn't running a game.""

I flashed a knowing glance at my buddy and we both worked hard to suppress laughter. The night I met her, he had seen me do it, from using an opener word-for-word from a video posted here, to the kino, to my response when I tried (but failed) to take her home that nght. It was all game that I learned here.

So anyway, I asked her what that meant, that I hadn't used game on her. She said the following three things:

- I hadn't boasted.

- I hadn't lied.

- I wasn't boring*

So the moral of the story is, either that's what women think game is about, or else guys are doing it wrong.

*when she says ""boring"" I think she's talking about a guy putting her on a pedestal. I don't do ""negging"" but I do keep her grounded. One thing she said to me that night we met was something along the lines of her being the most beautiful girl I'd ever meet.

1363590210.0,171,self.seduction,1aigy6,"The Goose &amp; the Golden Egg (Self-improvement, re-posted here from GothamSeddit because a mod requested so)",212,41,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1aigy6/the_goose_the_golden_egg_selfimprovement_reposted/,"Sup guys!  This thought has been brewing in my mind for a while, and I'm forcing myself to write a short article on it to help me crystallize it.  And if you've read the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, this will be a regurgitation of a portion of that book.  Apologies if this is completely useless to you, but it's helped my game, and my life overall, quite a bit. 

**The Goose and the golden egg:**

There was a very poor farmer who had a goose.  One day, he found that the goose had laid a golden egg.  He went to the store, sold the egg, and received a good amount of money from it.  The next day, he had found that the goose laid another golden egg.  Again, he went to the store and sold the egg.

After a few days, he realizes that he wants more than one golden egg a day - he wants a dozen, all at once.  So he goes and slices open his goose - but lo and behold, there were no eggs inside.  And now he had no way of getting any more precious golden eggs. 


**Moral of the story:**

Usually this story is told with the moral that there is no end to greed - the greedy only get greedier.  But it's not that simple.  This simple story tells an amazing principle in where to invest your energies. 

* What the farmer wanted: Golden Eggs.  
* What produced the golden eggs: The Goose. 

The farmer was blind to what actually PRODUCED the golden eggs.  Ignorantly, he tried to take a shortcut, and just went for the eggs.  That was his true folly.  Had he cared for the goose, nurtured it, made sure it was healthy, then he would still be enjoying those eggs.


**Investing in yourself:**

In pickup, what is your **golden egg** ?  What is the prize?  If you're like me, it's usually something like this: **being popular with and fucking beautiful women** .  Great.  Then what is the **goose** ?

Well, **it's YOU**.  But not just any version of you: it's an **ATTRACTIVE you**.  It's the version of you that both women and men love being around, partying with, speaking with.  So are you investing in yourself?

Lots of guys are focused on just the end goal of having sex with women.  While that is fine and actually helpful, a lot of them *don't invest in making themselves more AWESOME* .  That would be tantamount to a farmer that only thinks about going to the store to sell the eggs, but not tending to his goose.  Meanwhile, his goose is getting sicker and hungrier by the day...

If you look at any truly **attractive man** , it should be very obvious that **he invests in himself** .  He will work hard at his career because he takes pride in what he does.  He will educate himself, he will take time out of his schedule to exercise.  He will travel.  He will study pickup as well, as that is also a form of investing in himself.  He will take care of his mind, body and soul.  To him, he comes first.  Not in a selfish manner, but in a manner of prioritization of his time and energy.  If he made plans to hit the gym at 6pm, and some girl texts him to grab a drink at 6pm, he will say ""Hey, let's do it at 7 instead.""  **He won't cave in to the whims of women at the sacrifice of his own goals**. 

**How this will affect you**:

Investing in yourself does wonders for inner game.  You actually become **higher value IN YOUR OWN eyes** .  You start to see that you ARE a man of high value.  You start adopting a sense of **entitlement** .  You have an abundance-mentality, because, of COURSE women will want to date you.  You are not needy.  And all of this confidence becomes apparent in all the subtle contexts of your speech, dress, and body language.  It becomes a spiral of positivity. 


Of course, in pickup, you often have the other extreme.  The guys who study, exercise, read tons of pickup literature...but never approach or actually pick up.  That would be like having a healthy, well-producing goose, but doing NOTHING with the golden eggs - they just stay there.  It's the **eternal student syndrome** .  You have to balance between goose-activities, and golden-egg-activities. 

To be truly successful at pickup, one must:

1. INVEST IN HIMSELF, and 
2. TAKE ACTION. 


So go on!  Start building the life that you deserve to have.  Build yourself to be the man that you want to be.  And go out and let your awesome, sexy self be known to all the lucky women waiting to meet you.

1361818314.0,174,self.seduction,197f45,My life philosophies on becoming a better man,213,39,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/197f45/my_life_philosophies_on_becoming_a_better_man/,"Hi Seddit...last year while trying to turn my life around, I wrote a set of guidelines in order to be a successful happy man in life. I want to share it with you guys and also want to hear any opinions on whether there should be additional ""rules"" I should strive for:

*“The habits you form here will be with you for the rest of your life.”*

**I focus on two approaches: personal growth (social skills, relationships, appearance, etc.) and intellectual growth (career, degrees, learning, etc.):**

* Carpe diem, YOLO, etc. – I know this is cliché, but you have one life; make the best out of it every single day. When you are on your deathbed, the ONE question you want to answer yes to is “Did I live a fulfilling life with no regrets?” Be impulsive and spontaneous in life. Do not lead a boring life.

* Travel when you are young! – Living in one place boxes a person in. Become open-minded and roam around the world when you have time; see and absorb different cultures; learn from other people. The best learning comes from experiences.  

* DGAF – Don’t give a fuck what everyone thinks of you or want you to become. It is your life that you are living; you are not living for anyone else, not your parents, not your boss, not your friends. LIVE HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE AND DGAF ALL DAY EVERYDAY. 

* Do not quit learning – Learn something new everyday either from other people, experiences, or from reading. Go out and obtain an advanced degree; never quit learning.

* A healthy body leads to a healthy mind – Exercise often (at least 3 times a week); strive to have the body you are proud of (check out r/fitness).

* Eat healthy – 70% of obtaining the body/shape you want is diet!

* Contrary to popular belief in the seduction community, your appearance matters– Strive to dress nice (check out r/malefashionadvice) and maintain a good hygiene. Maintain both a clean self and a clean environment of which you are a part of (i.e., your office, your apartment, car, etc.)

* Laziness is your worst enemy – Do not feel like going out because you are tired? Excuses, don’t be lazy; just do it. Procrastinating all day on Facebook and not getting work done? Get off and do something productive. Having good time management skills is crucial in life. Oh just a reminder, as Ja Rule puts it, be always on time.

* Money is not everything – Money doesn’t go with you when you leave this Earth. Do not put money and monetary status on a pedestal. Having a steady income is important but do not worry too much about being rich; life is too short for that. Rather, put more emphasis on becoming a better person.

* Lastly, evaluate the relationships in your life – As the saying goes, “you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.” If you hanging out with chodes, then I’m sorry you are a chode. If your friends are holding you back or using you, time to ditch them . Be a value-giver and find friends who are also value-givers.

Pardon me if I suck at posting, I'm still a noob at Reddit, but I am here to share my techniques which I have fool-proofed and field tested and know they work, so I'm here to share it with you guys! Try it out for yourselves! There are some basic Principals of game you should already have knowledge of before getting into this, although you will/can also learn it on the way.These principles mainly rely on Attraction which is primarily based on Push &amp; Pull and Body Language. There are plenty of resources out there that teach you how to attract women and the type of lifestyle, so I won't get into that. I'm here mainly to teach you a Step by Step guide on how to Daygame effectively and efficiently. Any man can apply this at any level of their game, but obviously the more experience you have the easier this is going to be.

Here we go. How to daygame.

Rules (as silly as they seem, first and foremost, this is the mindset you should have when going into it): 
1) Keep cool - Simply means to keep your cool and not overplay it. Think about how a master womanizer would behave when talking to women. If you are not that womanizer, pretend. When you keep your cool you seem to learn more and step outside yourself. Which brings me to another point, stepping outside yourself. When you go out to daygame, always step outside your self and observe yourself as third person POV. This is how you learn your mistakes

2) Have Fun - Basically means don't give a fuck. You are probably never going to see that woman again if you do get shut down, WHICH BTW YOU WILL. Not everyone is super nice, well in Canada yeah...but NOT everyone is nice. So just have fun when you go out. Be bold, be brave, be briliant! Try out new things you never have, because when you do, that is when you realize what works and what doesn't. Don't take it all too seriously, at the end of the day, if you don't pick up a chick, you just fucking tested out some new shit you've been wanting to try, that in its self is a HUGE success. Take it easy champ.


The main goal of daygame should not be just to pick up a chick, but to sweep her off her feet. 
""No woman wakes up in the morning wishing not to be swept off her feet"" - Hitch
So how do you do that you ask? Well, I'm glad you asked.

There are 3 phases to daygame:
1) Initiation/Introduction ""Opening""
2) Rapport building
3) Closing

These 3 phases altogether can take anywhere from 2 minutes to 30 minutes to Instadate! and FFS if you get an Instadate take that oppurtunity, your greatest teachers are women. Learn from them!

Let's cut right to the good stuff! ATTENTION! EVERY PIECE OF THIS IS VITAL TO SUCCESS! YOU CANNOT SKIP ANY PORTION! I know it's very thorough, but bare with me.

Phase 1 - Initiation:
Step 1 - SMILE &amp; GREET 
This is probably the most important thing, TO SMILE! You obviously wanna be making Eye contact with her. Eye contact with a genuine smile can go far ways. So how are you going to get in the set?! ANYHOW YOU CAN! It usually takes me second to realize how beautiful a woman is, resulting in me having to run back and chase her down, after I walk past her and made initial eye contact. You can do it however you want, regardless if she is sitting, standing or walking, just make sure when you go up to her you are smiling and you have a warm greet! A simple ""Hi"" will do just fine.  Quick tip, don't approach girls who are running. BAD idea.

PAUSE (make sure you hold your gaze and smile after you've said hello, pause for a few seconds then carry on) 

Step 2 - JUSTIFICATION/PRE-FRAME
At this step you are expressing your intention. It's very important how you do this, if you do it the wrong way you will creep her out or come off as too strong or maybe too weak. Practice! Delivery is very important! The method to doing goes something like this, e.g. ""I know this is a little bit unusual..."" or ""I know this is a little strange..."" THAT right there is your pre-frame, what this does from her Point of view is it sets her up slowly for what's coming, so she is prepared to be swept off her feet, she will recognize that what you are about to say is probably going to make her day! So take your time with this and make it as sweet as possible, and make sure to hold your gaze.

Another brief Pause here, hence the ""..."" after your Pre-frame line. (this has fucked me up countless amount of times, because if you don't pause here, the tension does not live up to the moment that you've created thus far) Slow it down, remember you want to create that movie moment for her.

Step 3 - REASON FOR APPROACH
Your reason is your intention and your initial thought about her, what caught your interest about her, make it genuinely about her, something you found interesting, be it her vibe, apparel, looks, smile, eyes, hair, shoes, whatever. MAKE IT GENUINE. e.g. ""You have an absolutely beautiful smile that caught my attention, and I had to come meet you"" or ""You seemed kinda interesting, I noticed your pink pants and thought that was really cool, so I had to come meet you"". These are the moments that make it or break it, you stutter, your fucked, but don't worry it comes with practice. 

PAUSE (This is your final pause in the initiation phase and it really builds attraction like no other, you were bold enough to tell her exactly what's on your mind in a detailed way that says, yes woman I'm attracted to you. Woman love that; compliments along with confidence, and this precise technique can take you a far ways)


Phase 2 - Rapport Building:
(This phase is very modifiable to your personality and who you are, so make it personable. It also has less of a structure here and more of a basis to go by, so you can freestyle, just keep your foot out of your mouth ;P)

Step 1:
""I'm [Insert name here] btw."" Stick your hand out, and now let her introduce herself. What I like to do after we shake hands is slowly bring her hand down while I continue the conversation just to build some more tension, and let go slowsly, so you are actually holding her hand for an extra few seconds. One of my favorite moves, can be applied to any introduction anywhere and shows that you have interest in that woman.

Step 2:
From this point I get into background basics like: Where are you from, where is your accent from, are you from around her/out of town?, how are you liking this city, I guess her occupation, etc. Conversation should be flowing at this point, your goal at rapport building is to find common interests and talk about those things. Keep in mind, this is NOT an interview, so make sure you tease her every once in a while, and you don't just ask question after question, comment on it, listen to what she has to say, and have something to say back.

Basic pointers for rapport: connect on commonalities, Push&amp;pull meaning tease her, talk about music, talk about the night scene. WHATEVER YOUR INTERESTS ARE, CATER YOUR GAME TO IT. This way she is qualifying to you, but you are still taking interest in her. Make sure she has the oppurtunity to tell you about herself, and at that point shut the fuck up and listen. Be curious about her.

Step 3:
The 3 things you want to get out of her from rapport building is (1) Emotions (2) Motivations (3) Character traits. What this does is it makes her invest in you, so it feels like she's known you for a long time, since you now know something very important and relevant in her life.

Games are fun, if you know any play them. If not, Role play works great. If you don't know Role play, you should definitely read some more books on Pick up and general Game.


Once you know about her interests, leave on a high note. It's time to wrap it up, suggest a date based on her interests and sell it to her! Make it sound like it's gonna be so much fun!! 


Phase 3 - Close:

Now that you are getting along so well with her, suggest the date and when she says yeah that sounds great. WHip out your phone and say something along the lines of, ""Awesome, let's exchange numbers"" and HAND her your phone as you say it, whatever you say. BUT don't make it a question. Make it a statement. She will respond much better to a statement.

So when you hand her your phone and she puts in those digits, and while you may or may not be doing the same, continue the conversation, don't just stand there silently.
Tell her that you need a nickname for her, and now that you know so much about her, a fun nickname should be easy to grasp, if you can't think of one on the spot, make it up based on her attributes eg. freckles, long legs, highheels, pink pants. etc. BUT if you're gonna do this, add a compliment at the end, like ""I'm gonna name you, Freckles girl with cute smile :)"". It's better if you have a nickname catered to her personality, it makes her much more memorable in your head, and vice versa.
So after you nickname her and you both have a good laugh about it, save her number, and if you can, continue the conversation for a little bit longer before taking off.
Make sure to leave on a positive note! So the last thing that comes out of your mouth should be positive. Eg. ""It was great meeting you, I'll see you later, Adventure girl!""

THAT'S A WRAP TO SUCCESSFUL PICK UP IN THE DAYTIME, ANYWHERE!

There are many contingencies I could get into, but then I would just bore everyone out of their minds, so I kept it to the basic principles that I know and learned myself. This method works 100%..just work out the kinks and find your failing factors. Chances are you're most likely gonna fuck up on a few things that first dozen times, but if you keep it at, I promise you your success rates is gonna shoot through the roof. Make it your goal to pick up a 100 woman this week, so do up the 100 sets challenge and try this out, I know I'm going to!

Now text game is a whole another game to play...just get those digits, and practice practice practice!

Any questions, shoot at me.

I managed to get into contact with someone with a fair deal of experience under their belt, and went out into the city this weekend.

I started my morning by waking with something like 5 hours sleep and a shitty hangover. Serves me right for drinking so much the night before  :lol: I was not in the greatest mood, somewhat anticipating this would lead me even more toward failure, but I pushed those thoughts away the best I could.

It was a very interesting day, ending in something around perhaps 30 - 40 approaches over the day, and two number closes, for the two I times I actually attempted. Probably my first approaches and daytime number closes ever!

I was fairly nervous inside, but having someone there with me was a huge boost in pushing myself to just go and approach, I'm sure if I just turned up on my own, there is no way I would have been able to get the ball rolling without a ton of excuses and hesitation generating in my mind. I'll need to work on this over time so that I can have more independence in this.

It was great having someone that could watch me and give me some tips afterwards. At first I had to just approach indirect, be it a canned opener or just winging it. First few were blowouts, I could tell by the reaction that I was telegraphing how nervous I was, I could feel how much I was. Actually the first, funnily enough - Was a 9 or 10, modelling lingerie.. this was the first opportunity that came up,  :lol:  not the easiest.

After that was a girl shopping by herself (or so I thought). Did the whole cliche *picks up female clothing item, What do you think?*, steered it off into a story about needing to get a present for a girl etc blah blah. The whole group of girls she is with come back, I end up holding the conversation for 5 - 10 mins with this 4 set, get some laughter going on, and end up exiting myself.

There were many many more approaches, a couple where the girl was by herself, then the boyfriend came back and I had to sort of bring him into the conversation, it worked far better than I thought it would, and I had the couple laughing. Something interesting I noted during one of these particular interactions was that I noticed my eye contact going a bit off and when I remembered to make a conscious effort, I sort of felt like I was staring, or rather like I was ""diving"" in the girl's eyes (really not sure how else to explain it  :lol: ) and suddenly she was smiling 3x as much and doing the same back to me.

I was generally nervous throughout most of this, but after some successful approaches this started to go away a little bit. 

One approach that sticks with me is a girl that I found very attractive/an 8 to me. She was laughing a lot, and I was finally able to consciously change things I was doing wrong in the interaction as it was going, which I couldn't do before (I guess being REALLY nervous blocks this out a bit?). She was following my lead, I was able to naturally transition my body language and lean back on a railing (yeah right so smooth  8-)  :lol: ) and she followed this movement / was in my frame. I was remembering to keep eye contact, keep my hands out of my pockets, stand up straight / dominant stance (this is a particular sticking point for me, as my posture is not good, physically rounded forward shoulders etc). I didn't know how to move this one forward, so ended up exiting myself after 5 - 10 minutes. Now I look back on the IOIs (still not doing so good at noticing these/acting on them during the interaction, I wish I'd pushed further, but oh well.

Something I've noticed for myself personally, I find that if the girl is really attractive to me, say 7 or higher, I'm more nervous in general, but if she is receptive, I can continue the conversation easier due to the stronger physical attraction I'm feeling? Not sure 100% sure though, I'll have to suss this out.

Now for direct approach  :shock: 

So the guy I was with decided to do a deal. He would direct approach a girl, and number close. I would have to attempt to do some regardless of the outcome, but if she turned him down, I'd have to do 10. I dived right in and shook hands on the deal, albeit with some underlying hesitation  :? 

I watched his direct approach. Body language was absolutely flawless, and yep, he got the number close, and it was great to see how ridiculously happy and giddy the girl was, and how she kept looking around for him afterwards.

I observed a lot of behavior, things like general banter to people working behind the counter etc when purchasing. This sort of thing is where I aim to be. Where I am very confident and comfortable with just saying what I want and striking up conversations with people in everyday life, throwing in a joke or two etc. I know how much better it can make my mundane working day if someone is like that to me, so it would make me feel good to be able to do the same thing for someone else/be the initiator.

So I practiced a few direct approaches on the guy I was with, which was pretty funny in itself. Man...  proper body language is hard for me to remember and consistently implement  :lol: 

Putting my hands into my pockets, or hooking them on my pockets, standing slightly too close, going for a kino touch on the outside of the arm, and looking at where I'm touching  :lol: Standing up straight/shoulders back, chest out. Also speaking LOUDER.

Direct approach was much much much harder. My approach anxiety was much higher now. I ended up approaching a 9 that was buying food. Super nervous, ended up pussing out and saying something like ""I like your shoes"" and making a joke... her face lit up and she smiled heavily, but I went blank and just sorta did a ""yeah that's all"" and exited.  :? 

Guy I was with pointed out that she kept looking around for me afterwards, not sure how much this can really mean or not.

Anyway, I tried to do a few more direct approaches indoors/in shops, every time I ended up going indirect, it was so hard. I requested to go out to the street (I feel more comfortable doing this sorta stuff outside rather that indoors, perhaps something to do with more going on in the environment around me.)

Did another indirect, it was going pretty well. Lots of joking etc back and forth. The girl seemed kinda shy but opened up more as the interaction went on. It finally clicked in my head when I'd hit a certain point in the interaction to just *GO FOR THE NUMBER CLOSE, JUST DO IT GO GO GO*. So I took my phone out, did a typical sorta ""You know what... after all this, you're actually kinda cool"" number close, got the number.

I finally built myself up to do the direct a couple of times. Had some flakes where the girl just gave me a ""deer in the headlights"" sorta look, others just did a somewhat condescending ""Ohhh okay, hello"", another not so condescending, but more in a confused sort of way... Eventually I succeeded at doing a direct approach to a girl that was texting someone when I approached. It was certainly a weird experience. Number closed.

I honestly exceeded my expectations and left very happy. I don't necessarily expect the number closes to lead to anything, and I'm cool with that, I'm just so glad I managed to -

Approach
Keep conversations going 
Get sets laughing / getting into the interaction
Number close
Finally do a direct opener with a minimal amount of errors

So it was a day full of both blowouts, but also some success. A very interesting learning experience. I would say that I don't have an emotional attachment to the outcome, or very little attachment to the outcome. I didn't really get any ""Oh what does she think of me, she's better than me, maybe she doesn't like my clothes etc etc"", but for me it's more me having thoughts about what I am doing wrong in my interactions, specifically - telegraphing nervousness. No matter how much I try to calm myself, it is VERY difficult to not telegraph nervousness, especially if the girl is not receptive. If she is, it does tend to go away. Also very hard to make a conscious effort to react to IOIs as well as fix things I'm doing wrong with my body language. I guess this comes down to practice, but I would say that it really helps having someone watching that can tell you what habits you keep coming back to. I don't always realise during the interaction.

I have been a nighttime/club sorta guy for years. Not picking up or even trying, but just someone with that particular social circle. It was great to actually get out during the day for once.. to get some sunlight even!  :lol: 

So that was my first attempt at day game. Initial stepping stones in this journey.

TL:DR - Went out with someone experienced that mentored me in day game. Ended up doing ~30 - 40 approaches. Tried number closing twice and succeeded. Did some direct approaches.

Going to the grocery store to pick up some food, there’s a twinge of anxiety – “am I walking weird right now?”

It’s normal.

While you’re thinking, “am I walking weird right now,” the person you think is judging you is **thinking the exact same thing.

Both of your mental cameras are turned inward, paying attention only to yourselves and no one else.

The people around you are invisible.

Now to the bar.

“I’m not talking to anyone, people think I’m a loser.” We become hyper-sensitive to everything we’re doing. Every step we make, every motion, every facial expression. Playing Sherlock Holmes with our external appearances. 

It's normal. But **everyone around you is doing the exact same thing.**

The environment where you feel the most exposed—the bar—is the environment where **you’re the least exposed.** Everyone is so focused on themselves they don’t have time to focus on you.

When was the last time you focused on what a dude was doing at a bar? The only time is when you compare yourself to a group of guys and think, “I may not be talking to anyone but at least I don’t have my arms crossed.” And then you forget about them.

Remember that time you felt like a complete piece of shit at the bar?

Reddit has sucked countless hours of my precious free time but the things I have learned here have drastically changed my life. I have gone from depressed/no friends/never been kissed @ 22/forever alone/no confidence type to almost the exact opposite. Seddit has done wonders for my life, and for that I thank you all! 

I have lost 40 lbs thanks to /fitness and /loseit.

I went from not understanding how to start any kind of relationship more than a friendship to having women chase me. 

I lost my virginity thanks to seddit! (atleast help me achieve it quicker).

In about 10 months, I have transformed my life. I have just started this journey, and i have alot to learn. Although none of these are new to this subreddit, repetition never hurt.

1. Achieving goals - take baby steps and you won't believe how easy it can be. (Set daily/weekly/monthly goals)
2. Friends - always be around better people than yourself. It will help push you to become a better person. Always be making new friends, you never know. 
3. Improving yourself - Never stop improving yourself (mentally and physically). Keep learning new things and always try new experiences.
4. Comfort - if something makes you feel uncomfortable you SHOULD probably do it. Applies to all aspects of life.
5. Live for yourself - pretty much being outcome independent. Don't do things for other people, just do what makes you happy today. 
6. Smile - And say hello. You just started a conversation. (do it with EVERYONE.)
7. Outcomes - If you are thinking about doing or saying something, stop thinking and do it. It puts you out of frame and in a funk.
8. Hobbies - Find things to keep you busy and allow you to meet new people. Anything will work! Gives you conversation topics and a way to make friends.
9. Stress - It has never done you any good. Learn to live day by day and roll with the punches.
10. Gossip - Avoid it, and don't talk badly about others. As your mother said. If you don't have something nice to say don't say anything at all. 

Nothing ground breaking but a few tips I'd give to those just starting the journey. 

11. Get off the couch and start living!!

EDIT: Apprecaite all the comments and upvotes. 

Travel: For all of those lucky enough to do so, I highly recommend. Even if you can, go on a weekend camping trips nearby. Expeience is the best conversation ammo. 

For all the University Sedditors: Join groups/clubs. Play intermurals. Don't always go after the girls. Finding another high value friend can be very beneficial. People always know other people.

- Getting Upset - keeping you're cool is one of the most important DHV. If a girl flakes, don't call her a bitch or get angry. Also don't get sucked into being the nice guy.

I am planning on recording a video to try to answer as much questions as I can verbally/visually, and hopefully it will be up tomorrow. I'm going to include basic dance tutorial specifically to the explanation below, and how to basic shuffle, and how to sponge bob :D

Hey guys. I've been seeing some comments about people not having that confidence to dance, because they simply don't really know how to dance, or feel like they look awkward when dancing. I'm a dancer of 10 years, and I would like to help out those that want to start dancing with these beginner tips. Note, I said true beginners on the title. If you already have some basic fundamentals of dancing, this post really won't help you in improving, but please do share your thoughts also.

Little about me first: I discovered that I could dance when I was 16. I entered a talent show and performed the choreography dance from Michael Jackson - Smooth Criminal with few of my friends. The responses were amazing, asking me where I learned how to dance, how long I've been doing it, etc. When I found out this maybe a talent I have discovered, I continued to build on it, and I still do today. I am not a professional dancer, but an avid dancer. I've tried out for So You Think You Can Dance Season 2, and I have friends in dancing crews of Swagger Crew and Jungle Boogie from Season 5 America's Best Dance Crew.

So, you have no idea where to start in dancing. Here are the steps I want you to take, in these order, and I think this will definitely help you understand the fundamentals of dancing.

Step 1: Listen to the songs carefully. Identify the tempo, different rhythm patterns, beat, analyze it. The simplest is the tempo, so practice with this first. It's almost always consistent throughout songs. Feel the tempo; count to it if you have to (1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.). Once you got the tempo, go to step 2.

Step 2: Now you have the tempo in your head, and you're counting in your head. Lets slowly translate that to physical movements. It can be anything subtle: head bobbing, clapping, snapping fingers, fist pump, moving side to side, anything. Just practice moving with the tempo. While you're counting 1, 2, 3, 4, during the COUNT you should be doing a repetitive movement. Once you got this down, step 3.

Step 3: Bigger movements, and/or multiple movements. Still, you're with the tempo, synced with the counts. If you're head bobbing, try bending your knees too with the head bob, or maybe if you're fist pumping add a side-to-side movement. Stay with the count. After this, you can move to step 4.

Step 4: Mix your movements. You don't want to be head bobbing throughout the whole song, you gotta mix it up so you don't look boring. Head bob for maybe 8 counts, then add some fist pumping, then side to side, then maybe knee bending, whatever you want to do. Mix it up ever so often. Always remember to stay with the count. If you want to kick it up a bit, try movements that takes 1 more than 1 count to complete, like 2 counts to complete 1 movement.

Practice these 4 steps repeatedly, until it becomes a no-brainer on detecting a tempo and then just moving with it. Don't worry about ""how you look"" right now. Being in-sync is much more important than looking fluid, but completely not in-sync with whatever song's playing.

After you understand how to move with whatever song's playing, then you can start adding ""animations"" to your movements, whether it's fluid movments, or stiff movements, or combination.

Muscle control is involved in any type of ""animated movements."" It's not hard, but you do have to wire your brain to understand. Fluid movements are created by having loose/relaxed muscles, and not creating any harsh/stuttery/rigid movements. Movements should be smooth in transition, and especially visible in transition from 1 type of movement to another. Body waves are the most common in creating this. There are many youtube videos on how to do body waves, so I'd suggest hitting up on some of these.

To create much more animated look, during all the fluid/smooth movements, adding some stiff/harsh movements for a little bit can really enhance the look of your dancing. This means locking your muscles pretty much, or a complete freeze. Lets say you're doing a simple side-to-side step, and you're adding like a sway. At the end of each sway, you can pause for a count. This creates an enhancement to your movements as you went from fluid to freeze. 

All in all, practice all this, and you will eventually be able to do something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zumqR5WW6aA
This is me freestyling to T-Pain - Take Your Shirt Off. As you can see, I try not to repeat a lot of my movements (I may end up using the same stuff at some point), fluid smooth transitions from 1 movement to another, sometimes adding a ""lock"" to really enhance the visual animation. Sometimes I'll go really rough with my movements (testosterone overload!!!), but it still looks great because I'm synced with the rhythm/tempo/beat of the song playing. No matter what you do, always remember, STAY IN-SYNC WITH THE SONG. That's my #1 never-forget rule. Doesn't matter what you do, you will still look like you are dancing.

If my explanation has holes, or confusing, or some people just downright disagree, I'm all ears. Criticisms can also help me understand some of my flaws. We are always learning, and you can always learn something from ANYONE :D But in the end, I hope I'm helping out some of you people out there!",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_hqsmb,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hqsmb/tips_on_dancing_for_the_true_beginners/,
1376103556.0,174,self.seduction,1k2hru,First time being painfully honest with a girl. Went better than expected.,212,38,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1k2hru/first_time_being_painfully_honest_with_a_girl/,"I went out with the girl from [this](http://redd.it/1jlxpv) FR. We just had some drinks at a bar then went back to my place. Literally as we're getting undressed in bed, she off-handedly asks if I'm seeing other people. I could've easily just lied and told her what she wanted to hear, that she was the only girl I'm seeing, but I didn't. I told her that I was seeing other people. This was most certainly *not* what she wanted to hear. 

I wouldn't call what followed an argument or a fight, but just a long, open discussion. For her part, she just seemed a bit sensitive to the idea that she ""wasn't enough"" and that I must not care very much about her. She even said I should've just lied and that by telling her the truth I was trying to ""show off"" that I was going out with other women and that I am a ""player"". She expressed concern that she wouldn't be able to trust that I would ever be exclusive with her, but I was able to easily shoot that down. ""I'm being painfully honest now. I'm telling you shit you don't want to hear. Why would I lie to you later?""

I calmly explained that the only reason I see multiple people is because I *am* looking to be in an exclusive relationship, but I don't want to make the mistake of getting into one too quickly. I've gotten into relationships quickly before and soon realized that the person wasn't a good match for me. I explained that I wasn't just using her for sex, but that I think sexual chemistry is an important aspect of getting to know someone to determine compatibility. I even told her that if she wanted to date other people I'd be fine with it -- I'd be hypocritical if I held her to different standards than I hold myself to.

Around 3:30 AM, she says that she can't stay and that she has to go home. I offer to walk her to a taxi, but she refuses and says she doesn't want me to come. I say OK and when she's out the door I lock it and go to bed. A minute later, she's knocking on the door.

Her: You didn't come after me

Me: I told you I wouldn't.

At this point, I was getting pretty fed up with the bullshit. I laid it all out on the line:

Look, we've only been on two dates, so we're just getting to know each other, but already it doesn't really seem to be working. There are things you don't like about me and things I don't like about you. Maybe we just shouldn't see each other anymore.

Queue crazy make out. We move to the bed and you can see where it headed. While we were having sex, she said she like ""This was all I wanted tonight. All you had to do was kiss me."" I had gotten the urge to shut her up with a kiss at several points during the discussion, but she seemed legitimately upset and not interested in sex at the moment. 

While she had gotten upset, I think she also got kinda turned on by how honest I was and that I didn't give into her little power play -- leaving and waiting for me to chase after her. She was also interested in sex from the beginning of the night. I mean, I knew that already. I had already had sex with her twice and it was obviously going to happen at the end of the night again, but it's always nice to hear a girl actually admit that she came out with sex on her mind. She even said that she is going to try and date other dudes, but that we can keep seeing each other for casual sex.

The important lesson here is that you need to be honest. Don't be afraid to fuck something up with a girl. If you tell her something she doesn't want to hear and she doesn't want to talk to you again, you have to respect that. There will be more girls. Some of them will be on the same page as you, and that's what you should be pursuing. Starting any kind of relationship with someone under false pretenses and lies will only lead to more drama than it's worth.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_1k2hru,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1k2hru/first_time_being_painfully_honest_with_a_girl/,
1374218708.0,169,self.seduction,1ima8n,An honest issue I have with this subreddit,260,91,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1ima8n/an_honest_issue_i_have_with_this_subreddit/,"I found this sub about three weeks ago. And while I'm new here, I am very accustomed to the game. I was pretty excited to find a place where I could share some knowledge and talk about game. However, there is one very big issue that I have with this sub.


It's great that there are so many users here, the issue is that it seems like beginner material and inner game are the main topics that are posted here. Material that is a lot more comprehensive or more on the advanced levels of game are rejected. Or posts on value building that are more comprehensive are also rejected.

It seems that users who see advice that doesn't suit their needs (whether its above their level or for other reasons) downvote these posts. Also, if it doesn't fit their values or opinions of what they think game should be like, its also downvoted.

It'd be really nice to see material that is above the usual ""be outcome independent and assume attraction"" posts that are always on this sub. But advanced material always seems to get downvoted. 

So if your reading this, it would be great to do the following.

1. Don't downvote a post because its above your level and you may have not found value in it (yet).

2. Don't downvote a post because it doesn't suit your needs or what your looking for. There may be many other people who will benefit from the post.

3. Don't downvote a post because it doesn't line up with your style of game. If someone is leaning towards the asshole side of game (dark triad or whatever) and doesn't have the same values or opinions as you, just let them be so other users with similar interests can pick up some value from their posts. If your in it for self improvement and all they care about is banging as many women as possible, who cares? Don't be dictating what peoples values on game and on relationships should be. We all have our own reasons and beliefs about game, don't downvote someone else because their views don't support yours.

Other things I would recommend:

1314718926.0,173,self.seduction,jz50l,Don’t Read This…....... Unless You are Serious. ,277,104,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/jz50l/dont_read_this_unless_you_are_serious/,"So you are serious about getting good with women? 


Here is the no bullshit way to do this. Mind you, I have spend 5 years of my life dedicated to learning about women, teaching thousands of clients across the world and all that experience has taught me these powerful lessons. I warn you though, if you do the things I am about to say your life is going to change radically. You WILL get girls, you WILL feel more confidence and people WILL say you changed, so if you want to just write posts for the next 3 years about women and not actually go out and change your life, stop reading. 



**Step 1: The Look…**

Women respond to men who dress good. FACT. If you don’t know how clothes are supposed to fit, (most people don’t) then LEARN about it. Here are some good links you laze fuckers :) 


http://www.nsscoaching.com/blog/men-build-confidence-with-fashion-and-style/


http://www.kinowear.com/blog/


Fashion IS important for several reasons and if you neglect it than you are doing yourself a disservice.  Fashion will also give you a huge boost of confidence. I tell students all the time that fashion is the quickest way to get a boost of confidence that will really help you out. Start with this step first. The reason I suggest that is because it doesn’t take long to fix it. Go spend 3 hours in a mall after reading these posts and buy 1 outfit. Have 1 thing that fits right and looks GOOD on you and then over time you will build your style as you buy new pieces. 


**Fashion makes a HUGE difference.**



**Step 2: Get off your ass…**

Stop talking ABOUT women and go talk TO women. All the mental masturbation that transpires on forums is of limited value to your success with women. One hour talking to women is worth at least 10 hours of reading material. Far too often people will post reports about how they said certain lines and ended up with the girl. A guy will read this hoping for success and try to imitate the same lines and end up nowhere. What works for one guy doesn’t always work for another because people have different personalities! 


You have to be social. You are learning social dynamics, not how to be an internet pick up guru. Everyone reading this might think, “sure this is common knowledge” but how many of you went out in the last 3 nights? Stop making excuses like, “I am tired, I have no money.” There are free spots you can go to.  To be good at something requires passion for it. Not just for the pursuit of pussy but for the overall life altering change that comes with getting your dating life under control. 


*People have been getting laid a hell of a lot longer than this community has existed. The community should be a source of inspiration and reference, not a bible for women.*


**Step 3: Get help…**

Find some friends to go out with. Are your friends useless? Make new friends via forums and people in your area that want to improve their social lives. Still getting nowhere? Hire a coach. Coaching speeds up the process of learning significantly! You can progress MUCH faster than you can imagine if you have a coach who is actually GOOD at teaching. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and email people. Hell, I tell people all the time to email me if they have questions. Use the resources that are out there!!! 



**Additional Notes…**

You might be thinking that this information is basic right? I challenge you to actually do these 3 things I listed. Change you look dramatically, go out several nights a week even if no one goes with you and talk to women, get help from friends or a good coach. If you JUST do these 3 things within 6 months you will have more success than you could ever imagine. 


Far too often people make excuses of why they cannot make changes. Phrases like “I cannot afford to go out, I cannot afford to hire a coach, (yes some are really really over priced) I am tired today.” These things are just excuses that hold you back from getting this part of your life taken care of.  Fact is you don’t NEED a coach to be good at this. You don’t NEED a ton of money to go out. All you need is people to interact with. Stop making excuses that are holding you back and do something about it. 


The way to really win “the game” is to eventually not have to “game” anymore. When social skills become a second nature to you then and only then will you have won. 

I hope you find value in this. Feel free to PM me or Email me. Mayson@nsscoaching.com

There are two girls in front of me in line with tongue rings (yummy!) so I chat them up, game them, leave them while their interested. I chat up a cute girl outside, do the Ring routine, get a number and major interest and a coffee date.

I go back to the two girls, put my hands on both their backs, say I've never kissed a girl with a tongue ring before (lie) and kiss the blonde one while still touching the brunette. The brunette gets jelly, we kiss too, she gives me lots of tongue so I can ""Finally kiss a girl with a tongue ring"". I need to get her outside and isolate. ""I'm gonna go for a smoke, wanna come?"" She does. We're outside and I'm starting to take her hand and walk in the direction of my apartment. She says ""Wait, where are we going?"" - My place - ""I should really go back to my friend... I can't leave her"" I put my thumb in her waistline part of her jeans, in the front and say ""Yeah, you really should... if you come with me, we're gonna do bad things together... you don't wanna do that"". She smiles and blushes. ""It would be a really bad idea... you shouldn't walk this way with me"" as I stroke her waistline under her jeans. She says ""I can't take this! Lets go!""

Fast forward ten minutes, I'm telling her to give me head. She doesn't. I suggest it again and ask if it feels different with a tongue ring... she doesn't do it. I pull the reverse psychology again ""I'll make you a deal.... you go down on me BUT DON'T make me cum. Then I'll put on a condom and we can have sex"" The issue is no longer whether or not she should do it, but that she shouldn't make me cum when she's doing it. Now that I gave her a new frame to view it, she goes down and does her thing. After I've had my fill, I throw on the condom and go to town. It was kinda funny, she was like ""Ohhhhh, ohhhhh Where did you come from?!??!""

 The answer is ""I came from Seddit"".

1304775392.0,167,self.seduction,h62fu,Calibration 101,202,35,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/h62fu/calibration_101/,"Hi guys.

I just watched the [Adam Lyons video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlJLLjE9_To) that was linked and I realized we didn't have a great post regarding calibration. He went into great detail regarding the different personality types of women and what they find attractive and unattractive, based on actual psychological studies and not just pseudo-science.

---

**Here are the four archetypes that women are most attracted to:**

* *Nice guy* (stereotypical strength: being nice, stereotypical weakness: being needy)
* *Leader* (stereotypical strength: taking charge &amp; being social, stereotypical weakness: being bossy)
* *Bad boy* (stereotypical strength: being spontaneous, stereotypical weakness: being an asshole)
* *Provider* (stereotypical strength: buying gifts, stereotypical weakness: being insecure)

---

**Female personality types (based on [PEN model](http://www.personalityresearch.org/pen.html)):**

* *Psychotic* (crazy, risky, wild, promiscuous)
* *Extrovert* (outgoing, friendly, not shy)
* *Neurotic* (shy, not extroverted, can be pessimistic)

---

* *Psychotics* respond mostly to *Bad Boys* (they enjoy risky behavior - stereotypical slutty, party girls)
* *Extroverts* respond mostly to *Leaders* (they enjoy someone who can require them to be social)
* *Neurotics* respond mostly to *Nice Guys* (it makes them feel good to have a nice guy in their lives) and to a lesser extent, *Providers* (safety, comfort)

---

The idea is to understand that you can develop and possess characteristics of all four attractive male archetypes. This will allow you to adapt your personality on the fly (read: calibrate) to be the type that will be most attractive to the woman you are talking to.

It's also entirely possible to display the positive traits of *ALL* the personality archetypes while *DROPPING* the negative traits (e.g. doing nice gestures but not being needy. Or taking charge and deciding where to go on dates but not doing things she won't find enjoyable.) This is fully in line with the [Characteristics of a Modern Alpha Male](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fobhj/lesson_1_primer_on_being_a_modern_alpha_male/) that I wrote for our Inner Game series.

Understanding how to calibrate for the three different personality types will help take your game to the next level. Like anything else, this requires applied field research and practice.

It's also important to calibrate for a girl's energy level.

Related to the studies, they found the two most UNATTRACTIVE qualities of men are poor hygiene &amp; lack of sense of humor. So brush your teeth, wash your hair, and smile! ;)

Lastly, understanding these personality types will help you as you qualify the women you meet. This should allow you to meet women you truly desire. E.g. if you know you don't like outgoing, extroverted girls and prefer quieter, introspective ones, you want to play up your nice guy side (but drop the neediness). I bet this is good news for a lot of you out there.

There you go, guys. This is the very core of calibration and it's backed by legitimate psychological studies.

---

**EDIT:** Thanks to maukka for the test link. I believe it'd be helpful to take the online PEN test ([link here](http://similarminds.com/eysenck.html)) and see what your breakdown is between the three personality types. You'll see that no one is 100% one type, however one will be more dominant. It'll help you get a deeper understanding of how calibration works.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_h62fu,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/h62fu/calibration_101/,

A little bit of background about me, because I'm sure you're all going, ""who the hell is this guy?!"" Well let me tell you, I'm nobody extraordinary. I am just a normal guy like all of you who worked my ass off and made dating and meeting women my passion.


Originally from the Midwest, I moved out to LA over 5 years ago knowing very few people. I was always a social guy but only within my group of friends that I knew since my early childhood. I didn't know the first thing about talking to women I didn't know, or flirting with the girls I was truly attracted to.


Before I came out to LA I picked up the book, ""The Game"" like anyone else, but I denied all that PUA stuff for years. In reality, I was just too scared to go out and break out of my comfort zone. After a few months and ending a terrible long distance relationship, I had a change of mind. I made dating, going out to bars/clubs, and socializing my passion. I went out 3-5x a week for about 3 years straight. Sometimes I would go out for 2-3 weeks in a row without stopping. There was never any drinking involved. In fact I stopped all bad habits: smoking, drinking, and eating shitty. I wanted to reform myself entirely.


Along my journey I created a popular podcast on iTunes, *Dudes Talking About Chicks*, which some of you may have heard of and a web series, *The Social Rules*, both about dating advice. Around 2 years ago I created my own company, TrippAdvice. I became so passionate during my journey that I wanted to make this a career and help other guys succeed, just like I did. It's not a fad. I'm in this for the long haul. In fact, I just finished my first e-book with some solid advice I gained over the years which you can get for free on my website. Most of my advice comes from the successes and failures I had in the field while some comes from forums on the internet I was active on while I went through my journey. I've worked with men ages 18-61 and it's been incredible.


With that said, AMA.

It ends up working on them, as they're teaching me.",208,38,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ikrcw/fr_girls_teach_me_how_to_pushpull_body_rocking/,"My drunk friend has already approached this set and number closed one of the girls. We're in the men's room, and he tells me to STOP being a dancing entertaining monkey, and take myself seriously. Good shit. Finally I do a good set, after a night of blowing out EVERYWHERE (some good moments but not worthy of mention here).

HB6, HB7.5, HB7.5.

I go in pretty half assed, 3 girls I had tried to unsuccessfully open before (but which my drunk friend managed to number close). ""Hey you girls looking for guys? Pick any guy out in the bar, I'll get him to come over here to say hi.""

After a while of joking around looking for guys, they were like, ""OK, we want to talk to this guy."" Pointing at me.

""You guys need to pick a better-looking guy."" (I'm wearing my glasses from the 8th grade and an poor-fitting shirt, from not having had a chance to change.) ""Oh you're plenty goodlooking enough!""

So I go, ""You know, I suck at picking up girls in bars. You guys gotta coach me."" They start teaching me to pretend I don't care. Pretend I'm checking out other girls while I'm talking to them. So I go, ""Sorry? What were you saying?"" A lot of role playing, as I do physical push-pull on all of them. ""Oh and you gotta ask for names."" We do names. Then they taught me to do BODY ROCKING. ""Pretend you're gonna walk away from us, but don't walk away.""

I just went from the creeper (I tried opening this set earlier in the night) to the guy who's playful and has a sense of humor, and giving them a good time.

A group of my goodlooking friends just come up to me, asking me a couple questions, disregarding the girls completely, great social proof.

A girl just texted me, ""I'm sad u didn't call me tdy."" Perfect, I show that text to HB7.5. She goes, ""Is that your girlfriend?"" I whip out my inbox and all these girls names on my inbox. ""I don't know. I don't get girls, all these girls just want to date me, but won't want to fuck me."" An older HB8 overhears me and laughs, I get in a 5 minute conversation with her, making her laugh her ass off, but I showed some creepy interest right at the end, making her go finally order her drink at the bar. All good, because all these girls saw was that I made this woman laugh her ass off. While I was in conversation, I was kinda straddling one of the HB7.5 (NOT my target), her back was to me, so her ass was kinda bumping into my crotch accidentally. She kept looking back, but I don't think it was obvious to me or her what was really going on.

I come back to my target with: ""Have you ever gone out with a guy you met at a bar?"" ""Never."" ""So when are we having our first fight?"" ""We're gonna fight, and then you're gonna leave, not text me, not call me. Then I'm gonna call you, crying. And you're gonna come back to me, and you gotta tell me, 'I love you babe.'"" GOLD. So I lean into her and say, ""I love you babe."" And grab her ass. ""OMG, you just groped my ass."" I lean into her ear. ""Yea and you totally wanted it."" She giggles.

""Oh I heard girls like getting their hair pulled too."" ""Yeah?"" I go in, grab some of her hair, gently. ""Yeahhh."" ""Hahaha, he's pulling my hair."" Her friend goes, ""Oh she loves getting her hair braided.""

After awhile, the friend goes, ""You're totally her type!"" A little while later, the friend goes, ""Give her a neck massage!"" I proceed. My target: ""You're so gentle with me. Harder!"" I lean into her ear, ""Harder, babe?!"" My target squirms with giggles, as I lean into her, she puts her head down exposing her neck completely and I'm really digging into her neck (never done this before, not sure WTF I was doing LOL). Her friends crack up. I keep doing this for awhile, guys looking at me like: WTF, Asian dude in nerdy glasses and an over-sized shirt making 3 girls have a tingly time. I feel like tonight I was being THAT guy.

Their HB6 friend is literally now pawing my left arm for attention. Scratching my arm with her fingernails. I do the neck massage to her, I talk into her ear, she squirms with glee, but she pretends like she doesn't like it. So I keep doing it to both my target and HB6. Whispering, ""I'm trying to make you jealous. I heard this jealousy thing works really well.""

My friend comes to grab me. ""Dude we're leaving."" ""I'm having so much fun with these girls!"" Girls laugh. He grabs me and starts DRAGGING me out, and I struggle, and throw my phone at my target, while my friend is dragging me away.

She dials her number, calls the number, but she saw she fumbled the digits. So she tries again, re-dials her correct number into my phone, calls, and waits until it goes into her voicemail, she starts talking into the phone. I come into the set, grab the phone, and start talking into the phone, ""So I just met this gorgeous girl in a red dress. She's fucking hot. Never mind, actually, I don't care, I don't CARE."" (Cuz they told me to pretend I don't care when I talk to girls.) They laugh, and my friend finally pulls me away.

**Lessons Learned**

Well these girls literally told me what worked with girls, and I tried it out on THEM, and it worked on them. Good to get more experience with: physical push pull, role-play, ""pretending I don't care and they don't have my full attention"", body rocking, kino, neck massage, hair pulling, giving value, having a sense of humor, dominating the set, jealousy, plowing through an initially totally shitty set.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_ikrcw,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ikrcw/fr_girls_teach_me_how_to_pushpull_body_rocking/,

*Upon telling her no, she said maybe she would have to find someone else to buy her cigarettes. I casually told her that she totally should..... The old me would have succumbed for fear of her losing interest, falling for a shit test.


*As we sat on the bench in the park, I continually escalated kino and held eye contact. I Got really close and asked, ""Do you know what I want to do?"" she replied a knowing ""what?"" with a romantic expression. I told her I really wanted her to kiss me once on the cheek, with a serious tone, which she responded well to and did..... The old me would have made out at any cost, escalating as quickly as possible.

*When I did go in for the kiss, I waited until she was telling me a story. I politely and suddenly stopped her, saying, ""I'm sorry to interrupt, sorry, this will just take a second. I'm going to kiss you."" I went for the kiss, was the first to retract, and told her, ""Okay, sorry. Go ahead with your story."" ..... The old me? Well, he probably would have been bitching about how this girl just wanted a hug at the end of the date.

So anyways, I just now realized how much useful shit I've learned from here, and am grateful for the encouragement to get out there. Knowledge without action is useless.

1344255469.0,167,self.seduction,xrg89,My oneitis dropped the bomb on me this morning. I have never felt more motivated in my life,209,42,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xrg89/my_oneitis_dropped_the_bomb_on_me_this_morning_i/,"Today is the 6th of august 2012.

2:00 AM in the morning.

I haven't had a job for like a year. I desperately try to quit smoking to get in shape. When I look at myself in the mirror, even my face has become fatter.  I try to socialize, find more friends, meet new people, and in the end I’m the one sitting at home all the time playing video games, imagining that I was the hero in those stories. I haven't had sex in half a year, and that doesn’t even really count since it was my ex-girlfriend and we used to hook up regularly after our breakup. The last time I had 'new sex' with a woman was last November. And on top of all that, I failed to play it cool when the girl I really like just told me that she fucked some other dude in his car while she was drunk last weekend.

Today is the 6th of august 2012. And now I am going to change everything.

It is 1 pm now and I just smoked my last cigarette. I think quitting is easy, I’ve done it a thousand times (ha ha). But this time will be different. This time I will pull this off, this is my first necessary step of my transformation. You can’t get in shape when you can’t even walk up the fucking stairs without losing breath as I do.

The girl I like is studying in Brazil right now, the next time I will see her will be August 2013. She will study in France at this time; which means I have one year to get my fucking ass up and do something about my current dissatisfying situation. I am not doing this for her, but her confession about that guy was the last bit of motivation I needed. 
Worse thing about that is, I just HAD to ask her which guy she was fucking and she showed me his Facebook profile, resulting in the realization that this guy was everything I wanted to be at this point of my life.
Of course I knew that this was a stupid idea before I even asked, but I am sure that many guys out there can relate to my current situation. You don’t wanna know but you just HAVE to know. When you are suffering from oneitis, your logical mind doesn’t work anymore and your emotional one is a real fucking asshole.

When I went shopping for groceries this morning, I saw a girl that looked just like her, same hairstyle, same eyes, same body; and I thought to myself that something cosmic was making fun of me right now. Of course this is bullshit, I don’t believe in higher power or some kind of god at all, but this showed me how fucking miserable I was. I haven't felt like this since I was a teenager, always chasing the girls who saw nothing more than a friend in me and ended up telling me how much they liked this other guy. God damn, I really thought I learned how to deal with those kinda situations; turns out I am just on the beginning of my journey.

But what helps me is the fact that I put this girl on a pedestal. I have been searching for 'oneitis' in the seduction subreddit and it soon became pretty clear to me. It has been some time since a girl showed some interest in me so I totally focused on this girl, thought that no one could ever be as important to me as her, and put myself in this miserable situation.

I can’t issue that enough: I am not doing this for this particular girl. I am doing this because I know that I need to change my life, to become the man I want to be. I have been reading lots of material on self-improvement socially, interaction with the other sex and stopping smoking lately. But I needed some motivation to being with, and this was just this one thing that set the ball rolling.

This is My One Year Project. Now don’t get me wrong; I want to improve and change my life on almost every aspect, but not just for a year, for good. I will become the man I always wanted to be. I realized that I am the only one who is responsible for my luck, and seeing this particular girl again one year from now will be my personal kick in the ass to begin with. 

Living well is the best revenge they say, but living well eliminates the need for revenge. I will be successful and I am pretty sure after I started improving my life, I won’t even give a fuck about her anymore. But right now this is the thing that pushes me and I will put all my anger, my sadness, my jealousy and my agony into this to benefit and learn from it.
Fuck you world, I am back.

Thanks for reading. Feel free to tell me whatever you want to tell me.

BTW: i thought about posting this to other subreddits instead of this one, but i think that you guys will understand my current situation and state of mind best.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,1344255839.0,,,True,t3_xrg89,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xrg89/my_oneitis_dropped_the_bomb_on_me_this_morning_i/,

Been visiting this subreddit for about a month now and I'm really enjoying the community. I'm finally deciding to contribute so let me know what you guys think.

Last night I went sarging with a buddy of mine in vegas. If any of you have been down here you know how crazy and extravagant the clubs are. They're packed with celebrities, old men, dbags, and some of the most beautiful girls the world can offer. Now after standing in line for about an hour and losing some pregame buzz we finally make it through the doors. I say hey to this HB8 as soon as I walk in and she just tells me to fuck off and go die. This amazing start had me yearning for more so I chat up a few other people as we made our way to the bar, my friend trying to get in on these walk by sets by shaking hands and being friendly. We make it to the bar and turn on our hottie senses. Over his shoulder, about 20 feet away, I see this gorgeous girl with a group of friends. I signal to him but he tells me that he's just gonna stay with the 3 set of girls we just opened up.

I decide that I had to approach this HB9/10 so I start making my way through the crowd to her. Now idk how I came up with this opener on the walk over but it worked like a charm. I ran up to her and gave her a big hug, kind of pushing her back about 2 feet from her group. Before she had a chance to say anything I say ""Hey I haven't seen you in forever what have you been up to?"" She gives me a funny face and asks ""do I know you?"" I say ""Come on Hillary, It's me your cousin Will. My mom sent me over to live with your Family in Uncles Phil's house in Bel Air. Wow Cousin Carlton said you'd changed"" as I'm telling her this a big smile pops up on her face and she starts laughing. She gives me a big hug and tells me that she's missed me too.

I tell her to introduce me to her friends and I introduce myself as her cousin Will. Her friends are cool with me and instantly accept me in the circle. I start telling embarrassing stories about the time I accidentally gave her night time meds for her cold when she was at work. Also, about the time we novice chef's made enough food for an entire bar mitzvah just to show off to some girls she hated. Anyway she's eyeing me down with every story I tell so I decided it's time to make my move and told her friends that we're gonna go get drinks and catch up. I isolate her and she starts asking me questions like who I really am and where I'm from. We have a fun little convo, maintain lots of kino the whole time then I go for the makeout. While kissing, her friend jumps in between us and is like wtf are you kissing cousins. She explains we're not really cousins, and her friend laughs at my story and says it was really funny.

Fast forward a bit, my friend took one of the girls at the bar home, and I'm back in set with my girl. Her friends are all clubbed out and are about to leave so we exchange numbers. She's about to leave but I stop her and say ""you're coming home with me tonight"" she gives me a big smile, says ok and tells her friends. We get food and as we're eating she's sitting on my lap. I pull a washington monument, fiddle with pleasure button and I get the F-close with her in my car next to a bag of In-N-Out. Looks like she wants to continue since she send me a little extra in a text pic this morning.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_smws8,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/smws8/fr_do_i_know_you/,
1329058320.0,170,self.seduction,pm2ah,[FR] OKC Date---&gt; Sex at her place,216,46,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pm2ah/fr_okc_date_sex_at_her_place/,"So, months ago I described how I went on 2 okc dates that felt flat.  I recently got active on that site again and made sure to take TofuTofu's advice, especially the part about telling her to meet you very early on.  We exchanged phone numbers.  I said I'd invite her out sometime.  A few days pass, she asks me if I'm free Friday night.  I have something going on that night, but I say I'm free afterwards.  She's cool with that.  She asks where we should meet for a drink.  I use yelp(so very, very useful for finding good places in whatever neighborhood you expect to be in) to find a bar that's cool, good for a date, and just a walk from the event I'm attending earlier in the night.


I arrive before her and I'm a bit buzzed.  Earlier event was at another bar where I had a couple beers and talked to strangers about common interests.  She's late, but she shows up.  I get her a glass of wine.  We talk and we vibe.  She's smart and playful.  I say whatever I want.
Things I specifically intended to do and carried through on:
- Eye contact.  I've heard more than once here that AWKWARD PAUSES ARE A GIFT.  THEY ARE FOR YOU TO BUILD SEXUAL TENSION.  LOOK HER IN THE EYES.  PUSH YOUR COMFORT ZONE.  EXCITE HER AND COMMUNICATE INTEREST.  So, I did. Sometimes, it just ended with a giggle from both of us and then we'd get back to talking.

-kino  I didn't kino early.  I didn't have her sit next to me.  We sat across from each other at a small candlelit table.  However, when our legs touched under the table, I KEPT MY LEG THE FUCK THERE.

-internalizing the idea that I have to see if she's cool enough for me.  This made it easier to talk to her.  I wasn't trying to ask the right questions to keep her interested.  I was trying to see if she interested me. And when she did I was willing to say when I was impressed.  

-have fun.

-don't reject myself.  Added that to my inner game.  I don't reject myself.  That means I make choices that reflect that.  It also means I speak unashamedly about my current situation as someone who is unemployed and without his own place.


So, things go well.  Some of our conversation makes me want to confirm something I said in another FR many months ago: it's good to talk about each other.  Talk about yourself, but get to talking about each other.  What type of person does she seem like to you?  After that story or interest she shares, what do you think of her?

After a long while, we leave.  She wants to eat.  We find a place nearby for a bite.  Conversation continues.  She's already mentioned that I live really far away and wonders how I'm going to get home.  She said I could stay on her couch.  She says her room is messy but I'll never see it anyway.  I DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE NONSENSE.  Just, ""that's cool.""

We catch a cab.  The driver is playing his music loudly.  We start dancing in the back.  She stops and while she's talking she turns to me and locks on.  I know now that she's waiting to be kissed.  You don't always have to wait for this, but to recognize it is nice.  Want to know what it looks like?  You know that scene in The Lion King when Simba returns all grown-up and he and Nala wrestle again like when they were kids, but Simba pins her to the ground this time.  Then, Nala gives him a look and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" starts playing.  It's that look.  So, I kiss her, but pull away first.

At her house, soon after entering, I get that look again and we kiss.  She says something about me staying in her bed, but no sex.  Ok.

In bed, lots of LMR.  Maybe more experienced sedditors can suggest what more should have been done before getting to bed so this doesn't come up anymore.  

Anyway, I never let it bother me.  I don't try to convince her otherwise with conversation or act disappointed.  It's no big deal.  We kiss.  Sometimes, she pushes me away and I comically act like she shoved me.  Sometimes, she's saying no sex and then wanting to ask me questions.  I got used to thinking of LMR as the woman not wanting to be seen as or think of herself as a slut, but I got something else here.  She wanted to make sure I was interested in her for more than just sex.  I guess that was something I could have communicated better earlier in the night.  I wasn't making any promises to be her bf and she knew that, but she didn't want me to sleep with her and then never talk to her again.  That was not my intention and I said so.  Eventually, she changes her mind without me trying to convince her.  

Honestly, I'm not sure sex was the right choice for me.  It wasn't necessary.  I didn't last long (embarrassing!).  And then I wasn't very interested in going another round.  I could see myself hanging with this girl again for sure, but whether we have sex again or not isn't very important to me.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_pm2ah,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pm2ah/fr_okc_date_sex_at_her_place/,
1323121946.0,168,self.seduction,n1m0r,"Reminder: Read her Actions, not her Words",202,34,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/n1m0r/reminder_read_her_actions_not_her_words/,"A week ago I went camping with a group of people I had never met.  I was getting interest signals from several attractive women there, but not all of them - and specifically I was not getting  much from a petite 5'1"" Asian girl who I found particularly attractive.  I've reached the point where I do enjoy the chase... I made sure to find some time just myself and her during a hike mid trip, and when breaking down the camp at the end of the weekend.  I'm sure she noticed that I was doing these things.  She was unresponsive to kino, but did continue to drop verbal hints (at least, under my attraction assumptions, they sounded like hints).  She told me that ""Men who easily attract women are sometimes frustrated by me"" and that ""sometimes men can't tell when I'm into them"".  Further, she seemed to be trying to DHV a bit at times (she demonstrated her yoga handstand prowess - super hot when a woman can lift her legs in the air with control like that, sit stable in a hand stand, then slowly lower them back down to earth).  I decided she was interested, but guarded.  After packing everything up, the group said farewells in the parking lot.  I wasn't going to # close her in front of everybody (to number close only the hot girl in a group in this setting would not have been cool - besides I knew I could get her email address from the website).  She made a point of providing me her email address verbally to a group of guys I was standing with.  I again assumed attraction (and memorized it).  **At this point I'm mostly reading between the lines and assuming attraction**.

I drive home, shower, take it easy, and don't get around to emailing her.

The next morning she emails me.  She had looked up my email address on the website.  **She tells me she'll be on a future outing, signs the email and finished with her phone number.  Interesting.  She must want me to use it.**  I text her about my yoga practice that night (I was doing a challenge in November, 25 sessions in one month - I had just finished number 23).  She replies promptly.  Seems that was not out of place.

Five days pass. I'm busy, don't get around to emailing her or lining anything up.  She emails me a coupon for a free session at her yoga studio (and cc's another friend of hers).  I'm not going to go alone, but I think to myself: maybe I'll ask her to join me.  but I'm busy.  I don't email her back yet.

The morning of the sixth day she emails me: ""I recommend &lt;instructor&gt;, she teaches 1-3PM on Sundays.  I'll be gone much of December but am planning to go on the 17th.""

Assuming attraction, she provided me with a time and place, might as well follow her lead.  So I tell her I'll join her the 17th.  Easy.  I email her back and we set it up. She follows up with some hint of availability before the  17th.  So I follow through on that also, we line up a date for Sunday (yesterday).  There were several back-and-forth in setting up a time, she was really seeming to make an effort to find a time that worked for both of us.  More evidence of interest.

I arrive, we eat dinner together, good food and conversation.  Some flirting.  No kino.  Split the bill and I suggest that we go ice skating.  She counters with a walk (she broke her tailbone twice last year in falls), I accept that sounds safer and so we head to the beach.  I'm upping the kino a bit (I'm getting pretty into this girl.  She's my body type, has common interests, and I can tell she has put a lot of effort into getting her life in order).  But she is not responding positively.  An arm on the back goes noticed, but no obvious reciprocation.  An arm around her shoulder and she's not acting all that emotionally warm.  **But she is still with me.  She hasn't suggested we end the evening.  So though something is up, her actions indicate she's not out of this yet.**  We sit on a swingset on the beach and start really honestly talking.  Pretty rapidly she's telling me she likes to start off friends, that she has attachment issues when things get physical, and that she has male friends who want to date her but she's not attracted to.  My immediate impression is that she gets lots of attention, emotional contact, and general near-boyfriend experiences from these guy friends in her life.  Big red flag!

What do I do? I tell her straight up that I am not in the business of hanging out with a woman weekly just to be friends.  Not a woman I'm attracted to.  I tell her that sex is important, and that I understand her position (that some women become quite attached fast when sex enters the picture) but that sex is a huge part of a relationship and I'm not willing to spend too long dating before that compatibility is tested.  Her response? She starts to test me.  The vibe? She is recognizing that she won't be able to make a new orbiting friend.  If she wants me to stick around, she is going to have to treat me like more than a friend.  **She wants me to change her opinion of things.  She wants me to help her fall for me.  She could have left the swingset, but she stayed and kept asking questions.**

**Her words were repeatedly: We will just be friends.**

**Her actions in response to my declining the offer: Staying with me, talking, laughing, challenging me.**

We end up back at this hotel lobby and talking for another hour.  She's opening up to me. Rotating in her seat, facing me (I'm facing 90 degrees to her).  I kino on her thigh as she sits there sometimes, but she does not reciprocate.  But she's still there.  She's still interested.  There is a vibe.

10:30 PM (date started 5:30) she pays the bill and drives me to my car.  En route I bring up uncertainty over her sexual repression (conversation earlier had made me concerned - so I wanted to screen her).  Result? Thirty minutes of talking about sex, what she likes, laser hair treatment down below, likes and dislikes in male anatomy, and much more.  Pretty clearly she's changed in her posture towards me.  **She is acting a bit like she is afraid she has ruined her chances with me.**  I tell her it is getting late, wish her a safe drive home and move to get out of the car.

Her: ""Don't I get a goodnight hug?""

I grumble (I don't like end-of-date closes of any sort really, why bother if it's not leading to more that evening) but climb back in, give her a hug.

Her with a concerned face: ""Are we dating?""

Me in my head: LOL WTF knew it

Me: ""We are hanging out""

She lights up.

Her: ""Can I kiss you?""

**I grab her by the nape of her neck and we makeout for 15 seconds.**  I release her, climb out of the car and wave.  Walk to my car.

She emailed me this morning with her availability next weekend.

**TL;DR; Woman pursues electronPua, he accepts advances and invites her on a date.  Woman claims date isn't a date, she wants to be friends but emotional and talky talky.  ElectronPua rejects offer for orbiting male status. Woman changes outlook on electronPua, makes out with electronPua.

I'm 21, Asian, studied engineering. I often visit seddit, but I focus more on natural game, been a recovering AFC for the past 4 years, learned by myself how to be alpha, learned by myself how to be high value, been improving my confidence and my looks for a while, just starting to try out some routines and sets here and there, I've had moderate success up until this last year, when my hard work started paying off for me in a big way. This is my first post so be understanding if my post is not up to seddit's FR standards.

Just graduated from a 4 year uni, and I've had possibly the most epic 2 weeks of my life. Basically college graduation is pretty much the perfect storm for picking up any girl you want from the graduating class. There's been pretty much constant drinking starting from the end of finals, non stop social events and partying as people try to reconnect with everyone before they leave, everybody just finished their work and have nothing to do but blow off steam, all of her friends are leaving, giving her a crazy emotional cocktail of nostalgia, excitement for the next stage in her life, fear of the unknown, sadness, and most importantly: a feeling of urgency and surrealism.

Basically a gold mine. What I've essentially been doing is calling every single girl I've ever been attracted to and asking her to either (depending on the girl)
---
1. meet up one on one at some quiet venue to ""catch up"" or ""spend quality time together"" or ""say goodbye in person""
2. invite her to a large social gathering where the only person she'll know there was me (I could basically cram 5 or 6 girls into the same evening)
3. openly just inviting her to fuck

Not every single invitation was accepted right away, but the most important thing was **nobody ever said no**. Even girls I don't really know that well, girls who I've barely met, nobody wants to be thought of as a shitty friend at graduation.

I'll give a sample FR of how each one of those three scenarios played out.
---
***
1) Ex-girlfriend, she dumped me for a total wet blanket 15 months or so ago, whatever her loss, gotten hotter senior year after learning how to do her hair and makeup properly, and dressing better (HB-6 then, HB-7 now). I invite her to lunch (I literally had a date to a party right afterwards and that was the only time I could fit her in).

She shows up in this super hot club-y dress to a lunch date, says she has somewhere to go after this and didn't want to have to change, I knew better. That gets me super in state. We're sitting outside at this super swanky lunch place, she tries to sit down across the table from me, but I move her so she is sitting next to me (Are you wearing sunblock? Come sit in the shade so you don't burn). We make small talk and order food, I'm touching her on the shoulder all the time to emphasize points, grabbing her arm to point things out on the street around us, touching her hands to look at her class ring. Our food comes and the gloves come off the table.

So when did you realize breaking up with me was a bad idea? She blushes immediately and I keep going. When did you realize [wet blanket, let's call him doug] was a total wet blanket? She immediately starts apologizing and trying to qualify herself to me, saying she was really stupid back then, she didn't really know how great a guy I was back then, she's more mature now and she knows what she does was a mistake. I just start openly talking shit about doug, and it turns out she broke up with him after a few months (something I didn't even know had happened). She laughs and agrees and we had a good conversation talking shit about doug. 

Lunch ends and I pick up the check (I'm making a lot of money now) she insists on buying me coffee to repay me, so we walk to a nearby cafe she really likes, when my date to the party texts me (she's also my ride). I'm openly texting this other chick when she's buying me coffee. Who's that you're texting? Oh it's just [date, let's call her nat], we're going to a party later together. What type of party? The two of us got invited to an all day rooftop kegger in [super expensive part of town]. She's giving me puppy dog eyes at this point, clearly she wants to me to invite her and clearly I'm not going to do it. Nat pulls up in front of the cafe, so I grab my coffee and walk out the door and thank her for coffee. She practically runs out after me and asks me for a goodbye hug. I'm in super dgaf mode so I just look her in the eye and straight up caveman makeout with her in the middle of a busy sidewalk in broad daylight while Nat waits for me right outside in a car. Several dudes catcall, Nat rolls her eyes. We finish kissing and I hop in Nat's car and I promise to stay in touch, etc, before driving off to my next party.
***
2) I'm at a bar with a whole bunch of people, about 50/50 girls/guys. Very popular bar near campus with a lot of kids from my school we know coming in and out. I run into this super cute indian chick, HB-8 at least, who I've literally never met before, so I ask one of my friends (who is good friends with one of the kids she came in with) what her name is, and he tells me she's [let's call her Anika]. I'd already been doing well all night so I was in super Alpha mode. I go up to her when she's at the bar and say Anika! I can't believe how long it's been! She looks super confused and embarrassed that she doesn't know me. I'm like, remember [one of the guys she came in]'s parties sophomore year? We used to play beer pong together, I'm chanyourmind! She does one of those fake I just remembered moments and says oh yeah, chanyourmind, I sort of remember now. I start teasing her for not remembering me. Clearly you have way too many friends to remember me, I'm honestly hurt, you should buy me a drink. (Most of these quotes are paraphrased, I don't remember exact phrasing of what I said).

We talk about life and get into a super hillarious conversation about 50 shades of grey (trust me, every single girl has a hilarious story about 50 shades of grey). I pull her over to my table (you remember [my friend] right, you should come hang out with us) and she starts drinking with a few of my friends, some of whom she knows. I ask her if she's ever seen a particular room in the bar we're at (it's really cool, filled with celebrity pictures with the owner of the bar), and she says she hasn't, so I lead her over. This side of the bar is pretty much deserted, the room is empty.

We go in and I use a line that I got from Jon Simm's [sins of attraction video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbB8AuTBouY). So if you could be doing anything in the world right now, what would you do? Probably hang out with friends. That's not an answer, you can be hanging out with friends doing anything. Well I guess I would go to a music festival. Why? I don't know, because I guess I enjoy music and spending time with people. She has this look of panic on her face like she's afraid she's not interesting enough for me. So I cut her off. Do you know what I'd do? What? I'd travel everywhere, I want to kiss pretty girls from around the world. She does the whole routine where she pretends to be offended at how much of a player I am. I don't apologize and look her in the eye and say, I think white girls from America are so boring, they're brought up in uninteresting families leading uninteresting lives of no importance and act so smug and entitled to their boring little existence, they lack a perspective that other countries have, and that makes girls from those countries so much more attractive. The look on her face was absolutely pure money. Ended up k-closing her right then and there and going back to her place for a bj.

3) There's this girl who I've known pretty well for a long time, never hooked up with her because she's had a boyfriend all the time I've known her. One day I get bored and I start texting her (she still has summer school so she was in class), but she keeps ignoring me. Out of the blue I say I wanna do dirty things to you ;). She immediately responded and she sounded shocked. I respond with I thought that would get your attention. Her: I'm not that easy, you need to try harder.

I was bored so I started texting her nasty, nasty shit in the middle of class, and she gets progressively more and more offended until she stops responding altogether. I kept texting her for a while after she stopped responding, and after her class was over, I call her, and she goes, chanyourmind, we need to talk about what happened today. I invite her out to a bar nearby that I know she likes, she agrees.

We go to the bar and I buy her a drink, and she's still super mad at me. I apologize for making her feel uncomfortable, which was a big AFC move on my part, but I could tell that she was interested and basically was looking for an excuse to hook up with me without looking like a slut. We start talking, friendly at first, casual and non sexual, talking about stuff like friends leaving. She starts getting bored and keeps looking at her watch. She has class the next morning, she has reading to do, etc. At this point I've almost given up on hooking up with her, having not been in state all night, but before we leave, I learn over and whisper in her ear, ""I still wanna do dirty things to you"". She resists at first, so I invite her to come with me and break into the university's rooftop. It's pouring rain outside, we run to her car and get soaking wet on the way there, I joke about drowning on the roof in the open, and she says she likes the rain. We make it to campus, I break into one of the buildings and get the roof access open, she just runs out into the rain and I follow her. We get absolutely soaked, commence epic makeout session on the roof in the rain. I'm not a huge fan of water so I take her into one of the student offices to dry off, we get out of our wet clothes and F-close there.



Truly epic week, I ended up k-closing close to 15 girls, f-closing 4, #-closing zero in two weeks, a personal record for me.

1344064723.0,169,self.seduction,xnvqy,[FR] After work dinner turns into 6am threesome + new F buddy. Also dealt with last minute IN BED cockblock. ,205,36,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xnvqy/fr_after_work_dinner_turns_into_6am_threesome_new/,"So every few weeks at my work a group of us go out for BYO dinner and drinks. Last night we went out, and at dinner there were perhaps 15 of us who all know each other in varying degrees. I'm pretty good friends with about 10 of them.  So we were sitting at the table and I'm sitting in the middle of the table and have one of my male friends on my right and the HB6 from my THIS http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wxz10/does_amazing_nsa_sex_with_one_girl_make_her/  Night out on my left. There are only 5 girls at this dinner. One is my mates girlfriend, the others range from HB6-9. 

Anyway the second hottest girl there is an HB8.5 and she's one that I've kinda thought might be keen for a while, but I never made a move when I worked near her and when she changed departments I never really saw her much anymore. So HB6 and I are having a bit of banter, and then she leaves to go have a cigarette. I don't want one so I stay at the table, and HB8.5 comes and sits next to me. as she was further down the table before and we start small talking e.g. how have you been, what have you been upto etc.. And then she asks me if I'm seeing anyone. I tell her that I'm not seeing anyone exclusively, and then turn the question on her. She tells me that she's been texting this guy for about a month, and that they've met up a few times but he doesn't seem interested in sleeping with her and that she's getting really frustrated.

Someone else interrupts at this point so we don't get to continue the conversation, but when HB6 returns she sees that HB8.5 has come to sit next to me and decides to go and take another place at the table which she later told me was so that I could have a good shot at getting into her(awesome girl).  So me and HB8.5 are chatting most of the evening, I'm teasing her a bit and kinoing (shoulders, arms, hands, ears(earrings) and thigh), which she responds really well to by touching me back. and we talk about her travel plans and I give her some travel tips (DHV). 

Now there's another girl at work who I have a running joke that I'm married to as I was the one who trained her, and we can be a bit touchy feely at times, tell each other that we love each other etc. Probably an HB9(has a bf). As we're paying the bill, HB9 tells me I'm an awful husband as I didn't pay for her. I tell her that I've had enough of her whining and that I'm leaving her for HB8.5 and go and put my arm around her. She responds and puts both her arms around me and we tease HB9 for a while. 

Anyway then we all head to the pub, and have a few jugs and watch the Olympics. At this point I play pool with some friends and end up generally losing track of HB8.5 and she starts to chat to one of my work mates. She seems like she's pretty into him, and when I go outside for a cigarette I hear her telling him the same story about the guy she's been texting for a month.  She calls me over to sit down next to her (she's sitting opposite my workmate) and I do, she then asks me what I think. I tell her I think that she seriously needs to get laid, and tease her a bit about being hung up on one guy. She then says that she has no options, and I say that I'd definitely sleep with her but she seems like a bit of a clinger so she's out of contention. She tells me that I have a sexy accent, but it would be awkward at work. And I tell her that it doesn't matter anyway, because I don't sleep with clingers. (bear in mind this was all said in an incredibly light and teasing tone).

Anyway after that my friend who was talking to her says he wants to go check out this other bar he's a regular at, and tries to get the group to go. Everyone goes except for HB8.5 who tells him she's going to stay here when he asks her to come (she's chatting to a few of her friends). But I jog over to her and say ""HB8.5, we're going to -bar-, let's go!"" and then turn and start to walk away. She says bye to her friends and RUNS after me. 

When we get to the bar my friend pulls her aside for a cigarette, and they're outside talking. I go inside and have a dance with a few people and then she comes up to me about 5 minutes later, and says ""Let's do a ninja escape and run away to -other club- by ourselves"". I agree and we run to other club. When we get there she asks ""So are you going to buy me a drink? I'll get the next round."" I say ""How about you get this round and I'll get the next one"". She agrees and buys me a beer,  we dance a bit, but I'm struggling with KINO and she's not really that into it which confuses me as she responded really well to my KINO at dinner. 

After maybe 20 minutes the rest of the group turn up looking for us, and we all do some group dancing. Then most of them go home. Leaving Me with HB 8.5 HB6 and a HB7. 

They're all dancing with me and each other, and at this point everyone gets a lot more relaxed and kino flows with all of them. HB6 starts kissing me, and I keep pushing her away, and HB7 keeps coming over to me and grinding and dirty dancing with me, and I'm starting to escalate dance kino with HB8.5 but she still seems a bit off. Eventually she says to me ""what's going on with you and HB6? are you together?"" I laugh and tell her that we slept together once, and that it's nothing at all and after that she loosens up a lot. 


The thing that I enjoyed most about this club though was that guys were hitting on these girls left right and centre, and all I would have to do is catch their eye, hold out my arm, and they'd come and be all over me. I stole HB6, HB8.5 and HB7 from dancing with one guy at seperate times with simply a look and a beckon for them to come to me and he was fucking pissed off. I don't know why, but having been the AFC who has lost the girl to guys with game so many times in the past being on the other end of it just felt amazing. 

Anyway we change clubs for the final time and go to this last place where everything really starts to escalate. Me and HB8.5 are really grinding hard and my hands are all over her body and I'm kissing her neck and nibbling her ear, HB6 is trying to kiss me at any chance she gets, and HB7 is always trying to get in and grind up against me any chance she gets, and is literally grabbing my hands and placing them under her top and on her inner thighs. 

Then I go to the bathroom, and come back to find HB6 and HB8.5 making out. I wait for a gap and then go in for the makeout with HB6 and we all start dancing together. HB7 disappears for a bit. But basically it's me and HB8.5 taking turns making out with HB6 and everyone with their hands all over each other. (couldn't get a K close in the club with HB8.5 for some reason)

Anyway it gets to about 5am and we go out for a cigarette, HB8.5 says she can't be bothered going all the way home, and do I have a couch that her and HB6 can top and tail on. I laugh, and say ""Yeah. Hah, a couch. Totally"" She laughs and says that we can all try and squeeze into my bed. And HB7 says she'll sleep on the couch (I find out at this point she has a boyfriend). 

So we basically go and get some food and head home, and all get into bed. It's basically HB6, HB7, and HB8.5 all squeezed together. I really want HB7 out of this situation as I don't do cheating, and tell her she should go into the lounge and find a movie to watch or something cos she's in my spot. She does, and then comes back (something I didn't plan on). And It's me between HB6 and HB8.5 and I have my arms around both of them and I'm making out a little bit with HB6 and feeling up HB8.5 at the same time. HB7 though just won't get the fucking hint. I say ""hmm, there seems to be not much space in the bed, I think it's only really designed for 3 people""..... Nothing.... Then I say ""Hmm, if you'd be more comfortable you can sleep on the couch HB7?"" and she goes ""Or I could just sleep here....""... Me and the other girls are trying so hard not to laugh at the awkwardness of the situation.. but eventually I just say ""OK HB7, If I give you a blanket will you please go and sleep on the couch"". She agrees and leaves and then it's all on. 

HB6 texted me in the morning saying that she loved the threesome and that it was her first one, and that she wants to do it again sober. I was also texting HB8.5 and told her that while lastnight was fun, I'd like to have some time with her by myself. She tells me that she likes threesomes every now and then too but one on one is better, and that we should hang out some time. 

One more thing which was weird as hell but not really relevant to the FR, is that in the morning after HB8.5 left, me and HB6 were in bed watching south park. HB7 comes in and watches with us. Then me and HB6 are making out a bit, and HB6 says to HB7 ""HB7, we're going to fuck now. So...."" Then HB7 goes ""So I guess I have to leave then?"" HB6 goes ""Well you don't have to leave... but.... uhh....."" and HB7 says ""Oh ok, I don't mind staying. I know what sex is"" and then me and HB6 fuck with HB7 sitting in the room watching south park. 

I think HB7 really wanted sex too, but fucking a girl with a boyfriend is a shitty thing to do.

One of my best friends (and my best wingman) and I developed these simple rules while gaming at a club that we were regulars at. I figured I'd post them here to maybe help some of you out,  they seem to be in line with the same school of thought as Seddit.


These rules have to be ingrained in your brain for them to work. They are about having a confident, cocky funny attitude, as well as establishing frame control. I used to get nervous when talking to girls until I really committed to these rules. Next time you're out, try thinking with these.

**1) NEVER give a fuck**: Nothing anyone says affects you. You are in your state and it is not changing. Be who you are and don't be afraid to do or say whatever you see fit. (*Wingman tactics used here: A girl says some snippy, sassy ass comment to you, you reply with a sharp comeback, and your wingman would laugh to lighten the mood and help you establish a playful frame that you and your wingman control.*) A girl rejects you? Don't care, it's unimportant in the end. 
  *i.e. Outcome Independent*

**2) You own the place**: No matter if it's a bar, random house party, or your own place, you need to ALWAYS act as if you are at home, in any environment. Many people clam up in new/different places. You will not. Forcing yourself to feel at home will (in time) give you the comfort to do whatever you want, vastly improving your game. You wouldn't be afraid to talk to someone if they were sitting on your couch, you should treat everywhere you go like that. 
  *i.e. Confidence to approach, using (what will eventually be) natural body language*

**3)Every girl wants you**: You ARE attractive and fun. That girl that just eyed you? Yea, she wants you. That bartender? Her too. It's important that you actually think you can have any girl you set your mind to. Otherwise you're setting false limitations on yourself and will create a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. THAT GIRL IS NOT TOO HOT FOR YOU. So many people, including myself, have gotten freaked out by exceptionally hot woman. Don't treat her any differently than a girl that's so ugly, you wouldn't even take a BJ from her. This makes you the **prize**. She has to work for you, because you have a sea of other options. 
  *i.e. Prizing*




**tl;dr** Don't let anything affect you, act as if you would in your own home, and honestly convince yourself that you have a chance with every and any girl.

I kind of got a late start to the night, so I didn’t make it to the bar area until around 11:30.  However, this happened to be perfect timing because as I’m about to walk in the door I see two of my friends from high school rolling up (one guy, one girl) with two other girls that I don’t know.  So we all head into the bar, and I meet the two girls , and we are all having a good time.

Now because I know my two friends who are with the girls I am able to isolate each of them at separate times to get to know them a little bit, and they aren’t really perceiving me as anyone but a cool guy who knows their friends.  All the while applying heaving kino.  

So fast forward a little bit, and I take the one of the girls by the hand and lead her out to the dance floor where I get the k-close.  Then we go over to the bar to get some drinks.

**This is where the don’t be this guy comes in.**  Some guy who is friends with my girl comes over, and she is really happy to see him, and gives him a hug (this is around 1:15 and he has just come out so that he can give my girl a ride home).  So I introduce myself and play it cool, and talk to him a little bit.  I can immediately tell that this dude is a hardcore AFC.  

So fast forward some more and my two friends, the girl I’m with, AFC, and myself have bounced to another bar.  So AFC goes to the bathroom and I say to my girl, “He really likes you.”  She responded with, “Yeah, I know.  He asked me out while we were on a ski lift together one time, but I really just see him as only a friend. “  A little bit later the bar is closing and I ask her how she is getting home.  She tells me that AFC is going to give her a ride, to which I reply, “No, he doesn’t have to.  I’ll drive you.”  She then turns around to AFC and tells him that I’m going to give her a ride, and she doesn’t need him to.  AFC then just turned, and walked right out the door.  I actually felt pretty bad for him.  

TLDR:  If you want a girl make your move.  Stop being passive with shit you care about because otherwise someone else is gonna swoop in.

i'd been crushing on this girl for close to 2 years since we first met.  *and she knew it too*.  i asked her out a while ago but she just kinda just laughed it off.  it was a huge blow to my ego and let myself get Friend-zoned like a mofo.  

we have the same group of friends and go to the same school, so i saw her often.  whenever we all would go out or whenever i was around her, i was the classic Beta:  super nice, available at her every beck and call, and holding out hope that one-day she would reconsider my offer for a date.  basically, i let her take advantage of my feelings for her.

over the last 2 years, i never actually saw her with another guy but i'm not that naive to think that she hasn't been with any guy either (HB8 latina w/ smokin hot body).  it wasn't until last month when our group of friends were out at a party when i saw her making out with another guy.  it nearly ruined my night but luckily it was roughly the same time i found /r/seduction.  i had learned to shrug it off, ignore her, and kept on having fun. no sense in letting something out of control get the best of me

i carried this mentality over to monday when we came back for school.  ignored her.  didn't talk to her.  not so much as look at her either.  when she tried talkin to me, i'd be brief and walk away.  i realized how much better off i was doing this and have kept this up for the last month.  i got rid of my beta tendencies.

we were still friends, but i was no longer available to her like i was the past 2 years.  she wasn't getting the attention from me that she was use to getting and it started to bother her.  earlier last week, she came up to me and asked why i was ignoring her.  and i responded the same way i had been all month.  i just said, ""no i'm not"" and just walked away.  steadily, she'd been trying to get my attention more and more everyday.

it all culminated to this past weekend when we all went out as a group for the first time since the party to an all day outdoor concert.  i went about doing my own thing like usual:  ignoring her and just having fun.  but as the day went on, she started getting closer and closer to me.  escalating kino and throwing iois at me (grabbing my butt, holding my hand, etc)  

i push-pulled her.  we'd be walking and holding hands for a bit but then i'd just toss her hand aside to go talk to a random group of chicks just to let her know that i have other options.

by the end of the day, she was sitting on my lap with her arms all around me.  she asked me again why i'd been ignoring her all month.  i didn't say a word and just k-closed her.

not much but its def a great start.  i got more done in one month with an alpha mentality than in 2 years as a beta.

**TL;DR - don't be a chump and NEVER be too available to a girl.**

&gt; Confidence. Maaaaaybe not a 'little thing', but looking good can be half the battle if you aren't willing to carry it home. Looks from girls? Cool. Actually turning those looks into something? Success. Seriously, if someone checks you out, go capitalize on it. Know who is a well dressed alpha male? James Bond.

[darthluke](http://reddit.com/user/darthluke) replies:

&gt; Show me the ways of the Jedi. It is great to imagine myself doing this, and another thing entirely to actually do it, especially if you get looks from girls but you doubt whether they think you actually look hot, or just way too dressed up.

Well, /r/malefashionadvice wasn't exactly the place to continue the conversation, so here's my guide to not being a spineless sucker:

This one's actually fuckin' easy. I'll admit, I look like a frumpy-motherfuckin'-engineer (why I'm here, right?), but I nailed the confidence thing a long time ago -- perhaps in the nerdiest way.

I was hanging with my buddy and his girlfriend playing video games, and she's talking about how I should ask out her friend. I'm all ""nah, I wouldn't feel comfortable I don't know her well enough and..."": classic loser litany. She responds with: ""You know, the worst she can say is 'no'"", and as I begin to retort with: ""but what if she doe..."" she stops me with: ""Listen, you sit here and die in this game like 38 times in a row trying to achieve the most menial goal, and no one judges you for failing until you get it right.""

And then it all clicked -- Confidence was an achievement that needed unlocking and I had to grind it 'til it was owned.

So, practice this regimen (not just for getting the ladies):

* When walking down the street, you're the CEO and everyone else are measly mail-room workers, but you're a benevolent motherfucker, so when you see someone interesting you just smile and say ""Hello. How is your day treating you?"". After less than 5 sentences of chit-chat (or none at all), dismiss yourself.
* Phase 2: compliments -- See a hot girl (or some dude you feel out-alpha'd by)? Stroll right on up and give them a ""Hey, how's it going? That's an awesome skirt/belt/purse, where'd you get it?"" or ""Hey fella, you look slick, did you find those shoes from reading /r/malefashionadvice?"". Now you've actually engaged in conversation with a hot girl but to make it a no-fret no strings attached confidence builder, there's an important step: dismiss yourself and walk away!
* Phase 3: Go to a bar/party/sports event alone, find a girl, and strike up a conversation about whatever you find is interesting: sports, reruns of Dick van Dyke, sci-fi novels, doesn't fucking matter. If she isn't interested it doesn't matter, because you're going to be polite and dismiss yourself and walk away after a maximum of 10 minutes conversing.

Essentially, practice walking up to random people and being one nice motherfucker without preconceptions and no strings until you're comfortable at it, then move up to the next level of engagement. Don't try to beat the final boss until you beat the previous stages.

10 years of practice later I can walk my barely-kempt ass up to any lady and make her feel like a fuckin' queen (for AT LEAST 5 minutes ;) )",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_livhj,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/livhj/sleepynates_guide_to_unlocking_the_achievement_of/,

Honestly, if you're on a woman's radar before approach, it's because she has a strong opinion about how you look, how you conduct yourself in public, or what she's heard about you. When this opinion is positive, that's when you end up with that field report where there was nothing you could possibly do wrong.

When it's negative... well, you'll know when it's negative (abort! abort!). You get the cold shoulder, polite and yet unenthusiastic response. Or impolite and also enthusiastic. Essentially, you learn about the ""Art of No"" in these interactions.

Either way, most women are not paying attention to you when you enter the room - unless you did it in an especially flamboyant way, like being admitted VIP to a club, or pulling up in a really nice car that's worth more than their house, or being a celebrity... but that's another conversation for another day.

You do not exist in her world, until you're standing in front of her.

That said, get this into your head, especially if you thought women weren't visual creatures:

**A woman is able to make a decision within the first minute about whether she's going to give you a chance. Sometimes even less that that.**

""Not visual."" Hah. True, in the sense that they don't obsess over male aesthetic as vice versa.

However, they can tell a lot of things about you by looking at you. If they see you approach, they already have an idea of whether you're passably confident, or pissing in your pants.

So, when you approach, don't sabotage yourself with body language that second guesses (slouching, walking up, pausing, continuing - a big no-no). Speak clearly. Be polite, but stand closer than you would with a platonic friend. Smell nice. Also, you better be dressed well for your environment - handle that shit. Having some chill friends around, or at least knowing the bartender is a big plus.

Since your social resumé isn't something that you can realistically write down and hand to someone while expecting a response in good faith, you need to make sure that you're showing it off visibly and verbally.

Pass that first minute with a positive impression (way easier said than done, obviously), and everything else is comparatively easy. Your escalations will be met in kind, and the girl will be rooting for you. Why wouldn't she? She has a positive first impression of you.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_1h41oj,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1h41oj/why_first_impressions_are_so_important/,

It's anonymous, so they will never know if you liked them or denied them unless they liked you as well, in which case it matches you up and you can start chatting. I have it on my iphone, not sure if it is compatible with other phones.

First of all, I like it because it cuts to the chase. There's no reason to feel self-conscious talking to a girl because she already thinks you are hot. Sometimes a girl you know will pop up, so it completely eliminates the question of whether she is attracted to you or not. And it works pretty well, I've hooked up with one of the girls I was matched with, and a friend of mine fucked two.

I think the biggest value in it is the practice you get for texting girls. You can try different strategies, different persona's (cocky funny, romantic, goofy, nice guy, jerk, etc.), specific texts that you are unsure will work, and just see how the girls react. You can really push the limit because you don't know the girl and probably won't meet her anyway.

1323878655.0,167,self.seduction,nchdo,"Do it all, and win.",206,39,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/nchdo/do_it_all_and_win/,"I just read a post called ""An Authentic Man"".  Thanks to Karaktor for the inspiration.  I agree with a lot of things he said.  Authenticity seems like a universally human goal, something worth working towards.  Saying this, I've got some of my own thoughts:

Life is work first, play second.  If you want the results, you have to be prepared to work hard.  Every day, you have to work to complete all the things you expect of yourself.  Each little thing you complete gives you a tiny bit of self-respect.  Each thing you neglect without good reason takes away a tiny bit of self respect.  And I’ve found self-respect is highly related to self-love.  Once you’ve worked, take time to play, have fun, etc- at this point you’ve earned it.   

Work isn’t solely your job, or school work.  Oftentimes it's just the small things.  It’s includes wash, and keeping your room/house/car clean.  Working out, keeping up with personal hygiene.  Then there are larger things after that, going to school, forwarding your career, etc.  

I've gained a lot of my confidence from reading ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" and putting them into action.  One of the main points is private victories precede public victories.  I think these directly parallel inner game and outer game.  When you have the discipline and willpower to attain self-control, you can start winning privately.  

For example, I know I want to be an attractive guy; moreover, a good-hearted, successful person.  In the past, fun gave me happiness.  I knew I needed to focus on my future, but I wanted instant gratification, and would trade time I could spend to better myself to play videogames or watch TV.  I had fun for a while doing this, but in the last few years, it's left me feeling more and more empty.

Now I know this- I like fun and entertainment, but it doesn't give me *fulfillment*.  Do I LOVE doing laundry, cleaning my house and cooking meals for later in the week?  No, not really.  But when these things are done, I feel fulfilled, and ready for anything that comes my way- friends coming in to town, a girl coming over, even unrelated things like my productivity at work.  Once I've had these small, private victories, I'm confident I can win in the outside world as well.

A lot of the stuff on the inner game sidebar is very useful information, but I don’t think it’s the first step.  The truth is, if you can't handle making the commitment to yourself to be what you want when you're alone, you won't be able to be what you want socially either.  It’s like a hidden prerequisite to the prerequisite.  To gain REAL, inner confidence, you have to be ALL the things you want to be.  You have to move toward being a complete person whose qualities support each other, and then you'll be able to do anything.  But even before that, you have to be READY.

I've heard it described as ""your home is your kingdom"".  To me, this is so true.  What I know is, the amount of work I have to do will be the same or less if I'm proactive and handle the things I need to handle, NOW.  If I wait until later, the work will only compile and intimidate me into submission.

I think a lot of us are in, or have been in, a situation where you don't know what you have until it’s gone.  We’ve all had days or weeks of intense motivation only to let it all go at some point, to have a day where we can slack off and do nothing.  Then we never get back on our game.  We wonder why we feel bad, and in this negative state, we look toward extrinsic things to make us happy.  Mine were weed and videogames, what the fuck do you know?  And I wondered why I wasn't happy, assuring myself that getting the little things in order *couldn’t* really bring me back to the level I once was at.  The problem was that I was looking at each thing individually, not recognizing that they are meant to work together.  I now know, when you do ALL THE THINGS, a synergy develops that keeps you going.  You begin to believe that you CAN be everything you want to be.  And belief is the most important step.  “Fake it till you make it” might work on singular aspects of life, and is great for developing a certain attitude outwardly.  I tried this, and it was tough for me.  I could never keep up an attitude without having the real character traits and habits behind it.  So now I work, get confidence, and trade up.  Use a small amount of confidence to step out of my comfort zone, learn and gain more confidence to take that bigger step next time.  And in the background, I’m making a habit of trying new things, having fun, and LIVING.

I know I'm reiterating, but the little things we do each day are so important.  When you expect yourself to do something; when you really WANT to do something, but you don't because you're lazy or have other bullshit reasons, it can start a chain reaction.  When you say fuck it to one thing, at that moment, you're basically saying fuck it to your entire life; you're saying you can’t handle it.  A quote that sticks with me: ""If you can't handle the dishes, how do you expect to handle running a fortune 500 company?""

Self-control is so god damn important.  It saves you from those moments of want, want, want that can send you crashing to the ground.

Forgive me if this isn't that cohesive.  I hope I got my point across.  

**TL;DR** Win over yourself before trying to win over others.  Work hard each day, and gain respect for yourself, then play.  Be everything you want be, down to the seemingly insignificant actions, and feel fulfilled.

--------
**Edit:**  It seems some people might believe that I'm saying ""achieve to build confidence.""  This is almost correct.  My point actually is,  do what you expect of yourself.

I was always that shy, nerdy, socially awkward kid growing up. Never had a girlfriend, never even had sex without paying for it. The sad thing is that I'm a really good-looking guy and I'm in great shape... but I was always too scared to approach or I just had the worst luck in general. Girls would approach me or show interest and I could never score a touchdown.

A few years ago I found The Game by Strauss and eventually Seddit. After college and so many near-girlfriends and blown opportunities to hookup, I decided it was time for a change. I started to realize my personality was creeping out girls or I was being too much of a nice guy.

So after a year of a lot of trial and error and slowly improving my lifestyle, my personality, my circle of friends, my wardrobe, my car, and my game I finally had a girl who I could call my girlfriend. I finally had sex. I finally had someone crazy about me. She was pretty, tall, great T&amp;A, great in bed, smart and funny. But yesterday, right before New Years, she broke up with me.

This past week was leading up to it. As soon as I got a girlfriend, I turned the game off. I became my old, needy, clingy, creepy self. Maybe the real me?

She said I did too much PDA, was too possessive, too clingy, and too needy. She said she wasn't the right girl for me. It crushed me a lot, especially for it to happen now around the holidays.

It sucks we only lasted a few months but I regret nothing. Thanks to this subreddit I learned so much. I honestly thought I'd never need you guys again so I deleted my account, deleted all my bookmarks, sold my books. Now I realize I'm not consistent. I still need help. This whole experience really humbled me and taught me a lot.

There's a lot of stuff here on how to get a girlfriend but maybe not enough on how to keep one. There's a bit of pessimism in this subreddit too from me just looking around today, but you guys have really helped me. I still recognize a lot of names here too.

I don't even know why I'm posting this or what else to say. I just needed to vent too... sorry if this is the wrong place but I feel like Seddit deserves some thanks.

I wanted to share my story about this. To some if not most here, this whole gaming, techniques and bunch of advice isn't only to get girls to like you or into your bed, but also to become a better person. More confident, open, social, whatever you're striking for. Self-improvement at its finest. 

So you managed to step up to your AA and got that girl's number? Great. Got a date? Even better. Made her your girlfriend? Wow, couldn't have done it better, right? Right, but here it comes. **Do not settle down, think you've done your part and everything is butterflies from now on.**

Over a year ago, I was your average AFC. I don't have to draw it to you, but I was bad. One day I was sitting next to this girl in this lesson we had together, and it all snapped in my head. I wanted her. I wasn't going to let her go away like I did with all the past ones. I decided to step up to my AA and went on reddit to get some advice, and found out about seddit. I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/kzr62/i_know_i_should_go_for_her_but_how_ive_got_3_days/). It's kind of funny to look back on it now.

One approach, one success. I got her number, I got her to hang out with me. I read and read seddit, late into the night, and practised my game on her. Turns out she had a boyfriend, shit I told myself at first. Fuck it I told myself at second. I didn't give two fucks, didn't develop oneitis and went on with my awesome life. Thing is, when I talked to her about other girls, she would get kind of jealous. I noticed her flirting with me every now and then aswell. I was at loss here, this couldn't be, she had a boyfriend! Turns out he was an ass. Two months later, after more gaming and more developing, I went for it and we kissed. Out of the friendzone. It worked. My mind was blown. She dumped him that night. Boom, there we go and off we went to have an awesome relationship. Over the next weeks and months she told me she's never been happier before, and all the romantic things that you can think of. It was awesome, until I sank in a depression because of my insecurities and low self-esteem. 

Here's why: as soon as I got in this relationship, I stopped reading this subreddit. At the time I figured ""what the fuck am I still doing here?"", because well, my techniques worked and I had that girl with long-term potential. I wasn't looking for anything else so why keep on with the game? And that's when all my AFC shit crawled back up at me. I got jealous, I got insecure, I was a wreck. I was, as I like to call it, a little beta bitch. I often would break up in tears over insignificant shit, because I was making such a big deal out of everything. I wasn't secure about my actions and my decisions. I almost lost her because of this. We've talked things through, and she clearly told me that she was thinking of breaking up because of how I turned out. I read seddit again since two weeks and feel better than ever.

But I'm not here to rant about my relationship.

Guys. Even if you're just looking to get one girl and are not into gaming every Friday night, you've got to keep it on, especially if you were an AFC before. Don't be afraid to pull tricks on your girlfriend. If she thinks you're weird, then she's not for you. Approach just for the sake of meeting people and being friends! Be cool, be awesome, be confident and never take her for granted. Make sure you don't do the same mistake as me and think that you're good now and don't have to game anymore, because you will lose here if you get back to being an AFC. Here's a [good guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/tlorg/my_relationship_manifesto_what_to_do_after_you/) about it by the way.

Had another awesome night last night. Our band managed to get together for the first jam session in ages and we picked up right where we left off. Then I had a nice speedy same night lay. Feelsgoodman.jpg

After the session, TheEngDude and I head to one of our usual bars for drinks. The place is pretty dead, so we shoot the shit, drink some whiskey and beer and get ready to leave. We're hungry so we head up to the late night pizza place up the block.

---

**TIME: 12:30AM**

We're eating our pizza when a young 2-set of HB7s sits down next to us. One is white and one is mixed black/white - so hot with a smokin' body. I immediately open them, asking them if they know the song that has been stuck in my head for three days now. (Seriously, someone help me out! It's some 70s funk song with the lyrics ""Into the night... into the night!"" I think).

They have no idea, but they're fun to banter with. We shoot the shit for a bit and the set is generally going well. At one point these two other good-looking dudes come in and sit down at the table next to them. 

Wanting to cut off the competition before it happens, I say ""Ladies, check out these guys. Pretty hot, huh? etc etc."" Basically a mix of cocky/funny to establish an alpha frame.

We get into an argument about who can eat their pizza slices the fastest. The girls bet us a dollar. We lost but it created an inside joke we could reference back the rest of the night. (**Guys, this is always useful for ""bringing her back to the moment""**)

---

**TIME: 1:00AM**

We bounce them to another one of our regular bars. On the walk there, I see TheEngDude is already holding hands with his girl. Excellent :)

We sit in a booth, sip some beer and kino the hell out of them. We stay till last call. TheEngDude walks his girl to the exit. My girl is lingering in the booth so I come back, grab her and BOOM - make out. I wanted to get the makeout in to ease the tension before we exited the bar and had to decide what to do next.

The girls say they need to go back to the place they're crashing. But one of them said ""But... you can walk us back."" (**Guys, any time a girl does this, it's a HUGE IOI. She's basically giving you an invitation to bang. All you have to do is not fuck it up.**)

We get in front of their place and ask if we can go in. ""Nope, it's our friend's apartment.""

Then TheEngDude has a stroke of brilliance... He says, ""Let's go to my place and keep partying. I'll call my personal driver."" He then proceeds to order an Uber cab.

The girls don't believe his ""personal driver"" story. Like a boss he says, ""Just watch. Any minute now a black car will pull up.""

And boom - it did. The girls hop in and we get to his place.

---

**TIME: 2:15AM**

The girls go into his bathroom together. I give TheEngDude a fist bump and tell him I'm gonna isolate my girl when she comes out.

I take my girl into the guest bedroom. He takes his girl into his room. BOOM. Caveman in. We have hot sex for an hour and a half.

My favorite part was that we could hear his girl moaning from his room through the wall. This turned my girl on so much, so she'd get into it more and yell even louder. The whole thing was like a snowball effect.

I tried to see if the girls would hook up with each other, but alas, they weren't into that. Oh well.

So this is an FR that takes place over the span of a little more than a month. If any of you had read my latest FR, it's about the same girl. It's a french girl I had met at a party my friend was throwing and I think this is a perfect case to inspire some of you, because things between me and her went from really cold, to really hot. I'm going to pick this up where my last FR left off, let's dig in!

So, as some of you might know me and the girl had exchanged a small kiss at the party and I really wanted to see her again (alone), so later that week, after having chilled 1 or 2 more times among friends, I sent her a message on FB asking her if she'd like to grab some drinks. Result? She never answered me. **Fuck**. So what did I do? I simply organized a night out with my friends on the day I wanted to go with her, and on that very day she sent me a message and tagged along with us.

Now this is where it gets messy. Fast forward a few days or so and we're all at a bar having some drinks. She mentions going up to Montreal the next day cause she has to check out some appartments, I mention I have my day free and bam we organize a day out in the city. 

So I made her visit a couple of things, we went to the observatory on the olympic stadium (pretty awesome) and had a good time. She had to visit an appartment around 5 so we drove back downtown, and here's where my heart stopped. As I park the car, I turn to her and touch her arm and say ""come closer"" as I myself inch a little closer.

**She looks at me, says ""what are you doing?"" laughs, and gets out of the car**.

FUCK. Complete and total door slam right in my face. I got out of the car and (thanks to seddit) *did not* apologize and instead said I didn't want to make her uncomfortable and that I simply felt like doing that in the moment. She says ""well, you made me uncomfortable"" and we move on from there. Rest of the day was actually decent, but I was pretty bummed nonetheless.

After this event, I actually felt good because my intentions were perfectly clear and there wasn't going to be any misunderstanding. So I let things flow from there and let her breathe, I just acted fucking normal lol, like my usual self. It actually felt like nothing had happened after a while and we were back on square one, fresh start.

We went to go see a concert together (the xx and grizzly bear down by canal lachine), I helped her move to her new appartment in Montreal... etc. We did many things together and we became pretty damn close. 

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

At this point I was terribly afraid of falling in the friendzone, but I kept being sexual, teasing, a lot of kino, etc. I was sitting on a fucking fence. I was thinking ""why does she spend so much time with me but shut me down? She must only see me as a friend.."" Nonetheless I kept it up and made my intentions as clear as possible, I felt like we were getting closer to one another.

She eventually starts being much more open and fun via texting (she was always ridiculously distant) and I took that as a good sign. 

**DISCLAIMER**

Keep texting minimal!!! I never never never texted her for no reason or ""just to chat."" I was always planning something and from THERE we'd have a brief conversation. DON'T BE A NEEDY CHUMP.

On the 23rd, the eve of the Saint-Jean holiday here in Quebec, my friend threw a party where we could all sleep over and she came along, but couldn't sleep over because she had work at 7 the next morning.

Guys, this was the first time in A MONTH where I could ALMOST be 100% sure by saying ""she wants me"". I was in the dark the whole fucking time, I had oneitis and was going fucking crazy over the mixed signals. But at this party, she threw on *heavy* kino, especially when I was wearing only my bathing suit.

Eventually she had to leave and we said bye, and I felt like shit because I felt like I should've accompanied her to the bus stop. 

She texted me a few minutes after leaving, and I cracked a joke saying ""don't forget your pepper spray!"" 

she responded with ""hey it's your fault if something happens, I know deep inside you sent me that message because you feel bad about yourself""

And then I said something like ""yeah.. I should've accompanied you to the bus stop huh..? This place is pretty dangerous.""

**GOLDEN RESPONSE**

She says: ""Yeah, you should of..""

NOW we have something! I was pretty fucking excited, and on tuesday she texted me to do something thursday, friday and saturday, lol! I went to her place with my friend and his girlfriend on thursday to have supper, which was cool, and on friday (yesterday) we met up at the jazzfest in montreal. This is where the fun is!

**CLOSING**

So I drove up with my buddy to the jazzfest to meet her and 2 of her friends. Early on in the day she mentioned we could sleep over at her appartment if we'd drink too much. We leave jazzfest around midnight and head over to a bar nearby. This whole time she was being VERY touchy, much more than usual. I knew something was going to go down. We sit down, me next to her and my friend next to her friend (one of them had left). And our legs were touching. After a while, I nonchalanty place my hand on her knee under the table while talking with the others and leave it there. Eventually I take it off and she comes and grabs my hand in hers (YES!!!). The whole night, we kept touching under the table, scratching our legs, touching hands, etc. Until my friend and her friend got up to go to the bathroom. We talked for like 20 seconds and then I pulled her in for a long, intense makeout..

After that, we simply got to her appartment the 4 of us, and well, the rest is history!

At this point I should probably stress that I do have friends, they just don't like to travel that much. I on the other hand, LOVE to travel and I had a great opportunity that I just couldn't miss out on, even if that meant traveling alone. 


So, how does this fit on seddit, I hear you ask? Simple. I am your average guy. I am not alpha, I don't look like a model, I still have a problem talking and approaching girls. At times I think I am my own worst enemy because I just care too much about everything. But on this trip I decided to just not give a flying fuck. I was 1000 miles from home, nobody knew me and they never ever see me again, if I don't want them to. 


The first night I said to myself that I'm just going to see what's going on at this bar where I'm staying. There were these two guys that seemed confident, looked quite good and going to the same bar. Rather than going alone, I engage in a conversation and we end up sitting together at that bar. Soon enough we joined a group of girls that were there and things just got better from then on. I got to know few more guys and girls that were staying there and I actually hit it off with this girl that was leaving the next day. I haven't got further than k-close, but I am feeling pretty good. 


The second night was kinda the same thing, but I got lucky on the third. I went to the bar alone and when I got there, I knew half the guys. We play pool for a while when I see this girl just sitting on a couch, bored out of her mind looking around the bar. We make short eye contact and million things ran through my mind at this moment. At first I hesitated a bit but then I just decided to not care how badly I fail with this chick, so I go talk to her. I spent talking with her so long that they closed the bar down and we went to my room to have some more fun. 


My point here is not to brag how good am I with hitting on girls. It really isn't. Because back at home I am really terrible with talking to girls most of the time. My point is that if you're traveling alone, you can be whoever you want, you don't need to give 2 shits about anybody and just do whatever. It's also so much easier talking to girls. You have million and one great conversation starters at your disposal. 

TL;DR go on a solo trip and meet some girls. Don't give a fuck, just do whatever you want!",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_18mux9,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/18mux9/why_solo_travel_can_and_will_help_you/,

I had an awesome night of epic lulz with a couple of my /r/BayAreaSeddit brothers.

We begin the night at a networking event near my office. A couple girls Jewiger and I met on St. Paddy's Day invited us. It was meh, so we decide to get in a cab and head out.

We get to a bar that has happy hour till 10PM. It's 9:40, so we slam drinks for 20 minutes. I get #-closed by a drunk guy at the bar while the other BAS guys hit on the random girls there.

We move to our planned destination... A bar that's always packed with young college girls on Tuesdays. After a few blow-outs and so-so sets, we're all in state and ready to do it big time.

**[The ""He's Not Coming""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trEMHjNYq6I)**

We walk across the street to another bar. I see two girls standing outside waiting for something... I approach immediately.

&gt; TofuTofu: *as I put my arm around her and make a look of pity* He's not coming...

&gt; HB: Who's not coming?

&gt; TofuTofu: That guy you're waiting for...

&gt; HB: LOL are you a pickup artist?

&gt; TofuTofu: Yes, but not a very good one. I forgot my fuzzy hat and eyeliner...

&gt; HB: Yeah, and you're supposed to ignore me and talk to my friend first if you want to hit on me.

&gt; TofuTofu: Who says you're my target? *trollface*

**(Guys, it's so important to be SELF-ENTERTAINED when you're in the field. Girls can pick up when someone is not taking themselves too seriously and having a great time. It's infectious and makes men/women want to spend time with you. It's the very definition of being a value giver - bringing the party.)**

So she laughs and moves inside to the bar with 3 girlfriends. I move in, engage them, and put my hand on my target's waist. All 3 girls were in bitchy ""ZOMG HOW DARE YOU TAKE HER FROM US"" mode. I just keep my solid game up, strong eye contact, etc... My target girl-codes ""I got this"" to them and they leave.

We sit at the bar and I move my barstool as close to hers as possible. I make sure our legs are touching, my hand stays on the small of her back, and keep strong eye contact. She eats it up.

Every few minutes her friends would come check on her and she'd girl code to them that she was just fine.

Turns out she's from Belarus and that I have a thing for Eastern European girls. I dig the accent and the look. We build some deep rapport and it becomes blatantly clear that we're really into one another.

I pull out my phone...

&gt; TofuTofu: Let's get this out of the way.

&gt; HB: Oh, the number exchange? Hah, look at you - so confident.

&gt; TofuTofu: I know, I learned it from The Game.

&gt; HB: LOL. *grabs my phone and puts it in herself*

**(Guys, this is called a call-back. We created a connection - a moment - with the pickup artist jokes during the opener. Now I can call back to this and bring her back to that state of ""Wow this guy is pretty awesome"" emotions that she felt earlier. Classic David Wygant right there.)**

We talk some more and then kiss a little bit. I name drop this new place that I've been meaning to check out. She says she also wants to go, so we set up a day-2.

**(Guys, if you can set up a day-2 during the first meeting, you'll dramatically lower your flake rate from numbers. Keep that in mind.)**

At this point her three friends are standing outside, watching us through the window. I point this out to her.

&gt; HB: Hah they're gonna grill me so hard about you.

&gt; TofuTofu: Heh, have fun stepping into the lion's den.

I let her go and then go back to find the BAS guys. Eventually we hopped a cab over to a party for HB-Pornstar's roommate. It was pretty dead but I had fun and #-closed an awesome lesbian and smoked up with a Rastafarian.

",218,55,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/og1wm/fr_god_mode_unlocked_beating_the_10_year/,"I feel fucking fantastic reddit. The biggest regret I have in my life has been released.  A decade of wondering and speculaction converge into reality.

How bad was it? It was the girl I mentioned [in this post.](http://redd.it/k7y2h) High school best friends. Slept over, spooned
through movies, never kissed. I would estimate 90% of all my conversations in
senior year **took place in my head** with her, saying the same things over
and over but never actually pulling the trigger. Dark Oneitis.

She was nearly married from 5yr+ relationship before backing out last minute.
This is first time we've both been single since highschool. First chance in 10yr to speak my mind and possible fix my biggest shortcoming relationship-wise. We've been distant for few years. I invite myself
over to her place, I believe she knows my motives.

What were my motives? To just be fucking honest with her and myself. To either have her reject me or finally be with me.
***
## The act
This was both the easiest and hardest thing to do. It was easy because there
were no tactics or logistics needed, all I had to do was just speak my mind.
It was hard because that is exactly what I couldn't bring myself to do for **years.**

Other people are constantly around, I want to confirm logistics, while they are out of the room I tell her:

* **""So you need to sneak away at the end of the night, we need to talk""**
* ""About what?"" - This was my first opportunity to wuss out.
* **""You know.""**
* ""About us."" - Of course she knows
* **""This is the first time we've both been single in a decade. Forget relationships and emotions and everything else, I think we should kiss. I'm curious, you're curious, we should just see""**
* ""Well I think that is a bad idea"" - She means this, but she still wants to. She wants to explore a bad idea.

We are interrupted, the night goes on. Later, everyone else has passed out in
a different room. We sit next to each other, she knows what is going to happen
and wants it to. I take her hand, she's anticipating it, I pull her in close and we kiss. It was everything you could expect for a decade of waiting. Rest is history, I was my normal sexual direct self.
***
There was plenty of fallout from this, which really isn't important because the point is that I spoke my mind and made a move. 

###Key points:

* Held frame when bringing up topic, be direct without beating around the bush
* Leave all complicated stuff like relationships out of it, make it simply about a kiss
* Mindset is I'm happy either way, but I know we are both curious so why not try it

**It is *NEVER* too late.** Don't wait a decade. Do it today.

Ask Me Anything!
***
**Edit #1:**
## Outcome Independence

I didn't expect her to lead to a relationship or even for us to kiss. I just expected to put it out there in as attractive a package as possible. This is key to why it went smoothly. Any expectations would have ruined this. So it doesn't matter where this led to, it was all about that night.

I'm a 21 year old college student and I've never had a girlfriend, never asked a girl out on a date, never asked a girl to a high school dance, and obviously have never been laid as a result of this perpetual timidity. I am a textbook ""friend zone"" guy that clings onto girls that like hanging out with me whom have zero intention of intimacy. This time, I didn't let that happen.

I met a girl at my part-time job, thought she was awesome and thought there were reciprocated feelings from the dynamics of our conversations. Decided that this time, I won't let her throw me in that dreaded friend zone. So after about a week of hyping myself up to do it, I asked her out to a traditional dinner date, just like I promised myself that I would. She turned me down, however, with the hackneyed responses including ""I just got out of a bad relationship"" (though I won't discredit its possibility) and the usual, well-intentioned ""you're a really cool guy, though."" I accepted the response politely and maturely, saying that I would be OK with being friends and appreciated the honesty.

Though I can't say that it didn't suck, considering it was the first time I grew the nuts to say how I felt about a girl to her face before having my dreams crushed on the spot. BUT GOD DAMN IF I DIDN'T TRY. This story may seem anticlimactic, but there's a certain relief that I can't say I've ever experienced in my young life. No longer do I have that question of ""what if?"" or ""if I had just?"" I forever know that she isn't the one, and never was meant to be.

The reason I'm posting this is mostly because I'm too embarrassed to talk about it with my friends as they all have had girlfriends long before me and would probably just pity me (when that's the worst thing for your self-confidence). But I share with you with the reddit anonymity a story that I am more proud of than ashamed, and feel that it might inspire those who've had the same problem as me to go out and ASK THEM OUT GOD DAMMIT. You either win, or learn that you're after the wrong girl. Either way, you need to do it.

TL;DR I asked a girl out, got rejected, felt good that I finally did it anyway.

Thanks for reading! Seize the day, fellow Sedditors!

EDIT: Awesome amount of feedback, you guys are the best! Every comment was read and will continue to be read with the utmost respect and consideration towards a better skill set with the ladies. Main lessons I've learned from you guys that I'll run with so far:

1. No serious date right off the bat, like the mentioned dinner date, especially at my age.
2. Don't immediately discredit her as ""not being the one,"" as that is looking into it too deeply when it was a simple situational error that is wholly my fault when it came to technique and timing.
3. Not a good idea to immediately accept friendship, and I probably lied when I said I would be OK with being so, and you guys properly called me out on that.

To me, confidence and saying, ""Fuck it,"" are related but slightly different.

Confidence is kniwing what you have to offer. Sometimes, we just don't know what we have to offer. That takes experience. We learn what we have and do not have to offer based on our successes and failures. Once again, this takes experience which means it takes time. What do we do until then?

Say, ""Fuck it."" 'Fuck it' is the attitude one takes upon making a choice. You can choose to stand against the wall or you can choose to talk to a girl (or anyone for that matter). Sure, you don't know this person, what they like, or what they're looking for, and there is a good chance that you aren't it. But part of saying, ""Fuck it"" is realizing that you don't have anything **to lose.** 

Nothing to lose. 

Its all about how much you care, which should be enough to not cause the person extreme discomfort or physical harm. 

As a small example: I took a girl out once and grabbed her hand. She commented that now it doesn't appear that I'm selling her (a comment about how she was dressed). I replied that instead it appears that I've purchased her. I almost didn't make that joke. But I just said, ""Fuck it.""

It's really more about making the conscious decision of judging her over how she's judging you, and turning it into a subconscious, instinctual act.

You said your issue is with ""transitioning"", and that could mean a lot of things, but I'm going to take it as meaning that you're having issues closing. If you wanted to read up more on it, qualification is an easy way to transition into closing.

A good example to isolate would be saying something like, ""You know, you strike me as someone who's really spontaneous and adventurous, I really love that about you."" Normally she'll thank you or be flattered, whatever, so you follow up with, ""Hey, you know what would be really fun, we should go for a walk down the boulevard/to the park across the street/etc.""

If you wanted to close rather than isolate, you could say the first bit and follow up with, ""I love talking to you. Before I go, how about we exchange numbers so we can keep in touch?"" Lyons also stated in another of his videos that grounding your suggestions with reality is important, otherwise she's not going to have anything to grab onto (""Why's he wanting me to give him my number?"").

Adam Lyons (is it Lyon or Lyons?) also has a [three part](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djfh1UDvsBk) video [series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOXNh_w02NY&amp;feature=related) on [qualification](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87Cj9lii9IU&amp;feature=related) that might also help.

They’re wrong.

Of course, they don’t want you to be someone you’re not or be fake, so they tell you, “just be yourself”. They say “people should love you for you”. But, they’re missing the real point. I’m going to say it point blank: the you isn’t good enough right now. You’ve “been yourself” for your entire life. How far has that gotten you with women? Go ahead and answer that question quietly to yourself. My guess is the answer is, not too far. The real advice here is:

Be your best self.

If you want to improve with women and your social life you must think about the overall picture. Make a list at all the areas that you believe need improvement. You know better than anyone else what you’re good at and what you’re not. Here’s a great place to start:

**Humor**
Women love men that are funny. Do you make people laugh? Can you take a joke?

**Health**
Are you obese or underweight? Do you have good breathe?

**Fashion**
Do you dress well? Do you look good at work and when you go out on the town?

**Travel/Culture**
Are you cultured? Have you been out of your hometown? Are you open minded?

**Fears**
Do you face them? Are you always paranoid? Do you take chances?

**Hobbies/Skills**
Do you have them? Are you working on getting them?

**Solid body language**
Do you slouch? Do you look people in the eye when you talk to them?

**Conversation skills**
Can you hold a conversation? How are you at talking with strangers on a daily basis?

**Passions**
Do you have them? Do you work at them?

Constantly work at these goals. Those are the ways you can better yourself and begin to become attractive. This isn’t being fake. This isn’t changing who you are as a person. You are bettering yourself one step at a time.

This past weekend, I was at a bar two of my mates. HB8 comes over to my group and says:

""Buy my friend a drink. She is getting married""! 

My two friends fell silent. As I casually responded. 

""That's the exact reason why I shouldn't buy her one. But are you single?""

HB8 ""no, I have a boyfriend. But I really want you to buy my friend a drink!""

I wrap my arm around her and say ""I really want you to give me a blowjob but neither of those things are going to happen tonight!""

My two friends burst out laughing. She blushed and said that she was getting one of her single friends for me. At that point, I moved on and starting chatting up this tasty blonde thing across the bar. 

It made me realize that girls are no different than panhandlers. They look at you and expect you to give them something. Have you ever watched a panhandler ask you for money? As soon as you say that you don't have cash, a light switch goes off and you become invisible.

This has been my philosophy for over a year. I don't buy girls drinks because girls don't buy drinks for me. The end results is that it splits girls in to two categories: Golddiggers and StatusQuoHoes. 

Golddiggers are like panhandlers. Once they realize that you will not give them what they want, the move on. You don't want those girls. They are nothing but problems. Because the only way to demonstrate your appreciation is through monetary compensation. Fuck em!

StatusQuoHoes, however, are just used to guys buying them drinks. The moment you shut that shit down, the sooner she realizes that you are not a typical guy. Interest builds as she wonders what would make you buy her a drink. 

I normally spin this into having the girl buy me drinks. Typically a shot and a beer. Why? because I'm worth it. At that point she has invested in YOU and now with the ball in your court. Take control of the night.

Just say something.,187,29,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/18fhwq/this_crap_is_easy_once_you_get_over_yourself_just/,"I swore to myself that I wouldn't do some ""Thanks guys, this is awesome"" style post after I finally took the plunge, but I want this to be a message to all those guys that are struggling to get over their AA or whatever else you want to call it. I personally referred to it as my ""I hate other people"" syndrome, but I finally just came to terms and realized that I'm terrified of just speaking up in these sorts of situations. 

I was at the gym tonight pretty late, unlike most of you gentlemen out working the Mardi Gras crowd. I have an exam tomorrow so I didn't want to get wild tonight. I planned on doing legs, so as soon as I put my coat down I made a beeline straight for the squat racks (do your squats!). I get over to an empty one and there is a cute HB7 (yoga pants, tank top, and all) doing her lady-squats in the rack next to me, and something just clicked. Instead of putting my headphones in and blasting my music like usual, I decided that I was going to be social for a change (worked out nicely since they didn't play shit music like usual).

Then I hit the brick wall that is my AA. 

I did 3 sets of squats and 2 sets of hack squats (this is relevant) and was probably in that rack next to her for about 15 minutes, and didn't say a word. I'm an idiot. I moved and did some leg extensions or something. A little while later though I got another chance. We were both on the leg curl machines, and you know what I did? Nothing! Because I am an idiot. 

So I'm almost done with my workout, I've blown countless good opportunites, and I see that she's headed toward the exit. So I decide ""This is it. Just do something."" I start walking over to the cubby where my jacket is so I can set my phone in it. She's standing near that, but she was talking to some dude (not some huge alpha guy, just some skinny guy like me talking about a class they have together or something). I didn't want to interrupt, so I set my phone with my jacket and went and got some water. I get a drink and see that she isn't talking to that guy anymore, and muster up all the courage I have to ask her, ""so your legs hurt like hell, right?"" I don't know why I said that. I mean, my logic was that she was doing leg workouts so her legs must have been sore. But that's literally all I could come up with. An hour at the gym of wanting to talk to this girl, and that's all I could say. Whatever. 

Fortunately, she's like, ""Yeah, but that's exactly what I was going for, so it's awesome."" And I agreed with her that it's one of the best feelings ever. She then commented on those ""weird behind the back squat things"" I was doing earlier (those hack squats). I told her that was the first time I'd ever done them and they were pretty different but I liked them a lot. She then asked if I had heard about some '44 body weight' workouts program that had been going around, and I told her I had not. She said she would send it to me. And at that point, I hand her my phone so she can put her number in it. Easy. So freaking easy. I gave her a reason to contact me, and I was in. That was it. 

I don't have any idea what will come of this. I don't really care. I'll definitely follow up and get her to go get drinks this weekend or something, but all I can think about is how easy this is when you just get over yourself and talk to people. And not just girls, I mean anybody. And I opened with 'do your legs hurt.' *What the fuck kind of line is that?* I guess the point is, it isn't one. Just talk. What's the worst that can happen? 

This got a little more ramble-y than it was supposed to be, but I just wanted to say something to you guys with AA or whatever you want to call it. It's easier than you realize. Good luck out there.

Been a sedditor for awhile and all that good jazz. I learned all these techniques, these fucking games to try and elicit certain emotions. Ultimately the point of almost everything is to make the girls have a good time, to make them get excited all with the ultimate goal of her transmitting these properties onto you as a person. I feel like that's where a lot of us get stuck at. Or from reading around it seems like I wasn't the only one at least.

This was fine. I'm in college so I'm sort of living in abundance but I'd pull my share of decent looking girls. Then something changed. I stopped giving any semblance of a shit. I stopped being anything other than myself and I began to do whatever I want. 

All this crap I designed in my head and wasted time worrying about ? I was going up against one of the main rules of the game inherently. I was putting her on a pedestal. Don't take mental notes, don't be some fucking sheep. Don't think, do. Go out wanting to have fun and have fun. If you're doing things for the sake of doing them, for the intrinsic joy and rush of that action, it will be so much more powerful. Instead of feeding off some fake thing you read about and are trying to pull off, shes feeding off you and that leads to much more powerful emotions. You want to bring that girl back tonight? Tell her that, look her dead in the eyes and say what you want. Not to try and impress her to run some next level inception shit on her but because you want to do that.

And part of this new found shamelessness is to absolutely abolish embarrassment. That shit is for the birds. You'll definitely notice that as this change happens to you girls catch on. You're that guy. That 20% that gets all the girls. That player. I've had the most gorgeous girls tell me I could get with any girl in here tonight just because I took control and did whatever I was feeling and wanted to do that would make my night fun. Me and you? We're the deciders, take the action be the acting force don't wait for stuff to happen. The best part of all this? You just get the same shit tests now and they're so easy to beat. ""You're trouble"" ""Yah I am trouble, but you know trouble is more fun"" ""You're a player"" ""Yah I've gotten with 34 girls tonight, let's make it 35'

This has been my mindset change for pretty much two weeks now and I got to tell you it's been a crazy two weeks. It's been so liberating. Not only have I gotten with some incredible women but most importantly I've had so much fucking fun.

And when he said no, then make up excuses, when he was done I approached her, carry on a conversation then invite her back to the table.

She said yes, I led her to our table put her next to my friend that wanted her, introduced my friends, then find a conversation topic that she loves. While she's talking I step out and look around to try to get my friends involved, to my surprise they're all sitting their dumbfounded, staring at her tits. After she's done another one of my friends tries to be funny, but stutters allot, and after spitting it out, 2 other friends start laughing trying to force the laugh on her, but she sits their with an awkward smile on her face. I pull my friend next to her aside and tell him to do something, besides awkwardly sitting their. We come back, he tries to hit on her, she asks him to buy a drink, he agrees, it's over. 

Afterward my friends get mad at me telling me I ruined the night out. I told them I was tired of being the group of cheesy guys in room who stared at chicks, drank beers, and talked about boring stuff (jobs). And that trying to mix it up, by bringing a girl over, I was doing them a favor. My stubborn friend who always tried to be the leader, but tried to hard to be cocky, tried to tell me I was wrong, by saying ""it was going perfectly fine you dumb ass, then you brought that bitch over here"" I told him all we where doing was staring at girls, and talking about how much things sucked. All my other friends like always agreed with him. I called a cab, and went home.

I will be going to the same bar next Friday. Not with my friends, but alone.  I will purposely sarge women in front of them, and try to K-close girls in their faces. It might be my buzzed anger talking, but tonight was a breakthrough. My friends don't like my new, changed self, and they are going to have to see myself happier without them.

Edit: so I slept on it, and I understand now that I did put them in an awkward situation. But something I still want is to make the nights out better. In a sense of the nights out before where depressing, and if someone tried to bring up a happy subject, it was turned back into a rant about how much we hate stuff. I've tried to give some simple tricks to my friends, such as not doing stuff for women, to approach with an opener I gave them, and to not be afraid.

In the last 4 years, we kept in sporadic contact, conversations were often sexual, but nothing came out of it. About a week and a half ago, HB7 was seeing a guy. She and I were hanging out alone, I was flirty, and fun, made her a few drinks, etc. Evening ended, we went our separate ways. 

Yesterday she texts me saying she is single, and wants to get trashed. I keep it cool. Tell her I a busy now, but will text her in a few hours with plans. (I wasn't actually busy! Hahaha!) 9 o'clock rolls around, I text her telling her she can come over for drinks (I have a pretty bitching cabinet of drinks) she responds saying her friend HB8 is here, and wants to know if it's cool if she comes too. I tell her ""Of course, but you guys need to promise to behave."" I tell her I'll pick them up soon, (they don't have a car, and live semi close.) I take my sweet as time getting there. It's a 5 minute drive at most, and I get there 30 minutes after I sent the text. At this point she is blowing up my phone saying how they want to party with me, etc. 

I show up, meet HB8 for the first time, and am blown away by how cute she is. We introduce ourselves, shake hands, talk about how we were in the same year in High School, but didn't know each other. I make fun of her a little bit, and am stating so hard. I'm flirty, and they are both laughing the whole car ride. They come over, I start playing bartender, making drinks. HB8 is clearly into me, but has a boyfriend. Keeps saying things like ""I wish I could be single for a night, like HB7!"" I keep telling her things like ""What you have is special, and your boyfriend sounds like a pretty cool dude."" I was being genuine, I wasn't trying to game her. At one point HB8 decided it's too hot in my room, and she's wearing a bikini top, so it's okay if she takes her shirt off. She and HB7 start doing drinks off HB8's stomach. We drink, a lot. We're all pretty cocked. HB8 says to me ""Would you be freaked out by people having sex in the same room you were in?"" I told her no, and made them both pinky swear, and then told them a story of how I almost had 4 some, but one of the girls bitched out. (2 girls, 2 guys.) They told me a story about how they almost had a 4 some, but one of the guys bitched out. HB8 grabs me, and says ""You should take your shirt off."" It's on. I tell her maybe, after we smoke some weed. We go outside, and smoke a joint. HB8 comes back to my room, HB7 goes to pee. I tell HB8 she looks nice, but would look way better with a bow tie on. So I grab one of my bow ties, start tying it around her neck. It's not one of those pre-tied bull shitters. The whole time, I'm caressing her neck with my fingers, and she is moaning slightly. She wants more, I straighten the bow tie, and sit down on the couch. 

HB7 comes back up, and sits on the bed. HB8 sits next to me on the couch, starts unbotting my shirt, and whispers ""fuck her"" Shirt comes off. HB7 is on bed texting, I push her phone away, push her down, start making out with her. Things escalate. She is on top of me. HB8 is on the couch, making frustrated noises. I tell her it's not cheating if it's with another girl. She gets up, takes her clothes off, fucked both of them. Hour later HB7 falls alseep, fuck HB8 again. Took them home back to HB7's house. HB8 says she wants to go home to get ciggaretts, I drop HB7 off, take HB8 to her house. Fuck her again in my car. Then bring her back to HB7's.

Awareness Radius (AR) is the area around you that you are aware of. For instance: A bear is eating in the backwoods as a little rabit hops past the predator's AR. The bear does not acknowlege its presences on account of the rabit's abject power. The bear is not threatened so he has no reason to watch the rabit.

The little rabit needs to watch out for everything and everyone or it will be killed. The rabit is threatened by dogs, bears, and any other animal bigger than itself. Thus is it wise for the rabit to have a wide AR.

On the other hand if another bear crosses the first bear's path, his vicinity will be known. The second bear is just as powerful, so he comes into the first bear's AR. Once they establish a friendly relationship they will not be detected on each other's AR, unless they are threatened.


Thus having a low AR shows dominance while a wide AR shows nervousness.

**How is this related to humans?**

Well, when you are having a conversation with someone, and your name is called, what do you do?

If you have a wide AR you will jerk your head quickly in the direction your name is being called. This shows weakness in that you turned your headquickly and you stopped your conversation to address your colleague.

If you have a narrow AR you will keep following the context of your conversation and you allow your colleague to call upon you after you are done talking.

Another example of wide AR is, when you are doing whatever it is that interest you, and you see something at the corner of your eye, you look at it. For instance, if you are reading a book and you see someone walk by, out of the corner of your eye, you look at it. How can you read a book if you look up every 3 seconds just to see who it is that is crossing your path?

Instead, you should never give your attention to something that is not in your awareness range of vision (ARV). You have no reason to give them your attention if they have lower status.

**The Common Mistake**

The common mistake with AR is that people will try to ignore everyone. When they walk down the street, they look straight ahead, not making any eye contact. This is their understanding that they are too good to even acknowledge these beautiful women passing by. Most AFC do this but not for the same reasons. AFC's don't make eye contact because they are intimidated by others. Although they are following the concept, they haven't mastered it. Making eye contact shows stability and security vs. the AFC's shyness and insecurity.

**What is the Solution?**

The solution is to establish a good awareness range of vision (ARV). This way you don't act needy by snaping your head to a side just to see whats going on. You want to stay relax and project a calm and dominant image. Remember you are the bear, you don't look behind you when you hear a rabit.

**How do I Establish a Good Awareness Range of Vision?**

To build a good ARV you must do the following exircise!

Step 1: First close your left eye.

Step 2: With your right eye, look to the left. You will see part of your nose.

Step 3: Close your right eye.

Step 4: Now, with your left eye look to the right. You will see the other part of your nose.

The area inbetween these two boundaries is your range of vision which you should be aware of. If a cute girl (or any human being) is seen in your ARV, then you should make eye contact and give a friendly smile. If you must look over to your side, then do so only by slowly moving your head in that direction.

Congratulations, you are now one step closer to achieving your goal of becoming successful with women.

Thanks Seddit!!(Long Read),198,37,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/o1d5p/fr_24yo_virgin_no_more_thanks_sedditlong_read/,"Well I've been a struggling AFC ever since I can remember, and about 6 months ago I stumbled upon this reddit and have learned lots. During this whole process I noticed many things that were discussed here so thought I would point them out for other people in my position.

**Dont Always look to get laid.**
One of the big things I've taken from it is just go and have a good time. Looking back I realized mistakes I made like only wanting to go out if there was a chance I could pick up. After that mindset changed things fell into my lap (literally). 

Met up with an old college friend to catch up on things. While hanging out at the bar one of his friends joins us (HB8) so she joins us for a couple drinks having a fun time, but the night ends and everyone splits ways to go home. On my way home I message my friend asking about the situation on HB. He says she single and gives me her #. I decided to wait till the next day to text, but notice by the time I got home from the Bar she's already sent me a message on facebook asking if I was the person she met.*Now old me would have thought hey this is great now I can chat to her on this, but as I started to remember everytime this situation happens I would end up getting friendzoned so figured I got prevent it. So replied to her facebook message the next day saying ""yup, but I never use this txt me instead"" Phew avoided the whole facebook.

**Kino kino kino!**
So after texting back and forth we setup to go to a party together. After a couple drinks I noticed she started actually do kino to me! My biggest mistake I always make is I'm too shy to kino, so once this actually happened to me game on! time to use some techniques used from seddit. After a little kino back she drags me into a random bedroom, we start making out, still doing kino until she unbuttons her pants. Yay I think I'm finally going to make it, but get some LMR when I go to grab a condom. 

**Finally taking the Lead**
After that we hang out a couple times but nothing really progresses again, just a bunch making out. At this point now I'm thinking I got to do something to get past this. I need to ramp things up. Gave her a text one morning asking how her day is going, she said meh. Which I respond that mines been awesome, and I want it to continue, suggest we hang out that night, she's a little hesitant and says well I have to work till 9 then I'm not sure if I'm for much. Which I just respond with ""See you at 9 :)"" (Learned Girls Loving Smiley Faces haha), then stop talking to her for the rest of the day. I just show up at her work at 9, she see's me in the parking lot walks up and says ""you win"" and gets in the car. Go back to my place enjoy a couple drinks and decide to escalate. She ends up taking off my shirt and comments ""wow looks like you actually do go to the gym"" with that remark I say yup, pick her up and carry her to the bedroom (Felt like a Boss move to do - Highly recommend adding the gym to anyone's routine!) Things start to get hot and heavy again but before I reach **LMR** I played a move that I didn't even realize till after. Instead of just reaching for the condom I asked her should I grab one, which she agreed and we sealed the deal.
*After all this I stumbled upon an escalation ladder on this reddit (can't remember the name) but it mentioned avoiding LMR by asking her if you should get a condom instead of just grabbing it, seemed to help!* 
But after all is done and we are lying in bed chatting she says to me **""wow, I'm not sure what you did tonight but I like this side of you**

Needless to say I felt like a Boss after it, and not sure why I didn't just go ahead and do this years ago, got tired of just sitting back and finally went for it

Another funny note to take out of this, got a little delayed writing this FR, all this happened during Movember when I  was attempting to grow  a funny looking moustache, and I still pulled it off, so it appears **looks aren't everything!** Not to say I'm ugly but always been a little self concious and that realization has helped me, that I could pull it. Since then I've gotten dates with 2 other HB's, trying to avoid that oneinitis that gets talked about all the time

*******TL;DR:** Changing Mindset having a good time, Kino and taking the lead after improving those 3 aspects my game has improved tenfold*****

Thanks again Seddit!

The items on this list are probably the easiest and quickest things you can apply right now in order to get almost instant results.


**1.    Believe That All Women Are Equal**


This is probably one of the best things you can EVER do. Think about the least attractive chick you’ve ever banged. Let’s say she was a 5 (out of 10) and that’s your absolute lowest standard. Wasn’t it easy to attract her? Of course it was, because you couldn’t care less if it went either way.


Now, if you see a chick that’s a 10, would you treat her differently? You probably will…because she’s a 10 and you’d think she deserves some special treatment. Well, this special treatment that you often give to “hotter” girls is what really stops you from scoring them.


If you’d believe that all women are equal, and that 10’s don’t really deserve any special treatment, you’re successful attraction behavior would be the one you actually use with them and as a result, will be the one that actually allows you to attract them.


Make it your mission to see all girls the same. There’s no 10’s, no hotties, they’re just OK.  Convince your mind to lower their value because it will allow you to have tighter game.


**2.    Don’t Ask For Her Permission**


I see so many guys doing this that I actually laugh when it happens. They ask a girl “Do you want to dance? Can I kiss you? Can I have your phone number? What happened to just taking a girl on the dance floor? What happened to just saying “Give me your phone number so I/we can…” What happened to just going in for the kiss? And finally, what happened to just being a MAN? Do you really need to ask for her permission? Of course not.


Because most guys never get asked for their permission, they are absolutely oblivious to how lame this makes them look. Asking for permission makes you look incredibly weak, not-sure about yourself, scared of rejection and finally, it creates an awkward moment in which the girl actually has to think about kissing/dancing with you, an awkward moment in which she has time to think about how weak you are and come up with a way to reject you. This unnecessary moment could have been easily avoided just by DOING IT instead of asking her for permission.


**3.    Don’t Lean In During The Conversation**


This is another fundamental one which is commonly ignored. What guys need to realize is that by leaning in to listen to her every word they are basically telling the chick “I’m so glad I’m talking to you right now, you’re so amazing”. Or even funnier, you see guys talking to her ear, in a venue where the music isn’t lout at all.


Take my word for it; you do not want her to know how excited you are when you’re talking to her. I get it that you are, she looks great but, you seriously need to work on NOT SHOWING her these things. You don’t want her to think that you’ve got no experience with women, that you don’t really get a lot of girls which ultimately means, you’re a loser.


You want her to think highly of you so just act cool and let her be the one that leans in. If you’ve made her interested, even just that little bit, she will.


**4.    Embrace Rejection**


This is probably the most common issue guys have, that fear of rejection. Rejection is NATURAL, it’s a common occurrence. It will be IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to avoid rejection and therefore we should embrace it as part of our life.


Honestly, I personally get rejected more often than I score. I’m also sure that this is the case with MOST guys that actually get laid often. My current ratio is around 1 bang out of 3-4 approaches. Sure some nights it’s the first chick and other nights it’s nothing but, overall I’m around 1 in 3-4 which means that’s around 28% success rate. This also makes my rejection percentage 72%. That’s huge!


The only way to ever beat this fear of rejection is to expect it every time. If you’re absolutely sure that this girl will reject you, then you won’t have any problem approaching her and getting rejected. If you get rejected, simply remember what you did/said and never use it again. Then, by the time you’re at your 6th girl you’re most surely going to have something good to say.


Finally, if you’re the “love thyself” type that STILL fears rejection, know that being with you is the best experience any woman can have, and if she rejects you, she just lost the best thing that could ever happen to her, so, there’s no point in drooling over this fact since she’s the only one that’s losing out.


**5.    Be A Man Of Mystery**


Most guys make offers (tell everything about them) in hopes that a chick will like them. This can sometimes land you the girl (if the offer is good enough and she’s somewhat materialistic) but not ALWAYS. If you’re a man of mystery, you create intrigue and the chick will want to know more about you. This basically means you’re creating interest in yourself; she wants to know more about you thus having a lot of reasons to keep talking to you and see you again. This gives you plenty of time to spit real game which will inevitably lead to a lay regardless of how good your initial offer would have been.


In order to play the man of mystery card, just avoid her direct questions about yourself in a funny way or by asking more questions about herself. This will also allow you to MOLD your personality based on what she desires therefore dramatically increasing your chances of scoring the lay.


**6.    Don’t Be Boring**


Being boring doesn’t just apply to your conversation with her. Being boring is about yourself. If a chick sees you just standing there with your friends, just standing there alone at the bar, on your phone, watching the bar TV, she’ll already assume that you’re boring. By the time you get the courage to approach her, you’re already that boring guy that was just standing there a minute ago.


So, don’t just stand there looking like a total buzzkill, talk to your friends, someone at the bar, anyone, just don’t act like you have nothing to do.

1361724497.0,161,self.seduction,194ymu,"45 YO (M) Give you my perspective on ""the game"" and seduction. ",198,37,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/194ymu/45_yo_m_give_you_my_perspective_on_the_game_and/,"So I will give my short version of my experience practicing the game and the art of seduction. 

Divorced 2007; two kids. no money (bankrupted by divorce...thank you NJ superior court!) 
When I first started to go out was in 2007. The first book I read was ""The game"" by neil strauss. At the time, that book seemed unbelievable to me. I took what I could get when the opportunity presented itself, which was infrequently. I am not a bad looking guy but just did not realize that I could consciously go out and choose who I wanted to hook up with. After reading The Game I started reading anything and everything about pickup and seduction. Let me state it is a fantastic journey and I am having success with women that I never thought I would have ever in my life. 
So after first reading the game, I ordered David Deangelos two Ebooks and read The Mystery Method. That is where it all began. I started to read this stuff but more importantly I began to apply it! At first it was tough. Getting rejected is NOT easy. But I persisted and began to work on myslef. I paid more attention to my grooming habits, Started to work on controlling my weight through diet and exercise and started to work on my attitude (Huge)! Slowly at first things started to fall into place. I pulled a few girls from bars (6-7's). I went on match. Got dates based on my looks but alot of them fizzled quickly because I did not have the game to back it up. Then I started to pull more regularly so then I started to go after 7 and 8's. after a year of that I up my minimum to 8 and 9's after a year of that. I am now pulling the 10's for my age category. I recently started a relationship with a legitimate hottie. She is 45 but looks 30. Her body in mint and I ran into a 26 YO guy who i work with when I was out with her and the next monday he came up to me and asked me who the hottie was who I was with. When I told him it was my girlfriend his jaw dropped and then he proceeded to tell all the younger guys in the office that I was dating a hottie which built my status up in the eyes of these younger colleagues. 
So back on point, So my journey has not been linear but it has been consitent progress over time. I now do not even worry about women anymore and that is where you want to be! For those of you guys struggling; keep at it is all I can tell you. Keep reading and learning and over time it will fall into place. most of all, keep practicing! I went out for three years, flying solo, opening sets, getting shot down, occaissionally having a success. This kept me going. Keep working on yourself NOT just your game. Have a life outside of the game. 
Last words for now: It took me six years of consistent ""practice"" to get where I am right now that I am able to pull the hottest girls in my age group. The woman I am dating right now is 45 yo, looks 30 and has a bangin body and we have amazing sex! My life wasn't always this way but the investment in time, energy, money, and disappointment was all worth it and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I only wish I knew about seduction and the game BEFORE I got married. I would have saved myself a whole lot of heartache and financial pain but that is a story for another day. Good luck to all you, the woman of your dreams is waiting for you!

1358024619.0,156,self.seduction,16gcx5,What Seddit can teach women- if they're open,206,50,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16gcx5/what_seddit_can_teach_women_if_theyre_open/,"27/f here, Philosophy/Psychology degree holder and close personal friend of a top PUA (LoveSystems instructor) of over 7 years, since before he learned game. 

After reading the comments of a previous female sedditor's ""insights"", people began debating if men should trust what women say about what they want and how they feel. In my opinion, a woman should learn from what is taught in the seduction community, not attempt to teach back with words- because what's taught in seduction is taught because it works. Actions speak louder than words. 

In the year I spent in New York sitting in on group field teaches and classes, listening to my friend field phone calls from clients, and reading LS material, I learned more about myself and my sexuality than any other time in my life. 

I slowly began to understand why I was attracted to assholes and not nice guys, I began to see what some cute shy guys were doing wrong on dates with me, and really wishing they just knew how to not turn me off so badly with DLVs and general shows of apology so I could take advantage of all the great qualities they did have. 

A woman must first acknowledge that she's secretly looking for a social advantage in choosing a mate, as hollow and vile as that sounds to us based on moral conditioning and social memes, if she wants to be able to choose mates on a more rational basis, that is, a woman must understand the evolutionary and instinctive drives in her sexuality if she wants or needs to overcome them. 

If I'm honest, nothing makes me wetter faster than a tall, muscular, confident, intelligent alpha male being dominating, charming, and witty- but those guys (who are like that naturally) typically exist without certain qualities that we women do honestly know are more important to living a happy life, like empathy, forethought, insight, being nurturing, etc... because their qualities work for them SO WELL in life from the get go, they don't have to develop them. 

The seduction community, in my opinion, is a gift. While it may put the tools of attraction in the hands of some undeveloped poon craving adolescent minded ass wads, it also puts those same tools in the hands of intelligent, considerate, intelligent men who would otherwise continue being blown off by women. 

Women WANT to be seduced. We WANT to go on dates with men who make us feel relaxed and secure with them, and when you control your frame, stay confident and non reactive, and have real, genuine hobbies and thoughts to share, you allow us to enter a state we rarely are able to be in. Defenses down, genuine connection, honest enjoyment. 

Anyway my main point here is that I think the seduction community has a lot to offer women in terms of the sex positive movement. Many women struggle to truly discover who they are in terms of their sexual psychology, and learning what women react to more often on average is a great first clue to understanding one's self. 

Sure we vary woman to woman, our cultural upbringings and personal preferences creating deviations everywhere, but we're al wired up with the same hormones and instincts. 

For me, discovering that I liked a dominant man helped me accept my submissive preferences sexually, and, only since having accepted that have I been able to develop my dominant side of my sexuality as well. 

Forcing women to understand themselves by looking at the ugly truths-
e.g. we don't like dating a guy shorter than ourselves, we don't like DLVs, etc, 
opens the door for us to actually accept ourselves, and then change ourselves from the inside out instead of repressing ourselves into whatever it is we think we're supposed to be... you know, virgin sluts, or however that was supposed to work. 

I think what seduction teaches can help everyone build confidence, when looked at the right way. 

Anyway, I &lt;3 you seddit, keep doing what you're doing. 
I should probably edit this, but fuck it. Or Butt Fuck it, if that's what you're into ;)

1312556388.0,161,self.seduction,j9wop,10 Lifestyle Tips,223,62,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/j9wop/10_lifestyle_tips/,"If you're subscribed to Love Systems Insider, you already got this. I thought there was some really good info here, so I'm sharing it with Seddit. Credit to Savoy of Love Systems. Enjoy.

* **Lifestyle is the foundation that supports all your cool pickup skills (approaching, attraction, framing, etc.).** With an attractive lifestyle, you can get away with more ""mistakes."" Guys who have terrible lifestyles can still be great with women - but they have much, much less room for error. Lifestyle isn't enough by itself, but it sure makes everything else easier.

* **Lifestyle begins at home. Your living situation says SO much about you to a woman, and it's not something you can avoid.** If you want to date her or have sex with her, she's probably going to see where you live. It's not about having the fancy address or the luxury mansion. Use your living space to tell her a story about yourself and hint that there's more to come. Use your home to show your identity. Did you and her bond over travel stories? Have pictures or objects from your travels kicking around. Each should have a story behind it...but only if she asks. Did you say you are passionate about cooking? Don't have an empty fridge. Everything that applies to fashion also applies to your home. She's going to assume that everything about how you look and how you live is a deliberate choice that you made. How she feels about these choices leads right in to how she feels about you. Being true to an attractive identity is more important than fancy furniture or how big your mortgage is.

* **You are who you spend time with.** OK, that's not literally true, but it's true enough for a woman who might date you. Are your friends boring and unexciting? Are they all party animals? Is your TV your best friend, or do you have an interesting life? For a woman, dating you means being part of your world. So introduce her to people and have friends who help you create a lifestyle that she wants to be part of.

* **Be more social and outgoing - every day.** Force yourself to meet one new person or have one social conversation you wouldn't normally have. For one thing, practice and experience always pay off. Social masters put themselves in social situations all the time. Experience, experience, experience helps you become the person who intuitively knows ""the right thing to say"" in any situation.

* **If you want to date more than one woman at a time, your lifestyle has to ""fit.""** A woman is much more likely to accept you dating multiple women if you have a lifestyle that ""fits."" If you have the kind of life where you are outgoing, constantly meeting new people, and very social, a woman is much more likely to accept you having multiple relationships than if she sees you as someone who stays in every night on your computer.

* **Passion conquers all.** We all know or have heard of the guy who lives in his friend's basement but brings home attractive women any time he wants. To do this, you have to have great skills with women. But even then, for a lot of these guys their lifestyle is not as bad as it looks. If you're following your passion and your dream (going for your PhD, making it as a musician, artist, or writer), going back to school, etc - then your lifestyle can fit and be attractive - even if you're in the basement. In other words, do not confuse lifestyle with wealth. They are not at all the same thing.

* **Your job is not an excuse.** Some jobs can be lifestyle killers. Whether you're working a million hours per week, busy every evening, weekend and holiday, your time is never your own, or if you have to live somewhere you don't want - these are real lifestyle problems. Unless it's part of your identity and passion (e.g., endless shifts at the hospital could be worth it if you're on your way to being a doctor and love medicine), fix this. There are other jobs. Even in this economy. Ironically, a lot of guys in these 75-hour workweeks got into these careers because they wanted a better lifestyle. Do above-average pay, expensive clothes, and nice cars make you more attractive to women? All things being equal, sure. But 9 times out of 10, a woman is going to be more interested in the guy with interesting friends, experiences, and time and passion to pursue them over the banking drone who hates his job but can afford fancy restaurants. It's your life. If you don't like something, change it. No one else will change it for you.

* **Lifestyle without pickup is boring or worse.** I said at the beginning of this that lifestyle is the foundation. The thing about a foundation is you have to build on it. Or else it's just a boring foundation. Pickup is what lets you convey your lifestyle and personality to beautiful women in a way that is attractive and interesting to her. Even if you've never met her before, even if she's the most standoffish ""10"" beauty queen in the world, etc. Without that, most guys turn women off by being boring... they don't know the triggers and attraction switches to engage her emotionally, to keep that push/pull dynamic going, to make her qualify herself, and so on. Or, worse, they try to force their lifestyle down her throat and come as insecure and bragging. Since I started Love Systems, I've worked with hundreds of multi-millionaire business owners, B-list celebrities, and people who lead amazing lives. And it can be unbelievably frustrating for these guys because they know that if most women got to know them, they'd be attracted. But breaking through her defenses, her social conditioning, her automatic behavior and responses, etc., can be a challenge. That's where pickup skills come in.

* **Showing is better than telling. If you have to tell, make her ask.** Your lifestyle is something that exists in reality. So don't just talk about it, let her experience it. So if you have cool friends, introduce her to them. If you've got access to cool events, take her to them. And so on. Don't talk about something you could just as easily do. Sometimes you don't have this option - like when you're first meeting her. If there's something you really want her to know about you, it's often most effective to bait her into asking you about it. If I were a great salsa dancer, I might tell her a story about my friend Joe who I met at a dance show. The story would be short and having nothing to do with dance. But she's likely to wonder what a dance show is. I'd answer ""oh, I'm a salsa dancer. Do you dance?"" Now I've got two balls in the air.

After trying to sarge at clubs in and around Boston, I decided to escalate with any women above HB5 that I found attractive to my personal tastes in everyday settings. After sporadically getting into day game, I just decided to be proactive in whatever context I found myself.
 

Tonight, I just finished up a major project and went out with a buddy of mine for a couple of drinks at the local pub. The waitress who came by was a solid HB7. I saw how attractive she was, made eye contact, and she reciprocated my big smile. Good sign #1: She asked us what we were celebrating, having clearly overheard my positive talk with the friend about finishing this big task. I told her about the project, and then we got into a discussion about her holding onto old notes and things after finishing something. I said I send everything past the recycle bin and deleted it for kicks, and noticed her laugh and move a little closer. I had a momentary thought about the reality that good-looking waitresses probably get hit on all the time, but recognized it as a limiting belief and evacuated it from my mind.


While my friend and I were hanging out, I noticed she made it a point to stop extra at our table, brought us extra stuff and was far more attentive than if she was just flirting for tips. When she brought my second drink she made a little spiral with the straw cover. I made strong eye contact, a smile naturally came onto my face, and I said: ""teach me how to do that straw folding thing."" She explained it and then said ""thanks for noticing."" I negged her by saying she obviously stole it from someone else at the restaurant, and by George it worked! More laughter, and it seemed like she actively enjoying a guy teasing her - a big plus.


She kept making eye contact as she worked her route around the bar, and at some point my buddy got the hint, went to the bathroom for a few and said to me: ""how long do I need to be gone?"" The next time she came by I simply said: ""You seem like a cool girl and I'd like to ask you out."" Big smile, a ""yeah, definitely"" and a number in return.


The biggest obstacle for me has been inner game; acknowledging that I'm taking care of myself physically, have interesting hobbies and am trying to be outcome independent. This is is the first time I can remember when I've #-closed with no ego involved and would have totally fine if I didn't get her digits. Is this what it feels like to know you have a lot of options?

If you're anything like me you're probably the kind of guy who wants it all. And why shouldn’t we all be that way? We’re only on this planet for a finite number of years and our youth only lasts so long. Why waste it settling for something sub-par. You've probably convinced yourself that having an active social life and sleeping with beautiful fun girls isn't all its cracked up to be. I used to think that. Guess what? I was DEAD WRONG. It is fucking awesome. 


Advice to the new guys. Anything worth having takes work. Keep doing it, keep approaching, keep failing, and keep learning. You'll get better. I know it seems weird or unnatural at first but to get something you’ve never had you’re gonna have to do something you’ve never done. When Sean Connery was filming his first the James Bond film the director noticed he looked awkward on camera when he wore his signature tuxedo. He asked why he looked so stiff. To which Mr. Connery replied that he isn’t used to wearing one so it feels weird. The director told him to take the tux home with him, wear it every day and even sleep in in it. Basically don’t take it off. By being in the tuxedo 24/7 he got used to wearing it, and thus looked more natural on camera. 

Some of the moments I regret the most in my life are when I failed to make a move for no other reason than I was a goddamn pussy. This is why I always approach now, I always go in for the kiss and have the mentality that should I be denied it’ll be great story to tell my friends later. I can handle rejection, what I can’t handle is knowing I might have missed out on an amazing girl simply because I didn’t have the stones to escalate, that’s the shit that keeps me up at night.


You see a dude your age walking down the street with a beautiful girl on his arm and naturally you think what does that guy have that I don’t? He’s so lucky. For starters he’s probably in better shape because he has discipline and works hard and it’s also safe to assume he makes more money that you because he’s more assertive in his professional life. But it’s also likely that this girl didn’t just walk up to him and jump on his dick. He had to approach. Just like you.


Most guys figure that their perfect girl/wife/partner will just show up one day and everything will work out. This is false. The OPPORTUNITY will present itself but you’ll undoubtedly fuck it up if you have no idea what to do or someone else shows up and steals your thunder. If someone offers you a chance to shoot a free throw for a million dollars but you’ve never once shot a basketball, guess what buddy? you’re gonna fucking miss.


So go out tonight. Approach as many girls as possible with the aim of just having a good fucking time. Get drunk. Dance like you own the place. Girls love to have a good time, and they want to get laid just as much as you do. Every girl in that bar is open to meeting someone, if they weren’t they wouldn’t be a bar or club on a Saturday night. If you fail just laugh it off, and get over it. You’re gonna let some drunk bitch bruise your ego? Fuck no you’re not. You’re better than that. You’re awesome and she sucked. Move on to the next girl. Your girl is there, you just having talked to her yet.

Ten years from now you’ll be telling all people about this. Because trust me, everyone will want to know what it was like and what you did as a young man. It’s my contention that people like a good story, so BE the story. Live vicariously; through yourself. It’s all up to you, and only you, to decide right now whether it’ll be an epic story, or a mere fact, a mundane occurrence; another stupid footnote in an otherwise boring and uninteresting life. I can imagine nothing more depressing than someone who is fine playing a supporting role in their OWN life story, who sits in a corner watching everyone else doing awesome shit, assuming all they have to do is just wait their turn. A man who doesn’t dare greatly will never know the thrill of victory, or the triumph of success and for that reason, no one will never remember his name. So if not now, then when? What are you waiting for? Go out there and take it, you’ll be glad you did. Sure you may fail, but never surrender and never forget your indomitable will is there to carry you through the hard parts should they come. It’s all for that perfect close. When the opportunity presents itself and you handle it like a fucking boss. That’s what makes all the hard work and failure worth it. Then you can spend the rest of the night listening to everyone tell you what a lucky bastard you are. Luck? Hell, if they only knew…..

As soon as I walked in a girl, in a set of 5, and I locked eyes. I held eye contact with her from basically the door to my table. I chose to sit caddy corner to her table. At this point I had no intention of even talking to her because I was just out to have dinner and head home. I catch her glancing over and over so finally I just sat there and blatantly looked right at her for a few minutes. 

By the time I'm done with my meal her group is leaving. My Buddy and I move from the table to the bar where we could watch the games. A while later a two of our mutual friends show up. 

About thirty minutes later the girl and her group come back into the bar, and they so happen to know our mutual friend Steve. Steve is gaming hard on her, and being a little tipsy at this point I turned around to watch the train wreck. She locks eyes with me again, blushes and whispers something to her friend. 

I'm back to watching the game when I feel a pair of breasts pressed against my arm. And what do you know, it's her! 

I turn to open my body to her and she asks how I know Steve, why I'm here etc. After a few minutes of banter....

Me: hey, so Amy, you're going to buy me one more drink and then I'm taking you home.

Amy: :: blank face::

Me: I'll have a whiskey and coke.

Signal for bartender.

Amy: wait aren't you supposed to buy me drinks.

Me: if you think I'm going to sleep with you without you spending any money on me, you're bat shit crazy.

Amy: OK fine just one drink

And boom goes the dynamite. Walked the two blocks back, dealt with some lmr but sealed the deal. I gave her my number this morning we'll see what happens.

1345248637.0,154,self.seduction,yel55,"Some general advice to guys just starting with this stuff from a ""Veteran""",187,33,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yel55/some_general_advice_to_guys_just_starting_with/,"I took a bootcamp four years ago, which in this community pretty ancient.   I did the whole transformation thingy, I went from 260 lb fat-ass to 190 lb rock star, and I learned a lot along the way.  Basically, I wanted to give some advice that I never got starting out, and wish I had.  Some will disagree with the stuff I’m saying, but I really don’t give a shit.  


**A majority of what guys say online is bullshit**
Yup, most guys are lying or stretching the truth.  “This one chick I was banging” can easily mean “The one chick I’ve ever banged, ever.”  Take everything with a grain a salt while realizing that some guys are trying to insert bragging rights into everything they say.  A lot of guys will lie flat out as responses to other guy’s posts.  Basically, that school-yard mentality has a tough, tough, time going away.

Comparing yourself other guys’ success is also pointless.  I had a friend who could get every other night, but also had a 100K in debt and lived with his parents after getting fired from four consecutive jobs.

If you want advice from guys who’ve been out in the field, take it from guys you’ve been out in the field with and are not only good, but once used to be bad.  A natural won’t be able to break down what he did, the former AFC will.  

**Many, many instructors and master PUA’s are bullshit.**
There is absolutely NO real way to be credentialed in this stuff.  Some guy can easily memorize a book or video and repeat it verbatim.  During a bootcamp, 90% of instructors won’t even demo their own stuff in the field.  The best way is to look for actual referrals.

Also, many rely on “perceived value.”  They’ll say “If I charge $2,000, the student will believe that what they’re getting is worth that much more.”   Jewelry dealers rely on this for their business.  One dude once tried charging $1,000,000 for a bootcamp and probably could have gotten it from someone naïve enough.

Recently I ran into one of the more famous PUA’s in a bar and I watched him bomb (his name rhymes with “Hatador”). Basically, my buddy and I were able to hook the set he was trying to get and AMOGED him pretty easily, and we really weren’t trying to.

**Very few guys want soley to get laid, but they don’t know that yet.**
The carrot on the string for the PUA programs is pussy.  Pussy!  Pussy!  Get all the pussy you want!  It’s actually understandable.  Peer pressure, societal pressure, and the fact that sex is sex and it’s pretty damn awesome to begin with.

So… Great!  You score!  Now, where in the PUA handbook does it tell you to deal with the girl after you find out she’s a raging alcoholic and seriously needs help?  What about the where it tell how to deal with the single mom you met 30 minutes prior, who’s so desperate for attention that she brought you home while her teenaged daughter is in the house, fights with her daughter and starts crying in front of you?  Then there’s the abuse victim, and don’t forget the hoarder who’s house you can’t escape because you can’t find your clothes on the floor.

Those are some of my own experiences, and the point is that there’s a real person behind the sex, and the PUA community (for the most part) isn’t anywhere near prepared to teach you how to handle this stuff.  Some guys can look away from that kind of stuff and continue with the sex, and those guys are assholes.  Don’t be that asshole.


**If you find a girlfriend, you’re in a lot of danger of reverting back to your old self**
This is how it is for a lot relationships in general.  Just like how people get fat and lazy after relationship, many guys who’ve been through the PUA thing find themselves eventually becoming AFC’s.  The girl you met when you met her was being herself, you may not have been being yours.  Keeping your strong personality is something you need to work on and will only work if it’s genuine. 


**Not needing to get the girl is one of the ultimate successes**
Notice how I didn’t say not *wanting* to get the girl.  It’s not *needing* to get the girl.   Can you look at your life and truly say “I’m fine being single.”  Most here can, and most are lying to themselves.  You’ll know when you’re not lying to yourself anymore

No, I don't mean the emotional toll it takes on a man... I mean it's the incredibly easy way out of doing things.  We've all been there at some point in our lives, and sometimes revisit (shit, I've been dealing with it too as of late).  It's been making me think about the true causes of oneitis, and I firmly think it's because it is seriously the easiest option.



**Scarcity**


We all know that oneitis is caused by a scarcity mindset, and that in order to get over it, one really needs be living in an abundance mindset. For those who haven't, read [MaysonNSS's post on Scarcity vs Abundance](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/exd7y/scarcity_vs_abundance_how_neediness_kills_your/)

Now, it seems much easier to seek the attention from a girl who is showing you bits and pieces of attention, or you are just friends with than going up and cold approaching because you are already familiar with this girl.  You don't want to leave your comfort zone so you stay in this purgatory of friend zone AFC frustration, instead of going up and talking to some new girls.  Open 3 girls a DAY, and see if you are still all about this one after a month.


**Ego Based Oneitis**

This is something I never really heard talked about on here, but I honestly thinks is the stem of my oneitis... is ego based oneitis.  Looking back, I know I fucked up with this girl, so she friendzoned me.  I wasn't aggressive enough, and when I was, she did eventually reject me but throwing mad mixed signals.  I know that she hooked up with guys (hell, I even know guys who hooked up with her) and I had my chance, but I blew it.  

I am having a hard time getting over this, and I feel like if I slept with her once, I'd be good to go.  Guess what? That's pure ego talking.  I'm mad that I missed out on the opportunity, and beat myself up over it.  Furthermore, I can't stand the fact that it seems like every other guy has been successful with her.  

This is ego rearing it's ugly head, and could also be the source of oneitis.  Instead of treating her like a human, you are using her as some sort of notch in the bedpost type deal, making them the prize as your ego has been hurt. 

It's a shitty place to be, and I like to compare it to chasing losses in gambling.  Sometimes things don't fall into your favor, but you're just SURE if you have one more chance you can win the hand.  So you invest more, and you keep digging yourself deeper and deeper.  It comes to the point where she's just a reminder of your failures.

You just need to accept the fact that you messed up, and move on.  Try to take it as a learning experience.  I realize this is easier said than done (I'm still struggling with it), but you have to accept the fact that slipping up is part of the growing process.


**Leave The Comfort Zone**


The only way to get rid of oneitis is to leave your comfort zone.  if you acknowledge the fact that you are irrationally putting this girl on a pedestal, or admit that it was your ego that was hurt (this is not an easy thing to admit by the way) you're already a step ahead of many.  

Go out and talk to women, even if this means you need to go out solo.  There are many girls out there dying to meet you, you just need to go find them.  Don't deprive them of this while you sit around pining for one girl who doesn't see you the same way.

**The Cock-Blocking Girlfriend**

I'm finding myself in group settings a lot more than usual lately. After meeting up with a friend for wings, he invited me along to a party that he was heading to. Never wanting to turn down an opportunity to meet people, I agreed and we jumped into one car and went over.

Upon arrival, I recognized one or two faces, said hi to a few people, and then stepped back to see the group dynamics.

One technique that I often do at a house where I don't know too many people is to make broad jokes to the group, see who's receptive and start there. And that's just what I did.

There were two girls standing on the other side of a wooden table with writing on it. It appears to be tradition at this house to sign the party table.

The host, John, was brilliant. He had planned an Easter egg hunt for this party. A clever thing to do when hosting parties is to give an activity that is distracting. It causes people to bond and get to know each other without even noticing. I took notes for the next time I might host a party.

The hunt was a team scavenger hunt with clues and instead of eggs, we were finding small bottles of vodka, which we were to drink if we found them. Two people per team.

As John was explaining the rules, I caught the eyes of one of the girls standing opposite the table. I decided now would be a great opportunity to leave my mark on the party table.

She was watching as I took the marker that was lying there, and I started analyzing some of the drawings. One of the tidbits was a drawing of a three inch penis and under it the words ""This is John's Penis (Actual Size)."" I started to scribble down ""that's really not true at all."" and put an arrow pointing at the remark.

After making the mark I looked up and acted like I didn't know I was being watched. ""Oh, hah, yeah, it's really not that size at all. I've seen it."" I remarked.

She smiled and let out a surprisingly loud laugh. I was in.

I started to chat with her about the liquor hunt that was about to take place. ""You guys don't stand a chance,"" I joked. ""I am an expert at finding booze.""

She laughed, ""I don't think so. We're going to cheat. You're going down.""

""You want to make a wager?""

""Ok, what will it be."" She continued to smile.

""10 miniature bottles of vodka says I'll win.""

""I don't have 10 miniature bottles of vodka!"" She played along.

""You don't *yet*.""

She laughed as I put my hand out to shake. That's when the friend sprung into action.

""Don't touch my friend. She's not here for you."" Her friend chided with a nasty tone as she grabbed the cute girls arm away from my handshake. There was no humor in her voice. She was unimpressed with me. Worse, she was unimpressed that her friend had been so friendly. *That is simply not the way of pretty women*, I imagined this girl thinking, *you can't flirt with this guy*.

""She's not here for me? Why is she here?"" I asked.

The bitchy one had an ugly look of disgust on her face as she tried to answer the simple question I posed.

""She's here for me."" she replied.

""Oh.. I get it. Please go on... I've already got a half-chub just thinking about this..."" In some contexts this statement wouldn't have been received well, but it was said light-heartedly and although I didn't get any laughs from the bitch friend, I did get laughs from the cute girl and a few guys who overheard the conversation.

And then we were off. The doors were opened and the battle began.

One great advantage to gaming in groups/parties is the dynamics regularly subject people to you. At a bar, if a girl is not initially impressed, you've got a count-down timer in your head trying to break through the shield or make a girl laugh. It's all or nothing, and it's difficult to re-approach despite your outcome.

Groups and parties are different. You can wear people down. Talk to people, take a break, revisit twenty minutes later. This ebb and flow of conversation engenders a feeling like you've known each other longer. Done properly, by the second or third conversation, she'll be warmed up and talk to you like one in her inner circle.

I was teamed up with my friend as we wandered the property searching for the tiny bottles of vodka, but we kept bumping into the girls. Every time we bumped into them I made sure to make a short clever comment. The goal was an evening-long play. If she saw me in my best form as I made funny comments to people in passing, it would be her understanding that this is how I am in general- not just to impress her. It's a subtle suggestion to make, but it's effective.

""Oh hey you two! Did you get the clue about Bug's Bunny's favorite phrase?"" I pointed at the hint sheet for the scavenger hunt.

""Yeah, that one's easy!"" the cute girl replied.

""I know! It's simple! 'I don't do Mondays!' like, duh, that was too easy."" I joked. (This reference is actually from the new Looney Tunes show where Daffy doesn't know Bugs' catchphrase.)

",173,20,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/r53in/fr_this_is_a_minifr_but_its_mostly_a_thank_you_to/,"I would hardly say that I'm the only former AFC that was initially very put off by this subreddit when I first came across it, which was some time ago. At least a year. I first subscribed to it because, hey, I could use some improvement in my love life. 

Then I started reading FR's. Successful ones. And it filled me with a sense of jealousy and bitterness that I wasn't getting results like that. What the fuck? I'm funny, smart. What's up? Eventually the rhetoric started to wear on me. I didn't get all the terms and it seemed like such a game (it is, but I didn't *get it* yet) and I was just generally offended at the whole notion. So I unsubscribed. 

What I've recently come to realize though is that what this subreddit is about is improving the quality of your interactions with *everyone,* not just women. At base, it's nothing more than confidence building. 

We call the place seddit but after awhile, and I think a lot of people would agree with me, that closing women almost comes to be more of a by-product of an increase in confidence. Almost more of a perk, than anything. 

But you have to try. You have to practice and *that's* what I didn't understand before. Those FR's that would just piss me off were the product of practice and I didn't appreciate that at the time. So I worked on it. Diligently. Got blown out more than a few times and it's true what you say, that the more rejects I go through, the easier it gets. 

So I'd like to submit my first FR. Nothing fancy but a huge victory in my eyes. 

**FR:**

I met HB7 in class so this has been a slow, ongoing process in attraction-building but I've been very conscious about avoiding the friendzone at all costs. To make a long story short, I invited her out for the recent holiday and she agreed. 

I made sure I didn't get hammered. I've embarrassed myself on first dates before due to not watching my intake and that was the last thing I wanted. By the time she showed up, I was in great spirits. I left my friends and did the solo thing. 

I made sure to always have an answer. To lead the way, so to speak. The most awkward conversation you can have with a girl is when neither of you can decide on a place to go because neither one is willing to propose an idea that the other person doesn't like. 

In other words, when she asked ""where do you want to go?"" I made sure never to answer ""I don't care, where do *you* want to go?"" Women want you to take the lead. So we went to a couple bars and I made brilliant eye contact and really, my ultimate goal was just to make sure she didn't stop laughing.

Not much of an FR, I know, but a roaring success for me. 

And it's strange, it's now that I would normally start developing the early stages of one-itis, that dreaded malady.

You don't. Seduction can only help you become more attractive to women in general, and cannot cause one specific girl to reciprocate your feelings. This is known in the community as having ""one-itis"", and when you have it, game will be pointless.

If you ask seddit for help with one specific girl for whom you obviously have one-itis, you will be downvoted mercilessly. There is no saving you, as long as you have the mindset that there is only one girl for you in the whole world.

[Mouthpiece drops some mad wisdom on a one-itis sufferer](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/eq77s/good_friends_with_this_girl_about_7_years_but/c1a2dx7), and [LesbianPUA preaches to the choir](
http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/eii7u/seddit_is_not_about_helping_you_get_one_specific/).

**What do the HB numbers mean?**

HB is short for ""hot babe"" or ""honey bunny"", and is a scale for rating girls by appearance. It is used to determine how to game a particular girl...not how much you want her.

[sockthepuppetry explains ""presented appearance"" and how it applies to the HB scale](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e46vd/can_we_get_our_numbers_sorted_ie_how_do_we_define/c155hkd)

**How should I tell a girl I like her?**

You shouldn't. [You should show her, and build attraction so she likes you](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e873a/how_do_i_show_her_how_i_feel_about_her/).

Also, [numerous seddit regulars chimed in on this discussion and a neophyte comes closer to enlightenment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e6zi5/should_i_straightup_say_i_really_do_like_you/)

**Am I too old for this?**

[No.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/escx0/am_i_too_old_to_start/)

**I want a longterm relationship, rather than casual flings. Can game help me?**

Of course. Attractive is always attractive, and attraction is vital for *any* kind of relationship with the opposite sex. Seduction and pickup is about becoming more attractive to more people. Many sedditors are here to [learn to be better, more attractive partners or husbands](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ea85o/a_challenge_to_seddit_advice_for_married_faithful/). Others have had success finding [long term relationships with the help of seddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/eqt88/just_a_thankyou_to_seddit_for_helping_me_land_a/).

**Is it worth it?**

[Yes, or maybe no.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e7zyg/is_it_worth_it/)

**Does it work?**

[Yes, by some definition of ""works"", and for people who put in the effort and practice](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e43af/how_many_of_the_people_who_have_managed_to_turn/). If you practice anything, you cannot help but get better at it, and attracting the opposite sex is no different. There are no magic words or secret techniques that will make women sleep with you, but there are attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs that you can cultivate that will make you more attractive to the opposite sex.

**I'm in the friend zone, how do I get out?**

You probably don't. It's easier and quicker to meet and attract a new girl, than to climb out of the pit that is the friend zone. Live and learn, and don't walk into the friend zone in the future.

[The best way to get out of the friend zone is to never step into it](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/dkmk7/how_do_i_avoid_the_ljbf_zone/).

**How do I flirt via text, email, or facebook?**

You probably don't. Text is a very limited channel, where it is nearly impossible to build attraction, and very easy to lose it. The more you say via text before you sleep with her, the greater your odds of losing the girl.

[Mouthpiece waxed poetic about text game](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e645m/text_game_how_to_improve/), [cheddarchexmix explained why friending on facebook is the path to the friendzone](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e7ffa/dont_friend_girls_youre_interested_in/), and [7PUA seeks guidance on his verbose texting style and learns to not talk so much](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ecbn3/fr_texting_game/).

On the other side of the debate, [Delightful_white believes facebook can be a useful part of your game if used correctly and in moderation](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e9rs5/delightful_whites_guide_to_facebook_game/).

**How do I deal with flakes?**

[Hotwir3 seeks answers to this question of the ages](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/dwaz0/ladies_this_pisses_men_off/).

**I'm a straight woman, can learning about seduction help me attract men?**

[Yes, with some caveats](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/bxca2/what_can_a_girl_do_about_pickup/). Men and women process attraction very differently. Many of the strongest elements of game work just as well on men. That said, seducing men is not a typical part of the conversation around here, and the level of knowledge this community possesses on the subject is small.

**I'm a lesbian or bi woman, or a gay guy, how about me?**

Game works mostly the same for women picking up women and men picking up gay men. Approach it the same way as a straight man learning game, and adjust based on experience.

**What's the deal with ""negs""? Why do you go around insulting girls?**

The neg is perhaps the most misunderstood technique in seduction, and you'll find very few sedditors use the term, though they still use the technique to one degree or another. [A neg is not an insult](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/d8vds/on_negs_the_goal_isnt_to_be_an_asshole_or/), and the response should be laughter and not discomfort or embarrassment. [Girls use a form of neg much more frequently and aggressively than guys do, which the PUA/seduction literature refers to as ""shit tests""](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/eo3q4/til_that_a_man_negging_is_analgous_to_a_woman/). Let's all say it together: [A neg is not an insult](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/anldy/reminder_insulting_is_not_negging/).

**Can we talk about cool openers?**

[You don't need new openers](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/egqs4/too_much_focus_on_openers/). ""How's it going?"" Is a perfectly acceptable opener. Don't let not having something clever to open with prevent you from talking to someone you're interested in. Canned material is a useful prop in the beginning; it's training wheels to help you get past your approach anxiety. Learn about opinion openers and situational openers, and start practicing. Improvement comes from practice, not memorization.

**Seduction only works on dumb girls with low self esteem!**

That's not a question. And incorrect. Attraction is not a choice, and smart girls like confident, assertive men just as much as the dumb ones with low self esteem, maybe moreso.

**I've read [New to seddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ero8h/new_to_seddit_a_concise_guide_for_recovering_afcs/), and all of the linked discussions. What else should I read?**

Less than you think. Reading, without practice, will not be very useful. It is entirely possible to ""know"" lots of stuff, but be terrible in the real world. The general consensus among sedditors who've made it through to the other side (where ""the other side"" means, ""able to meet and attract high quality women with regularity""), is that reading one or two beginner books is all you really need to get started. Reading more books, beyond the basics, will probably do less for your game than one night out in the field. More valuable, is getting into the field, trying things, and then reporting back to your peers here at seddit in the form of field reports and questions about your stumbling points.

Some well-respected commercial beginner materials are *Magic Bullets*, *Double Your Dating* and David Wygant's video series. *The Game* is considered a good overview of what learning pickup looks like and the overall gestalt of pickup, though it is not structured as a teaching tool. Online there are some decent free materials, like [*The Book of Pook*](http://www.scribd.com/doc/3536110/The-Book-of-Pook). There are hundreds of sites on the web devoted to seduction and pickup...but at least 90% of them are incredibly spammy and of questionable value and integrity.

In all cases, take what feels good to you, experiment with the ideas and techniques. There is no college degree or certification in seduction, so all ""experts"" are self-proclaimed. Their opinion may not necessarily be gospel, and the opinion of one ""expert"" may conflict with others.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_estpo,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/estpo/frequently_asked_questions/,
1354004457.0,155,self.seduction,13v5qd,[FR] Stewardess on a 30-hour layover,187,32,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/13v5qd/fr_stewardess_on_a_30hour_layover/,"A few months back I went through an online dating phase and exchanged contact info with an Asian HB9 flight attendant. We had a few entertaining conversations via text, but it eventually died out. A week ago, she texted me saying that she'll be in my city for 30 hours on a layover and asked if I wanted to meet up. I said yes and then ceased texting until the day before our date to work out logistics (AFC me probably would've sent unnecessary texts in the meantime and come across as needy, killing attraction prematurely).

Date night: I waited for her in the hotel lobby, gave her a hug and complimented her outfit when she came down, and continued the kino with a hand on her back as we walked to a restaurant nearby. Dinner was light-hearted, pretty effortless conversation. I played the Neil Strauss ""Five Lies"" game, teased her for losing and told her to buy me a drink later.

While we were eating I suggested going out to a salsa club afterwards and she agreed, on the condition that I wouldn't make her dance (shit test?) ... When we got there I sat down and rested my leg against hers as we watched the other dancers. After a few minutes I grabbed her hand and told her to come with me so I could ""show her something,"" and we went to a more private area where I could teach her some basic dance steps -- a kino goldmine. She begged me not to make her dance in front of other people but I kept it playful and didn't push too hard.

We left to check out a quiet, classy bar where she bought my drink, and I started the ""questions"" game (ask any question, answer honestly, and every question must be unique). This allowed me to turn things a little more sexual, ask about her turn-ons and whatnot. I put my arm around her shoulder, caressed her lightly, leaned in and told her how good her hair smelled, and took the chance to get closer to her. The five hours we had spent together flew by, and we took a taxi back to her hotel. I asked to use her bathroom (ha) and we watched some HBO before making out until sunrise. Serious LMR put the brakes on anything too sexual but it did not matter to me at all; she's the most attractive girl I've ever dated and it sounds like we will continue seeing each other whenever she's in town.

I won't lie, I'm still fairly new at this, but this is a subject that has plagued my dating life for a long time. Thanks to Seddit and general life experiences, I've finally managed to learn what this is and isn't. I'm hoping that this thread will clear up some misconceptions and illuminate some pitfalls.

Now, obviously, If all you want is to go out, have a good time, and nail lots of chicks, this post probably isn't for you, but I think there's something everyone can draw from this thread.

**WHAT ONEITIS IS**

Oneitis is when you find yourself pining over a single woman who is unobtainable. You hold her up as a pinnacle as all you hold beautiful in this world, and refuse to acknowledge, or even actively deny other opportunities that come up. These opportunities can be other women, but they can also be things like Job Offers, Vacations, going out with friends, etc. The rationale behind this is almost always, ""I'm just waiting for her to come around"", or some variation there of. Fuck that! She isn't responsible for your happiness! YOU ARE! So get out there and do something about it!

In a nutshell, Oneitis is putting the pussy on the pedestal. There's no two ways about it. It's a complete lack of focus on yourself and your own interests; you put all of your energy into a woman that has no intent to reciprocate. Knock it off.


* ""itis"" is a suffix used to denote a pathological issue. The actual, technical details are not important, but keep this in mind: ""itis"" means something bad.

* 99% of Oneitis cases are ex-post-facto, meaning that it happens after the fact. You've made a play for a girl, failed, and now you're caught up on her.

* This is bad because you're focusing your energies on a girl that you cannot obtain. It screws with your inner game, fucks up your priorities, and can even lead to depression in severe cases.

* Oneitis keeps you from functioning at your peak. You're funneling energy into a black hole. This is energy that you should be putting into meeting other women, pursuing a passion, or just enjoying life.

* In the rare case that you develop Oneitis while dating a girl, it can cloud your vision. If you're dating a girl that doesn't really match up with you, and you actively turn away or tune out other girls that match up much better with your values, personality, etc, you have Oneitis. if anything comes of your efforts with the current girl, it will crash and burn in a spectacular way, and you'll be kicking yourself for not admitting to yourself that it wasn't a good match and missing out on all those other girls that now have boyfriends.

**WHAT ONEITIS IS NOT**

* Oneitis is not simply dating one girl at a time. Some people prefer the simplicity. You don't have to let down anyone else if things work out, You don't have to keep likes and dislikes straight, and you can focus your energy on one person at a time.

* Oneitis is not wanting or pursuing an LTR. 

* Oneitis is not being in a closed relationship.

* Oneitis is not having stronger feelings for one girl over another, (unless you're not actively dating her).


**here's what fellow Sedditor nycprowl has to say on the subject**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;**ONEITIS IS NOT THE SAME THING AS INTIMACY**

&gt;This seems to be the biggest issue newbies seem to have a hard time wrapping their head around. Because you're into a girl, and she's into you...it's NOT ONEITIS. That's called developing a healthy relationship. Seddit and PUA material doesn't teach you to shun these feelings, on the contrary. Seddit provides the skills to help get you to that point if that's what you're looking for.

&gt;When people here say ""kill off oneitis"", they mean the unrequited love bullshit. The incredibly needy, ""but she's the only one for me"" type of feelings when THOSE FEELINGS ARE NOT RETURNED. Again, if the feelings are mutual, you don't have oneitis and you don't have to become all closed off if you're looking for a girlfriend. It only becomes a problem when the girl has rejected you or you've friendzoned yourself, and you can't get past her... meanwhile she is not interested in being with you.

&gt;Please, don't confuse a healthy mutual desire to be with someone and the neediness of oneitis, it'll fuck you over. I know people who've been around already know this, but with the response of the post in question, it's obvious that the topic is one that confuses some. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**WHY IT MATTERS**

In the second thread I linked to above, I think that does a pretty good job of clearly demonstrating this. The OP lost out on something potentially good because he was afraid of developing Oneitis, when there really was no danger at all. This situation was the result of a tragic misunderstanding. If you're reading this, I feel for you dude, and all I can say is to keep on going and don't let it happen again; You know what you want now. There's nothing to be ashamed of, =)

There's no shame in wanting an LTR, there's nothing wrong with having feelings for someone. What IS wrong, is getting hung up on a single girl that you have no realistic chance with, and passing up other awesome women and depriving said women of an awesome guy. It's selfish and inconsiderate on multiple levels.

Hell, even if you just start off wanting to get laid, and unless you have explicitly laid out the parameters of your relationship beforehand as a FWB/FB arrangement, If you develop feelings for a girl along the way, THAT'S OKAY!


I guess I've said all of that to say this:

Emotions themselves are like guns; inert and have no power to act in and of themselves: It's what we do with them that matters. Emotion gives us passion, passion gives us confidence. Avoiding emotion will get you nowhere. Instead, temper it and forge it into something productive. It's your control, not your lack, of emotion that makes you attractive. There's a time and a place for everything. Come out and say what you want; playing it safe is not going to get you what you want. You have to take risks to find happiness and success. This applies to everything, not just dating.

**in closing:**

* Be honest with yourself about what you want. If you want to fuck girls and have One night stands, do that. If you want a relationship, don't be afraid to start one if the offer comes up, or to make your own offer. If you don't know what you want, then consider taking some time off to seriously consider your motives. You'll have a more positive impact on your life and the lives of those around you.

* Be honest with others. If you just want casual sex, make that clear from the get go. Don't string other's along. If you want a relationship, don't string yourself along. 

* If you change your mind about either one of these, that's perfectly fine. Just make sure to keep everyone involved informed of what's going on. If you all of a sudden just want to bang, Stringing girls on is a huge dick move, and there's no surefire way of developing oneitis than to keep sleeping with a girl you've developed feelings for that she will never reciprocate.

* leash your emotions, don't euthanize them. Like I said above, emotions are an integral part of the human experience. Don't be afraid to let them out, but know how far to let them go.

So I started quietly upping my game a couple months back with an emphasis on improving my social business skills.  So far, the training has paid dividends professionally and socially, but I've hit a fascinating wall...

I can't get people to ask me questions or hold up a conversation, anymore.  I feel like I'm stuck in this weird hell where nobody I sit down with knows how to form a thought unless they're asked a question, and they don't have the comprehensive ability to elaborate without prompting.  Everything about their nonverbal cues suggests that they're engaged, sometimes even aroused, but when I engage them, it's more like a Q +A session than a conversation.

Have I simply worked them to the point of breaking?  How do I get out of this one-sided loop so I can start enjoying my social dates, again?

They are not good at making conversation which makes others feel comfortable(rapport). This happens by asking questions about the other person.

Yes, you are doing something wrong if you are not happy with your dating life. I'm aware that changes are difficult and challenging. If you want success, you must work on it everyday with no days off, every time you go out. Its like building muscles, won't happen overnight, but will happen if you stick to it.

Guys are always trying to figure out the significance of what she's saying.  This is the answer to *all* those posts:


**ALWAYS ASSUME ATTRACTION**


Let's say she says something and you're not sure what it means, whether she's into you or not.  Two possible scenarios here:


**Scenario 1:  She's into you.**

Don't sweat it bro, she's into you.  If you worry about whether or not she's into you here, she may pick up on your self doubt and lose interest.  It's really easy to kill attraction once you have it by making the wrong move.  If you're not confident that you're good enough for her, why would she be confident that you're good enough for her?


**Scenario 2:  She's not into you**

But she's still talking to you, so you may still have a chance.  If you assume she's attracted, you could actually turn things around and build attraction.  Act as if she's into you, and she may just be.

And if she's just not into you, and will never be into you, then you got nothing to lose by assuming attraction.  Worst case you're wrong, and in most cases girls like to hang out with confident guys more than insecure guys.  Making a move on a girl who shuts you down is actually not all that bad, and she'll usually respect you for it, as long as you take it in stride.  The thing that girls hate is when she shuts a guy down and he sulks about it and complains.  If you smile and say ""ok, cool"" and just move on, then you've probably gained a lot more respect by her than if you'd never made a move at all.


So.  If she replies, then she's into you.  If she ignores you, then she's playing hard to get.  ;)",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_i6g1d,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/i6g1d/for_all_the_guys_who_ask_what_does_this_mean_or/,

Passive Value is one of my most favorite aspects of the game. For those of you that don’t know what I’m talking about, passive value is the value that you display before you begin actively gaming a woman.

This is the 360-degree display of your value that is developed beforehand (or faked in-field IF you’re still in the training wheels phases of learning newbiedom), making the amount of game you have to run significantly less.

It incorporates:
* Subcommunication
* Body Language
* Fashion
* Social Proof
* Lifestyle
* Status

Think about celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio; all they have to do is exist in a club and women will be attracted to them. Why? Because they have proven their worth through their accomplishments (film, TV, music, etc.) and the popularity, wealth, and power that comes from those accomplishments is public knowledge, thereby making them (through their passive value) extremely attractive.

Of course, we’re not all super-famous celebrities, so we have to do a bit more work in order to NOT look like a:

* Creep
* Stalker
* Predator

or worse:

* A lonely and desperate guy!

This includes proper body language, proper attire, and other simple, but important, elements. Whenever I’m out with my students, I spend quite a bit of time focusing on this because I believe that it can truly make or break your opener.

Without further ado, I’m going to highlight three things that you don’t think about when you’re out on a sarge and give you ways to fix them so that you can appear nonchalant, fun, and interesting to the women you’re about to approach and hopefully NOT creepy.

**#1: Stop Leaning Against The Bar**

Again, something that guys are NOTORIOUS for doing and one of the primary things that makes a guy look like a predator. If you were there to have fun with your friends, why are you scanning the crowd, looking for something? You wouldn’t be.

You would be smiling and laughing with your friend(s), telling great stories and not caring about everyone around you. Watch how girls interact with their friends and learn from it. Remember that your wing should be the most fun and interesting person in your life (or PRETEND he is) and, that way, when a girl gives you the casual walk-by, your “Hey, quick question. My friend and I were just talking about…” will seem realistic.

Believe it or not, girls do think,

“No, you weren’t. You’ve been standing there looking at the crowd for 10 minutes.”

Solution: Squaring off (i.e. bodies directly facing each other), parallel to the bar, will make you look like you just ordered a drink and got caught up in conversation. Square off with your wing and tell some funny stories to pass the time. I’ll tell you how to keep an eye out for the hotties next, but stay fun, light-hearted and engaged. Women want to meet guys that have better things to do than pick up girls (ironically), so show them that you’re not there to pick up girls (even if you are) by having fun with your wing in the interim.

Exception: Here’s a quote by our long term training coach Gareth Jones,

“Do not lean up against the bar unless you are talking to a girl, in which case you should nothing BUT lean up against the bar.”

**#2: Stop Looking Around**

This is HUGE for me, and something I always have to hammer into the heads of my students. When you look around, you look like a lone predator out to get laid, not like the guy that’s out to have fun with his friends. You know when you see that girl all by herself, looking around and it sets off that “GO GET HER!” instinct in your head?

Yeah, girls see it, too, but it sets off their “That guy is a predator or creep” instinct, instead. When you’re looking around for girls to open, all the girls you’re ignoring because they’re with their boyfriends are seeing you looking like a predator and are putting you in the “Wouldn’t” category. Maybe you don’t care about them, but when they point you out to their single friend that just came back from the bathroom, you’ve just blown yourself out of that set.

Solution: Use your peripheral vision to spot targets: Look over his shoulder, while he looks over yours then, when your target is spotted, you can make your move straight away. You can even have him spot targets for you, or the other way around.

**#3: Stop Being Too Cool for School (ie Asian Poker Face)**

Again, one of the most important things I teach. For any of you that have taken a program with us, you know that we are beasts about forcing you to smile. I could rattle off facts about endorphins being released when you smile, thus making you feel better, or about how smiling at a woman causes her to smile at you, which makes you more attractive to every other woman (!!), but I’m not gonna.

I’m simply going to ask how you can tell if a guy is having fun with his friend(s) at a bar and how you can tell that he’s confident, at ease, and comfortable: His Smile. Exactly.

The point of passive value is to show that your default (non-creepy) personality is attractive to a woman and, since we all know that confidence is the most attractive quality about a man, our job is to show that we’re confident in every method that we can. Who’s more confident: the guy threatening to pound on some dude, or the one smiling, telling him to relax? Who’s more confident: the guy with a frown on his face, alone at the bar, or the guy with a smile, chatting with his buddy? Exactly.

Solution: Smile. Just do it. In times of crippling fear or overwhelming uncertainty: smile. In boring or underwhelming times: smile. In times of extreme anger: Smile. If you’re still having trouble, just say the word, “COOKIES!” or “YEAH!”

Saying the words themselves will force you to form a smile. BAM said the lady!

There you go! Those are the three most common detractors from passive value that I run into over and over again. Take this article to heart, because it has the power to transform the success (and the fun) that you have in the club.

1358130687.0,153,self.seduction,16iz1y,"State, dopamine, and becoming more alpha",208,55,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16iz1y/state_dopamine_and_becoming_more_alpha/,"I learned about the concept of state in the context of pick-up a while back, and I've had some thoughts kicking around in my head lately, so here goes:

**What it is:** ""State"" is a feeling of flow and resourcefulness in which you are outside of your head and have good energy. Hard to describe. The best metaphor I can think of, is that it's like a light-bulb turns on. Things feel different, like you have access to more of your brain. Fear and apathy diminish if they were there previously. But more than anything, I would say that *motivation* is increased.

**How does it help?** Being more motivated, having diminished inhibitions, and having your brain in a resourceful state to back you up can be amazing. Think of your best moments in life: conversations and interactions you owned (were funny, energetic, etc), job interviews, sports plays, academic tests, stretches during creative work, etc. 

Focusing on the latter, from experience my writing feels almost unreal when I'm in state. Like when I review it later, it's almost like it's not even me who's writing it. Especially when compared to my ""having a bad day"" writings. When I write in state, it's like being in a trance and everything just flows out ever so perfectly. 

**Really though, what is state?** I'm a logical person. I hate wishy-washy pseudoscience and frankly that's what this post has sounded like so far. I believe state is correlated with a strong release of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which has been linked to pleasure, and more recently, motivation, in humans and animals. You get a spike of dopamine after a good meal; about twice as much after sex; and 3-4 times that of sex when you do a line of coke (I'll talk about implications in a bit). *EDIT - there is more than dopamine going on chemically; norepinephrine is also probably there, as are others, so just keep in mind when I say ""dopamine"" I'm referring to a variety of neurotransmitters that have upper effects*

I think we evolved to naturally release dopamine in certain scenarios to increase our resourcefulness and effectiveness as human beings. Seduction should definitely be one of them; women are wooed by wit and charisma, and what better way to do this than to have your mind in a state of flow? To be able to take something she just said, link it to something you remember from X years ago, and make a witty joke? To have the audacity to physically pick her up and move her around for fun. You get the idea! Now think if you've ever done those kind of actions when you were feeling like shit; a good opposite scenario is the ""morning fog"" us non-morning people experience. 

**How can I get in state?** Good question, I hope you guys have a ton of feedback here we can all use! I'll start with some prerequisites: live a healthy lifestyle. Get enough sleep, do 30-45 mins of exercise multiple times a week, and eat a balanced diet - high protein foods should help because certain amino acids are precursors to dopamine, and AAs come from protein. 

Now, actual things I/we can do. When in a really shit state on my own, a bit of exercise can actually snap me out of it temporarily. Yes, drop and do a set of push-ups. Something else: when I read something I find very interesting or exciting. I like thinking about my work because I'm very passionate about it. Ok, so what about at the club or bar? I find humor to be good. This is where some routines can help - have something you can say to your friends or even open a set with, that you yourself find funny and maybe can get others to laugh. 

A big thing for me is to *force conversation*. I am an introvert; that doesn't mean I don't like talking to people, it just means that it requires much more energy for me than it does extroverts to whom it's natural. When I force conversation, and don't have any anxiety by focusing on an outcome, it's like I'm revving up my brain. I just saw a really good post on here that reiterated something I sorta do: ""nouning"". Start off a conversation, listen to their response, focus on one of the nouns they use, and say something about that noun. Here's the link to the post in question: http://www.puaforums.com/how-flirt/3736-simple-art-conversation.html

Perhaps the most important part is *momentum*. Working up. I was at a dinner dance the other night, sitting around feeling like shit for two hours. So eventually I got up, and started small - some smalltalk with a few people I hadn't seen in a while. Then I grabbed a bro around me and I said, ""Hey we're gonna go find some girls to talk to"". So we walk around, not getting much done, until eventually we're dancing around some chicks and I tap one on the arm and introduce myself (to be fair I was trying to set a good example). Bam. It was over. Rest of the night went amazing. 

I should mention that I think there are bad ways to get into state. Everything I've talked about so far has been more or less natural. Have you ever recovered so perfectly from morning fog with a well-timed coffee? There you go - stimulants get you into state. I don't want to say coffee is bad I just want to draw a point: when you're in the club, you could just as well do a line of coke than put in the effort to have interactions which naturally get you going; and of course, the highs will be of different quality. 

This is one reason people in this community adopt the rule ""No drugs until you're in state"". Because once you get there, you won't need the drugs.

**Why do these things get me into state?** Let's start with stimulants, that's easy. Chemicals create chemicals which affect your brain - if you want anything more than that, seek out a chemist or wikipedia. I think people on /r/seduction are more interested in the natural activities. 

A quick detour which will help lead to my thesis: there are many studies stating that alpha males of tribes have more dopamine. They are the winners: they have taken risks, been rewarded, and the cycle only continues. 

Think about something like humor. Who can afford to joke around and have a good time often, those stressed out beta males trying to find a job who worry about what their parents and friends are thinking about them? Doubt it. So my theory is this: *when you can concentrate really hard with your conscious mind and take actions that an alpha male would take, eventually the rest of your brain plays along and gives you the chemicals you need.* Why would your brain do this? Because it's in your interest to increase resourcefulness in a situation where you have the opportunity to procreate, i.e. make sexy-time. See the link I posted at the bottom for a related study on potential reward/dopamine correlations. 

Why do I think something like humor can be alpha? It's the opposite state of stress, and in the old times it was the kings and high court being entertained by jesters and drinks, making jokes, having a good time, while the peasants worried about the roof over their head. *Which group do you think a girl would be drawn towards back then?*   

Another action that's very different from humor which I think would have the same effect is setting personal boundaries. You're at the bar with a mixed group of friends. One of your friends starts cracking jokes about some mental condition. You get all serious, stand up, and look them dead in the eye: ""Hey, I know people who are like that, it's not a joking matter. Cut that shit out."" ""But isn't it really funny how they always - "" ""Shut the fuck up Jimmy."" Now you sit back down and cut the tension by changing topics to something of your choosing. You know what kind of people don't tolerate shit they don't like? Of course you do. Ever done something similar to this and felt that pump you get from seizing status and control? Don't forget to have a one-on-one talk with Jimmy later to stay friends though. 

**Ways to increase dopamine in general?** I've got a few ideas. For one, don't waste your state! Like, don't get excited and stimulated from watching porn, browsing facebook, or doing other unproductive bullshit. I am not sure if ""state"" as we've been calling it is a limited resource, but I at least feel that after an amazing night it's extra hard to recover the next day if I've been in heavy state. I also talked about the natural sleep/exercise/diet trifecta which should really be more important to you than something you shrug off just because everyone says it. I'm also generally against stimulants - even caffeine. I think these can be short-term performance enhancers to use occasionally, yes, but I think it's important you train your *baseline* (i.e. practice getting into state, maintaining it, managing it, etc) rather than relying on stimulants.

**What about testosterone?** I found a really good quote online that summarizes my present mental model on the relationship between T and what we've discussed:

""While testosterone creates the drive for status, dominance, and winning, it is dopamine that allows a man achieve these things. It is dopamine that creates the hedonistic, pleasure seeking bad boy. It is dopamine that creates the extroverted, social, charmer. It is dopamine that creates the competitive, aggressive corporate hard-charger.""

**Other thoughts and implications.** There's this effect I feel sometimes (which I alluded to above) that arises from state mismatches. When you are in state, do something great, then reflect upon it later or try to do it again, it can almost feel like *this is not me*. That was *someone else* who did those things. I experience this with quite a few of my interactions with others - sometimes I just leave such a good impression that I feel I simply can't follow up. This creates a fair bit of anxiety and nervousness unfortunately. 

You feel like you always have to be ""on"", you gotta ""get in state no matter what"", but of course trying to force it like this cannot work. In my experience, your good state *must* come from a stress-free place. And oftentimes this is no easy feat. Alpha males are outcome-independent, but clearly you are reaching for an outcome here, so... Something's gotta give. Perhaps over time your *baseline state* (and thus chemical levels) mature to something more desirable as you gain more life experience and your brain - your subconscious brain - starts to realize that. 

Like everything worthwhile in life, I'm afraid there's probably no silver bullet - just long-term conditioning over a period of time to slowly improve yourself.

At the end of the day, the thought I want to end with is this: you need to take action of some sort to affect any change, whether it's short-term entering of state, or long-term ""alpha conditioning"" as I alluded to above. 

I very much look forward to hearing your feedback, and I hope you enjoyed my ramblings.

I own my body, because this is MY fucking body, and you might have one that's better shaped but you can't rock yours better than me. Because I'm fucking awesome, and as far as I'm concerned, I'm the sexiest motherfucker on this planet.

Today I will put on whatever the fuck I think looks cool and walk out the door with a big fucking grin on my face. I'm going to say hi to that old lady with the dog and give a sly grin at the hunny walking down the street. Do I look creepy? Who the fuck cares, I'm **me**. I'm gonna walk into class/work with that same fucking grin like I just got laid by Jennifer Lopez. I'm gonna say hi to the prof/boss and all the students/co-workers. Then I'm gonna go plop myself down next to that cute girl I've always wanted to talk to and introduce myself. It won't matter what the fuck I say, because I'm fucking awesome -- I can say whatever the fuck I want it'll sound cool. And if she's cold to me?

Sure, the rest of the world might disagree -- but they're depressed little drones, while we're mindlessly happy, and the happy, care-free and joyous reality will always win over those around.

Go forth, be the kings of your fucking domain, don't give the slightest fuck what anyone says because they're projecting their own insecurities on you (in other words, they're regurgitating the self-defeating talk they give to themselves when they want to let loose but are too afraid to).

So shove a toothpick in your mouth, wear that rediculous hat you love and rock out with your cocks out guns a blazing because the world is your oyster, *and don't let anybody tell you otherwise*.

1346010214.0,149,self.seduction,yv5rl,"Beginners Tip: If it's boring, leave. Don't wait for her.",175,26,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yv5rl/beginners_tip_if_its_boring_leave_dont_wait_for/,"So I thought I would share a very helpful little tip for beginners such as myself. Most of you seduction pros already know this. I am a recovering ""Nice Guy"" and a former AFC. I have made a lot of progress so far in trying to become more alpha with the help of this forum and other seduction forums. I have to say, one of the most helpful tips I have learned through my experiences so far is to **NOT WAIT AROUND.**

Lets say you're out at the club or a party or something. The cute girl you are interested in is also there. She may have even invited you out that night. One thing you have to remember is that you cannot make it seem like that was your only option for the night. If she appears to be ignoring you.. or being a bitch to you.. **DO NOT** sit there and wait around like a chump, hoping that maybe just maybe you'll get to hook up that night. 

If you aren't having fun.. if its boring... just leave! The girl WILL sense that you aren't having a good time and she will lose respect for you that you choose to stay. Show her that you are the prize and that you have other options! Don't be a dick about it. Just walk up to her, smile, and say you got a text from some friends and you're gonna check out some other place tonight.

In the last week I have done this twice to a HB9 that I used to wait around for. The results have been incredible. Recently whenever she sees me shes me she won't leave me alone. Asking me how that other party was or how that one club was and if it had fun, ect. ect. She's also texted me twice this week asking if I was going out that night!

So to recap: Just make sure YOU are having fun. If you aren't, show her you have options. Politely leave and find something better.

**TL;DR: If you're out with a girl at a party/club and she's not showing you attention, don't wait up for her. Show her you have options and politely leave. You are the prize. Not her.**",,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,,,True,t3_yv5rl,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yv5rl/beginners_tip_if_its_boring_leave_dont_wait_for/,
1343314333.0,156,self.seduction,x6wnc,I'm living in Korea.  The game here is totally different from what I know. Enlighten PUA's in East Asia. ,210,54,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x6wnc/im_living_in_korea_the_game_here_is_totally/,"I'm living in Korea for the next six months for a study abroad exchange program.  I'm doing the usual 'talk to everyone, be confident, and be friendly' mentality that I do in the United States.  At first I thought things were going awesome, I was getting numbers, texting, and yesterday a Korean girl even asked me out on a date (or so I thought, details laters).  

From what I've learned is that most korean girls smile if they make eye contact with me, and I take this as an invitation into conversation; a couple minutes later of solid game and I got a phone number.  I eject and begin text game.  Typical text game is not working however, I don't even get flakes anymore.  I either get no response or an excuse whenever I ask them to hang out.  

Also yesterday a girl pulled me aside after class and asked me to go to a baseball game with her sister and he friend.  I have only talked to this girl twice before and am a bit shocked but accept (this is the first time a girl has ever asked me out).  Anyways at some point during the date I tell her that it was cool how she asked me out and how awesome she is for having that kind of confidence.  Immediately  afterward she told me that this was not a date and actually had a boyfriend.  She asked me to the game because I looked like her boyfriend (she showed me his picture) and liked how confident I was in the classroom.  Dafuq, I have never heard of this happening before and am very certain this would never happen in the U.S. 

As of right now I am in literally what the fuck mode.  It's like I'm relearning the language of pickup and am a total AFC.  Are there any PUA's that have experience with women in Korea or Japan.

1376375861.0,152,self.seduction,1k9i86,[FR] From strangers to F-Close in 2 days,187,35,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1k9i86/fr_from_strangers_to_fclose_in_2_days/,"Hey seddit. I'm extremely new to the community. Just recently I decided to read up on some seduction techniques to refine my game. I had gotten by pretty well with what I guess some might call natural game, but I think it always helps to refine techniques. One thing I was noticing that was leading to issues in my game was that I would stray away from outcome independence if I wasn't actively approaching women on a regular basis. I would become needy around the girls that would sleep with me and end up fucking up by texting too often and referencing sex way too much. My attitude was making it seem as if I was someone who wasn't used to getting laid and I was driving women away. With these problems in mind, I looked to seddit for some things to keep in mind and believe I used them effectively this weekend.

Over the weekend I went to a house party with a girl that I had picked up in the mall and a close friend of mine. The party was pretty small, but there were a couple of cute girls there. I did not want to be rude and actively hit on other people in front of the girl that I went to the party with, but I'm always keeping opportunities in mind. I saw two cute girls standing by the stove in the kitchen and decided to open them with a story. I told them that I used to have a friend that would go to house parties and turn on the stoves and wait to see if people would try to sit or lean back into them. They gave some shocked laughter and commented on how fucked up this person in my imaginary story was. I agreed and we started chatting. The cuter of the two was giving me a lot of attention. She smiled, adjusted her hair a lot. She told me her name was Claire and I playfully told her that I had bad experiences with girls named Claire (would this be considered a neg? Not too sure). She laughed and assured me that she was one of the good Claires.

The party went on and I hung out with the girl I had come with for a little bit. I did not try to hide that I was there with this girl and had my arm around her for much of the party. She had to go escort her drunk friend home, so I kissed her goodbye and went back to the party. Claire and her friend were sitting down on a couch in the living room, so I sat down next to her and we started chatting again. To be honest, I don't really remember what she was talking about, but at some point at a natural pause in conversation, I took out my phone, put it on the keypad screen, and handed it to her, without offering an explanation. She looked at me and said ""Are you serious?"" I said yes and she asked ""Why do you want my number?"" At first I think I just brushed off the question and said something along the lines of ""I just want it"" until she said ""Give me a real reason."" I told her that I thought she was cute and that we should hang out some time. As a joke, she said ""Too cute for you."" so I immediately said ok and tried to snatch my phone back from her. She protested loudly and put her number in my phone. I said goodbye to the people in the party and left with my friend.

Keeping in mind the texting techniques that I had learned from seddit, I messaged the girl the next day, making a reference from the night before. I was a little more lenient with my text limit than what I've seen described on seddit (I'm 19, so I think girls my age are used to having all day text conversations with guys they talk to) but kept the conversation short and immediately moved on to making plans. I avoided asking her when she was free and instead said. ""Let's hangout tomorrow! Come over to my place tomorrow."" It was probably a little risky to suggest meeting at my place so early on, and she showed just a little bit of resistance by saying ""Yeah, or we could go out for lunch lol"" I replied ""No, we shouldn't go out to lunch"" and explained my opinion on dinner/movie first dates. I always say something along the lines of ""Dinner and movie dates don't let you talk and get to know the person you're on a date with."" I highly recommend this. I have not once had a girl say something other than ""I agree with you"" because otherwise she comes off as someone who's just looking for a free meal. This saves you money and lets you get personal with a girl early on. She agreed, so I told her to be at my house around 1.

Something came up earlier today, so I no longer had the open house to work with. I contacted the girl and told her I would have to change the time and meeting place. We arranged to meet up at a park halfway between our houses at 8:30. When I met her I hugged her right away, making sure to match my energy from the night of the party. I do my best to make sure that my personality doesn't seem to change from the first interaction I've had with a person. We sat down on a set of bleachers in the park and started chatting. She told me about her day at the lake and other general information about herself. At some point the topic of porn  came up and I asked playfully what kind of porn she preferred. She gave a little shocked laughter and said that we couldn't just start talking about a topic like that. I laughed it off, knowing that I had still opened the conversation for sexual topics. We talked for a bit longer and then I used another line that I read on seddit and said ""I'm going to kiss you now."" She smiled and leaned in.

We walked around the park for a little bit and sat down in a new spot. This time she brought up the conversation of sex as it related to her in past relationships. She mentioned that she believed it was better to wait for sex. I told her I disagreed and she mentioned that she would once made a guy wait four months for sex. I mentioned that I would not be in that guy's position and she asked me ""So if I held out on you, you would stop talking to me?"" I looked at her and smiled and assured her that I would in fact stop talking to her. She seemed a little taken aback but soon smiled and commented that she appreciated my bluntness. She asked me if I respected girls more if they waited for sex and I told her I don't judge girls based on their sexual dealings and I would have neither more nor less respect for her for holding out. At some point in the conversation she mentioned that she hadn't had sex since last November. I replied that we would have to fix that at some point. I was slowly becoming more bold. At a natural pause in conversation we began kissing. Things got heated and we were soon making out heavily. Fortune favors the bold so I began to work my way up her leg and under her shorts. She commented that her shorts were really tight and said ""I'm not sure I want to do this in a park."" I didn't stop what I was doing and just said ""nobody else is around."" I was surprised that she offered no further resistance and even pulled off her shorts when I asked her to. She was getting really into the action and so I decided to go for the home run. I said ""hold on a second."" She asked ""What now?"" I pulled out a condom and she asked ""Are we really going to do this right now?"" I just smiled and nodded and fucked her right there on the park bench.

And I have a feeling that there's a lot of BS here -- a lot of neckbearded, fat, low self esteem types who are marginally (or un-) employed, living with their parents. Woops, just described myself. But I think even the mod here described seddit as being full of ""armchair pickup artists"" at one point, and I bet that's true. How much of this is just guys going type type type type on the internet? And if you're here, you aren't out picking up girls, obviously.

But yeah...my sneaking suspicion is that the guys who are successful at this never really had a problem getting girls to begin with, and are just honing and perfecting their skills. But a lot of us (I think?) are SO far behind that we can't really even hope to get any girl. I can't talk to girls, or touch girls...I hate myself too much and I just think I'm disgusting and that girls don't want me. I don't even really like sex -- it doesn't feel good, because I had a really aggressive circumcision. It either hurts or is just numb. And, I hate competition and the thought of it -- I'm terrified of other men, and I just know I'm going to get shot down with some quip or even get beat up in a club if I tried to play pickup there.

So I dunno...I guess you might advise me to do ""inner game"" stuff until I'm happy with myself, and I suppose that's what I'll do and am doing. But this subreddit just fucking depresses me. I think I'm like the worst possible guy for pickup -- I imagine some PUA guru would like to take me under their wing and reform me, just to see if they could and as a testament to their skills.

I was raised by my mom as an only child, and have always had problems with social stuff. Girls would flirt with me in high school because of my good looks (which are now buried under a thick layer of fat), and I'd be too shy/scared/nervous/uncomfortable/something to reciprocate. It was almost like I felt pursued, like a woman...I had this strong ""ew run away a girl"" impulse. But I'm heterosexual -- I beat off furiously to images of women, and only fantasized about girls. Men just don't do it for me. This is purely a mental/social health problem, not a physiological sexuality problem.

Coming to /r/seduction is like this addiction that I can't stop. I come here and it's like looking in the window of an exclusive club you desperately want to be a member of, but are barred from at the door. I'm pretty sure my problems amount to hypergamy and sexual selection -- women, I think, are very very good at what you guys might call ""congruence tests"". Basically, you can't fool them into thinking your genes are of a higher quality than they are. I'm being selected out of the gene pool, because I don't have attractive qualities. I'm a sexual failure, basically. I wish I could be good with women, but I just can't. I don't feel good about myself. And this whole thing is just depressing. There's no solution :/

Gloom and doom, I know, and I admit that I'm just feeling sorry for myself to a degree. But I'm fucked up, and I think it might be better for me just to not want women anymore. Is there some way I can do that? Chemical castration? Join a monastery?

1351691249.0,150,self.seduction,12ebt7,[FR] Halloweekend,206,56,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12ebt7/fr_halloweekend/,"Greetings Sedditors,

For your reading convenience I will break this post up into 2 different sections and will include the lessons of each day at the end of the day so you may come back and read it at your leisure. I think there are some really important lessons for newbies in here so pay attention. 

****
Day 1: Throwing a party in my room. 

Recently I've been number closing tons of chicks and then friendzoning about half of them so I could throw a successful party. All my investments in these women finally came to fruition on this day. 

Me and my roommates got a bunch of halloween decorations, made some orange jungle juice, and got friends to pitch in for about $200 worth of cheap booze. There was a ludicrous amount of booze there and including some of the cheap party favors (tons of glow sticks, tube shots, plastic halloween cups etc etc) we were good to go. 

So the day before the party I compile a list of all the HB's i'd number closed in the last month and had established some rapport with (I think the number was like 67). I mass texted all of them that there was going to be a halloween party in my room and that they should make plans to come over. I got about a 45% response rate on the text, and what was great was that each of them were bringing friends. 

At this point I put my costume on, start drinking early and wait for the HB's to roll in. I have never seen a party with such a good ratio. I intentionally only invited my close guy friends (maybe 20), and there were probably about 50-60HB's there. It was so target rich that I literally opened like 20 sets. I had massive amounts of social proof because half the girls there I had established rapport with, and I was the host of the party. 

I settle in with one girl I'd never seen before easily an HB9, I asked how she ended up in my room. She told me she was friends with HB8 and she said ""Oh wait, are you bajing! HB8 talks about you all the time"". I knew I was in at that point with HB8, and I decided to play the friends off of each other. I kept talking about how cool HB8 was while I escalated Kino with HB9. HB9 started to get jealous because it seemed like I was more into HB8 and she literally lunged for my face when I asked her if she would like to kiss me. 

We hooked up for the remainder of the night, I left her at one point to go open another set and she followed me, trying to hold my hand and when I went and said hi to HB8 she came over, turned me around and made out with me hardcore. I'd obviously struck a nerve in their friendship and I fully intended to take advantage of it. She told me her feet hurt (she was a slutty nurse, in super high heels) so I told her we could go into my room so she could sit down. 

You can imagine the rest. 

Lessons:

1: When throwing a party ensure that you have lots of booze (NEVER DO BYOB)

2: Have party favors, things that make your party slightly unique but don't cost too much money

3: Being the host of a GOOD party gives you massive social proof. Girls texted me the entire next day saying how much fun they had and told me to text them for my next party

4: Jealousy is one of the most powerful emotions a human can feel, invoke it in your target and you are IN. 

5: Obviously this was Halloween so peoples inhibitions are lowered, but i'm still proud of this pickup. 

****

Day 2: Bro night, turns into my lucky night

I wake up with a hangover that rivals all that I've ever had before. The HB9 is sleeping next to me and I smiled remembering her, we were both too hungover to have a morning quickie but she makes out with me before she leaves and makes me promise to text her. I will later this week, I want to turn her into a MLTR because she really is smoking hot. 

After nursing my hangover for half the day I decide that I'm all partied out and want to just hang out with some bros. So we all get together around 9pm and go to a buddy of mines apartment. We're just having a good time listening to music when a buddy of mine brings in some girls. The ratio is terrible, probably around 30 dudes with 5 girls. 

One thing I've noticed in these environments is that women will cluster together and guys seeing this are very weary to approach. I having conquered the worst of my AA long ago, decide fuck it, whats the worst that can happen. I spy my target, an asian HB8 and open with the best opener of all time!!!!!!!!!! ""What are you supposed to be"" haha. 

She explains her costume, I tease her a little bit because it wasn't obvious. She responds RIGHT off the bat, keeps her hand on my chest as she talks, asks about where I live, my name, where I'm from etc etc. I tease her again asking if she's interviewing me, she tells me screens all her ""potentials"". I knew I was in but I wanted to keep her wanting more so I said ""Hey sweetie I gotta go talk to my friends now, but your cool so you should give me your number"". She gets this sad look on her face but puts her number in my phone and makes me promise to text her. I tell her I'm going to kiss her before I leave and her eyes go wide but she leans forward and I give her a quick kiss. Then leave as if nothing happens. 

After this I go bro out a little bit more, but annoyingly people keep high fiving me (don't ever do this to a fellow bro). I look over at her and keep eye contact for a while but then one of her friends doesn't feel well and she decides to take her home. I shurg it off, give her another kiss and tell her we'll hang out soon. 

I continue broing out, then get a text around 2am in the morning ""Watcha doing"". In case you don't know this is a HUGE IOI, I tell her I'm just having a drink in my room and that she should come up. She comes up, sexy time ensues!

Lessons:

1: Just because a party is a sausage fest does not mean you should not approach, in many cases guys will be intimidated. Don't be one of those guys. 

2: I was pretty out of state when I opened this set but I have a rule that if I see an HB that's cute I have to approach. Pretty much Mystery's Three Second Rule, don't think just react!

3: Use Push Pull. Get her number, Kiss her, but then leave. Kiss her again, but shrug off the fact that she's leaving. This constant back and forth will make her desire you even more. 

4: Don't stress about openers, just DO IT. One conversation is better than no conversations. My opener was just standard, it doesn't have to be canned or funny or w/e, get her talking from there who knows where you will go. 

I have more stories about the last 2 days of the hurricane weekend but this is long enough.

Hope all my fellow college sedditors had a great weekend! Let's see some more field reports on your successes. ",Field Report,False,,t5_2qhrv,False,frflair,,True,t3_12ebt7,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12ebt7/fr_halloweekend/,
1329675401.0,148,self.seduction,pwmsl,[FR] First kclose ever. Picture inside.,185,37,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pwmsl/fr_first_kclose_ever_picture_inside/,"**First of all, I would like to thank MetaSnow. He [motivated me to go out that night](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/purj6/why_is_pickup_so_fucking_frustrating_and/c3siqqe?context=3) and it's been the best decision ever. I love you man, you're fucking awesome.**

I called my best friend (who happens to be a super-AFC and is in a ""relationship"" with a LSE-LD) and told him that we were going out. He hesitated for a good 10 minutes until he finally agreed. 

I picked him up from his house and during the drive, I told him about my plan for tonight (He knows about pickup and claimed to be interested in it). He immediately agreed. 

Before we entered the club, I told him: ""Keep your head up, and act like you own this motherfucking club"". We entered and checked out the situation: 90% women. Holy mother of god. 

We sat down at the bar and checked out everyone. One AMOG, maybe a dozen AFCs and A LOT of women. I told my buddy that we were going to do a few warm-up approaches, and so we did. Nothing to spectacular (""Hey, do you think my friend here looks gay? Some dumb cow called him gay before. I mean, what the hell?""). I instructed him on the basic rules of kino and started to drive light kino on the girls we were talking to.

After 2 hours, we moved to the dance floor and proceeded to not give a crap. I could notice the attention of women around us - it's something I had never even experienced myself, and my friend was also blown away by it. Thinking about it now, it's not a big surprise, at all. We demonstrated our Alpha status all the time and acted like we were the shit. 

A set of 4 started to move closer to us on the dance floor, and I could see them giggling and pointing at my friend. I pulled my friend aside and told him: ""Those girls are showing interest, especially the thin blonde. Approach them. I'll help you."" Unfortunately, he didn't have the balls to approach them (neither did I), so we just continued dancing. The thin blonde moved closer and closer, until she ""accidentally"" grinded on my friend's cock. I whispered ""Game's on."" in his ear. 5 minutes later he's dancing with her, 10 minutes later they make out. My buddy probably thinks I'm a fucking guru now. Truth is, I don't know shit and fear still affects (affected) my game.

Now, I'm alone on the dance floor, my friend went to a more silent area of the club. Fine with me, I continued to dance and not give a shit. Well, I gave a little bit of shit, because my goal that night was a kclose and I was sure as hell going to get one. 

So I turn my head to the left and spot a cute girl next to me in a dress. I think ""why not"" and approach her.

**Mo3:** Well, at least you're not dressed as boring as I am. [[There's a tradition in Germany called Fasching, everyone dresses up in costumes. I went in a black shirt.]]

**HB:** *giggles* Yeah, I made this dress myself. It's pretty nice, isn't it?

**Mo3:** Sure, but this.. thing [[there was a peace of cloth hanging down, no idea how you call that]] is a little bit too long, isn't it? (I start kino by touching her back, while crapping my pants because I am/was really really scared of touching girls)

**HB:** Noooo, I just hold it up a little bit. blah blah 

*At this point, I didn't give a single crap and it was a fantastic feeling. So I just took her shoulder, pulled her towards me and started dancing with her. Something I'd never even dreamed about doing, and I nearly blacked out thinking about what could've happened. But nothing happened. She just smiled at me and grabbed my back. I was amazed.*

*5 minutes of dancing, nothing really happened except that. I took charge of the situation, pulled her closer and sometimes pushed her away a little bit. Then the DJ said ""Do it, guys.. prove that you can rock this night"" (thank you by the way, DJ). I thought ""god be with me""  and went in for the kiss. She didn't pull back, though she was a little bit surprised at first. Didn't matter to me, I pulled her closer and kissed her again. 

**Insert another 15 minutes of grinding, me grabbing her ass and kissing her. She later told me that her brother was watching us all the time. I felt fucking badass. Then she told me that she was 23 (I'm 18) and that she's about to be a Religion teacher. I felt like a fucking god.**

After that I excused myself, told her to give me her number and invited her to iceskate on Saturday. Then I went to my friend, sat next to him and we both just stared at each other in disbelief.

Well, that's the end of the story, kids. I have never experienced anything like this, and it was my first kiss too. I still had huge AA and fear of touching and rejection, but I ignored my feelings for a few minutes and got rewarded. This game has just started..

To fix this I'd recommend heading over to [malefashionadvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice) then READING the sidebar, then using the [shopping links](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/eozr8/where_to_buy_online_guide/) to purchase some new clothing.

A list of quick and dirty tips you can do right [now](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/newbie-fashion-tips-for-grown-up-men.html)

But first, you need to learn the [basics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/a8zrf/the_basics_lets_compile_a_good_list/)

I'd recommend going on there and other fashion forums, lurking, and checking out what people are doing. Learn from them.

One thing though, MFA usually recommends clothes in an almost circle jerk like uniform fashion, partly because some of them are uninformed or lazy.

This is because they're trying to teach you the basics, the ""staple"" of dressing well. It may not be right for you. For example, if you are really really skinny, someone might recommend you 501 levis, but I personally wouldn't go for levis 501 STF(because they don't compliment very skinny people well), I'd go for 511s or 510s. 

Just because they recommend something like desert boots, doesn't mean that desert boots go with everything. They're good people, but you have to be specific. Don't follow ALL of their advice on everything because not everyone actually knows what they're talking about, though this is the minority. Just because it works for them it doesn't mean it works for you. If you're from MFA, don't get butthurt.

**The users on the sidebar all know what they're doing, when they post, listen to them.**

Being fashionable isn't really as expensive as you think, you can be stylish on a budget. It's MUCH simpler than you think.

Dressing well is **CRUCIAL**, believe me it makes you a huge difference and communicates a lot about you to others. It says, ""I am socially intelligent and know how to dress, I am social and cool."" Even attractive chicks pay attention to a guy who is dressed really fashionably. **It's an INSTANT DHV** that you don't even need to communicate.

You do not need to dress flashy or with logos to be fashionable, muted colors, no logos, and being well fitted pretty much displays that you're so alpha and prestigious that you don't even need any ""brand"" or any shit to show off. It's a counter signal(think of like how someone who has a lot of girls to hang out with doesn't care about one girl, so you signal that you don't care because you have so many more options). Dressing better in no logos makes you stand out MORE.

Here's a quick example,

What do you think when you see this guy?

This man, is INSTANTLY treated better, he looks powerful, badass, and he seems prestigious, he looks rugged and alpha. I feel like I'm ruining the badassness for you guys but I need to tell you because I know someone is going to come in and say I don't know what I'm talking about, but he's actually a designer, and gay, and has a feminine voice. I wouldn't google his other outfits, he breaks a lot of rules that most of you cannot pull off yet.

Nothing is douchier(and I'm going to offend lots of people here) than going out with your [button up stripey going to get laid shirt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxCr2XW1_44). You know what I'm talking about. It makes you look like any other guy. I've also noticed that many guys here wear graphic tees and striped button downs with DRAGONS on them. Don't do this. Edit: The video was a Louis C.K. - Dudes Trying to Get Laid. It's hilarious.

If you are over 18 do not purchase any graphic t-shirts with huge logos. Seriously, do NOT do this.

Before you purchasing things ask yourself, ""What will I wear this X item with?"" Create a whole outfit before you purchase your clothing and ask MFA about it.

Oh, and remember to dress for the seasons. Right now you should be buying a [Spring/Summer wear.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/g6bmc/mfa_request_summer_guide/)

Just remember, dressing well makes a HUGE difference. Part of looking good is also being fit, this is very important when you consider dressing well. If you plan to lose weight I recommend on doing this FIRST then purchasing a brand new wardrobe.

I've spent quite a long time writing this for you guys, I've been thinking about it for a while, I hope it helps you guys. Also if you improve your wardrobe post about it!

*This thread is not about suits. It is a basic wardrobe guide.*

tl;dr

###Do you want to know how to start looking better? 

Simplify.

Stop wearing clothes with logos, prints and crazy details.

Instead, focus on great basics. When I say basics, I mean basics. White t-shirt. Blue dress shirt. White oxford. Blue jeans. Gray wool pants. Khaki chinos. Blue blazer. Gray suit. Great boots. Basic shoes. Focus on blue, white, gray. Buy good clothes that fit.

Minimalize.

1371918880.0,148,self.seduction,1gv0wv,I just had the worst night I've had in a LONG time,220,72,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1gv0wv/i_just_had_the_worst_night_ive_had_in_a_long_time/,"27[M]. About 2 months ago, I got out of a 3 year long relationship. The relationship wasn't going anywhere, and there were other reasons it came to an end.

So, I've been trying to get out there, to atleast get a rebound or something. It hasn't been good. I don't have nearly the success with women that I used to have, which I largely chop up to being overweight and out of practice.

Had a girl a few weeks back that showed definite interest, but then froze me out. That sucked, but I got over it.

So last night, I go to a going away party for a coworker who was leaving for another job. This coworker is my age and attractive and intelligent and I kinda had a thing for her. Started off with a large crowd of people, but eventually dwindled down to me, her, and her best friend. We were both drunk. We danced a bunch and made out a little. She even gave me a lap dance and rubbed my junk through my pants.

Before long, it's time for us all to go. Her best friend, apparently seeing how things were going well for me, left her in my care for the night. She was drunk as well as I, and that's when she really got crazy. She started crying about how everyone had left her and I was the only one who stuck around.

She tried to get in her car and drive away, and I have to wrestle the keys from her, meanwhile she **bites me** a bunch and tries to use her feminine wilds to convince me to give her her keys, which I refuse to do. I eventually get pretty pissed off, but I succeed in getting her into a cab. She refuses to tell me where she lives, and rather demands that we go to another coworker's house. I don't know where she lives, so I figure going to the friends house is the best option (I should have just brought her to my place, but it was trashed).

So we go to the other coworker's house, and from the get go, she's all over him. Long story short, I end up trying to sleep on the couch, but I'm kept up all night by the sound of them fucking, with a deep feeling of shame for allowing myself to be treated in such a way.

Now I'm sitting her, dwelling on how horrible the night was, how no women are into me, and trying to think about how I should fix it. My main idea is to put my social life on the backburner, and focus strickly on fitness and weight loss for atleast the next 6 months. I'm muscular, but I'm 280lbs, so it doesn't really help me much.

What does Seddit think?

Can't stress enough how important it is to be YOU",176,26,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vjnsn/as_my_confidence_has_grown_some_things_ive/,"My half assed attempt to say my experience so far actively developing confidence and better game in turn.

I am neurotic to a good degree, self deprecating, miss quite a few social norms/manners...and before these things used to work against me.

I would have some success with girls, some decent ones at that, but it was mostly because I was kinda awkward and funny and only accidentally came off as confident. 

I've always liked myself, especially for the bad things (listed above) that would end up working against me because I didn't know how to use them FOR me. 

A few things happened to help me develop more confidence. I was able to recognize what was good about me and not good about me. This means physically and personality. I was blessed with some good features, but have some that have generally embarrassed me before. This recognition I think can be tough. You have to be real with yourself. You have to adjust...but you don't need to change yourself. For me, that meant stumbling into a style that fits me, working on social cues, realizing that I am truly funny, and realizing it's HEALTHY to pursue girls. I don't use too much of this seduction stuff besides basic principles, but whenever I heard PUA, I figured, ""scumbag"".

It's not necessarily about just getting to sleep with the girl either. Those can be fun but building your own self worth is so critical to the next step in a possible relationship and in life. I couldn't believe I was dating this one girl recently who was pretty much a babe. And I remember thinking, ""I doubt I could ever seriously date this girl in high school""...but what was nice was that we actually got along really well. 

One thing too..maybe the most important thing. Even if you are typically like how I described myself in the first line of the post (self deprecating, etc), you can still have confidence. Every girl wants a guy with confidence. I know a guy who has some really weird tendencies that a lot of girls don't necessarily like but some do (that's key, you can't get everyone, that's ok! You'll get more if accept that you win some and lose some). This girl is in love with him because when she asks him, ""why do you do what you do""...he just responds, ""Because I like it"". He is sure in himself, and that's where the confidence actually kicks in. 

Macho doesn't equal confidence. Trusting yourself, truly knowing yourself, being willing to learn, and loving yourself are some of the keys. 

What about what specifics work with girls? What do they like? Etc. It doesn't matter too much. That comes with instincts and experience and common sense. Some were given more than others so work with it, but I think the keys are...

1) Find what you are good with and not so good with.

2) Adjust accordingly

3) If you aren't typically confident, you don't have to change who you are to develop confidence

4) Love and value yourself 

Remember, you'll always do a better job of being yourself in the long run than being someone else.

I decided ""fuck it, may as well try"" while the whole time thinking about the ""blow me or blow me out"" technique. I said, ""Hey, I've seen you around and I just wanted to introduce myself, my name is Blah blah. What's yours?"" She tells me her name and says, "" I haven't had one of those in forever!"" (referring to the Popsicle) and I said here, have some. I held the Popsicle to her mouth and she took a bite and said ""mmmmm"". I then proceeded to say, you know you just ate something that was inside my mouth, that's like if I were to kiss you right now."" She said, ""Yeah, it is."" Feeling good, I decided to caveman and I just went for the kiss and she was feeling it too. It turned into like a 30 second make out.
It was so fucking alpha, she said ""I've never been kissed like that"" and I said, ""well we'll have to do something about that"". We then said our goodbyes and I got her #. 

Is this alpha? I'm not sure where I got the confidence, but I'm sure my looks played a part of it too. Also, remember to dress well.

I wanted to hear from the mouths of several beautiful women what their opinions were on what is attractive, so I came up with 9 questions that are the most common for guys to ask.

1.	What are the 3 most attractive qualities you look for in a guy?

2.	What can a guy do that makes a GOOD first impression

3.	How do you define a “confident male?”

4.	What is the most unattractive quality in a guy?

5.	Do you prefer a dominate man or a submissive man when it comes to sex

6.	Is it important that the guy you are with is confidence when it comes to sex? Why

7.	How important is confidence in the guy you are with/like (Scale of 1-10 and why)

8.	How important is their looks (Scale of 1-10)

9.	If you were to offer dating advice to a guy what ONE tip would you give them


The age range of girls that I polled was 19-29 and I sent these questions out to them and asked them to be 100% open and honest. 

**According to women THE MOST attractive qualities are.**

The women that took part in this survey were VERY consistent in their answers. None of the women knew each other but every woman who took this survey listed 1 of the 3 qualities they find attractive as confidence. Guy’s have heard for a long time now that confidence is a very important quality to possess but a lot of them cannot answer why confidence is so attractive. Furthermore they cannot tell you how to bring about confidence. Some guys give the “fake it till you make it” advice when it comes to confidence but women are perceptive and they can spot a fake confidence a mile away. 

Other traits that women listed to be amongst the most attractive are: a good sense of humor (ranked very high), honesty and a good personality.  These were the traits that women found to be THE MOST attractive qualities a man can possess. 

**Women think that a good first impression should include.**

It’s often said you never get a second chance to make a first impression. I wanted to ask women what makes a good first impression and the results might surprise you.  One woman said, 

*“Don’t be too obvious and invasive, I like to know that a guy is attracted to me via subtle hints or a tasteful compliment, but focused more on getting to know me if there is a spark between us. I like to know that any initial attention I receive from a guy during and after meeting him is based off of my personality and our conversations.”*

This is interesting because most guys go into a conversation with a woman from a place of insecurity and fear of rejection. This woman suggestion that subtly and tasteful compliments make a good impression. She also mentions finding out if there is a spark between them. From my perceptive, I believe that this girl is saying be playful (subtle and tasteful compliments), but also see if there is a connection. Guys, generating attraction isn’t something you do…. Attraction is something you are. I believe ultimately this girl is saying the “spark” she is after is an emotional response to something. Let’s face it not all guys give women positive emotional responses. 
Let’s see what other women had to say about first impressions.  Most women polled said they want a guy to make them laugh and be fun. One women said, 

*“make me laugh, indirectly pay attention to me.”*


I have said for a long time that fun is the ultimate attractor for women. Women want to laugh and have fun and when you can do that it leaves a positive first impression. This doesn’t mean you need to be a standup comedian but it does show confidence to display your personality. 

**How Women Define a “Confident Male”.**

Guys struggle to define a confidence male, so for this question I wanted the girls to try and define it. Since they ranked confidence as such an attractive feature let’s see what they had to say about it. 

*“Confidence is most obvious to me through body language. Especially when a guy is around other guys/in a group is when I can tell if they are confident with themselves or have something to prove”*

This woman said that confidence is most obvious through body language. Here she is saying there is a visual component to confidence. She also goes on to say that when a guy is around other guys she can tell if they are confidence or if they have something to prove. This insinuates there is another component to confidence as well. Women are very perceptive and if you are displaying arrogance rather than confidence it obviously hurts you. Another woman said, 

*“Someone that knows what he wants and knows his self worth”*


I often define confidence as the value that you place on yourself. Value broken down is the relative worth or importance you place on something. This woman is 100% correct in her definition of a confident male. These traits that women define as “confident” are right on and guys need to learn how to display them from an authentic place or they will miss out on the most attractive trait a guy can have. 

**Women Think That The Most Unattractive Trait is.**

Without a doubt every woman said the most unattractive trait is… Arrogance. Arrogance is often confused for confidence when it comes to guys and so it is vital that guys understand the difference between the two traits. Arrogance will push women away and confidence will create attraction. Women also mentioned that being over sexual in your comments is unattractive as well. I agree, I think being playful and sexual in your comments while the woman is attracted to you is positive and not what this girl was talking about. Far too often guys will come on strong and turn things sexual before the woman is even attracted to the guy and this will come across as “creepy” and believe me guys, the LAST thing in the world you want to hear is the word “creepy.” 

**Do Women Prefer A Dominant or Submissive Man In Bed.**

Think you know the answer?
Out of all the women polled, every woman said both. A lot of times guys get the “idea” that all women want to be dominated. They mistake the word domination for control and they are two very different things.  Sex takes on different phases in a relationship and it evolves over time, this is why I believe women said both. 

**Do women Think Confidence is Important When it Comes to Sex?**

Answer? A resounding YES. Every woman added that it is important that the guy is open to new things and new experiences. Confidence should not be mistaken for perfection. Guys don’t need to be perfect at something but they should be confidence and open to new things.  One woman added, 

*“If they don't really know what they're doing, they should be confident enough to laugh it off or be honest”*

Confidence is not about being god’s gift to women; let’s face it I already have that covered.  In all seriousness, confidence is about being able to say I am not perfect but I am going to do my best to make this an experience we both enjoy. It takes a real man to admit their flaws and then improve on them. 

**How Important is Confidence to Women?**

I asked the women polled to rate how important confidence is in the guy they are with from a scale of 1-10. Collecting the data the average of all the women together was 9 out of 10. Women had a lot to say when it came to this question. One woman said,

*“confidence is sexy, I don't want to keep having to reassure someone that I like them or that their shirt looks fine.”*

Knowing that confidence is that important to women as a trait they need in a guy, it’s something that guys should spend a lot more time on. 

**How Important is Physical Appearance to Women?**

Again, I asked on a scale of 1-10 and averaging up their totals equaled a 6.5. Notice that confidence ranked a 9 and physical appearance a 6.5. One woman said, 

*“I realized that people I thought were like a 10 on the sexy scale are actually the dumbest men on earth.”*

Physical appearance ranked slightly above average and the answers really varied from woman to woman. The important thing to note is that confidence is significantly more attractive than physical appearance when it comes to how women define attraction. This is not to negate physical appearance altogether but it shows that while physical appearance may get you in the door, personality traits keep you there. 

**Dating Tips From Women.**

Finally, I asked women what is one tip they would give a guy when it comes to girls. Here is what they had to say:

*“Please don’t act like you are God’s gift to the world. Girls like confidence but they also want someone approachable and fun. Cocky is NOT attractive. If you talk too much about yourself you’re overcompensating for something and you’re not really that confident in yourself.”*


*“Challenge her. If you act like her doormat, you only have yourself to blame when the relationship becomes resentful.”*

This is why having self confidence is so important. The guy who respects and values himself will stand up for himself. 

**Final Thoughts…**

As we can see, confidence is very attractive to women, arrogance is the most unattractive trait and physical appearance while important isn’t the thing that sustains or grows attraction. At the end of the day from all the results I got it I sat back with a clear picture of the traits women want. Women want authenticity in the men they are with. Men think they need to be tuff or cool or fit into a stereotype to be accepted by women but the irony is self confidence is a belief in the authentic you and that is the most attractive quality for women. Pick up lines, routines and perfect bodies are not the answers to attracting women.

If you want to attract women, be attractive to yourself.

It's great because if a group of chicks or even a mixed group is sitting at the next table over, its easy to be friendly and get them to join you.

Heres the game:
-You put a full or mostly full pack of cigarettes on the edge of the table (skinny long side) and using one finger, flip it hard enough so that it rotates at least once.
-If it lands on its long side (the side it started) 3 second chug for the person of your choice, if it lands on its short side it's a 10 second chug for the person of your choice, if it lands on its flat side you chug for 4 seconds
-The deck rotates around the table after each turn

Fast paced, everyone's watching, everyone's involved, a whole lot of teasing the girls and trash talking your friends. Only downside is that it lasts about 10-15 minutes before it starts getting old

1343148839.0,151,self.seduction,x2wqw,"Learning from ""The Bachelorette""",186,35,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x2wqw/learning_from_the_bachelorette/,"We all know the concept. 25 guys are lined up to win the heart of a one woman, and over the weeks she narrows down the field to find the one she wants to spend the rest of her life with. Despite the fact that it's a ""reality"" TV show in a completely fabricated scenario, it's still an incredibly interesting social scenario to study. I'd like to share some of my observations.

*halfhearted spoiler alert for those of you living under rocks*

This season recently ended and we learned that the winner was Jef, an entrepreneur from Utah. With that hindsight, watching his game in the first two episodes is very interesting.

In episode one, he makes a flashy entrance, riding in tow behind the limo on a skateboard rather than riding inside with the other guys. This separates him in a very positive way. He demonstrated (showed, not told), Emily something about him - that he's a fun, chill guy who probably has hobbies and adventures outside of his ""entrepreneur"" label. He's not a bad skateboarder either, so it wasn't just some prop. There were someother flashy entrances too, from the guy who danced in with a boombox blaring club music to the rich kid who drops in from a helicopter. Jef's was just unique enough without seeming ridiculous, over-the-top, or try-hard.

Next, as he walks in, he picks up his skateboard and chucks it in the bushes. That takes the focus off of his prop, and brings it back to him as he introduces himself for the first time. Emily comments that he shouldn't have done that, that she wants to try it out later. Just like that, he's gotten himself an ""in"" for spending time with her later, whereas everyone else has to awkwardly interrupt a conversation and pull her away to get their 5 minutes of alone time with her.

Later that first night, we see Emily walking outside to meet Jef, who's been sitting in the gazebo he arranged, complete with some champagne. He stands up and walks to her as she comes in, but very importantly, he has not come hunting for her. His first impression was good enough that she would come to him, and all he had to do was be ready when the opportunity came. He was confident, collected, and patient, whereas many of the other guys were literally sweating about getting time with Emily as the night wound down. His reward for his patience? This line from Emily:

*I really like Jef. He made a great first impression. He's super cool, and I hope he thinks I'm cool, too.*

In episode 2, this dynamic continues. After the group date ends, the group is back with Emily in the mansion that evening. When she finally finds Jef, she confides to the cameras:

*Either Jef's playing hard to get or he's just not into me.*

Face-to-face with Jef, she elaborates:

*When I came in here tonight I said 'Where the hell is Jef? Like where has he been all day? Why hasn't he come talk to me? ... When I hang out with you I feel very awkward, like I feel like I'm in middle school like I'm the annoying younger sister like 'hey, look at me, look at me!'*

At that point, he realizes that he's pushed her far enough, and that the time is right to pull her back in. As Emily tells him about how she's been wanting a sign of interest from him, like a returned glance for example, he tells that he honestly has not noticed her checking him out, and that he feels the same insecurity and awkwardness around her. He validates her feeling of vulnerability and builds rapport by matching her sentiment. Yet the underlying message is still clear - this will be an even exchange between them. It won't be him hot in pursuit and her drinking it up. If she wants the reward of his attention, she needs to be prepared to work and give him something as well.

After writing this, I looked for some post-finale thoughts from Jef and found this:

*Many have questioned whether Jef’s reticence around Emily was the result of shyness, or if he was playing hard to get as a strategy. He suggested that it was a little of both. “I wanted her to know that there was a guy who wasn’t trying to chase her like crazy,” he said. But he also implied that he thought his approach intrigued the Bachelorette.  “I think it was kind of cool to make her wait … I was the one guy who was like, 'You’re going to have to fight for me too. I don’t want to be the only guy who is pursuing you here. I want you to pursue me.’"" Needless to say, this is not a strategy that comes up much on The Bachelorette, or in life for that matter.*

To be honest, I haven't watched any further episodes, but I think that this is plenty to digest for now. First impressions matter, and this is how a winner made his and outshone 24 other very eligible bachelors. As always, the moral of the story is the same principles that have brought you success here before. 

1) Don't be needy.

2) You are the prize.

3) Everything in moderation. Know when to tone it back and be vulnerable.

(forgot to mention in the summary that we were also casually drinking the whole time, not to the point we got wasted but had just enough to feel a nice buzz). I left out a lot of details to make things quick.

While at my place, we had a casual conversation at which point I asked him to close his eyes and wait till I come back. I sneaked into the kitchen and grabbed a small cheese cake, lit up the candle and went back into the room. I told him to open his eyes at which point I sat on his lap holding the cheesecake so he could blow out the candle. He was genuinely happy and surprised (a couple of days ago was his birthday). 

I had just grabbed two small spoons for us instead of being more formal and grabbing plates.There was music already playing on my laptop, so we just started talking and joking around while digging into the delicious strawberry cheesecake. I spoon fed his first bite and tried to make lots of light flirtatious body contact. Lightly grabbing his back and thighs while we sat and laughed. There were many IOIs coming from both directions, but I was still not sure if it was just a part of his personality and natural charm or if he was showing direct interest in me. 

A good song came on so I took advantage of the moment and told him it was one of my favorite songs and it put me in a the perfect mood, and gave him a look that said it all but with a refined girly, innocent sort of grace to it. 

I was putting my intentions forward without being too blunt and forceful. I was blushing hard, so out of shyness I kept on looking away, but didn't give up! I looked back up at him in to his eyes then his lips. Then, I licked my lips very subtly and smiled at him. It went perfectly, he leaned over and kissed me and before I knew it, I was on his lap making out, and taking his shirt off. The rest is history. 

Thanks for giving me the confidence and needed advice. While flirting looking at a persons eyes then lips actually works as a great indicator you want a kiss. I was so happy this worked without me actually having to go all out and say I want a kiss from him. It gets the point across while still being innocent enough to move past in case of rejection.

1328533409.0,149,self.seduction,pd491,"First Time Out, Crash and Burn!",188,39,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pd491/first_time_out_crash_and_burn/,"I am 44 and recently out of a 24 year marriage. I started dating my wife in High School and we have been together even since so I have zero experience dating. I am a good looking guy, most people guess I am about 30, and I am in good shape.

I have never dated, never had one night stands, and I have never picked up on women, let alone be a PUA.

I went to a local club (women my age) and I froze. I couldn't even ask the women to dance. The place was packed, a good live band, and lots of dance-able Eighties and Nineties music. The place is upscale and this does weed out the clientele. 

The place was packed with brothers and my first learning was this: Black men have no problem approaching a woman, they are fearless. If I hesitated a minute someone was cutting me off and approaching the woman before I got out of my seat.  I am gonna learn a lot from watching these guys but I was super intimidated. 

One woman approached me and we danced a couple of songs. She kept grinding on me (seemed like the only dance move she knew) but then as we were talking later (I sat at her table when she was alone and started a conversation) she kept saying how she was just out for fun and dancing, nothing more. Not sure what that was about. She kept bringing up work conversation so I was thinking she was new to this scene as well. I should have steered the conversation right there with something. ""Does talking about work excite you? Tell me something you think is exciting"", would have worked well I think). If this woman had not approached me to dance I don't think I would have approached her table afterward. 

I tried to approach a few women even some unattractive ones and I balked. I felt totally fake and insincere and I think this held me back. I know I only want to get laid or practice a technique. I don't care about the woman I am approaching and I have no intention to. The ""Good Guy"" inside me gets in the way. I feel like I am in Jr. High again when it comes to women. 

BUT, this sub did give me the inspiration to go out to a club. I had the intent to meet women, and I even danced with one. The first woman I have danced with in a club in my life that was not my wife. 

One woman who stopped on her way out told me, ""Hun, I been watching you pace this club all night long,  just ask any girl to dance and she is gonna say yes. It is what they came here for.""

RING! They did come here to dance! They did come here to have a guy pick them up! They EXPECT me to be hitting on them, just like all the other guys are doing, they are just comfortable with doing it. 

I have analyzed (not over analyzed I think) the night and I can see all my mistakes and even learned a few things. 

Learnings:

Black dudes act fast with the ladies and win so follow suit.

In a club, the ladies expect you to be hitting on them.

I have to be in control of the conversation I am having and be aware of my own behavior and set the tone.

It looks so much easier on paper. 

TL/DR - 44 year old guy, first time in my life out trying to meet women and I learned a lot in one night. You gotta be in control and fuck fear and the ladies want you to talk to them.",,False,,t5_2qhrv,True,,,True,t3_pd491,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pd491/first_time_out_crash_and_burn/,
