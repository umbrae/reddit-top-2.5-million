All I ever wanted in life was a purpose and a career. The schizophrenia makes my thinking disorganized, and the medication to control it destroys my short term memory.

My dad got me a sales job at his company. Not telemarketing, full blown business to business sales.

During training nobody took me seriously because I spoke one or two syllables at a time and sales requires the gift of gab. I wasn't even sure if I was going to make it.

So what I did to overcome it, is treated every technique I was instructed like it come from the mouth of god. 

Not only did I shock everyone by using a hell of a lot more than two syllables at a time when talking to customers, I got 3 new contacts in my frist day.

My trainer quickly changed his tune from going through the motions until I left, to the attitude of ""this guys really good, I need to fine tune him so he can be great"".

The accountant started talking to me about how I wanted my checks deposited. He didn't do that during training, word got around quick that I'm going to be there for a very long time.

1340202105.0,53,self.DecidingToBeBetter,vburl,Quit drinking. Quit smoking. Losing weight. Met a girl.,59,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/vburl/quit_drinking_quit_smoking_losing_weight_met_a/,"Just ran across this sub and thought I'd offer what has been a crazy month....

In a nutshell, this was me a little over a month ago:

- pining over an ex that was dating someone else
- drinking 1-3 shots of whiskey a night and/or 2-10 beers a night
- smoking a pack a day
- being 45-65 lbs overweight

Then I'd had enough.  One of the breaking points was finding out that my ex's new guy was a good friend of mine. There was a lot more involved, including work problems, self-image problems, etc.  But that's what flipped the switch.

So, on May 21, I started p90x Insanity.  I haven't worked out in 15 years.  People said I'd fail in the first week.  I didn't.  About a week later, I changed my eating habits with some advice from /r/fitness.  One month later, I was only down 9 lbs.  But I definitely felt stronger, had more endurance, and could see more definition in my arms and legs.

June 12, Tuesday. I found out about the ex and friend.  I got hammered drunk.  Wednesday morning I decided that I was done with using alcohol to drown my problems.  I decided to do something positive.  People said I'd fail. I haven't had a drink since.  As a guy that hasn't gone over three days without a drink in roughly 20 years, this was huge for me.

June 14, Thursday. I ran out of cigarettes.  I bought nicotine patches instead of another pack.  Fuck cigarettes.  My father said, ""even if you only quit for two days, that's pretty good.""  Fuck pretty good. I haven't had one since.

June 15, Friday. I went on a blind date with an amazing woman. I had diarrhea (that subsided for the night, thank goodness); she puked twice due to stomach issues.  Things went better than expected. We've been together or talked every day since.

June 20, today.  Insanity MAX workouts started two days ago. In those two days, I've lost another 2.6 lbs.  That fat is gradually disappearing and muscles are growing.

So, that's it.  Every day, I get up excited about what today will bring.  I have more energy.  I am more patient and thoughtful, yet I speak my mind more confidently.  I am Alpha.  Lastly, I suppose I must reference two major influences on my dramatic changes.....

And for now, as i started looking around me, i see that almost all my ""friends"" are depressed, close-minded people with a low self esteem and NO WILL TO CHANGE their life or situation. 

For example, i just started looking for a summer job, and i asked two of my ""friends"" to come with me just to keep me company. As we passed by restaurants and shops, they just kept telling me ""these guys will NEVER accept your resume, be realistic man, go work in a factory or something, you will never make it"" ... WHAT THE HELL !? i needed their moral support not pulling my (already) low self esteem. Add to that, that whenever i try to go somewhere, a party, a concert, a walk in the park or whatever, they just tell me : ""naaah, forget it man, let's just stay inside and play video-games"" ... 

Now don't get me wrong, they are VERY nice people, they just are not good enough for me. I tried changing their way of behaving, always bringing new plans, and being positive. they just don't want to try ... and i feel that instead of me trying to pull them up, they are starting to pull me down. 

I feel i have now reached the bottom,i start to feel lost, i WANT TO CHANGE, i really do, but i feel trapped by my surrounding. I no longer want to hang out with them, but i have NO OTHER POSITIVE FRIENDS. And i don&lt;t want to break the heart of they guys i already hang out with.

",37,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1ay5yc/how_do_you_let_go_of_anger_towards_other_people/,"I've been told I have a real knack for holding a grudge, and I know they are right. I am a very understanding and forgiving person up to a point, but once you cross that line, I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. I am getting to be a very angry, cynical, distrusting, bitter person because I just can't seem to let things go, and as life continues on, I continue to deal with more unbelievable crap from people. I have amazing self-control when it comes to outwardly expressing my anger- I'm not argumentative, I don't punch things, etc., but I'm boiling mad inside, and I feel exhausted. It definitely interferes with every aspect of my life in one way or another.

I used to believe that there was some cosmic balance that would penalize or reward us for doing good or bad - I would tell myself that they would get ""theirs"" eventually, that what goes around, comes around, but from what I've experienced so far in my 35 years on this planet, I have no reason to believe that is actually the case. In all reality, that only made me feel better because I was wanting revenge, but what I know I really need to work on is forgiveness. 

This growing anger inside me has been there for as long as I can remember, so I feel like I'm really hard-wired to be like this, but I really need to change my ways of digesting the things that happen to me, I just have no idea where to start. 

Does anyone who is reading this have any advise for dealing with this sort of problem? I'm in therapy, and I've been in and out of it for 20 years now, and I can't seem to have a ""breakthrough"" on this issue. Any genuine advice would be greatly appreciated :) Thanks!

Edit: If there is a better subreddit for this, feel free to let me know. I wasn't really sure where to post...

about 15 years ago i had a complete and total mental/emotional breakdown due to a dormant childhood trauma that i had repressed triggered by an event involving my very young daughter who at the time was 5 years old..and finally a nightmare that revealed a childhood of absolute horror.

as a result i have ptsd/depression/agoraphobia and severe anxiety. mostly about strange people or places/crowds and having no 'escape route'. so for 15 years ive stayed inside mostly with the company of my cats/rats and computers. i am currently on disability and have been for some years. i hate it.

about a year and a half ago i fired my shrink and dumped my meds. took months to just be un zombied from all the meds they had me on..

today i feel ready to try to go back to the world and become employed again..obviously there will be obstacles with my endeavor but i feel better equipped to meet them.

i was going to enroll in a program for the disabled which would have retrained me and helped me find employment within my limitations. that fell through simply because they really wanted to crawl into my personal life and have me go back to a shrink..

so i decided to do what i did long ago and volunteer in a field i liked to gain knowledge/experience and see what further education i might need a long the way.

i want to work in ecology/environment..maybe forestry etc.. but i dont really know what kinds of jobs are available or the experience i would need.

i have been accepted as a summer steward for the nature conservancy to care for one of the nature preserves they care for..
im very excited but it isnt enough and i really could use some suggestions on other areas i might volunteer in or suggestion on how to get started. i know that isnt super clear but that is why i'm posting this. i'm hoping some of you guys might have some ideas or suggestions..

thanks for your time everyone :)

**EDIT: WOW, some great ideas. so grateful for the encouragement and suggestions. i have started a list with them all and will go through them one by one.**

**you folks are so helpful and really this morning my heart is smiling**

I recently made a new username and hope to just use this one from now on, with only motivational and fitness related subs.

I find myself making promises that I don’t keep over and over.  I promise I will eat better.  I promise I will work out more.  I promise I will stop procrastinating and get off the computer and away from the TV.  I tell myself I *will* do these things.  When it comes time to do them, I inevitably shrug them off, saying I'll do them later.  When I do this I feel disappointed in myself, deflated, and beaten.  I do it anyway.

I make promises to myself and say that Future Me will do them.  Future Me will make a difference this time.  Future Me is a great guy.  The problem is, all of that is true.  I just have never truly been Future Me.  

Present Me is a liar.  Present Me is lazy.  Present Me says that Future Me will take care of everything.

I realize this time and time again.  It’s gotten to the point that it saddens me when I make these plans to better myself; to recommit to doing something knowing I won't do them or won't be committed enough to last more than 2 weeks.

It’s time to stop letting myself down.

I won’t promise myself I will eat less, exercise more, and make better use of my time.  Not again.  It’s time for Future Me to finally show up and do the things he has been promising he would do.  I will wake up tomorrow and stop being the shadow of the man I want to be, and start living as the man I know I can be.

Again, not sure if this is the right place for this or if anyone cares, but thanks for reading.

",26,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/tktww/try_something_new_for_30_days/,"I while ago, I stumbled across a TED talk that really inspired me... really got me excited. Matt Cutts, a computer scientist was stuck in a rutt. So, he started making these 30-day challenged for himself. He tried something new, every month, and did it for 30 days. 30 days is just long enough to develop a new habit, or subtract an unappealing one. 

You can watch the short video here: http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html

I haven't gotten started on any challenged until recently, but I'm really excited to start remembering my months, and getting good at things, trying new things, and taking risks. 


So far on my list of things to try? 
-Learn to play guitar
-Be a vegitarian for a month
-Write a novel
-Take a picture a day
-Tell someone I love them every day
-Learn a new language
-Meet someone new
-Cut out TV/Computer/Video Games
-Learn to do magic tricks
-Help someone once a day


Ect. :)

I was teaching design and helping students realize their dreams at the expense of the personal energy of realizing mine. Helping solve 60 problems leaves you no will for yourself when you go home. I ate too much, I begged out, I treated my passions like hobbies and tinkered away at them. I knew but didn't know that I was slowly atrophying into a slug on a mattress devouring other people's stories. 

I moved, transferred to another school and taught there too. It was better, the students were more eager but I didn't change my habits and I was passively living. I came across the Last of Us a few months ago and it was about a society that lost its humanity because of the overwhelming need to survive and the any means necessary approach to achieve that. 

I paid off my debt last month and was glad to do so. For the first time I years I'm beholden to no one (student loans, but that's just unreal to me and who knows what will happen). I grew up in a house that declared bankruptcy twice and we moved changing schools every year from birth to middle school. My father worried about money to the point it consumed him and informed his decisions until he died at 61. I'm 34 and I realize I have had the same dread of my situation, for the longest time that no matter what happened I was going to fuck up and be a homeless bum and die on the streets. It was certain to me as the sun was going to rise tomorrow.

Now that I'm unshackled, I'm beginning to see that though I had a job the last few years and was able to afford the occasional luxury I lived like someone who had barely climbed Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. I could not shake my feelings of insecurity and danger despite my actual surroundings. I wonder if my listlessness, depression, and often blandness were results of this self-sustaining PTSD. The Last of Us gave me characters I could recognize and see in myself. 

I bring this up because I have one year left on my contract and then I can go anywhere. I have no debts, I have no kids, I have no obligations, I can figuratively do anything and the biggest worry I have now is: what do I choose? I don't think I'll be a bum now. I have goodness within me. I am capable, I am strong, I can fucking do this.",,False,self,t5_2tand,False,,,True,t3_1jnw6s,http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1jnw6s/realizing_my_potential_for_the_first_time_in_a/,

8 years ago, I was a fat little high school freshman. I was 5'6"" and 205lbs. My body fat was certified with calipers at 33%, but only because the chart our trainer had didn't go any higher.

Last year at this time I was 185lbs and 10.2% body fat at 6'0"" tall. I was in the best shape of my life. It was my greatest achievement, even beyond achieving a major life goal of being accepted into medical school.

I am now 22 years old, 200lbs and 16-17% body fat. I went from having a 6-pack and running 5 minute miles to having a gut and today I was unable to run under 7:30.

I have lost my inner animal and I despise myself for it. I have done nothing but make excuses for my laziness and gluttony and it stops today. Don't be confused- This is a selfish post. I need to make my resolve known. It needs to become a force both inside and outside of myself. The fact that you are reading this right now means that there are people in the world who, should they ever come in contact with me again, will know that I am undetermined and weak should I fail to regain what I have lost.

I cannot fail again. I can't go back to being the thing that I despised so much. I killed that man with my own sweat, blood and tears. I refuse to let him return. It's time to reclaim my fire.

PS- If anyone else out there feels this same way, message me. We can share our plans and keep each other accountable. More people, more fuel, more fire.

All the best,

1370892605.0,21,self.DecidingToBeBetter,1g2c18,I need advice. Any advice.,27,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1g2c18/i_need_advice_any_advice/,"Hello people of Reddit! 

This was written on a sticky note app on my computer and i figured it would not hurt to post it on Reddit. Sorry if any typos appear.

I'm not sure how to start this, but i suppose the best way to do so would be to ask the biggest question on my mind. Well, not necessarily big in the literal sense, big in the sense of being the main question.

Anyway, my question is: What can i do to become better? 

I suppose I should give little back story now: I'm a male, currently 17 years old, living in California, just finished high school (yay!), and currently getting ready for life. (That nearly sounded like I'm applying for some dating service). 
My high school career has been nothing special; I’m considered to be an above average guy (in intelligence) and I’ve managed to keep a 3.0 throughout my four years. I never actually tried to do my best, even in my advanced and honors classes, unless i was interested in the subject or topic of the chapters we were studying. I guess you can say that i would settle for less as long as i would meet the passing grade. i currently plan on going to a community college for general education and transfer into a UC (University of California).
Onto my social life: i never considered myself to be popular and i never attempted to. I would have friends but they weren't the kind that would end up in high places. Hell, I’m not even sure if they were the kind to have my back if shit went down. And for those who were clearly on the right track, i never tried to make a connection with. I was so laid back and in my own world, i never thought social relations meant a thing.
Onto physical appearance: I’ve been called from a 7 an 8 (out of ten). I'm not as fit as i would like to be and i work out every day. I’m sure my diet is the main problem as i don't have the abs i want. 
Onto my romantic experiences: i never had any. The last time i was asked out was in middle school, but my ego was so big i never gave any girl that had the courage to ask me out a chance. Or that’s what i thought. I could see now that i was afraid (no seriously, i was a wimp when it came to talking to girls up until the 11th grade). I completely fell in love with a friend during last summer and when i became brave enough to speak up, i was rejected. I called it depression what i felt after but i always managed to smile in the worst of times. I stayed for months by her side in a hopeless state but when i realized that i had to keep moving, i quit cold turkey (i think that’s how the saying goes) and broke all and any ties. i suppose i can say that this is where all of my questions began forming. 

Now, i understand that in order to motivate oneself, one must have a goal. Since childhood I’ve though of becoming a policeman, a doctor, and even a teacher. But living a life where all i do is live a cycle or routine bores me and makes me panic. My last year in high school has been the most life changing since...ever. Since that heartbreak, i realized that i can't always get what i want. And when i could, why should i settle for less. For one of our last assignments in my last English class, we had to write about our philosophy in life. I wrote about just that: why would i settle for less when i could get more. Then i went on about how i would dominate the world with that philosophy in mind and the teachers loved it. They called it funny and other appreciative adjectives, but what they didn't realize was that i was being serious.
 I must move forward, i must improve. I want to see the world for what it is and meet its people.
I tend to compare myself to everyone else, not to pity or congratulate myself but to see if I’m falling behind. And from now on i would stop doing that as long as i could help it. 

Now that high school is over, i plan on improving myself. I have an open mind, and I’m willing to listen even if i disagree with one's viewpoints. I believe life should not be filled with worry or stress and that a person is not about where they come from but where they are headed.

What i want to become is mainly social. In a couple of weeks i will be travelling to Europe (France, Italy, Switzerland, and Austria). I currently read and speak English (of course), Spanish (Mexican parents), little Japanese (attempted for anime viewing purposes), and beginning Italian (buon giorno!). I plan on starting German today and many more later in life (for the purpose of taking over the world, of course). I come from a very fortunate family, and we don't necessarily have any money problems despite being lower middle class. So my main source of education in these languages comes from a torrented Rosetta Stone and cracked apps for my iPhone. 
I also just started a facebook for the purpose of keeping contacts and keeping relationships with friends (maybe even start a few). I tend to be shy but i want to become that guy who everyone wants to be around. So I’m going to any event i can and testing out what I’ve learned from r/socialskills, even though it’s not many since I’m just creating my social life. r/seduction has good tips too but I’m still too shy to make any moves on anyone I’m interested in. 

My main question reevaluated: How can i improve to become a better person?

I've been a lurker in reddit for a while and just now decided to use reddit the right way by subscribing to r/selfimprovement, r/get motivated, r/get disciplined, and other subreddits i can't name at the moment. Reddit is a marvelous place to learn and i want anyone's advice on how to improve. The world can be dominated later, for now i must make myself the very best king i can possibly become before stepping up to the throne. And i want you to give any advice as to how i should improve. Whether it be a book i should read or a quote i should know. Even tips on how to properly use social media to make, keep, or improve relationships will be greatly appreciated.

The world is full of amazing things, and i want to be there to witness them.
Sorry for any typos and unfinished ideas (not to mention the long length). Thank you for your time and advice!

My move to the US. I have been offered a job and a temporary home until I have saved enough to rent my own room near said job. 

Yes it is a family owned business where I will be working so it's not like I won't know anyone but here is the grand kicker, the thing that means a hell of a lot to me as a 24yr old that has never done anything for herself and has always had a safety net: my mom won't be there. I broke up with my bf of 6yrs and I'm giving away like 80% of my stuff so I can make the transition much easier. I'm only bringing about 10 books with me. That's unheard of, but the lack of literature will be made up with the ton of writing I'll be doing. 

I guess I'm writing this here because I need the pressure and support from people are going through the same personal challenges. My challenge is learning how to be a god damn 24yr old that can take care of herself and stop depending on others. 

If you guys have blogs or vlogs depicting your journey please let me know and we can support eachother mine is datfilmkid.wordpress.com I'll always post questions at the end so I can get to know my fellow life fighters and travellers. We are as much alike as we are unique!

I get told to just do things that I enjoy doing, but I don't enjoy doing things alone, and my friends that I love don't enjoy the same kind of things. Whenever I imagine myself having fun, it's always with a spouse. Happiness that isn't shared does not exist.

Even though I went to a period in which I had to adjust, everything went pretty smooth for me and I'm having a great time here. I didn't meet a lot of people, but the people I did meet have been really nice and I've made some good friends here.

Since about two months, another girl joined our department. She's here for a couple of months to do a project in the same group as me, and we're sharing an office. Because I knew it wasn't easy to get started in a new city, at first I asked her to join me for everything I did - going to baseball games, exploring the city etc. We're a couple of months further now, and still this girl depends on me for her whole social life. 
She's really insecure and uses me to vent about all the 'negative' things in her life. Also, when I take her out, she will tell me about all the negative things and ignore everything positive. Right now, I don't feel like taking her along to things I enjoy because her negative attitude will ruin part of the experience for me.

Do you redditors have any advice for me how I can better myself and how I can be kind to her, without letting her negativity getting me down as well?",,False,self,t5_2tand,False,,,True,t3_1i655f,http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1i655f/how_to_be_kind/,

I've spent the last 6 years having most of my social interactions on the internet and as a result, I developed a dark sense of humor (dead babies, incest, suicide,...) that disturb a lot of people. Problem is, combined with my apparent lack of expression when I tell those jokes, people tend to think I'm a psycho.
I also tend to swear a lot when I talk and I'm starting to realize that it pushes people away, especially girls.

1) Think about your darkest hour thusfar (sorry)- in a few words, how did you feel at that time?
 
2) What got you out of that mindset? 

3) What advice would you give someone else in that mindset? 

4) Are there any words of wisdom you'd like to offer to other people about life in general?

1373416481.0,14,self.DecidingToBeBetter,1hz2by,"Help, the new me is a total stranger.",15,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1hz2by/help_the_new_me_is_a_total_stranger/,"Hi DTBB. About 2-3 months ago I decided to go on a quest to find an improved version of myself, in all aspects possible. I joined NoFap for starters. I then decided to take walks, followed by upgrading my haircut/wardrobe, quit junk food, got a gym membership and quit smoking. My list of accomplishments since I started has grown huge. Trouble is I don't know who this guy is anymore.

Before doing this I have to admit that I were a somewhat slobby loner, not very intrested in how I were dressing, how my hair looked, what habits I was carrying, who I was hanging out with and so forth. Nothing really attractive about that. What I did was having focus on my interests, music production, poetry and various medium productions such as graphic design. I were quite successful for a while last year when it came to music, with support from a major act in commerical dance music. My poetry were impressive according to my local scene, and I made visible progress with my designs.

Then came the makeover process. I impress myself counting the days since I last smoked, had a glass of coke, played pocket ping pong or went to the gym. I felt great for a while. Now I feel like a total stranger towards myself.

I haven't written a single piece since, because I've been thinking ""No time, gotta go to the gym"". I can't sit down and focus on making music because the voice in my head is screaming ""GET OUT AND MEET PEOPLE INSTEAD OF SITTING HERE LIKE YOU ALWAYS HAVE"". Same goes with my designs, because only loners sit at home by their computers, even if it's for a hobby.

I seriously do not know if I like the man I've become, but I know I didn't like the man I were, hence the change. Although, the man I were knew and had focus on what he truly believed in and were passionate about. The one I've become doesn't have time to think or do so, to make time to keep improving. The man I were were an unkempt hippie with severe addictions for sugar, caffeine, tobacco, porn and video games, but had his priorities straight. The new one is a fit, good-looking and social nonsmoker who's eating and drinking healthy, but has no idea what he's doing in life which shines through. I have to pick one. I'm scared.

But in practice, it is hard.
Unconditional goodness, or even love, to others, is hard when you leave the comfort of your own chair late at night.

Every time I watch a motivational/romantic film that teaches about acts of kindness and forgiveness, or is very motivational, I feel influenced. 
I say: ""That's it. Tomorrow I'm starting a new chapter in my life. I will be a better person!"", only to find myself next day not doing as planned.

It's like a fog covers my mind. But when watching a motivating film, the story cuts through the fog and I start to be emotional, and I desire the change for better!
I like to be objective, but if I think of it in scientific terms( that some part of the brain is ""activated"" when watching films), it just turns me off even more, actually it saddens me. My only hope is then that true kindness transcends the mind and emotions.

My question is: how do I tap that desire of change for better, how do I cut through that fog ""constantly"", without the aid of a story?

I'm at a turning point in my life as I approach adulthood, and I need to change. But it seems that I'm scared.",,False,self,t5_2tand,False,,,True,t3_1g89v0,http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1g89v0/the_fog_which_covers_a_minds_ability_to_change/,

Another part is the formation of local communities where people meet regularly to form friendships and combine their efforts.  On the Goals page - http://d2bb.org/goals.htm - one of D2BB's goals is:

""to create internet and local communities of DecidingToBeBetter members, where members can meet on a regular basis and form real, lasting friendships with one another. Through these friendships, members may also share ideas, start projects, launch businesses, create classes, etc. ""

Another:

""to work together to make their local communities better through projects, good works, fund-raising drives, enhanced awareness, community-facing classes, etc. ""

Four D2BB members in the Raleigh area are meeting regularly to plan a D2BB group that will gather on Sunday mornings. This effort is being launched in conjunction with the Triangle Freethought Society (http://www.trianglefreethoughtsociety.org).

Would you like to be part of the organizing committee? If you have ideas or experience with organizing an effort like this, we would welcome your participation. Or would you like to be involved as a volunteer when the kick-off meetings occur? We will need volunteers to help with everything from refreshments to child care.

Last October after finishing reading the book [Self-Discipline in 10 days: How To Go From Thinking to Doing](http://www.amazon.com/Self-Discipline-10-days-Thinking-Doing/dp/1880115107) I was looking for an online tool that closely matched the disciplinary system described within. I couldn't find an adequate tool so I decided then that I was going to use my new found powers and create it myself.

What a ride.

I had many ups and maybe more downs, but nothing compares to the high I get when I type the url into my browser and see my hard work.

Features:

* Document goals with a rich text editor, insert image links
* Add steps to your goals to break them down
* Add Journals - this helps you review your day/week and allows you to document what changes you would like to make
* Create your own custom categories (Health, Fitness, Programming, etc) to attach to your goals
* Once a goal is completed you are awared DPoints to your categories
* Is and always will be free to use


I would really love to hear feedback from anyone who's interested in using it and once again a big thanks to everyone here.

I left High School to work full-time 7 years ago, never completed my HSD or GED and have been working a desk job that I absolutely HATE since. But I chose to stay because I valued myself and my skills at what I've been making all this time. And now, I'm done. I'm sick of it. I want to do something that I love, and I also want to have the experience of going to college. Unfortunately, I have to continue to work this mundane full-time job while going to school so it will be very challenging to handle these two very large and demanding components of my life. However, I feel now, that I am ready to make the commitment. I spent most of my young adult life working full time and partying, wasting my time and killing my brain cells; I now am deciding there are NO more excuses, no more wasting time. And fortunately for me, I can get my GED while taking courses for a degree I chose. Talk about killing two birds with one stone! 

If anyone has advice on what PT college life is like, what it takes to work full time and successfully complete school, PLEASE leave it here! I am a sponge willing to take in any and all information that I can! I NEED to make this step in my life! I'm at my quarter life crisis (24 yr old) and the time is NOW.
