1330199675.0,224,self.Cheap_Meals,q5rnn,"The '4-3-5 Method', or How to Eat Like a College Student",261,37,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/q5rnn/the_435_method_or_how_to_eat_like_a_college/,"I've posted about this before a few times in comments, but I figure it might be nice to lay the entire thing out for people. 

Back in college, I had practically no money and no time. At one point I was working three jobs so I could go to private college full time. The result was I was spending way too much money on take-out and I would go to mom or dad's house and binge, eating all their food. The situation was unworkable. The change came after, despite exercising 30 minutes every morning, I started gaining weight. 

I came up with an idea: meal planning. The idea would be to plan out exactly what I was eating ahead of time, shopping for only the ingredients I would use, and not to ever waste any food. I also liked the idea of buying in bulk to save money and I especially liked being able to micromanage nutrients and calories, something I'd never been successful in before. The first few weeks, I ate the same breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Turns out this was a mistake. We need variety, but how could I have variety while still being able to buy in bulk? 

*Four breakfasts, three lunches, and five dinners.* Shopping twice a month, I would, every shopping cycle, create a meal plan of four breakfasts, three lunches, and five dinners, and I would cycle them. The first day I would have breakfast 1, lunch 1, and dinner 1. The second day I would have breakfast 2, lunch 2, and dinner 2. The third day I would have breakfast 3, lunch 3, and dinner 3. The fourth day I would have breakfast 4, lunch 1, and dinner 4. The fifth day I would have breakfast 1, lunch 2, and dinner 5. The sixth day I would have breakfast 2, lunch 3, and dinner 1. By offsetting meals, it created the illusion of eating a varied diet, but I could still buy in bulk. 

Additionally, since I was planning all of my meals ahead of time, I could break them all down to micro and macro nutrient content so each day I could have a wide variety of vitamins and minerals and I could balance carbohydrates, protein, and fat. I could even easily count calories. 

Shopping was simply a matter of adding up all the ingredients for however many of each meal I would have and shopping for them and only them. I never threw anything out, because I ate everything. I saved money by being able to buy ingredients in bulk, especially lunch ingredients, and I chose meals that I loved eating and that were filling. 

Fortunately, we now have access to services like [LiveStrong](http://www.livestrong.com/) that help managing calories and nutrients even more closely and without having to do homework at the store. 

**Example** (this is what I'm eating for the second half of February 2012)

Breakfasts  
1) Oatmeal with dried fruit, two hard-boiled eggs, and a coffee (2 c. oatmeal, 3/4 c. dried fruit, 2 eggs, 2 Tbs. coffee)  
2) Scrambled eggs on toast with smoked salmon (4 eggs, 3/4 Tbs. butter, chives, 1/7 a small loaf of sourdough)  
3) Large fruit smoothie (4 oz. soy milk, 4 oz. pomegranate juice, 1/2 frozen banana, 4 oz. frozen strawberries, 4 oz. frozen blueberries, and 4 oz. frozen mangoes)  
4) Denver omelet (4 eggs, 1/2 Tbs. butter, 2 oz. shredded cheddar, 2 oz. shredded jack, 1/2 green bell pepper, 1/4 onion)  

Lunches  
1) Garbanzo salad (1 can garbanzo beans, 1 cucumber, 6 cherry tomatoes, 1/4 red onion, 1 clove garlic, 1 oz. feta, Italian dressing, black olives, Romaine lettuce)  
2) Tuna wrap (1 can solid tuna, 1/4 red onion, 1/2 c. parsley, olives, Romaine lettuce, olive oil, 2 Tbs. chopped black olives, 2 whole grain tortillas)  
3) Spinach and avocado salad (12 oz. baby spinach, 1 Haas avocado, 1 Tbs. cilantro, juice of 1/2 lime, 1 Roma tomato, salt and pepper, 1/4 tsp. cumin)  

Dinners  
1) Salmon filet with roasted asparagus and micro greens (1 salmon filet, olive oil, salt and pepper, 1/2 lb. asparagus, lemon, nutmeg, 1 cup microgreens)  
2) Roman chicken (2 chicken thighs, 1/2 red bell pepper. 1/2 yellow bell pepper, 1/2 can diced tomatoes, olive oil, 1 slice prosciutto, 1/4 c. white wine, dried oregano, dried thyme, 2 Tbs. parsley leaves, 1/4 c. chicken stock)  
3) Noodles with shiitake mushrooms (10 dried shiitake mushrooms, 2 baby bok choy, 1 package rice noodles, 1"" piece of ginger, soy sauce, 1 tsp,. sesame oil, white pepper)  
4) Steak and salad (sirloin cut, nut oil, 1 Tbs. butter, 1 c. arugula, 1 Roma tomato, 1 radish, salt and pepper)  
5) Chicken tostadas (1 chicken breast, 1 chipotle chile in adobo, 2 Roma tomatoes, juice of 1/2 lime, 1 clove garlic, 1 c. Romaine, 1 oz. queso fresco, olive oil, 2 whole wheat tortillas)  

It probably seems like I eat pretty damned well, but because I buy in bulk this ends up costing a lot less than it normally would. I think I spent about $130ish for all of this for half a month, and a few substitutions could easily get this down under $75. Back in college I could eat well for under $100 a month using this program. Admittedly, there was a lot of rice and beans, but it was manageable and I always looked forward to eating. 

So there you have it, the 4-3-5- Method. If you're new to buying/making food or you want to make a change, it's a good option, imho. If you have any questions, please feel free to post below.

1360013329.0,198,self.Cheap_Meals,17w18j,"Some cheap, delicious, easy ways to get more vegetables in your diet",229,31,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/17w18j/some_cheap_delicious_easy_ways_to_get_more/,"Probably almost all of us who follow this sub are not eating as many vegetables as we are supposed to. I've noticed a couple of requests for some vitamins/non-crock pot recipes lately, so I thought I'd share some ways I try to plow through all those vegetables in my fridge that I don't know what to do with. I'd like to hear your guys' ideas and collect some of your recipes for a healthier, more well-rounded diet.

Being a college student, I have had to make cheap meals for *years*. Here are some delicious, inexpensive, relatively quick ways to get your daily vitamins without breaking the bank. I look forward to hearing how you guys incorporate them!

* * *

###First and foremost, don't be afraid of frozen veggies.

Bagged broccoli, carrots, and peas keep extremely well, and they parboil them so you can spend minimal time in the kitchen. Put a few in a bowl and microwave them, or boil a pot of water to steam/boil them a couple minutes. Top with some butter, S&amp;P and serve next to your proteins and carbs. It's a great way to get some vitamins into your diet when you're feeling lazy. Frozen vegetables also work well in sautés.

Vegetables retain many of their vitamins when they are frozen, and they are usually frozen right off the plant. Vitamins in canned vegetables, however, have a tendency to break down quickly. Furthermore, when you live up north during winter, frozen vegetables can actually be better than using ""fresh,"" and in these dark months it can definitely be easier on the wallet.

* * *

###Secondly, make your own salad dressings.

It sounds intimidating, but once you get the hang of it it's not so bad. The hardest part is getting the proportion of oil to vinegar right, but that's easily remedied. For pockets that don't run very deep, even the Kraft dressings are acceptable when they go on sale; they last for months.

Here are a couple that are in my rotation:

* [Absolutely fabulous Greek/house dressing](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/absolutely-fabulous-greekhouse-dressing/detail.aspx)

* [Caesar salad supreme](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/caesar-salad-supreme/detail.aspx) - I sub ~1 tsp. fish sauce for the anchovies

* * *

###Thirdly, sauté!

This is a great way to use up any fresh (or even frozen!) veggies you happen to have on hand. It's very versatile; you can add virtually any kind of vegetable and it will taste great. You can also play around with the seasonings and use hoisin sauce, broth, miso paste, sriracha, etc. The sauce itself isn't terribly different from good ol' [teriyaki](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baked-teriyaki-chicken/detail.aspx).

**Default sauté recipe**

&gt;* 3 Tbs soy sauce
&gt;* 1 tsp sesame oil (gets kinda pricey, but a great investment if you love asian food and want to be healthy)
&gt;* 1 Tbs honey
&gt;* 2 Tbs veg. oil (I use canola: it's cheap, has a neutral flavor, and isn't terrible for your health or the environment)
&gt;* 1 package (500g, not sure in US units) tofu, cubed (can substitute chicken-we often do it with rotisserie chicken leftovers, but if you're a carnivore you could use the entire chicken, also cubed)
&gt;* Asian noodles or rice (I use udon usually, $1/package in the Asian section, or basmati rice bought in bulk - Alton Brown's recipe [found below])
&gt;* 1 onion, diced
&gt;* 2-3 cloves garlic, minced (or put through a garlic press-another great investment. Otherwise, 1/4 tsp garlic powder)
&gt;* 1 Tbs fresh ginger (~3/4 teaspoon if dried)
&gt;* 1 bell pepper, sliced
&gt;* 1 zucchini, sliced
&gt;* 1 tsp dried basil (8 or so leaves of fresh, if you're lucky enough to have that)
&gt;
&gt;1. Mix the soy sauce, sesame oil, honey (and ginger/garlic, if you used dried instead of fresh) a bowl
&gt;2. Heat up a pan on med-high, put in half of the oil. Sauté the tofu until it's golden brown, toss it a few times so it's on more than one side. This step is important for the texture of the tofu. If you're doing chicken, skip this step entirely - it's already cooked. Once the tofu is done, transfer it (or the diced chicken) into the bowl with the sauce mixture.
&gt;3. In the same pan, add the rest of the oil and sauté your onions, garlic, and ginger (if fresh - and, at this point, celery, carrots, leeks, or cabbage) for about 2 minutes.
&gt;4. Add your bell pepper (and/or broccoli, parboiled cauliflower), cook for 1 minute.
&gt;5. Add the zucchini (and/or mushrooms, green onions), cook for another minute.
&gt;6. Add the tofu and the sauce into the pan and cook for 2 minutes.
&gt;7. Add the noodles, cook for 1-2 more minutes.
&gt;8. Add basil (and spinach, if it's in your fridge), take off the heat, and serve.

Counting prep time, this can take a whole 20 minutes to prepare, and is full of vitamins and protein. Don't be afraid of tofu--it tastes great if you can cook it properly, and it's cheap as hell (at least here in Canada).

I can't find Alton Brown's recipe, but I swear I learned how to make rice from him:

**Alton Brown's perfect rice recipe**

&gt;* 1 c. rice
&gt;* 1 Tbs oil
&gt;* 2 c. **boiling** water (or broth of your flavor)
&gt;
&gt;1. Preheat a pan on med-high. While that's going, rinse rice 2-3 times. For this I use a large bowl and a small [mesh strainer](http://www.allianceonline.co.uk/product_images/LFMS0006.jpg) (you can probably find them at the dollar store). This step is CRITICAL for rice texture.
&gt;2. Boil the broth in the microwave, or the water in either a kettle or the microwave. While it's running, put the oil in the pan, followed by the rice. Move them around as the microwave is running. The goal here is to kind of toast the rice, to get them to pop, so that they impart a deeper flavor.
&gt;3. As soon as your stuff is boiling, pour it CAREFULLY into the pan. Measure it when it's at boiling temp.; if you measure it before you put it in a kettle it might come out to less liquid, and the ratio is important.
&gt;4. (Optional) add some curry if you wish, or some other flavors. Play around a bit! :)
&gt;5. Cover that pan, turn it down to low (2-3 on my stove, which goes up to 10), and leave it alone for 17 minutes. Don't even think about lifting the cover. If you do, the rice will come out dry. Leave it alone, and let it do its own thing. It works like magic. Trust me.

* * *

###Finally, soups!

Who doesn't like a nice potage when it's this cold outside? You can use lots of different kinds of veggies for these. Everything ranging from apples to sweet potatoes to broccoli, you can most definitely turn into a creamy, hearty meal. Here are a few that I've used:

* [Roasted butternut squash soup with apple and bacon](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/roasted-butternut-squash-soup-with-apples-and-bacon/detail.aspx) - By far my favorite. Not even kidding, you could easily sell this dish at $10 a bowl if you owned a restaurant.

* [Sweet potato, carrot, apple, and red lentil soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sweet-potato-carrot-apple-and-red-lentil-soup/detail.aspx)

* [Curried carrot soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/curried-carrot-soup/detail.aspx)

* [Cream of asparagus soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cream-of-fresh-asparagus-soup-ii/detail.aspx) - Frozen asparagus works perfectly here, and takes a lot less time.

* [Cream of broccoli soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-cream-of-broccoli-soup/detail.aspx)

There's a constant theme through most soups. All it takes, really, is an onion, S&amp;P, some kind of broth, and vegetable(s). Play around with the veggies, add butter and seasonings to your preference, toss in the blender, and voilà! Vitamins, vitamins everywhere!

2 packs of ramen (any flavor)

1 can of mixed vegetables (or fresh if that's your thing)

2 eggs

BBQ Sauce and Siracha

**DIRECTIONS:**

Boil the ramen noodles, drain water. Add vegetables into the noodles and stir well. Ramen noodles tend to stick together easy and it takes a bit to work the vegetables into it. Now add a generous amount of BBQ sauce and hot sauce. I used Devil's Spit BBQ sauce for the added kick. Sauce it to your liking, but the more sauce will help it stay wetter longer when you save the leftovers.

Now the key ingredient. The eggs. Scramble the two eggs in a separate bowl and then mix in both packets of the ramen seasoning. This is crucial. The egg is going to become faux-meat since it will have all the flavoring of the meat from the seasoning.

Dump the noodles/veggie mix into a frying pan. Now drizzle the egg over all the noodles. Keep stirring up now. The egg will mainly cook onto the noodles and give it some flavor, but some egg will chunk itself. Cook it for a while, some of the egg mixture won't fall through the bottom or you won't let all the noodles touch the bottom of the pan, so you'll be relying on the steam from the noodles to cook the egg. No one wants a runny egg in your noodles.

And that's it! I can get 3 plates out of it. It's not bad at all for ramen.
$.25 per pack of ramen

$.30 for two eggs

$.69 for can of vegetables

I just want the *simplest possible way* you could make this, and if I feel like it, I might add the garlic or basil or whatever I think I'd like in it. I'm not always good at determining what's truly needed for the dish and what's not, so many times this means I forego a promising meal because it looks either too difficult or, more often, too expensive.

What are some simple recipes you have that are *truly* simple?

I also posted this to /r/Cooking but I figured I will get some very different answers from r/Cheap_Meals and r/Cooking.

I'll give one of mine to start it off.

**ndstumme's Onion Soup**

Serves 3-4. Takes 1.5-2 hours.

*Ingredients*

* 3 very large yellow onions -$.90-$5.00 depending on where you live/where you buy them.
* 6 cups of beef broth (I use bouillon cubes and water) - $2.50 for a jar of 25 bouillon cubes, but you only need 6.
* 4 Tbsp butter (half a stick)
* 1 Tbsp flour
* 1 cup red wine (not sure if needed since I've never *not* used it. Could probably get away without it, but I always have wine around)
* (Optional - see below) Shredded cheese

*Price:* It's hard to price a half stick of butter, but I think overall you're looking at a meal for 4 for definitely less than $10 out of pocket, possibly less than $5. Less if you already have the broth/bouillon, butter, flour, etc.

*Directions*

* Chop the onions. 

* Put the broth in a soup pot and set it on the stove to a low heat (1 or 2 setting). 

* In a skillet or small pot melt the butter. Once melted add the onions and let them sauté til brown. I set the stove to medium heat (4 on a scale of 1-7). Stir occasionally.

This is the waiting game so turn on some tunes or, if you're me, Red vs Blue, as it will be about a half hour. If they haven't changed color after the half hour, but are adequately squishy and butter-soaked I usually call that good and move on to the next step.

* Add the flour to the onions and stir. Mixed well it will create a thicker onion-paste. Let cook for a few more minutes. Add the wine to the onions and stir to de-glaze them a bit, then add the whole mixture to the broth.

Time for more waiting. Let it simmer on a 2 or 3 for another half hour to an hour. Stir occasionally. After that it's done.

It's truly that simple: saute onions, add them to broth, and let it sit forever. Five ingredients. No spices unless wanted.

Now, once it's cooked I like to add some shredded cheese to my bowl, usually white cheddar. I list this as an optional ingredient, however, because it's not needed, and it works just fine without the cheese. Doesn't work so fine without the flour.

EDIT: added more details to comply with the spirit of /r/Cheap_Meals

EDIT2: You guys have some great ideas here. I'm gonna have to slowly work my way down the list and try them. Sometimes it's nice to share something that you might not even consider a recipe.

First of all, if you can, shop at an Asian grocery store for specialty items and produce to save money. I don't spend more than $2.50 on a bottle of fish sauce, $3.50/lb on Chinese eggplant, $1 on a can of coconut milk, 10 cents on a jalapeno or 15 cents for a piece of ginger at my local Asian grocer. Big chains jack up the prices on ""international"" food.


Makes 8-10 servings:


**INGREDIENTS:**


- 2 cans coconut milk (not reduced fat) - you can add more coconut milk and use reduced fat if you want to serve as straight soup.

- Fish sauce, 1-2 tbsp (some people are freaked out by/are allergic to fish sauce, so you can substitute with soy sauce. Soy sauce will discolor the curry though).

- Salt to taste

- Pepper to taste

- Soy sauce 3 tbsp

- Sugar (white or brown both work) 1-2 tbsp

- Garlic (6 cloves) chopped

- 1 Onion chopped

- Lime juice 2 tbsp (or a lime chopped, Kaffir if you want to splurge)

- Curry paste (I prefer Mae Ploy green curry paste) 1-3 tbsp depending on how hot you want it. I do 2-3. You can start with one and add in more later with the vegetables if you don't know your spice level.

- Basil (handful or 1 tsp dried)

- Ginger (a piece about 2 inches long, can use powdered 1 tbsp to sub) finely chopped

- Cilantro (garnish)

- Vegetable oil - 1 tbsp for veggies, 1-2 for protein

- A protein 1-2 lbs (I prefer to get the fattier dark meat (legs or thighs and skin them, but really any protein works. Pork and chicken will be cheapest.)

- Vegetables/fruit/fungus you like (I cook with some combination of 3-4 of these: bell pepper (1), potatoes (4-6), bamboo shoots (1 small can), mushrooms (1/3 lb), Chinese/Japanese eggplant (1), carrots (2-3), baby corn (1 small can), 1 zucchini, 3 tomatoes... basically everything tastes better in curry)  - chopped

- 1 Jalapeno/3 Thai chili peppers sliced - (optional, for more heat) 

**COOKING:**


1) Chop protein into bite size pieces. Season with salt, pepper, and soy sauce. 

2) Cook on stove in pan on medium with 1-2 tbsp of oil until cooked through (no pink/red) and set aside.


3) Heat 1 tbsp oil in ideally a deep stock/soup pot on medium heat. Add garlic, onions, ginger and carrots if you are using those. Cook until onions become transparent.

4) Add curry paste, cook 1 minute while stirring.

5) Add in coconut milk.

6) Add in fish sauce, sugar, lime juice/lime, basil, all other vegetables, your protein, and pepper(s).

7) Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer (rolling boil, usually around 2-3/10) and cover. Cook for 25-45 minutes until protein and any hard vegetables are tender. Potatoes may take longer. I don't normally need to, but go ahead and salt and pepper to taste if you need it.

8) Garnish w/cilantro.

1372552784.0,108,self.Cheap_Meals,1hc81u,You can yogurt. I know you can.,155,47,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1hc81u/you_can_yogurt_i_know_you_can/,"This is a repost from [another thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1f8ztj/request_i_need_a_cheap_dessert_for_my_lunches/casvxiy) because I was told by my boyfriend, who has used Reddit more than I, that it should have it's own post. 

Here it is:

Everyone who told you to buy yogurt is going to end up costing you money. My boyfriend and I go through about 3/4 gallon of yogurt a week- how do we do this without owning an oil rig? Make it yourself. Don't worry, it's easy. I'll tell you what you can and can't fuck up.

YOGURT

1. Go get a little thingy of yogurt that says ""active cultures"" on it. And a quart, half-gallon, or gallon of milk of any fat get whole milk if you are not a wuss. You can fuck up the milk selection if you like, but you have to get yogurt that says ""active cultures"". This is because between us, we are too lazy to source our own yogurt critters. The big dairy companies magnanimously package their microbial minions for perpetuating yogurt in containers marked ""active cultures"". Delicious.

2. Clean two pots and a spoon. If you have a thermometer for food (goes high temp) clean that too. Don't fuck this up. Use boiling hot water and soap if you have any. (I don't always use soap)

3. Now we prepare the milk. Try not to fuck this up. It's the step with the least margin for error, but that's just because everything else is so easy. Having let it sit in the fridge for a few days so that any antibiotics and hormones and shit in the milk has had time to calm down (yogurt critters don't like to compete. Not with others, not with themselves. This is the only thing on the planet they will not tolerate, aside from a sudden move.) it is time to pasteurize the milk. This is because the milk probably still has competing microbial critters in it. Before you freak out, remember that pretty much every surface on the planet has competing microbial critters on it. Get rid of them by heating your milk up to 180F if you have a thermometer, or until it's foamy if you don't. It foams at 180 degrees. It'll be like a really big latte, according to what people who like coffee tell me when they see me making yogurt. I hate coffee.

4. Make this milk boiling easier on yourself by putting milk in a smaller pot and boiling water in a larger pot. That's why I said ""two pots"". It's because you don't have to sit there stirring for however long it takes to foam milk in a pot. When I make a gallon, it takes a bit. You can be off to the side on the internet or doing something else productive like packing lunch and glance up every so often giving it a stir, making sure you're not carmelizing (overcooking) the milk. Louis Pasteur invented this process of heating milk to kill things and it greatly extends the shelf life of milk, wine, and anything that goes bad when the wrong microbes are in it. He is why it is called ""pasteurization"".

5. After it foams, turn off the stove. Now you get to wait some. Don't worry if a weird milk-skin thing forms or has formed. You have two options: stir it in, or lift it out and discard. Apparently you can make plastic out of milk. I think that this milk skin stuff must be what they make plastic out of.

6. Now you wait. Noticing a pattern? This is a low intensity job. I bet if we got all the stoners and told them to pay attention to making yogurt, they'd still do a good job. Anyway, the milk has to cool down. If you have a gallon, it took a while to heat up, and you get to wait about an hour, to an hour and a half for it to cool down. Hooray. If you have a half gallon this will take less time, and so on for a quart. People who have more ice trays than I use ice water to cool it down. I just set a timer and make pie or something and come back to it.

7. Milk prepared? Pitch your yogurt (not into the trash, this is a brewsky term. It means ""Add your microbial critters to make your delicious shit for you"") Don't fuck this up too much, you only want a couple tablespoons if you're doing a quart, maybe only one. I'd go with one. I've never made yogurt in that small a quantity. 1/4 cup for a half gallon, 1/2 cup for a full gallon. Hey, that's like the size of a Fage container! It's like they want you to make an entire gallon of yogurt and never have to buy their stuff again. The reason why the ratio matters is because like I said up there, yogurts don't like to compete. If you start with too much yogurt, they won't process all the milk by the time they've become a giant colony, and if you start with too little, it'll take goddamn forever and you'll never keep it warm that long. Anyway, scoop the active culture yogurt into warmy-cool milk. Yogurt critters like it best at 110F. This is difficult to fuck up. They will still be fucking like yogurts (rabbits have nothing on these little horny bastards) as low as 90F and working their way through the Yogurt Sutra at 120F. I find it's easier to keep the yogurts happy if you're making a shitton of yogurt because it's harder to change the temperature of a gallon of liquid. Keep it in the oven on low with the door open, give it a warmy blanket, crock pot with the lid off and turn it on and off occasionally, whatever keeps the little bastards warm and horny. They don't like to be agitated either, so resist the urge to stir to check how they're doing. That's how they decide to go on strike.

8. Wait. Again? Yes. This time, you can go to work and come back. Or something like that. I like yogurt at 6-7 hours after pitching, it's pretty tangy without being ridiculously sour. The longer you leave it, the more whey-y it will get. It's done when you have a solid mass of white with some liquid. My favorite was this time when I forgot it in the oven, and I came back, and there was just this giant gallon sized puck when I realized. Floating in greenish water. I have no idea how long that took. It was my first time, and I had decided to put it in the fridge right off, so yogurt didn't happen for the first three or four days before I decided to put it in the oven and poof. Life continued. Like I said, it's hard to fuck this up.

9. Done waiting? Now you stir. Stir a lot. Stir thoroughly. Unless you're making Greek style yogurt and you don't have a cheese cloth. Pour the whey out first, then stir in that case. Put it into containers, label with date, and put in your fridge. You can eat it the next day once it's been set up.

If you think it's runnier than grocery store type, that's probably because it's true. This is denser than grocery store shit, because they whip it because the number one cheapest ingredient to add is air. And you didn't see ""Add chemical emulsifiers and gelatin and other shit"" anywhere in these instructions, did you? No. Your yogurt is done. You have a lot. For the price of one dinky container, you have a huge amount. I have eaten yogurts as a sweet, healthy meal. You can replace whipped cream and sour cream in your life with yogurt and be healthier for it. Make sure you save back some of your yogurt. Put that in the freezer.

1369750492.0,109,self.Cheap_Meals,1f770q,Decent $25 A Week Ingredients for 2,134,25,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1f770q/decent_25_a_week_ingredients_for_2/,"Been a long time since I posted but I see a lot of people looking for some tips so here is what I buy. I spend roughly $25 for a week of food between me and my spouse. We generally do not like processed food so these ingredients will be pretty simple. In addition to the below I do drink whey protein but I'll skip on including that.

This is basically for the people who don't know where to start eating frugally. If you print this out and bring it to the store it can help you get in the groove on the shopping side of things. Of course consult your doctor first and what not. Everything is mainly store brand/as generic as can be unless it a bogo on a name brand makes it cheaper. Often is the case for bread(thankfully as the quality difference is drastic).

* Starches:
 Rice (20lb bag), Macaroni/Spahgetti Noodles (5lb bags) , Potatos (10lb bag), Flour (for breading/frying things)
 Tortillas (8 pack medium at dollar store, 10 smalls $1 at walmart), Granola w/ Almond Cereal 12 cents an ounce at Walmart)
 Bread(local store has bogo on some type of bread weekly so I buy and freeze)
* Frozen: Brocolli + Mixed Veggies (Walmart, very inexpensive), Cheese/Meat Ravolis(suprisingly cheap dinners)
* Meat(buy raw/freeze in portions): Boneless chicken breast ($1.99lb at Walmart), Italian Sausage (Walmart $2.80 lb), Beef (avg $2.50 lb at winn-dixie in mixed packs/bogo)
* Dairy: Milk, Cheese (1 lb of block mozzarella is $3.50 here and lasts us about a week)
* Produce: Red pepper, Sweet Onion, Lettuce, Bananas, Apples, Pears
* Flavor: Pure Canola Oil, Cheap Hot Sauce, dollar store steak sauce, Spices(pretty cheap last a long time)
* Other: Tomato Sauce (Preggo is pretty cheap and no soybean oil), Eggs, dried kidney beans.
* Optional: Raspberry Ice Tea mix(Buy in big container lasts forever as we mainly drink water)

So that is it. You've made it through the store and you're off to a cheap week/month of meals depending on how much you bought and how much freezer space you have. Oh wait one last thing, before you leave buy one thing you've been craving or just want to munch on that is under $5 if you truly can afford it. We usually drop $2 bucks on a box of cookies. Whatever breaks up the monotany :) .

EDIT: Forgot Eggs + Cereal xD. Also I have had a giant bag of dried kidney beans forever so I forgot to mention.

P.S.: As many have mentioned this list will not be $25 you're first time purchasing as it leans heavily on the concept of buying in bulk to save money. For instance buying a $1 pack of noodles everytime you need it is equal to about 15 cents of noodles in the bulk package.

Start to cook about 2 cups white rice; put a little bit of butter and pepper in it when it's done

Chicken breasts, thinly sliced, throw them in a pan over medium with a little bit of butter and low-sodium store brand soy sauce. 

Steam 1 box of frozen mixed veggies

In a small pot, mix 3 tbs or so flour (or use corn starch) with 1 cup soy and 1 cup orange juice. Bring this to a boil for about a minute and then let simmer/thicken on low

1366159878.0,95,self.Cheap_Meals,1ci1af,Home made chicken pilaf - Great for students!,114,19,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1ci1af/home_made_chicken_pilaf_great_for_students/,"So my mom recently gave me the recipe for her home made chicken pilaf... I know pilaf can be made many different ways, but this one is specifically how my mom and grandma make it...

We're of Serbian decent, so I guess our cooking has a balkan flavour to it (if that exists), but this is a super tastey, super easy to cook meal. It will last a student about 3-4 days, which is great in my case because I don't have to think about dinner for a while. I'll post a pic at the bottom. 

Ingredients: 

1 red bell pepper, 1 red yellow bell pepper

2 carrots (or 3 if they're smaller)

2 yellow cooking onions

parsley

vegetable oil (or canola or olive, whichever works)

1-ish cups of white rice (I say ish because I didn't really measure)

1 tablespoon of tomato paste


Salt and pepper

Paprika (the red seasoning stuff)

Chicken drumsticks (boneless skinless, or with skin and bone, it doesn't matte. If you get it with the skin and bone the meat will slide off the bone anyway, so no need to de-bone it... I just happened to buy boneless)


Directions:

1) The first thing I did was put the rice in a bowl of water to soak while I prepped the food.

2) In a saucepan coat the bottom with the cooking oil generously... but not more than a couple of millimetres

3) Finely chop the onions and put them in the saucepan on low heat (I put it on low heat because I didn't chop all my ingredients beforehand, I just chopped as it was on the stove)

4) Finely chop the carrots, peppers, and parsley, and add to the saucepan, bringing the temperature up to medium heat

Don't forget to stir often!!!

5) Add a tablespoon of tomato paste into the mixture, and add about half a cup to a cup of water (I didn't measure) to the mix. Stir it out so it's not all clumpy, it has to be even and runny. Don't add so much water so that it's like a soup, just add it so it's not thick. 

6) Add an even amount of salt and pepper and paprika (I didn't measure again, I just took my box of salt and quickly sprinkled it over the whole thing, the same with the paprika, and same with the pepper)

7) Let this cook for about 10 minutes, and stir often. While this is cooking on the stove, you can prep your chicken. Since I bought boneless skinless I just cut it up into small-medium pieces and salted it before adding it to the mix.

8) Add the chicken and stir often. Remember, you're just trying to cook it a bit, you don't need high heat so don't caramelize the onions and vegetables... the point is to soften it a bit, not make it mushy. 

9) After 5 minutes of cooking, preheat your oven to 350 degrees and get an oven safe dish with a lid ready.

10) After you've cooked it for 10 minutes, transfer the contents in the saucepan into the oven safe dish, drain the rice, and add it to the mix. Stir the rice around so its kind of distributed evenly throughout the dish. Add about half a cup of water, but again, I didn't measure. I made sure the water was slightly over the contents so it looked like it was drowning in the water. (Don't worry about the water, it will be all absorbed into the rice and the pilaf will come out sticky and amazing, and the chicken will be amazing, and you will be in pilaf heaven).

11) Set your cook time for an hour and a half, cover the dish with the lid and let it cook.

12) When its done, take out the dish, let it cool off, and then stuff your face for the next three days!

I spent about 20 odd dollars on the ingredients of this meal (I already had parsley, salt, pepper, and paprika at home), and it lasts me 3-4 days. I'd say that's pretty cheap!

Hope you try it, and enjoy!

As a 23 year-old living on my own in Washington, DC, though, I'm a little short on time, space, and money. My fridge is really small, so while my frugal upbringing taught me to only buy milk in gallon containers since it's cheaper by the ounce, that took up a lot of room. Also, if I was ever about to leave for more than a week, I'd have to chug all my leftover milk or it'd go bad.

So I started buying powdered milk. Bought in bulk, it costs about the same per-ounce as a gallon of milk. However, I save considerably in other ways because:

-The powder doesn't need refrigeration, so I make a liter of liquid milk  at a time and leave the rest of the powder wherever, which saves me lots of fridge space.

-I haven't had to walk or drive to the store to buy new milk in two months.

-I re-use the same bottle (an old wide-mouthed orange juice container) to hold the milk, which is eco-friendly.

-If I want a thick cream, I just increase the ratio of milk powder to water, no extra purchases necessary.

-It makes breakfast-on-the-go really easy and leak-free. I just toss cereal in a tupperware with some milk powder and drop it in my bag. Whenever I get wherever I'm going, I run water on it, mix it up, and shazam, I have cereal with milk!

Anyone else try this?

Step 1: Identify your local underprivileged minority group, preferably newly immigrated to your country.

Step 2: Find where they shop.

Step 3: Enjoy extremely low prices on a range of exotic foods and spices.

Let me give an example, in wales my local underprivileged minorities are Indians and Middle eastern. I've heard in Amercia it's Mexicans mostly or Portugese. Doesn't really matter. The important thing is that they are generally poorer. Now, because they're poorer they need cheap food, and their shops will try everything they can to cater to this need. 

In the Indian shops in swansea I get good onions 4kg for £1, 3 cans of tomato or beans for £1, shrimp for half the price I can find anywhere else, a 300g bag of chilli flakes for £1.59 and at least 50 different herbs and spices for £1.50/100g, which is at least 8 times the value of the best price I can find elsewhere.In the Middle Easter shops I can get huge 600g jars of olives or jalapenos for £1.60.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 
* [Our Kickstarter Campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1406680384/breakfast-with-strangers-50-meals-across-america)

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community.

**The Details**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

*www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
*www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
*twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

The stay at home house wives that write these blogs suggest planning out every meal for every member of your family for a month. 

That was a bit too much for me, but I had my husband sit down and help me plan out our meals for the next two weeks (our next pay day). We usually spend about $80 per week on groceries with random trips for things in between. I don't know how much the in between trips cost us. Today we bought absolutely everything we'll need for two weeks for $90.

The reason we spent so much more before planning our meals, was we shopped by getting what we knew we were out of and things that we thought we would cook/eat in the next few weeks. We always overestimated how much we needed on some things and underestimated on others. We ended up with expired meat, fruits, and vegetables (not tons, but I know we threw out something expired about once a week). This adds up. We bought things we never found time to cook, or never became appealing enough to eat (""oh this yogurt will be so healthy!"").

So here is how you do it:
Step 1: List what you already have in your fridge and pantry.
Step 2: Use a calendar or something to write what you will eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, and drink every day for however long. Try to choose things that you already have in your house. These need to be eaten first so they don't expire.
Step 3: Go through your meals and make a list of the things you need to buy.
Step 4: Only buy the things on your list!

Pro Tips: Use the unit price when comparing things to buy. You won't have to consider the price and the amount in the package. Whichever has the better unit price is the better deal. Also, the big sale displays don't show the unit price and are usually not better priced than what is on the aisle. I just avoid those and go to the products on the shelves.

If you plan to make three different meals that each call for a pound of meat. Don't buy 3 separate 1-lb units, buy the 3-lb unit. When you get home cut it into three chunks and put each in its own ziplock freezer bag. Unless the unit price is better for the 1-lb units. But that is unlikely.

Try putting the fresher items near the beginning of your meal plan list. Have more salads early because lettuce don't keep very long.

This is the first time I've done this, but I'm fairly confident this will help our budget. I hope it helps you too!",,False,,t5_2r7s6,False,,,True,t3_zb8al,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/zb8al/plan_better_eat_cheaper/,

[Archive.org Version](http://archive.org/stream/entertainmentco00lexgoog#page/n0/mode/2up)

I found this cookbook online when researching a recipe for Transparent Pie. It really is a goldmine for simple, easy, low ingredient recipes. The directions are a little thin on instruction but they seem pretty straight forward. For some reason they don't list all of the ingredients required in the initial ingredient list. I don't see the rhyme or reason for what ingredients they list or not. Here are some examples that look great. 

If you see any good recipes maybe post them. 

Here is another cook book from the same era with the same sort of straight forward recipes. I bet there are tons of these types of books. It was pre-Depression so maybe that's why the recipes seem pretty much like modern food which lots of cheese, milk, eggs and meat.

&gt;Cheese Pudding - this seems like cheese toast with a souffle type custard on top, yum

3 eggs

sandwich bread slices

1 cup milk

cheese

butter

salt, pepper

In casserole put a layer of light bread and butter, then a layer of cheese with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Alternate until casserole is almost full. Beat three whole eggs, add the milk, pour over the top and bake in moderate oven (I'm guessing 350 is moderate). Serve a once, if allowed to stand it will fall.

***

&gt;Golden Fleece Dip - This serves twenty, the recipe could be reduced easily

2 lbs cream cheese

1 dozen eggs

1 pint cream

salt and paprika

Melt cheese, add cream, boil well, add eggs, stir vigorously, add seasoning, serve with hot with wafers. 

***

&gt;Eggs a la Goldenrod - [I googled pictures of this, interesting. It might be good with some peas or a bit of meat](http://i.imgur.com/sjIUW.jpg)

4 hard boiled eggs

1 tbsp flour

1 tbsp butter

1 cup milk 

salt, pepper, paprika

6 pieces toast

Make a white sauce of butter, flour and milk. Add seasonings, add whites of eggs that have been chopped fine. Pour over toasted bread. Rice the egg yolks on topm add paprika. 

***
&gt;Rice Muffins


1 cup boiled rice

1 cup milk

2 eggs, beaten

5 tbsp melted butter

1 tbsp sugar

1/2 tsp salt

3 tsp baking powder

1 1/2 cup flour

Mix ingredients into soft batter, stir lightly but throughly. Drop the batter from a spoon into hot buttered muffin cups and bake. 
***
&gt;Macaroni Balls

2 tbsp butter

2 tbsp flour

1/2 cup milk

1 1/2 cups cooked macaroni

1/2 tsp salt

1/8 tsp red pepper

4 tbsp grated cheese

Cook until thick, and when cool make into balls. Roll the balls in a batter made of 1 tbsp water and a beaten egg, then in bread crumbs or shredded wheat (the latter preferred) and cook in deep fat. 

Personally I would use panko for this and maybe add a bit of brown or dried mustard. 
***
&gt;One Egg Muffins

2 cups flour

4 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp salt

2 tbsp melted butter

3 tbsp sugar 

1 cup milk

1 egg

Mix and sift dry ingredients. Add milk gradually, then egg well beaten and melted butter. Bake in buttered gem pans twenty five minutes.

What it do?

* I have a rice cooker which makes the rice part easy. If you don't, stovetop! Be sure you rinse the rice thoroughly (3-4 times) to get off the extra starch before you cook it. Let it cook, and come down to room temperature lest you burn your hands. Words of experience.
* Mix your filling however you'd like, I usually make a tuna salad filling (bare bones is tuna/mayo only) but you can add in leftovers, bbq, or have them plain dipped in soy sauce. 
* Dip your hands in salt water, grab a small handful of rice, and form it into a ball or traditional triangle. Poke your thumb into the middle where the filling will go, fill it using a spoon, and then work the hole closed (or cheat and put more rice on top).

Pretty easy to cook. Boil the yams until done, then add a little salt. It's sweet potato, it has incredible flavor

While the yams are boiling season the turkey to your liking, I used goya's adobo with some cayenne pepper to offset the sweetness with some kick. A little rose mary to give it a layer of flavor at the end. Then I used about half an onion and 6oz of mushrooms to cook with the ground turkey. Brown and remove it from heat.

Finally once yams are done and mashed. Throw the turkey mixture in first in a glass or casserole dish. Then layer about half a bag or so of the frozen vegetables then finally spread the yams over. Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes.

With awesome recipe!",88,18,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/yzu0s/cheap_complete_protein_quinoa_for_everything/,"If you reddit search Quinoa you come up with a number of things, but oddly, I didn't see any hits in cheap_meals OR budgetfood. 

For a long time now, Quinoa has been a HUGE part of my diet, and a staple in my kitchen. When bought in bulk it is VERY cheap, naturally organic, and has very high nutritional value. It is 14% by mass protein, instead of all carb like rice and pasta. It is also a complete protein, meaning has all 9 EAAs. It's also a good source of calcium, iron, etc. (see wiki article or something). 

It boils up and leaves you with something roughly resembling cous-cous (however, it is actually a seed). I genuinely prefer the taste and texture of it as a substitute in any dish that calls for rice. You can use it as a base for stir fries, bean salads, cold 'pasta' salads, etc. It would even make a great starch-type base for a caserole, instead of pasta. 

The huge benefit is that by eating this instead of rice or pasta, you are getting some serious protein, and some minerals, vitamins, etc. As I mentioned, it's also naturally organic because it has a layer of saponins on it while it is growing, so birds and insects do not consume it (apparently).

The recipe below uses another HUGE go-to item: soybeans (edamame)(shelled, frozen). They have the highest protein content of all the beans, and are an excellent addition to lots of quinoa (rice) dishes, stir fries, etc. Instead of rice and peas, quinoa and soybean has WAY better nutritional value, and tastes even better. 

My fave recipe is super cheap, very easy, and delicious (IMO):

Boil water, add 3 parts quinoa, simmer until ALMOST desired tenderness. Throw into same pot, with quinoa, 1 to 2 parts frozen SHELLED soybean (organic are often the same price or cheaper), turn heat to high. When water begins to boil again, soybeans are warm and just slightly softened, but still nice and firm. Drain, transfer to bowl. 

Add a healthy amount of butter, a bit of soy sauce, and some sriracha chilli sauce. Grab mixture in bare hands and smear it all over your face because it's so freakin good. 

Disclaimer: I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE white rice. I can easily eat just a giant bowl of white rice with some butter and a dash of salt, or, sadly, I am very happy to just mow down the rice with nothing on it at all. So my love for quinoa does not spawn from an inherent aversion to rice. It's just so much healthier that I use it instead most of the time.

1369077461.0,70,self.Cheap_Meals,1epmux,Sambal (very spicy) with Coconut Rice,85,15,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1epmux/sambal_very_spicy_with_coconut_rice/,"When I visited Malaysia, I had sambal for breakfast almost every day.  It was wrapped in a banana leaf with rice, half a hard boiled egg, some peanuts, and some anchovies. Plus the amazing sambal sauce. [Here's a good example from Singapore, served with chicken.](http://imgur.com/qDs3Ogt)

I decided to start making it once I got home and found it was very simple, delicious, filling, and pretty cheap. This recipe isn't exact, but the simplest one I've found that tastes pretty good.  

Recipe:

The Sambal - base of everything in this meal.

* 2 shallots

* 4 or 5 cloves of garlic (more if you reaaaaally like garlic)

* half a red onion (optional)

* 1/3 cup of oil (olive, veggie, whatever)

* 1 - 2 tsp Shrimp paste.  It's pretty nasty smelling, but you won't notice.  About $2/jar and will last you about 15 batches.

* 3 or 4 tbl of finely ground chili (red pepper) powder.  Get this at an asian market - you can get a pound of it for under $2.

* sugar (optional)

* tamarind juice (optional)

Obliterate the shallots, garlic, and onions in a food processor.  Head up the oil, toss the paste in, and let it let it brown for a minute or two.  Add about a half cup of very hot water to the shrimp paste and chili powder, stir.  Pour this mixture into the cooking paste and stir up.  Cook this mixture for about 15 minutes.  They key is cooking until it stops smelling like raw chili powder.  This makes it very aromatic, still very spicy, but doesn't have the bite it could.  Add a bit of sugar for a sweeter sauce (2 - 4 tbl) or some tamarind juice for some tartness.  This should make about a cup of nice, thick sauce. 

At this point you can do a few things with the sauce - toss in some shrimp and cook until done (I just use thawed, precooked shrimp) or add other things like chicken, pork, etc.  You can also start cooking potato wedges, put the sambal in over them, and cook until the sauce has dried over the surface of the taters. 

I usually serve this with coconut rice

* 2 cups of uncooked rice, medium grain

* 2 cups of water

* 1 shallot, chopped fine

* 1 - 2 pandam leaves - get these at your asian grocer as well (frozen).  weird, wonderful aromatic leaves.

* 1 can of coconut milk

Tie the pandam leaves in a knot to make them easy to take out, toss it all together in a pot, bring to a boil, cook for 15 minutes on low covered.  Awesome stuff - a little sweet, great to offset the heat of the sambal.  I've found you really only need one can of coconut milk even if you doubled this recipe.  

My wife and I have been eating this a few times a week for the past few months.  It's very simple, but has so much flavor and versatility.  I can pack it for lunch with rice, sambal, dried anchovies (deep fried until golden brown), a hard boiled egg, and some peanuts.  We can have it for dinner with pork, shrimp, whatever we have lying about.  It's good just by itself and some rice.  

WARNING:  This stuff is atomic hot.  Like, really really hot.  But it doesn't scorch your mouth.  It's hot as you eat it, but goes away very quickly.  I've made the sauce with as much as a half cup of pepper, and it's still delicious.  The key is cooking out the pepper until the flavor mellows. 

Good luck, and let me know if you get to making it!

EDIT:  Realized I left off total cost!
Per meal:  Around $4.00 for the sauce and rice.  This, of course, includes buying enough ground pepper, pandam leaves, rice, oil, and shrimp paste for about 15 batches.  It will be more expensive if you buy a small bag of rice or if you add peanuts, anchovies, meat, etc.  The shallot cost is around $1.25, $.50 for garlic, and $.99 for the coconut milk.

1lb ground beef

1 box beef Rice-A-Roni

1 onion, diced

1 clove garlic, minced

beef broth as needed (no more than 1 can)

corn starch or flour to thicken (optional)

Mix ground beef, onion, garlic, rice (set aside beef flavor packet) and any other desired spices.

Form into meatballs. Brown on all sides in a skillet. Add about an inch of beef broth and simmer. You'll need to add more beef broth every once in a while as the rice sucks it up. I don't have an exact cook time for these, but you can just give them a taste to see if the rice is soft enough for your liking.

Mix the rice seasoning packet with a bit of broth. Pour it into the skillet and simmer until it thickens up. I sometimes need to thicken it more with some corn starch or flour.

I usually serve this with mashed potatoes and corn. A tip for great instant mashed potatoes: instead of just using water, use 1:1 chicken broth and milk. Season with pepper and butter. They taste so much better than if made with water.

*Ground beef: 1.99/lb

*Rice-A-Roni: 1.00

*Beef Broth: .80

*Onion: .50

*Garlic and spices: Negligible

This makes about 4 big servings, but since the rice stretches the beef so far you could easily get more out of it. At 4 servings, it's about 1.00 per serving.

I was thinking about baked potato boats filled with ham, cheese and so on, I've tried it before, but they always turn out too dry. Maybe I should add milk or sour cream?

Make ~2 oz (1/3 cup) of dry couscous. Boil water, fluff with fork. You can make a lot ahead of time, and it keeps well in freezer or fridge. 

Blend up Garbanzo beans (drained), ~1 oz (1-2 tbsp) tahini, 1-2 oz Lemon juice, and some of the reserved bean liquid in a food processor or blender with a little bit of salt. Feel free to get creative here. Pesto, sundried tomatoes, chiles, cayenne pepper can all give you different flavors.  

Add about 1/4 cup of hummus to your couscous and add a drained can of tuna. Heat for ~1 minute. It almost resembles a healthier version of tuna helper. 

Overall cost per serving: 

* $0.37 couscous
* $0.77 tuna 
* $0.22 garbanzo beans
* $0.45 tahini 
* $0.14 lemon juice

* 1 - 2 cans of coconut milk (~$2.00)
* 1 package of chicken, or w/e meat you like. I've also used firm tofu for a vegetarian version. (i usually buy a pack of chicken breasts for ~$7.00)
* 1 yellow onion 
* garlic
* rice

optional: *(to add in while you eat)*

* thai basil
* lime
* tomato

Stir fry onions and garlic in pan. Add coconut milk and curry paste (all the spices and flavor you need are in the curry paste. Depending on how spicy you want your curry to turn out, add more or less coconut milk to dilute.)
Get rice cooking.
Cook chicken in another pan until almost done. Add chicken into sauce pan. Let simmer until chicken is totally cooked.  
If sauce needs thickening, add some flour and mix. 

When serving I like to have lime, thai basil and cooked tomatoes as add-in options. 

This serves about 4 people and costs about $4.50 each (assuming you already have a bag of rice)

1.5 cups of Minute Rice (~$0.35, I bought a 14 ounce box for $1 at CVS, while it was on sale. Using regular long grain rice would definitely make this recipe cheaper)

1.5 cups of water 

~2 tablespoons of tomato paste (~$0.20, $0.99 for a tube of tomato paste at Trader Joe's)

1 or 2 chicken bouillon cubes ($0.10-0.20, cheapest place to buy these is Walmart)

Any type of oil

2 tablespoons of minced garlic ($0.05, cheapest places to buy garlic are Asian supermarkets)

Pepper to taste (negligible)

Total: ~$0.80, 3-4 servings


Cook the garlic in a bit of oil over medium heat in a pot. Once nicely browned, add 1.5 cups of water. When the water starts to boil, add one chicken bouillon cube. Break up the cube and stir the mixture. Add another chicken bouillon cube based on personal preference. Stir 1.5 cups of Minute Rice into the broth. Cover the pot, turn off the heat, and let sit for 12 minutes. Fluff the rice. Add about two (or more) tablespoons of tomato paste and pepper to taste. Cook over low heat for an additional five minutes.

They taste better than anything you get in the store, they're ridiculously easy to grow, and the yield is ridiculous. One plant gave me over 30 potatoes. If I can do it, anyone can.

-They take a long time to cook

-They are higher in fat than breasts unless you remove the skin

I grind the chicken up in my food processor or put it through a grinder, mix with everything else, form it into 8 patties, flour them and then fry (as in I spray olive oil into the pan - I have a refillable sprayer).

Total price Approx $2.22 for 8 patties. Actually it cost me less - a low cost version of the local grocery store has just opened up right next door to a bottom dollar grocery, with the result that they are fighting for market share by prices (hence the 99¢ skinless boneless chicken breasts) and coupon (spend $20 get $10 off.) I estimate these 8 patties cost me less that 20¢ each not including the cost to cook them.

This is one of my favorite things to cook because it's easy, delicious, and chock full of bacon.

I've cut it down to a single serving, so if you've got company, just double everything.

You'll need:

* 2 eggs 
* 1/4 a yellow onion
* 2-3 strips of bacon (if bacon is out of your price range, I have a cheap fix below)
* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil (enough to coat the bottom of a 8"" non-stick skillet)
* I use some garlic salt and black pepper in the eggs before I fry them

1. Cover the bottom of an 8"" non-stick skillet with the Olive Oil on medium-low heat.
2. [Finely chop the onion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGBt3V0yvc) and dump into the skillet.
3. [Finely chop the bacon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXcf4lqC4Hw) and dump into the skillet when the onions are still pretty green (since the onions will cook slower than the bacon, it's important not to add them at the same time).
4. Toss that shit around until the onion is nice and brown and the bacon looks awesome. Then remove from heat and add the eggs and a dash of garlic salt and pepper.
5. Scramble and serve, add some toast if you're feeling frisky. It's holy god delicious on toast.

I've found that my best scramble comes out of this single-serving 8"" non-stick skillet, so I typically cook the two servings separately, but that's just me.

**No bacon? NO PROBLEM!**

I've made some pretty sweet bacon substitute using sandwich ham: Tear 2-3 thin slices of ham into little pieces and throw into the skillet and lightly cover with cinnamon sugar (I think brown sugar will also work possibly better, but this is what I've used). Fry that up and toss it about on medium-low heat. While you're frying, you'll see the sugar caramelize all over the ham, and it will start looking and smelling like delicious bacon but it will cost so much less.

Of course if you make the ""bacon"" this way, you'll want to do the onions completely separately, but if you make the bacon first you can ignore the olive oil and use the ham grease instead.

reduced summer squash/ zucchini - (.61) - Lucked out and found a pack of this. Cheap tip; go to the reduce produce section. Most of the time it's because the fresh produce that just got in is from another country. Due to health safety, two different country produce cannot be sold in the same section. So you can get perfect reduced produce for cheap (former produce associate).

So onto the recipe! 

Cook the chicken the way you like it then add in diced vegetables.Cook it anyway you like it just make sure it's not too wet or greasy. I use cooking spray.

Wash the collard green leaves in cold water and pat it dry. 

Once your mixture is cooked, let it cool for about five minutes. Spread your leaf and break off the stem. Spread hummus on it, spoon in mixture and wrap. Surprisingly it holds together really well. Just make sure to break off the thicker part of the stem

What you're making here is really just a healthy, calorie-dense and tasty nutritional paste that can then be shaped into patties and fried/grilled/baked into a burger (or repurposed for any number of other recipes). Here's the recipe I used with some basic pricing on the ingredients:

2 cans of black beans - 69 cents/can

1/2 cup cooked rice - bordering on free?

One small white onion, diced fine - 75 cents

One green bell pepper, diced fine - $1

3/4 cup breadcrumbs - 25 cents

2 eggs - 40 cents?

1 package of hamburger rolls - $1-4 dollars

spices and herbs to taste, I used chili powder, onion powder, a few cloves of garlic (crushed), cumin, salt and pepper.

Drain the beans and pour into a large bowl. Add the cooked rice, and mash rice/bean mixture with a potato masher/back of a large spoon/your hands until it achieves a paste-like consistency. Add the onions and bell pepper, stirring until uniformly mixed (most recipes call for the onion and pepper to be processed until fine in a food processor, but I don't have one so I just diced them fine). 

In a smaller bowl, beat the two eggs with the spices until combined. Add the egg mixture and the breadcrumbs to the rice/beans mixture and combine until well mixed. Form into patties and pan fry, grill or bake. I've only pan fried so I can't speak for the other methods, but with a little oil and a pan on medium heat these get a great crispy crust at about 3-5 minutes a side. 

I feel like there's a lot of room to be creative here - different spices, different beans, etc. This recipe makes a ton of portions, so even if you get a bit fancy with ingredients it will still cost between 50 cents and a dollar per serving. I added some avocado slices and clover sprouts to mine, which ups the nutritional ante without adding too much cost.

that is what is left in the wok after i ate mine so it should last another two meals at least. it is suitable for vegetarians (but in this form not for vegans, the tomato soup i used had milk in it, but i'm sure you could avoid that).

it is:

* a tin of kidney beans

* a tin of (cooked) carrots (you can boil your own of course but i didn't have time today) 

* a tin of tomato soup (you could make your own of course or use some left over soup from a previous meal)

* a red onion

* a bell pepper



what i did:

* drain the beans and the carrots

* stir-fry the peppers in the wok with some oil

* add the onions and stir-fry those too (i add the peppers a few minutes before the onions because onions fry quickly)

* when those are done, add the beans, the carrots and the soup

* simmer/""sub-simmer"" (?) for about five minutes

* eat

all in all i think it must have taken about fifteen minutes. the ingredients cost £3.72 but i had a bell pepper and two onions left over so i guess that makes it about £3 (and as you can see there is rather a lot of it).

not that this is a complicated recipe or anything particularly special - i was just pleasantly surprised at the cost and taste since i am hopeless at cooking usually :-)",,False,,t5_2r7s6,False,,,True,t3_16giqz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/16giqz/vegetablebean_thingy_3_for_3_portions/,

Here is the recipe:
2 lbs of ground beef ($7.00) 

1 large can (28 oz) of crushed tomatoes ($1.50) - does not need to be drained

1 large can (28 oz) of chili beans in chili sauce ($1.50)

1 onion ($1)

1 green pepper ($1.00)

1 jalepeno (can't remember how much this cost) 

Spices (chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, red pepper flakes, salt)

Water (enough to thin it out a little bit) 

Total cost = about $13 
Servings = Not sure how much it actually made in serving sizes, we had about 8 large bowls full and then 8 chili dogs after. 
about $1.50 per serving (?)

I hadn't planned on using it all so soon, but it looks like my grocery budget is close to nil for possibly the next four weeks, so let's get creative! :) I have 9lbs total, 6 in a roast and 3lb cut up into steaks.

I've already used it for pulled pork a few weeks ago and turned that into BBQ sandwiches and used it in chili.  Both went over well, but am looking for other ideas.

I'm not very familiar with this cut of meat and am afraid of using it poorly and ending up with tough, inedible food.  Feeding a family of 4 with two smaller kids (4,6) so need family friendly meals.  I have a decently stocked spice cupboard, rice, couscous, dried beans, pasta and chicken broth on hand.  Some veg in the freezer and plan to eek out a bit of cash to grab some more.

Some ideas I have are green chili pork, stir fry -- assuming I can pan cook it without it turning tough.

When not eating the pork we'll probably be using the 6lbs of chicken breast I have in the freezer.  My family is going to LOVE me... :-(

It's not bad till now, I love salads and I've found nearby where I live a veg street market very cheap... As you may have guessed because I'm writing in this subreddit, I'm on a real tight budget (I'm kinda focusing on a 3-4€ per day for all meals, yesh, European) and usually places like fitmeals offer ideas like ""hey this ultralowcarb dish entirely made out of unicorn meat is great!"".
I thought that maybe here I could have found some interesting new recipe to spice up my dietary habits, while trying to shed some kilos...
And whereas I've found here a ton of interesting ideas, they are usually made by pasta/rice/potatoes/bread. Something that I can truly understand since the true cheap meals usually involve mostly carbs. Something I can't indulge into!
Any idea would do for me, thanks for listening :)

Pretty much you take a box of mac and cheese and cook it normally.  While the mac is cooking, you brown some ground meat (turkey or beef is fine) along with onions and green peppers.  When the meat is done, and the onions/peppers are cooked, you throw in a can of tomato paste, a little water, and some canned corn.  Let it simmer for a bit, then combine it with the mac and cheese and you're done.  If you want to make it even cheaper, you can use beans instead of meat.

The recipe can be done all with canned foods, and tastes great.  If you use beans instead of meat, the whole thing can be done for under $5, and it feeds around 4 people.

I only got 20 hours a week for the last couple weeks, so I'm really starting to feel the pinch. I'm a bachelor and I eat alone most of the time. I don't necessarily eat healthy (6'2, 260), but I do eat cheap. 


A lot of the recipes I've seen on here rely on a well stocked pantry, something I don't always have. I got lucky this time. Here's the important things I've learned to stock up on:

* Rice. Keep a 20lb bag, buy another when it's down to a pound or two left.
* Butter. Essential for so many recipes, buy when it's on sale and stuff some in the freezer.
* Baking powder. Helloooo fresh biscuits.
* Flour. At least 5lbs on hand at all times.
* Pasta. Macaroni, rotini, rotelle, penne, linguine spaghetti, doesn't matter. Stock up when it's on sale.
* Salt, Pepper, 


Why stock all that? Because then all you've gotta do is add a little protein and you're golden. All of the above adds up to maybe $40, and it can last for weeks with just a few additional perishables:

* Milk. Evaporated or powdered can work in many recipes, but a couple need real old fashioned milk.
* Meat. I am so NOT a vegetarian it hurts. Buy it at the counter, get exactly how much you need.
* Fruit/Veg. I like my greens separate from my main dishes. Sometimes by a couple days.
* Cheese. God DAMN I love cheese.


**Homemade Sausage Biscuits.**

Cost: ~$8

Servings: 5

Leftovers Last: 2-4 days.

Not really a well balanced meal, but a delicious breakfast, and can be eaten on the go. You will have to get up early on Monday, but your biscuits should last to Friday, though by Thurs you'll have to toast them or they'll be too hard.


Ingredients: 

* 2 Cups Flour
* ~3/4 Cup milk
* 4 Tbsp Butter/Shoterning
* 1 Tbsp baking powder
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1.25lbs or so of pork sausage.

Preheat oven to about 400. I can't be sure what you actually want, I know my oven runs hot and I set it to 375. Combine flour, Baking Powder, and salt in mixing bowl. Stir until evenly mixed or run the mixture through a sifter twice. Cut in the butter or shortening. I always use butter, and just get in there with my bare hand and crumble it into the flour until I can't feel any lumps larger than 3/16ths inch or so (5mm or so for you metricheads). You can use a fork or food processor if your hands are precious. Pour the milk in slowly while mixing slowly with a fork or spoon. Never pour it all in at once, you gotta get the consitensy just right. It should be like... bread dough. Play dough that's a month old or so. It should ball up and be just barely sticky. Sprinkle it with flour and kneed 10 times. Flatten, fold, push. Separate into 5 balls, I roll mine to 4-5 inches (10-13cm) across. Bake about 15 minutes or until golden brown on the outside. If they brown before the inside's done, cook the next batch cooler for longer.

While that's baking, divide that sausage into five balls and roll it out into patties a little larger than the biscuits. yea, it's gonna be thin, but it'll work. And the thinner it is, the quicker breakfast is tomorrow morning. I usually layer the patties between some wax paper or plastic wrap so they're ready to go in the fridge. Pop a patty in the pan, split a biscuit and toast it, wrap the whole thing in a paper towel and walk out the door, breakfast in hand. When you feel a bit richer add an egg and some cheese. Can you do the same thing with biscuits in a can? Yea, but it's just nowhere near as good.


**Mac n Cheese**

cost~$5

Servings: I'll be damned if I can make this last more than four meals. Normal people should be able to make it go 6-8 servings.

Leftovers Last: 2-4 days.

Again not a well balanced meal. Might wanna eat an apple or something.


Ingredients: 

* 2 cups milk
* 4 Tbsp flour
* 4 Tbsp butter
* 1/2lb cheese. I usually use a combination of sharp cheddar and jack. FINELY SHREDDED.
* 1lb Pasta of your choice. I almost always use Rotini. So many nooks for sauce to hide.

Put your pasta water on to boil. Melt the butter over low heat in a ~1-quart saucepan. Mix in flour, and stirring constantly cook at low heat for 3 minutes or so. Slowly pour in milk, again stirring constantly. CONSTANTLY. Pasta water should have boiled by now, dump the pasta on in and cook per directions. Keep the sauce at a low simmer and stir it constantly while the pasta cooks. Definitely not a ""fire and forget"" dinner. The sauce should thicken while the pasta is cooking, once it does keep stirring until the pasta is done, then remove it from heat, drain the pasta, and stir in the cheese. If there's not enough heat to melt all of the cheese, return to heat JUST LONG ENOUGH TO MELT THE CHEESE. Pour over the pasta, mix, and enjoy. When you're richer, crumble some bacon over the top of your bowl.

2. Once it's bubbling, add the juice and stir briefly. Leave for 15 minutes

3. Line a sieve with a clean cloth. Pour the curds and whey through here. (Whey can be used the same as stock in cooking, so save it).

4. Tie the curds into a little bundle with some string, and hang it over the tap to drip overnight.

5. In the morning, squeeze out even more whey by squishing it under something heavy.

**Sag Paneer**

**Ingredients**

- the paneer you just made

- 500g frozen spinach (or chopped fresh spinach, if you don't mind the added hassle and expense)

- bit of ginger root the size of your thumb, grated.

- 6 cloves of garlic, crushed

- heaped tsp chili powder

- tsp garam masala

- 50 mls oil (at least. Indian cuisine is all about the ghee).

**Method**

1. Cut the paneer into cubes and fry it. Take care as it's quite crumbly.

2. Once the paneer is brown, fish it out of the oil and put it on a plate.

3. Put the spices and spinach in the pan, stir around for a few minutes, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. I usually don't bother defrosting the spinach.

4. Add the paneer again, and simmer for 10 minutes more.

5. Serve with rice.

Add soy sauce and white pepper to taste.

Tips:

You strain the eggs through the fork to get a good ribbon consistency, as well as giving it a stir 2-3 times before it sets in. It's removed from heat right away because the eggs are cooked as they fall into the pot.

What I do is buy the meat in bulk (I buy mega cheap ground turkey from Sam's Club, two 2.5 lb packages of it) and prepare it when I get home according to the following recipe.  Each package is 40 oz. so I just make 10 patties out of each and put them in their own sandwich bags to freeze.  I usually get home and cook one for the night and one to take to work the next day if I feel like it.  I was pretty shocked when I found out how cheap it was, especially with the meat being turkey instead of ground beef or something.

(You can obviously just halve the recipe since it's a lot o' meat.)

* 40 ounces ground turkey (I use 93/7 so it's not as dry)
* 2 cloves minced garlic (or 1 tsp garlic powder)
* 1 teaspoon basil, dried
* 1 teaspoon oregano, dried
* 2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon pepper
* any type of bread (I prefer whole wheat/grain)
* mayo and honey Dijon mustard (around 1/2 tsp of each)

1. Combine ground turkey and all seasonings, mix together well.
2. Shape 10 4oz. patties 
3. (If in the oven) Place patties on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 350^o F for 8-10 minutes or until cooked through. Be careful not to cook too long or they will become dried out.
3.5. (If on the stove) Cook on medium heat for 8-10 minutes, flipping every 3-4 minutes.
4. Toast your bread (or not) and spread mayo and honey Dijon, mixing them together well.

-Pork side (google it and you should see strips of pork that almost look like bacon, but of course, it's not cured)

-kimchi

-olive oil (just enough to coat the pan, but not too much)

Optional: 


-ko chu jang (this is korean chili paste, try googling it and there will be photos)

-OR sriracha, or other spice of your choice (salt, pepper, cajun, soy sauce, whatever you like!)

-rice as a side

The reason why I didn't specify any amount for the ingredients is because it is really not that important. 

**I stir fry pork and kimchi together in the olive oil until the pork is cooked and then I eat it with rice.** 

I make sure that the **kimchi is equal to the portion of pork sides** because I like wrapping the pork and rice in the kimchi, **but you can make it with more kimchi or more pork.** 

The chili paste and/or the sriracha (or other seasoning) is completely up to whether you think the dish needs more flavouring. I don't add more spices for several reasons: I make this dish when I'm in a rush, I'm trying to conserve my chili paste (I eat it with dried anchovies as a snack, really addicting!), I'm lazy, and I actually like eating food with the least amount of seasoning as possible (except for edos, the sambal with the chicken yakisoba is delicious). But **if you want to try the chili paste (which I recommend) just start with about two heaping spoonfuls and stir in in the pork/kimchi stir fry mixture.** 

I buy about three dollars worth of pork side for two meals and trust me, they are big portions. But the price could vary. I have big containers of homemade kimchi so I'm going to guess and round up to conclude that my meal costs about **two dollars** to make. So I guess it's still a bit expensive, but *keep in mind I eat a lot in one meal, and it's cheaper than a steak, but you still get as much meat*.

I'm not sure what the korean term for the dish is called but I guess it could be compared to fried spicy pork (dae ji go gi bbo kum). I can't be sure if it is a different way of making that dish, or if it is a completely separate dish.

Also, the kimchi can be fried with anything to make a delicious dish. I often fry the kimchi alone and add udon noodles and soy sauce. Or I fry the kimchi and add a bunch of water, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and pepper (depending on my taste) to make a really rough version of ""kimchi jigae"" (kimchi stew).

So I got into the habit a while ago of buying a heap of food when I had the cash, cooking it up and freezing individual portions for my poorer times.

This is usually best for the colder months, as I'd go for soups, stews and casseroles - but it's a good way of ensuring you've got a tasty meal waiting when you're low on cash.

I'll start with one I cooked yesterday, prices based on my local grocer - any mince will work with this though, so go with the cheapest (it's pretty healthy too):

**Meatball Hotpot - $1.67 per serve** 

*4 servings alone, 6-8 servings with starch accompaniment*

* 500g Pork Mince

* 1 can Chopped Tomatoes

* 1 can Butter Beans - drained

* 1/4 cup Tomato Paste

* 1 Medium Onion - finely chopped

* 1/2 cup Breadcrumbs (or 2 slices of toasted bread pulverised)

* 1 Egg - lightly beaten

* 1 tbsp Dried Herbs

* 2 Garlic Cloves - crushed

Preheat the oven to 180°C. Combine the mince, breadcrumbs, dried herbs, garlic and egg and mix thoroughly. Roll 1 tablespoon quantities of the mixture into balls and place in a casserole dish/oven safe pot in one layer, add the butter beans as a protective layer and place more meatballs on top (to prevent the meatballs sticking to each other).

Heat a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat - add some oil, then the onions. Cook until soft and golden. Add the tomatoes and tomato paste, stir to combine and simmer for 5 minutes, then pour over the meatballs and butter beans.

Place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes or until meatballs are cooked, then serve.

This meal is great with a starchy accompaniment to flesh it out a little, you might consider mashed potato, pasta, rice or couscous - I went with a cheesy polenta as I had some nice parmesan hanging around. The parmesan upped the budget a bit, but there are many [polenta recipes that don't require cheese](http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/ricegrains/r/polenta.htm) and if you have polenta (about $2 for 500g or 8-10 servings), a stock cube and a tap - you're there.

To make the polenta more exciting (especially without the cheese) spread your cooked polenta out into a pan about 1 1/2 inches thick and put in the fridge for a few hours or overnight. 

Once set, slice it up and grill with a little olive oil.

**Cheesy Polenta: - $1.60 per serve with cheese, 50 cents without**

*Serves 2*

* 1 cup chicken stock

* 1 cup water

* 1/2 cup instant polenta (cornmeal)

* 25g butter

* 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese

Bring chicken stock and water to the boil in a saucepan. Whisk in the polenta as you pour it slowly and gradually into the liquid. As the polenta cooks, it will expand and absorb the water.

At this point, add the cheese and butter plus some salt and pepper to taste.

Ingredients: 

1. 2 cans of great northern beans
2. Kale (you can use however much you want, but I like a lot. I usually use an entire head)
3. Olive oil
4. Garlic
5. Salt and pepper
6. Water/chicken stock/vegetable stock

Directions:

1. Drain and rinse the beans, put them in a largish pot. Add about a cup of either water, chicken stock, or vegetable stock. 
2. Finely chop a few cloves of garlic, toss them in the pot. 
3. Wash the kale, and remove it from the tough, stringy stem part. Cut or tear it into bite-size pieces. Remember it will cook down in size, so they don't need to be that small. 
4. Put the kale on top of the beans in the pot. You don't need to mix them together.
5. Bring the pot to a boil, then lower the heat and put the lid on. Let it cook until the kale is tender, usually around 15 minutes.

So, short background on me: I just started a new job, with my old one not paying me much at all. In about a month I'll get my first paycheck. In just over a week I'll get my last paycheck fom the old job. Until then I have about 10$ to buy food with.
On top of this I'm getting divorced, and I'm homeless at the moment, living on a friends couch.

I really need some advice on how to buy enough food to survive this week. Feeling shitty as it is, being hungry all the time as well just makes it worse.

Would really appreciate some advice! What's your best recipes? 

TL;DR: Got 10$ to survive a week on. What can I eat?

I notice people are still posting here. Thank you so much to everyone that has contributed!
I survived, and didn't get all too hungry during my last week.
I combined most of the advice I got, bought some essentials and managed to get along by eating one big meal every day. It was a tough time, but mostly thanks to you guys I made it. 
Again, thank you so much! 

And a special thanks to you guys who offered me money and pizzas. Even though I didn't accept it, I'm still grateful that there's people out there who are willing to help a complete stranger over the internet.

I modified it to use what we had, and, in a display of my astounding wit, I dubbed it cheddar cheese soup surprise after my girlfriend asked what we were having for dinner one night. It's as follows:

- 1 lb. ground beef or turkey @ ~$2.50/lb.
- 1 lb. pasta of your choice @ $.99/lb.
- 4 cups beef or chicken broth @ $1.70
- 2 10.5 ounce cans of condensed soup, any flavor @ ~$.99 each
- 1/2 cup of ketchup (or thereabouts) @ ~$.50

Brown the beef/chicken in deep skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Add pasta, broth, ketchup, and soup, bring to a boil. Drop the heat, cover it, and cook until the pasta is done to your liking. This will *easily* feed 4 hungry people (or last one person several days; it'll keep in the fridge for a week or so).

Tips for the ""recipe"":

- Don't stop at salt and pepper. We throw in some garlic powder, onion powder, steak seasoning, dried herbs (Italian Seasoning blend, if you know it by that name), you name it.

- If you've got some veggies lying around (broccoli, carrots, garlic, onion), throw them in! 

- If you're really strapped for cash or ingredients, sub out the broth for some water; I try to avoid bullion cubes, though, as they tend to be glorified salt licks. If you have to use them, limit them to 1-2 cubes per batch of this recipe.

- Is your concoction too runny? Mix one part cornstarch or flour to one part water up in a cup and add to the pot. Too thick? Thin it with some water. Repeat until you reach your desired consistency. 

- Throw in some cheese toward the end to add some tang and creaminess.

General food-buying tips that help me:

- Buy store-brand items. Often, you'll find that the taste will match the name-brand stuff.
- If you can help it, don't buy ground beef at Walmart. It tastes like old shoe, with a texture to match.
- If you find a low sodium version of something you were going to buy anyway, get it! Add your own salt later.
- Coupons, coupons, coupons.

TL;DR: Ground meat, pasta, canned soup. Spice it up how you like. Enjoy.

EDIT: Clarity, formatting.

Pheh.  Salt, MSG and little or no flavor, that's what bullion is.    

Canned, reduced sodium broth is a better choice.  Passably good store brands are about 50 cents.  It keeps fine in the fridge but you'll likely use it in a day or two anyway. 

Even better yet, don't pay for chicken parts; buy whole chicken.  You can find it sometimes (around these parts anyway) for 79 cents per pound.  Rarely does one have to pay more than $1.09 / pound.  

Learn how to cut it up yourself. It really is easy and takes almost no time.  Toss the parts you're not cooking tonight in sealable bags and freeze.  Even without vacuum sealing, it's fine for up to 10 days or so.  The backbone, wing tips, breast bones if you deboned the titties, and other trimmings likewise go into a bag and thence to the freezer.  I don't think the wings are useful for much on their own (two wings? WTF you gonna do with two wings?) but do wonders for the next step. 

Next time you buy a bird, do the same, adding the extra bits to your trimmings bag.  When you have an abundance of leftover parts - say two or three birds worth - toss the pile into a stock pot and cover with water. Add an onion (halved), a stalk of celery (with green leaves if possible), and a  carrot.  A finger of ginger makes a fabulous enhancement.  Do NOT add salt.  Bring it to the simmer and let it go for a few hours.  If you don't boil it, you won't have much ""scum"" to deal with but if you do get ""scum"" just skim it off.  Strain and degrease.  I measure out one cup portions into zipper bags and freeze them.   Reduce it if you like to concentrate the flavor - just let it simmer until it's down to the volume you want. 

For a variation, toss the parts into roasting pan or sheet pan then into a hot oven (425).  Break the pieces up and turn once or twice until dark golden brown.  Then use for stock as above.  The roasted flavor is out of this world.

* One boneless, skinless chicken breast -- You can also use thighs. Use 2 if they're small, but I found that 1 larger piece was plenty. Thaw ahead of time or stick it in the microwave for a bit.
* 1 cup of rice -- Use any kind you like. I prefer white or jasmine with this.
* Sriracha sauce
* Soy sauce
* Mixed vegetables -- I use **1 bag** of those SteamFresh mixed veggies, but you can use whatever you want (fresh, frozen, steam-in-bag, etc).

**Directions**

1. Cook the rice. My friend used a rice cooker for this, but I don't have one, so I just go with the good old stovetop method.

2. When your rice is about halfway done, cut up the chicken into cubes and throw it into a small pan. Put in some sriracha and soy sauce to taste. Cook the chicken in the pan, frequently turning and moving it. Leave it off the heat if it gets done a bit before the veggies.

3. Make your veggies. In my case, this just means throwing the bag of SteamFresh veggies into the microwave.

4. Move the rice into a container (with lid) when it's finished, and add the veggies when they're done as well. Then, dump the chicken &amp; sauce into the container and mix well.

This can easily be reheated in the microwave without drying it out. It makes for a really quick, cheap, and yummy meal. As an added bonus, it's not too unhealthy for you!

So here's the deal, I rent an extremely overly priced studio with nothing but a mini-fridge and microwave.  The mini-fridge works, but the freezer does not actually keep things frozen for longer than an hour.  

I'm really struggling with money on all fronts, but something I'd like to fix first is food.  I spend an ungodly amount of money of eating out every week, but I'm having a hard time finding things I can afford to cook that's cost effective.

* Swiss Cheese
* 1 carrot
* oil
* 4 small potatoes
* 1 quarter of a large red onion
* 2 table spoons butter
* Garlic. (as much as you can stand)
* spices (I used menudo mix and a pico limon shaker)
* 

 Wash taters and wrap in a WET paper towel microwave till soft.
Melt butter with grape seed or olive oil the dice  onions and chard stalks into 1/2  inch chunks fry in medium cast iron pan with liberal amounts of spices.  let them go on and fry  while your  taters nuke. Then when they are done nuking,   add your  *diced* hot taters and minced garlic to  the pan   Sir that bad boy. Now  grate the carrot into the pan and stir it around a bit. Keep  on frying.   Big red and orange color now.

Trick is, right about now that it is well cooked, you tear the chard leaves into small bits and mix into the pan.  Take Swiss cheese  grated or slices and cover the scramble with cheese.  Just before you put on the lid add 1/3 of a cup of water (or less depending on how dry you are running the pan at this point) to the hot side of the pan and quickly cover with a lid and let stand on low heat.  do not remove lid unless you hear the pan dry up then add a dash more water to keep the chard leaves steaming and the cheese melting.

I myself have given the advice plenty, but that's just a start. What kind of beans and rice? How do I prepare them? Well, that's what this thread is here for. 

I'll kick it off. I love brown rice. It's quite cheap, it's more flavorful and nutritious than white rice, and you can head in a million directions with it assuming you've prepared it correctly. Most brown rice bags come with a simple recipe for preparing, and it always involves boiling over a stovetop. While this is a perfectly reasonable way to prepare it, there's an easier, fool-proof method I'm stealing from Alton Brown: [baking](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/baked-brown-rice-recipe/index.html). It takes about an hour, but it works every time without exception. 

Once you've got baked brown rice, there are plenty of cheap ways to deal with it. I like to saute some cheap veggies, like broccoli, carrots, and peppers, and just mix them in. It can be a great, filling meal or a perfect side dish to a cheap main entrée.

Once it came to a boil, it took about 5 minutes to fully cook. I then drained it, added enough leftover tomato sauce (canned would be even cheaper) to lightly coat the pasta, and then a splash of heavy cream (could sub for milk or half&amp;half). I also seasoned to taste, which was basically just some salt, pepper, garlic powder, italian seasoning, a pinch of sugar, and a couple drops of worcestershire and hot sauce. Fresh herbs (namely basil, parsley, and thyme) definitely would've kicked it up a notch, but I forgot to add them. I think other chopped vegetables and leftover meat such as hamburger, crumbled sausage, grilled chicken, etc. would also go well in this, as would sprinkled cheese on top. Oh, and if you're gluten intolerant or would just like some added nutrition, you could certainly use quinoa or brown rice in place of the pastina.

All in all, it kinda tastes like fancy ass spaghetti-o's (plus it didn't take much more time or money to make and was slightly more nutritious). I made *way* more than I could eat, so I ended up saving at least half to be reheated tomorrow. And why am I eating straight out the pan? Because I can, that's why! (and because I need to wash dishes..) So would I make it again? Sure, but I'd make some of the adjustments that I listed above. Anyway, it's nothing spectacular, but I thought it might be worth contributing to this sub!

**ETA**: Oh, and I guess the title is a little misleading! There are no tiny tomatoes here (though they would make it 10x better), but rather tiny pasta in a tomato based sauce. Sorry for any confusion!

As for how much it cost:

I use this when I don't really feel like cooking or don't have a lot on hand. Measurements aren't all that important - it's very forgiving.
I play it by ear but usually make 2x 2qt casseroles with this recipe

What you need:

- 3/4 of a bag of elbow macaroni (more if you want and your casserole dishes are bigger than 2qt each)
- can of diced tomatoes (don't drain)
- cheese slices (like kraft, but I buy the cheap ones)
- milk, can of evaporated milk or cream - whatever you have on hand (I use 1% milk because I have it on hand, but it's intended to use canned evaporated milk to make creamier). Probably about 4 cups or so.
- one onion, diced or chopped (I prefer large onions)
- salt/pepper and any other seasonings you like
- a bit of butter or margarine, about 2Tbsp or so roughly
- optional - any leftover vegetables you have and want to include that aren't overpowering in taste.

Preheat oven to 350F
If your casserole dish is microwavable, put butter/margarine and onion in it and microwave for a few mins until onions translucent. If no microwave, saute them in a pan.

Cook pasta according to directions on package. Drain, return to pot.
Throw in the sauteed onions, can of diced tomatoes (liquid and all), salt and pepper to taste and any other veg/seasonings you're adding. Mix together and then pour into your casserole dishes.

Pour milk into casserole dishes until about 1/4 to 1/3 depth of the dish (less if you prefer firmer noodles, more if you prefer softer). Cover each casserole with cheese slices on top.

Cook in 350F oven for between 15-20 mins. It's done when the cheese topping is cooked to your liking and warmed through. Let stand about 5-10 mins on top of stove and serve.

Great as leftovers - these 2 casseroles feed my SO and I well for a few days, lunch and dinner. They reheat well in micro - just sprinkle with a little water on top before putting in micro if you like soft noodles. Serve with hot sauce if you like and have some.",,False,,t5_2r7s6,False,,,True,t3_oq6mx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/oq6mx/macaroni_cheese_and_tomato_casserole/,

Ingreadients:

* Half a box of pasta ($.75)

* 1/4 to 1/3 cup humus ($1.00 and I use sabra which is pretty expensive)

* Handful of cheddar cheese ($.25)

* Couple of tablespoons of pasta cooking water

* 1 Package frozen spinach ($1.00)

First I cooked the pasta and microwaved the spinach.  Drain the pasta but remember to save some of the cooking water.  Mix the humus, cheese, and spinach together with the pasta.  Add some cooking water if the sauce is too thick.

Fry up some sausage in a pot and break it up as much as you can. One it's about finished, add 1/3 a cup of flour into the pot and mix it up until it's evenly distributed among your sausage. Then start adding pepper, maybe a few pinches, maybe a bit more. It's up to you. 

After that, add 1 quart of milk (same as 4 cups) and put it on medium heat...it will eventually start to thicken up and once it's to the consistency you desire.

Congratulations. You have just made breakfast for a week.

I know it's not the healthiest by any stretch of the imagination. But it just might be the tastiest.

*Ingredients*

    *12 ounces pansit canton noodles (I've seen this at Walmart for about 1.50 per 12oz pkg.)

    *1 chicken breast, cooked and shredded (You can also use pork or shrimp which then changes to 1/2 pound)

    *4 tablespoons cooking oil

    *1/2 cup chopped onion

    *2 tablespoons garlic, minced
   
    *2 cups peas

    *2 cups cabbage, sliced into strips

    *1 carrot, diced

    *4 tablespoons soy sauce

    *1 tablespoon Sesame oil (Optional, I've made this before without this ingredient and it was still delicious)

    *Salt and pepper to taste




**Note: Vegetables can really be changed out to whatever you want. Sometimes I've used green beans instead of peas or even broccoli. It may not be traditional, but it was usually just whatever veggies I have around the house.**



*Cooking Instructions*

     *In a big pan or wok, sauté in oil the garlic and onions.

     *Add your choice of meat cook till cooked.

     *Snow peas, cabbage, and diced carrot. Simmer for about 10 minutes or until cooked.

     *Add the remaining Soy Sauce and the pansit canton noodles. Let simmer until noodles are soft.

     *Salt and pepper to taste, and sesame oil if you choose to use it.

     *Serve hot and enjoy.

Start small with the cayenne pepper. If it needs more you can always sprinkle a little over the chicken after you've tasted it.

- creamed coconut (this is the cheapest source of coconut milk for me, but use what works for you. This recipe needs about 2 pints (1litre) of liquid.

- Generous tablespoon Thai green curry paste (I bought a massive tub from the Chinese supermarket for a few pounds. I need to replace it about once a year.)

- bit of oil for frying

- Protein (for me, this is a 250g block of tofu. Chicken works well (I'm told). Use what you have.)

- Chopped vegetables (If I'm feeling lazy, I'll buy a prechopped pack of stirfry veg \*shames*\. Frozen cauliflower adds tasty bulk.) I usually manage to add a tin of sliced water chestnuts.

- Augmentations: this is where you add your own personal flair. Try adding grated root ginger, cashew nuts, soy sauce, fish sauce, or stock. Or whatever else you fancy.

**Method**

1. Prepare your coconut milk. I chop half a block of creamed coconut and dissolve it in 1 litre of water. If I want a richer milk, I add more coconut. But I find this is enough to get the flavour.

2. Fry your protein and curry paste in a large saucepan.

- 1 or 2 [leaves of lettuce](http://www.nefesh.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/romainelettuce1.jpg), depending on size.
- 1 [diced tomato, seeds &amp; watery-part removed.](http://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/FBB/0UA2/GUVU8OQP/FBB0UA2GUVU8OQP.LARGE.jpg)
- 1/2 a cup of [diced cucumber, seeds &amp; watery-part removed.](http://www.foodiewithfamily.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cornsalad8.jpg)
- 1 pack of [tortillas/wraps](http://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tortillas.jpg) of your choice.
- An amount (and variety) of salad dressing (or sauce) of your preference.

All ingredients used are fresh, so there is no need to cook at all!

 (Well, you may want to give your 'blank' tortillas a quick 10 second blast in the microwave to make them more pliable.)

**Method:**

- **1** - Leaving the lettuce leaves aside along with the tortilla and dressing, insert the rest of the prepared ingredients into a container that is large enough to give them a jolly good mix.

- **2** - Give the ingredients a jolly good mix.

- **3** - Place one tortilla on a plate or similar, flat serving device.

- **4** - Apply lettuce leaves to tortilla first, then spoon on some of the ingredient mix onto the lettuce leaves.

- **5** - Apply dressing/sauce atop ingredient mix.

- **6** - ""Wrap"" the tortilla to create the finished product.

- **7** - Eat (You should have some ingredient mix left over to make more wraps when needed).

**Preparation/Method Advice:**

- If you find steps 4 &amp; 6 lacking in detail, please see [this video (2:01)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiN4kiHpmvg) from YouTube user melissabranin which is very helpful. I understand people have their own favoured techniques, I include this only for those who are totally unaware of what to do.

- If you would like a video that handles preparation and method together, I would suggest [this video (8:23)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8ftjHJz1JE) from YouTube user HairNailsBeautytips; she covers every detail in under 9 minutes and also uses broccoli &amp; black beans. Easy to follow, with good guidance.

**Frugal Advice:**

- At the beginning of the week I bought all the vegetables, one bottle of ready-made dressing and a bag of 8 wraps for under £10 (Currently $15) at my local supermarket - I did not shop around; I understand you may be able to purchase the items much more cost-effectively with a little more effort.

- With 1 small, red cabbage; 1 large, red onion; 2 small lettuces; a pack of vine tomatoes; 3 medium carrots; a pack of 3 bell peppers and one cucumber I have plenty to make lunch every day, for about a week. With careful handling, portion control and correct storage, this could obviously be extended.

**General Advice:**

- On the wraps themselves: I am *definitely* an ""entry-level"" maker of meals and I thought mine were fabulous and *easily* as good as anything you can buy from a cafe or supermarket. As there is no cooking, it is hard to go wrong.

- With *your* wraps, feel free to tinker with the ingredients and amounts used; you can tailor the list quite easily and include other interesting variations such as grated cheese, cooked chicken, bacon, or whatever you fancy.

- 500g (1lb plus a bit) bag dried beans (I used a mix)
- Enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan
- 3 onions, chopped
- A whole bulb of garlic
- 1 tbsp Boullion powder (or use real stock if you have any)
- Tbsp cumin powder
- Tbsp marmite (optional)

NB: Many people are unfortunate enough to live in countries which do not have ready access to Marmite. The UN refuses to comment on this appalling human rights catastrophe. If you can't get marmite then substitute something umami tasting (e.g. chopped bacon or soy sauce)

**Method**

1. Soak the beans overnight
2. Peel the garlic cloves and slice them in half lengthways. Fry them in the oil until you smell garlic. Then add the onions and slowly fry them until they're golden brown (you don't need to stir all the time).
3. Once you're satisfied with the friedness of your onions, add the cumin, bouillon powder if using and marmite. Stir until well combined.
4. Add beans and about 3 litres of water.
5. Bring to the boil, then reduce to lowest simmer for 1 hour.
6. The soup is done when it's thick and the beans are soft.

Try it with the [egg drop soup recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/aciza/recipe_egg_drop_soup/) I posted. I bought these ingredients at a ""premium"" grocery store- you may be able to find them cheaper than I did. Most of the ingredients can be used over and over again.

**Ingredients**

* Small filet of fresh salmon - $2.00
* 1 Small Avocado - $0.50
* 1 Small Cucumber - $0.50
* Rice Vinegar - $2.00
* 2 cup White Rice
* Seaweed - $2.50 (I prefer roasted and salted)


**Method**

While the [rice is cooking](http://www.ehow.com/how_2042934_boil-rice.html), slice the raw salmon, avocado and cucumber into thin strips. When the rice is finished, douse with rice vinegar so that it sticks together well. Lay out a single sheet of seaweed and lightly cover with rice vinegar. Wet your fingers with water (so the rice doesn't stick to them) and press a thin layer of rice on top, leaving a small strip on the bottom. Lay the salmon, cucumber and avocado in strips across the center of the seaweed. Roll it toward you gently but tight, the small strip without rice will create the outside seam. 

Optional: 

Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Dip in soy sauce.

Top with Wasabi.

Top with spicy mayo (mayonaise and Sriracha sauce) 


**Notes**

This makes a lot (about four large rolls) of sushi. You'll probably have leftover rice and salmon. I always ball up the leftover rice and lay pieces of salmon on top and eat the next day.

Sausage 
4 cups chicken stock

2 eggs
Confetti Pasta (Ancini di pepe)
Parmesan Cheese  (Or Ramano- whatever is more price efficient)
1 cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast (I actually already had this on hand. If you don't- buy one of those already cooked chickens from your grocery store and use part of it and then use the rest for another meal)

Make it: 
Brown the sausage and drain the grease. Set aside. In a large pot pour the chicken stock. Heat to boiling and add the drained sausage. 
Turn down to a simmer. 
Chop the chicken breast into bite size pieces and add to chicken stock. Stir.
Chop the kale and add into chicken stock. Stir.
Cook the confetti pasta in another pot until al dente, drain, and add into the chicken stock. Stir.
Whisk the two eggs together. Stir the soup in the pot in a clock wise direction while slowly streaming the eggs in. 
That's it. 
Top it with Parmesan Cheese. It is DELICIOUS. The whole meal cost less than $10.

Curry on rice is basically the mac 'n cheese of Japan, but so, SO much better.  This recipe will easily serve six, or provide tons of leftovers.

Ingredients:

- 1 pkg [Glico Curry](http://s2.thisnext.com/media/230x230/Glico-Curry-Hot_1890B679-FAVE!-green.jpg) (I use medium, the picture is the hot variety)
- 1 or 2 potatoes, cubed
- carrot, sliced
- onion, sliced
- cooked chicken chunks
- optional spices (celery salt, garlic powder, or experiment using what you have)

The curry is a few dollars, vegetables come in under three dollars, and the most expensive portion is the protein.

We get pre-cooked chicken chunks for convenience, but I suppose you could save money by cooking the chicken yourself!

Put the onions and a bit of oil into a medium-sized pot or deep pan, like a wok.  Simmer them until they're a little soft, then pour in 2 cups of water and add the vegetables.

Boil the vegetables until the potatoes are soft, but not mushy.  It'll take about ten or fifteen minutes.  While it's boiling, I usually add in some random spices to see what happens.  The best additions so far have been celery salt (om nomnom) or garlic powder.

When the potatoes are done, there should be about a cup of water left.  Break up the Glico curry paste into smaller bricks and pop them in the water, stir a bit, then add the chicken and stir until the curry is thickened. It doesn't take long.

This curry is authentically served over plain Japanese sticky rice, but personally I enjoy it over brown rice for a little extra flavor.  When you're done, it should look a little like [this](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2241/2085836107_87e622946c.jpg).

**Ingredients** 

* Chopped Onion (to taste, I usually go for a half)
* 50g (1.7oz) Peas 
* half a diced Bell Pepper
* 3 rashers of chopped Bacon 
* 150g (5.2oz) Rice
* 0.5l (2 cups) Vegetable Stock

**Method**

1. Fry the onion in oil until it browns then add the bacon. Continue to fry for a few minutes to taste (less crispy the better, but that's just me).

2. Add the stock and rice and bring to the boil, stirring well. Then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15-20 mins until the rice is almost done.

3. Finally, add the peas, bell pepper, salt &amp; pepper to taste, and cook for another 3-4 minutes until the peas are cooked through. 

4. Serve with some grated cheese and cayenne pepper.

This gets my vote for the crispiness of the bell pepper, crunch of the bacon and hint of cayenne heat. Sometimes replace the bacon with some chopped sausage for a more meaty bite. The few ingredients and quick prep/cooking time means I fall back to it often after work.

Necessary Ingredients: Chicken (1 whole), Apples (1-2) 
Optional Ingeredients: Salt, Onions (1 onion), Cooking oil  
Cooking implements: aluminum foil or baking tray *or* [cast iron pan](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/8-cast-iron-skillet/407RSK8.html), oven, cutting board (optional), [apple slicer](http://www.rhinomart.com/apple-slicer-corer-w-ss-wholesale-item-184-g25506/) (optional).

Procedure: Buy a *whole chicken*. You can find one for about $0.99/pound in many groceries. The innards are usually already separated and placed inside the chicken; so take them out. Wash the chicken.

Preheat oven to 350F.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Steps
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take about 2 *apples* and dice them into cubes (avoiding the middle), a $1 apple slicer might be handy, if you are lazy. Put the diced cubes inside the chicken. 

Take an *onion*, cut the top and the bottom off. Peel the dry onion skin throw it away, and wash the onion in cold water. (reduces tears). Slice the onion into rings, and then, if your taste desires, dice it to any size. Stuff minced onion inside the chicken along with the apples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Use *oil* and *salt* on the *chicken* (oil the chicken on the outside and salt it).
Put the chicken on the cast iron pan or aluminum foil tray. *Note:* if you have neither, fasion one out of alimum foil. Be the alumigami master!

If you have leftover onions/apples and cooking oil, put more cooking oil in the tray and soak the remaining onion in it. Place onions around the chicken.

Put the tray/pan into the oven @350F. Take it out after about an hour and a half, or whenver it seems tasty to you.
---------------------------------------------------------------
**tl;dr**: take a chicken, put apples and onions inside, oil and salt on the outside, put into oven at 350F for 1:30 hr.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Result: tasty, juicy chicken with sweet, caramelized onion and apples.
Goes will with [Bacon Potato](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/absjn/bacon_baked_potato/) =)

Troubleshooting:

* Chicken not juicy: reduce cooking time and/or cooking temperatire
* Chicken not cooked enough: increase cooking time

----------------------------------------------------------

Total price: about $5-8 for a chicken, $1 for apples, $1 for onions -&gt; $7 -10 total

Feeds 3-6 people, depending on the size of the chicken and hunger state (equivalently, one person, up to 3 days).

2 cloves garlic (peeled and chopped, or crushed)

tsp chili powder

salt to taste

2/3 cup rice

(NB: All of these ingredients will be cheaper at an ethnic shop than a supermarket; and much cheaper if you can afford to buy in bulk.)

**Method**

1. Heat the oil in a saucepan. Fry the garlic and chili together for a couple of minutes.
2. Add the red lentils along with 3 cups of water and the turmeric. Put the lid on and bring to the boil.
3. When the lentils begin to boil, turn them down to a moderately low heat and simmer for about 20 minutes.
4. Put the rice with twice as much water in a saucepan, cover, and bring to the boil. When it boils, reduce to a moderately low heat and simmer.

**Ingredients**

2 Tbsp brown sugar  
1/2 cup oat flour  
1/2 cup flour  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp salt  
2 large eggs  
3 bananas, blended or food processed

Dash of ground ginger (optional)

Following is how I make it. Really, all you need is to get mashed bananas, oat flour, all-purpose flour, eggs and baking powder combined and cooked.

**Directions**

In a blender, combine the eggs, sour cream and bananas. Add in a bit of vanilla extract if using. Blend until smooth. 

In a food processor using the blade attachment, process a heaping 1/2 cup rolled oats until coarsely ground. Add brown sugar, all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg and ginger together and pulse a bit to mix.

Transfer wet and dry ingredients to bowl. Stir to blend.

If the mixture is too thick, add milk a few tablespoons at a time.

Preheat a pan or griddle over medium-low. (I use a cast iron skillet). Add a bit of fat (I use coconut oil).

Using a ladle, pour some batter into the pan (about 1/3 cup makes a good pancake size)

Flip pancake when underside is golden brown and cook until no longer wet inside. When the holes from bubbles on the outside edges no longer fill back in, it's time to flip the pancakes. About 3-4 minutes per side.

**THE RECIPE**

*Equipment Needed:*

* 4-6qt Slowcooker

*Ingredients:*

* 1 package of boneless, skinless Chicken Breasts
* 2 cups of cut up red potatoes
* 1 jar of salsa
* 2 tbsp of Curry Power
* Salt to taste
* Some hot sauce or sriracha
* 1/2 a package of cream cheese or 1/4 of a tub of cream cheese

*Process:*

* 1) Place chicken on the bottom of the cooker
* 2) Potatoes, salsa, curry powder, salt, and hot sauce
* 3) Gently stir the salsa and dry stuff to get it into the potatoes and avoid the chicken.
* 4) Cook for 8 hours on low, or 6 hours on high.
* 5) About 10-15 minutes before serving, add the cream cheese and stir thoroughly.  This will shred up the chicken as well.
* 6) Serve with rice!

**THE EXPENSE:**
Now, this is exactly what I use, and most of this stuff is offbrand and I'm rounding up on prices because its always better to overestimate.  I'm also not gonna count the cost for spices or rice as those are used for MANY things and I don't know how much rice anyone here uses.

* Package of Chicken          **$5**
* 5lb Bag of Red Potatoes    **$4**
* Jar of Salsa                      **$3**
* Package of Cream Cheese **$3**

* Total cost of ingredients: **$15**

Now, You can usually get the **2** cups of potatoes out of **3-4** spuds, depending on size.  So **4** batches of curry out of a bag, so thats about **$1** a batch.  And **1/2** of a package of Cream Cheese for **$1.50.**  That makes it about **$10.50** to make a batch.  I've managed to get about **8** good servings out of a batch.

* Total Cost Per Serving: **$1.31**

They are changed very slightly, but I should still give him all the credit!

2 cups paraboiled brown rice (cook 2 cups rice in simmering water for 15 mins to soften)
3 3/4 cups vegetable stock OR water (I used vegetable boullion) 
1 large tomato
1/2 large onion (or one small onion), minced
1 1/2 tbsp minced garlic
2 tbsp paprika
2-4 eggs
1 tbsp tomato paste
1/4 c olive oil
Salt &amp; Pepper, to taste

Start by slicing tomato into large wedges, and add to a bowl with 1 tbsp olive oil &amp; salt &amp; pepper. Let sit while you start chopping other veggies. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Add the rest of the olive oil to a skillet, and warm olive oil. Add garlic and onion. Cook for approx 4 min on med-high, or until onion is soft. Add tomato paste and paprika. Cook for 2 mins, stirring.

Add in rice, and cook for a few minutes to meld flavors. Then slowly add in the stock until it is just barely covering rice. Add in tomato slices in even distribution. Pour extra sauce from tomato bowl into rice. Make 2-4 small holes with a spoon. Add eggs.

Carefully transfer skillet to oven (make sure to wrap the handle in tin foil if it is platic or rubber!). Bake for 15 min, undisturbed. Take out and examine the rice, it should be firm, but cooked through at this point. If needed, add more liquid and bake longer.

Otherwise, leave out for 5-15 min, and then eat it!

*Makes approx 4 servings*

Needed:

-splash of olive oil, or vegetable oil if you prefer

-half an onion, roughly diced

-1- 796ml can of diced tomatoes

-796 ml of water

-spices (I like oregano, s&amp;p, crushed red chilly flakes, and just a dash of sugar)

-squeeze of lemon 

Sweat the onions, then once softened, sweat the carrots until some of their juice releases. Add the tomatoes and the water. Bring to a boil. Add a small amount of seasonings. 
Simmer for about 40 minutes, or until the carrots are very tender- a fork pierces them through the middle very easily. Blend until smooth. Taste, and adjust seasonings as necessary, adding a touch of lemon at the end.

1263946073.0,6,self.Cheap_Meals,aro49,Curried Veggies on the Cheap,10,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/aro49/curried_veggies_on_the_cheap/,"This is a dish I make at least once a week, especially towards the end of the week when I've got a mixed-bag of veggies in my fridge (I only go shopping once a week, usually on Sundays). I'll suggest a few veggies I like for the dish in a moment.

First, the issue of curry powder. There are tons of fantastic recipes for making your own curry powder; you can find them all over the web. However, unless you have all the ingredients needed (there are quite a few in some versions of the recipe), you're probably better off buying a pre-mixed curry powder. If you go this route, I suggest spending an extra buck or two because a) it won't be THAT expensive (less than 10 dollars, easily), b) this stuff should last you a long time anyway and c) yummy curry powder = yummy curry.

So now that we've got that out of the way, here's a list of what I like to put in my curry. What's nice about this dish is that you can use pretty much any amount of the ingredients of your choice. As you cook this dish more and more you'll figure out a balance that's best for you.

*Sweet Potatoes/Yams - These will make up the bulk of what fills you up, so go with one or two big ones (or more if you're feeding more than 2 or 3 people). Cut into bite-sized pieces (or slightly bigger if you prefer, although it might take longer to cook).

*Celery - Not a lot of flavor but they're good for you and they add a nice crunch. I usually cut up 2 or 3 stalks in cross-cut, 1/4-inch sections.

*Green Apples - Cut them into wedges (remove the core), you'll usually get 6-8 wedges per apple. I prefer Granny Smith.

*Yellow Onions - Use one or two, depending on how big they are and how much you like onion. Cut into medium-sized wedge pieces.

*Green bell peppers - These add a nice extra bit of flavor.

*Garlic - you can cut these however big you want; personally, I cut them as small as I can without spending too much time and effort.

*Optional - bouillon cube (I find that this makes the entirety of the dish more flavorful) 

*Other veggies - carrots, leeks, spinach or lettuce (to serve with or under the curry), shallots, mushrooms, bean sprouts

To Cook:

Melt butter (1/4 or 1/3 tbsp should do) in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Sautee your onions in the butter until they begin to get soft and translucent. Add your garlic and cook until that gets soft as well. Once your garlic and onion is ready, add the celery, potatoes, peppers, and apples to the pan, cooking for another couple minutes (until everything in the pan has started to come together).

Now, you'll mix in two (or more) big spoonfuls of curry powder to the pan, using enough so that everything is covered with a bit of the powder. Next, add water to the pan so that all of your food is barely covered. If you have any, add a cube of vegetable bouillon (if you don't, you might want to add a little extra curry powder). You can also substitute vegetable broth/stock for the water if you've got it (this is probably the best option but, unless you've got the broth on hand, it's not a cheap one).

Cover, and turn down the heat to a simmer. Let everything cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the potatoes become tender enough to eat (they'll be the last thing that finishes cooking, so don't worry so much about the other items).

Now that you have your curried vegetables, you can serve over rice (I like jasmine best, it's not too sticky) or noodles. If you'd like to add meat to the dish, some pieces of chicken are nice (thighs are cheap so here would be a good place to use them as you won't be able to tell the difference). Enjoy, and if you have any suggestions, questions or your own experience to add, please leave a comment.

While almost always made as a side dish, I have no problem using this as a cheap main meal. 20-30 min total time.

**Main ingredients:**

*1 can of Black Eyed Peas 

*1 can of ""french sliced"" Green Beans 

*at least 2 Bacons

*Salt / Pepper / Pepper / Pepper

*1/4 -1/2 Onion

I usually get the canned black eyed peas without greens, and the green beans without almond slivers. But I don't think that really matters.

**Cooking:**

  Start by taking 2 strips of bacon (Or a third of a package), and chop into half inch pieces or so. Put into medium pot on medium heat. Since you'll be adding a little liquid via the vegetables at the end, The crunchier your bacon ends up, the better. You should add some pepper because, pepper bacon.

  As soon as the bacon goes in, you can start prepping and chopping your onion. When it looks like there's 5 minutes left on your Bacon, add the chopped onion. Saute. Add some pepper. 10-15 min.

  When everything is nice and happy, open both cans, drain the liquid from both cans(a little bit is acceptable), and add to the bacon/onion, and some salt / pepper. Turn the heat down to Low or Medium Low and once everything is hot(5-10 min), it's ready. Add Pepper to taste.

**Optional ingredients:**

The onion is highly recommended but ultimately, not needed.

Chopped garlic: add a couple of minutes before you add the beans / peas.

Leftover meat: Chicken can really help turn this into more of a meal than a side dish. I usually add it right after the bacon, so it will heat thoroughly.


**Price:**

The canned food ranges from about 89 cents, to $1.29 each.

I got a small package of Bacon for $3.99. While only 2 strips are necessary. I used about 1/3 of the package each time I made this. With that in mind, it cost around $10 (Including onion) to make this three times.

* frozen green onions (they keep forever, good to add color and light flavor)
* frozen cheese tortellini  (got mine at Sam's in a huge bag for cheap, i'm sure cheese ravioli would have the same effect)
* chili powder

Put on a medium saucepan of water and bring to a boil.  While it's heating throw in the bouillon cube, chili powder, and green onions.  When it reaches a boil throw in as much pasta as will fit.  Boil for 5 minutes or so, cool to non mouth injuring temperature, and enjoy!

- Keep your plastic milk jugs! Rinse them out, dry thoroughly, and use them to store your bulk bought grains, pulses and other pourable, dry things (a funnel comes in handy). Convenient and vermin-proof!
- Supermarkets often reduce perishables to almost nothing near closing time. Shop then when you can.
- Rather than running out to the shop to buy what you fancy, root around in your cupboards. More than likely you have enough to make a meal.
- Buy generic and value ranges. No point paying for a label you won't eat.
- Don't chuck out anything edible. Broccoli stems are the best part of the plant. I haven't peeled potatoes for years: they're tastier, more nutritious (oh yeah, and I'm lazy). And I can't count how many people have recommended making stock from chicken carcasses in this reddit.

It's a bit uninspiring to look at, but it behaves like a flavour sponge. Also, it's 50% protein by dry weight, and really cheap to buy, even in health food shops which tend to be expensive.

This recipe makes 6 servings. Use your biggest pot.

***

**Ingredients**

- Cup and a half TVP/soy mince. (Note: on the back it may have some bullshit instructions about soaking it in water. Do not.)

- Two onions, chopped.

- Garlic, minced or crushed (at least two cloves, but more if you like garlic)

- Two cans chopped tomatoes

- Two cans beans (I used kidney and black eyed. To make it even cheaper, soak and cook dried beans)

- Two bell peppers, chopped

- Tbsp oil

- A good squeeze tomato puree if you have some.

- **Spices**: You can vary these. I used:
&gt; - 4 tsp cumin
&gt; - 3 tsp chili (I like it hot)
&gt; - tsp each whole cumin and whole coriander
&gt; - Three mysterious dried chilis I found in the cupboard. I soaked them and threw them in the blender with the tomatoes.
&gt; - a dozen shakes of Tabasco

**Method**

1. Fry the onion, garlic (and whole spices if you're using them)
2. (optional: blend the tomatoes and puree until smooth. If you like big chunks of tomato or don't have a blender, no worries)
3. Add tomatoes, TVP, peppers,beans and spices. The TVP will soak up a lot of the liquid, so add about a cup or more of water as needed.
4. Simmer with the lid on for 10 minutes.
5. Serve with rice.

Heat a can of mixed veggies and drain.

Brown some ground beef, then make a packet of brown gravy mix in with the hamburger. Throw in some onion if you want. Mix in the veggies.

Make a small serving of instant mashed potatoes, but keep it a little on the dry side.

Mix dried pancake mix (I use Bisquick) with MILK until it's thicker than pancake batter but thinner than a drop biscuit (just barely able to pour).

Pour the veggies/onion/beef/gravy into the bottom of an oven safe bowl (I've got stoneware stuff). Use your hands to 'crumble' the mashed potates over the gravy. Pour the biscuit batter over the entire thing. I left just a little room at the edges, but made sure the majority of the middle of the bowl was covered. Sprinkle on some Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.

Put into an oven preheated to 400-425F and bake until top is golden brown. Remove from oven, butter top, and allow to cool.

The final product gives a really nice difference in textures than just using mashed potato, like a lot of shepherd pies, and the potato acts as a buffer between the gravy and the biscuit batter, so it doesn't end up gooey, but still adds moisture, keeping the biscuit part from being too dry.

It's tough to estimate the cost on this since it was mostly all things I already had on hand, but I figure out of the four servings I made, maximum total cost was $3-4.00.

I like that this can be easily scaled to feed anywhere from 1 or more people, and I've always been a sucker for dishes you can cook in individual serving dishes. Who says cheap can't look classy?

I am broke right now - meaning that I have a grand total of $20 to my name until next month. I live in Australia, home of the &amp;%%$&amp; expensive groceries, and so buying food is pretty much out of the question. Thus, I am trying to figure out how to survive solely on the food that I have in my house. I know it's doable, but I was wondering if redditors could help me out in regard to making things...tastier?

A basic summary of what I have:

- White bread
- 6 cans Tunafish
- 2 packages of spaghetti
- 2 jars of tomato and herb spaghetti sauce
- 1 can of pineapple rings and 1 jar of peach slices
- 2 punnets cherry tomatoes
- 2 cans kidney beans
- 4 cans tomato soup
- 2% milk
- condiments: honey, jam, mayo, applesauce
-1kg bag of basmati rice

I can obviously think of obvious things to do with this stuff (tuna sandwiches, pasta and sauce, etc) but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas of how to MacGuyver together a decent recipe using some of the ingredients above. 

Thank you so much to anyone who can help!",,False,,t5_2r7s6,False,,,True,t3_pohhr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/pohhr/i_am_broke_and_can_only_use_what_food_i_already/,

1 box Zatarans or similar rice and beans box

1 onion

1 cup mushrooms, chopped

1 clove garlic

1 can diced tomatoes

1 Bell pepper, chopped

Possible additions: Any kind of meat, be it chicken/pork/beef, whatever. Another option instead of the oil/butter mentioned on the package is to chop up some bacon (I used 2 slices thick cut bacon, but doesn't really matter).

Fry up the onions, peppers, mushrooms and garlic in whatever fat you want to use until the onions are cooked a bit. Then add the can of tomatoes, the packet from the box, and 3 cups of whatever liquid you want to use as the cooking liquid. I just used water, but stock would work great.

Bring to a boil, add the protein if you are using one, then simmer for 25 minutes.

I prefer to cover it for the first 15 minutes, then uncovered for the remaining 10, because I like mine less saucy. If you want it saucy, then leave covered.

I also add chili powder, chili flakes if I have 'em, pepper, a bit of ginger and some paprika. This is depending on taste though.

It makes a ton of food, more than enough for at least 3 days of meals, especially if you at protein. It is also a great vegetarian option without the proteins.

1. Boil some pasta (works better with small pastas I.E. Macaroni, spirals, stuff like that. Use whole grain for the health factor, if you want)
2. Grate some cheese (I use chedder)
3. Open a can or two of tuna (you could probably use salmon or chicken or something, I've never tried it)
4. Drain cooked pasta, you can turn off the element and remove the pot from heat. Put the pasta back in the pot, stir in Tuna and Cheese, the heat from the pasta should melt the cheese.
5. This is the optional step. While I've never had it, my dad (who is the one whole shared this with me) really likes adding Jalapenos. You could probably add other peppers or veggies. I tend to keep mine pretty basic, just for cost.

The Second recipe is for the chicken..thing. This is slightly more expensive, but also delicious. I tend to make quite a bit of this, but I eat more than most, so there you are. That's why my measurements are rough.

1. Put on some rice. I use white rice, partly for the timing, but also the ease of cooking, I'm pretty lazy. That and it absorbs flavor really well, and I don't know if other rice does or not (Anyone feel liek telling me in the comments?)
2. Fry some sliced chicken breast. Boneless, skinless. You'll want them to be slightly smaller than bite sized. I tend to use 1 per person.
3 cook veggies. I use broccoli and cauliflower. sometimes I add carrots if I'm feeling exotic.
4. add a can of broccoli soup to the chicken frying pan, after that cooks for a bit, add the veggies. I often put slightly less water than the soup calls for, just to thicken it a little.

Make a bed of rice, put the chicken stuff on there. Delicious. Use bred to mop up if you want, it's pretty nice, espceially if you can get crusty bread, and you used more soup than you exactly needed. A variation I want to try sometime is to just cook the chicken breast and make that a centerpiece, pouring the soup/veggies on afterwards, all on the rice, with a little cheese on top. The other thing I do with this one is use spaghetti instead of rice, changes the taste and meal, keeps it simple.

Ingredients:

- Sausage, the cheap kind (turkey, pork, beef, veggie, etc)
- Soy sauce
- Chili flakes
- Flour (regular / white / non-rising)
- Oil
- Salt

Basically, i got one of those tubes of plain sausage that you can find at the grocery store (look in the frozen section if you don't see them with the meats).  I cooked the sausage in a frying pan with some soy sauce and chili flakes, then set aside.  In a bowl I mixed a bunch of flour with a little bit of oil, salt, and enough water that it was all in one glob but not sticky.  I used my hands after a while to kneed it until it was nice and doughy, then split it into chunks.  Using a floured plate, I rolled the chunks out to be about ten inches long and four inches wide (1/4"" thick), at which point I put some sausage down the middle and rolled it up.  I sealed the ""logs"" shut with a bit of oil and then put them in the oven for a few minutes until the dough was cooked.

The logs were surprisingly good, and the dough wasn't very greasy unlike the typical sausage rolls that you find.

First you have to do a little prep work I buy chicken thighs as they are cheap and I think they taste good. I buy a pack of 10 and marinate them with soy sauce, fresh ginger, and I throw in a couple little tins of pineapple chunks with juice. Let it marinate over night them bake them. I set thighs aside and bag the rest and put them in the fridge. Also I make four cups of rice iin the rice cooker and refrigerate it. You can make more but I usually just make enough for 2 meals worth at a time. 

Things you will needs

2 baked chicken thighs separated from the bone and chopped.  

1 small white onion chopped

3 cloves of garlic chopped

bit of ginger peeled and chopped

2 tsp dark soy sauce 

2 tsp regular soy sauce

fish sauce to taste

sugar to taste

chili garlic sauce to taste

2 cups cooked rice

2 eggs

Preparation 

I use a thin carbon steel wok but if all you have is a skillet you can make that work too. Heat up some cooking oil, when it just starts to smoke toss in your chicken, onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook until the onions start to become soft. push to the side, add a little more oil, crack in two eggs, scramble and combine with ingredients already in wok. Add fried rice, making sure to break up clumps if its cold. Add your sauces and sugar, then cook till rice is done to your liking. Serve and eat. Then just repeat through out the week with your all ready cooked chicken thighs and cooking more rice as needed. 

This meal could easily feed two people, but I am a big guy and I make meal and a late night snack out of it. The sauces are a small up front investment but they are pretty cheep. I can get fish sauce for less then 2 bucks for a big bottle of good stuff, and the most expensive will be the chili garlic sauce at usually 4 or 5 bucks a jar. I can get 10 chicken thighs for about 5 bucks, and I buy generic small tins of pineapple. I like to grill the chicken thighs the best but that takes more expensive fuel then just baking them in the oven. You can add more veggies and ingredients to your liking. This is just a basic cheap fried rice starter. Dont be scared of fish sauce if you have never cooked with it before. In the bottle it smells absolutely horrible at first until you get used to it, but in food it really accents flavors and does not taste anything like it smells like in the bottle. If you have ever eaten Vietnamese or Thai food you have probably had fish sauce and never knew it. Just be careful about how much you use because the stuff is strong, and try not to get any on your hands.

Try adding cheese or salsa or sour cream. I like to fry potatoes into it. My recipe is 1.5 cups white rice, 1 large can of pinto beans, and a few potatoes.

Help pull apart my first week of planned meals! ,2,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/uilw7/trying_to_change_my_eating_habits_and_save_money/,"I recently graduated college, and after four years of stress, poor eating, and fast times, I've decided I want to change how I treat my body. I'm not horribly overweight, but I'm dissatisfied with my eating habits and appearance. I'm currently 170lbs, and am trying to shave some of that weight off. Under current goals, I'm planning on eliminating nicotine products, processed foods/beverages, and exercising. 

Because I'm living on a fairly stringent budget, I've been in the search for...well, cheap meals (who would have thunk it!) but I'm tired of sticking to a few tried and true recipes of mine. In the past, I've lived off of nothing but pasta, poultry, and chili. I want to branch out now and put together an exact schedule of what I'll be cooking, on a week to week basis. 

My main food oriented goals include reducing my intake of meat, and increasing consumption of vegetables and grains. Currently, my diet is heavily meat oriented, with the occasional fast food for convenience's sake. Over the course of this lifestyle change, I hope to decrease my consumption of meat gradually, using smaller amounts per dish, and hopefully getting rid of my reliance on meat. While it'll still be part of my diet, I want to be able to eat multiple meat-free dishes per week. I'll be sticking to whole grain products.

I have a basic understanding of nutrition, probably a higher understanding than the average American; I'm just not sure if I'm able to balance all the necessary components of a diet without some adjustments. 

I put together my first week's schedule of eating. If anyone has any input, I'd be very grateful. Furthermore, if anyone has any pointers to spread ingredients out over multiple days (i.e., bulk shopping and creating cheap and healthy meals from the same ingredients to avoid monotony), please let me know. As it stands, there's a decent amount of overlap in my initial week's plan. 

A few quick notes: I'm not a breakfast person, hence the sparse spread. I love pasta, am not picky (aside from breakfast), and am willing to try new things. I have no food allergies (aside from mild lactose intolerance). I am a 22 year old working male, but have a decent amount of free time on my hands to cook. I do **not** have a complex kitchen setup- I live in a fraternity house with a stove/oven, microwave, a few frying pans, one large pot, enough knives for basic (albeit crude) cutting. I love cooking, and when I'm not on a budget, have a wide repertoire of meals.

I live in a house with five grown men, including myself. All of us love to eat. We love the hell out of food! Another plus is that all five of us have experience with cooking. That is to say all of us can cook, bake, boil, grill, broil, etc. and I'd like to think we're all pretty good at it. I think that between the five of us we can cook just about everything.

So here's where the dilemma comes. None of us particularly like cooking. So right off the bat we're looking to make meals that are fairly quick.

It usually goes that when one of us makes food, we make enough for everyone. So what can I make that's big? I figured rice, beans, and potatoes would be a staple in most of the meals but how can we jazz some of this up and are there any other ingredients that would change up the monotony?

We've got a stove, electric range, microwave, rice cooker, toaster oven, blender, and a George Foreman grill. We've got one skillet, one frying pan, a few baking sheets, a baking pan, and a few pots. Not much in the way of utensils but it should be enough to get the job done.

Finally, we're on a budget of $200 a month and I'm always in charge of doing the shopping.

Ingredients

1 head of cabbage

1 bag of Sauerkraut

1 small apple (Mcintosh or gala) Skinned and sliced/ julienned (you just want small pieces)

1 tbsp brown sugar

1 lb ground beef (chuck)

1 lb ground pork

1/3 cup uncooked rice

1/3 red onion, diced and briefly cooked in olive oil or bacon grease

1 can diced tomatoes

1 tsp chopped garlic

pinch of ground pepper, salt, celery salt and basil

Directions

Start by coring your cabbage and pulling the leaves off (all in one piece is best, but cracks are unavoidable).  Have a boiling pot of water ready and give each leaf a short (maybe 1 minute) bath in the boiling water.  By cooking the leaves a little bit prior to stuffing, they’ll end up much more tender rather than rubbery.
Whilst cooking your leaves mix together your pork, beef, rice, garlic, onions and other spices in a large bowl and have them ready to go once your leaves are done cooking.

In a large skillet combine your sauerkraut, tomatoes, apples and brown sugar and allow to simmer for at least 15 minutes (or until the apples are tender and have slightly sweetened the sauerkraut.
Make small (not quite golf ball sized) meatballs with your rice/ meat mixture and then place them inside a leaf (you want to start down where the large vein is/ where the cabbage would’ve been attached to the base of the head).  Begin to roll from the large vein and when you have rolled the leaf (with the meat inside) about halfway, fold your ends in and then continue rolling to the end of the leaf.  It’s just like rolling a burrito.  

Once you’ve used up all of your meat or cabbage, place your rolls into the skillet with the sauerkraut (I suggest removing a little bit of kraut from the pan prior to adding in your rolls so you can add a layer to the top of the rolls so they flavor evenly) and cover with another layer of just cabbage leaves.  This layer locks in more moisture and keeps the top of the rolls from burning as they cook.

Allow the rolls to cook in the skillet for at least 30-45 minutes (You can’t really overcook the meat since it’s such a moist environment) but I wouldn’t cook more than an hr and a half.  You can cut open a roll to check if the meat is done cooking, it will only absorb more juices that way :)

All in all, this meal costs me about $10 (if you don't count buying spices) and lasts me about a week.  It's also a relatively healthy meal, so I make it often :)

In a large heavy skillet heat the oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it brown the kielbasa. Add the cabbage and the onion and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is browned. Add 1 1/2 cups stock (I've used both vegetable and chicken and both were good) and simmer the mixture, covered partially, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender.

While the mixture is simmering, in a steamer set over boiling water steam the potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces, covered, for 12 minutes, or until they are very tender, transfer them to a bowl, and mash them with a potato masher. Add the milk, scalded, 3 tablespoons hot water, the butter, and salt and pepper to taste and stir the potato mixture until the butter is melted. Serve the kielbasa mixture on the mashed potatoes.

I liked to make salmon patties, they are so fast and easy. Unfortunately I went to that well a few too many times and my family revolted.  I got a cease and desist proclamation on my salmon patties.

Well, I recently got some panko japanese style bread crumbs.  I found them cheap at Big Lots and at an oriental food store.

So, on a whim, I decided to try breading salmon patties with the panko crumbs.

What a difference!  They tasted much better, it gave them a nice crispy crust, my family loved them and said I could make them again.

Here is my salmon patties recipe, in case you're curious, it's nothing fancy at all:

* One can of salmon 
* 1/4 finely chopped onion 
* 1 slice of bread (I use the heel from a loaf of bread)   
* 1 egg   
* 1 tbls lemon juice   
* 1 tsp thyme or rosemary  

Mix all of the above together thoroughly, making sure to smash the bones and skin so your family can't recognize them.

Form into patties.

pour a layer of panko bread crumbs on a plate, coat both sides of each patty with crumbs.

Fry in a pan with a bit of oil until golden brown on both sides.

Serve with dill sauce.


**Dill Sauce Recipe**

* 1/4 cup mayonaisse  
* 1 tbls lemon juice  
* 1 tsp dill

My budget is about 50 dollars a week, but if I can go lower, that’d be awesome. It’s not necessary, though. 

I’d really like food/meal ideas if anyone could help. I’d greatly appreciate any input you have. If anyone has questions, just ask.

As for quantities, just use one egg per bread crust. Rip up the crust into thumbnail-sized pieces and place in a bowl. Add a little bit of margarine or butter (a couple of teaspoons, maybe). Poach the eggs very gently (the middle should still be very runny). Drop the poached egg in with the crust and mix the whole lot together as much as possible.

For those who are thinking, well, what's the difference between this and eggs on toast... it's a lot!

You will need: 

One pound of beans. Use whatever beans are your favorite, but a stronger-flavored bean works better here. I usually use either blackeye peas or kidney beans.

One half pound of rice

A pound or so of your favorite cheap sausage. Slice it up. You can let it cook along with everything else and let it expand and melt its delicious fat into the soup, or if you prefer you can stick it in 15 minutes from done or boil it separately. 

One hambone. Optional, but the marrow does a lot for the flavor.

Salt

There's more than one way to cook this. I usually let it boil for 15-20 minutes then simmer for an hour and a half.

Normally I just prepare it all at once, and then just keep the leftovers in the fridge for the days after.


Prepare the pasta and bacon and cut the spring onion.

Pour the water from the pasta, and while still hot, empty the cream in it and stir, until it'll get more subtle and sauce-like. Then add the bacon and the spring onions. Voila!

What's some ideas for dense food that is efficiently digested?  I mean the smallest volume of food in your hand for a given amount of nutrition?  

Frankly skip the crap about all 'Processed food' being bad, that's exactly what I'm looking for - food that has been improved from it's natural form to be optimally ingested and absorbed by me!

**EDIT** Maybe I wasn't clear - I want ZERO preparation, and I want the entire meal's nutrition in one substance - like an energy bar.  I want to know what's out there besides energy bars, or, if they're all that's out there, which ones are actually the most complete
