A few gamer bars have started popping up over the country, like http://www.snakesandlattes.com/ and http://emporiumchicago.com/.  My idea is pretty similar: get a bar with board games and tables, some arcade machines, and maybe play e-sports on big screen TVs.  

I think KC has a big enough market to support this, but I'd love to hear some feedback on whether you'd check it out, what kind of games you'd like to see, would you want alcohol to be served, or any other insights you have.

Thanks for taking the time to read this!  

Edit:  Thank you everyone for all the comments.  I've been kicking this idea around for a while, and posted today on a whim thinking maybe a few people would chime in.  Wow!

It's easy to take your own city for granted.  

But we took our kids to the City Museum and holy hell that place is amazing!  The kids absolutely loved it.  And once we, as parents, got over the fact that our kids were just going to get lost from us but that they we could name a ""home base"" that you always come back to, we just started having fun.  We got there at about 5:00 on Saturday (about the time that anything like this in KC shuts down) and the place was packed.  On Fridays and Saturdays it's open until at least midnight (the door says 12:00, the website says 1:00AM).  

But what really stood out to us was not just that it was a crazy, mad, wild place with 4 indoor floors to run around plus a ginormous outdoor playground, and all of it made out of locally sourced salvage, but the fact that there were people of all ages coming to just play and have fun.  It was obviously a dating destination.  Teenagers to young adults were everywhere and were just playing like kids.

While I love a nice spirited discussion about our fine city's many delicious (and not so delicious) BBQ joints, I'd like to propose that we make this thread a repository that we can refer back to when this question comes up rather than rehash the same discussions each time.

With that said, here's what I propose:

**The Rules**

Each top level post should contain the name of the restaurant, **in bold**, and should cover at minimum the following topics (feel free to add more):

*What's good here*

*What's bad here*

*What to know before you show up*

**Please do not submit multiple ""top level"" posts for restaurants more than once**.  If this thread is successful, I'd like to have it referred back to when the subject of BBQ comes up.

This humble teacher was working on his lesson plans at a Westport coffee shop Saturday morning and lost his flash drive sometime during the day Saturday. This is awful timing because it had my plans for the rest of the year on it. While the plans are possible to re-do, anyone who has lost a paper and had to re-type knows how much this sucks. 

If you are in the midtown area, let me know if you or someone you know comes across it. It is red, has Scotch tape on it, and answers to the name ""Flash Drive."" 

If you help me recover it, I am willing to offer:

* A great high-five.
* A 6-pack of the beer of your choice (or refreshing soda pop if you're underage).
* Renaming one of my students after you.

So, please, keep your peepers peeled. Pound the pavement. Make t shirts. Stand on street corners railing against the injustice that has befallen me.

&gt;Look, I understand the criticism I guess. We play more new music and more songs from new artists than any station in the country. It's a fact. Compare us to stations across the country. Do it. You will see. Yes we talk and some people won't like that but others will. We will never make everyone happy. If we don't come together and try to keep this thing afloat it will sink. Plain and simple. When it does no one will miss it more than me. I feel like we have done something that no one said we could. Right smack dab in the middle of ""Mercia. Is it always perfect, no. Is it pretty fucking good? I think so. When we are gone and a new station appears maybe we will look back and realize how good we had it for 10 years.

The Buzz gets a lot of hate for various reasons.  Some of it's probably justified, some of it probably isn't.  Drive-time radio DJs have the task of filling airtime, and they tend to do that by being outsized personalities (some might say assholes).

I've really got no particular beef with Lazlo or his show (I prefer to listen to music and spend most of my time in the car listening to Pandora), but that is an awfully bold statement he made there.  Can anyone disprove it?  Is there really no other radio station in the country that plays more new music?

Our fiberhood is now ""In Progress"" and our leasing manager informed us that TWC has an exclusivity contract and we will now not get Google Fiber.  

Quick research leads me to believe this is unenforceable.  

Under federal law, cable operators and telephone companies may not “enforce or execute any provision in a contract that grants to it the exclusive right to provide any video programming service (alone or in combination with other services) to a MDU.” These illegal contract clauses deny consumers the ability to obtain service from alternative video providers.
Cable operators and telephone companies may not enforce exclusivity clauses in their existing agreements with MDU owners. Such clauses are “null and void.”

Source:  http://fiber.google.com/help/apartments/exclusivity-guidelines.html 

Anyone hearing similar issues with your condo/apartment complex?  Any success getting TWC to back down?  Thanks! 

UPDATE:  Response from Company: They know it's not enforceable. Their bank won't subject the building to a lawsuit and won't loan any money for Google Fiber.

**Google Fiber Response**:  Thank you for contacting us. I'm sorry to hear that management was unable to reach an agreement with us due to the existing contact with TWC. We've heard some reports of this and understand how frustrating it can be. 

If you had any additional questions or concerns about this, please let us know. 

Regards,
Google Fiber Team

Translation:  Nothing they can do, we are on our own.  I'm going to move when my lease is up and let my money do the talking.

Good evening. We just learned about a Google Fiber-related scam that could potentially affect you and your neighbors. We want to share what we know, so you can be aware and can inform your community. 

There is an individual attempting to scam Kansas Citians by posing as a contractor and charging for fake tree removal and trimming services. This individual is telling homeowners that they must pay for tree removal or trimming — and if you don't pay him, he is threatening to report you to the city government and revoke your access to Google Fiber.

This individual is not associated with Google Fiber in any way. Please do not pay him money or allow him to do work on your property. If you see him, call the police. 

We want to be very clear: installation of Google Fiber does not require homeowners to pay for any kind of landscaping or tree removal. Additionally, Google Fiber contractors will never ask for or require payment directly from a homeowner. If you have any additional questions about this, you can reach our customer service team 24/7 by calling
877-777-7550.

You gave my little brother the best Christmas he's had, and more importantly, you've given him hope. 


My dad has been out of a job for quite some time, and to pick up the slack my mom has been working three retail jobs. Since my mom was extremely worried she wouldn't be able to provide good gifts for this Christmas, she tried to come up with other ideas. My brother Seth has always wanted to play for K State. He's always connected with Collin, since my brother doesn't currently play QB; but aspires to reach his goal to do so like Collin did. My mom's friend has a son who goes to K State who left Collin a message about signing this football. Through the greatness of man, these dudes were able to achieve this. Not only that, but apparently this ball was inside a parked car that was hit by a drunk driver. While the car was totaled, this ball somehow survived. It's an amazing Christmas gift, and my brother broke down into tears after he realized what it really was. He thought it came from a store, and as soon as my mom said no and explained he shed his tears of glory. [Here's a picture of him right before my mom said it's real](http://i.imgur.com/RjFwj.png). There's no pictures of him after since he was embarrassed and turned his back around to hide his tears, but you guys did a truly amazing job. 


I also especially want to thank the dude(s) who delivered the note to Collin, and worked with the exchange of the ball. I'm sorry about your car man, I hope it all gets easily taken care of for you.

The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Watch from Monday, Feb. 25 at noon until Tuesday, Feb. 26 at noon. According to the Winter Storm Watch, there is potential for 6-10 inches of snow accumulation with locally higher amounts.

Please note that snow plow crews will be making a targeted push today, Sunday, Feb. 24 at 4 p.m. Residents are advised to make their best effort to remove vehicles off of streets by 4 p.m. today. City crews have also begun preparations for tomorrow’s upcoming storm.

""City crews have worked their tails off around the clock to dig out from last week's near record storm. We need residents to help us finish the job ahead of this week’s storm. Please move cars off the street if you can or follow on-street parking directions. This is a serious public safety issue. Please help one another and the City,"" said Mayor Sly James.

Residents who live in neighborhoods with on-street parking only should observe the following parking practice:

-On streets that run north/south, please park on the west side of the street.

-On streets that run east/west, please park on the north side of the street.

Should a State of Emergency be declared, vehicles parked on streets that do not comply with this configuration may be subject to ticketing and towing.

Parking vehicles off-street during snow plow operations greatly enhances the ability of snow plows to remove snow, especially in cul-de-sacs, dead ends and narrow streets. When on-street parking obstructs the ability of a snow plow to safely proceed, it is possible that the street will be skipped, causing a public safety hazard.

The City is taking such measures because it is absolutely imperative that emergency crews be able to access both primary and residential streets in an emergency. If snow plows are unable to clear a street due to vehicles parked in their way, an emergency crew would have difficulty accessing the street.

Residents are asked to let their neighbors know of today’s final snow operations push and work together to make sure their street follows correct parking practices.

To learn additional updates as they become available, along with a GPS snow plow map, please visit www.kcmo.org/snow. ",,False,,t5_2qngc,False,,,True,t3_195rxc,http://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/195rxc/want_to_avoid_getting_towed_in_kcmo_during_the/,

I myself love cycling, and try to get out to enjoy this beautiful weather on a bike whenever possible. 

However, with the large increase in cyclists, I've seen an exponential increase in dumbass cyclists. If you're on a city-street, you are obligated to obey every single traffic law that those of us in cars obey. 
Example: Stop lights. When they're red, we stop at them. 
Example: Turn lanes. We use them to turn. You may not go from a center lane and proceed to cut across lanes of traffic to make your turn. 
Example: Lighting at night. We in vehicles use lights and reflectors to alert other drivers to our presence. Obviously bicycles do not have headlights, but one can find a lighting kit at any Walmart or bicycle or store, along with reflective clothing. 

Common sense and the proper equipment can make city-cycling fun for all of us. If you don't feel that you can follow the rules, put your bike on the sidewalk. 

Remember that even at relatively low speeds, a bicycle vs vehicle wreck will cause devestating injuries to the rider, helmet or not. 

And drivers, please watch for these idiots of whom I speak, even if you shouldn't have to. The satisfaction of knowing that you didn't cause the wreck doesn't make the victim any less dead.

I was driving a black Hyundai Sonata, 2006, and had a green light. A woman driving a silver Buick Enclave (year unknown) from Grand City Rapids, Iowa was headed north on Broadway. She ran her red light and hit my car (totaling it), changing the direction of my automobile so that I was now facing north on Broadway. Her car winded up hitting the south side of the Fautless Linen Supply building on the corner of the 20th &amp; Broadway intersection.

I am looking for the witness that was kind enough to stop and check on me. He approached my car just before the firetrucks arrived. He confirmed that indeed she had run her red light as I was pretty shaken up after the accident and wanted confirmation. I am a brunette female, was wearing a black tanktop and blue polka dot skirt with black work shoes. 

I was too shaken to ask for this guy's information, or to ask him to stick around and give his statement to the officer on site, only shaking his hand as I was grateful for his kindness. He was maybe 25-30 years of age, had brown hair and was perhaps 5'9"". The back of his head can be seen in two of the images with the black Hyundai.

If you happen to know someone who said they witnessed an accident that happend at this time around this area - please forward to them. I am looking to get his statement as the driver of the Enclave has reported to her insurance that I ran a red light and that I am at fault. I am in no way able to pay for a new vehicle and all of the expenses I've thus far incurred and would greatly appreciate any witness or the witness I've described above to contact me. 

Thanks for reading and forwarding!

I have seen some of you asking for another update on GRMD and figured it would be a good time to give you one. We will continue with our plan to meetup at Longview Lake Shelter #3 on June 15th. We have the shelter from 10am to Sunset; I will arrive early to get things preped for the day and would welcome others to join in. 

I have been getting offers from a number of people about different foods they will bring. I would like to ask that everyone bring something to share: chips, deserts, drinks, etc. 
If there is a need, I will make a sign up sheet for this so we can keep better track of what people are bring so we don't end up with to much of anything. I am looking for a few individuals to pitch in $20 or so to cover the inital purchase of burgers, dogs, buns. If you are interested or can help with that let me know.

If you can't attend all day, we will kick the grill off at 12:30.

In case the of inclement weather, we will move the party to [The Brick](http://www.thebrickkcmo.com/), whether we end up at Long View or The Brick, the event will continue to be an all ages meetup.

[Here is a map of the shleter locations at Longview.](http://www.jacksongov.org/filestorage/4450/1169/1225/LongviewLake.pdf)

Any other questions, let me know!

I just moved to a typical Hyde Park house that was converted into an upper and lower apartment. We are the first tenants since a renovation took place. Prior to the renovation TWC tells me this house was turned into a 4 plex. Cool story TWC. That's crazy you know that historic bit of information but you can't seem to give me any information regarding the LACK OF INSTALLERS WITH ANY FUCKING BRAINS working for you. 

1st install. Ladder too short. 
I call TWC because - no innernette. 
""Ladder was too short. We'll come back in x days.""
X days passes. 2nd install. Ladder too short. Because we brought the same ladder. 

Same story. I recdomend a taller ladder. They bring a taller ladder and this installer brought a vagina. Because he wouldn't walk on the roof. Apparently they don't do this. Okay. 

Call back. Reschedule. Tell them to bring a lift truck. They bring it. This guy tells me on the phone he can't install because there isn't a place to run the wire to from the pole. Oh. So the huge fucking broad side of a house doesn't have any place you could run a 1/4"" cable to?! Really?!

Today I was on hold waiting for a supervisor for 37 minutes. I got bored and wanted to pet my dog. So I hung up and called back 5 minutes later. Asked for supervisor. No supervisors in. One will call me in the AM.

The event in support of the Open Internet platform is open to the public, but attendees must RSVP online at www.kauffman.org/redditbus.  

Following a complimentary dinner, reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian will lead a panel discussion featuring founders of some of Kansas City's most innovative Internet-based startups, including AgLocal, Neighbor.ly, and Leap2.

Right now, there is a poll on the KC Redditors Facebook Page with a few suggestions, with the top one right now being Blue Springs Lake Park (which, research shows, they allow alcohol, have picnic tables, a shelter and flush toilets, but no electricity; the cost is $90 to reserve the day and payment/reservation needs to be taken care of ASAP).    
 
Eisenhower Park is another option that's more centrally located and only $25 to reserve space, but may have zero toilet options (the sanitary and legal kind). Looks like people want to be able to bring adult beverages to enjoy on what promises to be a hot summer day.

Simple as that.  My ideal area to open it would be Westport, and lo and behold, the old America's Pub location (I am fully aware of the drama surrounding that establishment) is perfect.  My concept is that people whether they come to Westport for dinner or to barhop would play a round of mini-golf and drink a beer or 2.  The mini-golf course would be tasteful/aesthetically pleasing, relaxing.  The beer would be inexpensive with tv's that you could watch the game (so you can sit and drink-don't have to play mini-golf).   
I would be active in the management and not some invisible investor that doesn't care about the upkeep and experience.
I believe in Westport and Kansas City and would be proud to open up this establishment in this community.
This post is my first outreach to get feedback on this project and would like to hear your input.  Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qngc,False,,,True,t3_16dxrx,http://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/16dxrx/new_minigolfdrinks_venture_in_westport/,

For anyone wondering, the closest is in Columbia, MO.

So, I went to the White Castle website and submitted a request for a location to return to Kansas City. A couple of days later, I received the following response:

&gt;Thank you for your recent suggestion directed to our corporate office that we locate a White Castle restaurant in your area.  We appreciate hearing from customers who enjoy our products.  We have noted your suggestion and have forwarded it to our real estate department for consideration; however, at this time we have planned all of our construction for 2013 and are now looking for sites for 2014 and beyond.

&gt;In immediate response to your inquiry, however, White Castle prides itself on growing slowly. White Castle and all its subsidiaries are privately owned and operated. The company does not franchise or offer stock options, and finances its expansion solely through retained earnings. For these reasons, White Castle tends to operate within the existing Midwest and Northeast regions where all our support facilities (meat plants, bakeries, etc.) are located.  We believe in this business practice so we can provide a stable company for the more than 12,000+ employees it supports.

&gt;Due to these factors, as well as advertising efficiencies, we add only approximately ten to fifteen new restaurants every year to our existing market areas along with restaurant remodeling and building replacement as needed.  Based on our current expansion plans, it will be a few years before we open another new market area.   A list of our current locations can be sent to you via conventional mail upon request.

&gt;Thank you again for your interest in White Castle and its products.

&gt;Sincerely,


&gt;Elizabeth Ingram
&gt;COO and President, White Castle System, Inc.

http://no-more-glass.com/letter.pdf

&gt; Dear Mr. Glass –
First, we would like to thank you for purchasing the team in April, 2000, and for keeping the Royals in Kansas City under the direction of the Trust of Mr. Kauffman. This city is grateful for the continued presence of Major League Baseball and for our once‐proud franchise here in Kansas City.

&gt; Unfortunately, that must be where the praise and thanks end. Under your leadership, this organization has gone from one of the best‐run franchises in Major League Baseball to a continued laughingstock and a perennially losing organization that has not played a meaningful September game in the 12 plus years you have owned the team.

&gt; This is an organization that has gone from playing for Division Championships, Pennants and World Championships almost every year for the better part of a 10 to 12 year span, to a team on a proverbial “youth movement” for the better part of 15 years. As this continues, an entire generation of children will not even be able to say that the Royals were once good “back when I was a child,” which is the only thing I can say at this point in time.   An entire generation has been lost during your tenure. Mr. Glass, with all due respect, you have permeated a culture of losing in the Kansas City Royals organization and it cannot be overcome without new ownership.

&gt; I won’t discuss in detail the recent payroll tax fiasco, or the fact that the City of Kansas City wanted to build a downtown baseball stadium for YOUR team and you gave it no thought because of the costs.    I don’t believe for one second that the citizens of this great city would NOT want a new baseball stadium downtown to revitalize the City. I do believe that you would have rather spent $25,000,000 on a renovation instead of $75,000,000 on a new stadium because of your apparently short‐sighted views.
 
&gt; Let’s look at the facts. You purchased the team in April, 2000, for $96,000,000 and (according to Forbes Magazine) the team is now valued at $354,000,000, with a 2011 annual operating income of $28,500,000.    The clause that any sale profits go to charity has expired, so you can simply put $258,000,000 in your pocket if you were to sell. This profit does not even include the profits you have been making year after year during the past 12 years while collecting revenue sharing with a payroll consistently among the lowest in the League. Under your leadership, the Kansas City Royals have had four different 100‐loss seasons (2002, 2004, 2005, 2006) and three additional 95‐plus loss seasons (2001, 2009, 2010), according to www.baseballreference.com. The organization has been through five different full‐time managers, plus two additional interim managers in your 12‐plus years of owning the team. We have also been through two General Managers. 

&gt; Since 2000, the following “similar” cities (those within our same general size and economic viability) have played in the post season:    Chicago (both NL and AL), Detroit, Minnesota, Cleveland, Tampa Bay, Texas (Dallas), Oakland, Seattle, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Houston, Arizona (Phoenix), San Diego, Colorado (Denver).    This year Washington and Pittsburgh look as if they will join this list. The GM’s, Managers, losing seasons, etc. all have one common denominator ‐ and that is you, Mr. Glass. 

&gt; I apologize if this letter seems somewhat disrespectful or harsh, but I refuse to believe that there is not a way to orchestrate your making a $250,000,000 profit by selling the team to a local ownership group with a long‐term view, willing to put money back into the team to revitalize this once‐proud organization in this great city of ours for generations to come. By any measure when accounting for wins and losses, the records will show the fans have rolled up their sleeves, in the only way Kansas Citians know how, and met our commitments to the franchise we love. There is no measure that can support the same sentiment for
your records. It’s time to win again Mr. Glass. I implore you, Mr. Glass, to sell the team immediately, enjoy the rest of your days with your family without the burden of team ownership, and accept our thanks for keeping the team in Kansas City.
 
&gt; Sincerely,    
&gt; Joseph S. Accurso

My wife and I had lunch at [Cafe Gratitude](http://cafegratitudekc.com) on Southwest Blvd today.  While we were inside, my car was towed from the ""honor system"" parking lot to the east.  An unpleasant confrontation with the tow truck operator ensued, as we were one of **five** groups of people whose vehicles had been towed during lunch.  Anyway, that's not the point of my post.

My point is that after I went inside to let the owner/management know that we thought that the way the owner of the lot and the tow truck guy (not convinced they aren't one in the same person, btw) was most likely costing the cafe repeat business, Natalie, the owner, offered to drive us to get my car.  My wife's car was still at work (I had picked her up for lunch) and where she works in closer than the impound lot, so Natalie drove us to my wife's work instead.  

I can't say enough good things about the way I was treated both as a run-of-the-mill customer before all this went down, but most especially after, when I was back inside being a bit of a fly in the ointment.  Offering to drive us around town is way, way above and beyond for a restaurant owner.  To top it off, Natalie seems like a genuinely nice person.  Please, if you can, consider a meal (or two) at Cafe Gratitude.  Don't let this gem die. As for that tow truck guy?  Fuck him.

Initial Question
----------------

We pay for Turbo Pass Internet ($53.95) and Turbo Pass Internet Upgrade ($9.95). I get consistently 8 to 12 Mbps. http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/residential-home/internet/plans.html lists Turbo at up to 20 Mbps, a speed which I never come close to achieving. I don't even know what the Upgrade should do, but for that price at the previously listed site I should be getting up to 30 Mbps. Why is my speed so terrible and what are you prepared to do to fix it?

Donald Smith
&gt; Hello! Thank you for choosing Road Runner Internet Technical Chat Support. 

My name is Donald, I will help you.

Donald Smith
&gt; I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.

Donald Smith
&gt; Please give me a minute while I pull up your account.

Donald Smith
&gt; Are we still connected?

Erin_
&gt; Yes.

Erin_
&gt; You asked me to give you a minute.

Donald Smith
&gt; Yes, Erin. I am sorry.

Donald Smith
&gt; Thank you for time and patience.

Donald Smith
&gt; I checked the status of modem and the connection, every thing is fine. I see that you have Road Runner Turbo Internet plan on your account for the Turbo Internet plan your upload speed is 2 Mbps and the Download speed is 20 Mbps.

Erin_
&gt; 2 things. One: I have Turbo plus Turbo Pass Internet Upgrade, as listed on the bill. What does that do? Two: I don't get anywhere near that speed... ever. Even when using the test directly to TWC.

Donald Smith
&gt; Okay

Donald Smith
&gt; Erin, Turbo plus Turbo Pass internet upgrade is free from Time Warner Cable.

Erin_
&gt; standby for bill photo

Donald Smith
&gt; Normally you have RR Standard Internet plan. TWC had upgrade the services to Turbo plus Turbo Pass with out any charge,.

Erin_
&gt; http://imgur.com/MYZSh9t

Erin_
&gt; Here is what is advertised. http://imgur.com/jvAGHYx

Donald Smith
&gt; Okay. Let me check

Erin_
&gt; So for $54.99 I should be getting up to 20 Mbps, but instead I am paying $10 more to get 12 Mbps on the high side, rarely.

Donald Smith
&gt; Erin. please check the speeds now.

Donald Smith
&gt; Speed Test URL: http://www.timewarnercable.com/KansasCity/learn/hso/speedtest.html 

Erin_
&gt; ms/Mbps/Mbps - 91/14.92/2.14, 93/17/2, 91/10.69,2.16, 91/15.47/2.17

Erin_
&gt; It is slightly improved. First, why is that; what is different? Second, that still doesn't solve that for what I am paying I should be getting this package, http://imgur.com/V8wDBjg, which is up to 30 Mbps.

Donald Smith
&gt; Erin, I had updated the speeds to upload speed is 2 Mbps and the Download speed is 20 Mbps. 

Erin_
&gt; Holy cow. I'm not upset with you, so forgive my frustration. That means that I was set to a level below Turbo at the same time as paying for Turbo plus Turbo Pass Upgrade, or the same price as Extreme.

Erin_
&gt; That means we have been paying $63.90/month for well over a year and were actually set to the package that cost $44.99/month.

Donald Smith
&gt; No, Erin. The Turbo pass is free. For more details about the Internet speeds and price. I will transfer the chat to concern team. They will provide you the complete details.

Erin_
&gt; I sent the picture. It isn't free. I have been paying for it. It is right there on the bill. Forgive me, but what am I missing?

Donald Smith
&gt; Please wait, while the problem is escalated to another analyst

Analyst Silvia has entered room

Analyst has left room

Silvia
&gt; Thank you for contacting Time Warner Cable eCommerce Online Sales Department home of the best TRIPLE PLAY OFFER, my name is Silvia. What services can I help you set up today?

Analyst Donald Smith has left room

Erin_
&gt; I really hope you have access to the transcript, but let me know if you need me to summarize.

Silvia
&gt; Would you please provide your full address, so I will be able to provide the right information

Erin_
&gt; (address)

Silvia
&gt; I can see that you have an issue with your speed correct?

Erin_
&gt; Correct

Silvia
&gt; Just a moment

Silvia
&gt; I am almost done

Silvia
&gt; For security and company purposes, I will need to confirm the Full Name, Phone Number, and the 4 Digit PIN Number please

Erin_
&gt; That last CSR must have really screwed up then. They didn't need it to help me. Weird. (name), (phone), (pin).

Silvia
&gt; Ok perfect in this case I can see that everything is added into the account the Turbo Pass already, are you getting the speed?

Erin_
&gt; I can't understand what that means. Here is the deal. I pay this, http://imgur.com/MYZSh9t, and got speeds about 9-12 Mbps, told it was supposed to be up to 20 Mbps. Last CSR after a while told me to check again, and they were up to 14-15 Mbps. He said he has set them to up to 20 Mbps, meaning it was set below that.

Erin_
&gt; The bs part is I am supposed to, now that he set the correct speed, be getting the speed of this package, http://imgur.com/jvAGHYx, but am paying an extra $10/month for who knows what and actually getting speeds much slower, and as admitted by TWC were actually set slower. In reality I am paying appox. the same per month as this package, http://imgur.com/V8wDBjg, and getting less than half that speed.

Silvia
&gt; I undertsand, would you please double check again? I just send you the signal again.

Erin_
&gt; Check what; the speed? What signal? I'm slightly confused.

Silvia
&gt; The speed.

Erin_
&gt; 93 ms / 14.06 Mbps / 2.21 Mbps

Silvia
&gt; In this case Sr. we are the online sales department and this specific issue we are not able to complete it, this will be directly with Technical support at: 855-880-6192.

Silvia
&gt; Apologize the long wait, and the wrong transfer for the previous representative.

Erin_
&gt; What, I was just sent to you as, ""the concern team"".

Erin_
&gt; Ah ok.

Silvia
&gt; No Sr. we are the Online Sales Department.

Silvia
&gt; Is there anything else I can do for you?

Erin_
&gt; Whoa...

Erin_
&gt; Don't disconnect.

Silvia
&gt; Sure

Erin_
&gt; I have been here for over an hour and expect to, within this session, be connected with an individual who can help.

Silvia
&gt; In this case Mr./Ms (last name) it will be directly with customer service and they will assist you with everything, but it will be directly by phone.

Erin_
&gt; Well, it is most disappointing that it took over an hour to arrive at that conclusion.

Silvia
&gt; Apologize for that Sr. I understand. But it will be directly with them.

Erin_
&gt; And, at which hours can I reach that department at 855-880-6192?

Silvia
&gt; 8 am  - 5 pm

Erin_
&gt; Timezone?

Silvia
&gt; yes your time zone. 8 AM - 5 PM.

Erin_
&gt; Farewell

Silvia
&gt; Once again my name is Silvia, thank you for contacting Time Warner Cable. Have a great day!

There is no way you are poor enough to justify what you do.  You didn't not need a bike.  If you did, you could go the bike collective where I volunteer to build one for free.  You didn't take it out of impulse or desperation.  You came to my apartment with a bolt cutter.  You planned to do this.  You've done it before and will do it again.  You didn't take it because it was valuable.  I bought it for $25 and I doubt you'll get any more than that for it.  You must steal and sell many bikes to support whatever habit you have.  

You stole my bike because you have made a choice to rely on crime over the many other options available to you.  You have decided to ruin this community even further. I have made the choice to use my time to help this community by volunteering at St. James place, the 816 bicycle collective, and the bus stop ministries as well as working for the Boys and Girls club.  But now you've even impaired my ability to do that.

I hope you're pleased that you are poisoning your city.  I hope you suffer in the shit hole you've made.  Don't blame your vices, you chose your vices too.

To all the KC residents reading this, my bike is a 26'' red murray with drop handles, black cable housing, and a Dr. pepper sticker on the frame.  I doubt it'll be found.

It's usually branded either McLaren or Nexis Audio. They'll make it sound like it's an entire system, and it's NOT. If you're lucky, it's a box of speakers and probably not even very good ones.

Would love to have folks in Kansas City sign up to be beta testers.

Although a full version of the site isn't up yet. Here is a sample of one of our KC itineraries.


**10am - Blue Bird Bistro**

Tucked away in the eclectic Westside neighborhood right outside downtown KC is Blue Bird Bistro.  This is one of the few restaurants in KC that truly offers a complete menu of food using fresh locally sourced ingredients.  Start the day there and treat yourself to a surprisingly light eggs benedict with a creamy hollandaise sauce drizzled over organic spinach, onions, and mushrooms that sit atop poached eggs and a lightly crisped english muffin.  Oh, and did I forget the scrumptous crumbles of feta cheese found throughout the plate?  . 

**12pm - City Market (Farmer’s Market)**

After you’ve filled up on all that sweet sweet goodness at Blue Bird Bistro, head over to the City Market just a few minutes drive away north of Downtown in the Columbus Park neighborhood.  The City Market is a large open shopping center with all sorts of shops, but don’t expect finding anything resembling the GAP.  On weekends, the City Market hosts the region’s largest farmer’s market year round where you have your pick of fresh produce from farms throughout the area.  Pick up some fruit, cheese and some wine in preparation for our next stop.
  
But before you leave, take a few minutes to explore the surrounding Columbus Park neighborhood.  Interesting fact of the day, Columbus Park was an early home to a large Italian and later on Vietnamese immigrant population.  There are several gems all across that neighborhood where you can pick up authentic Vietnamese or Italian delicacies.  
 
**2pm - Nelson Atkins Museum**

Head down to the Nelson Atkins Museum and find a spot on the huge open space they have.  Here are some essentials: picnic blanket, champagne, OJ, meat, cheese, crackers and a kite.  Enjoy the beautiful day lounging around drinking mimosas and utilizing all that open space to fly a kite around.   When you get bored, head on into the museum (free) and check out all the great exhibits.  There's always something new being featured.

1320363500.0,29,self.kansascity,lzm7l,It's Official: KCIR is closing (Here's the REAL reason),38,9,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/lzm7l/its_official_kcir_is_closing_heres_the_real_reason/,"(Credit goes to a certain KC lawyer and avid racing fan. This was not written by me.)

""Let me start out by saying that the ""sale"" of the track is not a decision that the owners want to make. They are not sell-outs, nor are they willingly abandoning the racing community. They are as deeply tied to racing, if not more, than anyone here. 

In a nutshell, this was a political move. It may be one person, it may be a combination of people, but there are only 3 major players who have the kind of clout around KC to force the sale of the track.

1. Claire McCaskill. She owns approximately 27 acres (I believe) in the immediate vicinity of the track. My understanding is that she has been unable to market or sell her property for a significant profit because of the proximity of her property to the race track. That might make a good motive to lean on the city to force the track out of operation. And you can't forget councilwoman Circo...who also happens to be a fundraiser for Claire McCaskill. Interesting how that works out, isn't it?

2. Christine Kemper. She owns one of the houses on the hill on the other side of Noland Road, across from the track. The bulk of the track's problems started immediately upon her taking possession of that home. Many of you will recall the huge debacle involving the storage shed that Kemper and Porrevecchio tried to use as leverage to shut down the track. Huge hearing before the BZA. City Hall was packed. While she was successful in costing the track a lot of money in unnecessary ""improvements"" and attorneys' fees and ultimately restricting the days and hours of the track's operation, she could not shut the track down. But don't for a second think she has let it go. 

3. Ms. Ulmer who owns all of the property up on the hill, east of the track. After her husband passed away, she has been trying to develop that property by herself. Rumor has it that nobody is thrilled about assisting in the development of that property because it's right above the track.

Now which one(s) of these people are behind the political pressure to force the sale of the track is anyone's guess. But there is a jerk in the woodpile somewhere.

Next, while what the city may try to claim is that this is a voluntary sale, nothing could be further from the truth. The city had been trying to buy the track for a while, but could never come up with any money. So the track entered into negotiations with another buyer (who would actually keep the track there, but would result in an infusion of cash for the track). After finding out that the current owners had found a buyer that would keep the track where it is, the city sent a letter threatening the condemnation of the land. Guess what that did to the sale of the property.

While under threat of condemnation, the property is dead. You can't sell it. You can't rezone it. And it makes no sense to spend any more money on it, because it may be taken from you at any time. So that's the first dirty trick the city pulled. Just the threat of condemnation crushed any chance the track had of selling to someone who could improve the place and devalued the purchase price to any other interested buyer. 

Then the city, through its codes administration, began really putting the pressure on the owners to ""fix"" certain alleged violations at the track. ""You can't have any electricity in your new outbuilding."" Ok. Then it was, ""You MUST run electricity to the new outbuilding."" Ok. Then it was, ""You have to repave the parking lot near the outbuilding"". Why? That wasn't on the approved plans? ""DO IT!"" Then it was, ""you need illuminated exit signs in the building."" Why? Those weren't on the approved plans and this is a storage shed. It's not a public building as defined by the codes. ""Do it or we'll fine you, etc, etc,""

So the city started making it clear that if the owners didn't sell, at a low ball price which the city could afford, they'd just come out there every single day and find something to ticket them for. Take away their vending permit. Something. The city very clearly sent the message, 'If you don't give us this land, we'll make your life a living hell. And if you make us go through the condemnation process, we'll make sure you are offered pennies on the dollar for the property and that after you've paid your lawyers, you'll walk away with next to nothing.""

Welcome to Kansas City politics. And you thought it was bad during the Cleaver days?

And so far, the city has failed and refused to provide any assistance in finding another location for the racetrack. The owners even agreed to take less money in exchange for help finding a replacement property and some time to operate while they built the new facility. The city was NOT willing to give them another season, or even another day. The city is not paying what the property is worth, but it's paying more for the property just to shut it down NOW and to not have to find a new place. If that gives you any idea of the real motivations behind this move.

So you, the tax payers, while still getting a deal on the property, could have had it even cheaper if the city would have given the owners more time and helped them find a new place. But the city would rather pay more to run a business out of town immediately. Feel free to be pissed aS fuark about that, too.

So the city will have a completely worthless, non-income generating nuisance that it will have to take care of in place of a money earning, property tax paying business.

But hey, at least some of the more powerful women in the city will be able to line their pockets with cash after it's gone. And when it comes down to it, isn't being a politician really about using your power for your own profit?

Those are about all of the details I can provide at this time. I'm waiting for the press release to be issued by the city, to see how they ""spin"" this thing, but what I just told you is pretty dang accurate (other than my speculation about who is behind the string pulling). The city is RUNNING THE TRACK OUT OF TOWN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

The track has been blackmailed, bullied and beaten into selling. HOWEVER, you can still lean on your elected officials to either (a) undo the deal and refuse to fund the purchase; or (b) at a minimum, assist the owners in finding a new location for the track.

Those are the facts as I believe them to be.""",,False,,t5_2qngc,False,,,True,t3_lzm7l,http://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/lzm7l/its_official_kcir_is_closing_heres_the_real_reason/,

They weren't at the Lyric this weekend, though.  No, Helzberg Hall at the new Kauffman Center is open, and it's about time.  I was, frankly, overwhelmed.  I'm a 27-year-old man and a musical veteran of sorts, and I had a hard time keeping it together during their last piece.  If you've seen them before, there is absolutely no comparison between this and last year.  The orchestra is *right there* (and our seats were ""terrible""), the sound is everywhere, and I just... mm.  Wow.

I'm really excited for Kansas City.  This venue will attract the world's best talent to *our* stage.  It really is that good -- we've already had Itzhak Perlman, Placido Domingo, and Emmanuel Ax.  I urge you to go at some point in the future; even if you've seen them before, even if it was ""meh"", you're in for a powerful experience this time around.  Save up if you need to.  It's worth it.

I fully support any kind of mass transit. However, my problem with the current streetcar proposal is that it does not connect anything new. What we need is a way to GET downtown, not a way to get around once I'm there. Kansas Coty is surrounded by suburbs, connect those and you'll get an increase in buisness. Give us a way to get from Johnson County to Westport, connect power and light to the northland.

Going from union station to main street does nothing. We should be focusing on bringing more people into the downtown area, not shuttling around people who are already there. That infrastructure will be built as an effect of the larger transit systems. Kansas City has all of the pieces to become a big city. The problem is getting from one piece to the next.

Imagine coming in from the suburbs for afternoon at the Nelson, shopping in the plaza, dinner in westport and drinks at power and light without ever touching your car.",,False,,t5_2qngc,False,,,True,t3_qax5i,http://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/qax5i/the_problem_with_the_kansas_city_streetcar_plan/,

I saw a lot of trash talk on TWC, but I signed up anyway because you don't need to sign a 2 year agreement and Google Fiber is incoming. 

But my god. This is like some sick joke. First day, since I'm using my own router, I had to call and get them to allow my router access. Which is fine. But their script added something akin to ""ap_void"" at the end of every webpage I tried to go to, and it wouldn't go away. (So if I went to reddit.com, it'd redirect me to reddit.com/ap_void and there'd be nothing there.) I told this to the phone rep, and she basically said, ""Well, the internet works. If your web browser isn't working, contact them to get it fixed."" 

And the horrible service just kept right on going. I've got to cycle my modem/router almost every morning to get online. And what seems like 20 times a day a page won't load, and I'll have to wait for 30-60 seconds and try again. 

Are all these issues due to TWC and my router really not getting along? Or are these guys have a corporation deathwish? 

EDIT: I took cobolNoFun's advice and changed my router's dns settings from TWC's to google's. It's been an hour and I haven't had any issues since, plus all my pages are loading instantly (before there was a 3-5 second lag).

Babyback ribs look amazing, they are $4.95 per pound though - This means 4 servings would run about $35, about half what it would cost in a restaurant for honestly, a very superior product.  
ps if you think Chili's when you think babyback ribs, it makes me sad

[Brisket $15 per pound ](http://i.imgur.com/HGrW0.jpg)  
[Pulled pork $15 per pound](http://i.imgur.com/RCCpr.jpg)  
[Ribs - Market](http://i.imgur.com/ITzPO.jpg). 
I can take orders until about 4 pm Friday; I need time to get the meat and prep it, let it rest in the rub and 15 hours in the smoke. So yeah it's a 30 hour process, give or take. 

Meeting (meating) somewhere around the plaza would be great, Waldo, Westport - let me know and we'll work it out.

Okay, stop by for brisket sandwiches $1 per ounce - you want a small 4oz sammich, $4 - you want a big fatty half pounder, $8. That's about the same as $15 per pound and easy on the maths. Plus you get a bun included and sauce if you like! Noon to 4 Saturday May 11. I regret that I do not anticipate having any pork ready by then, and I'm not shortcutting the goodness.
I am at 79th and Ward Pkwy Plaza - I don't want to put my address online, I'll put out a sign so you can find me if you go to the trouble to drive out.  
Thanks!

My wife and I and daughters age 8 and 3 spent 70 bucks to walk through this place for at most 30 minutes before we were facing the gift shop exit.  (The gift shop by the way was the largest single exhibit in the place.)  

Now I've been to a few aquariums.  My wife is from Philadelphia and we go to the Camden Aquarium every few years and were hoping for something closer to that scale.  Not even close... and the Camden Aquarium is cheaper.  I'm not expecting hippos or even penguins to be found anywhere in Crown Center (exhibit not actually in Crown Center by the way) but this thing was basically a large pet store.  There were some large sting rays and some small sharks but outside of that most of these things could be bought at a well stocked pet store.  

But really my complaint isn't the display or content.  It was just how small and short the thing was.  Literally 30 mins and I'm staring at the exit.  We went back through twice more just to try and squeeze our $70 out of it.  My final thoughts were this is the type of thing I would expect a mall or the Union Station to do for next to nothing if not free just to attract customers to the area.  But it was fun for 20 minutes.  If you've got more money then time then drop as much is it costs for a family of four to go to the ball park or Worlds of Fun and enjoy your lunch break.

You can like us on facebook (https://www.facebook.com/GreatBrewsEveryone) or subscribe to our mailing list (http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/R97DBRZ), if you're into that sort of thing.  

Stuff like this seems trivial, but it's the easiest way for me to prove demand to banks and people with way more money than me.  I swear upon my t-shirt collection that I'll never sell your data or spam you.  

Once I've got the logo finalized, my goal is to provide more regular status updates via social media.  So far everything I've been doing is pretty boring, but I'll have some serious questions I'll need help answering in the future (like your favorite beer, favorite board game, etc).

Thanks again for everyone's support so far.  I'm really looking forward to drinking a great brew and playing awesome games with everyone!

The deposit secures for them six months in which they have to submit a plan to the city, after which the land would be made available to whomever. They put down the deposit a few weeks ago, and neither the city nor any of the businesses in the area have heard anything from them since then. There was a meeting with the city and the area entrepreneurs last week, and that's all anybody seemed to know so far. I'll post any updates I hear as they come in.

The owner of Fox's Drugs said that if the store opens there and it has a pharmacy, he'll most likely sell his business because there's no way he'd be able to compete.

Personally, I have no idea why a grocery store would want that land, given that there are two vacant grocery stores in the area, one at 63rd and Raytown, the other on Blue Ridge Blvd around 51st street.

I'm sure I didn't see the entire exchange, or how it all began, but what I saw was just not right.

There was a man in a large Ford stopped at the light violently pointing at the homeless man, reaching across his passenger seat with his finger extended. 

He started flipping off the homeless man like he just insulted his wife.  Pointing angrily again, then making the slit your throat hand gesture. He continued doing this until his light turned green driving off, flipping the man off over his seat while driving away.  I could feel the hate and disgust from this guy from where I was sitting in my car; there was just so much anger behind it.
  
Through this whole exchange the homeless man looked extremely confused, from what it looked like, at least at first he thought the man was reaching to give him money.

Turns out, upon further digging, that the landlord alone has to pay $300 per unit (24 in my building, he owns many other buildings in this neighborhood...NOT the Knaack slumlord though) and he's not really eager to do that. 

[So here is a list of all of the rental properties that have entered agreements with Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com/help/apartments/list/), just incase anyone was wondering what the status of their building was.  Sadly, only four or five buildings in all of Southmoreland are on this list.  If you notice your building isn't on, give your property owner a call. Beg them. 

[Here is a good link to send them about Google Fiber in apartments.](http://fiber.google.com/help/apartments/) 

&gt;""What you pay...

&gt;When you get Google Fiber, you get it for your whole property. To get Fiber for your property, you must pay a $300 construction fee (plus tax) for each unit in your property. You can pay this fee over 12 months.

&gt;...But you can get all of it back

&gt;When your property is connected to Google Fiber, each of your units can receive Free Internet at today’s average speeds for at least 10 years. But why settle for average? For each unit that upgrades from free Internet to either a Gigabit or Gigabit + TV plan, you will receive a monthly rebate of $25 up to the maximum construction fee (within 10 years).

&gt;That means you can fully recoup your expenses for bringing Fiber to your property if your tenants upgrade to Gigabit or Gigabit + TV.""


I'm mostly frustrated because TW doesn't work in my unit.  They have admitted that my SPECIFIC unit in my building is at the very end of the ""line"", the last unit hooked up, the last unit on the ""line"" (what THEY call it) and my internet will work about 4 days A MONTH. I don't even have it anymore because it was so frustrating. I've heard bad things about AT&amp;T in my building too.  I've been using my phone as a hot spot. Awful.

We have purchased enough burgers and dogs to feed roughly 70 people. From your responses, we have:


* jalapeno poppers and stuffed shrooms

* Cards Against Humanity

* 2 liters of Coke

* hamburger/hotdog buns

* a side dish that is not chips or dessert

* a guest that is not a redditor

* a few pork butts 

* that generator for us to use

* Bear Semen

* beer. Lots o beer

* beer and some sides and/or meats

* cupcakes

* beer.... And.... Cookies? Brownies? Name tags?

* pasta salad of some type

* Mudjadarra



See something missing? Feel free to bring it! If you can't decide what to bring, money would always be appreciated to help cover the cost of food and shelter rental. We changed the time for the grill kick off, it will now start between 1pm and 1:30pm. It seems the majority of people will be showing up around that time but feel free to join earlier or later. We have the shelter until sunset so between 7pm and 9pm.


I went and visited the shelter today, Checked to see if the electricity worked, sadly it did not. Water was flowing from the faucet but the doors to the bathrooms were locked. I took some photos as well which you can view [here](http://imgur.com/a/FEZZW#0). Here is the [PDF](http://www.jacksongov.org/filestorage/4450/1169/1225/LongviewLake.pdf) of Longview Lake Shelters, we are at Shelter #3, I will put a sign up in front of the shelter to help out.


Just off the top of my head, we could use some charcoal, utensils for grilling, an extension cord, plates, napkins, eating utensils, chips, plastic cups (no glass), and if you have any yard games you can bring that would be appreciated. 

Hope to see you all there!

I know that the current owners kind of pushed it to become something it's not, like a dance club.  Also, they tried to have ""Latino Night"" on a weekend night which alienated other clientele (women, mostly, because there was a drag show on those nights and they blocked off the women's restroom as the queens' dressing room) on a high-revenue night.  I give them props for the expansion and decoration improvements, but sometimes I miss the smaller bar where the back room only had one pool table, there was no dance floor, there were crummy couches to sit on, and there was teal everywhere.
