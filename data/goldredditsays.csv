Well, now that the internet's favorite troll has been exposed by Gawker reddit is abuzz with opinions about the situation. When I clicked on [this thread about his appearance on CNN](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/11pka1/violentacrez_on_cnn/) I was expecting tears of free speech from top to bottom but I was pleasantly surprised. Here are some choice quotes that show how much reddit has grown up in the past year:

&gt;[""I love how it's apparently fine for VA to post whatever he wants provided its strictly legal, no matter the intent, however a journalist who follows a newsworthy story is the scum of the earth. Apparently free speech ony applies to people the hive mind likes.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/11pka1/violentacrez_on_cnn/c6oic7d) [+158]

-
&gt;[""""I've made a huge mistake""
No, a huge mistake is forgetting to take the groceries out of your car at night when you bought a bunch of meat and dairy. This was a lifestyle choice that enabled and encouraged the sexual exploitation of minors. I'm glad to see this man burn.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/11pka1/violentacrez_on_cnn/c6ojrq8) [+59]

-
&gt;[""VA posts jailbait pics - FREE SPEECH!
Gawker posts VA's name - VIOLATION OF PRIVACY!
Fuck you, reddit.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/11pka1/violentacrez_on_cnn/c6ojllh) [+43]

&gt;[""I vehemently disagree with Reddit’s response to Chen’s outing of VA. Yes, I understand that there are potentially dangerous ramifications to posting a user’s personal information online. But at the same time, a user can host an AMA with instructions on how to successfully rape a woman, or how to dispose of a body, and this is accepted (if not encouraged) Reddit behavior. This also has dangerous ramifications.
Reddit, as a business, often hides behind the argument that it cannot be held responsible for its user generated content. If that’s the case, as long as the content is legal, Reddit shouldn’t be in the business of drawing distinctions as to what’s permissible to post (e.g. AMA on rape) and what’s impermissible (personally identifiable information).
The cynic inside me thinks the real reason behind the policy of no outings is because it’s bad for business. Rape, murder, (and for a long time jailbait) is acceptable because it generates traffic and pageviews (hell VA even got an award for this). But public outings? Well that may discourage people from posting, and that’ll be bad for business.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/11pka1/violentacrez_on_cnn/c6oimcm) [+20]

&gt;...a ""nice guy"" isn't usually actually being nice. He pretends to befriend a girl, does nice things for her, and expects sex in return.

When the woman doesn't vend the sex the ""nice guy"" thinks he's earned through favors, he gets angry and bitter (like when you start smacking the vending machine to get your chips to fall down). At no point does he treat the woman like a friend or even like a human, but rather like a vagina that he has earned without ever telling her he was earning his way to sex through what she thought was an honest friendship. ""Treat like shit"" usually means 'didn't want to have sex with when he felt entitled to sex.' [+17]

Bit of backstory: The football player in question is Steve Gleason, a former Saint, current ALS activist, and all-around good guy. The radio shock jocks were from Atlanta, home of the Falcons, the Saints' biggest rivals. The rivalry is something fierce and involves tons of trash-talking, personal insults, and occasional fights. Last year, some Atlanta airport employees egged the Saints bus. Online, insults and slurs are pretty common.

That's why it was so heartwarming to see Falcons fans standing up to say, hey, it's really shitty to make fun of people for being sick or having a disability. 

From a Falcons fan [+197]:

&gt; [Unacceptable. That doesn't reflect the thoughts of Falcons fans at all. 790 is trying to get publicity by being a ""shock jock"". They are way behind the other local station, 680, in every category including ratings, and it looks like they are trying anything to get noticed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1giquc/790_the_zone_in_atlanta_just_did_an_incredibly/cakl7z2)

Falcons fan [+139]:

&gt; [I'll say FuCK the Saints until the day I die, but this is unacceptable.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1giquc/790_the_zone_in_atlanta_just_did_an_incredibly/cakm0ox)

Saints fan response [+158]:

Vikings fan is reasonable, too [+31]:

&gt; [No, they should lose their job.
They have shown an inability to determine which subjects are off-limits and which ones are fair game. I, for one, would not be comfortable with them on the radio anymore. I couldn't trust that they wouldn't do something as monumentally stupid as this again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1giquc/790_the_zone_in_atlanta_just_did_an_incredibly/cakrblk)

Bucs fan is pleasantly surprised [+112]:

&gt; [Much respect to both Falcons and Saints fans for being civil in here. This is a big reason why I love /r/nfl.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1giquc/790_the_zone_in_atlanta_just_did_an_incredibly/caklvye)

As an added bonus, comments trying to claim oppression of free speech have been downvoted into oblivion. 

I know this might not be a typical submission, but as a huge Saints fan, it felt really important and awesome that Falcons fans were so respectful about it.

&gt;[+168/-33]

.

&gt;Some pieces of advice are good, but the guy's sexist and a bigot. The world isn't divided by women and men - treating people well shows you're principled and rational.
The worst thing you can do when you're old is believe you have everything right and pander that advice off to others. I'm wrong, what I'm saying can be completely wrong for you, but if you follow this guy's advice, you're going to die hostile and alone. [+83/-24]

.
&gt;as a girl... ಠ_ಠ 

&gt; that guy is sexist as fuck. [+37/-17]

.
&gt;This advice comes from a state of anger and loneliness, most likely brought about by living a life misguided by this sort of thinking. You follow advice like this, believing that the world and other people are terrible, it leaves you alone and angry at the world. Then having made yourself alone and angry, you believe being angry and lonely is truly the right way to feel because it's how you ended up.

&gt;Not smoking is always good advice though. 14 is alright as well I think, a lot of people are constantly afraid of everything going wrong that they don't take the time to enjoy the great lives they already have, or the fruits of their labours. [+36/-10]

.
&gt;Meh. #5, #10, &amp; #14 are okay. The rest sound merely subjective &amp; overgeneralized if I'm being nice and sound like misogynist &amp; racist (nips? really?) bullshit coming from a cynical guy who's been burned once or twice if I'm being truthful.[+18/-2]

I haven't been on SRS lately in a while, so maybe I've just averted my eyes, but I think the site's getting better with things like this. I honestly expected half of the comments to devolve into some sort of weird fetishy, rapey, climb-over-each-other-edginess contest.

Jesus christ I'm still in shock. People were for the most part so respectful. 

The top comment wasn't racist or sexist.

&gt;Well, it's an interesting cliche to pull out in this context, isn't it?
Compelling us to treat comparisons of female strangers with masturbatory devices as a joke, then joking that it is rape is normal.

&gt;I'm British, so doubly fuck you. If all you see in that photo is a ""realdoll"" (that is to say, a walking masturbatory device), then that is the most pure objectification of a woman there is. I know you didn't say it initially but it wasn't a 'joke' that was worth defending.
But it's only a joke and according to you it must in the British nature to be shit to women. I didn't call you out because I expected better of a Brit or anything...

&gt; This guy sounds like a fucking asshole. Any sign of physical disability and you need to bail? If you are already dating/seeing this woman, then it is probably nothing significant because you didn't notice it at first when you were attracted to her. Of course when both of you end up in bed and her taking off her prosthetic leg would result in a completely different issue.

&gt; Same here. I've had major depression for about 9-10 years. Just because I have it doesn't mean I cannot manage it and expect everyone else to deal with it. [+18]
...

&gt; Jesus Christ, this guy is a piece of shit. I can't even finish it. [+13]

...

&gt; If my dad gave me advice like this, I would be ashamed at his narrow-mindedness. [+8]

...

&gt; I want to knock this poor bastards skull in for his own sake. Idiots who can't love someone for love don't deserve to live. It's about friendship and honesty. Not lies and judging people by their pasts or disabilities. [+9]

...

&gt; Sure am glad my father taught me how to deal with life's messes rather than cynically avoid em. Life's messy, no matter how much you try to avoid bad moments in a relationship with any woman, they still will happen. Learn to deal not to run. [+5]

...

&gt; Can anyone give me TL;DR? [+3]

I've been thinking a while that the rules for this subreddit aren't well defined. I originaly created the subreddit simply as a way to catch all those good things we see Redditors saying out in the wilds of Reddit (note: GRS wasn't my idea, it was another SRSer's great idea,) I never really thought about the rules, r even if there should be any rules.

As it stands now, we only have one concrete rule:

* Please include the post count in brackets along with a quote as the title of the gold you are submitting.

So, I put it to you, the gold miners of GRS, what rules should we have? Only upvoted posts? Downvoted posts are acceptable? Only quotes? Allow some generalization or summary in titles? Fuck the rules we'll do it live?

I reserve the right to make the final decision, but I'd like to you your input as well!

Edit: Also, if there is anyone out there good with subredit design, CSS and whatever and you'd like to take a shot at blinging GRS out to the max extreme, please feel free to speak up. I'm bad with such things and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the valuable feedback everyone! There are some great points made here, so coming up with a list of rules is going to be far easier than I thought. I'll make up a list of rules, and then make a new self post soon(ish.)

Suggestions and comments always welcome!,20,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/goldredditsays/comments/uvklw/goldredditsays_new_community_guidelines_are_here/,"Hello gold miners! I consider our discussion on what our new community guidelines should be a rousing success! [Here is the link to that thread for those interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/goldredditsays/comments/ur2nu/i_want_you_to_join_the_discussion_on_what_grs/)

[For fun, you can listen to our theme song while reading this post!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q9VcX6cNtU)

Rule I: Posts that are bigoted, creepy, misogynistic, transphobic, unsettling, racist, homophobic, or just reeking of unexamined, toxic privilege will probably result in a ban.

* Notes: This is standard across all Fempire subreddits and will remain as a rule of prime importance here. We want GRS to be free from the usual bad stuff that's standard on the rest of Reddit. Only golden comments should be found on GoldRedditSays!

Rule II: Please include the post count in brackets along with a quote as the title of the gold you are submitting. A brief summary for context or for complex posts is also acceptable.

* Notes: This rule is so we can easily see the gold that a miner has found and allows for some flexibility if it's needed.

Rule III: Please link to an individual post and refrain from liking to an entire submission. Please do not say ""this whole thread,"" and instead find a good nugget of gold that you liked to link to from the comments.

* Notes: Reddit can be very variable and there's no guarantee that a thread filled with gold today will still see that gold at the top tomorrow. By picking out your favourite nugget of gold it adds a little more permanence.

Rule IV: Please link only to upvoted posts. We want to see people agreeing with gold, to show that there are decent people on Reddit, and upvotes are a great indicator of that.

* Notes: This one is a bit controversial, and I appreciate both sides of the argument why we should or shouldn't include downvoted posts. Actually, I'm still not entirely sure if we should include downvoted posts, maybe we need a vote on this one? [EDIT: A poll has been added here, upvote your desired choice, feel free to debate the pros and cons as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/goldredditsays/comments/uvklw/goldredditsays_new_community_guidelines_are_here/c4yxqua) This rule has been altered to disallow downvoted posts.

Rule V: Feel free to upvote the gold!

* Notes: This isn't SRS, we don't have to worry about touching poop in here. Upvoting is a nice way to show encouragement and our appreciation of gold found in the wild on Reddit. Coupled with Rule IV means we can maybe mitigate the hive-mind tendency to punish dissenting opinions, which was one reason I went the way I did in deciding the fate of Rule IV (though Rule IV could still change.)

Rule VI: Please do not link to a comment by an SRSer, a cursory glance at someone's posting history to see if they post in any Fempire subreddits is all it should take to determine this. Excellent posts by SRSers should go in /r/SRSGreatestHits. Note that this includes no links to Fempire subreddits.

* Notes: SRSers post gold all the time, this subreddit would be very active if we included such posts, but that defeats the purpose of this subreddit, which is to chronicle gold posted by Redditors in the wild.

Rule VII: Please do not link to threads you have some involvement in.

* Notes: This is in the interests of fairness and neutrality, and so we aren't tempted to use GRS as a way to score personal points or settle personal vendettas.

I think this is everything, if anyone has think I may have missed something, feel free to speak up. These rules aren't set in stone, so any feedback or suggestions are totally welcome.

Thanks for all the input and happy mining!

My basic moderating style is to let anyone do whatever they want because I should be doing my homework (please don't P-Dub me,) so I have little time on Reddit.

I'll let the other moderators do whatever they want. We'll probably try to enforce basic ""SRS Rules"" because those seem to work well I think.

We are definitely under the domain of the Great and Powerful Fempire, but I consider us to be more independent and loosely  affiliated, more like a grand duchy or somethings, to put it into European sociopolitical terms.

Reddit responds with ""They should call this the Pity The Retard award"". There's an SRS thread on it, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/tcbpu/referring_to_young_girl_with_cerebral_palsy/).

Well one of the lesser known responses to that bullshit lie buried in downvotes. It's long but SOOOOO GOOOOLDEN:

&gt;We don't know about the girl in the OP. She may very well be popular or for some other reason have been awarded this.
We can't assume it was given to her for being disabled.
And people with cerebral palsy aren't mentally deficient. In fact, I'm pretty fucking embarrassed when I go out with the CFO of the company I work for and people talk to him like he's an idiot because he looks different. The fact is, he's a very good person with a PhD and again, is the CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER of a multi million dollar company. He's also married and has kids. He could have been prom king on his own merit. When people like you talk about him being a retard, I question your intelligence.
I teach disabled young adults and there is one very low IQ young woman who is the most disciplined, beautiful and funny girl I know. She's very popular, not just with the kids in my program (most of whom are genius IQ, by the way), but with her neurotypical peers.
I think making the assumption that she couldn't be popular and worthy of prom queen just because she's disabled is as bad as giving her a title because she's disabled.
I pity the 366 ""retards"" who upvoted your comment.
Edit: Downvoted for going against the circlejerk. People simply cannot believe this girl may actually be popular. [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/tbzt6/a_girl_with_cerebral_palsy_won_prom_queen_at_my/c4lerss).
