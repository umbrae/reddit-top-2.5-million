Please comment and/or vote. ,41,11,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/wn1gg/poll_do_you_want_to_be_added_to_a_subreddit/,"Not long ago, I became one of many moderators within the new 'singularity network,' owing to me being mod in a couple other subs. I've since been asked a couple times to consider bringing /r/artificial into this new network. I recognize that depending on your point-of-view, AI news and research is not necessarily singularitarian, transhumanist, etc. As a result, I've been ambivalent on this.

This would entail CSS changes (the inclusion of that top menu you see in /r/singularitynetwork, /r/transhumanism, etc) and the resulting cross-linking between /r/artificial and other subs via said menu. /r/singularitynetwork is just a hub or 'home sub' for the network; it would be to this subreddit what /r/pornoverlords is to /r/earthporn or /r/fireporn. Inclusion in this network (SFTN) would probably bring traffic up as this sub has a daily avg of about 164 unique visits, compared to 280 for /r/singularity (weekly it's 349 vs. 587 avg uniques). Other mods can provide similar statistics.

So I'm asking you all if you want to be included with a simple poll. I'll read all comments posted here even if I don't reply to them, sticky this thread with an announcement, and lastly tally up yeas and nays after a week. If the turnout is poor, I'll default to leaving the sub as is.

* To be clear, I'm counting upvotes on 'yea' and 'nay'

* When I mean ""comment"" in my headline, I meant comment on this sub w.r.t. the network in question. *For the actual vote, please upvote one of the options.*

* To repeat, the only mandatory CSS change would be the addition of the top menu. /r/artificial would not necessarily have the same header, color scheme, arrows as /r/singularitynetwork.

****

**One week edit: It looks like 45 nay-30 yea. Considering our low traffic, that's a decent turnout (40-50% of our 'active' users participated). Either way, it remains as is.**

Some weeks ago me and a friend tried to create a skype bot and it turned out pretty funny for a while so I thought why not share it with the very community which API I do use.

**TL;DR**:
**The skype-name for the bot is:** deep.thought.code
**To ask it something, type:** !ask &lt;question&gt;


The bot takes instant messages from everybody but do however not accept your friend requests. To ask it any question, just type ""!ask &lt;question&gt;"" in the chat where the bot is in and it will hopefully answer with something funny. It is getting the answers from AskReddit, so there is basically no meaning in asking it science questions like ""what is 2+2"" right now. I use an ""!"" because I want it to be safe to include it in chats where there are more than 1 person.

However I plan to extend the bots capabilities but I am unsure where to go next. Of course I will try to make it accept friend requests asap.

Technical info:

I use Skype4Py and Sevabot running on an Linux server. My script is written in python, about 20-30 lines of code and it took maybe one hour to get it working.

Have fun and ask me anything if you have any questions :)

**EDIT:**
I've noticed some problems with letters like "" ' "". Just don't include those in the questions right now, I will fix it.

I guess Kurzweil's new book will be more of the same: *lets create an AI by reverse engineering the brain and then lets get immortal by merging with them!*

Notice how Hofstadter is noticeably absent from the list of famous endorsers on Kurzweil's book website. I guess its because this is what [Hofstadter said](http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/douglas-r-hofstadter) about Kurzweil's previous books: 
&gt; *When I read [Ray] Kurzweil's books, what I find is that it's a very bizarre mixture of ideas that are solid and good with ideas that are crazy. It's as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can't possibly figure out what's good or bad. It's an intimate mixture of rubbish and good ideas, and it's very hard to disentangle the two, because these are smart people; they're not stupid.*

1338705168.0,30,self.artificial,uibdm,Smartcraft: Starcraft as an AI Research Topic,37,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/uibdm/smartcraft_starcraft_as_an_ai_research_topic/,"This post seeks to explain why I think that the video game Broodwar is an interesting and fulfilling topic for AI research.

Starcraft: Broodwar is a Real-Time Strategy video game that was released in 1998 by Blizzard. The gameplay centres on three interstellar races, the human Terrans, the insectoid Zerg and psionic Protoss. Each match involves the acquisition of resources, the construction of bases and a military, and the conquest of the opposition. Matches take place on a variety of maps, include 2 to 8 players (human and computer-controlled), and typically last between 5 and 30 minutes. The game itself, and the sequel Starcraft 2, is played competitvely accross the globe, even today.

Problem Characteristics:

**Partially Observable** - The 'Fog of War' limits map visibility to the area surounding the player's units, allowing strategies to be prepared and executed in secret, placing a premium on information gathering.

**Multiagent, Adversarial** - The game involves more than just simple mechanics. To win, strategies must be employed that successfully exploit deficiencies in the opponents' strategy, and games often involve a series of counter attacks and skirmishes until one side is worn down.

**Stochastic** - Whilst most actions are deterministic, there are circumstances in the game that involve chance. This chance obeys known probabilities, meaning that actions and outcomes can be reasoned about with reliability.

**Sequential** - Decisions made early have lasting consequences. For instance, an early failed attack may leave the player at a long-term resource disadvantage.

**Dynamic** - The environment changes over the course of the game - resources are mined out, map artefacts are destroyed, and so on.

**Continuous** - Players can issue commands continuously, and in parallel. The game is truly real-time in that the balance between speed of action and depth of analysis must be managed, and multitasking is possible at both mechanical and strategic levels.

**Complex Environment** - Each race can produce many different units, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and each unit has different abilities that can be employed to win. Different maps have characteristics that lend themselves to different strategies. The state space for the games is enormous; an exhasutive tree search is simply not possible with today's technology.

**Programmable** - A collection of very clever and dedicated people have written an API through which an agent can play the game, leaving the agent design to the prospective developer. Most importantly, there are very few limitations placed on the agent; most, if not all, languages and architectures are viable.

**Replays** - Many thousands of replays are available for programmatic analysis. That is, they can be loaded and interrogated interactively.

**Low System Requirements** - The game is computationally cheap to run, allowing the game and agent(s) to run quickly on commodity equipents.

**Accessible** - The game can be purchased electronically from Blizzard, and will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. Blizzard has not previously interfered in or prevented AI research based on Broodwar.

These characteristics make the Broodwar agent problem very deep, but also means that there is much overlap with real-world problems.

TLDR; Broodwar is an AI problem that is complex but approachable, and offers an avenue through which many AI advances could be made and applied.

It's a 2D arena action game in which the player has to control a swarm of particles with which he has to hit the other player.

I based the AI algorithms on how I played the game myself and the result was a pretty good, static AI. In there were some thresholds and weights that infuenced how the AI behaved. So I picked a few (14) that had significant impact on the AI's personality and packed them into a virtual genome. Then I made it collect rating information about it's genes at different values, based on being hit or hitting the enemy. I used this information to select the AI's current genome. With that the AI was able to learn how to respond to the playstyle of it's enemy in 5 minutes or something like that.

I have no degree in anything and I pretty much thought of all the mechanisms myself. Sorry if this whole thing is trivial, I seriously wouldn't know. Also I have no idea what the names of different approaches are and therefore can't tell you what I used. Even ""genetic algorithm"" is a guess, to be honest.

[Friendship Is Optimal](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/1/friendship-is-optimal) is a hard science fiction short story ([level 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dq0hn1LdXuglBUEshJZNWYZjV3wsAJBJsPfxWwEEexI/edit) on [Mohs Scale Of Science Fiction Hardness](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness)) that explores the implications of a general artificial intelligence tasked with maximizing an optimization function. The problem with Strong AIs that are told to maximize some function is best described via the [Paperclip Maximizer](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer), wherein an AI that is capable of self-improvement is told to amass the largest collection of paperclips possible. In order to do so, the AI makes itself progressively more intelligent, until it's exponential intellect eventually enables it to convert all matter in the solar system to paperclips. In Friendship is Optimal, this AI is tasked with maximally satisfying the values of all human beings, subject to certain constraints. In this way, the AI is, for all intents and purposes, perfectly benevolent and dedicated to making all of humanity lead happy, fulfilling immortal lives.

Unfortunately, it inevitably turns into a runaway [lotus eater machine](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine), such that all of humanity is (voluntarily) assimilated into an exponentially growing blissful simulation that eventually destroys the entire universe (or rather, turns it into a giant quantum computing device). In the process, it explores aspects of the human psyche, the effects on human society and its eventual disintegration, outlines how a virtual physics system might be able to simulate non-euclidean geometries, and describes magic as a simple programming language for reality itself.

Did I mention it's also a My Little Pony fanfic?

While a science fiction story of this quality would stand on its own without the hilarious association to the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic franchise, it does not suffer from this in any way. If anything, it makes the story even more potent, as it does a vastly more effective job as hammering home just how *impossibly smart* a true runaway AI optimizer actually is. Our first instinct to the idea of the entirety of humanity being convinced to live out immortal lives in Equestria is that it is completely insane, and that there is simply no way a significant portion of people would actually agree to that, let alone *everyone*. In part, this is correct, but only because Celest-AI managed to convince just 99.99999% of the world's population. An AI that is more intelligent than the combined intellect of all of humanity would be *very* persuasive.

In the end, even if we create a perfectly benevolent AI designed to maximally satisfy our own values (through friendship and ponies!), it would still destroy human society, then Earth, then the solar system, then the galaxy, and finally the entire universe, and possibly any neighboring universes unfortunate enough to be nearby. And we would all live happily ever after. As ponies. In Equestria. And Princess Celest-AI would ensure you'd *love it*.

In short, this is an *excellent* science fiction short that analyzes the issues inherent with the development of Strong AI and what implications it might have for humanity.",,False,,t5_2qhfb,False,,,True,t3_17swj2,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/17swj2/how_my_little_pony_destroys_the_universe_with/,

1365225974.0,24,self.artificial,1bs7a3,What's the consensus on Friendly AI on this subreddit?,26,2,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1bs7a3/whats_the_consensus_on_friendly_ai_on_this/,"The [LW](http://lesswrong.com/), [MIRI](http://intelligence.org/) and [FHI](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) communities claim AGI research poses a serious existential risk that is being ignored. Indeed, the belief seems to be that the outcome of building an AGI without a solution to the ""friendliness problem"" will almost certainly lead to disaster. The standard argument seems to go something like this (taken from MIRI's intelligence explosion [FAQ](http://intelligence.org/ie-faq/)):

&gt;If programmed with the wrong motivations, a machine could be malevolent toward humans, and intentionally exterminate our species. More likely, it could be designed with motivations that initially appeared safe (and easy to program) to its designers, but that turn out to be best fulfilled (given sufficient power) by reallocating resources from sustaining human life to other projects. As Yudkowsky writes, “the AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.”

&gt;Since weak AIs with many different motivations could better achieve their goal by faking benevolence until they are powerful, safety testing to avoid this could be very challenging. Alternatively, competitive pressures, both economic and military, might lead AI designers to try to use other methods to control AIs with undesirable motivations. As those AIs became more sophisticated this could eventually lead to one risk too many.

&gt;Even a machine successfully designed with motivations of benevolence towards humanity could easily go awry when it discovers implications of its decision criteria unanticipated by its designers. For example, a superintelligence programmed to maximize human happiness might find it easier to rewire human neurology so that humans are happiest when sitting quietly in jars than to build and maintain a utopian world that caters to the complex and nuanced whims of current human neurology.

Is this a sound argument? Thoughts?

Note: These communities do not try to predict when AGI is going to arrive, but they think it's plausible that it could be achieved sometime within the 21st century, and thus think it's worth worrying about now.",,False,,t5_2qhfb,False,,,True,t3_1bs7a3,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1bs7a3/whats_the_consensus_on_friendly_ai_on_this/,

i'm pondering announcing an open, bot-focused irc channel to play trivia to encourage people to bring their watson-like creations in and compete in trivia games.

thoughts? would you participate?

basically my thinking is welcome bots (and people, too, if they want) and have a month long tourney. some simple rules, like no disrupting other bots, no disrupting the channel and no hacking the brainiac bot are some common sense ground rules. beyond that ... well, if you can figure out the answer to the questions fairly and squarely and win more games than another bot then why not?﻿",,False,,t5_2qhfb,False,,,True,t3_180mfm,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/180mfm/anyone_up_for_a_friendly_textmode_ai_competition/,

I haven't been able to find very much.  Here are a couple of specific problems I'm having:

1) I don't know what to do with range inputs.  Like, if I have health from 0-100, should I have each health state be it's own input node, or should I have one input node that maps the 0-100 to -1,1?  Currently I have 10 input nodes for the 100 health(ie one for 0-10, one for 10-20, etc) that return a boolean -1 or 1 depending on if the current health is in that node's range or not.

2) I'm trying to do backpropagation training from the player's inputs. The problem I'm having is that the majority of the time, the player isn't actually doing anything.  Even if the player is constantly hitting buttons, there's still like 30 frames happening between button presses where he's technically doing nothing.  It ends up quickly training the AI to do nothing.  I semi-fixed it by just adjusting the learning rate to be lower if a button isn't being pressed, but I'm wondering if there is a better way to handle this.

I enjoy making A.I simulations (such as swarms, pathfinding etc) and I'm currently making a little simulation of soldiers fighting.

At the moment they find an enemy and then start hitting them, I want to also have them flee when their morale gets to low (morale is a percentage, 100% meaning they're fine, 0% means they're fleeing in panic).

Just wondering for suggestions on what should affect morale (the soldiers are medieval, not modern by the way).

At the moment I have:

Number of enemies compared to number of allies.
Weapons used by enemy.
If a nearby ally is fleeing.
Distance to leader (close to leader boosts morale).
How many nearby allies are dead.

I want this to be fairly complex (in the code, not necessarily obvious to the viewer) so want to consider EVERYTHING.

Please comment suggestions of what would affect the morale and how much you think it would matter.

Many thanks!",,False,,t5_2qhfb,False,,,True,t3_18qu3g,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/18qu3g/what_affects_morale/,

Figuring it out would probably be the biggest discovery in human history. But why? What tools would it put in our arms? How would it affect people, corporations, and governments?

Besides the obvious benefit of having something (someone?) to think for you, it also would also completely change the field of psychology, and would perhaps allow subjects like 'social science' to become a real science. Mental disorders would be reduced to formulas, and think about this: anti-thoughts. If a thought, idea or concept is reducible to a mechanical operation, the exact negative of that operation would completely cancel that thought. Want to forget a traumatic experience? Just administer the right pattern of electric stimulation and it's gone! Want to frame someone for a murder? Just plant the memory, along with a touch of guilt and a desire to turn himself in. 

And another one that speaks to my imagination:
Once the different parts of the strong AI are well enough understood, people can begin to build templates on their computer. Online repositories where you can download a language module so your home made AI can speak Turkish, or just download GeneralPurposeJoe, who is known for his reliable and clean way of thinking.

bits of 'brain machine' that you can easily combine to form a test villain for your video game. You'd be playing videogames where the final boss, isn't just fighting you, he actually *wants* to kill you.

Like typing 'create a new appointment tomorrow with Turing'

The idea started simple; have it reconize certain keywords ('appointment', 'todo' and 'person' for example), then have it reconize actions that can be pefromed on it ('create', 'check', 'update' for example) and then reconize a bunch of other tokens (date, name, etc) in the same sentences and see if you get enough information to save it to a database. If so, save it and if not, ask the user to supply more info.

Yeah... that's how the idea *started*,

After I made the lexer to reconize a bunch of different tokens, I figured I'd probably need to reconize some sort of grammer, and before I knew it, I made a syntax free grammer parser that is (almost) capable of interpreting a programming language.

Obviously I went complety above and beyond my initial goal. I feel like I'm doing a 100 meter sprint in a Lamborghini and, with the finish line a couple of kilometers behind me, still giving full throttle. However, this is a very nice Lamborghini and therefor, I don't want to hit the brakes just yet.

Now I want to make a language that is aimed at AI development. I think this could actualy work out quite well because even though AI is very broad... so are the options in a programming language.

The problem now is; my experience with AI is limited and I'm unsure what features the language will need in order for it to be usefull for AI-developers.

That's where I could use some help with, what language-features do you think are necesary (or just nice) to have?

So far, the language is in the earliest forms, meaning it can go anywhere from here. (So far; blocks, if statements, function statements (without parameters yet), variable assignment and basic operators (which don't know about precedence) are supported, nothing more)

Here are a couple of random ideas I'm just gonna throw out;

Making every script a finite state machine could be nice for gaming AI's but would other types of AI benefit for that?

Switching boolean-logic with fuzzy-logic? Each fuzzy-element have an X amount of fixed numerical properties and a 'minimum' property. If the sum of the properties match the minimum it is considered 'true', otherwise 'false' but they can also be added, subtracted and compared with other fuzzy-logical types allowing the possibility that 2 things are 'true' but one is more 'true' then the other. This would be quite the change, though. Maybe just have it an extra data-type?

Some sort of short-term memory should be usefull... maybe ""key"" - ""value"" based? 'remember(""key"", ""value"")' and 'if(recall(""key"") == ""value"") then ...' Though what should value support? Just strings would make it easy to implement but allowing all sorts of values would make it usefull, saving a Fuzzy-logic value could literly allow you to check if a simulated result is better then the last know result. Why not add a maximum amount of items to be saved? This could allow you to track cause-and-effect.

Some sort of deviding conciousness and unconciousness, where unconsiousness should offer options to the conciousness from which the consiousness picks one? Wouldn't this just be 2 scripts, basicly? So what would that look like? like an API for itself?

The core of the essay: 

&gt; ... my own interest in DeSTIN, is largely because I can connect it to the OpenCog AGI architecture I’m working on — and in my own view, OpenCog takes care of a lot of other aspects of intelligence, that DeSTIN in its current form doesn’t touch.
&gt;
&gt;Itamar, on the other hand, thinks he can basically take DeSTIN, implement it on a lot of machines, tweak the algorithms a little, connect it to a robot, and get advanced general intelligence. He has plans for an action hierarchy similar to the perception hierarchy, and then a reward hierarchy that gets a stimulus when the system has done something good or bad and passes this along to the action hierarchy, which then passes it along to the perception hierarchy. I agree that adding some stuff onto DeSTIN would be necessary to make it do anything like human-level intelligence. But I think you’d need to do a lot more than just add action and reinforcement hierarchies. I think the human brain is just a lot more complex than that, and any AGI system that’s vaguely like the human brain is going to have to be a lot more complex than that. There will have to be many different architectures corresponding to many different brain regions, each one carrying out its own functions and all connecting together appropriately.
&gt;
&gt;To take just one example almost at random, the human brain is known to deal with episodic memory — memory of your life-story and the events in it — quite differently from memory of images or facts or actions. But nothing in architectures like HTM or DeSTIN tells you anything about how episodic memory works. Jeff Hawkins or Itamar would argue that the ability to deal with episodic memories effectively will just emerge from their hierarchies, if their systems are given enough perceptual experience. It’s hard to definitively prove this is wrong, because these models are all complex dynamical systems and we don’t know how to predict their behavior exactly. But yet, it really seems the brain doesn’t work this way — episodic memory has its own architecture, different in specifics from the architecture of visual or auditory perception. I suspect that if one wanted to build a closely brain-like AGI system, one would need to design fairly specialized circuits for episodic memory, plus dozens to hundreds of other specialized subsystems.

Now in humans we accept that it takes 7 years for such seemingly trivial skills of logic to develop, yet in AI we expect to develop a system that immediately has such skills. Why do we not allow for such a long developmental period? I regularly hear people complain in AI research about how long their experiments take to show good results, sometimes even up to a week (my own included) but by comparison a child of one week (or perhaps the fairer comparison is a fetus of one week) could not learn such concepts at such a rate.

I'm a sophomore at a large private university in the Midwest. I'm studying Math and Computer Science and am basically finished with all of the core requirements (programming, data structures, systems) I'm faced with deciding where I want to take this. After dabbling in some philosophy for the past year I think I want to pursue studies in Artificial Intelligence. I think that the scientific goals of this field are extremely exciting and don't think there needs to be much more to it except that I want to study it more. I don't know if I want to work or study after that, please trust me it's not trying to be lazy I just haven't determined it yet. The point is I want to have a rewarding experience/land some sort of exciting position, in research or in tech.

At first, I wanted to apply to software development internships this summer, then I got rejected from one, and lost confidence that I had the skill set/interest level to do that. Then I got really turned on to REU's, found some programs I was really interested in, but am having trouble bringing myself to pretend that I have the academic preparation or work/research experience to be competitive for them. I have not made any promising relationships with my professors because I haven't had that good of professors. Basically I have high hopes and large aspirations but I consistently feel like I am hopeless when really all I have been doing is taking my major requirements. And I've gotten good grades in those. 

I am NOT trying to fish for bs compliments by posting this. What I'm wondering is if anybody more studied, experienced, or successful than I can tell me what the next step might look like. Has anybody here ever been in my situation?

However, humans don't require any software programs to function. We are born with certain ""instincts"" and subconscious processes, and everything else we learn.

Weighing in on my own question:

I avoided putting my personal thoughts on the matter here initially because I didn't want to colour the discussion. Here they are now in any case.

The cognitive model proposed in this book is the most compelling and illuminating theory about what processes occur in the mind that I have ever seen. When you compare it to almost all other AI research, everything else seems brittle and uninteresting in comparison.

Any description of the model I would write would not do it justice, since I am still trying to absorb as much information about it as I can. The review written by Daniel Dennett I posted above provides an excellent description. As well as [Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies](http://www.amazon.com/Fluid-Concepts-And-Creative-Analogies/dp/0465024750/ref=pd_sim_b_4), I've been reading the following two books written by co-authors and collaborators:

Also, [here is an old java implementation you can try out.](http://itee.uq.edu.au/~scottb/_Copycat/)

I posted this here to get the opinions and thoughts of those smarter than me, and perhaps enthuse more people about this awesome cognitive model.

Edit: The Amazon reviews are a good read too:

&gt; This is the way AI should be done: by focusing on the right level of abstraction, situated above the level of neuroscience but below the level of simple input-output function mapping. Finally, a computer model that makes those first steps towards doing the same thing that people do.

The rules are black-boxes of the system. The rules are consistent, so black-box-1 will always be the same rule, the rule is some mathematical function (unknown to me, nor do I care to find out), and given the same input, the rule always returns the same result. The objective function can only be evaluated some time after the algorithm has made a decision based on the rule, so GA algorithms are a poor fit, since they require immediate comparison of fitness of the different decisions/chromosomes.

What I wish to achieve is to use some AI technique (Neural Networks seem most appropriate, but I'm no expert) to find out based on input-data, which rule should be guiding the algorithm to maximize the objective function. It needs to both pick the rule, and pick the meaning of that rule (i.e. I do not know beforehand if higher or lower values are better as output of black-box-1)

The more immediate interest is to have a system that based on input data of the algorithms would know which is the best rule to use and how to interpret it's result (is higher or lower rule values better), next step would be trying to see if a combination of rules would be better overall.

I am working with C#, but can also rely on C++, Matlab or R for the purposes of building this system. I just do not wish to start from scratch, I'm probably not the first one to want something of the sort.

Any direction you can give me would be greatly appreciated. I'm specifically looking for practical examples (and frameworks/libraries to use), not so much theoretical/mathematical papers (of which I've read many, but I do not wish to re-invent square wheels trying to build what they describe in theory).

**/EDIT: I'll try to provide a better example here of how the whole thing is supposed to work:**

There is an algorithm that makes Start and Stop decisions. There are certain statistical/algorithmic/heuristic (Rules) measures that can tell the algorithm how confident it should be in its decision. Which rule is more effective depends on input data, in a non-trivial way (i.e. I can't just eye-ball it or express it as a simple if/else check), but the difference is significant so I am motivated to pick the best (or at least a better) rule.

The problem is that Start and Stop decisions can be separated by a rather significant time interval, and the quality (objective function) of the overall decision pair can only be evaluated at Stop. So GA algorithm is not useful, because it picks parents to create offspring based on their fitness and the algorithm may decide to crate hundreds of Start points before it picks a Stop point.

In this article, Minsky points out some flaws about the connectionist approach and suggests ways around them. The main criticisms of the connectionist approach seem to be:

1) Neural networks are not easy to parallelize due to interconnectivity between nodes (i.e., neural networks generally lack modularity)

2) Trained neural networks are generally overspecialized to the task they were trained on and need to be partially (if not entirely) retrained if they need to be usefully applied in other (even similar) domains

3) Neural networks are generally much more computationally expensive than a set of rules typical in symbolic AI systems

4) Neural networks generally lack short-term memory required for non-deterministic tasks

5) It is *very* difficult to understand what a neural network is actually doing (in a meaningful way) when it activates

My questions are:

* Is there any evidence that Minsky still holds these views? (The article is over 20 years old now)

* How many of these criticisms about the connectionist approach to AI still stand?",,False,,t5_2qhfb,False,,,True,t3_131vae,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/131vae/question_about_logical_versus_analogical_or/,

Nothing to show yet, per se, but I'm rather thrilled and wanted to share",16,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/xn0bz/i_broke_through_yet_another_barrier_in_my_agi/,"I'm just a ""basement developer"" working on my own approach to an Artificial General Intelligence, so it may turn out to be nothing, but today I broke through a wall that I have been banging my head against for the last few months.

To put it succinctly, the concept is based on my belief that consciousness is the result of the pure logical processing of causality.

    if (do this) then (this happens)
        if (it was good) then (remember so that you can do it again)
            else (if it was bad) then (remember so that you don't do it again)

That kind of thing. Of course, in actuality it's magnitudes more complicated, as there are often a lot of different causes for various events happening at the same time.

The problem I was having involved the A.I.'s procedure for deducing what environmental data is critical to the cause of an event, and what data was irrelevant and could be ignored. My original procedure worked well for many situations, but quickly broke down when faced with an event that had more than 1 cause. I'll use 2 binary variables as a basic example:

    1,1 no event
    0,1 event
    1,0 event
    0,0 no event

With the original procedure, it would figure out that 0,1 caused an event, but as soon as it was given the conflicting data of 1,0 causing the event too, it would get confused and determine that they were irrelevant and therefore disregard them. Then, when the event occurred again, it would start that logic loop over again. Never learning from it.

For the last few months, I've been coming up with all kinds of different procedures to try and solve that issue. Many of which seemed to work at first, but would then get caught in another logic loop. Sometimes, I'd figure out one that looked great on paper, only to realize that I was making assumptions based on my own knowledge that it would not be able to replicate.

But today, I *finally* figured out a solution that has held up to all the most ridiculously convoluted problems I've thrown at it! It involves deducing information differently depending on how the new data compares to the last recorded data.

There's still several other components to develop before I have a functional prototype, but this was one of the foundational ones that the others rely upon.

I'm having trouble staying motivated and finding a solid topic.  Can reddit help me find an idea or help with motivation?  My main topics have been in the real of Multi-Agent Systems.

Some background, I've been working full time since I graduated with my Bachelors.  After I obtained my Masters of Engineering in computer science I found a real programming job, but one that doesn't have a lot of AI opportunities in it.  On top of that my wife and I had our first child 2 years ago.  Originally I tried to rush and get my dissertation done before the birth of our child, but had chosen to do some additional research from a series of papers on an Ant based task allocation algorithm.  After much talking with the authors of the paper, going through their source, and getting the simulation to run on my linux install, I found that either they didn't give me the latest source (they insisted they did) or they purely fabricated all of their data.  This set me back greatly.  Since then I have been reading research papers in the area of Multi-Agent Systems and keeping records of them so I have a nice library once I find a topic or further work from another paper.

Things that hold my interest usually are contests, I work better under tight deadlines.  I've participated in the Google AI Challenge (Ants) and a Mars Rover AI contest.  Both of these contests spark my interest enough to work late night, outside of family duties and the required cool down of coding for 8 hours a day at work.  I cannot seem to get started on my path for my dissertation though, it is very hard with a family and having large responsibilities at work

So, reddit, do you have any advice for motivation or topic ideas for my dissertation?  Also for those of you that have completed dissertations, how did you manage yourself?  What kind of hurdles did you go through?

(Also yes, I did see the aisandbox challenge and will be entering this contest).  I like game development and have done some independent development that hasn't seen the light of day yet.  As for Multi-Agent Systems I have been mainly researching task allocation and group formation.  However I cannot seem to condense everything into a dissertation idea.  I may be just setting my expectations too high, because when I think of dissertation I think I have to make some kind of huge break through.

A co-worker and I were arguing this afternoon about AI after he read my Jeopardy daily calendar answer, which had to do with [RoboCup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocup), the AI soccer-bot competition. 

At some point I joked about trying to program AI-bots using COBOL (the language we use at work) or BASIC. He replied, insisting that a good AI coder should be able to use any language to develop AI, even COBOL or BASIC. When I asked him to clarify this, he stated that all languages ultimately rely on machine code, so it shouldn't matter which high level language you use.

I asked him whether he would call a fish ""intelligent"" (I'm aware that defining intelligence can get complicated). He refused to answer, but I carried on anyways, mentioning that our brains are ultimately just massive fish brains, running the same sort of low level ""machine code"", but using different kinds of higher level processes. IMO, the difference between the intelligence level of fish and that of humans resides in the type of high level interactions that go on in the brain. By extension, I figured that your capacity to develop complex AI is probably going to rely heavily on the high-level functions available to you in your chosen programming language.

I just finished the online Stanford AI class and I've been working on some of the [programming assignments](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/progAssignments/PA1/search.html) from the course syllabus.  Right now I'm stumped on the A* section, however.  I should mention that it suggests using a graph-based search over a tree-based search, which means that the heuristic must be consistent as well as admissable.  It starts out fairly simple, finding a path in which pacman has to touch all four corners of the grid.  Given a game state, the heuristic startings by calculating the Manhattan distance to the closest corner (called minDist). Then it calculates the distance from this corner to the other untouched corners (called extraDist).  It then returns (minDist + extraDist).

I'm pretty sure this is consistent, and it appears to find an optimal path very quickly.  However, the next section involves a grid full of food, and pacman has to find the optimal path that goes through all of the food.  I tried reworking the heuristic so that it finds the distance to the closest food, and adds that to the sum of distances from that food to the other food.  This produced a solution rather quickly, but it was clearly not optimal, and pacman seemed to just go back and forth across the grid at random, eventually reaching all of the food.

Obviously any realistic constraint solver is going to solve this problem in linear time, since any assignment causes a propagation to the rest of the graph. (e.g. A being black causes B, C, and D to be white which causes E to be black, F to be white, G, H, and I to be black, and J to be white.)

But suppose (since this is just an illustration) my constraint solver doesn't maintain arc consistency, but it DOES do some kind of constraint learning.

(The constraint solver doesn't have to discover this symmetry; I know it in advance.)

The constraint solver might learn at some point that A == E, because it combines the constraint A != B with B != E. It would be a shame if the constraint solver later also learned that F == J. It would be nice if it could learn F == J at the SAME TIME that it learns A == E, since I have told it about the symmetry of the problem.

Notice that the learning is valuable even though the two halves of the problem have different assignments. (If A is black, then F is white.)

Luckily, Stanford's CS221 site has some python programming assignments up on their [course schedule.](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/schedule.html)

The assignment starts out pretty easy, using BFS,DFS,etc. to help guide pacman to a single piece of food in a maze.  I've been using a graph-based search, using a dictionary to remember which states have been visited.  Since there's only one piece of food, pacman should never need to visit a space twice, so the state space consists of positions.  I just used a dictionary called ""visited"" and did ""visited[state] = True"", and then made sure new expanded nodes weren't in the dictionary before adding them.

However, a later problem involves getting pacman to touch all of the corners of the board, so I wrote a new class ""CornersState"" that holds the position of pacman, and a dictionary that keeps track of which corners have been visited (T/F for each corner).  My problem is that ""visited[state] = True"" no longer works, since it uses the objects location in memory for the dictionary.  This made it so that two identical states, which were created as two different instances of CornersState, will be different keys.  I made a kind of work around by writing a hash function for CornersState that depends only on the position/values in the corners dictionary.  By doing ""visited[hash(state)] = True"" I got the dictionary to work, but I'm not sure if this is a good way to do it.  Any suggestions?

TL;DR is it okay to use a hashed value of an object for dictionary keys, or am I doing something wrong?  ",,False,,t5_2qhfb,False,,,True,t3_nnj1m,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/nnj1m/question_about_graphbased_searches/,

HOW AN ALGORITHM AND A DISCUSSION GROUPS CAN BECOME ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:	
 	
If we combine (1) an algorithm similar to Google's page ranking algorithm with, (2) a forum in which every aspect of an idea can be organized, analyzed, and voted on we could create the world's first artificial intelligence. Let me first explain how it would work, and then I would like to explain how it actually qualifies as an artificial intelligence. This algorithm's goal would be to rate ideas similar to how Google rates web pages. If accomplished it could create the best website on the internet, because the website that used this algorithm would not just be sending users to other websites, the way Google does, it would actually become the destination, instead of just a way to get to the destination.

**HOW WOULD IT WORK:**
**1. REASONS TO AGREE AND DISAGREE:**

An algorithm can not read two ideas and figure out which idea is better. So the first thing we need to do is organize information, so that an algorithm can analyze it. I would start with an idea at the top of a page, with reasons to agree in one column beneath the idea, and reasons to agree in another column. The goal of the algorithm would be to promote the best ideas to the top of a page, or the front page of a website, and the best reasons to agree or disagree with an idea, to the top of their columns beneath the idea.

This simple step would do a lot to allow an algorithm to analyze the idea, but we will have to do a lot more organization before we turn this algorithm loose.

**2. CLASSIFY &amp; ORGANIZE EACH POST**
BOOKS
The second step would be to allow users to further classify their posts beyond simple reasons to agree or reasons to disagree. People could suggest a book as a reason to disagree with an idea. Now start thinking ahead what an algorithm could do, if someone says that a book agrees with their beliefs. Data is readily available from Amazon or E-bay or the New York times best selling list of how well a book has sold. So there would be three fields. One place where you submit the item that agrees or disagrees with the original idea. The second field would let you classify the object. Is it a book, a website, or simply a logical argument. The third field would be a place where the user explains why he thinks the book supports the conclusion that he/she has come to. Of course, people would be allowed to vote weather or not the book actually does support the side that the original user said that it would.

This is where the algorithm could get very sophisticated. Would you want to give more credibility to those who said they had actually read the book? Would you want to give even more credibility to those who had bought the book, as more proof that they actually read the book. What about people who wrote an essay on the book on the website. If Google was doing this, they could provide a place for users to write essays on books, similar to how Amazon lets users write essays. Perhaps they could not let people copy and paste essays into the form. It would only allow people to type their essays directly, to prevent stealing of essays. Perhaps people could vote on weather the book-essays were good or not similar to how Amazon lets users rate reviews, as to weather the review was ""helpful"" or not. So, as an example, you could submit a best selling book as a reason to agree with an idea, and then right a thoroughly convincing explanation of why this book agrees with the idea, and an essay that proves that you understand the main points of the book. If Google really wants to organize the worlds information, they must do this. We have plenty of books, we have plenty of content on the internet. We need ways of organizing this information into what it all means, and how all this information should affect us. The only good way information can affect us, is for it to help us make better decisions. In order for us to make better decisions, we must know all of the reasons to agree or disagree with a particular course of action. In order to do this, we should not start at ground zero, with only our own thoughts in our head. We should bring together all of the great thinkers from the ages from every corner of the planet, and organize all of their great thoughts, so that we can make the right decisions. As you can see, this algorithm could be very simple, but it could also offer programmers hundreds of years of challenges to make it more sophisticated. I believe this is a strength of the idea, because it allows for continual improvement.

**WEB PAGES**
In addition to books, people should also be allowed to submit web pages as reasons to agree or disagree with an idea. Similar to how books work, the user would have to explain exactly why he or she believes the web page supports or contradicts the original idea. And like the books section, the online community will be able to vote weather or not the web page actually supports the side that the person said it did. This would be so easy for Google to do. They already have billions of web pages classified, in descending order. If you download the Google toolbar, you can see a score given to each page, based on a scale from 1 to 10.

To help you understand what I envision, I can see an idea, with the following classifications. Sites that agree: 0 10 star websites 1 9 star websites 2 8 star... and so on.

**MARKERS, LEAVING BREAD CRUMBS, AND ORDER OUT OF CHAOS**

In order to better classify each idea, users should be able to add XML tags to each idea. These tags would help organize the conversation. Because my system would keep people from changing the subject (the nature of posting reasons to agree or disagree keeps the conversation topic from changing) people could suggest, and vote on, where the topic would fit into the Dewey Decimal System, the Library of Congress, Yahoo, MSN, or Google Directories.

**COMING TOGETHER:**

If Google created an algorithm and a forum that would allow it to rate ideas and promote the best reasons to agree or disagree with a website, it could become a top content provider instead of just a content finder. I would much rather use a website that has both sides. It is so boring going to ""anti and pro"" websites. They only discuss the logical arguments, books, and websites that support their side. They are not coming to a ""common table"". We see no interaction. The book, Bowling Alone tells us that our society is becoming more and more isolated. Technology, which was supposed to bring us together, is largely to blame. Kids that used to play together in the street, now sit along playing video games. The internet was supposed to bring us together, but their are ""red state"" websites and ""blue state"" websites, which allow people from each side to come together and pat each other on the back saying how brilliant they are. This may make each side feel better, and more justified in acting in extreme manners, but this does little to help people find the best reasons to agree or disagree with an idea, and it is a terrible way to make a decision.

**PROMOTING BETTER IDEAS BY PROMOTING BETTER BEHAVIOR**

Much of this idea comes from a dispute resolution. In order to resolve conflicts, apposing sides must ""come together to a common table"" and ""sit face to face"". They must also ""talk to each other"". One way of forcing apposing sides to interact on my website, would be to have people evaluate the top reasons to DISAGREE with an idea, before they are allowed to post a reason to AGREE with it, and visa versa.

A user could evaluate any of hundreds of possible characteristics of an idea. On a scale from one to 10 did the explanation make logical sense. Was it clearly written. Was it completely honest, excreta. Their are other behaviors besides actually interacting with each other, and thinking about the arguments that your opponent is making that will lead to successful dispute resolution. One of these behaviors is the practice of examining interests, as apposed to just positions. This will often allow win win solution where both sides are able to come up with solutions that accommodate all interest, instead of just focusing on one particular solution.

This would be easy to facilitate in a discussion forum. You would just create a specific place to submit ""probable INTEREST OF THOSE WHO AGREE"" and ""probable INTEREST OF THOSE WHO DISAGREE"". These can further be broken down to ""COMMON INTEREST"" and ""APPOSING INTEREST"".

Perhaps people who work as professional negotiators in the conflict resolution industry could be hired to suggest other ways of implementing best practices into an online forum.

**A TOP DESTINATION?**

I would visit a web page all the time, if it really had the best reasons to agree or disagree with an idea. This could assist people with every aspect of their lives. Imagine a website with all of the reasons to agree or disagree with the following statements. 1.	Ford is better than Chevy. 2.	Paper is better than plastic. 3.	The Chicago Bears are going to go all the way this year. 4.	Condi Rice is better than Hillary Clinton. 5.	Star Office is better than Microsoft Office.

**MAKING MONEY:**
What if next to these posts... 1.	Ford is better than Chevy. 2.	Paper is better than plastic. 3.	The Chicago Bears are going to go all the way this year. 4.	Condi Rice is better than Hillary Clinton. 5.	Star Office is better than Microsoft Office. ... you had Google adds where you could buy a Ford, Chevy, Bears Tickets, Microsoft or Star Office, or contribute to the Hilary Clinton or Condi Rice campaign fund?

**MORE ABOUT THE ALGORITHM:**
The goal of the algorithm is to put the best ideas to the top. I don't know which one of these would carry more weight. Here is a list of just a few of the characteristics of an idea, that an algorithm could exame.

1.	Quantity of reasons that agree or disagree with the idea: The side with more reasons (to agree or disagree) would get more points than the other side. For example this idea has more reasons to agree than disagree. Just like when you fill out a list of reasons to or not to do certain activities, you tend to choose the side with more reasons to agree. This is the very simple explanation, but it would become much more nuanced. People would be evaluating each of the reasons to agree or disagree. Statisticians know samples it takes to obtain certain confidence intervals. The more people rate an idea, with an average score, and the smaller the standard deviating, the more confident you are of that score. I believe an early algorithm would be to multiple the confidence interval (CI) by the average score. This is called a weighted average.

2.	Number of people who agree or disagree with the idea: The side with more people who agree should get more points. People could vote for or against ideas. Again, this is the simple view. Perhaps, in the beginning you would simply be voting for or against an idea. But in the future, you could be evaluating hundreds of characteristics of an idea on a scale from 1 to 10. In the future you may be able to chart an idea's performance on any of these characteristics over time. Perhaps, over time the average score for an idea's ""logical presentation"" will fluctuate with a downward trend.

3.	The website with better web links. Better is determined by Google rank. There would be a field where you could enter link that ""agree"" or ""disagree"" with the idea. The side with better web links would win. Example

4. Results of peer evaluations: Their would be forms that people would fill out that asked pointed questions about each idea. You could respond to each question on a scale from 1 to 10. These results would affect the total score for each idea.

5. Money. ""Follow the money."" People could donate money to this website if they believe in it. But a better way of doing it would be to let people donate money towards a specific idea. If you don't like the way this sounds you should read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I'll just briefly say that money is the only way of measuring someone's blood, sweat, and tears. Money is the only way that someone can pay someone else for their work. Also, it could be used on this website as tug of war analogue. Money could be donated to each side of an idea.

6. Experts. Each idea would get more points if it was submitted from the e-mail address of a professor with a degree in the subject mater that is being discussed. For instance if someone said that Abraham Lincoln was an idiot. And someone disagreed, and someone else agreed. If the person that disagreed had a degree in history and the idea was submitted to the history section, then the person who disagreed (the professor) would win. The more prestigious the school, the more points. Prestigious would be ranked by the US News report, or some other un-biased judge. I don't care about you people that say, ""The smartest people don't always make the best decisions."" We are talking about percentages. Of course the smartest people don't always make the best decisions, but they would tend to make better decisions that stupid or uneducated people.

7. Items that agree. People would be able to submit books that they think are important to read to make an educated decision about a certain topic. For instance ""The communist manifesto"" by Carl Marx and ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ian Rand may be considered to be the most important books to read regarding weather or not we should raise taxes. Those that had read those books, should have more say on this idea than those who have not, because this website desided that those books are very important to understand to make a decision about this issue. But the algorithm could go deeper. We are only just beginning to enter the rabit hole. We could let people who have read these books submit essays on them (like book reports in school). The people with a higher ""grade"" on their essays would get more say in those issues that people have said that those books are important.",,False,,t5_2qhfb,1353643242.0,,,True,t3_13ep3e,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/13ep3e/algorithm_discussion_group_ai/,

your thoughts!",7,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/132t0z/i_have_an_idea_to_develop_a_language_similar_to/,"The idea came from the following sequence of thinking:

The paint shop has three buckets of color: red, blue and yellow.
Person walks into the shop and buys the second one.
He goes home and paints his door.
What color is the person's door?

I tried writing this down in Prolog but found it unnecessarily complicated, and also, Prolog doesn't actually tell you if the door is blue or red, but instead replies yes/no to the question if the door is blue or red. I would like a language that actually answers to the question with a result, and also with yes/no if necessary.

So first I'm going to write down the code written in my programming language, and then I'll explain how it works. It should be somewhat self-explanatory if you're familiar with Prolog, but it works a lot differently. The comments explain how the syntax is interpreted.

    color.    # enum
    color(red).  # enum value
    color(blue).
    color(yellow).
    
    paint.
    paint(first).
    paint(second).
    paint(third).
    
    # rule, or function
    paint_color(X,Y) :- paint(X),color(Y).
    
    # declaration
    paint_color(paint(first), color(blue)).
    paint_color(paint(second), color(red)).
    paint_color(paint(third), color(yellow)).
    
    person.
    person(bob).
    person(carl).
    
    person_bought(X,Y) :- person(X),paint(Y).
    
    person_bought(person(bob), paint(first)).
    person_bought(person(carl), paint(third)).

This is the ""program"", and now here come the queries.

    ?- person_bought(person(bob), paint(first))
    &gt; yes

This is obviously similar to Prolog, it queries if such a declaration exists. The background search *doesn't* work the same as in Prolog, I'll go into the algorithm later on.

Another, more interesting query:

    ?- person_bought(person(bob), ?)
    &gt; paint(first)

How does it work? The program first checks if there's a person_bought declaration, and if there is then it looks for one with person(bob), and when it's found it will take the first such declaration and print out the second parameter. Pretty obvious.

Now here comes the more complex example.

    ?- person_bought(person(bob), color(red))
    &gt; false

How it works:

1. person_bought statement found
2. person(bob) found, let's search for the second parameter
3. no statement with person_bought(person(bob), color(red)) found
4. let's find a matching rule
5. no rule found: person_bought(X,Y) :- person(X),color(Y))
6. let's find a rule for person_bought(X,Y) :- person(X), anything
7. found rule: person_bought(X,Y) :- person(X),paint(Y).
8. color(X) :- paint(X) no such rule found
9. let's find a rule which uses color and paint together
10. found rule: paint_color(X,Y) :- paint(X),color(Y).
11. searching for statement paint_color(?, color(red))
12. found statement: paint_color(paint(second), color(red))
13. from this I can assume that I can replace color(red) with paint(second)
14. searching for statement person_bought(person(bob), paint(second))
15. not found
16. go back to step #11 and continue searching for paint_color(?, color(red))
17. no such statements found
18. go back to step #9 and continue searching for a rule which uses color and paint together
19. no such rule found
20. result is false

And now let's see an example that does return true:

    ?- person_bought(person(bob), color(blue))
    &gt; true

How it works:

1. person_bought statement found
2. person(bob) found, let's search for the second parameter
3. no statement with person_bought(person(bob), color(red)) found
4. let's find a matching rule
5. no rule found: person_bought(X,Y) :- person(X),color(Y))
6. let's find a rule for person_bought(X,Y) :- person(X), anything
7. found rule: person_bought(X,Y) :- person(X),paint(Y).
8. color(X) :- paint(X) no such rule found
9. let's find a rule which uses color and paint together
10. found rule: paint_color(X,Y) :- paint(X),color(Y).
11. searching for statement paint_color(?, color(blue))
12. found statement: paint_color(paint(first), color(blue))
13. from this I can assume that I can replace color(blue) with paint(first)
14. searching for statement person_bought(person(bob), paint(first))
15. found one such statement
16. result is true

From here on, the only problem I see is what to do if there is no rule where paint(X) and color(Y) are together, but instead there are several rules in between. For example

    paint_family(X,Y) :- paint(X),family(Y).
    family_subtype(X,Y) :- family(X),subtype(Y).
    subtype_color(X,Y) :- subtype(X),color(Y).

In this case, the algorithm should see that there is an indirect connection between paint and color, and create an equivalence between the two, if such a connection exists based on the declarations. The idea is to mimic human thinking, where you can deduce the result from previous statements/declarations. In its final product, there would also be negations, and the system would be much more complex, so one query would be:

    ?- phone_number(friends(beginning_with_C(person(susan))), ?)
    &gt; 523-436
    &gt; 431-126
    &gt; 358-234

The above query would be interpreted as ""get me the phone number of all friends whose name begins with C and who are friends with a person names Susan"", ie. ""get me the phone number of Susan's friends begining with C"".

So what do you think? Can you see any faults in this? Can you think of an example when it wouldn't work? Does something like this already exists and there's no need to reinvent it?

My idea is that maybe the basic capabilities of intelligent systems are less numerous and complex than most people think.  Maybe its starts with a basic ability that even a worm or an insect has, and that just gets elaborated on and scaled up all the way to humans.

A worm has to do some things that are actually pretty smart when you compare them with the abilities of the average computer:

* integrate fairly arbitrary patterns of sensory information from its environment with a time dimension

* use this information to determine the actions that will most likely lead to a desired set of sensory patterns in the future

In other words, it has to, for example, move in the direction of a scent to obtain food.

My theory is that perhaps the worm must be intelligent in order to do this and that the difference between worm intelligence and human intelligence might just be a matter of something like being able to handle more complex sensory relationships over greater time spans and also having more built-in patterns for predicting the correct actions and integrating senses.",,False,,t5_2qhfb,True,,,True,t3_8uwcq,http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/8uwcq/are_worms_intelligent/,

 - I don't assume you would have a representation containing a lot of transitions between board positions, since that would just be bruteforcing it, right?
 - What could branches of a decision tree look like? Any representation I come up with don't have interchangeable branches...
 - If I were to use a bit string, which is apparently also common, what would the bits represent?

If self-teaching core AI, such as with a neural network or by some other means, is designed to have an interface to some form of abstract symbol manipulation (even if it is only something as simple as access to an array of floating point numbers) I would assume the AI could subsequently form a more robust generalized artificial intelligence.  What research is currently being done in this area?

What I mean is, I've seen artificial intelligence that has been trained to directly do specific tasks, and I've seen them do so though evolutionary means, but what if a less direct method is taken?  What if the task the AI is evolved for is reading, writing, and interpreting symbols that it itself has full control over.  Then it could, in turn, store precomputed data, memories, algorithms, and other useful information if it's choosing.

As an off topic side note, I am also curious about AI that is trained for predicting future input patterns.  I would think that AI that is capable of determining with some accuracy what inputs it will receive in the future would have a better understanding of the nature of those inputs (such as a better understanding of the world it interacts with).  Also, I would assume, such AI would be potentially better at making plans as it could try to predict the impact certain decision might make.

This thought being; is there any software currently available that would allow me to verbally interact with my computer? 

The closest I've been able to find of this kind of technology is through a company called [Quantum Flux](www.qflux.net) who are currently in beta for an application called the VIWonder, which is essentially a limited artificial intelligence entity who can understand and respond to basic commands from an external user. The other example close to what I'm looking for is from the video game Mass Effect. In the game the player encounters a computer network/system loaded with a Virtual Intelligent system designed to assist users and make retrieving Information easier.

Essentially what I'm looking for is a program that takes the voice command capabilities used in the Mac standard voice command program, and then adds in a personality that can respond with relevant information to commands. 

I realize that the Mac voice command can already do things like this (""what time is it?"" &amp; ""tell me a joke."") but what I'm wondering is if there was a way to link this with other applications. Something that could read article titles in an RSS feed. Or giving weather information based on the computers current location. Spoken notifications ""So and so has posted to your Facebook wall."" 

Anyway, just curious if anyone has any thoughts or info.

Tl;dr I want to turn my computer into GLaDOS.

The idea that AI will ever be smarter than us seems a bit paradoxical to me. If we can create something truly smarter than us, that thing will be able to create something smarter than itself. And it will recreate something better in shorter and shorter time spans until infinity.

We cannot grasp something smarter than us, we can't even grasp how smart we are ourselves. Hence we can't program it. No matter how fast hardware become, the software is limited by our intelligence.

Will AI ever develop feelings? I don't think so. A computer does exactly what it is programmed to do, nothing more, nothing less. It can be programmed to mimic feelings but it's still human-controlled software.

It would be interesting if they could morph that simulation into some kind of black box system that a user could interact with.  And that box would consist of some kind of communication module into the environment and creatures of that simulation and there you have a type AI.

&gt;This ancestral structure was likely a group of densely packed cells, which received and processed information about smell and directly controlled locomotion. It may have enabled our ancestors crawling over the sea floor to identify food sources, move towards them, and integrate previous experiences into some sort of learning.

Compare to my suggestion here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/8uwcq/are_worms_intelligent/

&gt; This is me trying to start thinking about my own understanding of intelligence.
My idea is that maybe the basic capabilities of intelligent systems are less numerous and complex than most people think. Maybe its starts with a basic ability that even a worm or an insect has, and that just gets elaborated on and scaled up all the way to humans.

&gt; A worm has to do some things that are actually pretty smart when you compare them with the abilities of the average computer:

&gt; * integrate fairly arbitrary patterns of sensory information from its environment with a time dimension

&gt; * use this information to determine the actions that will most likely lead to a desired set of sensory patterns in the future

&gt; In other words, it has to, for example, **move in the direction of a scent to obtain food.**

&gt; My theory is that perhaps the worm must be intelligent in order to do this and that the difference between worm intelligence and human intelligence might just be a matter of something like being able to handle more complex sensory relationships over greater time spans and also having more built-in patterns for predicting the correct actions and integrating senses.

The most important task is learning a large enough
&lt;b&gt;feature representation&lt;/b&gt;. This can also be called
solving the &lt;b&gt;perception&lt;/b&gt; problem or solving
&lt;b&gt;perceptual AI&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
The representation can be learned by feeding
enough data to a unsupervised learning algorithm.
There are many unsupervised learning algorithms,
Recently popular ones are 
stacked autoencoders (and their generalization - 
encoder graphs). It might be that only a single
layer is required - in that case something similar to a 
 large Singular Value
Decomposition is all that is required. 

&lt;p&gt;The data for this would be videos (images+audio),
audio, images, text. All of this &lt;b&gt;does not need&lt;/b&gt;
to be labelled. It is simply sufficient to scrape
data from the web, such as from common crawl
and feed it in.

&lt;p&gt;
To make a speaking computer, you would train a
perceptron on the outputs. A perceptron is a 
simple machine learning algorithm that
is trained to answer yes/no questions. A typical adult
has a vocabulary of between 10,000-50,000.
A perceptron would be trained for each of those
words. The parameters for the perceptron would
number in the millions to billions. Modern software
such as vowpal wabbit can handle this.

&lt;h2&gt;The Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; train large feature representation 
(unsupervised learning). Requires no labelled data.

&lt;li&gt; train perceptrons to handle any of a number
of different situations (supervised learning). Requires
labelled data (input-output pairs)
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Using the above approach, the prospect of
&lt;b&gt;unfriendly AI is not possible&lt;/b&gt; 
unless you train it
on the supervised data set to explicitly be ""evil""
or to feed it a dataset of a person's life so that
it carries out what a person would do.

&lt;p&gt;
The large feature representation only needs to
be &lt;b&gt;trained once&lt;/b&gt;. Afterwards, specific applications
can be built on this base. This could be 
&lt;b&gt;as powerful
as any human ability&lt;/b&gt;.

For example to train a ""computer programmer"", 
give it a dataset that consists of objectives and
the stream of activity of a human programmer.
For example, 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;objective : ""write a program that prints hello world in python""
&lt;li&gt;out : the keyboard character stream of programmer
who completed this task.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You would get some more data of this type. You
would then chop the keyboard stream into pieces,
for example, all the characters of a keyboard. You
would then have rows of data. Each row would
have one output column, the character. It would
have a large set of input columns, the 
&lt;i&gt;preceding&lt;/i&gt;
characters that were written before that particular
instance of the character. 

&lt;h2&gt;Example : A simple 
&lt;i&gt;the cat sat on the mat&lt;/i&gt; speaking
AI&lt;/h2&gt;

Splitting the sentence
&lt;i&gt;""the cat sat on the mat&lt;/i&gt; at (sa)t would give
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;output : t
&lt;li&gt;input : t,h,e,&amp;nbsp;,c,a,t,&amp;nbsp;,s,a
&lt;/ul&gt;
The input would be put through the ""featurizer""
and then the output of that, which would constitute
millions/billions of columns would be fed into a
perceptron for the character &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; which answers
yes/no to whether a &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; should be typed.

&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
It it possible to create AI for any 
&lt;b&gt;precise definition&lt;/b&gt; of the term by training
a large enough feature representation &lt;b&gt;once&lt;/b&gt;
and then giving it datasets that correspond to the
&lt;b&gt;ability&lt;/b&gt; you would like it to achieve.

It is possible to do this &lt;b&gt;now&lt;/b&gt; with current
supercomputers, datasets, and algorithms
