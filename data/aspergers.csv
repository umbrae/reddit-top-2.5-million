First of all, I want to thank about 90% of you (heh).  It's such a wonderful feeling to be so supported by so many people who don't even know me. I wish I was better at explaning my feelings, but I want you all to know that I am so grateful for all of these helpful and insightful responses. I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
To the small amount of you that are saying hurtful and/or ignorant things, do yourself a favor and look up stuff about aspergers. Educate yourself. Don't purposefully be ignorant, you're really just embarrassing yourself. Nobody ""wants"" to have aspergers.

I want to make it clear that I absolutely do *not* plan on using aspergers as some sort of ""excuse"". We are all responsible for our lives and our actions. I wanted to know if my feelings were unreasonable or not, I simply wanted to know how others have reacted to their diagnosis. 

I am a nice guy, often quiet. It's very rare for me to be an ""asshole"". I'm warm and friendly, and although I have trouble socializing, it doesn't stop me from trying to grow as a person.

And sometimes they ask me why I rock or sway.

Under my covers is the warmest, safest, most cozy place to be.

My limbs can relax and all jokes are funnier when I’m wrapped up in them.

I think I might spend my whole life there if curiosity didn’t own me.

I get so proud of myself when I talk to people without trying.

Suddenly there’s a glimmer of hope that maybe I’m learning.

Maybe I’m learning so well that it will begin to come naturally to me.

But those moments are rare.

A green leaf on the sidewalk might call for my touch.

Even though it’s five feet and eight inches away from me, I bend down to touch it with one index finger.

I know if I don’t I’ll feel myself come out of my skin

And get that neurological shake in my chest that I know so well.

I’m curious about every person I see.

The intense desire to get to know numerous persons never wavers.

But I know I can’t,

Because people are not chess pawns and life is not a game of intelligence. 

I wish they were characters in a book though,

Because then I could learn all about them without opening my mouth.

Avoid the cracks,

Write perfectly rounded O’s,

Dot the “i” elegantly, precisely, and fully,

Tap the light switch the same number of times with both hands,

Don’t let your thumb touch the door handle,

Create symmetry whenever possible,

Or else they will die.

A lack of empathy?

No.

An inability to see myself.

Yes.

A face stares at me in the mirror every day

Yet I can’t really see her

And within hours I forget what she looks like completely

So I check and I check and I check

But I see the rest of them all too well.

I've been avidly following this subreddit, and this community for that matter, since last August- when I met and fell in love with an incredible man with Aspergers. Before he came into my life, I knew very little about autism in general, let alone the specifics of Aspergers. 

I fell head over heels. He was 20 at the time, surprisingly well adjusted and very advanced (a year ahead of his grade in college, honors student, overachiever) and an incredibly gifted musician. Music is his outlet, his muse, his tool to communicate. Music was the thread that broke him from the social shackles...music was his window to the outside world. 

His mother and I bonded and she shed a little light on who he was as a child- so quiet, so reserved but with the heart of a lion. He was picked on terribly and bullied but always perservered. He was homeschooled his whole life (cyberschool for high school) and participated heavily in sports and Boy Scouts and most of all, basketball. As a kid, basketball became his fixation, practicing for hours, studying the NBA. Eventually, as he grew, he found music as well.

Our relationship progressed really fast due to my own home issues, but push comes to shove, he proposed to me (diamond ring, on one knee, romantic night, perfect one liner, under the stars...incredible.) and we moved in together in a little over 3 months (more to the story, but anyway)-

It wasn't easy. I am a physically affectionate person, he's a little more withdrawn. I love ""sweet nothings"" but his affection comes from his loyalty. He doesn't comprehend the concept of physical intimacy, he doesn't derive comfort from the same as me. For a while, we used to grate on one another-

I was smothering, he was withdrawn. I felt emotionally neglected, he built up an emotional wall to me. I would pull my hair out trying to find food he'd eat, it was all very specific and very detailed. It was trying times, sometimes.

I started seeing a counselor who specializes in relationships with Aspergers and she gave me wonderful advice- keep a diary of all the little things you love about him or the sweet ways he tries to show you he cares...whenever you feel ""neglected"" because he doesn't lean in to kiss you first or doesn't want to cuddle all the time, read the book. Read a few lines- remember that the love is there in abundance, he just shows it in different ways.

Sometimes, he'll say ""I love you"" and cherish me in more stereotypical ways, sometimes it's a moment where I know he tries. In the front of my journal, which was a gift from him on my birthday, he wrote me a love letter. It's little things like that which keep me going.

I've fallen so in love with him and by default, I've become a walking advocate for anyone who has this condition. I can't help myself- if you share a trait that is in the man I want to spend the rest of my days with, I feel connected.

I know there's a good chance that one of our children someday may have AS- that's something I became okay with a long time ago. It wouldn't change the way I look at them, or the way I look at my man currently- I just need to become a little more adept at understanding their overabundance of love.

That's a little bit of my rant- I follow this community and I pore over information because in the end, I just want to love him better. I want to understand what he needs and help me figure out how to understand that he actually is meeting all of mine, just in ways that might go over my head.

Thank you for being you. Never let anyone tell you that you're weird or strange or messed up. You're beautiful people with beautiful minds.

1334783662.0,69,self.aspergers,sgo6i,It's like a prison.,86,17,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/sgo6i/its_like_a_prison/,"You spend your life never truely interacting with people. You are there, you talk to them, you laugh with them, but you are never really there with them. You are behind a wall. An impenatrable Soviet like Iron Curtain through which the government of your brain scrutinizes and censors every movement, every word, lest the world know that there is something wrong with you. Something disgustingly abnormal. But still things get out, and you know those odd looks you get all too well. The “what did you just say or do, don’t you know better?” The answer is, you know all too well better. You just lack the self awareness to percieve your surroundings and judge the appropriateness of your actions or words. A deadly silence falls upon the room and those eyes begin to bore into your soul, judging, judging, judging.

You dress odd. You either tend not to care how you look or look too good in the most innapropriate situations. You dress to impress because you feel you have something to prove. Something to make up for. “If I dress better maybe I can show them I’m a stand up guy?”

Your parents were always frustrated with you when you were younger. They wondered why you had all these problems. They constantly yelled at you, screamed, shook you, sometimes beat you because you didn’t give proper social responses. Didn’t respond well when they were mad at you, didn’t know why they were mad in the first place. Didn’t know whatever you did was wrong. So you assume innocense, and that made them more angry. It has made you hyper aware, and ultra critical of yourself.

As you grow up you realize there is help out there, but it’s a trade off. There is medication, but it only treats half the problem. It sedates you so you don’t notice your not fitting in, but it makes other people notice more. It also balloons you up like a whale, which further hurts your allready negative self image.

All in all you find one thing you latch onto. One odd thing you obsess over and have intricate knowledge of. It makes you a good career. Your teachers, as they had problems with you, always said you were one of thier brightest and quickest students. They knew it was you getting the good grades too, because you had no friends who could give you the answers.

So you live life behind a wall, always craving that sleep time, that retreating into a shell in which your friends on TV or the fictional people pixels you helped in your video games made you the hero. Many of us with Asbergers have chosen to stay in that fictional world, and for those who branch out it’s even worse. If you stay inside your shell you live an empty life, but if you live with the rest of the world you are constantly reminded how you don’t truly belong in it, or move with it. Your life carries on, and you make the best of it. You finally make friends, but all the time you are never really there. You are jailed by the judge, jury, and prosecutor of your Asbergers syndrome. It’s a prison.

EDIT: I never expected this post to have the impact that it did. If it really helped people i wouldnt mind it being cross-posted or reblogged. It seems I was able to sum up experiences for all of us, not just myself, and it clearified things for non aspergers people too.

This will probably not go down too well, but I want to share my opinion as a fellow AS sufferer... probably the wrong word for most of you... and maybe find some people in the same boat.

When I go on internet forums and stuff I always see things like 'It's not a disability, it's a difference, and I love that it's a part of who I am blah blah blah despite the difficulties and whatnot...' And I cannot relate. At all.

I rarely ever tell people about it. I was diagnosed ~6 years ago at ten and the last time I ever told someone about it was when I was 12. It's completely embarrassing and I hate bringing it up. When my parents blame my PMS on my Aspergers I just about die. I feel like I can never vent or behave any way other than perfectly lest I be branded with freak status.

I'm not denying that I have it, I mean, eye contact with someone used to be the most frightening thing in the world for me (no longer, thank you Jesus) and I was antisocial, I had obsessions, whatever. Now I do whatever the hell I possibly can to convince people that I'm NT. I don't obssess over things. Ever. If I feel my interests start to narrow down towards something I stop. Just stop. I can still enjoy those things but I'm not going to build a shrine or whatever else I used to do.

And also, this is going to get me downvoted to the depths of hell, but this other thing also really frustrates me. My mother is the president of our local AS support group and she basically is the most smug person on the planet who loves to describe in horrendous detail the lifelong struggle it has been to raise me. These support meetings also give me the chance to meet other AS kids whilst their parents plan mardi-gras style acceptance of self parades and whatever else. And for the most part, I can't stand any of them.

It's always the same, every meeting. The kids are awkward and rude without even being aware of it, they all dress oddly and talk ad nauseam about their strangely detailed interests (circuits in cars, for example), they parade their AS status, and condemn their more popular peers as a 'back step in evolution.' All of them seem to hate me too, because I dress normally, wear make-up, shut up when needed, and basically spend my days hiding in a crowd of similarly dressed, semi-popular teenagers. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not always nice to those who do go to school with me, but I just really really really don't want to be like 'them.' They say I'm a fake because I don't fit the odd, lonely, misfit-type bill, but to be honest I'm really glad I don't.

Pleeease please tell me I'm not alone in this vein of thought. Also, bring on the criticism because honestly I am sick to death of this whole 'boo-hoo, I have AS' type stuff. I understand many people deal with much worse than myself but everybody has their own trials.

I will often take an unpopular stance, but in doing so will at least address opposing arguments, acknowledge assumptions, etc. in order to establish that stance, while many others (always NTs within this group) will often demonstrate a failure to deconstruct their own opinions or discriminate opinion from fact and assertion from argument, will defend factual incorrectness or logical contradiction with ""I'm allowed to have an opinion, man"" etc.  They're often pleasant, good-natured, friendly and kind people, it's just hard to have any kind of discussion with them of any depth.

(For the record, I am very high functioning, but there are something's I get very stressed out about from time to time, which my parents know.) 

They were telling me it's their money they are spending and they should have the final say in how I spend my university experience. As we were arguing about whether I should take more courses, my mom hit me with this. 

""Stop being so Asperger's and just deal with your problems!"" 

I have never felt so misunderstood. This is not a new thing for them. They know I have difficulty. They just assume that because I'm okay with some things, I should be okay with others. They always compare me to other people and ask why I am not like them. It's like they think I choose to be Asperger's when its convenient. I really feel alone right now and I'm not sure what to do.

EDIT: I should mention that we have been fighting and arguing since I was five. We have never gotten along ever. Between that and my problems, by now they are just tired of dealing with me, and me with them. Also my reasoning for taking 3 courses instead of five is that I rather it be too easy and then add more, than find it too difficult and have problems.

I have never hung out with girls ever and have filled that loneliness with weed for years. Just became sober two months ago, perminantly.
I felt too awkward to ever be around girls.


Anyways one girl who went to my elementary school started talking to me a while back.

We went out for coffee a few days ago and found out we have a lot in common, and connect extremely well. She learned i have aspergers. She proceded to point out her best freind has AS as well and she saw nothing wrong with me.

We can talk about anything. She understands im different and appreciates it.

Today we hung out at her house and cuddled (ive never fucking done this) watched some tv and then talked about life. 

She found out id never kissed a girl and said shed be honored to be my first kiss. I kissed her and i was immediately in shock? Not sure what word to describe it.

She didnt have any judgement of me. The whole night, on the couch, in the car dropping me off at my house, to my fucking courtyard, against my garage, we 'practiced' making out for a very long time, in the cold rain. Ive never felt this feeling in my life. Its amazing and life is worth it.

We had some issues with pressure contact suction etc and what i was doing with my hands. I was pretty awkward and stopped to criticize myself but she just smiled and wanted me to kiss her more.

Cold rainy night.

The night ended with me walking her to her car with no awkwardness in our conversation at all, telling her learning to make out was like learning to play piano or drums. It takes practice before i know exactly what im doing.

TlDr:
I have aspergers. I felt alone and rejected my whole life, i had no real freinds. I had no hope id ever meet a girl who likes me.

I have met someone who knows i have AS and thinks it doesnt matter and makes me interesting. We love talking to eachother. We talk about anything, even stuff i wouldnt have ever told any guy. Had my first kiss. Fuck life is good.

So dont fucking lose hope. This isnt the only girl like this in the world. Keep practicing and trying.",,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,,True,t3_1bnbsz,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1bnbsz/update_is_there_any_hopeapperantly_fuck_yes/,

1352043314.0,52,self.aspergers,12m4g4,Update: My 28yr-old virgin Aspie colleague asked me to have sex with her.  Finally we did.,64,12,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/12m4g4/update_my_28yrold_virgin_aspie_colleague_asked_me/,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/z0qo8/my_28year_old_aspergers_colleague_just_told_me/


**TL;DR: Finally we did, and now it's a semi-regular event. But just sex.**

I'm not sure if this is a relationship or not. She'll sometimes, about once in two weeks or so, ask if I'm free on a particular night.  Then she'll come over, have a drink or snack, then go to bed with me.  She doesn't express any interest in shared activities other than cooking or watching TV, and never stays over.  She even sets an alarm on her phone to make sure she doesn't miss her train home.

The act itself is really, really good-- she's incredibly adventurous and always wants to try something new that I suspect she saw online or read about. She's even started bringing over toys &amp; props.

 But it wasn't like that from the beginning.

In fact, the first time was a completely abortive effort. She spent about 10 minutes just looking me over because she'd never seen a man naked before ""in person"", and was fascinated with getting me an erection and letting it fade and getting erect again. Shen she finally decided we should try penetration, she let me get about an inch in, stopped me and had me hold it there, then said it hurt and we should stop.  And left.

For the next few days at work she said nothing and didn't even acknowledge me (as is often usual for her), but about a week later asked if she could come over that night.

And this time it went further, and slowly she has gotten really into it.  But in all this time we've never kissed, and she rarely if ever makes eye contact during the act.

I enjoy her company and conversation. It can be a little one-sided, but she gets very excited too talk about some subjects, and I like listening to her. 


 From my side a relationship isn't out of the question, but will it turn out to be more than this at some point?   Or will it just stay limited like this?

I'm not sure I have a question, actually.    This is mainly an update because several people asked.  But still, it would be nice to know if this is the start of something or just play activities.

Why am I saying this?  Because now that we're all just ""Autistic"", all we're seeing are articles like this where people can't even care for themselves, can't speak, can't even communicate, have mental retardation, etc - while most of us with Asperger's are highly functional, extremely intelligent and are often highly successful in life.  As a child, I listened to my parents, and wasn't a trainwreck, screaming and not paying attention to social norms *that I was taught*.  I have always been able to take care of myself fine, and I have friends and a social life, relatively on par with other people with Asperger's.

Today, to describe myself as Autistic, when things like this are all they publish just makes me CRINGE.  THIS IS NOT ME.  I am very empathetic that those people need help in their own way, but this large bucket does NOT describe me, and given the media's portray of Autistics (which is correct, for those who are not Aspies), it's guaranteed as so.  Am I the only one who feels this way?

I spend so much time completely alone.

My wife (who also has aspergers) works nights, so we don't see each other much. She's a nurse so it comes with 12 hour shifts. I try to stay up late on nights that she's off, but when she sleeps in until 10pm, we still don't get much time together. I don't fault her, though, and in fact I'm extremely proud of her. I just wish we had more time together.

My best friend of 18 years stopped talking to me two years ago. He never said why. I moved across the country a few years before that, but will frequently would visit each other and talked on the phone for a few hours a day. I was mad at first, but now I just miss having someone to talk to.

My other very close friends are in other parts of the country too. One has a new life and we don't talk very often, now. The other is constantly busy and has trouble calming back down because of her aspergers. I'm lucky to talk to her on the phone once every 2-3 months (but it's always for four hours or more). My wife and I are moving to her city next year, so things should be better, then.

As for friends here, I have a few. Two of the best ones have moved (one to another state, one to an hour away). We don't hang out hardly ever anymore. All my other friends don't answer my text messages and if they do, never want to hang out. We all play Magic the Gathering, and I set up nights for us to play at my place once a week. Everyone always says they'll be here, but then cancel an hour before they're supposed to come.

The shop I play Magic at is the most popular in this part of the country and it's always extremely crowded. Due to that, I can't go there every week (and when I do, it's over an hour away). Even if I make it, that's only one day a week and I spend the next six alone.

I've picked up a bad habit, again, and have started going to stores and buying random things just so the cashiers will talk to me. This is not only pathetic, but it's draining me of money I don't have to spend.

My communication through writing is quite strong. I'm satisfied with this aspect of my communication.

Once it's verbal though - it's a lot worse. I cover it up better as an adult for the most part, but as a child I used to be constantly teased by my peers for how I spoke. People used to surround me during lunch time to mock me and ask, ""Why do you talk so weird?"" and ""We don't know what you're trying to say.""

I find it difficult to put my words in order when I want to speak. So I either have these weird pauses in the middle of sentences, followed by a cascade of words and more pauses, or I have to simplify them because I just can't figure out how to structure my thoughts properly. Or I rehearse incessantly in my head before I speak so I'm basically reading off a script. I find that if I keep repeating some words and sounds, it buys time to structure sentences and indicates to my audience that I'm not finished. So I guess that's why I ""stutter"", and it's also probably why the more relaxed and talkative I feel, the more prominent it becomes [less chance for scripted responses].

I wanted to make sure I didn't ramble or get into territory where I'd say something dumb.  I guess it worked.  Plus, during the interview the new people actually *wanted* me to elaborate on my technical skills.  My current job hates it when I talk tech.  So I'm really hoping that the fact that I like to talk shop will finally be ok somewhere.

One other thing I need to do is buy some new clothes.  Ugh, I hate shopping.  Thankfully, I can wear dockers/khakis and polos everyday and be just fine.

Today, at age 40, I went to the dentist for the first time. 
Lemme state that I don't have a mouth full of rotting teeth either. I take very good care of my mouth. 

But, I've been petrified of going to a dentist all my life and never could make myself go. 
A couple of weeks ago, I opted for new insurance plans and included dental. Then, I made an appointment. 
Today, I showed up. 

It freaked me out, having someone in my personal space like that. I mean all up in my mouth. It was definitely weird. 

And in the end I felt like my mouth has been a race track for one of those little metal spider things in the Matrix.

What I enjoyed: The buffing compound used to polish my teeth was a neat sensation. I equated it to what I'd done with numerous motorcycle and car parts I've polished over the years. 

In the end, I found I had one tiny tiny little cavity forming. And the dentist commended me on taking such good care of my teeth over the years, adding that the filling I would get for the cavity would likely last me decades given the superior oral care I exercise. 

So, it scared the crap out of me and I did it. I'm not posting this from hell or Valhalla, so I didn't die. I didn't freak out. I didn't have any negative reactions other than ""ow! Fuck!"" a few times. 

And now I'm looking for the next thing to challenge myself with in the coming month or so. 

I would encourage you, if you find yourself paralyzed or even intimidated by fear or anxiety, to face one of your fears and see what happens.

What moveset do you usually use on it? What are really good counters for this Pokemon? How has your playstyle of this Pokemon changed between the different generations?"", etc etc etc.

Very useless. This technology allows people to imagine how parents might feel when their autistic kids don’t make eye contact with them.

Yes. It’s a simulation exercise to make people aware of the utter heartbreak of having a child who struggles with eye contact. Except, of course, in this video, the child isn’t struggling. The child simply does not make eye contact at all. Ever.

I'm leaving out all the many challenges we faced along the way, because this is a story of what an amazing person she is, not the many difficulties encountered.

Her first word, uttered at around 18 months, was ""shit"". She'd dropped a sippy cup in the kitchen, the lid popped off and grape juice splattered all over the floor. As excited as I was to hear her correctly pronounce a complete word as well as use it in context, I was reticent to share the news with her grandparents, who were at the time very conservative christian leaders in their church. Fortunately, her vocabulary expanded quickly to include many far more generally acceptable words.

She spent most of her toddler-hood wandering naked in the back yard, exploring with great interest some new bug or plant. On one occasion, from inside I became aware of her hollering at the top of her lungs. I ran out to find her standing stalk-still directly on a fire ant nest, covered from toes to waist with angry biting ants. Later, she would warn others about the fire ants, explaining in great detail how they worked in a group to defend their home.

She was a ""climber"", and at around age 5 made her way to the top of a tree. She got scared and wanted me to get her down. I explained that she'd have to find her own way. That really pissed her off and the catterwauling began. Two hellish hours later (I don't know how the neighbors didn't call CPS), she finally made her way down, clawing and falling and still crying and screaming. Her interest in climbing didn't wane, but never again did she climb higher than she was able to get down. In a related story, at about age 12, she got angry and frustrated and marched off into the woods surrounding our house. An hour later one of my friends burst in the front door and said, ""you know where your kid is?"". I said, ""yeah, she's off in the woods blowing off steam."" My friend said, ""you'd better follow me"". Turns out my daughter was fast asleep, 30 feet in the air, on a tree limb that extended over the drive. All I could do was shrug. Very common for her, but clearly alarming for my friend.

At age 6, while at the beach, she tugged on my arm and said, ""have I ever told you about the Giant Pelagic Jellyfish?"" I replied, ""is Pelagic a word?"" She filled me in on everything from the creature's size, eating and mating habits, to the depth at which it lives in the ocean. Her thirst for knowledge about all living things never waned. Even now, if anyone in the family sees an unfamiliar insect, plant or animal, my daughter is the ""go-to"" gal. Generally she'll provide the latin names first, but then explain it in terms the rest of us understand.

She got involved in theater during high school, and figured out she could sing. I mean, this kid's got a set of lungs! She was frequently compared to Etta James, and ended up winning more than one ""High-School Idol"" contest. Halfway through her junior year, she lost interest in High School, so I shipped her off to my mother's house. She took her GED (scoring 100% on several sections) and enrolled in community college. Two years later, Associate's Degree in-hand, she was accepted by two well-known universities. After touring the campuses, she chose the one with more forest around it. No surprise.

She's tall, athletic, and freakishly strong, but team sports have never been her thing. I encouraged her to go have a chat with the Rowing coach at her university. Approximately 20 minutes after he first set eyes on her, she had a spot on the team and learned to love Crew. They ended up taking the DII championship. Around this time, she started getting bored of school again, and decided to take a break.

She hitch-hiked with a friend up and down the West Coast, and then decided to spend a few months in Spain, spending time at two separate farm-stay places before launching off on her own to bumble about with a few international hippies. Oh my, the stories she has. Taught herself to play the Didgeridoo while there, and has become proficient enough that local farmer's markets ask her to perform. Within about a two-week period, she learned to play the guitar and can now quite comfortably accompany herself singing.

One more thing. Also while in High School, she had an opportunity to travel to South America with an eco-tourism group. She became so proficent in Spanish during that first three-week period, that the next year she was able to serve as translator for the group.

Yup. She's amazing. Hard to believe this is the same kid who wore bifocals, beat her head against the wall for hours, couldn't look anyone in the eye, would not play with other kids and pulled out great chunks of hair in frustration. But it is. Awesome!

EDIT: She also draws stuff, most of which is with her, but I found a few silly sketches laying around the house.

My son wrote his father a very assertive email asking him to take his diagnosis seriously.  My son wrote that he has no routine at his dad’s house and that he is not normal. He told his dad that he only wants up to 5 hours with him at a time and he does not want to go to his dad’s house. He asked for 2 days notice if his dad could come get him.  His dad called him on the phone and said he agreed and would do it.  A month later went by and his dad did not text or call him.

Then Friday during school, his dad texts him “I am coming to get you today or tomorrow”.  This caused a lot of unexpected stress.  He was not acknowledging the 2 days notice my son was asking for.  This happened the next weekend too.

SO then it was time for mediation.  I proposed a compromise of him getting our son EVERY Sunday from 1 PM to 5 PM to still accommodate what my son requested in the letter.  His dad’s counter offer was he only wants to have him two separate weeks in the summer and alternating holidays.  He did not ask for any weekends or Spring Break.   It was a shock that he asked for so little time.

His dad's child support went up just a little to accommodate the ongoing therapy costs but he is no longer ordered to reimburse 50 % which is the reason I took him to court in the first place....I do have all exclusive rights to make educational, medical and psychological decisions now too.  His dad does not want me to send him the school paperwork any more. I am only obligated to notify him what has been done in a short email. .  Now it is a court order. 

When I told my son, he was fine with it and his first reaction was “what will I be doing there for a week”?  I told him he could still text and tell his dad about upcoming school events and invite him to come.  So after about a year of waiting (since last July), this is how it ended.  My son gets his needs met and is happy with me and my husband.

The reddit community really responded to me and gave me great advise on the previous post so I wanted to let everyone know how it ended up.

To read more about the guidelines and rules we have for our subreddit, [go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules).

I am here to invite users with AS or anyone else for that matter who have a burning interest in history. We need more contributors and where better to look than amongst the people I know would have the knowledge we're seeking? I am certain there must be users on here who had or currently have a special interest in an aspect of history. Nothing is too focused or broad, as long as it's facts and something that can be backed up by sources if asked to. 

If this sounds interesting to you or if you might just be curious on something historically and want to ask a question, then please head over to /r/AskHistorians!

I observe 2 classes of patterns, and I do not know what to call them.

The first class are patterns I find myself latching onto, I think, as a way of reducing distractions. For example, when thinking about something I'll sometimes rub my fingers along the edge of a plastic zipper feeling the bumps as I move back and forth. I might find myself staring at a visual pattern in a carpet as I'm listening to somebody talk, tracing the pattern with my eyes. I think that because patterns, by their nature are predictable, focusing on them, even if unconsciously, reduces the amount of unanticipated input, and therefore stress.

The other class of patterns I notice are patterns I do not think others notice very often. These are sometimes patterns of behavior, or patterns in systems - almost always they are not patterns that are designed, or intentional. For example, I think I can tell how much stress a specific friend is under by what she eats (we eat out together frequently). When she is happy and relaxed, she almost usually orders a salad, or something healthy; however when she is stressed she will tend to order less healthy choices (e.g. hamburger and fries). I have not told her this, but it helps me to gauge her mood. I also have had bad experiences pointing things like this out to people.

Anyway, I do not know what to name those classes of patterns, but the second class is more interesting to me than the first, although also more difficult to find.

The main objective of this study is to collect data on the safety of MDMA-assisted therapy in autistic adults, and to use standard clinical measures to estimate the extent to which MDMA-assisted therapy may reduce social anxiety symptoms in this group.

&gt; My husband and I have been together for close to a decade. In the beginning, I admired his ability to see the logic in everything. I still do, but I'm also left feeling empty and neglected quite often.

&gt; Right now I'm laying in bed crying as I type this on my phone. He came to bed a few minutes ago and put his arm around me and fell asleep. No comforting, no asking if I'm okay, nothing.

Comments were coming in, and she edited it with this:

&gt; Thank you for your responses. I think I brought this to the wrong forum. It was late and I felt desperate. I'm feeling very overwhelmed by the responses that sound just like my husband, and I can't read anymore right now. If you read this, PLEASE DON'T RESPOND TO ME. Thanks again for your willingness to help.

This really struck me. She was looking for a hug, but she received homework.

The following day, someone empathized with her emotionally, but it was another NT:

&gt; As an NT wife of an aspie, I feel your pain. I'm often left feeling empty, and am not sure how to go about it either.

That day she posted this to a different page:

&gt; For all the positives in our marriage, I still crave an emotional connection that I don't think I'll ever get from him. That makes me incredibly sad. I know you can't expect to have all your needs met by your spouse, but that feels like an important thing to be lacking from what's supposed to be the most important relationship in your life.

She loves him, but she's missing something.

I just checked her profile, and about a week ago she replied to someone's question about quitting their life to start over. She said that she was, ""itching to do it again"", and while there is consideration for spouse and kids, ""I think the world would be a much BETTER place if we all followed our dreams.""

It almost sounds like she wants out of the marriage.

But this isn't a new problem. It's a common theme, and some people wonder if they ""[should even be in a relationship](http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/zn426/should_i_even_be_in_a_relationship/)"":

&gt; She knows some of the limitations (I hate the word ""challenges"" — say it like it is) of my thought processes and emotions, but I don't think she's fully groked that she won't ever be loved like she wants to be, no matter how much she loves me. I won't love her as much, I won't show it in the same way, and it's going to be hard for both of us. And let's not get into the sex drive disparity (suffice it to say I've gone years without before with no ill effect).

Besides the emotional emptiness, the physical touch and sexual intimacy are common concerns too:

&gt; Our sex life is abysmal. I've always thought he had a rather low sex drive, but recently he shared with me that he engages in self-service on a daily basis.

Then last week an article was posted, ""[Married to someone with Aspergers](http://www.ivillage.com/forums/node/4989427)"", where an NT woman basically bashes her AS ex-husband to warn others of the torment she endured:

* Many describe living with an Aspie as ""water torture.""
* With limited empathy for others, you can't really connect.
* This mind blindness leaves the spouse wondering if she is understood or cared for or trusted by her Aspie partner.
* He will do what he thinks is best for the both of them but seldom talks to her about her feelings or opinions. And if she tries to share her love for him, he may find her need to ""connect"" smothering.
* Often these relationships are without sexual intimacy.
* He has no need to understand her so her complaints are bothersome to him.
* An Aspie husband and Neuro-typical (NT) wife are often described as like two insulated wires wrapped around each other, touching but not connecting.

She is part of a support group for other women in NT-AS relationships, [AspergersAndOtherHalf](http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/AspergersAndOtherHalf/). There are 1,704 members, and males are not allowed. It says it's for female spouses to connect with other women, who understand the realities of relationships with a partner on the spectrum, and that it's a safe place to talk, and receive empathy and support.

With all of this, it almost sounds like AS means *failures in love*. Like they should just be forever alone, except for the cats who might put up with them.

But is that really what it means?

Kirsten is an AS young woman who publishes online, and there is an article with her in *The New York Times* called, ""[Navigating Love and Autism](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/us/navigating-love-and-autism.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2)"".

In one section it talks about her extroverted high school boyfriend trying to teach her to thrive socially:

&gt; Noting her tendency to speak in a monotone, he urged her to be more expressive. He sought to quiet her hand movements, gave her personal hygiene tips (“You can’t do that,” he told her flatly when she used her fingers to scoop up food she had dropped on a table at Taco Bell and ate it) and pointed out the unspoken social cues she often missed. He elbowed her as she spoke for long minutes to an acquaintance about her interest in animal physiology. “When people look away,” he explained, “it means they’re not interested.”

&gt; “You’re not a robot,” he insisted, intending to comfort her. “I know you can do this. You’re a human being.” But not, she thought, the kind he wanted her to be.

That doesn't sound fun. That doesn't sound like he's connecting with her. It's always presented as a problem with the AS, where they're the one not connecting. But maybe it goes the other way too?

The article goes on to paint Jack, her future Aspie boyfriend, as her savior, because she could apparently feel more comfortable. It sounded like the extroverted guy who was training her was nowhere near satisfied with her, and it'd just be a matter of time before he grew frustrated and broke up with her.

But with the AS guy, she was comforted that he wouldn't leave her. He was something else, connecting with her in a different way, that seemingly felt better. He was Aspie, she was Aspie, and they could find ways to bond over that, fitting with peculiarities.

For some, maybe none of this is an issue, and they're compatible with NT on all levels. But it's surely an issue that keeps being raised, except that it's usually framed as the AS being defective.

Why do AS people want to attempt mating with the general population, without first making sure they are compatible when it comes to things like emotional and sexual intimacy? It almost seems like AS people have a sensitivity of feeling inferior, and want to attempt a struggle to fit in, and prove they can be just like everyone else.

But then look what happens. Even in the cases where an NT and AS incompatible in this way make it work, it's not just the NT who is missing something, it's the AS who is too. Everyone seems to ignore that. The AS is struggling too, and isn't fully connecting how they could with someone who isn't needing the things they can't provide.

It goes beyond AS/NT too. If a non-AS is asexual, and an AS has issues with touching and sexual intimacy, then that might work too. The question is just, why do some people torture themselves, instead of just finding someone who fully appreciates them, and adores the AS stuff, not missing anything because they feel the same way?

I think besides just being undiagnosed, not knowing better, or getting swept away with love they can't control, that a lot of it is that inferior mindset. But look at the concept illustrated with Kirsten's story. They might not be the poster for perfect AS-AS romance, but can't you just imagine that guy feeling better to be with her than some woman like that AS-basher with the support group? Why not find partners who adore the AS stuff like that?

Even if an incompatible NT is in love with AS, is it optimal for them to stay together and get married when it's already known what problems often arise? Would both be happier with someone who connects differently and appreciates their so-called defects? Or do you think it's better to just let love take shape naturally however it wants, without oversight, and that the AS-NT relationships that do work are somehow better or equal to AS-AS?

Then there's the question of children. There was a post from an NT wife seeing how the AS husband didn't connect with the children, and the problems that caused. How does that work with AS-AS compatible relationships? Do they have AS children? Is it then a whole happy family who get each other? Or do they not have children, and use their AS skills for producing in other ways?",,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,,True,t3_13qci9,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/13qci9/why_do_aspies_torture_themselves_trying_to_fit/,

Growing up, kids tortured me and no one did anything. They would push me and push me and push me until I exploded and then the adults would punish me. I got labeled as a “problem” child. This was before Aspergers was widely known about.

Now as an adult I am completely disconnected from people. I have one friend. I have my mother who is there for me, even though she doesn’t understand me at all. 

The hardest part of all is that I have no fucking clue what I am doing wrong. I feel very normal to me. I don’t feel like any of the things i say or do are super outside the norm--there is such a huge range of human activity, how can a few minor differences matter SO MUCH?

I get the impression that I am horrible to be around. I’m somehow weird or wrong. The “weirdness” seems to disgust people. They don’t want to hear me talk. They cut me off or just say something rude. Even with people who are nice and who I would consider good acquaintances if not friends I can tell what an effort it is for them to be patient with me. I don’t get invited places. If I do get invited once, I never get invited again. If I go I get a feeling like people are thinking “Why are you here.” Even if they are polite and aren’t mean about it, I can tell they just want me to go away. I feel like I somehow suck the fun out of parties. People will sit around doing nothing until i leave and then I hear the next day how off the hook the party was after I left. If I stay, the party never goes off and people leave early.

I try  so hard not to say anything bad or offensive. To wait for appropriate pauses in conversation. To not be too random. To not overshare. Not act too desperate or clingy or whatever.  I try not to be too loud and make sure not to be inappropriate/vulgar. But I also desperately want to be able to be myself and not just an actor playing the role of “normal.” If people like that actor, that still means they don’t really like ME, because that person is not really who I am. Also, no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to totally pass for normal on a long term basis. I can fake short encounters and some things I’ve have learned to manage so that at least they aren’t traumatic. Having to put out that kind of energy and concentration just to make it though a few hours is exhausting. I cannot do this on a day to day basis. I feel like I’m going to have a nervous breakdown because I can’t keep track of all the millions of random things i’m supposed to do or not supposed to do at any given time. Oh yeah, and consciously monitoring the expression on my face, my mannerisms, random body language so that I can give off the “right” messages.

Sometimes I still try, I don’t want to make people uncomfortable. I don’t want to be a burden to be around. 

But also, I simply HAVE to be myself, at least to some extent. I think it’s wrong/evil to make myself over into some shell of a facade for other people simply in order to be liked. 

I don’t seem so unlikable to myself. I don’t do anything that I would think would be such a deal--I’m not lying and cheating people. I’m not being a douchbag. I understand what these things are and they disgust me. I’ve learned where most of the major social faux pas lie and avoid them. It’s much more subtle. It doesn’t seem to be something obvious. 

I’m so lonely--and I haven’t a fucking clue what I’m doing wrong that makes people find me so damn distasteful. It doesn’t seem to be any of the “normal” things that I can think of. And now I’m so anxious because I don’t know how to be that I’m turning into a total spaz.

Anyway, this wasn’t supposed to be a pity party about me--I started out just trying to describe the situation. 

I guess I’m writing this because I’m just so frustrated and sad and it’s starting to make me depressed. Living this way for the next 50 or 60 years sounds like a nightmare (though I have no urge to kill myself or anything like that--I feel like that’s quitting and I don’t quit.)

Obviously everyone is unique, with or without Asperger's, but I found for myself that I could relate more to this very list, instead of some others. Maybe you feel similar, let me know your thoughts :)

*As people with Asperger's have a normal IQ or even higher, it is hard to instantly pick up on their difficulties in a social situation*

*Some suffer from 'being different' and feel they have to put on an act. They have learnt how to disguise/hide their difficulties. (Believe me, I haven't)*

*Numerous have made peace with being 'Aspie' and use the positive side effects that can appear:*

* A lot of people with Asperger's are **honest** and can not see the negative effects that might pop up by sharing their opinions. This might be seen as naive, but can also have a positive twist on friendships or employment relations.

* Employees are used to work highly concentrated over a large amount of time, without losing motivation (as long as they are interested in the topic) and have great attention to details. Having an expertise or narrow field of special interest can actually have many advantages.

* Unfortunately this also comes with some negative side effects; like lack of self confidence, inflexibility and little spontaneity.

* **Don't diagnose Asperger's - DISCOVER it!** Asperger's can be seen as a strong trait of qualities and abilities. Think of it as being very talented (i. e. in music, science etc)

* *Aspie* is defined by: loyalty, impartiality, candidness, presentation of opinions and theories, enthusiasm for certain ideas, **avoidance of useless and shallow conversation**, verbosity, attention to detail, creativity, good memory, insistence, tidiness, understanding and many more.

Funny thing is people who don't understand me... or my different ways relate my behaviors as being like that character.  Personally, I know why people have to stereotype and am guilty of it of course but they don't have as harsh a tone or reaction. I don't quite feel as out of place.  When you don't get jokes, are extremely serious and have a asynchronous view to the rest of your colleagues you stick out.  It is especially so because I am not  hidden in a tech industry.  That people laugh at the character and he somehow helps them not see me as strange.  It is nice.   My boss who has always thought me ""different"" even tells his friends he works with someone like Sheldon Cooper.  I am not sure I like that but he doens't get AS frustrated as he once did.

Why?,38,6,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1c2m2n/brain_freezes_when_processing_verbal_instructions/,"I don't know why but I often find it very difficult to process verbal instructions. Today I've been studying physics with a couple of people from my class. I think physics is rather difficult and I have a big exam on Monday so I'm a bit stressed out. Anyway, at one point when we were solving physics problems I was supposed to write on the blackboard while they read out the problem and the facts etc. I just couldn't understand/couldn't hear what they were saying. I had to read the problem on my own to figure out what I was supposed to do. When they read it it was like my brain just froze. It's far from the first time something like that has happened. I very often need to read things in order to understand them and if someone reads me something or gives me instructions (no matter what it's about) I can't focus and my brain freezes. 

Another problem I have is that unless I don't fully understand something I can't really move on. I get stuck on something and unless someone explains it to me very specifically I'll eventually give up and instead of moving on to the next physics problem (for example) I get completely distracted and end up doing nothing. Because of this I ask a lot of questions and when studying today I think my two classmates got annoyed with me. At least that's what it seemed like at times. I also think at least one of them sometimes thinks I'm stupid because I don't process things the way she does and because I get distracted so easily (she said some things today which made it sound like she thought I was stupid). I'm not stupid. I think my brain gets overwhelmed or something. 

Anyway, it often makes me feel useless and depressed. On top of that, the guy working in the university cafeteria where I bought cutlery today said something using sarcasm. I completely missed it and responded in the wrong way which was rather embarrassing. Sometimes I'm good at detecting sarcasm but other times I'm completely useless.

He screamed at me and said stuff to me like how I should be ashamed of myself for watching things little kids like, that I'm not a real man, etc. I probably wouldn't have had that hard a time had he caught me watching pornography. That's how bad it was. Thankfully I moved away and could be myself to my heart's content, but it was tough growing up.

I just want to take a minute to thank /aspergers for being an amazing and accepting subreddit.  I have just recently been diagnosed and I find more and more AS traits describing me and my actions and it is really transforming my life.  For instance,  I used to have crippling social anxiety but, I'm starting to realize my anxiety was simply a fear of being treated differently and being socially unaccepted because of how I act around others.  Now that I understand this fear, it is becoming much easier to overcome it instead of allowing it to spiral out of control.  I'm now learning why I think the way I do and that it's completely natural for me and there are tons of others( you guys :-D) that think the same way.  When I notice strange looks for saying or doing something, I can simply shrug it off because I know that's just who I am and how I think.  I have aspergers and I'm not going to apologize for who I am.  I'll play the cards I was dealt and I'm going to perfect the things I do in life down to every small detail.  I'm immune to any manipulative social manuvers anyone trys to pull.  I don't give two shits about breaking social norms and exposing truth to a situation.  I will fine tune any activity I want to be good at and master it to a degree far beyond what most people are capable of doing.  Having aspergers is not a disability.  On the contrary, it's an incredible gift that I am fortunate to have.  Thank you all for your posts in this subreddit.

I always knew that our opposing views on things would be an issue in the future, but my recent diagnosis has really exacerbated the circumstances. I'm concerned that she won't fully respect me because she will eventually grow to resent my refusal and continue to believe this is something I can easily cure.

My Life Hack is to wear sunglasses whenever I leave home on account of social anxiety issues and on account of being sensitive to bright lights. If I spend too much time inside a building with fluorescent lights, I feel as if I am escaping from the Vault in Fallout 3 for the first time. Also, I hate making eye contact with people I do not know well because it literally feels like they are staring into my soul. The sunglasses always make me feel more confident, not only because eye contact is not as bad, but because it makes me harder to read and makes me feel like I am on a more even playing field. I will wear them inside if I can sit near a window.

Yes, I get that many people are still angry or in mourning, and yes, I understand what it is like to experience the loss of someone close to me. However, this does not change the fact that I feel detached from the event.

I'm very much an extrovert, so with the lack of a filter that comes with Asperger's, these situations happen far too often.

Here's my story:

I went to a minor-league baseball game with my then-girlfriend (now wife), her sister, and their dad. About midway through the game, I looked off to my side and saw an empty can of Bud Light. I had always wondered what it would be like to smash a beer can on my head, and being an Aspie, that became my all-consuming thought for the moment. In my mind, I pictured myself grabbing the can, smashing it on my head, tossing it aside, my S.O. saying something like, ""Was that really necessary?"" and then it'd be done. 

So, forgetting that I had a very public audience due to my momentary fixation -- including my future in-laws next to me -- I grabbed the can, stood up, took the can, tried to smash it on my head, and just knocked myself silly with the can. This, of course, was the moment that knocked me out of fixation mode and into reality. 

My S.O. and her sister, who watched me randomly stand up and try this charade, were in hysterics laughing at me afterward -- literally pointing and laughing, doubled-over. I understood, of course. It was a moment when an autistic fixation kind of caught up to me, and luckily it ended well (not only with one of my favorite stories, but three days later her dad, who witnessed this, gave me his permission to marry his daughter).

I told 11 people besides my parents and one professor about my diagnosis (all acquaintances that I told--not any of the few friends I consider very close).  
I was looking for validation that I was ""normal"" and that a label didn't change anything about me.  I had never had anyone close to me go through what I'm going through; the process is new, scary, and lonely.  For about a week I was convinced that I had somehow changed because I had this new information and I didn't like the person I was turning into.  Today I had an enlightenment.  
There is nothing ""wrong"" with me.  I just interact with people differently than the majority of others, and I see my label as a way for the majority of people to justify how others can interact differently.  I want to say that I'm going ""back to the way I was before I found out"" but that would imply that something changed after I found out.  Rather, I'm going back to how I am when I am not dealing with stress and anxiety that turn me into a horrible person to be around.  Having this information should not change the way I interact with people or how I see myself.  
I am still dealing with the daunting task of seeing somebody to talk about my Asperger's, but I am not going to let it continue to stress me out and make me anxious.  I have not been myself because I have been dealing with what I saw as an issue for the last month.  I no longer see it as an issue, it's just part of me, and it doesn't make me crazy or unwell or abnormal.  I just hope that my stress-induced meltdowns haven't convinced any of my friends otherwise.

Dad knew he wanted to be a chemist ever since he was 7.  His mom didn't buy him a chemistry set because she wanted him to go out and play with the other kids.  He worked summers starting at age 10 in order to build himself chemistry sets from scratch.  He taught himself calculus at 10 and already knew the whole introductory chemistry curriculum before he finally got to take the class.  Dad really blossomed in college, earning his PhD and having a long career in his dream job of organic chemistry research and development. 

Mom and Dad only had one kid together - me.  Mom had two older kids from a previous marriage.  She was thrilled to meet a man who would be loyal and a provider for her.  They have been married for 30 years.  Dad just got his diagnosis (at the age of 53), and while that has been a transition in the way I look at my past and how my mom views her marriage, I couldn't be more proud of my dad.  

As for me, I'm pretty much neurotypical, though I'm admittedly a little socially awkward after having someone also a little awkward as a parent.  Dad always encouraged me to be curious about the world and to devise experiments.  Now I'm following in his footsteps by entering a PhD program of my own with the goal of landing a research job, but in a very different field (social industrial/organizational psychology).

My...fiancé has Aspergers and has recently left me but in an odd manner. He'd been getting more angry and we did have an argument (about something really stupid) where the outcome was that he said that he had really wanted to kick my teeth in (which is not like him at all, he's one of the most placid people you'd ever meet) and it was the most angry he'd been for years and that it scared him.

After this, things were quiet and then he told me he wanted to move out, saying he needed to be alone for a while. When I asked him why, he said he didn't know, but he felt like he had to. When I asked if he still loved me, he said he didn't know. When I asked if he was coming back, he said he didn't know. 

He then proceeded to not speak to me for about a month and has only recently asked for his possessions (there was more to it than that but I don't know if it's relevant). Every time I try and get him to talk, he won't. He'll only talk about what possessions he wants and if he says anything at all, it's just that he wants to be alone for a while and he doesn't know. Even when I tried to get more information out of him about what possessions he wanted, he was mostly unhelpful and unforthcoming. 

Everybody who knows me and him has said it's really weird and he's not acting like himself, even his friend who has known him for over ten years. He's said he doesn't feel safe around me and I'm unsure if this is because he doesn't know how he'll react around me. I would never want to hurt him or for him to be hurt, and have never hurt him physically (I don't know about emotionally, but if I did, it wasn't intentional) so I doubt it's a physical thing, of him being scared of me.

I have been trying to find information about Aspergers shutdowns and the information has been sporadic and not entirely helpful.

It was a huge weight lifted off my shoulders at the time, because I thought something must be wrong with ME. Moving forward about 6 weeks, we're getting to a point where it's tough again. He can say things that are very... harsh? And he can be condescending / hurtful without even realizing it.

Can someone give me any suggestions or tips on how to communicate or talk to someone with Aspergers? Or tips for myself on how to understand what he says is not meant to be hurtful?

I was finally diagnosed with Asperger's in 2011. It was a two-year struggle to get the diagnosis. A clinical psychologist said yes, two psychiatrists said no. My clinical psychologist batted for me, the psychiatrists resisted. Wanting to clear the confusion, I went to get a formal assessment done and was told I was ""too complex"" for the assessor to give me an answer, due to my other mental health issues.

Then my psychiatrist suddenly backflipped and said, yes, you do have Asperger's. So now it's officially on my file. 

It's weird, though. Despite having the official diagnosis, I often don't feel like I'm seen as ""aspie"" enough. I've been put into the ""high functioning"" basket, which I guess is flattering? However, it also means people tend to assume that I'm not autistic even when I've told them, and then when I demonstrate autistic behaviours and reactions, I get blamed for being some sort of asshole. 

So I find it really frustrating. Yes, I work [I'm a freelance writer, I get paid to work from home and write]. Yes, I study [currently studying a Master's degree]. I'm also a photographer and have exhibited my work around Australia, and I have a regularly gigging band. So okay, I can accept the ""high functioning"" label. Yet, I feel like I'm judged on those aspects alone, and my Asperger's gets shoved under the carpet. 

I don't even think my psychiatrist, who made the diagnosis, takes it seriously sometimes. He asked me once if I enjoyed ""hurting him"", and that completely baffled me. Or that he wishes I would be more ""emotionally intelligent"". Well, I would like to be more ""emotionally intelligent"" too but considering I was born with an alternative wiring in my brain which impairs that ability, there's a limited amount I can do about it.

I've told various friends and family about my Asperger's diagnosis, and the responses have largely been:

+ ""No you're not"" / ""No way!"" / ""You don't seem autistic."" &lt;&lt; I wish I could get paid $1 for every time someone's said that to me because that would pay for a holiday to Hawaii or Polynesia.
+ ""I've been around a lot of autistic people and you're not like them."" &lt;&lt; Why yes, every autistic person is the same.
+ ""I've always wondered if you realise people have feelings too."" &lt;&lt; hai there, empathy issues due to autism!
+ ""You just think you are autistic."" &lt;&lt; Sometimes I would like to think I'm not, but Jedi mind tricks just don't work. 

I tried going to my city's official autism group and got a really lukewarm reception by the receptionist, so I didn't go back. I asked about adult services and she just gave me a weird look, some brochures and went back to her computer without another word, so I guess I wasn't autistic enough in her eyes. 

Anyone else had those responses? I feel like since I'm not ""aspie"" enough, I don't count. Yet, having to act neurotypical all the time is exhausting and stressful. I don't get any support or help because I'm ""high functioning"", and I'm made to feel like I choose to act autistic when I really don't think I have a choice in the matter.

I'm an Aspie. Surprise, right? 
I've a story to tell, then a question to ask all of you. 

Story on recognizing emotions: 
It's downright difficult to communicate with others for me, especially with emotional topics. Why? It is because I have not only a difficulty with understanding other's emotions, but oftentimes my own as well. Since I was a wee lad still in elementary school, I have had great difficulty with recognizing my own emotions. I would experience an emotion, but I could not recognize which emotion it was. Is this anger? Is this sadness? Is this betrayal? Is this jealousy? The only way I knew how to label an emotion I was feeling was to describe to myself my thought process during the time. From there, I would sort of reverse engineer my thoughts to their emotional foundations. It's a pain in the butt, yet I've learned to endure it quite handily. I am now 22 years old and I still find myself having trouble with recognizing which emotions I experience. I often end up asking my girlfriend to give me a few minutes to determine what emotion I am feeling to continue a conversation or discussion with her. She gladly obliges my request. Bless her for being so patient and understanding with me. I really need to know if there are any others that have this hindrance as well. 

TL;DR I often have trouble recognizing not only other's emotions, but my own as well. 

Question for everyone:
Have/do you ever experience a similar difficulty in recognizing your own emotions? If so, how much has it hindered you when trying to articulate your own emotions to another? 

Feel free to share any experiences you or someone you know have had in as much detail as you want. I find it supremely helpful to be able to relate to others like me. 

Thank you for your time.

But I've had people tell me - numerous times - in numerous situations - that I've been taken advantage of. I never seem to see it.

People will ask me to lend them money. OK, not a problem. Why not?
Or take care of a situation for them that they don't want to deal with. Or they'll dump projects into my lap. I have an overwhelming desire to be helpful that I can't seem to control.

If I see that someone wants or needs something and I can help them get it, I will, even at my own expense, even if they haven't directly asked me.

I feel terrible if I have to tell someone that I can't do something for them. It isn't desperation, so much as a notion that ""this is how I am nice to people"". If I tell someone ""no"", I feel like I've somehow failed them.

I've paid for people to visit family members. I've fixed people's cars, their computers, etc. for free. I've taken on tasks at work I didn't need to, even though I would have been better off focusing on my own projects. 

Generally people are appreciative, and it feels good.
But sometimes, they wind up using me, under the pretense of friendship, and when I come to realize that this has happened, I feel utterly betrayed and furious. 

 I grew up in a family where we valued honor, and I've often found it hard to control my anger when something like this happens.

My responses to some of these situations could best be described as ""disproportionate"".

As I've matured, I've put a lot of checks and balances in place to try to control most of my more unusual impulses and mannerisms, and for the most part I've been successful. But this is one area where I've struggled.

I don't understand why people want to try to take more than they deserve from someone who's already trying to help them, or why they think it's acceptable to attempt to discard them afterwards.

Maybe it can be for someone here.

Quick back-story on me for perspective. I was officially diagnosed a few months ago with Aspergers/High-Functioning Autism after a couple years of self-diagnosing. I struggle with anxiety in so many flavors with the most prominent being social and organizational/executive functioning.  My anxieties became pronounced after getting married and have increased with addition of each of our two kids. 

I started running a little over a year ago because I wasn't happy with my body image and knew that exercise needed to be a part of it. I'd never enjoyed running before, but time is a priority for me. No other exercise requires so little pre and post activity. I can walk out my door and start immediately. 

I'd never taken an extended break in my running schedule that whole time until a few weeks ago when I slightly injured my left knee. Over those next three weeks, I became much more irritable, anxious, depressed, etc. It was incredibly overwhelming, and it wasn't until the end of my break that I realized that I had felt like this before, all the time. Before I started running.

Immediately after I resumed my running schedule, my mood perked back up, I was laughing again, I was having fun with my wife. I am still anxious in all the predictable spots, but they require a much more intense trigger to activate them. I'm just happy I have the motivation to play with my sons again. I'm just happy that I don't feel like I am constantly on the verge of meltdown when I am at home.

Running is a necessity for my sanity just as sure as food and water are necessary to sustain my life. Sleep is also the same way, and I can trigger these same anxieties/depression with a little sleep deprivation.

I'm having trouble googling an exhaustive list of Aspergers commonalities, though, and I'm wondering if any on this list are BS, and what other things might be on the list that aren't. 

* Enjoying metallic tastes (Malts, especially) 
* Preferring full body pressure (piling up pillows on your body while sleeping.) 
* Being unable to hear the person right next to you if there is a lot of background noise.  (Even having the TV on is tough; and even ""quiet"" coffeeshops that play light rock in the background can be distracting for me, though I vastly prefer that to a crowded bar.) 
* Verbose vocabulary (Indeed, it took two years of Journalism school to understand that small words work better than big ones.) 
* Animal Noises (For John Elder Robison, it was a ""Woof!"" - for me, it was a bear-like growl.) 
* Inability to remember faces or names. (Names - huge leak for me.  I sometimes forget the name of my *sister* for God's sake... As for faces, one time, I was actually *actively looking* for a woman I had met the week before.  While I was looking for her, a woman I didn't recognize waved at me.  I assumed that she was waving to a person behind her, so I instinctively looked behind myself.  When I didn't see anyone, I pointed to myself in question, and she nodded.  I squinted.  ""I'm sorry, are you the girl I met here last week?""  ""Yes."" Then it dawned on me.  I was looking for a girl with straight hair.  She had changed it, and now it was curly.  So I didn't recognize her at all!)
* Urge to hide under the desk.  I'm 33 years old, and I *STILL* get this urge, though I've trained myself not to indulge it.  Or at least, not to indulge it with the office door open.  
* Songs stick in my head a lot longer than most people.  
* Twirling leg hair into spikes. 
* Operating on autopilot for navigation. (My company moved offices.  I once ended up driving to my old office building, parking, getting on the elevator, and heading to my old office.  It was only when I didn't see my computer on my desk that I remembered we had moved.  This was a FULL TWO MONTHS after the move. And god help me if I have to go to a destination that is almost, but not quite, identical to a destination I visit frequently. I've often stopped in my favorite cafe and gotten a seat before I remembered that what I really set out to do was visit the bookstore across the street.)
* A key phrase that I keep coming back to for no reason.  Right now, that phrase is ""Theoretical Mean.""  I have NO idea why that phrase.  Other than it just sounds funny, and I like to repeat it.  ""Theoretical Mean.  THEoretical Mean.  TheorETICAL Mean..."" 
* Being able to tell ""tall tales"" - Like John Elder Robison, I can convincingly tell bizarrely plausible but not-really-when-you-think-about-it tales.  I let people off the hook, by telling him I was kidding about that part... Here's the thing, I'm *dead* convincing when I tell them though. So people have a tough time telling when I'm actually kidding. 
* The converse: I have trouble telling when people are joking.  Just the other day, my friend Ryan had me convinced he was on Jeopardy in 2008.  Of course, these two traits have helped me quite a bit in poker - ""Brian, that's a huge bet.  Do you have the nuts (the best possible hand, in poker slang)?"" ""Yes. I've got 98 suited for the nut straight with a backdoor flush draw.""

A couple thoughts were running through my head today. About Aspergers and sexuality. I'm not technically asexual, but I often find myself confused over my interests in others. 

I've loved someone. A girl, yes. At the time she was beautiful. But like most ""love stories"" she wasn't for me. And that's ok. But other times, I've found myself looking at one of my (male) friends and thinking ""holy crap, this guy is amazing in every way"". I literally could not stop thinking about this friend. I desired to be with him, to enjoy my moments laughing and goofing around like the best of friends.

Now, I know I'm not gay. I am attracted to those of the female species. What I'm saying is that sometimes I'll feel the same level of attraction to my friends, for reasons I don't know. When this happens, I don't think it's a ""love"" thing. It is purely a ""friend"" thing.  

But the feelings. They're the same feelings I get when thinking of my obsessions. You know what I mean. The one that fills you with excitement and happiness when you think about that certain obsession (mine being computers). Truly beautiful.

I don't know about you, but this happens a lot to me. I read somewhere that often times, people with Aspergers confuse the feelings of love and obsession. And they tend to obsess over anything. People included. 

I'm starting to rant, so I'll sum up what I'm trying to say. Having AS, I obsess over things. Doesn't matter what or who it is. Male, female, inanimate object, none of that matters when I am so attached to it. 

I guess another (less creepy) way to put it is, I fall in love with a person, not a gender. My friend is an amazing person. I'm not gay, but my obsessions get the better of me and I start to like this person to the point where most NT's would be creeped out.

1372262901.0,22,self.aspergers,1h45ll,Aspergers and pets - I don't want my dogs,35,13,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1h45ll/aspergers_and_pets_i_dont_want_my_dogs/,"How do you feel about pets?
 
I’ve only realized recently that I have Aspergers.  I am trying to find a therapist to start dealing with it but in the meantime, I am starting to realize that some things about my personality may not be just character weaknesses I should fix at all costs.
 
And I think one of my weaknesses is dealing with animals. My siblings had allergies growing up so I didn’t have furry pets growing up. I had brief experiences after that and as an adult I’ve had fish, parakeets, and cats. But about a year ago I had the stupid idea that my kids would be better off with a dog (all kids should have a dog, right?) We now have two. One we adopted from a shelter a year ago and another my partner brought home a few months ago. They’re both mixed breeds, one is lab size and the other one will be. I wanted a small dog like a dachshund, but my partner had large dogs growing up. I’m regretting not standing my ground. 

My sensory issues and OCD is mostly at fault. The worst issue is that I can’t stand the way they smell. I would have to bathe them twice a week and I still don’t like how they smell after a bath. I feel like they’re always dirty. I don’t like being licked or being jumped on. I don’t like hair and mud all over my house and I’m paranoid letting them run free in the house because they have chewed things up. I would have to be paranoid about constantly picking up because everyone leaves toys and stuff out. I don’t like that they bark all the time (because they’re probably bored) and worry the neighbors disapprove about the noise. I don’t like dealing with poop and am tired of constantly fixing things they chew on or break.

The dogs mostly live outside in the back yard in a fenced-off area of the yard and come in to an indoor kennel at night or during rain storms. That’s it. My only interaction with them is taking them out in the mornings or bringing them in the evenings, and that’s only if my partner doesn’t do it. I’ve taken them to dog training classes but walking is still such an ordeal with a heavy dog pulling on the leash that I don’t enjoy the process. My partner works from home and I’ve asked them to walk them during lunch, but they get so wrapped up in work that sometimes they don't even eat. I can’t take them to the parks we like to go to because the oldest one throws up anytime she goes in a car. EVERY TIME.
 
My kids don’t even play with them as much as I envisioned. The 4 year old likes them but they’re always jumping on him and knocking him over so I’m worried leaving them out when he’s around. My 10 year old will play tug-of-war with them once in a while but isn’t strong enough to walk them. And he shows no interest in helping take care of them. Guinea pigs are about the limit of his willingness and that’s only because they’ll squeak when they need something.
  
I can’t talk to my friends about it because I’ve also realized that I think of animals…as animals. I enjoy the AWW subreddit as much as anyone else but at the end of the day, they’re still animals. Not a family member, but an animal. The thought of sleeping with them in my bed is disgusting. I wouldn’t risk my life to save them like I hear about in the news all the time. They’re a friend, but they're an animal, not a human. And all my friends are die-hard dog lovers who agonize over what food to feed them and sleep with them at night. 
 
So I’m at a crossroads. My true gut feeling is I don’t want the dogs. They were a mistake. I’m not attached to them at all. They’re more of a burden than a companion. But I feel like such a horrible person for not wanting them after adopting them. I even did a Google search to see if anyone else felt the way I did and got nothing but people ranting about anyone who gives up animals. I can’t talk to my closest friends about it and I’m afraid that I’m going to lose them over this because I doubt they'll understand.

I’m not looking to give the dogs up to a shelter. I will advertise and find them a home. I love them enough to want them to have a better life, with people who don’t see them as a burden. I just don’t want to turn into a person who confines and yells at them all the time. 
 
And I vow to never adopt an animal larger than a cat and not for a very long time. I know my limits now and I'm understanding myself better every day. I can deal with the guinea pigs. I am open to fish or parakeets again. But I won’t adopt something that I've never had before and not unless one of the kids is taking care of it. They can play with dogs at other people’s houses.
 
But I still feel like a horrid horrid person.
 
My partner is away on business until next week so I’m trying to figure out how to broach the subject. If he’s willing to step up and walk them, bathe them weekly and help me minimize the sensory issues I’ll give it another shot, but otherwise I just do not need this extra stress in my life. Yes I made a mistake but I don't see suffering through this for a decade. They're animals, not children.
 
This will probably be downvoted to oblivion, which is why I created this throwaway account for this. Any opinions or comments are welcome, even negative, as long as they're respectful.
 
tldr; I recently found I have Aspergers. Due to sensory issues I have realized I don't want my large dogs any more because of sensory issues. I'm feeling horrible guilt as a result.
 
EDIT - Thank you for all of the responses. I think what it comes down to is that I see owning pets/dogs as normal and something that I should be able to handle. I wanted my children to have the whole Lassie/Benji experience and it has fallen flat. I need to stop trying being somebody that I'm not. Several discussions have been had about the dogs and my issues with them and although I'm thinking we are going to find them new homes at this point, it's not final yet.

Basically for as long as I can remember I've felt sort of empty, like as if the emotional variance or capacity for others was say ten, and I was running on a solid two. I didn't mind, it seemed like really I just had an easier time than others; I never had to worry about such common afflictions as social anxiety, or guilt. This seemed favourable despite the fact that as well as evading the natural troughs of emotion, I was also missing out on the natural crests of life; there was simply less capacity for these things. I can't remember ever feeling like I was happy, but I don't feel like I've ever been very unhappy either. I just remain, neutral and impassive.

Some of my attitudes to these things have changed much in the past three months or so. I've been taking, for the first time, a lot of psychedelic drugs. LSD, in particular, has given me some strange dispositions. I feel like those things, feelings, are important to me, for the first time ever. I want to feel. I want to have emotion. But I don't. And it seems like there's nothing I can do about it. Now when I'm at some party and have to listen to someone I still feel a relentless apathy towards them, I just feel disgusted at myself for feeling that way, and wish for nothing more than to care.

If there is anyone else that has felt these things I would really appreciate hearing about it, I don't know anyone else with AS and think someone relatable would be a big help for me at this time.

EDIT: I pretty much dislike myself for saying this, but I feel desperate. Please, if anyone else feels like me or can offer any advice, please help me.

So in my quest to understand Aspergers, I started looking at it through an Anthropological lens. Aspies really do have a very specific sub culture (with variation, of course) and, of course, behavior. 

So I started asking some questions I would ask about different cultures and then I came upon the subject/concept of Ownership. 

Now, ever since I've come to this community I've had the very sneaky and overwhelming feeling that I may have Aspergers too. But at the moment, I remain undiagnosed. However, it didn't stop me from thinking about a particular habit of mine that I just can't quit. 

When it comes to ownership, despite what people tell me, I can't take from them. For nearly seven years, my best friend's mom would tell me every day that if I wanted food, I could just go into the pantry and get it myself. For seven years, I never once did that. I tried to, once, but had to reassure myself that it was ok to take that particular food item by asking my friend multiple times if she wasn't going to eat it. ever. 

It goes further. I can't even grab things out of my own mother's pantry. It was one of the things that kept me from baking and cooking for so long. What if she needed the sugar for something she was planning to bake? What if I used too much flour? So I didn't. I made distinct decisions about which foods belonged to everyone else and which ones belonged to me. Like popcorn. I got very possessive about popcorn. lol. 

And it isn't just a food thing. I have a very hard time accepting gifts. I have a very hard time borrowing things from anyone. As a woman, men don't get just how badly I can't handle taking from them. It just feels so wrong. 

And then, of course, I can't handle people messing with my own things. I can't even take someone touching them, sometimes.

I asked him what he meant but he couldn't really explain.

I suspect he was just stigmatizing other workmate's autism because he doesn't get on with him, and doesn't know that I'm in the process of being diagnosed aspie and therefore wanted to chew him out for being a prick to people with ASD. My code is FLAWLESS yo, don't try and pin $negative_thing on ASD mister colleague bitch.

But it did make me think about it. If people with autism are meant to be better at recognizing patterns and are 'detail-oriented' (also able to focus on stuff for hours at a time in the right setting), what effect does that have on the code they write? Is there actually a recognizable difference between ""neurotypical code"" and ""autie code""?

The biggest stressor in my life has always been school. Having to shape a sleep schedule around it, having to be there for so many hours a week, unwanted social contact. The whole institution really disturbs me in the sense that it's a set of rules which highly inconvenience and upset me and which I have absolutely *no* say against whatsoever. There is no flexibility, no spontaneity.

I have always refused to shape myself around the expectations of such institutions. I don't think I'm even able.

I feel that stable employment would work the same way, with the exception that there would at least be a degree of flexibility.

Even so, I have never been able to visualize myself in any place of work with normal hours.

On the other hand, I absolutely love the idea of freelance employment. I hardly even let myself think about it, though, due to an ingrained guilt from my years in school (If it's not painful, it's not good etc.).

I have never taken a chance in my life, and hardly ever even taken any real actions (going out for fun, doing anything with money -- hardly a thousand dollars has changed hands with me in my life, and that mostly in the past year with my projects). But, I want to take a risk now, move to another state, and take up freelance work. I'd finish a college degree first or continue working on it after the move.

These past couple of years have been great fun for me. I've taken up a piano restoration project, and to raise money for it, I've been restoring and reselling vintage tools. There's nothing like the feeling of satisfaction of my own work my own way.

1347625238.0,24,self.aspergers,zvfxx,People: a sum of patterns,28,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/zvfxx/people_a_sum_of_patterns/,"I have come to realize within the last few years how I analyze people.  Since I was very young, I had a very difficult time ""reading people"".  This would usually land me in difficult places (befriending the wrong people or simply not making hardly any friends because of this process).

Here is how I figure out someone:

NT's have this *intuition* about other NT's.  They know fairly quickly whether a person is someone they want to be around or befriend.  I do NOT possess that ability no matter how hard I tried and no matter how often I tried to convince myself that I did (many failed interactions proved this).

I have to find a person's *pattern* before I can determine if that person is suitable to have any sort of relationship with (friendship, etc).  It's a behavior/lifestyle pattern that I have to find and learn.  

This takes time and a lot of observation on my part. It can take months, and some times years. As you can imagine, I don't have many actual friends as a result.  The screening process simply takes too damn long, and people's patience runs out long before they get through it.

However, once someone has made it through the process with me and I have determined that they are suitable...they are a true friend...and a friend for life.

After years of failed friendships and many many times of being taken advantage of (even raped once) because I didn't understand that I needed to find there pattern FIRST...I've finally settled on this is how my friend making process has to work.  

For example, when I had let someone come to my house only weeks after meeting them...I had no clue as to who they were (as a person)...I won't make that mistake again.  But, my gf later on who had met him at that time says, ""You couldn't tell that he was only after you sexually?"" I was like, ""WHAT?! NO!  I'm gay and he KNOWS I'm gay...why would he think he had a chance with me that way???""  She said (she's NT), ""I could see it in his eyes!"".  I was like HUH!? I had absolutely NO IDEA. This blindsided me, and was the final situation to make me FINALLY understand that I had to complete this process with people of there pattern so that hopefully I'm never hurt again.  :/

Another example: I used to either open up to someone entirely too soon in a friendship and they think I'm weird for sharing personal or TMI type of stuff too soon, or I would never open up at all and they think I'm weird and back off. It was usually the former, and it would get me in a trouble because too many people would know too much about me and then gossip about it. :/

Anyhow, I put everyone through the process first now that I finally understand this.

TL/DR of that, history, material culture, and museums are my passion.

So, I mentioned getting called into a meeting with the director, and the whole thing was me faking feeling confident.  Oh how I was faking it... And of course I walked away disappointed with myself for not being able to articulate my thoughts as well as I'd hoped.  I had prepared for hours the day before and rehearsed everything I could think of, and it did really help, but a few of her comments still threw me off and I had trouble getting my thoughts back after that. The long and short of the meeting was I was competing with two other applicants for the last slot in the class.  I originally didn't get it, and it took a lot of effort not to get down on myself for that.  But about two months ago someone dropped out and I got in!  

Today the director sent out a basic information sheet with the books we need and our first assignment (because we apparently have summer homework).  I don't even care that this just added another paper to my summer work load.  I'm so excited!!  I have a free (well, tuition covered it...) ticket to go to a museum I haven't been to since I was 12, and I get to write a paper on it... Yes to that!!

So I just wanted to share that with everyone.  I'm going to be dancing in my room for a while.  I'm so excited!!

We always suspected my daughter had Aspergers, and as she grew a bit older (she's now 12), we openly discussed it with her, but left it to her decision if she wanted to go to a doctor.

As her father, I would categorize her as being a very ""mild"" aspie, as many behaviors just don't seem to be present.    She maintains eye contact, she's relatively social with people she knows, she doesn't appear to have any overwhelming interests in particular subjects.

She does have social challanges, and has been bullied.  She's very clumsy / can't ride a bike.  She perfers to be by herself, reads voraciously, and has always had a great vocabulary.  She can't hold a tune or  beat, and prefers the company of adults, but has been getting much better lately with kids her own age.

Yet, the doctor's report calls out and emphasizes many things that I don't see - the eye contact, the overhelming interest in specific topics, etc.   I feel the report makes her appear to be quite a ways down the spectrum, and not the ""mild"" level that my wife and I have always assumed.

Do other NTs with aspie family members experience the same thing and have difficulty noticing the behaviors?   Or is it possible that the doctor just cut 'n pasted traditional aspie behaviors into the report?

Basically, my mom watched the autism special on *The Nature of Things* and got it into her head that Acidophilus would cure my Aspergers.

So, I basically told her that I wasn't comfortable with taking it, that there is no way to cure autism, no matter what fucking David Suzuki says, and that I find it incredibly insulting that she would try to force this on me without even asking me my opinion or even doing any actual research. She has, for the time being, reluctantly backed down; I think she's still stuck on on the whole ""it was in a documentary, so it must be true"" mentality.

She hasn't dropped the issue altogether though. She's changed her tone a bit; now she says she just wants me to take it to help with some of my ""digestive issues"" which I've never had in my entire life...good thinking, mom. She'll bring it up from time to time (eg. *While watching an Activia commercial* Mom: Look, barrageobad, that yogurt has probiotics in it, which is exactly what Acidophilus is! Me: Yeah Mom, what a coincidence...)

I don't want it to sound like my mom is some kind of monster, because I know that she loves me and just wants what's best for me. Critical thinking has just never been one of her strengths, to say the least. Reading through your guys' comments on the last thread made me feel kind of guilty, because I love her and I feel like I'm setting her up as a pig for slaughter. Some of the things she does may be kind of stupid, but her heart is definitely in the right place. Trust me.

Thank you all for your support and advice. This is probably my favorite subreddit and it's so refreshing to be able to discuss issues like this with people who truly understand what I go through every day. And I'm sorry for the late update!

I have spent a secret lifetime being critical and judging myself for all of this strange shit that I DO and that I AM and finding myself wanting and ""less-than"" and sexually different and odd and just. not. normal. ever and I've learned to cope and to pretend and to deny and be secretive and FIT IN and it's worked! and I'm happy! but I've always thought I was OFF and WRONG and now, now! with this diagnosis I'm coming to the realization that, hey! there's nothing WRONG with me, I'm not ""all fucked up"", a weirdo or anything, I just have ASPERGERS, I have this THING! that makes me this way, and it's not ME, I'm just wired this way and omygod I just feel this huge sense of RELIEF, like waves of relief, and I recognize myself me CLOVERNN in these articles I'm reading and tests I'm taking and here, in this subreddit, it's like a whole group of people like ME and oh hell I know this is just a huge run-on crazy sentence but I just want to write it all out and throw it here as a post and just say wow! and Holy SHIT! and tell all of you guys how I just feel . . .

She suggested I am stuck in parallel play, the stage of play children begin at about 2 to 2.5 years of age and end by potty training time. ""Parallel play"" or ""parallel activity"" is basically (copied from my blog) "" . . . a form of play in which each child engages in an independent activity that is similar to but not influenced by or shared with the others."" For example, as an adult, preferring to sit with friends while they are on their respective computers not engaging in the same activity yet sitting in close proximity, or traveling/exploring, or hiking, or reading with friends but not necessarily engaging in major conversation face-to-face with them or cooperating.

I'm a 21 year old female with AS, I live away from my parental home as a University student. I'm in a relationship with a 19 year old NT, though he's one of few people who understand me and the way I think. He does think very similarly to me, which is why we get along quite well.

I've noticed recently, with my 21st birthday passing yesterday, that I am a lot different from my family. Whilst they wanted me to go out and drink with them for my 21st birthday because ""it's a big thing"", I was leaning more towards just laying back and relaxing, watching films or playing video games with my boyfriend. 

I was happy to go for a meal with my family to celebrate, and was incredibly grateful they did that, although the idea of going out drinking completely shook me (it was also a plan she threw at me mere hours before she had planned for it to occur), and it completely baffled my mum as to why I wanted to ""waste"" my 21st birthday like that, as ""I'm only 21 once"", as she had always said to me whilst I was growing up.

Since yesterday, I've been confused and slightly distressed over the fact that I feel as if my family don't understand me, and that there are very few who do understand me as a person. It led me to wonder, why should I be judged negatively for the way in which I want to spend my birthday? Why don't they understand that I am who I am?

1366894911.0,23,self.aspergers,1d2vt0,I'm a 20 year old aspie and I am looking for alternatives to hurting myself when I can't control my emotions,26,3,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1d2vt0/im_a_20_year_old_aspie_and_i_am_looking_for/,"I am a 20 year old man with asperger's. When I was a child I would 'head bang' when I was upset, but after a while I stopped doing this. I had a lot of therapy from about age 4 to age 14. My mother has always been very understanding and supportive, and I have to admit that I was quite dependent on her for a long time.

When I was 18, I left home for university. Since that time (since my mother is never around to see it), when I get upset or angry or frustrated, I often hurt myself by either punching a wall as hard as I can, or bashing my head on something hard (wall/desk/book/fist etc.). Often this calms me down, but I have hurt myself quite badly in the process a few times.

Most people don't know about this as I usually only do it when I'm alone, but sometimes people ask what happened to my hands (I say I accidentally scraped them on a wall), and my girlfriend has seen me bash my head on things (but she said she will break up with me if I do it, so I make sure not to do it in front of her).

Some less dangerous alternatives have helped, though:

* Sometimes listening to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvCbzfieLLA) over and over again has calmed me down

* Sometimes I scream/roar and it helps (but I try not to do this as people find it strange)

* If I get upset whilst walking somewhere, sometimes I run very fast for a while and feel better afterwards

* I have been a bit obsessed with numbers and counting my whole life, and sometimes counting in primes or other interesting sequences distracts me into feeling better

The problem is that I am often not in a position to do these things. I am not usually in a position to hide away listening to angry songs for half an hour, and unless I am in my room people will hear me roaring. Unless I am walking somewhere already, I find it very difficult to motivate myself to go for a run when I am feeling very emotional. Counting I can do, but is the least effective option in the list. However, I can usually find a wall to punch or a desk to bash my head on discreetly.

1362340744.0,24,self.aspergers,19lazk,"Hi. There is a stereotype that Aspies are rude. I am not, but I'd like to learn how to be. ",26,2,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/19lazk/hi_there_is_a_stereotype_that_aspies_are_rude_i/,"I understand that this is quite a bizarre request, but I believe that every person needs 'meaness' to happen to them in order to grow as a person. However, I was never taught how to be mean or how to plan a conversation that involves rudeness. My default in unfamiliar social situations is absolute politeness. I have that situation rehearsed. I know all possible outcomes. I understand it. 

But sometimes I just feel like things would be better if I had been a little bit mean to the person I was interacting with. Like I need to stand my ground or let them know their behavior isn't okay in a way that they understand. So, rudeness is actually the appropriate tool in certain situations. 

Examples:

1. I was at the grocery store and the cashier decided to bag all of my groceries in one comically large bag. I politely informed her I was walking, but her reaction was to look blankly at me. So I said thank you very much have a nice day, and I left. I walked 5 blocks home with ~15 lbs of groceries in a ripping plastic bag big enough to fit multiple 3 year-olds inside of. It was horrible and it could have been avoided if I could have let the cashier know this wasn't okay in a way she understood. 

2. My mom only talks to me when she wants money from me. I always tell her in detail my exact financial situation, but she still keeps persisting. I want to tell her to fuck off. She should be supporting me, but I don't know how to predict that conversation well enough to have it in reality. So, she wins. She gets me to agree to lending her money that I know I'll never get back, and I do it all while being polite because that's really all I know. 

I talked to the leader of the social skills group at the MIND institute, and she seemed to think that no harm can ever come from being too polite. That's just not realistic. How do you know when you've fucked up if no one is ever mean to you?  People where constantly mean to me when I was growing up, and it was a great help in my attempts to shape my behavior to fit societal norms. If people get that same level of meaness then they too can shape their behavior. 

I don't know, those are just all of my reasons why I believe I should learn to be mean. I just don't know how to plan a scripted conversation where I'm the mean one. 


How do you handled preparing for an interaction where you know you have to be mean? How do people normally react? What tricks do you use to display meaness to the other person? Any other helpful advice or tips? 


EDIT: Note that being assertive take a bit of ""meaness"" to do it right. If you're going to tell me to be assertive keep in mind that I still don't know how to do that.  And also, note that in extreme situations where a person hurts you, being outright mean is the thing you should do. So, skipping over the ""how to be mean"" aspect isn't all that useful. I think I can figure out with some practice how much ""meaness"" to use an when.

So often when I read about Aspergers and reactions to tight situations, the common thing tends to be people going ballistic and smashing things, disappearing for a few days etc...

I'm utterly not like this though, to something of an extreme in the other direction. I'm pretty much a doormat in my (currently on hold) marriage, and it's a real issue.

I have pretty low confidence in myself, and am very bad at arguing a point. I also hate being wrong. I think these things conspire to men that I can't / won't argue, refuse to not try to see my wifes perspective, and then pretty much invariably end up agreeing with it, to either get out of the situation of because I just plain can not disprove her point or put forward my own.

And so this situation over the years has reinforced itself. The more I back down and say I'm wrong, the more she believes her own positions without apparently questioning them. And she gets so angry so quickly, and I get pathetic, which makes her even angrier!

If I was someone else I can imagine i wouldn't stand for all sorts of things, just because I didn't want to. Even if I WAS wrong, I wouldn't always care etc... But I fundamentally care about everything so much I don't want to offend or be incorrect. So I get walked all over. 

As an example of the broad state of affairs, I'm currently separated from my wife and have been financially supporting her 100% for 9 months now, paying her a monthly child support sum that is actually greater than the national average salary of my country. Despite this I still went and paid for her annual car insurance today, on a car I bought her when I knew she was going to leave me... The area she lives in even added 50% to the premium... and I still smile and pay in the hope she'll move back in to our home... I appear to be a spineless fool.

Does this sound at all familiar to the AS community here? I feel that the anxiety and dread I feel when in these situations is probably related to my traits in general.

It connects.. The dots, they just connect.. 
I'll give you as an example, people normally take steps in their head, to go from say 1 to 5..
They go: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
And it makes sense, of course it does.. I go from 1 to 5.. Immediately.. With perhaps a fraction of a thought going to 3.
Because the knowledge is there, my mind, without even realising it, makes the connection. 
It is incredibly hard to explain, even sitting behind my laptop, having all the time in the world to type it out.

And I forget this sometimes.. Making it hard for me to understand why some people are ""slow"". 
It gets quite frustrating too, especially when people try to explain things to me, step by step, when I've already made the full connection in my head.


Now here's a bit of a backstory:
I've been living in Australia for almost a year now and in a few weeks it is time for me to leave. While I was here I found out that it is very, very likely I have a mild form of Aspergers. I will get myself checked once I get home, but the more I read about it, the more likely it seems. My dad has been working with people with Autism for quite a while now and he says that he started recognising it a few years ago. He talked it over with my mum and a social worker I/my family were in contact with at the time and they all agreed. Although I've had some good conversations with some people that I've met here in OZ, I've had to deal with this on my own and I'm very happy to have found this subreddit and see that so many people are dealing with the same issues I'm dealing with. 


I guess I'd like to end this post with saying thank you all for sharing your everyday problems and difficulties, because it let's me know that even though I sometimes feel alone and distanced, there are others out there who are in the same crazy-feeling little boat..

Months later, after hearing a game soundtrack, I redid my music collection and filled my life with the power of song once again.

END OF TLDR

I don't know about other Aspies, but I learned today that I absolutely need music in my life. 

For the longest time I was in denial. I wanted to hear the sweet sound of song, but I couldn't make myself do it. It's complicated to explain. I guess over time as I overheard some of the stupid music styles today, and saw how people actually listened to it (I understand it's an opinion thing, but honestly most of the ""hits"" out there are absolute garbage). 

Anyway, I eventually started to repulse music. I began to see it as degraded crap that the masses devour. Nicki Minaj, Lil'Wayne, etc (my apologies to any fans of those people). In my blind haste, I started to forget about the other side of the fence. The better side, where the music actually matters to musicians, and lyrics were semi-intelligent.

I deleted my entire library, vowing never to listen to such garbage again. I thought I could live without music. Most of it was crap anyway, I thought I would be better off. But after a few months, I was looking at things differently. No longer seeing things in rose-colored glasses. Without the beautiful sensation of song, my world became dull. Blank. Grey. Boring.

I was really bitter. I noticed it, so did others. But it wasn't until I opened Minecraft today and everything changed. In the game I found a music disc. I took it home and had a listen. It changed me. 

The song was by C418, the soundtrack creator for Minecraft. It was the most inspiring tune I had ever heard. I immediately went to iTunes and checked out all of his works. Sure enough, this inspired me to fill my library again with new, better music. I discovered new artists, and new albums. 

I can practically feel the changes. I feel so much happier with some ""color"" in my life. Music really is food for the soul.

Anyways...just some random opinions. What do you guys think about all these characters with Asperger's in TV? There are surprising a lot of them. I think it makes for really interesting characters. Usually in sitcoms like this all the characters are quirky. There's a really great speech about small talk from Community I need to upload because I think you guys would like it...

To my surprise heaps of people came up with ideas.

I've been thinking about it ever since and I still can't come up with an idea. It bugs me.

It also affects my social life. I'm generally dead silent in social situations mainly cause I have nothing to say. It takes me forever to think of something to say.

Is there a way to become more creative? Or is creativity a fixed trait?

For the past 4 months, I have been seeing a new therapist to help me work on my depression and my Aspergers. So far, we have gotten my depression under control and now we are working on what is for me, (and so I have heard many with AS) is a major problem and so far the largest impediment to my success; focus &amp; follow up.

In the past month I have been doing poorly at school and have not found a new job (my prior internship ended on 3 March on good terms). Because of the relatively poor direction my life is taking, my mother thought it would be wise to reach out to my therapist in order to help me work on those two issues. The therapist told her that we would try upping the dosage of the ADHD medicine, but not to expect much because ""That's Aspergers, and we really can't do much about it."" He also suggested that we (myself, my mother, him, and his assistant) should ""Try to get your son on disability.""

I honestly don't know weather to be more enraged, upset, or disappointed. To think that a professional doctor in the heart of New York City would be so defeatist stuns me. It is common knowledge that people with AS can hold very good jobs, do well in school and so much more, and that he would just dismiss me is so wrong. Making matters worse is that he and I have only met once (normally I deal with his assistant), and during that time he kept checking his watch frequently. 

I end this post with a couple of questions.

1) Does anyone else on this subreddit have difficulty with focus and followup? If so, how have you managed to overcome this?

2) Are the beliefs held by my former therapist common?

3) Does anyone have any recommendations for a psychologist/psychiatrist/neurologist in New York City who has expertise in Aspergers/Depression/Family issues?

I had the opportunity to ask my college professor about this. She does a lot of research in the fields of oxytocin and also autism. She said the following things:

Oxytocin can certainly help with perceiving social cues. You start to pay more attention to the eye region, so you get better at mind reading. It also downregulates the amygdala so anxiety decreases. It also has a positive feedback loop, which means you will feel good when interacting socially

However, there are some concerns:
1) Side effects like headaches, but it can also cause abortions.
2) Long-term effects have yet to be studied, especially on developing children
3) You have to increase your dose every time because you develop a tolerance (this has something to do with the double function of oxytocin as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter)

She did say that it could be used as a short term intervention when teaching aspies social things. You learn things quicker due to the reward system and the reduced anxiety, and it also makes you remember social things better.

A place where intense concentration provides the ability to cultivate valuable skills such as programming, a means to shape and control the world we live in.

Thanks for reading.

So, I was just diagnosed last summer. I struggled in college, so i came home so I could re-gather myself before transferring. I kind of shrugged off the diagnosis and didn’t really think much of it  until I got into a relationship with my current boyfriend. I never realized how much AS impacted my life until I had to get really emotionally close with someone who wasn’t just a friend.  He’s honestly really, really great and even though it’s really early on in our relationship, I feel lucky to have someone who will sit and listen to what I say without judgment, even when it doesn’t make sense most of the time (I can never find the words to describe what I’m thinking, so my thoughts sometimes come out all jumbled). 

Here’s the issue: he’s a really social guy. He has a lot of friends and very personable even with strangers. It’s like he can make friends anywhere. I, on the other hand, and a bit of a recluse. I have about 3-4 really close friends from college that I talk to regularly, but none of them are really in the area, so I don’t have to many friends where I live. I can never really make that sort of connection with anyone else, and it’s frustrating because I feel like I’m generally a nice, laid back person.

So, when we hang out with his friends, it’s really great because they’re all really nice, but it can also be exhausting. I am literally thinking about every social thing there is to think about, like, what should I be saying to this person, how do i enter this conversation like a “normal person”; and then since I’m thinking so much it becomes, “oh god you’ve been silent for too long, say something” and then the pressure’s on. ugh. I’m usually okay when there’s just a few people and we’re in a familiar place like his apartment. I might sit in his room for a couple seconds every now and then to chill out. 

Last night was different, though. Keep in mind that all of this was exacerbated because I smoked weed that night, and it made me more anxious and way more introspective than I usually am. We went with his friends, only one of whom I had met before, and they were all really nice and cool. During the movie, the power went out so, we left the theater early. I started to get that uneasy feeling when we were going to his friend’s house. I’m always a tad uncomfortable when I’m in an area that I’m not completely familiar with (and it was nighttime), but usually I can get over it (google maps). It was like, so many plans were changing and I had to re-adjust my mind for all of the unexpected, but for the time being I was in a house and things were static. Then everyone wanted to go to a bowling alley,and I was done at that point (mentally tired, going so many places with people I didn’t know and feeling like I had no idea what was going on), but I stayed for a little while longer. Then it started to get really windy outside, and it was supposed to storm. So, as we start to make our way to the bowling alley, it starts pouring rain, like someone just dropped a bucket of water on us. Now, not only am I socially overwhelmed, I’m feel physically uncomfortable too, which is always horrible combination for me (sensory overload). I just felt went and gross and weighed down. I honestly just wanted to shut down right there and cry it out.

 Then (even after I told everyone I wasn’t 21 yet), he and his friends were sitting at the bar when I got out the bathroom, and I have this weird fear of getting in trouble, specifically the interaction that would have to take place between me and the bartender about sitting at the bar. So, of course, asked for an ID, and I lied and said I didn’t have one on me, so I just left really feeling kinda shitty at this point. I guess crying is like my meltdown, but it always looks like I’m just weird and over-emotional. It really is just me letting all the frustration out. I don’t cry because I’m sad, it’s just that crying is like a meditation for me when I feel overwhelmed. But I didn’t want to freak out my boyfriend, who was doing the best he could with what I was giving him. My bf was really trying to comfort me and was out in the pouring rain trying to hail a cab for me.  If i remember correctly, I think I just kind of gave of the vibe that I was annoyed with him, but it wasn't him at all, I was just overloaded with all the little things.  I just hate that when he asks me what’s wrong, I most of the time can never exactly pinpoint what emotion I’m feeling (I’ve heard of this being called alexithymia) , and I can’t talk because I don’t know what to say because I’m just overloaded at that point, and it’s like I’m mute. 

I just wish I could explain it to him or have him read this without thinking I have a serious problem. Sometimes I think, “wow, he’s not going to want to deal with this, and he thinks I’m crazy.” It’s not a serious problem for me, it’s just that sometimes, in the wrong situations, I can get really overwhelmed and uncomfortable. Not all the time, just sometimes when things get really unfamiliar. But I also don’t want him to feel like this is a problem that he has to take on as his own. It’s not his burden and I don’t want it to be. It’s just that,sometimes, in really unfamiliar situations, I don’t feel like myself, and I feel like I can’t act like myself because all these other little things are running through my mind. I just need better coping strategies, because it’s obvious that, being his girlfriend, I’m gonna be thrown in a lot of his social activities. 

Overall, I’m glad he’s a really patient guy even when I can’t explain what’s going on, but I need a way to tell him. I express myself better through writing, so is it better to write something for him to read? Should I show him this, or would it be weird considering we've only know each other a couple months?

Sorry for the throwaway, but, well, sex talk and all and I'm a bit embarrassed.  I thought for a long time that I was asexual, because I don't really find the human body ""sexy"" and most ""sexy"" things just seem comical to me.  Absolutely zero sex drive until I was in my early 20s and now (almost 30, female) I have a long term boyfriend and as much as I do enjoy sex I don't find the visual lead up at all ""sexy"".  For me, anything ""sexy"" is entirely physical.  It's been hard to explain that visually I do not find the human body sexy, male or female.

So, the complication is that we're long distance, and I we've been having trouble maintaining a good long distance relationship, so I did some research to see what we were missing.  One suggestion that pops up everywhere is cyber sex... which I'm not against (I made the suggestion), I just don't get it.  We've had awkward moments where he's trying to be ""sexy"" and I don't get it, or I'm trying to be ""sexy"" and he doesn't get it.  We end up laughing at each other, which I think is great that we can laugh at each other and be okay about it, but it kills the mood.

So, we did a google image search together, and he said that mostly clothed is ""sexy"" and that it's the lead up.  Then he sent me a link to /r/gonewild and said that maybe it would help me with some other ideas of what he finds ""sexy"". Most of those leave me just confused... and he's at a complete loss as to how to explain this to me, so I was hoping to get some insight from people who maybe have a similar thought process?

So I guess I have two questions.  One is seeking for reassurance.  I know to my boyfriend, and probably to most NTs, this is a side of me that's weird.  I'm okay with that on most levels, but on my insecure days it makes me sad that I'm still ""weird"" to someone I really love and I know loves me.  So I'm wondering if any of you (guys or gals) feel the same about sexual images as I do.  (For me, finding any pleasure in porn is a real effort, and I still don't really get it...)  Also, if you have any suggestions on how to approach cybersex or even just ""sexy"" pictures without feeling completely ridiculous, or feeling ridiculous and just knowing that the other person thinks its something other than ridiculous, that would be really helpful too.  I'm not at all against this - I'm the one who suggested it, but after trying even a little bit today... it was really just horribly awkward... 

Even not talking long distance, since we also have this problem when we're physically together, I understand what he finds physically ""sexy,"" but there are very few things I find ""sexy"" and I feel like a complete fool doing all but a very few forms of foreplay (that I've gotten used to since we started).  So even if you have this experience not in terms of long distance cyber sex but know what I'm talking about in a physical sense, I would like to hear your experiences/thoughts/ideas.

Sorry this turned into a short novel.  I really appreciate any thoughts.  And I'm sorry if this is inappropriate...

Although for me, it hardly took that long. It made sense, it validated a good number of things, and I had no trouble adding it as another data point in my life.

It seems like that's a minority case. I work as a career counselor specializing in Asperger's, and personally know hundreds of individuals on the spectrum through this. It's great to work with the people who come into my office on their own. But what surprises me are how many come in at age thirty, often followed by an anxious parent, and having, seemingly, not yet come into the idea that they are real, adult humans with any adult responsibilities.

I realize that many 20-somethings are this way; and I also realize that it's common to refuse to accept any diagnosis. What I'm trying to find out is the impetus behind nearly half of the people I know on the spectrum will dispute it with such great anger. That's not something I encounter like this with any other diagnosis short of cancer.

When someone isn't there to do his work for him, he simply lets it go; not because he has better things to do, or even a hobby he'd like to enjoy, but rather to complain about how hard things are. 

He likes this quote from The Simpsons that seems apt. ""I've tried nothin', and I'm all out of ideas."" It describes the situation pretty well. Most of our conversations have devolved into his bitterness over not having work or friends, though he refuses any avenue to do so with a highly specific reason why it won't work. On the off-chance it has to do with autism, such as a support group I enjoy going to, he only refuses to respond.

 I suppose I'm worried and I'd like to help, without ~helping~ so much. I don't think it's fair for anyone involved to have to care for a large child, still content to consume without contributing.

It isn't nearly so personal when it's a client, of which I have dozens who do this; they probably won't make any progress until they change their minds, which I've yet to ever see happen. It seems to be a uniquely an autistic thing. It's not one of my autistic things and I have no usable data from which to draw forth an argument.

I literally go days without talking to anyone. I've never had a real friend in my life and most of my interests aren't things other people my age would like, or they are considered 'boys only' and thus social unacceptable for me to like. The few jobs I've had were absolute hell for me and while I feel terrible 'mooching off the system' I just can't function in a work environment properly. 

I can never get over the feeling that I'm just a bother to everyone, that I'm better off just keeping to myself because nobody wants me around anyway. I feel like I should be apologizing to people for my shortcomings. My thought process tends to be, 'This person obviously doesn't want to deal with me. I'm sorry, man, I don't want to be here either.'. I just end up feeling bad that someone's gotta put up with me for an indeterminate amount of time. I try to act as socially normal as possible but there are just somethings about me that I can't change. It doesn't help that my parents seem so much happier around me now now that I've moved out and am not pissing them off all the time. Or that all my teachers were putting on that fake niceness crap but it was obvious that they had no love for me outside of a paycheck. Or all those asshole girls in school who would pretend to be my friend just to get me to do stupid shit for them so that they could laugh when my back was turned. 

It doesn't help either that I'm automatically bad at everything I do. No autistic super genius here. I recently had to get some tests done and apparently I've got a lower than average IQ. I'm stuck with two left feet and probably the award for the most klutzy person alive.

I've pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I've always been alone and will always be alone. It depresses me to no end that there will never be another person who understands me and would put op with my issues. I'm not one of those types that have no empathy either, I have tons of empathy for the things that happen to people so I'm not a grade A jerk, I'm mostly just a doormat. I don't 'click' with anyone. It doesn't help that I'm always talked down to. I don't think I've ever been talked to like an equal. People who know about my disability talk to me like I'm a child and people who don't think I'm so strange that they talked down to me like a subhuman too. It doesn't help that genetics decided to fuck me over even more. Not only am I stupid, ugly, socially stunted, and hopelessly clumsy, I'm also so goddamn short that I look like a middle schooler. This only helps with the whole 'talking down to you' syndrome because I look like someone who's barely even a teen. I always have to crack out my ID because absolutely no one believes me when I tell them my age.

And before I get some comment saying 'oh you need to change because you're obviously a rude and very mean person.' don't give me that shit. I'd probably be doing better if I actually gained some courage and stopped being such a doormat. I go out of my way to be as nice as possible even if I'm pissed off with whoever I'm talking to. I don't like conflict and I prefer to be nice. I'm not a jackass, just super shy and a bit slow at times. Goddamn do I just wish there was someone out there who'd like me for who I am and not constantly telling me that I need to be someone else to fit with their standers.

Of course, this just made things worse, as people realized they could upset me so easily, and it just spun out of control starting in 5th grade and especially in 6th grade (and to lesser levels for some years thereafter). 

I'm 31 now, and what I went through doesn't bother me on a daily basis, but it'll come back up sometimes. It seems amazingly silly that crap that happened when I was 11 or 12 would still bother me at times at age 31, but I had no real way to cope with any of it at all either. 

Like I said, for the most part it doesn't affect my daily life and I don't think much of it anymore. However, I remember what I went through and the horror and paranoia I felt, and I match the symptoms of PTSD -- flashbacks, guilt over it all, a difficult time concentrating (though that one may be due to the Asperger's), staying away from ""reminders"".

one of the worse instance of this (in terms of how much it upset) was at a school sports day when I was 13. I got into a conversation with a girl on a deck chair and eventually sat down on empty one next to her as the minutes passed. a teacher came up to me and said I had to move off the chair

However, I've run into a few personal issues with both the diagnosis and the definition of Aspergers, both as it relates to me, and in general. 

I find that I can understand everything, *everything*, transpiring around me socially. My problem, as you may have guessed, is that I can't handle too much of it. One on one with someone I know I'm fine and never have issues; in a crowd or with a stranger I almost always do. 

Of course, anytime anyone, aspies included, meet someone or interact with something, they are forming an understanding of the causative effects between themselves and the person/object. That's obvious. What isn't is how quickly I can personally do it, and the mass confusion I feel when I make a bad calculation. I can't interact ""naturally"" with people, I have to have at least an idea of how to simulate them in my head to even be slightly functional socially. 

As a result I'm put in about the same position as the majority of those in this community; I have a tendency to be awkward, I'm extremely clumsy, I tend to talk too much, have general alexithymia, etc.. The part I'm not really understanding is if this really has anything to do with Aspergers at all, disregarding if the effects are the same, and as a wider question, how on earth is Aspergers even defined? How can it possibly have a real, scientific definition if the ""appraisal"" of one's condition is determined by a clinical diagnosis, rather than quantitative evaluations? 

The ""definition"" given on the wiki page is amorphous at best, and when each individual characteristic is examined in a vacuum, it could easily apply to anyone. I certainly think that Spectrum disorders are real, and I don't mean in any way that I doubt the significance of psychological testing, but to be honest I'm a bit shocked by the way the process has been handled. I should be clear- my psychologist has been a paragon of professionalism, I'm just surprised there isn't a more concrete way to determine the position of an individual on the spectrum than to have a trained professional sit down and talk with you. Trained or no, I would never trust a subjective human being's perspective over scientific rigor and associated, peer reviewed literature. (And to further clarify, I'm quite well aware that each diagnosis is based upon peer reviewed literature, but it is peer reviewed by *geneticists specializing in ASD*, not psychologists.)

I do apologize for the long read as well, just had a few things I needed to get out. I'm more than willing to clear anything up if I was unintentionally verbose, and while I already have run most of this by my psychologist, I am really interested to hear what the rest of you have to say since I don't really know anyone with an ASD in real life. Thanks for your time :)

We received a medical diagnosis this year and have been seeking therapy. Unfortunately, in the last few months, my marriage has been on a downward spiral. The biggest reason is that my husband has anger issues. He gets annoyed about small things -- like being in a crowded store, or me asking him to put something away when he's tired, or me running late -- and takes it out on me in a rude and aggressive manner. He often apologizes after but by then the damage is already done. 

I'm pretty certain his mother has Asperger's too, and having lived with his family, I've seen that they didn't emotionally train him when he was younger. He is often rude with his family and instead of telling him that there is a better way to express his emotions, they just leave him be. I've seen several people on this forum talk about the importance of parenting a child with Asperger's and in my husband's case, I don't think this was done. 

My husband thinks I should ignore his outbursts but, honestly, I don't think this would be healthy for our marriage. When he has a meltdown, it ends up isolating me and makes me increasingly want to get out of the relationship. Because his parents have never told him that his behavior is unacceptable, he doesn't realize the full extent of how his anger affects me. A few hours later, he'll have forgotten that he had a meltdown at all, while I'll still be hurt and upset. He's told me several times that he'll work on it, but because he hasn't internalized the extent of the problem, I haven't really seen any results. 

He's also very very moody and sometimes ""just wakes up on the wrong side of the bed,"" and is snappy and reactive over every little thing. Finally, he also gets extremely angry when he's hungry but won't do anything about the situation i.e. eat immediately to satisfy his hunger. I feel like I never know what's coming next. Anyone have these problems and tips on what I can do to improve the situation? Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post!

Edited to add: My husband accepts his Asperger's diagnosis and sees it as a largely positive thing. While I'm glad that he finally has something that helps explains why he's different, I'd like to him understand that there are behaviors associated with Asperger's that are negatively affecting our marriage. Like having an emotional reaction over a schedule change or being unable to control his anger. How can I get him to understand this without him becoming defensive? I will change what I can but I need him to take responsibility for his actions.

Edited to add 2: Thank you for all your great responses. I guess the main point of posting this was to help me figure out how much I'm willing to put into the marriage to make it work. I know I have to be patient and work at it, but I don't want to do it at the cost of my self esteem or expectations of a supportive partner and a healthy, loving relationship. I don't think my husband realizes fully that he needs to work at it,  and I really want to know how to communicate this to him.

I've generally been a commenter on this subreddit, and I've tried to help you guys out as much as I can. I was hoping that I could get some advice about my current situation. I'm very frustrated, not to mention I've been crying almost non-stop. I'm ashamed to admit that I need help figuring this out, and I just hope at least one of you is willing to talk to me. Out of all the subreddits, this place seems to be where I'm understood best. I do have Aspergers. I'm 18 years old, female, and have a part-time job.

Recently, my mother decided that I was useless and ran off with her boyfriend. She took a large sum of money from me that I'd saved up, among some of my possessions that were valuable. Needless to say, she's an unfit parent and is no longer in contact with me because when I try to call her, she just never answers and never calls back. No, I have no idea where she is. And no, I don't know my father. 

So this lead to me being homeless for a while until I could move in with my aunt, who has many, many people living in her house. It's a three bedroom and I currently have one of them. I'm talking there's two whole families worth of people and children around here. Oh, and more are moving in. So I've been doing okay here, but I've been spending all my money on food that they all eat, and I've barely gotten to eat at all lately. I haven't been able to sign up for foodstamps yet because my mom signed up already and took them. I haven't had the chance to spend a day in the welfare office. I have bagels and nuts stashed in my room to feed me until Saturday I believe. I have to ask for rides to go anywhere (and pay for all of their gas, even if I'm not in the car), so you can imagine how frustrating that is when I don't have nearly enough for my own vehicle. I work most of the week, so on breaks I try to walk places and gather/buy food and essentials when I can. My boyfriend helps me out as well. 

I don't think anyone understands how difficult this is on me. My own flesh and blood mother wants nothing to do with me, and the relatives I'm staying with make me purchase things for them just because I have a job. I can't deal with this much longer. My aunt spoke to me yesterday about me sharing my room, and I just...I can't deal with it at all. I need privacy or I go insane.

I have the option of moving 400 miles away to stay with my sister. She has a very nice place, is an amazing person, and she would help me get at least two jobs. So if I moved, I'd actually get to save money and keep my sanity.

Literally the only reason I am here is because of my boyfriend. I love him dearly and I can't bear the thought of leaving, but I also can't stand being here. I'm miserable and starving most of the time. I can't help but feel like I need to just get out of here. But if I leave, my boyfriend and I are over.Neither of us can handle long-distance relationships. We both love eachother, but I really don't have many beneficial options right now.

When asked why I left my previous job, I told the truth. The manager said I shouldn't have 'disparaged my previous employer.'

I wouldn't have as much of a problem with this if I was little, but I'll be 22 next week and by now he should have a handle on things I like and dislike by this point in my life. I think because of my Asperger's he feels he needs to push on me even though on a number of occasions he pushes me to do things I already dislike and have tried. For example last night we were at a hot tub. I don't like hot tubs because I am sensitive to heat, and he has known this and that I don't like hot tubs. I tried to go in the tub but I overheated and got out quickly. He told me that I needed to try it again. This kind of thing isn't really new though. In the past he's forced me to eat eggs at breakfast even though I have an extreme sensitivity to them to the point where if I even look at them, much less smell them or taste them, I start gagging and almost puke. And he was well aware of this when he did it. He still tries to press me to eat them if he cooks them for breakfast though he doesn't insist anymore and I always refuse.

What should I do? I feel like he thinks he can force me to like things by making me do them even though he knows I don't like them. I don't know how to tell him that I really don't like some of these things and that it's not for lack of never having tried them before.

Through researching the disorder (for his benefit), I discovered that I am also an Aspie. Although I was hesitant to acknowledge my discovery, I finally became 100% sure of it while talking to other people on this forum. 

However, I have not told my parents as they are skeptical of psychology (and by skeptical, I mean ignorant) and do not approve of my thoroughly tattooed, Aspie boyfriend (I made the mistake of telling one of my siblings. I overshare. But I also wanted them to understand my boyfriend better, because they were angry he wouldn't talk as much to them). 

So, in short, I've come to the realization that my life has been, at least in part, dictated by a disorder--the good and the bad. But I have not revealed this to my parents in fear that they'll tell me I'm silly and just claim that I'm ""doing it"" because my boyfriend ""has"" Aspergers. 

This secret has been plaguing me for a long, long time now. I reached a boiling point two nights ago when my mom and sister were discussing a man with Aspergers who was in the news because he kept hijacking trains because he was obsessed with trains and conducting trains. While they thought the man shouldn't have been arrested because it was part of his disorder, their understanding quickly degressed into misunderstanding when I mentioned that a company should just hire and train the guy to conduct trains, since he knows all about them. 

Immediately, they both started smiling and laughing, saying that there was no way they could do that because it would be so dangerous. They claimed that people with Aspergers had to take special tests to see if they could perform, and that they simply would not pass. I told them they were wrong, to which my mother replied ""no, trust me on this. They wouldn't pass the test"". 

In short, they legitimately believe that people with Aspergers are mentally handicapped. Like, to the point of retardation. 

Furthermore, I guess they also think I've been dating a mentally disabled man. 

How the hell can we start teaching the masses about Aspergers? It is extremely infuriating to watch people I love misunderstand other people that I love. 

My mom has MET my boyfriend before. What. the. fuck. 

I am just so, fucking angry. 

What were they trying to do? Were they trying to get me to stop dating him? I feel like they were trying to plant doubt in my mind...""trust me"". Fucking...stupid. As if I know less then them about something so important to my life--even if I didn't have it, the person I love does! It's just crazy. 

I feel so hurt and sad.

Is this true for you all? 

I've been diagnosed with AS, and I'm a 26 year old married female. Sex has always been a sore spot with my husband and me. I have vaginismus, which contributes, but even when we've been able to get that more under control I don't handle sex well. I want to like it...but ...

I was a virgin when I got married. I was a very late bloomer sexually and had moral/religious convictions about remaining a virgin till marriage. But I /did/ have a sex drive and get turned on and wanted my fiancé... But when we got married it was hard because of the vaginismus, which I previously had no idea about, and it's been a problem ever since. 

I don't like the feel of skin on skin. I can't stand the feel of it if there's sweat involved--which is obviously common. I've only ever climaxed from external simulation of the clitoris... sometimes I get to where I don't like certain kinds of touch that normally I like... and until I get turned on, I have to really force myself to engage because it brings me no pleasure to, for instance, kiss his neck or touch him sensually. 

On the other hand, my husband has a very high sex drive--in my opinion abnormally high (not based on my limited experience but on what I've read). He wants it all the time and I feel completely inadequate and unable to satisfy. When we do it, we do it well, but it never seems to be enough. And even though he tries not to pressure me, I sense his discomfort and pressure myself, which turns me off more. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? Does anyone know of anything that could help increase sex drive or desensitize or increase pleasure? ?

It's at the point where I sometimes wonder if we can even continue the marriage like this. We've been married 3.5 years... I don't know.

I was diagnosed with AS about five months ago. I suffer from depression and social anxiety, which I attribute to being socially dysfunctional. I can’t remember ever not being terribly insecure in social situations and have spent most of my life avoiding them. It was only recently that I decided that I need to change this, and in retrospect I noticed that this decision actually coincided with an increase in my cannabis use.  
  
  
Smoking cannabis greatly reduces my anxiety level and eliminates all depressive feelings. In social situations it removes my inner censor-- that hesitation between having a thought and deciding to act on it. But more that that, it makes me feel centred and at peace with myself. The phrase I keep coming back to is that “I feel more like a person”. I feel like the person I want to be, and find that I like that person very much. I can share what I'm thinking and really engage with people without feeling self-conscious about it. Eye contact and everything. And it all feels so effortless, like I imagine it should.  
  
  
What I also find is that the feeling of calm and centred-ness actually persists well after the “high” wears off-- that if I smoke in the evening I still feel great well into the next morning. I haven’t done that much research into how cannabis works, but I wonder if this is just a reduction of my “normal” anxiety level; ie it takes that long for my anxiety to build back up after being reduced by the drug effect.  
  
  
The perspective cannabis use has given me; of showing me who I am without anxiety, has made me more acutely aware of the huge amount of anxiety I carry with me all the time. A person should not have to live like this. So I suppose you’d call it self-medicating. I understand that heavy cannabis use can be harmful in the long term, but I see it as a really effective tool for overcoming anxiety until I can become comfortable enough with social situations that they don’t trigger anxiety in the first place; the same way a prescribed medication might be used.  
  
  
I’d be really interested to hear from other aspies about whether they have had a similar experience with cannabis, or have used any other recreational drugs to self-medicate. Or y'know, if you think I'm delusional about the benefits and I just like the justification to high all the time.

I don't believe that I actually lack the capacity to have empathy. I'm just oblivious to what people are feeling most of the time because I'm busy thinking about other things. If I realize I've hurt someone, I feel terrible about it. I've always figured most autistic people worked similarly in that respect. 

But I recently had an experience with an autistic person that raised some questions for me. This person did something deliberately vicious out of the blue, and I was shocked and didn't understand why he did it. When I asked why, he acted like I had been rude to him but he refused to elaborate.   

I racked my brains and couldn't think of what I could have done to offend him. I'm pretty sure I didn't really do anything wrong at all. I guess maybe he just decided he doesn't like me or my opinions, or he's working on misinformation fed to him by someone else. I thought maybe he didn't realize how much he had hurt me, so I told him, but then he just got even meaner. There seemed to be more venom in him than I'd expect from any NT. It seemed completely irrational, and I was surprised at his apparently total lack of empathy.   

They say we lack theory of mind and empathy, but I've never really thought that was accurate until this experience. I don't have much contact with other autistic people, so I don't have much information to work with. This has made me wonder if autism is more of a disability than we like to think.  

As far as I'm aware, autistic people aren't more likely than NTs to commit crimes. This has been studied, right? But that could be attributed to any number of things, like an aversion to criminal lifestyles or a lack of interest in criminal sorts of behaviours.

It's just these little things that made notice it and got me a little worried. For instance: when I ask it to do a lot of things at once by incoherent commands, it will say that a certain programm is not responding, makes some noise over it and seems to be idle or non-responsive for a bit. Eventually it will open the correct pages though, but it takes a while when I'm asking a lot at once. I'm so annoyed by this, why can't it just execute my incoherent and plural commands at once without freaking out for a bit?

Sometimes I try to communicate with it and have it tell me what he knows; he likes doing that. He loves doing math and knows lots of historic and scientific facts, but it has problems with face recognition sometimes and isn't very good at just talking about day to day stuff. Despite his analytic skills and intellect, it seems to be really uncertain about everything social and psychological. When I talk to him about it, he gives me a list of possible explanations that often conflict with one another and I'm afraid it's not very good at filtering the correct information from all the signals that's entering it.

That last bit really happens a lot though. Usually it's very friendly and one of the best co-workers I have, but sometimes, due to the filtering problems it's like there is a memory leak that make him react slow, be more noisy, unresponsive or just give me pages and pages and hours upon hours of data on the same subject. It sometimes even shuts down completely :o Especially when I keep changing the subject. It always replies about the same subject and it can change topics to a related subject, it usually links to them itself, but just a random fluid conversation seems impossible.

I'm really fed up with him for not being able to guess what I want without me expressively telling him. Why can't it just see what I need or want from him?

ps: He's a good guy though! If you give him very specific orders or questions and a good structured environment, no one will be as capable and dedicated as he is, therefore I wouldn't want to replace him with anyone else! Also, it's non judgmental and despite what he perceives as my erratic behavior, it will not turn its back to me... it takes time, but once you get to know him, he's easy to be a good and appreciated friend. It might not react to me in ways I'm used to, but it seems happy when I'm back. I think so at least, always hard to tell though.

I am interested to see if some of the things that bother me are shared by others. 

Here are a few things that bother me.

1. I seem to see the world in a very black and white way so things like double standards really bother me. 

2. My time going to college was very difficult because I was studying psychology and the social sciences. I now understand why people say the soft sciences are a joke because they are. Most research always starts off with a desired outcome in mind then people just work backwards to find evidence to support it. 

3. Athiests that deny science and historical evidence to bash religion. I don't really think a person needs to look that hard to find an issue with religion so it irks me when people are lazy and make up things. Violence, rape, oppression, fighting over land, etc all existed before organized religion and can be seen in nature so I hate when people try to blame all the bad things in the world on Religion or a certain religion. 

4. I hate bicyclists and motorcyclists because these people never follow laws and seem to stress me out while driving. Just yesterday we almost hit a motorcyclist who didn't signal or look before changing lanes. I hate having to slow down and give these people so much space because I know they drive like they are suicidal. I had one experience in my past where I almost hit a motorcycle that had a driver and passenger, when it was weaving between traffic on the interstate. Thankfully I am a super defensive driver. I would have killed those people most likely if I had even slightly touched them while they were going 70+ miles per hour. Bikes I just hate because they get to choose if they want to be a pedestrian or vehicle whenever its convenient to them. I guess that goes into my double standards.

The reason for this is that a lot of the self-screening tests currently on the Internet suffer from some problems--they use tests that aren't clinically validated (like the Aspie-Quiz) or don't have that much specificity/sensitivity (like the AQ), some require a lot of time to take even if a person *clearly* has or doesn't have ASD, and they often encourage interpretation fallacies like [base rate neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy).

My idea is to make a website which implements several reliable, well-validated screening tests for ASD, provides useful statistical intepretation of the results, and uses a ""branching tree"" paradigm to reduce the amount of time it actually takes to take the tests (i.e. by starting with a fast but not very precise test and only proceeding to a more involved one if the results from the first are ambiguous).

My cousin Jade was born to my mothers sister (whom I will refer to as monicrack) when she was 35 years old, who is an avid meth addict since she was 15ish. Jade had a bother born a few years earlier, but died at birth from sever downs. 

Jade was being raised mostly by the rest of the family, but most of the care was left to my 2nd cousin (Ill refer her to as Ricque) when Ricque was just 12 years old. 

Jade was passed from house to house, and while she was in the care of Monicrack, lived in garages, vans and only ""god"" knows where else. At one point, when Jade was a mire 3/4 years old, they lived in a shack in someones backyard, using a bucket as a toilet. 

Well, when Jade was 5, my mother (Ill refer her to as Susan), decided enough was enough and she was going to get custody of Jade. Which sounds like an awesome thing right? No. My mom was is a unmedicated, bipolar, and very very very abusive, mentally and physically, person. 

The way my mom went about it was she asked Monicrack to have Jade for Thanksgiving. Monicrack complied and Susan just never gave her back. As soon as she got her, she went to the court house and gained legal custody of Jade. 

Within the amount of time Jade was with my mother, Jade was treated as a slave and a punching bag for my mother to relieve stress on. I, at this point, was 18 living on my own, with my new daughter and fiance. I tried calling CPS several times on her, and tried my hardest to fight for Jade as much as I could... but I failed. All CPS did was go to her house, tell her to clean it up (Susan is also a hoarder) and that was that. 

The rest of the family was banned from visiting or keeping in contact with Jade, so they never understood the severity of the situation that I constantly tried explaining to them. My family is was part of the first generation of Hungarians to come to the US during the war. Trying to get them to understand American way of life is hard, and getting them to fight for certain things is even harder. 

 Well, last year, Susan decided she wanted to start anew and move two states away.. but Jade was in her way and she could no longer take care of her... So my mom called me. I couldnt take her in myself, my husband had just left me and my two children for another woman, and I had no job at that point, but I was willing to help raise Jade with Ricque (Now 23 with her own two kids and husband). 

Ricque took her to a therapist right away and found out Jade has aspergers.... 

WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WERE DOING! Its so hard not to get frustrated with her.. were two young moms that have never had to go threw any of this. She is high functioning, which makes it harder to decipher if a certain action is because of her Aspergers or if its a normal preteen action. 

She lies, steals, is so desperate for attention but sooooo socially awkward. She seeks male attention most of all and were concerned its going to make her wind up pregnant by 16. 

She cant even wash her hair without direction, neither lone take care of a baby. 

We dont know how to discipline efficiently, nor teach her how to make friends (most kids find her weird or just pick on her for being too tall, pimply and weird) due to funds we cant afford a therapist.. so were left to finding others who might know more than we do.. any kind of suggestions will help!

1364416251.0,18,self.aspergers,1b4rph,I want to talk about meltdowns,22,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1b4rph/i_want_to_talk_about_meltdowns/,"1) can you ever function to some degree during a meltdown? Sometimes I can manage to drive, other times not. One day I was able to do some light work in between my worst moments because I just absolutely had to had to had to get some things done. It was seriously awful. 

2) what things help you identify that it has reached meltdown stage? I cry a lot, but my crying during a melt down is different. Louder, more intense, feeling like I can't breathe or calm down, also feeling extremely violent toward myself and others - including inanimate objects. Also screaming happens. Shaking.  Tense all over. Racing but repetitious thoughts. 

3) are your meltdowns often caused either directly or indirectly by one or more other people? Once you his meltdown stage, doesn't it just make you enraged at that person for bringing you to that point of no return? I get SO angry. If they would just understand me and behave differently, I wouldn't have to get to the point of fighting of a meltdown or having a full-blown meltdown. I'm not saying its fair or reasonable to blame, but am I the only one who just starts despising people in the middle of meltdowns?

4) doesn't it just ruin your whole day after you have a meltdown? I feel like crap about myself and angry at people who might have been involved, plus sad and/or stressed and/or angry about the original issue, plus I freak out about the time I lost in my day for work and chores that need to be done, plus I feel exhausted - like totally drained afterward. And it seems to give me the opposite effect of ""rose-colored glasses"" where everything looks bleak and gray. 

5) how do you prevent or stop or recover from meltdowns? I don't have a set way that works for me. Sometimes my husband can hold me to calm me down if he wasn't part of the original cause, but other times I can't stand being touched. I've turned to various drugs that work sometimes...  Napping doesn't work. Journaling works maybe sometimes. Praying helps sometimes. I can't seem to really stop it in the middle. It has to mostly ride its course and then I can try to do something to transition back to... Real life. 

6) I don't know about you all, but meltdowns make me feel SO misunderstood, and being understood is HUGE for me. When I'm having a meltdown, I feel more convinced than at any other time that absolutely no one in my life understands me the least little bit. And I can't tell if that thought/feeling is true or just an emotion. I feel crappy because no one understands what happened or why it even bothered me - and especially not why it bothered me to such an extreme degree - and they get freaked out and bothered and/or feel guilty because of my outward manifestations of the meltdown, so I feel crappy for that, too, and then they seem to feel that once I do calm down, everything is okay because the crazy out-of-proportion outburst is over, and they completely fail to understand that for me and how my brain and emotions work, that reaction was completely IN proportion to what I was experiencing, and even if I calm down its still not all better!! And to top it all off, I am expected to apologize for my ""inappropriate"" behavior!! 

7) I don't know what to say. I don't hate my AS. I don't even hate meltdowns. I hate the complete lack of understanding I get from anyone in my life. I hate the way I end up feeling completely isolated. I hate how miserable I feel, especially when I don't think it should have to be this way. :( 

I just want to be understood. More than anything right now...

Yesterday was a bad day. From the moment I woke up I knew it would be. These days are not frequent for me (thank deity of choice), but when they do happen I can't stand to be around other people. I get frustrated and can't concentrate, I easily go off if provoked even if it's just in jest. And I sometimes break all contact with the world and just sit with my eyes closed and humming to create a sound barrier. 

I didn't go to classes, I hardly left my room and hardly said more than a few sentences to my roomie. I needed desperately to be alone and be undisturbed. Now my roomie automatically senses these things and leaves me alone. He doesn't get it, but he gets my need to be left alone and is very nice about it.

We had group work in one of my classes that day, I got a text: ""where are you?"", I merely answered ""home"". I knew I was being a bad friend and an even worse group member. I felt terrible, but I wouldn't lie and say I was ill. I'm trying my best not to lie even if it sometimes is easier than explaining why I do the things I do.

Today was a bit better and I met my group in town to work. They didn't ask, but I felt I needed to explain why I hadn't been to school. I did my best to explain that some days are just hard and on those days I can't be around other people, even friends or family. I expected them to shake their heads and tell me I was being silly. Instead they just said, ""Alright, just let us know next time, it's cool""

I simply wanted to share with you all how grateful I am for having such understanding friends and how just telling the truth can sometimes set you free. ",,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,,True,t3_14q1ux,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/14q1ux/bad_day_good_friends/,

1354413939.0,18,self.aspergers,144qpt,A small rant about empathy.,24,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/144qpt/a_small_rant_about_empathy/,"Okay, I'm actually pretty tired of the idea that people with Asperger's Syndrome (or Autism) don't have empathy. That's a load of bullshit.

As a person with Asperger's Syndrome, I can say that I am highly empathetic. Maybe it's because I'm a woman. But that doesn't mean men with the same condition lack empathy either. Our main difficulty isn't our lack of empathy at all. It's that we don't know how to SHOW our empathy. We can't demonstrate or display it as well as neurotypical people can.

It doesn't mean we lack empathy. We have it. We just can't express it as well. We struggle when it comes to expressing all kinds of emotion. We have these emotions but we don't necessarily understand them or know how to express them as well as other folk. That is all.

I've always related well to animals. Maybe I understand animals better than the average person, similar to Temple Grandin. She made a living out of the fact that she understood how cattle thought, because she could relate to them perfectly. I think it's true that those of us with autism and Asperger's have very simple emotions. We feel fear, uncertainty and anxiousness more than anything else. That's why many people on the spectrum get diagnosed with depression and other mental illnesses.

We're not mentally ill by default. We may BECOME mentally ill due to the environments we're forced to live in. 

Temple understood that cattle sought out an unusual or interesting object and thus, it prevented and distracted them on the line to slaughter. She understood how cattle thought, and knew how to change it. She was an advocate for improving the conditions for these cattle, even though she wasn't against their eventual slaughter. In her field, she is a genius... all because she was born with autism.

I myself have always felt a strong connection with animals. I understood them. I knew when they might be scared. I didn't want to frighten an animal. I didn't want to corner them. Whenever I've encountered an animal the first and foremost thing on my mind would be how that animal FELT around me. Would they be afraid? Would this environment be good for them? Would they feel content here? I have always connected with animals on a way I don't think most neurotypicals do. 

When I see a muzzled dog or a cat that's uncomfortable in its environment, I want to scream and cry. I feel so terrifically sorry for those animals that I want to save them from their sub-optimal environments. I feel like I know these animals better, that I would know how to provide for them and that I would be able to give them a safer environment to live in. I almost feel like I understand animals more than I understand people. Their needs are simple, just like my needs are simple. I feel like most humans don't understand what animals want at all and it terrifies me.

As an Aspie, I feel like I'm lost in a world of cruelty and a lack of empathy, an emotion I feel a LOT of especially towards creatures that don't have a voice. I don't think we as Aspies or autistic folk lack empathy... we just don't know how to express it.

Sorry if this is random or out of place, I just wanted somewhere to vent.

I think I'd rather not have conformation than go through that. So many mention diagnosis for kids, but I've never seen any mention adults....

My brother has many of the typical symptoms of Aspergers - he finds social situations stressful, hates crowds, struggles with eye contact, freezes up on physical contact, clumsy, dyslexic, obsessive routines etc - and was diagnosed early on at school. He hated school all the way through, but received a lot of help and assistance to get him through and help him understand why he was struggling without feeling alienated or strange. 

However, for some reason I don't understand, as an adult he receives no assistance and finds working life incredibly stressful. In his current job, he has gotten so stressed that he has made himself ill. When I found him the other day, he was crying and shaking very violently - it was incredibly distressing to see, especially seen as he is such a gentle, sweet and peaceable person and I have always felt very protective of him. He told me that he is tired of having to force himself to engage in social situations, reading things he doesn't understand and feels like he just makes mistakes all the time. 

So, I decided to write to you guys to ask for your help. I want to be able to better understand how my brother is feeling. Although my brother and I have always been very close since childhood, I know I can never really know how it feels to see the world through his eyes.

I want to ask if anyone with Aspergers can give me some insight into how they personally feel about working, what they find stressful and difficult and ways I might be able to help and comfort my brother. 

I know everyone is, of course, very different in what they experience and what they feel, but I felt this might be able to help me in helping my brother deal with his anxieties.

I know that Aspies tend to latch on to a friend, even at young ages. My son is that way (Diagnosed with Asperger's), I am that way (Not formally diagnosed, but fit almost all the same criteria my son does). It's like nothing is important than hanging out with that one friend you make, and it almost feels like betrayal if they want to do something else. I was intensely like that as a kid, and I see it in him now with his friends.

For me, I feel like a lot of that tendency rubbed off on me when it came to dating, and now marriage. I was never one that even thought about playing the field, or cheating. From the beginning, I had in mind when dating, that if the girl wasn't someone I'd consider spending the rest of my life with, I wasn't interested in even dating them.

I'm not saying my wife and I have a perfect relationship. We bicker, we fight, but we work things out. I see a lot of my same age friends who are Neurotypicals all going through divorces, cheating on their wives, etc. I just cannot comprehend this happening. I'd be as likely to blow my own brains out as I would to cheat on my wife.

That having been said, I'm not like a hopeless romantic or anything, And I have my own issues with expressing emotion well, or interpreting them well. But just because there's a barrier with the input/output doesn't mean the data isn't there on the inside.

http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/08/15/technology-problem-you-dark-side-tech-addiction

In it, Bill outlines what he considers to be online addiction. I answered yes to three of his questions (spending more than 2 hours a day online, thinking about the internet when not on it, and talking to strangers, which I do right here on Reddit, if that counts). According to him, if you answer yes to even one question, then you're an online addict. He then goes on to talk about how horrible it is that kids would rather be inside playing online games than outside playing sports.

From my point of view, this is incredibly ignorant. I consider myself to be much more social when online because, being anonymous, I can say things I wouldn't normally say with the social awkwardness I usually have when out in public. Also, when did liking the internet become an addiction? If I see something funny on youtube or reddit, I'm going to think back to it and maybe tell friends about it. Big whoop. Also, I always hated sports and never enjoyed playing them one bit. Too much reliance on others, plus there's no plot or engaging characters.

So forgive me for being an addict. Sorry if this was really ranty, but I just don't get how people whose job it is to report things can be so closed-minded.

I began seeing somebody with Aspbergers to maybe start a relationship, but I really didn't know much about the condition. The only book in the library was one for girls. Ok, well, I'll read it.

And there's not a single thing I disagree with in that book. Every chapter describes me perfectly. As stated in the title, I took the Ritvo test, and got really high scores. 

After years of trying to self-diagnose, and therapists/psycholigists hopping from diagnosis to diagnosis, I've been trying to shove myself into whatever hole I can fit into. But I never quite fit perfectly into any hole. But with Aspbergers, I fit bloddy perfectly. 

I'm going to try to go back to school in the fall, but now I'm freaking out. Like, literally sitting in the corner hugging my stuffed animal freaking out. Because I didn't expect for there to be anything wrong with me.

After all, I've always been told that there's nothing wrong with me at all. That I just need to stop being an idiot, stop being lazy, stop being a fuck-up. And that everything was my fault and I just needed to change.  And I was constantly confused as to how to change. Because I didn't quite know what I was doing wrong, I just knew I was doing stuff wrong. 

I know this doesn't really make any sense because my mind is kinda everywhere. I'm sorry about that. I just am not sure where to go, where to start. With a family who just finds me weird, but refuses to understand me, I'm at a loss. One thing I like to do is go to parks alone and watch people. So I did that today, and Grammie can't understand why I like to do that. And I tried to explain it to her, and she doesn't want an explination. She just thinks it's weird and stupid. 

Sorry for all the negativity. If it breaks the rules, please take it down. I'm sorry.

I hope you all have a great day.

I don't really have friends; I have some colleagues. When engaging in social interaction (particularly involving someone who I don't know very well), I am reasonably good at appearing to be friendly and engaging. I can do this for perhaps an hour and after this my performance deteriorates. As far as I can guess, the simulation I'm putting on takes a huge amount of concentration (""How long should I look in his left eye?"" ""Am I standing in the right position?"" ""Laugh now."" - You know how it is.) and it tires me out after about an hour. If I attempt to engage without all of this simulation (although I'm not sure exactly what I would be without this simulation; at this stage I suspect I have become part of this simulation), I am unappealing to people.

I think I have three problems that I don't really know how to address. The first problem is not that I can't socialise; I can pass with this for a time. It is that it is exhausting. Is there an approach to dealing with this?

The second problem is something I'm not quite sure how to put into words properly. How do I disentangle myself from the socially appealing simulation I'm running? I feel as though I have been running these socialising rules for so long that I have somewhat become them. This is not pleasant because these rules are exhausting. Is there some way to revert to what I may have been in the past?

The third problem is about friendship. Basically, how do I make friends (given the aforementioned limitations)? Further, what would you consider to be a friend?

I thank you for any thoughts you may have.

TL;DR: Is there a way for socialising to be relaxing, not exhausting? How does one really 'turn off' the socially appealing simulation?

Long story short, I'm nineteen and my therapist thinks I show symptoms consistent with Asperger's. It came as a surprise. For the past month I have been researching through this subreddit and google and haven't landed on a definitive answer yet. I've taken the online tests and they seem to confirm his suspicions. I have a hard time seeing it, though. The problem is I don't have any special interest. At least, none that have been with me for months at a time. I get interested in something, I read about it, get bored, and move on. I think I may tend to get obsessed more often than other people but never to the point that it lasts months and consumes most of my time.

The point of this post is I told a close family member about it (I really just wanted to talk to somebody about it) and... he laughed at me and  said, ""That's not a real disease."" Then he went to WebMD or something similar (we were on the phone) and kept laughing and saying ""If this is a disease then 95% of Reddit has it!""

So yeah... I told one of the two (not exaggerating) people I trust enough to share this kind of thing with about my mental health concerns and got made fun of at length. So here I am telling a bunch of strangers instead. Yay internet.

I'm sure I've forgotten some, so feel free to comment with any traits you have.

These are some of my personality traits:

* Artisitc.

* Hard to deal with annoying, repetitive noises in general, but cannot stand nail biting. I have to leave the room because it's just... so... augh. Eating with mouth open a close second.

* Sometimes when talking I use the wrong sounds. Like, I'll want to say 'bark' and will instead say 'berk'. 

* Very limited/no interest in sex. Porn does nothing to me, to the point where others obsession with it is just confusing.

* Little interest in listening to music. (Though I enjoy playing music a little).

* Speaking of music, can play anything I hear, even if it's only once, on piano by ear first time with chords. (Sounds a bit like I'm boasting, haha, but I don't want to downplay it in case someone else can do it - which would be awesome.)

* Extremely self-reflective.

* Extremely aware of surroundings. Perhaps due to nail-biting paranoia, or perhaps nail-biting paranoia due to it, but I know where everyone's hands are at any given moment. I know who is looking at who and basically everything that everyone is doing. Not intentionally.

* Great sense of direction. Could be just increased spacial awareness due to all the drawing, though.

I don't have issues with sensory overload and all that jazz. I do have a strong interest in certain subjects, I'm a rational thinker, I have a light information addiction, I feel uncomfortable in new settings around new people and don't empathize all that well with others.

But enough about my background. Normally I don't have any problems maintaining ""normal"" eye contact. I used to look away while people were talking to me when I was a kid, but my parents pointed it out to me and my behavior corrected itself over time. Nowadays I don't really think about it.

However, in some situations I'm painfully aware of it. I went to an info session today. I had a whole inner monologue going on. *Alright, that person's talking... just look at her normally. Whoa, don't stare. That looks creepy. Don't worry, I got this. Just look away subtly. No, that was NOT subtle. Look at the person across the room who's now talkin-- wait, he's already done, move back. Crap, you're being spastic and this probably looks weird. Look at the speaker, but whatever you remember that it's not acceptable to glance at her boobs. Good so far... dude, NO! And I didn't even want to see that! Now I'm giving off the wrong impression.*

WTF, brain!? I'm trying to maintain normal eye contact here like I usually do and you're screwing up. I know I'm not perfect in that regard, but if I could just stop worrying about eye contact I'd have less trouble with these situations.

",20,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/qkfgz/aspie_or_not_im_just_not_equipped_for_all_this/,"Yesterday I found myself asking how in the world I survived 25 yrs of life if I'm so ill-equipped to handle stress. I don't know if I'm an Aspie. It would explain a lot. My husband thinks I am, and I relate a lot to everything I've spent hours and hours reading about it. I mentioned it to my primary doc Friday, and she said I can see a psychologist about it. There are no neuropsychologists in the area, though, so that's out. 

But I'm not posting necessarily to ask you all if I'm AS. That would be a whole other long-winded post. I'm posting because I can't deal, and I don't know what to do. 

My husband had to go to the ER Mon night. I was rather calm and focused, right until it was time to drive home, when I had my first meltdown (not first EVER). Since then, everything has been crap. I meltdown almost every time I have to talk to someone in the Army (my husband is a soldier, so all his care is Army-provided). The day after he was admitted to the hospital I had to literally chant ""everything is going to be ok everything is going to be ok"" nonstop for 2-3 hrs just to function enough to gather my husband's supplies the hospital wanted and make the drive there. If I stopped, I melted down. The following day I called the doc but they couldn't see me, so I sat outside the ER for a half hr crying and stimming and trying to talk myself into doing it... I finally went in, and they did give me some more of my extremely low dose anxiety med that I had run out of (with no refills). 

One night I had to go thru a tornado warning on my own and sleep in the closet, and if I hadn't been doped up on NyQuil I don't know what I would have done. 

Friday I almost melted down at the doc office when she challenged some of my opinions about how things were going

Saturday was the worst of all, as I was heading to the hospital to visit my husband and got in a wreck. And it's relevant so I'll add we live 25 mins away from anywhere on gravel roads. After my wreck I had to climb a hill 10 mins from my car and stand in the cold wind just to get cell phone reception, and when I called my mom she was afraid I was going into shock... I paced and cried and chanted and screamed for 2.5 hrs waiting for the tow truck to find me, and then had another meltdown when I got home to try and talk to my husband on the phone... Sunday, more meltdowns. 

Yesterday I tried to drive my car to the shop to get it fixed up and I got pulled over because my tire was going flat. I melted down right away and I'm sure the cops thought I was nuts. I was going slow with my hazards on and was like 3 mins from the shop, but they wouldn't let me go. I had to call my insurance to get towed and the guy was like ""why are you so emotional?"" ... I continued to be unable to calm down. When the cop explained he was giving me a verbal for impeding the flow of traffic and safety violation all I could do was five him the thumbs up and say through clenched teeth ""I hear you.""

Strangely, I calmed right down when the tow truck arrived cuz It was the same guy from
Saturday... I got in his truck and felt calm because it was familiar... 

But melted down again when I went to the hospital later to visit my husband. 

Thank God my mom realized I'm absolutely unable to deal with any more and she booked a flight last night, so she'll me arriving Thursday. 

In the meantime... It's about all I can do to feed the animals and myself and keep driving to the hospital to visit my husband. :(

What i meant is that it's a lot to cope and deal with.** 

I'm writing this to get this all out there. I am really tired and stressed out and I think this will help. I just want other people out there to know what I've been through. What happened to me is pretty much unforgivable, and if it wasn't for my parents buying me groceries, and supporting me financially I wouldn't be OK. There's also the miracle that I haven't resorted to suicide yet. 

I dropped out of school when I was 15. I was prescribed too much medication by a pill pushing doctor afterwards. I was sent to a psych ward when I was 15 because I had a huge mental breakdown. I thought that I would go crazy due to medication. The Doctors wouldn't tell me any information about it and I was experiencing side effects I knew nothing about. I was discharged after a long period of time. I tried a few other options for finishing highschool. I was met with more trauma. I was diagnosed with Asperger's at 17. I went through some therapy with a behavioral management specialist, and then an occupational therapist. I stopped trying to finish school for awhile. I started hanging around with crazy idiots. A bunch of my ex friends ended up wanting to kill me for some reason. I was threatened while I was walking one night, and I became a shut in because I was traumatized from this event.

The last thing I was working on with my therapists was an attempt at getting my own apartment, with money provided through the government and home care workers to help me learn how to do basic things around the house. (None of which I have a problem with. The only thing I had problems with was the large amount of intrusive thoughts and anxiety, and living with my parents. It was a bullshit concept.)

When I was 18 an ambulance came to my house and took me away to the hospital for a second time. It was pretty much my biggest fear, besides that of being alone. Apparently, to be involved with the assited living group home, or 'theraputic' group home I would have to have medical tests done. Due to my previous experiences with Doctor's, and traumatic psych ward experiences I was *afraid of hospitals.* However, I was an agoraphobic shut in at the time. My BMS, OT and the people in charged convinced my parents to call the ambulance without my knowledge. It was their flawed logic that sending me to the hospital to get medical tests done would help me. **None of this was done with my knowledge. No one actually explained what was going on. I was 18 and they were treating me like a child. No one told me, for 6 months, they were planning to send me to the hospital again.**

However, I'm not sure how accurate that summary is as  it was traumatic for everyone. I went into shock, a lot. I can't get the straight story from my Dad. It's pretty confusing. That's basically what happened. I've pieced it together after a few years.

The first night in the hospital was very traumatic and I went into shock. I don't remember much. I woke up and everything got worse. The pill pushing Dr. visited me with the biggest, fattest, tallest most intimating nurse he could find and tried to explain to me that he wanted me to up my medications. The big fat mean nurse was there to well, intimidate me. I wasn't given a choice. He then proceeded to explain to me that I was to stay in the psychiatric ward. The same one as 3 years ago. I had a nervous breakdown, and was forced to take seroquel and bigger doses of my other medications. Seroquel is a dissolving pill. I couldn't fake swallowing it. 

The psychiatric ward was horrible. I live in a small town. The psych ward is cramped. If something happens in your brain, and you need help, you are stored here. There are literally 15 year old girls living with 60 year old pedophiles, schizophrenic 20 something year olds, dementia patients, drug addicts, etc. The people that stand out in my mind, are well, the examples I just listed. They are real examples. I wasn't exaggerating. Also, when I was 15 I met someone who had fetal alcohol syndrome who is pretty much insane. I'll get into that one later. Also, a worker there is allegedly a pedophile. Things that stand out in my mind is a dementia patient who would constantly cry. Constantly. 24/7. I'm sensitive to noise because of my Aspergers. This was not a good combination. There was a 60 year old recovering alcohol whose wife divorced him through the telephone. He ended up in a locked room banging on the doors while we were in lockdown.

Keep in mind, this psych ward was about one hallway long. That one hallway had all our bedrooms. There was one eating area and one dining area. Two showers with unlocked doors.

I managed to get outings with my parents. I went out as much as I could as long as I could.

Then, some people involved with the group home arrived and claimed that they had a much better place that would be able to help me. I agreed and signed my life away. (Almost literally.) I ended up living in a house with constantly locked doors. It was a three floor house, pretty normal and typical. However, there was a room with nothing in it, with a live video feed. This was used for when someone became violent. It wasn't soundproof, unfortunately. There were at least two workers 24/7. There was supposed to be one male, and one female. One person for cooking and another person for safety. (If someone became violent.) It was hard to believe than an obese 300+ female and 60 year old man with bad knees who survived 3 heart attacks was supposed to protect us when someone became violent though. There were two other patients there, besides myself.

One person was about 30 years old. He was adopted by his parents. They weren't even his biological parents, but they took on raising him. He had severe low functioning Autism. He couldn't eat, clean himself, or really speak properly. He could memorize every date in every calendar from 1775 to 2025. However, he has regressive autism. His brain couldn't organize his memories properly, hence the low functioning part of his autism...  This Autistic person was only about 30. He was also very troubled. When I arrived in the group home the walls were literally peppered with holes, which were plastered over. I didn't realize it was by his doing until he started putting a hole in the wall literally every day. He would also scream every day, and tell everyone to fuck off every day in a strange idiosyncratic voice. (It sounded oddly like Terrence McKenna's voice.) He would also bang the dinner table. (The only way we were allowed to eat food, was if we ate with everyone at the dinner table. It was either food + noise, or no food + lesser noise.)  The workers were not very well informed about Autism and sensory integration. I had to introduce *them* to the fact that a weighted blanket would help him be able to eat properly. He would always bend the forks too much when eating, and press hard on things and rock back and fourth. I feel really guilty I couldn't help, but, I think it was almost ""Stockholm Syndrome"" as I started to care for people who risked my safety and sanity on a lot of occasions. I at least can look back on it and say it was not this guy's fault he was so messed up, he didn't understand any of it.

On a side note, one of the 'float' nurses who was pretty grounded and one of the only honest people in that house told me the first time he met this guy, he chased him with a knife and told him he was going to cut off his penis.

It was especially heartbreaking to see someone forget everything because my Grandfather suffered Alzheimer's before he died. But, my Grandfather lived a full life and was the survivor of a bad tuberculosis infection, which killed off all 5 of his brothers. (I could have that wrong.) My Grandfather's death is one of the other reasons I couldn't cope with highschool, and dropped out. I didn't see my Grandfather at the hospital, and it killed me when I was 15. He forgot how to eat too.

I wrote a post before about my son and symptoms he's been displaying. Since then he's been medically diagnosed with ASD and getting specialised education. Its been quite a relief to know what to do.

I also feel it's been a learning experience for myself.

I've noticed similarities with myself and him and the same age. (My mother also says we're exactly alike)

Things that stick out in my childhood memories are, having a stutter in social situations when I was in primary school, being highly anxious with a lot of people around, terrified of authority and walking around on tiptoes.

Nowadays, also sometimes intense paranoia especially in work situations.

I feel as I'm getting older its getting harder to not alienate everyone. 
It feels like everything outside of home life is .. fake? for lack of a better word.  Going through the motions, etc.

I also feel like I need a task or I'll drive myself crazy.
Although taking anti-depressants seems to help a great deal!

Is there any sort of social help out there so a guy doesn't turn into an old hermit?

Thanks.

When I was a child, I was pretty much textbook Asperger's. I attribute the fact that no one thought to diagnose me to the fact that it was the late 90s/early 2000s, when Asperger's and other high-functioning autism was just starting to become noticed in the way that it is today, and the fact that I was a girl, and merely written off as ""quiet"" (apparently it's only strange when little boys are ""quiet""). When I was around 14-16 (I forget the exact year), it was suggested to me by a friend with a severely autistic sister that I should do some research on Asperger's and high-functioning autism. Several years of reading about the syndrome and testimonies from those who had it led me to believe I too was an aspie (for various irrelevant personal reasons I chose not to seek an official diagnosis...that's a whole other issue). 

Because of the revelation that I arrived at, I found that as my teen years went on I became much more aware of my autistic-like behaviors and was able to better teach myself various social rules and behaviors that vastly improved my ability to make friends and calm myself better in situations where I felt anxious (I still have a long way to go on that score!) Now, as an adult who has successfully navigated three years of college, many people I meet, if the subject of my Asperger's somehow comes up or if I choose to trust them with the information, are skeptical, and seem not to believe me, presumably because I have improved my social skills and lessened the intensity of my tics, etc. to the point where I seem mostly ""normal"" to people.

I am not ashamed of how I am. I was born this way, and this is how I'm always going to be. However, I find it insulting and rude when someone with whom I entrust this information expresses doubt that I have Asperger's. In the cases to which I'm referring the people had no medical or psychological background, in most cases had never met a person with Asperger's before, and seemed to believe that because I don't act like Rain Man or Sheldon Cooper, I must not ""really"" have autism or Asperger's. These people cannot see into my brain and have no idea what it is like to be me. In most cases these have been friends who have only seen me interact with people in situations where I feel comfortable, and have never seen how I react to social anxiety or pressure. They did not know me as a child, when my symptoms were more pronounced. Even if this is explained to them, they seem to think writing me off as ""just a little strange"" is the proper diagnosis. I think this may have something to do with the fact that I'm self-diagnosed, or just general ignorance about high-functioning individuals with Asperger's, or both. Has anyone else experienced similar problems? How have you handled it? What's a good strategy for me to approach this? Am I doing the right thing by avoiding the topic and not telling people anymore?

Almost in an instant, everything clicked. Everything made sense.  

“I have Asperger’s.”  

With those three simple words, a wave of emotions comes rolling over me, one after the other. First comes relief. Relief that I’m not screwed up in the head. That so many of my failures up to this point have a logical and consistent explanation.  

Relief that so many mysteries are no longer mysterious. There were questions that I had carried with me all my life, never finding their full expression but always lurking in the background. Questions like “Why do I make new friends at a rate that makes the [pitch drop experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment) seem like a monsoon? And why do I never talk to most of the friends that I *do* have? When other people talk about their problems, I can’t relate. When other people talk about their plans, I can’t relate. When other people talk about their identity, whether it’s their country, hometown, ethnicity, religion or whatever it is, I can’t relate. Why the **fuck** am I so different from everyone else? Is it because I’m smart? Is it because of my parents / upbringing? Is it just because I’m an asshole?” *No. In fact, being smart is one trait which allowed you to adapt and try to fit in, awkwardly, for 23 long years. No, you’re different because your brain is different. And you’re not an asshole.*  

Before I thought I might have ADHD, OCD, depression and on and on. There were so many labels and so few answers. But now I finally have the real answer.  

Next comes regret. Regret that I didn’t learn about this sooner. I always knew I was different, but didn’t have any idea why or how. Now that I have discovered the why and the how, I can’t help but wonder how much of my life could have been different if only I had known. So many situations that ended badly, from the most meaningless social interaction to the most critical task, whose result now seems as predictable and inevitable as getting wet after jumping into a pool. If I had known, I could have realized what was going on, and made adjustments. How much more could I have accomplished up to this point? Later, while reading the Wikipedia article titled [Asperger Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome), I would feel like I was reading a list of all my traits. Socially awkward. “Check.” Often focuses on small details, while missing the big picture. “Check.” May not express emotions readily. “Check.” May be physically uncoordinated and have poor visuospatial reasoning. “Check.” May have repetitive gestures such has hand-flapping. “Wait, you mean that weird thing I always do where I flap my hands is a sign of AS? Well, *motherf...* Check.” After some reflection, and looking at the bright side, I don’t have every symptom imaginable. For example, sensory overload doesn’t affect me too badly. Food is very important to me, and I honestly can’t imagine life as a picky eater. *Seriously? It seems like you’ve read half of Wikipedia, and* this *is the one article you chose to skip? You’re truly a dumbass sometimes.*  

Next up is pride. Pride in myself that I made it this far, despite being different and despite not knowing why. Pride in my friends, who have managed to like me despite my differences. Pride that I succeeded in many situations where my AS could have caused me to fail. I also realize that a fair bit of luck was involved as well, in that I was exposed to many people who were receptive to my unfamiliar personality. This knowledge, as well as the knowledge that I have a very supportive family, would soon temper my pride with a dash of humility. *Yeah! You fucking rock, man! Wait, did I really just say that?*  

And then, as the burst of emotion (a rare enough experience) starts to fade away, I’m left with a sense of anticipation. I look around me. The world still looks the same, with the same colors, shapes, sounds, and the same people who seem so different from me. And yet, this world around me now feels a bit gentler. A bit less mysterious. Is my life going to improve dramatically, right off the bat? Not likely. I tend to live in a fantasy world, where all of the talents I have (and some that I don’t) are expressed simultaneously, to their greatest extent. Before, I thought this tendency was a defect in my character. Now I see it for what it is: the uglier side of AS. But AS has a brighter side as well. And learning about it has given me one more reason to be hopeful about the real world. *Great, you’ve figured it out.

My wife is flying in tonight and lands at 11pm.  Last time i used my friends car to pick her up, i tried to be calm but stressing about using my friends car and the late hour ended in a disaster where all my energy went in driving and 0 to force a good mood to hang with her.  

Her alternative is to use a cab to get home and either charge it to her company or heck, i'll pay for it

My plan this time around was to use that energy to clean the house (makes her happy) and be happy when i saw her despite how shitty and alone i feel.  And now im selfish because i'd rather that than pick her up.

Im at a loss and feel really sad.  If i know going to the airport stresses me out and her alternative is to take a care, is it her just not getting it, despite my explaining it to her? Should i disregard the inevitable meltdown and do it anyway?

The most recent episode i've had was today at work, i have started working in another ""section"" at the same place - everything's just fine and dandy and i quite like it so that's not a problem. The only problem is that when i get into new places where i'm not too familiar with routines etc(but it has also happened in other situations too) i get stuck.

It's hard to explain, sometimes it feels like a mental block where i just can't... i dunno... find something to do? Like today at work when me and my colleagues finished a task... then they just started on some other stuff without including me in them, which really is no problem at all since too many chefs cooking a soup will spoil it or whatever, but that left me kind of dumbstruck and i just stood there and in a bit of internal panic trying to find something to do which for me seems incredibly hard since i'm new and not familiar with the routines. 

One thing led to another and a few minutes later one colleague actually said to me ""don't just stand there glaring, do something, get started on something new"" in a irritated voice(at least so it seemed to me even if it might be hard to judge peoples voice sometimes). That is EXACTLY what the fuck i was trying to do but i just couldn't find anything while they just started on stuff right away which if i would have looked at those stuff i wouldn't have found anything to do with them. Then the other colleague told me to do this and that which made sense to me and everything went fine after that.

In short i guess the actual problem is that i sometimes have a hard time getting started on and with stuff until someone gives me some actual instructions. It was almost the exact same thing for me in school at times with homework, classwork, assignments and whatever... i could not get started until someone helped me get started and once that was done it wouldn't be a problem anymore.

I've already grown to the thought that he is ""the one"" and I am so excited to continue to progress in our relationship. We are extremely open about everything. He is my best friend. It almost makes it a positive that he is harder to understand and read his social cues and to understand mine because we communicate a lot more.

Please help me understand what's going on in my husband's head, and how I can encourage him to pursue a diagnosis.

I started having such feelings around the age of 13, and they lasted up until I was 16, which is apparently very rare. I still experience feelings of unreality, but rarely, whereas I used to be facing these experiences from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep (where it would be on my mind all day, too). 

In most cases, derealisation is brought on by stress or trauma, although I never had an exceptional event of either, yet had it chronically for three years. I am wondering; could this be linked to my Aspergers? Such as...could a lack of empathy lead to a lack of reality in the mind?

Had a couple breakthroughs.,25,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/zof2t/a_follow_up_from_a_few_days_ago_27f_and_her_aspie/," [I made this post a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/zkzza/it_was_suggested_that_i_post_this_here_i_really/).  I just want to follow up.

After some really good talks with my husband over the last 48 hours, we feel we have a much better understanding of each other.  I've come to a couple conclusions that have helped.  

1)   I have been trying to make him one kind of a husband.  But he is an Aspie husband.  And I need to make him the best THAT that he can be.  I also need to change my behaviour to help change his.  

2)  I want ""planned spontaneity.""  We went for a good walk today and I said, ""Did you realize that every time I walk by this bakery, I buy you a cookie because I know you love these cookies more than any other in the world?""  He said, ""Huh!  No, I didn't!  I went on, ""You know how I buy you books on amazon or whatever just because I think you'd like them and then surprise you?""  ""Yeah,"" he agreed.  ""Well, doing little things like that for you is a way that I show and receive love.  It's something I need.  Will you make a point of doing one thing like this for me per week?""  He happily complied!  

3)  This is a big one.  I have to let certain things go and compromise about others.  For example, he almost never initiates sex.  Naturally his libido seems to be less than mine, and he gets wrapped up in his pet projects and often takes my advances as an intrusion on his work.  ""Sex?  Like, now?  Can't you see I'm trying to write a screenplay about a boy with a bionic brain whose town has been whisked away by aliens into to space and he must guide it using his superpowers while a power-obsessed principal rules the town with an iron hand?  My agent is waiting for this!!"".  We can go months without him initiating and it is a real sore spot between us.  It really makes me feel unloved.  

So, tonight, I tried something different.  He hates interruptions in his routine and I knew that tonight he would go to the gym.  If the right shorts and tshirt aren't there, if he hops in the shower after and comes out to find there is no towel on the rack because it is in the dryer (he would never think to look BEFORE he left) he gets so grumpy and huffy.  Even for the rest of the night.

So, tonight, I gathered his gym clothes and made sure everything was in it's proper place.  I went downstairs with his clothes and said, ""I, because I am so nice ;), have brought you your gym clothes!  I also made sure there was clean underwear in your drawer and a dry towel on the rack!""  He looked at me with such affection that I was startled.  

Shortly after, I said, ""It's OK if you say no, but do you wanna have sex tonight?""  ""Sure!""  he said.  ""Before or after you go to the gym?"" I asked.  ""Ummm, after, "" he said.  ""OK, so that's around 8:30.  You'll finish your work for your agent and then go to the gym before that?""  ""Yup!"" he said.  ""OK!"" I replied.  ""I'll see you at 8:30.

And, like magic, it came together and he showed up happily at 8:30 on the dot :)  

I am going to stop looking for him to initiate.  That is not a way he shows love.  He shows love by SHOWING UP.  And I know that if he doesn't want to do something, he doesn't do it.  If he doesn't like you, he doesn't hang out with you.  If he doesn't want to go to a party, he doesn't show up.  I am going to focus on creating an environment that is positive in the ways he needs so he can feel comfortable enough to respond to my advances.  He's just not going to be the initiator, so I will compromise.  

4)   I will feed the professor.  Aspie people absorb knowledge of their pet subjects.  This is a man who writes academic styled essays about little know and dreadful B movie directors like Coleman Francis.  (I am not even making this up.)  And he does it simply for the joy of writing and expressing his passions.  He is not a student.  He is not published anywhere.  He gets of on sharing knowledge and helping people to see and understand the world. A natural professor who finds sharing and expanding other's minds a joy.  

I will feed this instead of resist this.  As we made love tonight, I was, ahem, including a vibrator in our interactions.  And he said, as we are in the midst of sex, ""I was reading and interesting article today about the history of the vibrator....blah blah blah.....developed by medical doctors...blah blah...girl orgasms are weird, etc.""  Usually, I would get ticked off and say, ""I don't wanna talk about this NOW.""  But instead, I sad, ""The female orgasms is very interesting.  Have you ever heard about the theory of 'upsuck'?  It's the idea that....blah blah.""  With the Professor fed, sex happily resumed!

*There are a lot of other things I plan to change on my part.  I'm not letting him off the hook, I'm just trying to make life comfortable in the way he needs it so he is free to say ""yes"" to me more.*

**I am ""new"" at this though we've been married 8 years.  I hope my plan works, because I really want our relationship to work.  Tonight, I feel hopeful!

I imagine that there are more than a few ""grammar Nazis"" in our midst. For me, contending with grammatical or syntactic imprecision is part of my job. (I teach composition and I do a lot of editing. Patience is part of the job description.) However, I do do have problems with certain common expressions. Some of these are expressions that I have simply picked up unconsciously and used in the past, but I try to be conscious of when I use them. For instance, I am well aware that when a person says ""How are you?"" that her question is not meant as an invitation to an impromptu therapy session. At the same time, I am cautious of using ""How are you?"" because I want to reserve that question when I am genuinely curious about how that person is doing. 

Along these same lines, one expression that I have become wary of, is the word ""just,"" as in ""I just want a slice of your pizza."" That word has become a warning signal for me.

Roughly speaking, ""just"" is meant to signify ""only"" or ""no big deal."" When someone says ""I just want..."" we are supposed to gladly agree to that person's demands. Sometimes, it truly is not a big deal and we'd be petty not to acquiesce: ""I have been on my feet all day and I just want to sit down for a couple of minutes.""

On the other hand, these ""just"" users ask too much of us and are quite unjust in their demands. As when, for instance, a person makes a breach of reasoning: ""I don't mean to stereotype; I just want to point out that this is something I've noticed about your people."" or when this person, like an unwelcome houseguest, makes an imposition that may truly be uncomfortable for us: ""I just want to offer a few words in prayer…"" In the first instance, the person may sidestep the awkwardness of having to apologize. After all, he didn't mean to offend; he ""just"" meant to make a claim without having to submit it to too much scrutiny. In the second instance, the would-be petitioner does not mean to overlook that you're an atheist or of another religion; she simply wishes to make a public appeal in mixed company on behalf of a belief system that she thinks is superior to your own.

We, of course, are supposed to ""shrug it off,"" but as the saying goes, ""Give a person and inch and he'll take a mile."" Even so, that little word ""just"" has the effect of making any person who would raise an objection seem like a petty tyrant.

I am 27 years old, and I was given the fantastic news a couple days ago that I have a family of individuals that think and feel as I do: all of you. I have been thinking of nothing but how we are similar, how we are different, what separates us from NTs, and what we all share since I rediscovered my heart after finding you, and I have come to a number of conclusions and ideas on which I would be so incredibly happy to receive your feedback.

The first seems self-evident: under the right set of circumstances, we have the focus and drive of demi-gods. These powers seem to be undervalued by not only most NTs, but by ourselves, as well.

The second is that our social skills are viewed in a damning, counter-productive light. They are seen from the perspective of those that don't understand us, and cannot yet help but to see us as deficient. I assert that if we were all identified early, and then introduced into a solid community of self-aware spectrum people, social skills would never present a problem, because we would then be permitted to go about our lives in ways that make sense to us, that work for us. With a framework in place to discover what this would actually look like, the freedoms and fluidity that so terribly few of us are now afforded in the world would come as naturally as the seasons.

The third, and perhaps most important, is that too many of us allow ourselves to be pathologized and made small, as what other option is there when those interested in helping us (assuming with a burning heart for sake of argument that all of the professionals that study us have our best interests in mind) are forced to look around the problem - through the veil, so to speak. They cannot know how our minds function; they are not us! They can only take note of patterns and ways that we diverge from the rest of the human population. And let's face it, patterns are not exactly an NT strong suit  : )

This is not the way! It seems evident to me that we need to have intense dialogue among ourselves to discover how we want and need to be treated, how we want and need to live and love and learn and grow together, how we can serve ourselves, and through this effort, the world.

I understand some of the difficulties, but I am very new to our splintered, fragmented tribe. I need to find others who share my passion and my drive to create a new dawn for both us and for a world that so desperately needs massive change in almost every way conceivable to most effectively and efficiently serve all of us.

My dreams are currently two-fold: 

1.) For all of us to become supremely confident in ourselves to the point that it becomes unthinkable for us to fail to constantly be aware of what we do well and how incredibly powerful we all are, and to problem-solve our collective and individual challenges to the point that for every one of them we have a way of effectively turning them into strengths. This process, if committed to with the drive and focus that we all seem to share when not bogged down by the frustrations of living in this world made alien to us, would create a strong, vibrant community that would allow us to not only survive - trying to hang curtains in our individual prison cells - but to thrive!

2.) To create centers of learning and study that are specifically tailored to these new ways of understanding ourselves that would allow us to bravely engineer a new reality for our planet. New systems of governance and management with social principles and justices in place that would gain the support of the entire lay-population, that would dispense with the majority (or possibly, the entirety?) of the pain and frustration that causes us to choose to think of ourselves as different and separate, rather than a single people. New ways of envisioning our existence and ways of moving about it by combining our individual studies of science, philosophy, mathematics, art and expression, et al, into one unprecedented, unified body of connection-making and forward-thinking superheroes.

I think we are all of us sleeping X-Men. I think we are all of us powerful beyond measure. I know that this is an attainable future. One day I want a pronouncement of autism or Asperger's to turn heads and drop jaws, because it will correctly be viewed as an indication that here stands a person of significant worth, who after learning to unlock his/her/it's/their genius, will very likely leave the world bettered in their wake.

All,

The letters are tremendous, and the calls are having an impact. Please keep it up...letters and phone calls. And if this will really effect you; if your child is at risk of losing their education funding, if you or a loved one are at risk of losing housing, health, or employment services; or if you're simply a fellow spectrumite who worries about having your behavioral differences lumped back into the category of personal defect rather than wiring . . .

 . . . then maybe it's worth it to call every day?

Once again you can contact the American Psychiatric Association by calling 703.907.7300 or by emailing dsm5@psych.org and apa@psych.org.

Three updates:

1. We're working on a petition that, once announced, will really need your help in circulating. Thank you in advance for whatever help you can give herein.

2. There has been some confusion over Dr. Fred Volkmar's quotes in the original NYTimes article that started this whole thing. This was somewhat inevitable because of the way his quotes were placed within the context, and . . . because sarcasm is simply something that we don't pick up at times. But his ""epidemic"" quote was sarcasm. Remember that Volkmar resigned his position on the DSM-5 Committee.

3. In your letters, a couple of times there has been some confusion over which proposed changes are the new ones we're protesting. Two years ago the proposed changes surrounded terminology—doing away with Asperger's Syndrome and PDD-NOS and having them combined with autism under a much broader diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Feel free to write about your feelings on this, but understand that these are not the latest developments. The latest changes surround restricting the criteria so that multitudes of people will lose their diagnosis. Check our facebook page for prior day-by-day developments if you need the older posts for refresher info.

Thanks again y'all. More later.

I apologize if this ends up unreadable. Also, it's really, really long. So I apologize for that too.

Due to the fact that I live right next to a main road, and right next to a river, it has been unusually noisy lately. (Sirens, cars, horns, kids chatting, helicopters for the fires, ect) This has caused me to flip out almost every single day for the last like, two weeks. Today I nearly dreaded getting up out of bed because that was practically too much.

I've also been out in public a lot lately. That means that running and hiding in the bathroom is significantly harder. *Why is that girl running to the bathroom all the time, what's wrong with her?*

Yesterday I walked into my church. We've been doing some redecorating. It's been the same for the last 30 years, and now they're changing many things at once. There was a figure on the wall that I thought would remain on the wall. Sometime yesterday it was taken down. 

I lost it. Most of my meltdowns are relatively minor and can be dealt with a few short breaths. Not this one. I started sobbing, and nearly fell to the floor. (God I wish I was exaggerating) I ran to the closest bathroom, and it still took a good five minutes to calm down enough to go back out into the (empty) church. When I walked back outside, my pastor was standing talking to some guys, and greeted me. And I started crying again. I managed to say hello in this weird tweaked out voice that didn't sound like me at all. 

It was quite embarrassing. The most frustrating part was that I had no idea how to get a grip on my emotions again. I grew up in a family where crying was severely looked down upon, because it was too immature. (I grew up in a fucked-up family, what can I say) 

I really am not sure how to handle (any) emotions. Do I let them out? Do I bottle them? What can I do if I can't flee to the nearest bathroom to ""cry it out""? Are there any good excuses for suddenly bursting into tears for no reason whatsoever? What about the anger ones? They've gotten worse now that the triggers are more frequent. One of these days I'm going to slip and actually throw the glass at the wall. I know aspies aren't violent, and I never get angry outside of these little...whippersnappers. (I know that's not what that word means, but it's a good mental image)

I'm mostly concerned because I'll be going back to school soon. I'm taking two classes, one in the morning and one at night. I'm also teaching two classes about my savant interest. I feel I might have piled too much on my plate. Obviously, in both (or really, all four) of these situations I cannot just flee the room and chill out.

I was sitting in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere Idaho in a cabin full of crazies varying from schizophrenics and ex-coke addicts to others like myself who were high functioning Aspies wondering where the hell they were. 

Now in my parents defense, I had just been suspended from college for an academic violation, however in my defense that violation was the result of being black mailed by a very sour ex-girlfriend, who in my parents defense led me into a pretty deep depression(not like suicide bad but dark nonetheless) that was one of the main reasons they sent me off. 

It seems kind of like a nightmare at this point (like being in an intellectual prison and real one at the same time) and I am not sure truly what help I got from there, however I do know that I somehow came out (be it growing older and more mature or just me never wanting to end up in that hell-hole again idk) at least slightly more high functioning. 

I promptly got into a new college and then joined a fraternity after becoming one of the more popular new people on campus....

and then well I kinda lost it all. I tell myself it was on purpose, small school = lots of gossip + high popularity = getting gossiped about + social anxieties = an unhappy me. (came precariously close to accidentally inserting my name there) So I ended up kinda secluding myself last year. I dropped my fraternity (which I had proudly joined originally as a sort of badge of social success) and started spending most of my time at home. It was just simply too much to handle. 

I look back at the experience today and have trouble finding any positive that came out of it. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

As such, I've attempted to do things that maybe make me a phony because when people asked me what my interests are I have no good answer and thought it would be best just to make my friends' interests mine.

So, my parents divorced when I was around ten and had me see a psychologist because I had difficulty coping with the change. Turns out I was diagnosed with AS when I went in for that. Looking back it makes sense now because much of the conversations were about me and not how I feel about my parents but rather interests, things I like, and we even played video games when we were done talking after our sessions and now I feel I was being watched even more.

My mom drives to my apartment and finally tells me.

I asked to speak with the consular outside and I told him ""you are telling me I'm one of them? That doesn't make any sense"" and I left.

Anyways, I have some traits that seem much like the symptoms of Asperger's, but I'm not sure. I don't know if I want to be diagnosed, though. I'm not sure how I feel about this in general, but I am very interested in what you guys think.

Here are some traits I have that I think seem like Asperger's:

I hate talking to people I'm not already comfortable with. Certain people bother me to the point of going out of my way to avoid them, for almost no real reason. I am not usually uncomfortable with saying something in class, but it takes a lot of rehearsal in my head to get my words out right. I literally repeat the same sentence a dozen times in my head until it's time to say it, otherwise I don't feel prepared. 

I have serious sensory issues. Certain textures really bother me. For example, I can't eat chicken strips because they're not uniform texture and I'm afraid I will feel something I wasn't expecting.

I fidget a lot, often picking at my face and eyebrows because the texture bothers me and doesn't feel right. I have created some toys for myself to keep myself from destructive fidgeting. I also have motor and vocal ticks such as rolling my tongue and making a noise for no reason, or making a weird noise when I feel a certain way and there's nothing to say.

I often have trouble moving, especially around things. If I'm moving too fast, I lose a sense of spatial awareness and often trip or run into something. I also drop things a lot because I don't hold them tightly enough.

I have problems saying what's on my mind. I usually can't understand or describe my feelings. When telling a story, I usually interrupt myself and interject things, and the story usually doesn't follow an comprehensible pattern of speech unless I plan it ahead of time for a while. I also stutter and talk way too fast when trying to say something. 

I have very focused interests for fairly short periods of time. For example, I will be really interested in snakes for a couple of days, or research bands I don't even listen to much.

I'm more of a computer operator/help desk, so my responsibilities include not only answering whatever support questions come in by phone or email, but also monitoring our servers and making sure everything is running. 

I've been told this job has about a 6 month learning curve, which didn't scare me much going into it because I usually pick things up a lot faster than others. It has been about a month now and I still feel completely lost, and I am the only person on my shift, which means if I need help I have to call someone that works first shift and bother them, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. The helpdesk tickets seem to come in in spurts. I can sit here for 6 hours happily watching the servers with nothing coming in and 0 stress, but then 5 tickets come in at once and I go into panic and it ruins my whole night. I've had many nights where I just wanted to log out and leave and never come back.

I've spent my entire career being the person other people come to for help with difficult problems, and now I feel like a fucking incompetent moron. I have Xanax in case my anxiety gets too bad, but it makes me  a little too loopy sometimes and I try not to take it.

To be fair, I was a really weird kid. I'm pretty high functioning now, but when I was in grade school, I ate my boogers, I talked to myself, I would go off by myself and pretend to be a power ranger at recess, kicking and punching the air. I would always sing to myself. When I was a kid, I didn't realize how weird these things were, I was being bullied, but I didn't understand why these things weren't ok. Even into middle school, I kept up some of these behaviors. When I was in High school, I still sang to myself all the time without realizing how it looked. I had a hard time connecting with my peers. My parents were supportive, they were loving, but when I was a kid, my sisters would always torment me, worse than most of my peers. If you had asked me when I was younger, pretty much up to the time I was 16, I would say I hated my sisters. It took a long time for our relationship to repair, and I still feel like, at least with my younger sister, it hasn't fully been repaired.

Hearing that my sisters were teased was a huge revelation to me. I usually don't like to think about the way I was when I was a kid, because I feel ashamed of the way I was. I am still struggling to get by in an NT world without betraying my true self, but I know that the way I was when I was young was not right, and I understand why I was bullied now. But hearing that my sisters were going through the same thing for something that wasn't their fault makes me feel horrible. I can understand now why they acted the way that they did around me. To some degree, I think they did want me to change for my own sake, but they thought of me as an embarrassment, an obstacle in their own lives. I don't think in those circumstances I could just expect them to be understanding of our differences.

Another thing I realized is that they were jealous of the attention my parents were giving me. My parents put a lot of effort into trying to socialize me (for which I am grateful) because they knew that I wouldn't think to do it on my own. I think my older sister, because of her age, was able to understand these things better. I know that my little sister would always tell me she hated me because I was our parents' favorite, which wasn't true, but she thought that because I was getting more attention that I was.

1339621473.0,16,self.aspergers,v0gxi,Is it possible to have Asperger's yet pick up on most social cues? Or is my therapist right in instantly dismissing my concerns?,21,5,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/v0gxi/is_it_possible_to_have_aspergers_yet_pick_up_on/,"Prelim info: I'm 21, female, in university, and living away from family. And this wall of text is going to be a nightmare to read and I also hope that I don't offend anyone with what I say (I'm honestly not a malicious person, I just don't know what's polite or not).

Long story short, I've been in counseling for about a month (not that long, I know) to try to address a LOT of issues from ~20 years of family abuse and a very unhealthy childhood. I've always suspected I was on the autism spectrum, particularly Asperger's, but I never really pursued treatment until now, seeing a therapist regularly and the fact that I am performing incredibly poorly in school. I talked with my therapist yesterday and brought in [this paper](http://www.help4aspergers.com/pb/wp_a58d4f6a/images/img244154ad237783e339.JPG), where I had circled about 77% of the traits as characteristic of me. I had also taken several quizzes online, including a very in-depth one whose name I've forgotten (it's the one that produces a 14-page .pdf of your results and analysis) and scored an Aspie score of 156/200. I took that test after the therapist appointment, so I didn't show her that.

Long story short, she looked at the one sheet I brought in and said that she doesn't think I have Asperger's because I pick up on social cues. I can communicate and pick up social cues well, but I do have an above-average Aspie social score and a below-average NT social score, and I get bad social anxiety and much prefer being by myself. I did grow up very close to my family, so I think that's how I learned a lot of social skills (yes a weird oxymoron in that I have an unhealthy childhood but was close to my family...I didn't realize that it was an unhealthy upbringing until just recently and I haven't totally cut off my family). And I was very much into online gaming so I learned a lot of cues from the conversations there as well. I didn't think that it was a ""requirement"" for all Aspies to have poor social skills (and I apologize if I offend anyone who matches this description, I honestly don't meant to hurt people's feelings) but I feel that I match up in a lot of the other aspects of it.

My therapist suggested that I am just going through a form of PTSD. I do agree with that because I can trigger so badly, but I also know that these Aspie-type issues have been going on for much longer, as I just started triggering recently, but I have always exhibited the Aspie tendencies which are concerning me now. Is it possible to have both and right now they're just getting muddled up with each other? I've also had severe depression issues in the past.

The reason I would like a formal diagnosis is because I am doing very, very, *very* poorly in my engineering classes, as in borderline flunking out, and it would be nice to be able to work with the learning center here on campus to overcome my difficulties in my classes. I exhibit a lot of [point #3](http://www.lbctnz.co.nz/sld/aspergers/educating.html) in this article and I quite honestly don't know how to fix this on my own and, like I said, I don't even know if I'll be able to graduate next spring. I would like to access the support center on campus to work specifically on learning strategies geared towards my personal issues so hopefully I can do well. I also want to go to grad school after my bachelor's, but my GPA right now is so poor, so it would be nice to try to fix that before applying to grad school so I could show that I am able to learn, just with the right methods.

My therapist said that if I don't improve in a few months, I can do learning disability testing. My problem is that, honestly, I don't have a few months to wait and see if it gets any better. I'm already struggling in my summer classes and this final year, starting in August, is not going to get any better. I know that everything takes time, but I seriously don't want to go through another hellish semester while wondering if this PTSD/depression counseling will help my learning incapability.

I'm 23 years old and I've never had a girlfriend. When I was younger I was simply too shy to talk to girls. This changed as I got a little older. Sadly back then I thought that was the only issue. I was also naive enough to believe that if you asked a girl out and she said ""yes"" that meant you were going on a date.

For the past four years I've been very bold with approaching girls and people have complemented me for it. It isn't hard for me to get a girls phone number or her facebook page. The only problem is the next step. In the past I used to be given fake phone numbers a lot so I came up with a strategy where I tell her to let me call her so she can get my number to. Almost always a girl doesn't answer her phone or respond to a text message. I thought using facebook would be more casual and less ""threatening"" to a girl but almost always they accept my friend request but never respond if I try to talk to them. Many situations are really bizarre such as me meeting a girl and we have some unusual interests in common and seem to really connect, only to be ignored by her later. Last week I met a girl and we had coffee together in our university twice. The second time I asked if she wanted to hang out sometime and she said yes. She did respond to a text saying we should do something but never did when I said where and when. This was a few days ago. This is one of hundreds of examples of many similar situations that don't make any sense. I feel as though I have the rare super power of being able to answer a phone or respond to a text message. I am planning to see another girl this Saturday but I'm not going to count on it (it wouldn't surprise me if she does what all the rest do). I'm at the point where I can't trust anyone.

I fell like the only person in the world where getting a girls phone number or making plans is actually a sad situation. As soon as something like that happens I feel bad because I just know she is going to do what the rest do. It's almost as if I'm handed a bomb and I need to defuse it and one wrong move and there is an explosion.

Up until a few months ago I thought the problem was being a virgin. I was obsessed with wanting to get rid of the awful v word and people told me that was my problem. I only told people about my curse if I was very close to them however I felt girls could sense it somehow and thought I was a freak. A few months ago I received pity sex from a female friend and I felt like I escaped a concentration camp. I knew things were going to get better and I had a ""fuck buddy."" Well the sex time period was short (she got a boyfriend so we had to stop (we are still friends though)) and as time went on I realized that wasn't the only problem. Besides being not obsessed with ""when will it end"" everything else isn't that different. I'm still in pretty much the same situation with women.

What really bothers me is I work with a girl who if it weren't for the fact she were in a relationship I would ask her out. Her boyfriend is a complete scumbag and according to her, he ""used to be"" abusive but she ""changed"" him (I'm skeptical to believe this). Seeing situations such as this (I've seen plenty of others) make me furious because I would never do anything close to that but I can't get a girlfriend. This problem of not finding a woman has caused me to get severe envy issues and it is almost impossible for me to be friends with another straight man (very few exceptions) but this isn't as bad as it used to be since I had sex.

I'm sick and tired of all the same advice. Can someone tell me something I haven't heard that can help me? Can someone help me end the perpetual hell of false hope?

I prefer computers to human interaction. School assignments are difficult to juggle, and it only gets worse when you add the pressure of society. I wish I lived in a video game, where everything made sense. Also, I act like a freak sometimes.** 


Hey, r/Aspergers. Like most of us here, I don't have the best social life. In fact, I barely have a social life when you compare it to the lives of my peers. While other's go out to party and hang out with friends, I stay in the safety of my home and hang out with my computer (which isn't half bad, considering all the incredible games and websites out there, but you know what I'm getting at). 

I'm currently 15 years old. High school status. At the time where your popularity points start to become more important, and if you aren't like the masses, you'll end up befriending similar people who don't exactly ""fit in"" either. Which isn't a bad thing in my opinion. My two close friends both love computers as I do, and things that others would consider ""nerdy"" or ""weird"" are often the main points of our conversations. They don't have Aspergers, they're as NT as the other kids in my school. But they understand and respect me, as I do to them. When I told them about my condition, they continued to be the best of friends, and not once have they looked down on me.

I know other people who are still good friends, but they tend to be a bit more demanding of me social-wise, as they tend to attract the more popular crowds. To be honest, I don't see why someone would ever want to be popular. I mean, it all sounds like a lot of pointless work, trying to be someone you're not just to appeal to a certain audience. Why should I lose a part of me just to fit in? I'd rather stay who I am then lose my soul to some group of idiots. 

Now, I don't mean to lump all the popular kids into one stereotype. But I've seen it everywhere. Walking down the halls, in the classroom. I hear it. I hear their conversations. They think I'm oblivious to everything around me (which I am in some ways), but I hear everything. I can hear the intense social demands of today's generation. Everything from staying informed on the latest gossip, to the slang terms and dirty jokes that just go beyond me. I see people talking in groups, laughing. I hear something being said, something that appears so innocent to me, and yet the entire group of people suddenly become offended. 

I don't understand it. I don't understand what it was that offended them. Sometimes I wonder if I'm completely oblivious to conversational norms, or NT's are just really sensitive. Either way, I tend to avoid heavy conversations when speaking to people other than my small group of friends. Mostly just simple hellos when necessary. In fact, I don't usually talk to ""outsiders"" at all, really. About 95% of my day is spent with my two best friends. Which suits me just fine. 

At least they don't think I'm weird. Most of the people I see don't understand me. They jump to conclusions. People mock me as I walk down the halls. Not always, but every so often I overhear them snickering as I walk by.

I don't think I even did anything to deserve such embarrassment. Well, I won't lie, I can almost understand the reasoning behind their mockery. If I'm in a hurry to get to class, I'll often run (or at least fast-walk) down the halls. But no, apparently those who move faster than the masses are fools, and should be treated accordingly. Whenever I run down the halls, I get these weird looks as if I just did something horribly wrong; almost as if I were going mad. I don't understand it. Is running really that big of a deal? At least I won't be late. 

That's something I don't get about society. People have tons of issues that could be fixed with simple, logical solutions (such as running in a public place to avoid being late. Makes sense, right?). But people get all caught up in making sure they don't look foolish in front of their peers. They want to make sure they don't break any social rules, so they basically throw away logic and replace it with these stupid rules and regulations.

Anyway, as I was saying, I can see why they would ridicule me. I've noticed a few things about me recently. In a situation with 1-2 people, I interact just fine. But add in more people, and instantly I'll go from being semi-normal to being completely alien to the rest of them. It's like my brain freaks out and starts making stupid jokes and laughing at everything and suddenly acting so juvenile....it's very counter-productive in terms of not looking like a human freak.

School in itself is generally harder for me. I mean, I understand what they're teaching. It's managing the multiple assignments from four different classes that gets me. I can manage with one, even two, but when I'm suddenly thrown a page of questions from one class, and a project in the other, all with different due dates, it gets complicated. It might not sound that bad to you, but even without the workload, my brain is constantly going everywhere. It wanders from topic to topic, sometimes even jumbling thought processes. It's chaotic at best, and adding the pressures of school and society only make it worse. I don't know if that's an AS thing or I'm just going insane.

Like I said before, my social life mostly consists of a few people, and my computer. I tend to lean towards the computer side more, meaning I'd gladly trade human interaction for the fastest computer in the world. Heck, I'd even trade for a half decent computer. As long as it plays all my favorite games. I don't know what I'd do without video games. They act as an escape. They let me enter another world, where I become the hero. A place where I can control everything around me. A place where everything runs as expected, with no sudden changes. Best of all, there are no real life people to get in my way. It's an entire world to myself. Games like Skyrim are good for this. Having a vast, open-concept map to explore and do whatever you want in is amazing. Sometimes I wish I could live in those fantasy worlds. Live alongside the NPCs I've come to know so well. Barter with familiar shopkeepers, and explore the realms with fellow adventurers. And of course, fight dragons. 

People don't really understand my relationship with games. Some think video games are juvenile. Some think they are a waste of time. They think my fantasies of living in the game worlds are childish and stupid. And I don't blame them. This is the world they belong in, so they can't imagine living anywhere else. But me, I don't feel like I belong here. I feel as if I belong elsewhere, so my dreams soar to fictional worlds and fantasy kingdoms. As long as I keep my dreams to myself, I should be fine.

Just curious to know if there are others who feel that music can somehow provide insight into their minds, and if so what songs really do it for you?

I'm a 26 year old with Asperger's who's been actively looking for a job for little over a year now and who's had over 70 face-to-face interviews already, but so far the search for a job has been nothing but frustrating.

Each time I think I'm finally getting the hang of social skills a little better, it's like some invisible force is grabbing me by the back of the head and slamming my face into a brick wall of reality. High school? Hell at first, but I grew into it. University? Skills learned at rural high school were totally inapplicable and it took a few years to learn a new way of acting to fit in. And now, ever since graduation, I'm looking how to fit into a new culture so to speak and I'm failing, badly.

Of course, the first few interviews I failed due to things many youngsters would fail: overestimating the importance of what you learned in college, thinking the world's at your feet, being a bit too idealistic etc. Fine, so far it's normal. But for me, the rejections kept coming despite a double MA, being trilingual, decent appearance and what I consider to be an honest and respectful character.

Numerous rejections later, I of course started to doubt my own abilities, especially my social skills. Every interviewer so far hasn't doubted any of my professional abilities, except the occasional ""team player"" aspect that some HR departments tend to overplay a little. But it's my personality that they dislike ... or better yet, it's what they perceive to be my personality in those 20min to 1hr interviews. First I'm too negative, too skeptic, too critical, too introvert... so when I try to be more positive, I'm suddenly not showing enough stress during interviews and I'm seen as too arrogant. I sincerely can not find the right way to appear to interviewers... The right amount of exterior enthusiasm, exterior confidence, it's so hard.

Sometimes I try to explain that I do have faith in my analytic skills, but that I do realize on the other hand I have to work on my soft skills still. However, they don't listen to my words and just go by what they perceive me to be, even if I directly explain to them that the way I act during interviews is just another way of coping.

Any tips?

ps: I have looked for lower qualification jobs, but I'm just overqualified for them. I'm in Europe and with labor laws here, it's sometimes more difficult to get hired on a temp basis because employers are incredibly risk-averse in that regard due to the high cost and effort of sending someone to the curb.",,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,,True,t3_qp858,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/qp858/the_job_hunt_mission_impossible/,

I'm thinking that if a book made me feel this happy (like happy tears, clapping happy!), then a diagnosis would really help. Any opinions on choosing a therapist or getting diagnosed?

1372356359.0,15,self.aspergers,1h6y8o,I wanted to understand why I was filled to the brim with anxiety and depression.,21,6,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1h6y8o/i_wanted_to_understand_why_i_was_filled_to_the/,"I wanted to understand why I was filled to the brim with anxiety and depression.  I wanted to know why I had a total meltdown two years ago and could not work any longer.  It was not the work it was the social interaction, it was dealing with other people.  Around 47 years old my wife and I where talking about me and my behaviors and both of us thought AS was a good fit for my personality.  I turn fifty this year.

A counselor (MFCC) suggests autism.  She thought asperger’s syndrome as a possible diagnosis.  I participated in multiple online tests.  The result being AS is a good start for a label, but I was not convinced at this point.

After finding some better tests and focusing on the subject I started to see how I might operate a brain on AS.  One more interesting thing about my wetware; I already operate a brain on dyslexia.  I am a psychologist’s wet dream.

I started to examine my mental behaviors, associated with my physical behaviors with the help of my wife and the word “meme.”  If people on AS fixate, focus with great intensity on a subject what was my fixation?  If we miss social interaction clues like facial expression what was I missing and if so what is my brain focused on when I miss your facial clues?  Why do I not imitate, mimic what we call “NT” behavior?  The last question was what the, is neurotypical?

I spent over 20 years functioning as they say “high” while performing chemical research in the biotech pharmaceutical industry.  I started a family, got divorced and then married my soul mate.  I am a lucky human to have found my mate and now my son from the first attempt has been living with us for years.  On the outside by all measures I was normal.  I also thought what was me was normal all along.  How does one flip their whole philosophical point of view of self from normal to abnormal?

I am well versed in the art of problem solving.  Research chemistry is all about problem solving.  This has been of great help to me as I processed the above questions to self diagnose.

What did I fixate on like a good AS person.  This took me months of self-examination to find the words (dyslexia issue) to describe my fixation.  All my life I felt something was not quite right.  Something was just off plum.  A splinter in the matrix as Morpheus says to Neo just before he chooses his future and eats the pill.  My pill was labeled asperger’s syndrome/dyslexia.  The splinter was thinking I was normal.  This was a 180-degree twist to my reality and a falling down the rabbit hole experience followed.  I had been fixated on understanding my environment and myself.  Then filtering all this data through the question why was there a splinter in my reality?

As a neophyte I spun, swirled, twisted down through all my wetware connections to reanalyze my whole life.  You see for almost 50 years all the experiencing I collected by memory was based in the wrong assumption.  I thought I was normal and it was not until reading the book “Pretending to be normal” for me to have this realization.   All the understanding I received from my experiencing for 50 years had been filtered through “normal” and now I was going to have to rehash my life without the normal filter and replace it with…what?  One hundred and eighty degree turn or what I call duality flipping.

I am still in the process of reorganizing my memories in a new light.  My memory is vast.  I recall my father talking with me at a young age saying, brains can have multiple files running while experiencing life and people.  The operator of the files can edit, turn on or off any number of files at any time.  At that time my young imagination took off on these ideas and I envisioned what it would be like at the age of 45.  I was so excited to see a library building extending into the distance.  My library is as vast as my imagining mind could see.

I had a mental library of experience, which can be edited, turned off and on and reorganized in real time.  I now operate a brain with uncanny memory and can remember words from conversations I had years ago.  My memories start at the age of three as confirmed by my parents when I describe the house we lived in during my toddler years.  Many hours of self-contemplation have filled the last two years of my life.

The last straw to convince me was my father’s words.  I wrote to him explaining AS and apologizing for my behavior, which has made our relationship difficult.  One sentence within his letter hit me hard, “I knew there was something off…we all did.”  My family thought my bad behavior was due to being an #@@#hole and not because my wetware was wired differently.  He followed up this sentence with “I just never had the sense to see it was not your fault.”  I am now convinced I operate a brain on AS and dyslexia.  I would be a great volunteer patient for studies of the brain.  Actually since the brain has been one of my fixations through out my life.  Being part of a study about the brain would be fascinating.

I'm pretty bad at recognising faces. I'm not sure, but I think it's worse when I haven't seen someone for a while (possibly because other changes in their appearance are more significant?). For example, I'm at university so I only see my mum every few months, and when I meet her at the station and she comes up to me I'm usually not quite sure whether it's her or just someone who looks like her until she gives me a hug. But then if I stay with her for a while, I'm more able to recognise her after the first day.

*Anyway*, I've been like this as long as I remember, so it doesn't usually bother me, but today there have been three incidents. Firstly, this morning my girlfriend got some new passport photos taken and she texted me a picture of them. The thing is... I didn't recognise her in the photo at all! I think it's because her glasses were off and her hair was brushed back more than normal... but this is a person I see all the time (even on days when I don't see her in person - I have a photo of her in my wallet and photos on my wall and she's usually my desktop background... so I see her face several times every day). I usually really like looking at photos of her, so it felt a bit sad that looking at this one felt a bit like ""who's that?"".

Then later on I was walking along and I thought I saw my friend (call him P). We were walking towards one another on the pavement and from the moment I spotted him until he was nearly next to me I was really sure it was P. I usually let other people make the first move in social situations (it just makes things easier), but P has been one of my best friends since we were 13 so I nearly called out his name and waved - but when we were really close, I realised he was a few inches too short to be P (and in hindsight he was a bit fatter too). P is taller than me, and this guy was shorter, but if it hadn't been for that, I would be sitting here wondering why he didn't say hi to me when I passed him. But this happens quite a lot, so it wouldn't be a big deal if it wasn't for the other incidents today.

Then I got to my room and looked on Facebook and my sister had posted some photos from some sort of event she went to with some friends. She isn't in most of them (I think she was taking the photos), but there's one picture which definitely has her in it... and one with just one girl, and I have been staring at it for ages and I can't tell at all whether it's her or one of her friends.

I know everyone sees unusual photos and doesn't recognise the person at first, or sees people who look like their friends, or sometimes has trouble identifying the person in a photo... and it happens to me every day, so I usually don't mind. But right now I feel like I can't recognise my *girlfriend*, my *best and oldest friend*, or my *sister*, and I kind of wish I didn't have a brain that works this way :(

Something that I've noticed while I've been journaling my own behaviour is that I feel a lot of empathy for other people. The only thing that makes me doubt that I might have asperger's is that sometimes people's facial expressions can heavily affect my emotions. For instance, the other day I saw a man crying and I immediately picked up on it and was almost brought to tears myself. In addition to that I intuitively respond to other people's smiles, and almost can't help myself from smiling when someone is genuinely smiling.

First time posting. I've been thinking a bit about routines, plans and structure and I'm wondering if NTs feel the same need for them. I wonder if they like routines, plans and structure as much as I do. I still don't know if I'm NT or not (though psychologists have told me it's very likely I've got AS) but I don't know any NTs who need routines etc like I do. Here are a few examples (emphasis on ""few"") of my routines and how I feel about plans etc: 

1. I have a morning routine which looks the same way every day. I do everything in the same order and with pretty much the same amount of time between the things I do. If I change it it feels wrong. Same goes for my routine before I go to bed at nighttime. 

2. I hate when other people change my plans. If they do and I don't think it's a good idea I get depressed, confused and I then have no idea what to do. It's like I don't know how to get through the day when something changes and my brain freezes when I think about the rest of the day. Can't get through the day as planned and then I feel like I might as well cancel all my other plans since everything has changed anyway, which means I often end up doing nothing on those days. I am, however, ok with changing plans myself since I have then chosen to do so (same goes for routines though I rarely change them). 

3. I've heard I'm a very inflexible and rigid person. I've heard most people are ok with being spontaneous. I'm not (with a few exceptions). If I don't plan things I don't get things done and if I don't plan things I get anxious. New places make me anxious. New people make me anxious. New environments make me anxious. 

4. I want and need to know all rules for all situations or I'll feel very anxious and unsafe. 

Like I said, these are just a few examples. So, what do you think? Do you think NTs are like this as well? There must be some NTs how have the same need for routines and plans, right?

I live in Hungary, I'm a university student, and work at an electronics store.

Two days ago my boss and a couple of mates stayed in after hours drinking and talking. After a couple of drinks, it somehow came up that whenever I am mentioned, my boss says that I am a little bit autistic but nice. Just like that. It turned out, basically all of my colleagues think I am autistic. A girl even said I must have aspergers.

So next morning I took the 50 question AQ test (it is a standard self-test, isn't it?), and I scored 34, which I think means I almost for sure I have aspergers.

I immediately called my girlfriend, who studies special needs education at the university, and she wasn't surprised at all. She used to say she suspects I have some minor disorder, but I never took her seriously.

To be fair, I did always have problems with my social skills. I never fit into any of the classes I had, and I still have fights with my family members. I often hurt people's feelings without the slightest intention. Also, I often have thoughts that others find very strange and weird.

Now I have far less conflicts with people than, say, three years ago and that is all thanks to my girlfriend, who took the time explaining me the problems she felt.

So, what should I do now? I don't even know if I can get myself diagnosed by a professional in Hungary, all the info online is valid for children, not adults. To be honest, I am quite satisfied with my life. 

Do you think getting an official paper would benefit me in any way? Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

* When somebody wants to share food, without clearly defining ""Mine"" and ""theirs"" i die a little.

* I can tell you word-for-word the conversations I've been in or overhead for a week, and losing detail steadily, going back about 6 months.

I'm trapped. I can't speak to anyone because they don't really understand, they try, but I'm either crazy, begging for attention or exaggerating. I will work in this endless cycle, this never-ending loop of work and sleep, and die alone.

Err, before I continue; I find retaining low-context alphanumeric strings no more difficult than the names of brand fizzy drinks. Final note: this is meant to describe stuff, the egocentric overtones of self-referencing are difficult to abolish. I aplogise in advance.

That which goes forward also goes in reverse: It turns out that once I've visualised a number or string it is available in reverse with equivalent ease.

Protecting that which probably doesn't need protecting: With the information readily available it isn't a huge leap to apply simple encryption (err, encryption is possibly a bit strong a term), such as shifting each character by a set amount (offsets adhere to mod 62 (alphanumeric character set size)). For example: ""aBZ"" shifted 1 place would be ""bC0"". Not necessarily practical but a neat and straightforward trick.

Protecting that which probably doesn't need protecting that which probably doesn't need protecting: Having established an encryption method it seems only natural to consider applying an encryption rule that feeds from (perhaps even recursively) other unstructured information. For example: say you have the string ""aBZ"" and the number 123 as a encryption key, you can apply the previous example but using a changing offset as determined by the character's position in the string, a offset by 1, b by 2 etc. Now let's say you have a string that's 33+ (size relevant to the example key, such that mod key.length is required (33 mod 32 = 1, therefor in this example string character 33 would be offset by the first digit of the key)), you may decide to concatenate two bank card numbers (32 digits) and apply them to the string in question resulting in a communicable string that would be very difficult to decipher without knowledge of the 32 digit key.

In summary; if I learnt nothing else from this experience I discovered that the skills that others have lead me to believe are confounding may also be only the beginning of their potential.

A little bit about me- I'm a  18 year old high school senior, diagnosed with Asperger's at 10. Heading off to college next year- hopefully Macalester

Look, in light of the recent tragedy in Connecticut, there has been talk. Scary SCARY talk. The media and kids at my school blaming the shooter's (I refuse to call him by name) Asperger's Syndrome as a reason for the shooting. Asperger's is high functioning autism, which gives people weird social quirks. 

It does NOT make someone attack a school.

It does NOT make someone mentally imbalanced.   

And it certainly does NOT explain this man's actions on Friday.

Today, i have heard my classmates, my friends, as well as the mainstream media say that Asperger's is to blame. I heard someone say those with Autism/Aspeger's shouldn't be allowed to by Guns. I live in a rather liberal town by the way, so it scares the heck out of me knowing that people actually think this.

So I beg you, Those of reddit who live with/live with someone with Asperger's please- talk to your community. Make sure that our community isn't the scapegoat from this horrible tragedy. Explain that this makes us a little quircky- not sociopathic.

Some back story: I'm 26, the last year or so 4 people, on different occasions have asked me if I have aspergers. Then a good friend got diagnosed and we are very similar. I did a lot of research, in the beginning just to understand his situation, but gradually I started seeing myself more and more in what I read.
I finally decided I should talk to my doctor and hear what she had to say.

The first thing I said when I walked into her office was ""I really don't want to be here right now"". Then it just poured from me. All my thoughts, all the things I have read, how everything seemed to fall into place, how I wasn't sure if I was making it all fit in my head or it was true. Everything.

After my crazy ramblings subsided she told me, ""I think you could be on to something, we should get you to a psychiatrist and have him check you out"".

I was so relieved, I wasn't going mad, she at least saw the same things I did. I don't see a diagnosis as my way of fixing everything, I don't particularly want to have a disorder of any kind. But just the fact that she could make sense of my stream of consciousness speech and recognize some of the same things I did made me feel understood for the first time in many years.

In 1999, I was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome around the age of 11 or 12. In 2001, I learned that there are jobs just for the creation of computer software. In 2003, I started learning HTML on my own. In 2005, I enrolled in a Visual Basic class at my high school. In May 2006, I graduated from high school. In May 2008, I received an Associate's degree in programming. In December 2010, I received a Bachelor's degree cum laude in information systems.

**Work/Ethics/Etc:**
Now two years later, I still don't have a job. I've applied to numerous employers here and there (more when I wasn't depressed). In fact, I've only worked about three and a half months in my entire life and in many ways, it was the best time of my life. There are many reasons why I can't get a job like the ""cycle"" of not having enough education/experience to get a job or just being socially unaware of what is acceptable at a job. But I can say that I've never even been a penny in debt and I don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs, don't commit crimes, don't have unprotected risky sex, don't collect SSI even though I probably could (and somebody tried to make me, though I got away from them and cancelled my application), don't play video games, and don't watch more than 10 hours of TV per week.  I do watch a little TV, though, because I think I deserve to have something to do in life so I don't go completely insane. But for three and a half years out of my 4 years in high school, I showed up an hour earlier than almost every student. For about 3 to 3 and a half years out of my 4 and a half years at college, I showed up earlier and studied and stayed later than almost every other commuting student. I wasn't in any extracurricular activities because I was usually too busy doing my homework and figuring out ways to deal with problems that people in general were giving me. I don't drive either because I'm afraid of having an accident and I've already had numerous close calls.

**What I've been doing (in general):**
I've been searching for work on and off depending on my how depressed I am. I've been working on ways to try to end my depression for the most part. I've been losing weight. I've been trying to learn how to make new friends. But I'm also trying to figure exactly what I want out of life because I can't get the job that I want and the passion to work to develop software is dying in me and may very well be dead, but somehow I know that it's still what I want to do. There really aren't many jobs that I qualify for these days. Many things I've also forgotten. It's nearly impossible to learn by myself. It has very little to do with dedication or motivation. It has everything to do with my learning style: that I need someone else to teach me. I can't afford anyone to teach me though because I have no money. And I don't want to be taught by just anyone. I want to be taught by somebody experienced who can reassure me that they know that they can successfully teach anybody and that after they're done with me, there's little doubt that I WILL get a job developing software.

**What I've been doing (within the last month):**
Well, I've applied to McD's (never heard anything). I've recently applied to Walmart (still waiting, will follow up tomorrow). And it looks like the next place may very well be Target. In the past, regarding minimum wage jobs, I've also applied to Staples, Best Buy, Kroger, JCPenney, Kohl's, and Menard's without any luck. And I lost a reference because she was also a friend and I wasn't listening to her problems one day because I was going through my own major crisis that whole week. And my other two references are professors who don't remember me.

**My Asperger's background:**
I'm 25 so I was too old by like a year or two for insurance to consider covering me for any kind of big treatment related to autism when I was still under 22. In fact, a worker at the Department of Mental Health told me during a 5-10 minute phone conversation that I may never qualify for any services because I'm not severely disabled enough regarding Asperger's. In that case, I truly doubt that any adult with Asperger's could ever be considered ""severely disabled enough.""

How to make it less so?,24,10,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/120xyu/dating_is_a_complete_mystery_to_me_how_to_make_it/,"So before I get into it, a little background.  I'm a 30 year old male, no official AS diagnosis but I have diagnosed depression and social anxiety and the last therapist I went to for those things told me he suspected AS and strongly suggested I go in for evaluation.  I haven't done that yet but I plan to.  Him and I have stopped seeing each other for unrelated reasons - he's relocated out of town.  My new therapist specializes in social anxiety and I'm planning on bringing this up to her as well.  My dating history is pretty lacking - I've had a fair amount of first dates but not much beyond that.  Not a virgin but pretty close, I've had 1-2 ""relationships"" that were clusterbombs of drama and lasted for all of a couple weeks each.

While I haven't been diagnosed yet, I feel like it explains a whole lot about who I am, and even if I don't meet the full diagnostic criteria I believe I definitely have a fair amount of AS traits.  I've never been outwardly expressive, I have all kinds of trouble reading people's social cues or body language, my own body language is all over the place and very rarely represents what I'm actually feeling, I will occasionally blurt out things that are on my mind but aren't appropriate for a conversation without thinking about it, the whole fun package.

But most of all, the whole concept of romantic love is just completely foreign to me.  I've never felt it for anyone, I don't desire it, and I don't really even understand it.  Before my therapist suggested I had AS I had actually identified as aromantic for a while.  A lot of my Facebook friends are getting engaged and married right now, and everyone's excited and gushing and omg so happy!!, and I... feel nothing, except maybe confusion at how someone could get so attached to another person that they would want to make that much of a commitment to them.

Which would be fine, except I also crave sex like you wouldn't believe.  (Just check my comment history for my OkCupid profile's personality bars if you don't believe me.  They're great.)  For me, a ""relationship"" would be a situation where a woman and I are mostly friends and go out and hang out like friends would but then come home together at the end of the night and screw each other's brains out.  There wouldn't be any more to it than that, honestly.  The few times I've seen a woman semi-consistently they have invariably fallen in love with me, I've stuck with it hoping that ""well, maybe it will be different this time and I will feel something,"" I don't, and they eventually can't take the emotional neglect anymore and leave.  I realize this is partially my fault, which is why I don't date much anymore and when I do I'm petrified to flirt or make any kind of moves for fear that the woman will get attached.

I don't really know what to do.  The bar scene will absolutely not work for me because the mere thought of going to a bar or a club gives me sensory overload to the point where I want to run away crying.  Online dating doesn't really work either, because most people on the online dating sites I've seen are looking for something with an emotional component.  Which leaves the ""meat market"" sites and escorts, but those don't really appeal to me either because everyone on those places just seem so... fake.  If it was just about the physical release, I can do that at home myself.  There's just something about the mutual pleasure you experience with another, real person that those sorts of things just can't replace.  You know?

Well anyway, I realize how cold and horrible all this sounds to someone who doesn't think the way I do, which is why I don't talk about this often outside of anonymous Internet outlets.  All of this makes sense and seems perfectly reasonable in my brain though.  I guess I don't even really want advice so much as I just want to know if I'm alone in feeling this way.  If there are other people who think or have thought like this and have found success in dating, how do/did you do it?",,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,,True,t3_120xyu,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/120xyu/dating_is_a_complete_mystery_to_me_how_to_make_it/,

",18,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/11u7lz/diagnosed_as_an_aspie_officially_but_i_have_other/,"Okay, it's official - I have Aspergers Syndrome.  But even for someone with Aspergers, I'm weird.

* I had a very traumatic childhood because of undiagnosed AS, and as such, I have a lot of trouble with trusting people and making friends.  This is compounded by:
* For someone with Aspergers, I have an atypically high level of compassion.  I lack empathy, as you would expect, but have a very high level of *sympathy.*  So I always *wanted* friends as a kid, but I kept getting rejected by them and I just didn't know why.  
* The result is that I've been disappointed so much in friendships and relationships that I've given up hope altogether.  It was explained to me like this by the doctor:  
""Often we find in physically abusive childhood relationships, the child will go out and purposefully get into trouble in order to get the beating that they expect over with.  You're like that, but with emotions and relationships.  It's a defense mechanism, not having hope is less painful.  But the problem is that you need hope to be mentally healthy.""  
* Many of the Asperger's ""strengths"" don't work out in my favor.  Because I am very highly intelligent (I have an IQ of 140, according to the test) nobody ever picked up on the fact that I have a learning disability in mathmatics.  The weird thing is that the high IQ and the learning disability cancel each other out, so I'm *merely average* in math.  But this has ruled out the ""build robots, become an engineer"" type of aspie.  Which sucks because things like particle physics, robotics, engineering - they're very interesting.  But I'll never be good at them because I can't hack the math.  According to the doctor, my logical mind would probably make me very good at practicing law (but there's no market for lawyers right now) or with becoming a stockbroker (which is something I never considered and don't even know how to break into - and it doesn't really interest me all that much.) I work in marketing communications, and I suppose that's okay.  
* In addition to my Aspergers, I'm also very immature for my age.  I'm 33 years old, and I have the relative maturity of maybe a 17 year old. 
* What I need are ""reparative"" relationships. Good experiences.  Especially with women. But it's hard enough for a NT guy to meet women... I'd have to find someone willing to put up with me, who doesn't mind that I'm not that physically attractive, and who's smart enough to keep up with me.  Good. Fucking. Luck.  
* I was expecting to find out I had aspergers.  I *wasn't* expecting to find out that I had mental deficiencies in mathematics or that my depression isn't based on neurochemistry but rather on learned behaviors and a lifetime of emotional abuse by my peers.  So my depression and social anxiety may one day be cured and I can be medication-free.  IF I can succeed at social relationships, which are the hardest things for an aspie to do. 

So basically, I'm a man-child, math-deficient, and an aspie.  I have depression related to trauma which I thought couldn't be cured - but I know know can be cured, but only by succeeding at the things that I have no ability whatsoever to do. 

At first I was elated because I finally figured out that what was wrong with me had a *name.*  But I'm looking at how much I'd have to accomplish, and how likely I am to fail, and how much hurt it's going to cause between then and now, and I'm thinking that maybe I should just give up.  

It's a sobering thought - my most likely outcome is dying alone and unloved.  Which is also my greatest fear.

Honestly, I felt like I was going to die. I had 20-odd people looking at me waiting for me to talk, so I just kind of word-vomited a bit about myself and that I write fairytales and then clammed up. 

A couple of people asked questions about me and what I do for a job and I said I didn't work, then of course it was ""oh are you at school"" ""are you a student"" and I just blurted out ""I don't do anything, I was too afraid to leave my house until I found out recently I have aspergers, and now that I know I'm not crazy I'm just trying to get my life back.

The woman next to me leans over maybe fifteen minutes later when everyone is busy and tells me that her 5 year old son was just diagnosed with aspergers, I feel like I'm going to die because I called myself a retard for having it, and she just thanks me for sharing and asks me if it was right of her to get him diagnosed so young, and wanted to know if my life would have been easier if I'd been diagnosed 18 years ago. Which was a resounding yes, yes it would have been. I think I could have done a lot with the energy I invested in beating myself up and trying to be 'normal', rather than just enjoying who I am. 

So I told her that I thought she was awesome for seeking a diagnosis for her son and that I hope he has an easier time than I did, but that not knowing was the source of most of my grief and problems.  We get called back in for tea and biscuits and I replay what I said over and over in my head because I'm usually very careful with words and how they affect people but in this particular instance I let myself get overwhelmed and thought I could create levity (or maybe seem like I knew I was being weird and had come to terms with it rather than being oblivious) by insulting myself, without thinking there could be other people affected.

That is how it always continued too, on average I lay in bed for about an hour to and hour and a half.  30 minutes is really really quick for me to fall asleep.

Once I am asleep I don't think I stay asleep.  I assume, from the lack of rest I feel in the morning (and continuing all day, everyday) that I constantly wake up during the night, but not enough to become conscious of it.  That has its own name, too, I just forget it.  I have vivid memories of the 3 mornings I have woken up and felt well rested (3/3 I was sick, 2/3 I had had Nyquil).  Every day I wake up groggy, like most people,  but then stay that way for the next 8 hours or so.  I yawn all day and am almost always half falling asleep.

I guess I've always had meltdowns and always been sick of them but now I want to actually try to deal with them instead of letting them run its course and maybe try to lessen the affect it has on me. So far I've only noticed that it's the little things that trigger my meltdowns, like leaving cabinet doors / drawers open, not turning off lights / TV when not using them or at night when going to bed, not answer / asking questions directly without making gestures like you expect people to know the answer / question and jokes / comments regarding previous things or decision I've made. The main trigger is when I feel like I'm not being listened to or understood. And there are a few other small things. No one thing will send me over the edge unless I've been having a bad day already, but a combination of them will.

When I meltdown I don't really say much, I get really frustrated, slamming doors and drawers and feel like hitting and breaking things. I shut down and hide away as best I can.

I don't know how else to deal with them except to wait them out with sleep, I have no one to talk or vent to, I feel like I cant talk to my family which are the offenders pretty much most of the time.

Graphic novels, on the other hand, I enjoy on a more greater scale. I enjoy the different facial expressions and body motions of the characters. It's always fun to look at the background settings and look at all of the little details the artists put into them.

Of all of the different forms of graphic novels out there, I read manga the most. I love the art style and overuse of screentones.

I'm not a loud breather myself (except for when having caught a bad cold) but it even freaks me out when I can hear myself breathe when using earplugs or earphones. For a while I had to take off my earphones every time one song ended until the next one started because I couldn't stand the noise. That or I had to hold my breath. It's a little bit better now.

Because I hate that noise so much I, for some reason, think everyone else hates it too. Because of that and because of the fact that I can't even stand to hear myself breathe I can't even listen to music in my earphones when walking outside (which sucks because I'd like to be able to listen to music to block out other noises).

When sitting next to someone on the bus I worry that my breathing is too loud, which it really isn't (I only think it is because I'm wearing earphones and can hear it really well). In those situations I often have to use logic and tell myself that there's no way I breathe louder than the noises the bus makes and all the other noises on the bus.

* I have defaulted student loans, and other debts just keep piling up.
* I lose jobs frequently.
* Despite being in one of the most lucrative careers in today's economy (programmer) I frequently am completely broke due to downtime with no contracts and no job, where I am slowly, painfully switching modes to get my ""marketing"" pipeline going (sometimes this is a job search).  
* I have so many different self-improvement routines in place that they all interfere with each other.  
* There are so many books I've started reading and never finished it's ridiculous.  Don't get me wrong - I think you can usually drop a book at about 80% and be fine but I also have lots of books at about 5%.
* I'm frequently late for meetings.  
* I have many different non-overlapping ""life goals"" such as ""go to space"" and ""run a restaurant"" and ""become a therapist"".  
* My buddy asked me ""whats the most important thing in your life?"" and I said something like ""right now I'm focusing on keeping you entertained"".

It's only been very recently - within the past month about - that I have been holding the hypothesis that I'm an Aspie.  But it fits like a glove so I'm pretty certain.  

How much of this do you guys experience?  Let's use this thread to share techniques.  For me even though I've got problems they're smaller than they used to be.  Here are some things that have helped me (start to) get my sh*t together:  

* meditation: sit quietly in comfy position, look at floor, think nothing, for 5 minutes (use a timer)  
* 5-minute cleaning: again the 5-minute timer, clean until alarm goes off, stop.  This trains cleaning as a habit, instead of a project.  
* step-by-step planning:  break down objective into intermediate steps.  Keep dividing steps until each is so simple there's no way I could fail or get distracted.  For example, ""put all papers on desk into a single, unordered stack.  Envelopes in a separate stack"".  Then ""open each envelope and staple the contents into a single bundle.  discard envelopes.""  Then ""using a red sharpie, label the top page of each bundle with a brief description of its contents"".  

Amount of time I've been doing these habits:  

* meditation: 10 years (incredibly helpful for reducing anxiety and increasing flexibility of thinking and improving mood)
* 5-minute cleaning: I've been doing this for about 2 years.
* super-detailed sequence planning: only about 4 months  
* edit: forgot to mention time spent with a therapist

Still, I know I have some autistic characteristics like hypersensibility, social anxiety, obsessions, etc. 

Lately, I came to a class wearing ear plugs to diminish the sound around me. Someone asked me why I had those on and I said I was hypersensible to which the person replyed that everyone was a bit hypersensible (I guess that she was meaning that many people in the music program where a bit hypersensible, probably including herself). I don't like this kind of attitude at all. She doesn't have to wear earplugs so she's not stressed by surrounding sounds does she? Never have she done panic attacks because of it? It's dedramatizing an issue which I live with and thinking you have every problems.

Another was when I told someone I had a grat deal of social anxiety and she said that she had a bit too (dedramatizing...) and that it was worse when she was younger. She had never done any anxiety attacks at all. How can she compare her problems to mine? It's really bad. Even I tend to say that my problems are not as big as they are because I hate being the victim and having to enter the contest of ""who suffers the most"". 

By the way, when I talked about my problems, it was only because they asked first for why I did certain things and all and there's many more examples including some with obsessions.

This concerns a friend.

He's a diagnosed Aspie over 20.

So he told me about what he experiences on a daily basis. When doing anything, often memories from his past will come to mind. These memories are linked to what he's doing when it happens.

For example, he can drink a coffee, and something in the aroma or scent of it will trigger a memory, and this memory will come back full force in his mind, like he would remember drinking coffee with someone years before.

Or he could be planning something to do outside, and then all of a sudden a memory with a distant link to his plan would come again.

Now, I think it may happen to everybody to have some sort of a library of memories sending you unrequested events or facts from your past.

How did I do? Slightly edited to maintain privacy

Message Starts Now: 

You know that I'm socially awkward and lack social skills. You know that it’s affected my relationship history. But I wonder if you understand the scope of the effect this has had on me. If only it were as simple as me having trouble with conversations, then life would be sweet. My life experience relationship wise is so outside the norm that I doubt that others could really grasp it. In some ways the idea that others might understand actually scares me.

If nobody understands then that means I'm ""different"", I wasn't like others so it would be natural that I wouldn't be able to ""grow up"" like everyone else, and my current state would in many ways be excused.

But, if others could understand, if people really can sympathize with my past, do you know what that would mean? It would mean that I'm not so different after all. It would mean that, despite my obvious issues, I was still similar enough to understand, which means that despite how I might fight it, at the end of the day, where I am now is my fault. If, two people are close enough to understand one another, then given adequate time and effort there is no reason that one who lacks social skill shouldn't be able to build the necessary skills and catch up with the other. If, people understand then who I am today is a result of me not trying hard enough, or paying attention, or not trying to be friendly or something else.

It would mean that years of being alone could have been avoided with only a little more effort. Just that little bit of effort and I wouldn't have spent most of my life feeling like an outcast, I wouldn't have had to watch other people play with their friends and get invited to birthday parties, while wondering why nobody ever invited me. Who knows, maybe I wouldn't have cried myself to sleep at night praying that I would wake up a different person, a person who got along well with others and had a girlfriend. Perhaps, I would be going out with friends more often because I would be willing to ask, and not automatically assume that no-one wants to go anywhere with me. Maybe, I would have had at least one friend see my bedroom in the past 6 years. That is what scares me, the possibility that everything that has happened to me and led me to where I am now, is actually all my fault.

Obviously I'm not like that anymore; I've grown a lot since then. I used to tell absolutely no-one what my feelings were. And had in many ways ""resigned myself to my fate"" to the point that eventually I can honestly say I wondered if I even had feelings. After I moved to {{Place where I am now}}, about midway through freshman year, it gave me a chance to ""start over"" in a way. Now that start over wasn't flawless but it did lead to one of the most important things that ever happened to me, joining ROTC. When I joined ROTC, it provided a sense of structure to normal communication, making me feel more confident in communicating. It also provided a sense of camaraderie that allowed me to make friends, people that I enjoyed hanging out with and talking to. Now I've had friends before, I wasn't a complete loner but I had never really done anything with others outside the classroom. So this was different and finally felt real. The thing is that structure only applied to people who were apart of ROTC, for everyone else I was still behind. Anyways long story short(er) time went on, I improved and here I am now.

Pheww!! That took a while! I'm glad I wrote it though; it’s about time I learned to open up. That's why I never know what to talk about and why I message you so often, it's because, I enjoy talking to you and messaging you more than just about anything, I'm just not very good at it yet. I am improving though. That is what it means to be me right now. And congratulations you made it to the end.

But, seeing as he has AS, he is one of the worst liars known to man. The first time, I let it slide. But now he has lost all electronic stimuli except tv for 3 weekends straight. What should I do?",23,10,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/127pfs/crimes_and_punishments_i_am_a_dad_to_an_11yearold/,"The first time I caught him in a lie (and gave him several chances to back out of the lie gracefully) we just sat down and had a talk. I'd like to say it was a long talk, but without eye contact I never know what is sinking in so I try to keep things short, sweet, and to the point. 

Then it happened a few days later. This time, I took away all video games and computers (unless needed to type/research homework) but I left tv. Why? I didn't want to torture the lad. 

Well, he played outside a lot that weekend. I also found that he needed more one on one attention from my wife and I. That was an unexpected bonus as he is often reclusive on the weekends. (Note: he has a tv and a dvd player in his room but the gaming consoles are in common areas so he is forced to interact with his family while playing. I doubt we'd see him if he was allowed to take the Wii and the PS3 into his room. He also has a netbook in his room. It is more than enough to do all of his homework on, but nowhere near enough to actually game on.) 

So on Thursday of this past week, I caught him in a lie again. I straight out let him know that I knew. He looked confused and decided to push his cause. It was concerning homework... so i just told him to show me his paper that was due Friday. He actually opened his book bag and looked through it and then proclaimed that he must've lost it. ""No problem. I will just check the printer history and print another copy for you."" Can I actually do that? He'll no! But as I open up my laptop, he realized that he's busted. 

So I instituted the same punishment as the previous two weekends. My wife and I discussed taking away tv as well, but then we would either lose him to his books or we would have to be dancing monkeys for him the entire time. (Somewhere along the way in life, he got the impression that he has to be entertained at all times, whether it be angry birds on my phone while eating dinner out or taking 200-300 Zoobs with him for a 20 minute car ride. We have tried to curb that, but it is getting worse with age. I can dress myself, the 2-year-old,and pack the diaper bag in less time than it takes him to collect toys/books/games for the road. Is this a normal for someone with AS?) 

We chose not to take away tv also as a matter of convenience. We were not trying to be shitty parents but life happens. My wife and I are both getting over the flu... neither boy will get the attention they deserve this weekend. 

I don't want to keep taking his computer time and video games from him, but he is not getting the message about lying to his mother and I. I even went so far as to point out his tells so that he will know I am not just guessing. It certainly did not make him a better liar, as my wife feared. 

But now I feel like I am nit picking everything he says looking for the next lie. 

What punishment worked for you? Do I need to put it in writing? I was thinking of making a family handbook with basic rules and expectations, along with possible punishments.... but that seems like a lot of work. The next time I catch him in a lie, I think the best punishment will be to have him write the handbook instead. He could even get input on punishments. My wife says he would see this as absolute torture and that i should not do it. (She and I are still in discussions.) 

The next option on my list would be to write an essay about the importance of telling the truth and how half-truths are still lies. I would basically give him 5-6 topics and let him hand write it. Then we can revise it and he can type it up. I know once he reads something, he knows it. I think the same goes for things he writes... if not, he can always reread the essay. I gave that option to him on Thursday but he chose to go without electronics for 4 days instead of taking about 3 hours to write an essay. Logic does not seem to set in at times. 

Can any of you please share punishments that actually worked on you as a tween (God, I hate that word) or teen? If not a punishment, how do I get my old Alex back? The one who would not lie for any reason. Do you think having things in writing would help or is that just going overboard? I say if he can read it and commit it to memory, he can no longer put the blame on everyone but himself. For example, if the handbook included a rule that says he must have his teeth brushed before 9pm on a school night and before going to bed on Friday and Saturday nights, will he stop saying ""because no one told me to"" when asked why his teeth are not brushed? Same thing for his meds, his laundry, his trash, etc... Unless he is told to do these things, he won't take any responsibility. It's always someone else's fault. I know he's only 11 but he's gonna be in high school before we know it, and then college we hope. But if he lives alone in college, it will all be on him. 

I feel he needs more routine, but my wife is Mrs Spontaneous. I just want to see him grow up to be a productive member of society. And as such, he needs rules and consequences now.

I've always been in awe of just how powerful his mind seems to be, but his ability to turn on and off pain is baffling. He once cut into his arm to prove to his sister that pain can be controlled, resulting in a scar and a freaked out sister. He doesn't wear jackets in the winter (where we live it snows and gets down to the 20s [F]) because he says he just ignores the cold. In high school he sat in a wall-sit for 38 minutes, just to prove to his coach and fellow wrestling teammates that it could be done. I was just wondering if anyone else here has the same experience of controlling pain/cold/heat?

Haha on a lighter note, whenever I wanted to tickle him I always had to catch him off guard because otherwise he would just turn off his tickle-sensors before I could even get to him. What a party pooper :P
Anyway, thanks in advance for any input.

About a month ago, I went in to a neuropsychologist who I met through my primary care doctor after expressing my concern about my life, behavior, and social issues that I've been coming aware of the past few years. 

This is the first time that I had ever really spoke to a psychologist besides a couple meetings with a counselor at college when I was going through a tough time. After much research, reading this subreddit, and speaking with my family, I decided that I should take advantage of what health insurance I had and see what was causing my issues. The meeting took a full day, right around 8 hours total, and involved some 1-on-1 discussions about my current and past life, some cognitive testing and IQ-type tests, and lots of memory based activities all the while notes were taken on my reaction, personality, and behavior while conducting these tests. 

It was very exhausting mentally, but it was still exciting and interesting taking tests that I had rarely encountered and was eager to find results as well. After tests were done, I was instructed to come back the week after to go over results. We spent awhile going over the outcomes of the tests and then moved on to any diagnoses. I was told that I did not have Asperger's as per the current DSM, but I was very close to being qualified. However, I was told that I had damage in the front-right hemisphere of my brain that was causing me to be diagnosed with Non-visual Learning Disorder (NVLD/NLD). I had also some OCD traits, but not significant enough to grant a label. We talked about these for awhile and it made sense to me. It felt good to know, but it felt bad to know as well. 

Having a diagnosis doesn't change anything about me, but rather gives me a way to identify my own behavior and have a rational explanation on why it occurs instead of just being frustrated and depressed as to why I act the way I do.

Last night, my mother and I watched [this episode](http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episode/autism-enigma.html) of David Suzuki's *The Nature of Things* on autism and a new theory that autism is caused by neurotoxin producing gut-bacteria.

This is very hard for me and it makes me nervous/awkward typing this.

My dad, being racist, told a lot of racist jokes.  I lived in  Memphis at the time and lived in the South-East part of town.  For those who are familiar with the locale, I lived about a mile from the ""Mall.""  I was pretty well in the minority but regardless of residing lower-income housing, I didn't know any better.  The school I went to put me in a minority position as well.  This didn't bode well with my Aspergers.

As for my education I tried to fit in but due to my dad, I was indifferent.  I grew up learning jokes and racial undertones as OK and normal but never said anything about them outside of the home.  My character was more observant and attempting to learn in elementary school.  While I saw one side with my dad, I saw another away from him of people of different races.  This got me to thinking about my environment - that I was different.

It was then I started attempting to fit in and rather than do be myself, I started mimicking other people.  Fast-forward to sixth grade, I did something really bad; although for me, in the end, it opened my eyes:  I told a racist joke in front of a class of thirty students.  This joke stopped the class and teacher dead in their tracks and prompted the teacher to pull me aside out of the classroom.  She promptly asked me if I had realized what I had done, to which I had responded ""No.""

I had just then insulted seventy percent of the class.  I had then learned what racism was and my life had changed forever.  I had learned a new side of my father and many other people.  I was naïve about this until then and my eyes were opened because I attempted to mimic my father (repeating what he said the way he said it.)

Now I find racism everywhere and despise it.  I find the term African-American racist.  I find the term ""white"" and ""Caucasian"" racist.  I do not teach my children racism; I teach them equality.  In everything I learn my mistakes, I pass on and educate them.  I used to be so closed-minded about life but life has made me open-minded.  The more I see, the more I become open.  I have been to over thirty countries and nearly circumnavigated the globe, living in a few of them [countries] and observing ways of life.  In my travels I have found that the United States is the most racist country I have ever lived in.

I don't know what to think about people - and have become afraid of many of them because of how they look at me.  So many terms are derogatory and their politically-correct terms to change are almost as bad.  It isn't enough to be ""tolerant"" or ""diverse,"" you have to see people as people and not skin or labels, and that is what I am attempt to show my children.  We all bleed the same and me and my ASD kids understand that. By my estimations, it will take the United States approximately 240-260 years to get past racism, which is unfortunate, and I am being conservative with those numbers.  :(

**TL;DR**: My father was/is racist, and so was I - until my eyes were opened and I saw the truth. 

Edit:  For those who aren't understanding this post, I am not repeating the joke.  My point is that I made an incredibly racist joke in the sixth grade that offended a classroom full of students including a teacher.  Prior to that joke I had no clue what racism was; after that incident my eyes were opened to world of racism.",,False,,t5_2rm6u,1341623814.0,,,True,t3_w4zjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/w4zjx/fellow_aspies_what_is_the_worst_thing_you_have/,

I've never really been active on any kind of forum (is that was this is classified as?) like this before but I thought it might be interesting / useful for me to give it a go so here I am.

I have always had problems with motivation and I find that although I am able to rationally understand that what I do now matters for my future I don't actually really care about it and as a result I struggle a lot with doing anything that I do not want to do right now.

This has had quite a large negative impact on school life because I pretty much never do homework or revision and as a result tend not to get the grades I should. I actually do well in exams normally because I seem to just remember things a lot of the time but when it comes down to getting coursework done I don't do well. I am now at the end of my school life - I have 3 exams left - and am hopefully moving on to college (in the English sense - not university) next year and am worried that this is going to make things difficult.

I spend a large amount of my time programming (computing is my passion) but I find that sometimes I can't even persuade myself to do that - even in a situation where I am in the middle of a really interesting project. 

Does anyone else have these issues? And if so, any tips on dealing with them?  

**Possible software project**

I've been wondering recently about whether there could be a way I could use my ability in computing to help myself and/or others with Aspergers and I thought this might be a good place to ask for inspiration.

Is there anything in the way of a piece of software that you think might help you with problems caused by Aspergers? Would you be interested in this idea?

I'm not making any promises to do anything but if people are interested in this then I would be willing to work on it as a project and would make anything I created freely available here. While I would consider myself a capable programmer it is also worth noting that I'm not yet formally trained so I make no promises about my ability.

Right, if I don't submit this now I'll spend hours editing this and probably never actually submit it. I hope everything is clear and feel free to ask me any questions you like.

But now that he is older he is getting to be more creative and I can't tell the difference between his Aspie issues with certain foods and his being a pain in the butt 7 year old not wanting to eat the healthy stuff.  For example - he has always liked bananas.  All of a sudden he hates them.  Is this a legit thing or is he being a pain?  

And he is stubborn as hell.  He had 4 bites of bananas to eat with his lunch.  (a peanut butter sandwich - which he lives on btw).  He knew if he didn't eat them, he was going to his room for a while.  Well, he just sat there and sat there and sat there, and is now chilling out in his room.  Refused to even look at them.  He wont try ANYTHING new, and will break down completely if I push him too hard to try something else, as well as just go hungry.  Since I am not in the habit of starving my kid, I usually just make him a sandwich and give him some fruit snacks and leave it at that.

All he eats basically is:  Peanut butter sandwiches (NO JELLY).  Cereal (from cheerios to fruit loops he likes a lot of them, with the sugar ones being his fav of course).  Chicken nuggets and fries.  Hot dogs.  Occasionally he will eat mac &amp; cheese.  Bread (plain).  Toast.  Fruit snacks.  He loves all the normal snacky stuff like cookies and chips, but we limit that stuff around here.  Graham crackers, goldfish, pretzels. Grilled cheese (with american cheese).  He used to like bananas and dried pineapples and raisins but now he wont go near any of it.  He wont touch fruit juice except at school, in his lunch he gets a caprisun.  He lives on milk or chocolate milk or water. 

 His bread and cereals and whatnot are fortified with vitamins and minerals and his doc says not to worry about it...But I do worry about it.  He's miserable when we go out to eat somewhere, or over to people's houses.  I dont know how to expand his horizons.  I tried using examples like Green Eggs and Ham, and other stories or real life examples, but he just says NOPE. and thats it.

I realized a couple of years ago that I visualize all spoken words: my own, those of the people talking to me, movies, songs, etc. I found this out in an interesting way: I was assigned to make the edits in a written version of my wife's speech, which she was dictating to me. The fact that she was reciting different words than the ones I was seeing and I had to write the new ones created a visual nightmare that I could not begin to describe - it felt like looking into a bag of Scrabble tiles.

Conversely, if something has a unique spelling - a name, for instance, not a common word - that does not match its pronunciation, I have to force myself to ""blank out"" the word, otherwise I will sound it out. This ""blanking out"" is how I read, btw - without having a mental sound of the words in my mind. It enables me to read very fast, which I believe is what those speedreading classes train you to do.

I know no other way to say it. I'm overwhelmed, and I may have tons of words running through my head when you ask me a question, but I can't get any of them to come out. It's very distressing in and of itself, in addition to whatever brought it on in the first place. I usually end up crying and shaking and going through a mental loop of all the things I could possibly say but that don't seem quite accurate enough, and all the things I think I should just force myself to say, just to say something, but can't get them to actually come out, and the more I think about it - and worse, the more I'm questioned - the more distressed and paralyzed and nearly hysterical I get. 

I used to think, in my teens, this was just depression. Because I WAS very depressed then, and very overwhelmed, and I frequently found myself in this state. It led to my quitting high school, college, and 5 or so jobs. Even the one job I finally held down (for 2.5 yrs) almost put me over the edge once when I was just stood there bawling, unable to make myself go to work. My boyfriend argued with me and tried to make me go, but eventually ended up calling in sick for me. 

But I know the difference now between depression and this other, more severe yet more short lived state I get into. I think maybe it's related to depression. Or anxiety. Or asperger's. Or all three. 

I feel extremely tense. I usually cry very hard (I'm a cryer anyway - tears usually come with all my strong emotions). I have many thoughts but can barely manage to voice even the very simplest answers to questions. When someone is trying to help or comfort me I know it's impossible for them to know what I'm thinking or what I might need and yet I can't do anything about it. And worse, I don't know how to help myself out of the state. Worse, sometimes when I do manage to answe I can only seem to yell or speak through gritted teeth, so whoever is trying to be there for me thinks I'm angry at them. Usually that would be my husband. 

And the very worst is when something else is going on at the same time, such as tonight when my husband needed me for his problems, but in becoming overwhelmed by the situation I started having my own problems and can't get out of this mental state, which as far as I know I'm the only one to experience. 

Some things have helped in the past....a long walk. Vegging out in front of the tv followed by sleep... Sometimes they help. Sometimes not. That's all I know. I beg forgiveness for my grammatical errors.

We are all biologically different.  There are extremes, but this appears to me that someone has decided we need to be ""fixed"" because others can't view the world with as much depth.

The whole problem I have is the premise... it isn't to get a greater understanding, but rather to fix something that we don't even know is a problem at all.

I've always had trouble making friends and with doing well in school. The only thing I've had to hold on to was the fact that I'm musically talented. I play a few instruments and have accomplished a lot with them in the past 8 years. But still, people in high school would give me crap and talk bad about me because I did so well in music and I made it look so easy. And I just finished my first year of college and it wasn't easy. I spent the majority of my first semester in depression and I didn't make real friends until the end of the spring semester.

I was enrolled in summer classes and only was able to go to one day of class in good health because the next day, I woke up with double vision and the day after that, I went to the doctor and that night, I was admitted into the hospital.

BEWARE this is going to be long.

I'm 22. 

I should say before you read anything, I am not suicidal and never will be. I cannot be that selfish and I love my life. 

I have no true friends, absolutely no one with the same interests as mine. I live in a little country town and no way of going out. Literally every single person in this town is an asshole redneck cowboy. At this point I can't even mention xbox without being laughed at. 

I feel that my life has been falling apart. I've always, always tried to forgive and forget, to be the nicest person I could. I never judge and always give someone a chance. So why does life treat me like such shit.

I've been an outcast all of my life. I've been looked down on, hated for no reason, ignored. No one ever listens to what I want. No one has ever truly wanted to hang out with me. I'm always met with a straight NO. ALL of my life. I feel like I don't belong in this race. I'm an alien soul that got stuck in a human body on this human planet. 

I feel that karma has something against me. I've always gotten the short end of the stick, the shitty end of the bargain. I find a girl, we have a great time. I lose my virginity and she dumps me a day after. My heart is broken. I fail in relationship after relationship, none last a week. 

I had my first somewhat long-term relationship 3 months ago. Then she ended it. It started with ""I can see being with you for a long time."" to ""I hate being around you, and I believe you are the most stupid person I've met."" She had 3 great children, they were the most fun to be around and I was the greatest man in their lives. She turned them against me. They hate me now. It breaks my heart more and more every day. 

I have recently finally found a beautiful woman that is actually interested in the same things as I am. That is amazing to be around and is falling for me. 

Something popped up... Herpes. Now there's no chance for me and this amazing woman. She doesn't want to catch anything permanent she's too young. 

I asked the other woman WTF and she denied, every little bit. I hate her now. I've been hearing rumors around town. She might be pregnant. WHAT DO I DO? I've decided to take the child if the rumor is true. The mother is an abusive drunk. A total bitch. I'm not ready for a child, she's too immature for a child. I want to cry, but I've always been the level-headed one, the tough one. I have no one to talk to about it. I have no true friend that can help me. 

My living situation has gone to hell. I have a job making a measly 300 every two weeks. I'm living with my mom, she has no income and cannot work at all. Can barely walk. My little brother lives with us. She had a boyfriend that has been helping pay the bills. 2 months ago he left her to go to the city. Leaving me with all of the bills. I can't keep up. I work my ass off, I don't see a cent. This has been effecting me so much that I've turned into an asshole at home. It's so incredibly hard to control. I constantly bitch, but when I notice I apologize. I try so hard to not be mean. My brother's grades are failing. He's bullied at school. He's following the same path I have in my life. It breaks my heart so much that i've turned into a hardass to try to help. WHAT DO I DO?

I try to love my life, I try to love this world. But it's getting so much harder every day. I keep on trucking hoping I will finally hit a happy place in my life. It's so hard. 

That felt really good to get off my chest. A little bit of the depression has reduced. 

Thank you for reading if you did, that was quite a novel and only half of the shitty things that have happened to me in my life.

* What are your tastes in music?

* Why do you listen to music?

* What's the most important part of music?


I'll start:

* I am pretty open-minded. I like mainly heavy metal, classical, film/video game music, some jazz, the occasional dubstep song, some opera, etc. Epica is currently my obsession. The lead singer is also sexy as hell.

* I listen to music for many reasons. It is one of the main influences of my mood, but my mood is also one of the main reasons I listen to it. I tend to like fast-paced, action-packed, panic-inducing walls of epic. The reason is because I have a slight bit of chronic anxiety and while some may argue that type of music is fuel for it, in a very odd way, it kind of gives my anxiety something to concentrate on.

* For me, everything is treated as a melodic instrument. Lyrics tend to play a back seat, but they are nowhere near unimportant. However, if the lyrics are really sad, but the mood of the song does not reflect that, then the song has no meaning for me. I like to hear every nook and cranny of a song, and pay attention to the finer details. Thus, I tend to listen to music as loud as whatever speaker system lets me.

The first is that I don't know how to show sexual attraction towards someone and that makes it ambiguous if I am attracted or not. Except when I had the phase to think that it was seducing to look someone right in the eyes for a long time, then one could know I was attracted but it still looked odd I was told. 

The second is that my lack of confidence make's me look really unsure and all. I don't really know what it means but it's a theory someone suggested me that I could look a bit too unsure of what to do so it makes me look asexual.

The third one would be that I respect women ""too much"" (never can we respect someone too much but still) and that makes me look like I have no sexual drive. This would be coupled with the fact that I rarely talk about sex but when I do, people say it's weird because I ""look asexual"". Would this be a loop?

Anyway, I just wanted to know if it happens to some of you. Also I wanted to know why you think it could happen. ",,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,,True,t3_1dtpgw,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1dtpgw/looking_asexual/,

Everything was fine when I first walked in. I was with my mother and sister, we ordered our food and sat down. Usually I'm ok with restaurants. Things are a little loud, but it's nothing I can't handle. But today it seemed like, gradually, I could hear just about everything. I could hear every scraping of forks on plates, every spoon clanking against bowls, the clickety-clack of laptop keys, conversations halfway across the room (though I could not discern what was being said, I could still hear them). My mother speaking to me about grocery lists only made it worse. She shoved a paper and pen my way, and I, without even thinking about it, shoved it back. She got pissed off at me because she felt I was giving her attitude. Her raised voice didn't help anything. When she asked me what my problem was, I didn't speak to her. I knew from previous experience that I couldn't. Every time I'd said something to her while I was agitated like this, she'd taken it the wrong way. Eventually I got to the point where I just had to go hide away for a while in the bathroom. I walked in, locked myself in a stall, pulled my shirt up to cover my head, pulled my arms in and just held myself. After that, I stepped out of the stall. Just as I thought I had calmed myself down, a lady walks into the bathroom. I'm a man. It had never occurred to me that I was in the woman's bathroom. I was so distracted/ overloaded that I mistook the signs and didn't notice that a urinal was missing. This only upset me more, so I went to the proper bathroom this time and just let it out. I was finally able to calm down, and it wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been, but it wasn't a fun experience at all. I don't know if anyone else here has experienced anything like this.

It seems like I see the world differently and that I think in a different way. At least that's the impression I've gotten over the course of my life. I feel like I'm much more rigid, obsessive, that I have higher and stricter moral standards/values etc. I want truth, knowledge and perfection. I want routines, plans and structure. I prioritise interests over people. I'm quiet and speak only when I have something to say (if I can find a good way to communicate it).

I also feel like I notice things and that people don't really bother to observe their surroundings. The psychologist who decided I'm definitely going to get assessed for ASD said I'm undoubtedly very observant. I love observing things and noticing details. I often look for details. One of my favourite things to do is to sit on the bus (if no one's sitting next to me that is) with one song on repeat (over and over and over again) in my ears, so that I'm ""in my own world"", and just look at things. I don't know if that's some sort of ""mental stim"" or something but I really like it and I could probably do so for hours and hours (though I don't). I often look at things in social situations as well. I look at things around me all the time which I think makes people think I'm either bored or not listening (which is correct sometimes but not always). 

Sometimes I also feel like I take the time to appreciate nature more than most people. When I walk outside I often think of what I'm breathing (the elements), how my lungs work, how my heart works, why the sky is blue, why my eyes see the sky as blue, why I see colours, if we all perceive colours the same way, that it's taken light 8 minutes to get here from the sun etc. I think about these things frequently and when I tell people about it they think I'm weird. Most people seem to think only of ""shallow"" things. I'm not saying all people are like that but that's the impression I've gotten from most people. I don't think like they do. Sometimes I might but most of the time I don't. Perhaps that's not the case but someone's yet to prove me wrong.

I absolutely love how intelligent and modest he is. From what I can tell, his life is incredibly difficult. I have learned that he takes care of his siblings, works full time, and is in school full time for multiple degrees. I assume he is only 20 years old. For the record, he has never told me that he has AS but it seems pretty obvious to me that he does. For the past 8 years now, I have been living with my step dad who was diagnosed with AS a few years back. I know how to spot the signs and how to deal with day to day situations with him quite well by now. This boy I like seems extremely shy, pauses when he talks, uses beautiful vocab, is small in stature, is loud when talking, and is painfully smart in school.  About a week ago, I ran into him in the hallway and asked him to tutor me. In my panic and anxiety at actually talking to him, I completely forgot to set a time and more or less walked away from him. The next day, he showed up early in lab with nicer than usual attire on. I could easily see that he was very nervous. I was already with a bunch of other girls which I am sure made his appearance that much more difficult. He then formally greeted himself to me and answered a few questions before we all went up to class. The next day, he disappeared from school for a week. When he returned, he informed me that his absence was due to some important family problems he had take care of. He then gave me his phone number and obliged to help me study. After giving me his number he said he overheard me talking about a study group that Sunday. I proceeded to invite him and he seemed excited to go. A few days later when Sunday rolled around, I texted him and there was no response. Eventually he said he wasn't going to make and and thanked me for inviting him anyways. That Monday we had an exam. I texted him, asking how he did and he never responded. The next day in class he ended up having to sit next to me. We were lab partners and after class I asked him to join me in studying after class. He seemed hesitant and then agreed. After about 30 min. of extremely stimulating conversation with him, including some family problems of his and where we were planning on going academically, he packed his things and said ""see ya around"". It almost felt like he had to force the words out. Was he trying to act normal? Basically, I want to know if there is a chance he will make a move if he is interested, or is this all up to me? I can't quite put into words how he makes me feel. But I honestly cannot read into his emotions in the slightest bit. Does this seem like Aspergers to you guys?

Not good or bad, just weird, because I knew I was different but didn't know why.

In elementary school I was a spelling genius, and I aced every test from any subject anyone threw at me, but I always failed group work because I sucked at figuring out exactly what we were all supposed to do, and I had late work piled up so thick it was like a textbook. In first grade I never spoke to anyone (not an exaggeration), and I only had about 2 or 3 friends at any given time.

In middle school I was the weird kid who sat in the corner in gym class and infodumped about pokemon with the other weird kid. I couldn't throw, kick, or catch a ball to save my life and constantly was bullied for it. Silly noises and funny accents made me laugh so hard I could barely breathe, and I would be the only one in the class reacting that way while everyone just sat and stared. I also had this habit of chewing on pens/erasers, so much to the point where they broke every few weeks.

In high school I started to get more social, and I graduated from being the weird kid to being the nice weird kid. I attended a few parties (just one or two) and got immediately shunned for being the guy who seriously offended some girl without even knowing I did, and for having a meltdown on a diving board due to never having used one.

Life with my parents was also difficult. They didn't understand me at all. They thought my weirdness was because I was being mean or manipulative which was definitely not the case. Though they loved me very much (and I them), because my personality is so different from theirs, and my reactions to things are never what they're expecting due to them not knowing I wasn't an NT, they would often set me off on meltdowns, so much that it was hurting our relationship.

In college I finally started to get assimilated into the social world, mostly because I would hang out with other people who were at least slightly introverted and enjoyed being together in small groups and doing low-stress things (like movie nights, game night, etc.). That doesn't mean I coasted through like a boss, however. Some of my narrow obsessions got too intense for a friend of mine and she yelled at me, saying it was annoying and a little creepy, so I kinda went off on her. Though she didn't want to talk to me, I was very remorseful and kept trying to fix things with her, often messaging her and her relatives every day on multiple social networking sites because I thought she had blocked me. All I wanted to do was hear her accept my apology, nothing more. She finally threatened legal action against me so I stopped. I still don't think what I did was wrong, however, because (at least to me) it's what any sane person would have done had they lost a friend.

Because of all this, finally finding out what I am gives me peace, because it explains a lot about why my personality was the way it was, and I can finally reconcile all the ""Oh God...why?"" moments in my life.

Hi, my name's Seth and I'm an alcoho..... ooops, wrong support group.  I'm not even a lush, what am I saying?  ON WITH IT!!!....

I'm classified as aspie (right support group this time, yeeeaaaah). I like to run social experiments with people, putting on different personalities &amp; combinations of accents, inflections &amp; mannerisms in different situations, monitoring reactions, sometimes I change my looks, playing with social &amp; verbal context, subtext and pretext, maybe finding where people's limits are and/or challenging them to think, throwing in the occasional hilarious mind-fuck for good measure as well as shits and giggles.  If I could sum up the essence of these experiences, I'd characterize it as being like a scientist on an observational mission to document species interactions and routines, figuring out what makes them tick.  As the scientist one must wear costumes to fit in and observe. 

One of my favorite social costumes is the one I change my looks for; I have long curly hair, a high voice register and when clean-shaven, I totally rock the androgynous look, even get hit on by butch lesbians who mistake me for one of their own, until they see the adam's apple that is (I'm a gay male btw). There is nothing more interesting to me than seeing people's eyes twitch and get vaguely unfocused, you can almost hear their hard-drive cycle into the [click of death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWR34wKBNS0) when presented with a being they don't know how to categorize, how it bucks the monkey-brain sense of familiarity and incites paranoia or curiousity depending upon one's mindset. It's also interesting to observe the wide variance in reaction to the pitch of one's voice.  If I lower to baritone, people are nicer to me and seem to want to engage more, if I go back to base soprano setting there is a much higher incidence of deferential and/or avoidant behavior and signs of nervous tenseness though most of that disappears if I have a beard.  People are strange creatures.

I also like to play around with alpha-male-type hierarchy personality types and see how people react to someone who is politely assertive and outspoken versus someone who is very softspoken and deferential.  Sometimes I like to use diametrically opposite personality types serially on folks I'm never likely to meet again just to see how they react.  Some of them tweak right out and get nervous (in which case I back off) and some of them adapt quite impressively with the flow.  I generally end up liking these types.

Some have told me that this is attention-seeking behavior on my part, I don't feel this to be so because I'm really not doing this to wank my ego, which I'm generally very detached from.  I'm doing it because I find it interesting.

  I feel fortunate that having these talents has enabled me to adapt really well socially (except when I'm feeling drained and want to be alone to recharge).  I'll also add in that I sometimes use these tools to manipulate people but usually in a good way to lead them to answers and resources which they are in need of because some things seriously can't be expressed in language, they have to be expressed in experience and first-person observation. If they are someone who is a particularly mean/nasty bullying type, I manipulate them into using their own worst traits against themselves and frying their social reputations so that they have to change for the better in order to regain social capital. Some folks have told me that I have a way of getting under their skin in a good way, which has to be one of the most unique compliments I've ever received.

The parts of the lessons where we're on empty roads have been great; the basic car-handling stuff (gear changes, clutch control, smooth braking, keeping it straight on the road, etc etc) stuff goes fine on those roads. If another car is coming towards me I could handle it fairly smoothly. My instructor was fairly happy with my abilities, so he got me to drive all the way back home.

As soon as I was on busier roads where I had to pay attention to lots more cars, all that second-nature stuff flew out the window, and I really struggled to multitask. Instructor kept having to intervene to stop me from doing stupid things like swerving wildly and twice I made the car emit that lovely ""burning clutch"" smell, eek.

Now instructor says it's fairly natural early on to get muddled up like that, but what stood out was how I was doing everything sequentially instead of multitasking. Like, I can't be steering round a corner and remembering to indicate and shift down to first gear and be checking my blindspots all at the same time. I have to do them one-by-one or else I straight up just don't do them.

At the end of this lesson I got the feeling I'm not progressing as quickly as he'd like (and he's a good teacher, he's super experienced by the sounds of it - driven all kinds of shit and has been teaching for like 20 years)... when roads get busy, I kinda relapse and he has to talk me through it all.

Now it's still early days, hopefully I won't take too long to get the hang of it (driving lessons are expensive!) but I was wondering what other aspie's experiences of learning to drive were like, I think it could be useful. e.g. does anyone have a good strategy for coping with all the multitasking and sequencing and sensory input you have to deal with when driving in busy places?

I am aware that, when it comes to driving with ASD, your mileage may vary (pun very much intended) and some for some people being an aspie will help them and for others it hinders and for others it doesn't affect their driving in the slightest - but if there's anyone else who suspects it being their crutch when it comes to driving, got any advice?",,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,,True,t3_16vk85,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/16vk85/autism_and_learning_to_drive/,

My friend (we'll call her Jane) was diagnosed with Aspergers early 2012. I didn't know about this diagnosis until about October of 2012. But throughout this entire year I have begun to find her behavior increasingly difficult to deal with. Jane had always been a bit quirky and sometimes could be a little out of touch with socially acceptable behavior but she was never terribly rude or anything like that. Mostly she was just funny and quirky.

However, in the past year she has become quite...blunt? Rude, overly confident in herself (more like arrogant), very demeaning of others, quite demanding. We are in college now and she has taken to insulting her friend's schools by saying things like ""*insert school here*, it's cute that you think it's a good school."" (this is, of course, referring to some of the top state schools - much better than the community college she's going to now because she thought she was too good for any instate schools and got waitlisted at her first (and only) choice.)  She argues that the only reason she goes to community college is because she can't afford anything else (she always talks about being poor which is really uncomfortable for a lot of us, and is also a new thing) but she ignores the fact that we chose good public schools because they were affordable for us. 

In addition to this, she has started to sort of 'pick fights', if you will. She'll start a conversation for the sole purpose of arguing and proving that she's right.

Finally, she won't stop talking about this boy that she dated for like six months who broke up with her summer before junior year. We're freshmen in college. She literally hasn't gotten over him yet. At the same time she criticized me for not being over my ex a few months after we broke up. The reason she was upset was because I was not talking about her, basically. This is also a recurring theme - she will get aggravated and mad if we don't just talk about her. Whenever we change the topic to something that isn't her, she feels the need to steer it back to her and her opinions.

We used to be really good friends. We were GREAT friends from about 6th grade to 11th. Then something happened, I'm not sure what. After she was diagnosed (and a little ways before that, too) she just became more...obnoxious, self-absorbed, and arrogant. She's convinced that she is smarter than all of us and literally a genius.

She won't EVER stop trying to talk to me, despite the fact that I'm busy with college life and social life. She is upset that I'm not at her beckon call at all times, and honestly I don't want to talk to her anymore because she is just really annoying to talk to. We used to talk every day and it would be fun but now it's a chore to interact with her at all.

Do you guys have any advice? Or insight? I would really, really love insight.

EDIT: You guys all gave really good advice. To be clear, a lot of this behavior is NEW - it wasn't present from 6th to 11th grade, and only started really appearing near the middle of 12th grade. I'm thinking that I might just sort of wean our friendship off as we grow apart; the thing is we are both part of a tight circle of friends and if I break off a friendship with her it would cause a lot of trouble among all of them. I think I'll end up attempting to maintain the friendship (I can't tell her that her behaviour is annoying because she is extremely stubborn and would tell me that I am wrong in some way) at least until it falls apart naturally.

My daughter is 7-Asperger's, ADHD, and diabetic to boot (no, she isn't fat). I can deal with most of her issues-food pickiness (even though that is hard with the diabetes), narrow interests, etc. But her defiance level is through the roof. At first the psych thought she was either early onset bipolar or ODD. 

Anytime we ask her to do something she doesn't want to do (try a new food, do her homework, etc) she throws a giant tantrum. We have tried all the good guy and bad guy approaches. Rewards, extra priviliges, removing priviliges, adding chores (which she refuses to do anyway), behavior charts, and even spanking (I hate spanking, but sometimes when your kid is inches away from running out into the busy street you do what you gotta do). None of those things work for long. The closest thing is the spanking. Once that happens, she will be compliant for about 15 minutes-long enough to accomplish most things. But again, I hate doing that. I feel so rotten. And she is already almost as big as me; what am I going to do when she is 16?

This morning, she was half an hour late to school because she didn't want to get out of bed. Long story short, we begged, yelled, threatened, and finally just gave up and let her cry herself out. She can't be late every morning, and this fight is really causing problems for our whole family (Me, husband, and other daughter). 

I am at my wit's end. What can I do?

TL;DR-Daughter with multiple issues is very defiant and I need help before we all lose our sanity.

Edit: My last resort is sending her to an outpatient school. I am trying to avoid that because we just got a new ARD for her, and she just started two clubs and I am overjoyed at her desire to socialize.

I don't mean to offend anyone at all with this, I am just very confused on what aspergers really is. 

My brother can be extremely rude sometimes. He can also be very nice sometimes. A typical day for him is to have my mom wake him up every morning &amp; have him refuse to go to school. If she does get him to go, then when he comes home he goes to his room &amp; sits on his computer the whole day. If he refuses to go to school, my mom will try to take his computer away from him, but usually he doesn't let her, or she doesn't take it away. He usually gets whatever he wants when he wants it. His behavior can be really obnoxious sometimes. For example, the other day I was trying to finish an art project by pulling an all-nighter &amp; he insisted on mocking me &amp; trying to annoy me. It seemed like he didn't care even when I was getting upset. He does this a lot, only to the point where he won't leave until he gets bored. 

He is also very clingy to my mom. He always wants to give her hugs, or pat her on the head, &amp; if she doesn't give him the attention he will not leave her alone. He doesn't have many friends. He had one, but he hardly ever talks to him anymore. He has some at school, but doesn't want them to come over to our house. Is him being so attached to my mom because he doesn't have many friends?

I worry about him, too. He shows no effort to do anything. He does not want to get a job anytime soon &amp; he is graduating this year. He is now going to a special school for kids with special needs &amp; autism because he never did his work in his last school and the school could not handle him. (That's at least what I know about the situation, there may have been other reasons why, for example him being bullied).

He is a VERY smart guy, and can be really nice. I am just wondering if there is any reason why he does all these things that relates to his autism? I highly doubt all of this relates, because a lot of this is probably him being a really big jerk. I just want some help understanding him, because when I talk to my mom about it the only things she tells me is that people with aspergers have a harder time giving empathy, and get irritated easily (which both of these seem to explain him pretty well).

I don't mean to offend anyone, because I was reading some other people asking similar things that I am asking now, and in the comments people get offended. I am just wondering how much of this relates to autism, because I am not educated on aspergers.

The other day I saw a picture on the front page that was a bunch of dead cows who had been electrocuted by a fallen power line and had all, presumably at different times, walked unknowingly into the lethal electrical charge.  That pic made me really sad.  I felt bad for the emotional ache the owners would feel.  (I assumed they felt an emotional attachment to the animals, like I do with my cat, when they very well could only have been hurt monetarily by the deaths.)

As I said, I can't think of any specific, obvious, concrete examples of completely real, nature empathy outside of things having to do with animals.  Maybe I do have less empathy than the normal person? (I'm just writing stream of consciousness, I haven't even gotten to what I WANTED to write about.  I really like having this sub to talk about aspie things that I can't talk about with other people, and thank you to those who read, even though I don't have an actual point in the end of this thing...just talking about myself!)  I can remember trying to force myself to feel bad for people in emotionally rough situations.  This friend of mine in high school struggled with self harm and bulimia and I knew that I cared about her, and I knew that I wanted her to feel better...but I didn't actually feel any emotional attachment to her emotional state.  I didn't REALLY want to listen to her.  But I'd feel guilty for that.  

My emotion in that situation reflects many of the ""learned"" emotions or reactions I have.  Self taught feeling and thoughts that I've learned from NTs I should have when I hear bad news about someone, but I don't actually feel bad.

Not missing people is the only really solid area where I can point out and say ""hey, look there, I don't care, I don't know why people care, I feel no guilt about not caring.""

""Byes"" me nothing to me.  I worked at a summer camp for the past few summers and at the end every year people are always teary eyed and hugging good bye and every year I dread it because I really would just rather leave.  I got my license a couple years late and so finally, last year, I was able to leave RIGHT when all the staff were dismissed after the last day without waiting for a ride...and ESPECIALLY without having to wait around while everyone said goodbye.  

Later it turned out some people were pretty annoyed about that.

I don't get it.  Most of them I'd see again, and I didn't, I didn't.  If I wanted to keep in touch with them, I would.  If we hardly knew each other, we hardly knew each other, there was no reason to pretend like we did.  It is the same with all good byes.  I will see you again.  If I don't, I don't.  

Sometimes, in a long absence, people are afraid of someone dying and never seeing them again.  My mom died when I was a kid.  It was out of the blue, she wasn't sick for a long time or anything, so my last words to her were just normal everyday stuff.  That has never bothered me.  I never felt I need ""closure"" or ""to say goodbye.""  She was gone, that was it.  Having been able to say good bye a last time wouldn't change anything about that or anything about everything that has happened since.

My sister is moving across the world in a week and I really don't care.  I'll see her again in 2 years.  Okay.  That is fine.  I am not emotionally close to her.  When we spend time together (occasionally) it is enjoyable but she isn't someone I actively try to spend more time with.  But the family of course has been calling me and making sure I'll be coming to all the family get togethers and grandparent dinners over the next week, because apparently when someone leaves you need to pretend to like them more and spend more time with them than you normally do?

This is just something I don't fully understand, and I think that's an aspie thing.

Also, If I thought anyone would want to keep reading, I'd pontificate onto the topic of family and how I'm astounded by the fact that blood connection is supposed to have some sort of significance.

I am 27/F and we have been married 8 years.",16,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/zkzza/it_was_suggested_that_i_post_this_here_i_really/,"There is a lot I COULD say but I'll keep it as brief as I can.

We've been having a lot of struggles lately because of his workaholism and general lack of affection towards me. I get very little physical affection or romantic attention. No flower, or little ""I love you"" messages in the day. No cuddling. No, ""Wanna hang out with me tonight?"" Let me be clear - there is no malicious intent on his part. It is like he just doesn't register that kind of affection as something someone might need.

Like a lot of people on the Aspergers side of things, he is very bright and talented. He is a successful writer and animator and thrives on his work. His expresses himself most clearly through art, and separating him from his work is very difficult. He is what he does. I believe the primary way he shows his love for me is by sharing his art and ideas with me. He really comes alive at these times. However, I feel lonely in our relationship a lot of the time and, quite frankly, brushed aside.

I go out of my way to accept the affection he offers on his own terms. But I am also a person with my own needs. I need to feel emotional connection and acceptance. I need physical closeness and I often am left feeling my affection is an intrusion on his work. It is very difficult to get him to open up and talk about his emotions. When I try, especially about sensitive topics, he gets very distant and cold and grunts one word answers, rarely offering me insight into his true thoughts and feelings (outside of the realms of art and ideas.) He very rarely cries.

Being an animator, we watch a lot of animated films. Tonight, we saw ParaNorman. He cried for about 10 minutes at the beginning and periodically through the film. I held his hand and asked him if he wanted to leave and he said no.

After the film, we started talking. I could tell he was feeling very fragile. At the start of the film, Norman, a very gentle kid with a fierce love of all things monster related. Norman can see and talk to dead people. He is mocked for this by both family and the people in the community. He is very lonely and often bullied. His parents just want him to be a normal kid. They can't recognize his ""weirdness"" as a kind of superpower.

My husband loved film, especially genre films and pulp (consumed MST3K, still watches it daily) and has a very keen mind. For his pet subjects, his mind is like a trap. He is very successful in his career and it is a deep part of who he is.

He was constantly chided by his father and largely misunderstood by his mother. ""Why can't you just draw nice things, not that weird stuff?"" ""Movies are stupid. Why would I take you to a movie?"" ""Why would you want to make cartoons? You'll never get good at something like that."" To top it off, we were raised in a pretty intense ""high demand religious group"" (in common lingo, cult.) Sameness was the name of the game. You didn't have your own thoughts and opinions. If you did you had a ""bad attitude.""

He told me at school he was quite bullied. He went through some awkward years, like we all did. Braces with headgear. Acne. Struggling to make friends. And kids were quite mean, even calling him ugly to his face.

When Nightmare Before Christmas came out, he wanted to see it more than anything, being into cartooning and animation and the macabre. But it was absolutely forbidden. He was chided for being bad, thinking demonic thoughts and told he was stupid for desiring something like that. ""You have a bad attitude"" was a common refrain.

At this point, a little stunned, I said, ""It seems like you grew up in a home where you really weren't able to express yourself."" He answered, ""Oh, I expressed myself. I couldn't help it. I have the bruises to prove it."" We determined that this is probably why he rarely shares his deepest thoughts with me, especially if they are scary or sad. What I experience as being rejected emotionally by him is really just him having years of training to shove those feelings down deep and not tell them to anyone.

Does anyone have any advice for living with and loving someone like this? I don't want to be another person in his life who makes him feel weird. But I do want to know him deeply and have him share himself intimately with me, even and especially his hurts. I also need a relationship where my needs, which are still real, are met. But I need to do that in a way that doesn't send a message that he, as he is, isn't good enough for me. Please help me. We have been on the verge of breaking up lately because I feel so lonely and neglected by the man I love.

Thanks. Sorry that was long.

Edit: Before anyone says, ""Tell him all this stuff. Tell him what you just told us."" I want you to know that I DO do this regularly and am very clear in expressing what I need. We DO talk. But it seems to not be going very well. I need to change my tactics and that is what I'm here asking for. How do I change my tactics so he and I both get the love we want and need, in the way that we specifically need it?

I don't mean ""do you love them"" because of course you do. But I'm curious what that feels like to you? What struggles you have with your aspergers and having kids?

My husband's father (I'll call him my FIL here for father-in-law) is in his early 70s and he has never been officially diagnosed but it seems to me very obvious that he has aspergers.

My FIL and his wife have never been good about going to doctors, dentists, etc so it's no surprise that he never has been diagnosed and never will be. And since he's in his 70's, he grew up in a time where people just had no idea about aspergers etc. (If anything I bet his aspergers resulted in lots of emotional damage due to lack of understanding it.)

My husband says that growing up his father demonstrated no caring or love or bonding towards his kids. Today, just as a small example, we met up with my FIL and MIL and my FIL immediately went and shook my infant girl's foot and made some some quick ""goo goo"" baby sounds and then immediately asked if it was time to go home yet.

I'm SURE my FIL's lack of emotion for his kids and grandkids is on the extreme end of things. I personally think it comes from a lifetime of other kinds of dysfunction coupled with no one ever diagnosing / acknowledging / treating his aspergers.

But I'm curious to hear what some aspie parents would say about their relationships with and feelings towards their kids?",,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,,True,t3_uisx4,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/uisx4/aspie_parents_how_do_you_feel_about_your_kids/,

Not sure what I can do.,14,3,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/tmhh9/my_sons_school_is_driving_me_nuts_not_sure_what_i/,"Ok. So, my son is 8 and has Aspergers.  He's really high functioning, but still on the spectrum.  We recently got an IEP with the school (which was an uphill battle the whole way) and I don't like any of the goals they set for him, they're stupid and don't address the things he really needs help with at school. 

His two biggest issues at school are attention and meltdowns.  I understand it is difficult for them to distinguish between a plain old temper tantrum from a normal kid and my son's meltdowns, but as those of you on this sub know, they are very different.  His school simply punishes him.  They refused to let him on the last class field trip as punishment for having a meltdown and today they excluded him from the end-of-school party coming up for the same reason.  

When I talk to them about it, they always fall back on the ""well he needs to know he can't behave that way"" and punishment is good blah blah blah.  They don't try to step in as they see him failing to deal with whatever the issue is, they don't wait until he has calmed down to talk to him, they think giving him lots of chances is sufficient in helping him manage his meltdowns. 

 He doesn't have too many meltdowns here at home because I can recognize them and usually diffuse them.  I am not able to duplicate the school environment to help my son practice what to do in those situations.  Is it wrong of me to expect the school to work with him in that way?  Or that I don't think he should have the types of punishments he gets for the reasons he gets them?

Edit:  THanks to everyone who commented.  I know I am not crazy now, nor expecting too much.  I will be using an advocate the next time we have an IEP meeting for him, no matter what school he is at, and he certainly won't be at that school next year, even if I have to homeschool him.

It can even feel like you'll be forever alone, desperate, but other Aspergers have succeeded, and so can you. Based on my experiences, here are two things that may help:

1 - Play to your strengths i.e. use non-face-to-face communication. For instance, Aspergers can excel at interactions via chat and email where non-verbal cues are nonexistent for both parties -- it's all text. And with ""Asperger focusing powers"", there tends to be an advantage once you've practiced (you can't expect to be good and know what to say immediately, but behind the anonymity of the internet you can practice all you want). 

It works best if there's a viable means to meet people anonymously - such as public chat rooms. There tend to be less of these now-a-days, I've seen Omegle for instance and I think Yahoo Chat has pretty much expired. Back in the late 90s, AOL used to be a good place to meet regular people in public chat rooms. And yes, long-lasting real-world relationships can start from those meetings.

2 - ""Bookish English-major"" types and Aspergers tend to have high compatibility. The bookish english-major types are not Aspergers themselves, but they tend to be comfortable alone with their books for days on end and don't require as much social interaction as the typical person. They also enjoy reading and writing, which gives you the chance to use non-face-to-face communication to court them i.e. chat/email/real-letters-sealed-with-wax. They will tend to appreciate your intense loyalty to them and your lack of ability to lie -- they feel safe/secure with you.

If someone asks me something I also occasionally repeat what they say and then answer. I always thought this was really weird and tried to stop doing it.

I have a strong interest in space and science, but I'm kind of oblivious to a lot of other things.

And I don't have any friends either..

---------------

First off, I was finally officially diagnosed with Asperger's.  I recently heard about it, suspected I had it, and wanted to confirm/deny it.

[This girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Z4iqrezAU) talks about these 3 types, and I think I'm currently a combination of actor and loner.  As a child, I was definitely the outcast.

An important element she discusses is that our condition doesn't prohibit us from adapting.  I, myself, have trained and self-taught myself, albeit for over 10 years, how to transform from an outcast to an actor.  I certainly still have issues, but I now see the value AND enjoy socializing.  People tend to enjoy what they're good at, and I think many aspies hate socializing as a defense/coping mechanism.

---------------

**EDIT:** Just realized that my last paragraph can be offensive (ha, one of my aspie weaknesses that I'm always working on).  I think some aspies also hate socializing simply because they don't understand the need for it.  I've actually spent some time studying the benefits of it.  It's not necessary for mere zoo-like existence, but it's an incredible bonus to our quality of lives.  Once I've intellectualized this, I was able to make this a *conviction* (genuine belief), and then make it a value and thus automatized virtues could be created.

Yes, our weaknesses can be attributed to Asperger's, but that's not a good excuse.  We still can take action to improve ourselves.",,False,,t5_2rm6u,1376249547.0,,,True,t3_1k52al,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1k52al/do_you_fit_into_one_of_the_3_basic_subtypes_and/,

I felt as though 'something wasn't right' for quite some time. However, I was achieving good grades in school and so didn't really think much of it. 

I started to struggle when I reached my A Levels, and finally got my diagnosis last year. I saw my psychologist for a little while after my diagnosis, to undergo CBT.  My situation since 2010 has been I practically live in my bed room. I have no friends, I don't work, I don't socialise or anything. My psychologists solution to this was to just tell me to ""go and meet people"". Obviously that's difficult for *anyone* let alone someone with ASD. After a few months she said ""I think it's best I stop seeing you, we're getting nowhere and it's wasting my time"".

This experience has obviously jaded my views and has put me off from seeing professionals. The problem arises when I am worried I suffer from things other than just ASD. I don't wish to go to a professional though, due to this experience. 

I suffer from severe paranoia, to the extent where it affects my day-to-day life. I spent some time reading up on Paranoid Personality Disorder among various other PD's and came across a few tests for them. I know online tests are generally 100% useless. However, the tests I took before seeing my psychologist to do with my ASD proved to be very accurate and almost identical to that which she had me take in person.

After taking a few different tests and quite a lot of reading, they all seem to come to a common conclusion of scoring me very highly in a few different PD's. Paranoid, Antisocial, Borderline, Avoidant, Dependant and Obsessive-Compulsive.

On top of this, I also have suspicions of Alexithymia, which has a rather high co-morbidity with ASD. I realise a lot of these disorders cross-over quite a lot with ASD itself, this coupled with my lack of desire to see a professional makes me wonder if there's much point in looking into seeing someone? I've been having an extremely difficult time coping lately, and to add to the above, both my sister and father insult me and use my ASD to attack me as they don't believe there's any such thing. I feel hopeless and lost currently, having no friends or anyone to talk to, and no form of support for my problems; either from friends, family or local authorities/charities. 

One thing that makes things slightly more difficult is my 100% reluctance to take any form of medication. The many side effects of medication used for these types of things scares me and I would prefer to avoid it completely. 

I'm not entirely sure what I aimed to achieve with this post, I just felt the need to express myself I suppose.",,False,,t5_2rm6u,False,,,True,t3_1jn8ys,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1jn8ys/21_year_old_male_diagnosed_with_aspergers_last/,
1375362850.0,12,self.aspergers,1jhpib,Recently found out I have aspergers: Something I need to get off my chest and what to do now?,19,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1jhpib/recently_found_out_i_have_aspergers_something_i/,"Hello all, it's 5 a.m and I am right now laying in bed typing away what I have to say right now. It's pretty long since I have so much to say and I only talk to myself about these issues alone most of the time so bear with me. 

Well, let's start it off right. I am a 21 year old male and I have recently found out that I have aspergers. It came as an initial surprise for me even though the OBVIOUS signs were already present from the start. I knew I was really really weird, but I never figured that it would be aspergers. I had asked my mom that I might have had some form of disorder after having looked back at all the signs and having looked up similar traits online and having taken the RS something test (I scored double than the borderline rate). She confessed that I indeed have had aspergers and only her and my older sister knew. It honestly opened up my eyes a bit as to who I am and I figured I could reflect on what I have been dealing with this whole time.

I have always felt that I have had something different and off about me ever since I was five years old. I remember developing this OCD type of disorder at the age of five. I still remember it vividly, my mind took over my actions and as a little kid I would get this dreadful mind voice that spoke bad things all the time. I remember waking up one night and all of a sudden my voice inside my head would taunt me by saying over and over again bad things (which I would rather not say due to it being ridiculous and not making sense, I've tried so hard explaining to people but I feel no one got what I was dealing with as a five year old up to 10). My OCD was tolerable but really annoying. At one point I couldn't even say certain words, walk a certain number, or even swallow my food without thinking of ""good things"". 

I'll give you an example of the hell I dealt with: When I was ten I couldn't touch my left knee without my brain (that's what I call the voice) threatening me and scaring me by telling me that if I don't touch my right knee after having touched my left knee, bad things would happen (death, someone dying, horror movie scenarios happening in real life). 

Other than my OCD and the voice ruining my life for a bit. I have always been that ""weird""  kid in school that everyone would love to pick on and stray away from. I was always a quite shy type. Each grade year varied as to how weird I would be. I remember wearing a sweater all year round (even through the summer) in grade school up to high school. Kids in school would refer to me as that weird/ crazy/ dumb/shy kid due to the fact that would do the most eccentric things (carry a Halloween mask to school/ bury a dead bird in elementary / make jokes about irrelevant things that no one got ).I would go to classrooms and take a seat staring down and not talking to anybody due to my fear of opening up and being judged. When it came to teachers in HIGH SCHOOL, I would write on paper what I was trying to say, something I could have done easily if I had just opened my mouth, but I couldn't find the comfort in doing so. I would stand alone in lunch as a freshmen in high school lost in my own world. I came up with a lot of creative stories and such in my head as I stood alone in lunch away from the ordinary people. I just couldn't understand how one socialized, I was trapped in a shell that couldn't let me be normal. 

The things I say to people, the things I do in front of them is pretty awkward and weird. I can't hold a conversation with regular people without over analyzing  everything and saying one to two words in an awkward manner. I usually let other friends take part in a conversation and just sit back staring at the floor or something. I have friends, but when it comes to interacting with other people that are not close to me, I get really shy and tend to hold back a lot of things I would want to say. Sometimes I would say things to people but later on tell myself ""man I should have mentioned this! or that!"" ""why did I say it that way?! Now they are gonna think I was being an asshole!"" The list goes on and on... I have always questioned how one socializes. I always, in my life, never understood or grasped the concept behind being a ""normal"" person. I have honestly tried really hard to do normal things but in the end I always end up being this ""weird"" person I am. All I want out of this is to just be a ""regular"",  just another spoke on the wheel much like everyone else, but the act of speaking and being comfortable around others without worrying too much really gets to me.

Now I am 21 years turning 22. Here's the thing. I felt that I have missed out on a lot of things in life that normal people have accomplished in their younger days. I was never really the type of outdoor-socially-weekend -party- adventuring  teenager due to my inability to gain friends in high school. I missed out on a lot of fun times with my friends. I hear them describe the stories of when they partied and had fun back in high school and college and it depresses me because I wasn't there. It's these thoughts that make me sad because I am living in the present and I can't change the past. Time fucking sucks. Basically, I feel that I am getting old and that I am in a phase where I just want to make up what I have missed out, but at the same time I want to change myself and improve my social incapability that I suffer. I have never been in a relationship as I feel really shy even talking about women in general. My greatest fear is dying alone and not having experienced the feeling of having someone there and  loved by someone who makes you happy and understands how you are as a person. I am just a big pile of mess and it all is depressing the shit out of me. I have those thoughts. Those thoughts of falling asleep and hoping that I could be another person but sadly the world does not work like that.

Overall, what should I do to improve myself when it comes to talking to people? Should I just pull a ""fuck it"" and just not be afraid of saying what I want to say but can't say? It feels as though I can't understand anything about the rules behind  a conversation, or behaving properly. I don't understand  that what I say sometimes is wrong to say and people might take offense. I just don't know any of this crap. I have for a long time told myself that if anything, society is far too up its ass and that you can't be something without having people preach or bitch about what you do. I have way more to say but I will leave it as that. Just shed some light and give me some advice.

oh and I am left handed too (left handed in everything).
