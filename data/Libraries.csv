1360803128.0,129,self.Libraries,18hczo,"Fellow Librarians, who is your weirdest regular patron? Here's mine.",146,17,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/18hczo/fellow_librarians_who_is_your_weirdest_regular/,"I work at a small library, so I don't get to swap stories with other librarians very regularly. Let's hear who YOU have to deal with!

For a small library in a fairly rural area, we get a fair amount of weird people in-- but only a handful are regulars. The weirdest regular by far is ""Prince Valiant."" The Prince is so named (by us, the staff) for his bowl-shaped haircut, just like the comic character, and his medieval bathing habits. I'm not sure what he does in his spare time to smell like burning rubber and compost, but it must be a daily routine. Obviously I can't tell you Prince Valiant's real name, but I can tell you he's legally changed it to include the nickname of his dead girlfriend.

Prince Valiant bicycles from a slummy tenant house 6 miles away about 2-3 times a week in order to use our internet and check out literally dozens of cds. His wallet is a filthy piece of cardboard from a Coke carton, wrapped in an equally filthy plastic bag. He insists on touching your fingers when he presents his library card.

The Prince LOVES to talk to anyone he can corner-- and by talk, I mean batter people with nonsensical gibberish even as they walk quickly in the opposite direction. We've had to ban him from the library several times for this. He especially loves to talk about his relationship problems. He also becomes obsessed by small things and won't shut up about them-- such as the time there was a small glitch in his signing out of Facebook, and he went on and on about security problems and people trying to take his identity, etc. He wanted to stay at the computer until the library shut down, convinced it was the only way to protect his account.

Yes, the Prince actually does have mental issues, and was in jail and/or a treatment facility for a few years. However, he's completely nonviolent. Honestly though, I'd rather have him punch me so I could A) beat him upside the head with a bookend and B) ban him for life if he survived. He's a small guy, and I have years of pent-up rage on my side.

It's not the smell, the talking or even the weirdness. It's regular incidents that push my buttons. Like this:

The Prince once brought in a live kitten, unbeknownst to us, and at the end of a two-hour internet session asked if I wanted to see what was in his coat pocket. Despite my vehement protests, he reached in and produced the poor thing. It dangled from his fingers with a numb look of misery. I'm sure it died later.

I hate you, Prince Valiant.

Reddit: you know what to do!,55,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/kly63/the_only_library_in_the_smallest_city_in_the/,"With Central Falls, RI about to file for bankruptcy this past summer, it first eliminated funding for the Adams Memorial Library. Within a month,[ volunteers reopened the library](http://www.pawtuckettimes.com/content/volunteers-keep-cf-library-alive), staffing it for fifteen hours/week - not enough, though, to qualify for state funding.


So: we're throwing a [fundraiser](http://www.golocalprov.com/lifestyle/dont-miss-gala-for-central-falls-historic-adams-library/) September 30th to expand hours, hire a library director and, ultimately, help transition the 101-year institution into a Library of the Future where patrons can:

* become computer literate
* register to vote
* get passports
* access municipal records
* pay taxes, utility bills and municipal fees/fines

and much, much more.

Central Falls has the poorest citizens in the state and it's complete BS that the city and state can't keep their library open. As it's often said, as goes CF, so goes the country.

Please buy a ticket to the fundraiser (open bar, live music, etc.) or donate [here](http://cflibrary.org/gala).

And if you can pass along [this invite](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-asgMJ47V7xg/Tml10Uc-MWI/AAAAAAAAAek/ruxO-BM9PhU/s1000/Adams_Gala_Invite.gif) to like-minded folk, so much the better.

I was wondering who the members of the librarian community (librarian and other library staff) on Reddit are. What is our expertise? What is the size of your library? Is it a family library, or an academic library? Perhaps this post will become a failure, or perhaps we all create a small contact sheet with experts in certain areas. That would be neat.

A balding middle aged patron was watching rap videos on YouTube. More power to him, but he soon began rapping. Not just mouthing the words, or quietly enjoying keeping rhythm, but full on I’m on stage and hundreds of adoring fans need to hear what I have to say. 

I calmly approached and tapped on the desk.

“Sir.” I began, waving my hands downward. Most people understand this to mean they they are being to loud and correct their behavior. This guy wasn’t having it. “Sir,” again I motioned, “could you please keep your voice...”  

He stood up, headphones still on, and rapped at me. He started doing a little dance, half running man half chicken. Other patrons started to take notice, pointing and giggling.

This is really happening, I thought. Not sure what else to do, I reached over and turned off his computer. The music blaring from his headphones stopped, he did not. He ripped the headphones from his head, threw them with a thud to the desk and shouted “who do you think you are? How old are you, boy? I’m a grown man!”

“I’m not sure what that has to do with anything, but your volume is disturbing others...”

“You Urkel-lookin’ bitch mother fucker!”

I never saw myslef as resembling one of the many heroes of my youth (Urkel was second only to the Ninja Turtles), but in my confusion, I took is almost as a complement. The vulgarity of the comment faded into the background and I stood proud with a renewed understanding of who I was. I was a librarian, resolute and impervious to your oddly worded verbal assault. It was almost humorous, I had to bite my lip.

“Sir, you need to leave right now.”

We are fortunate enough to receive a lot of donationed books from library patrons. These books are sorted through- if they are in good condition and we don't already have a copy, they are added into into our collection. If not, they go to the sale table.

Recently a hardcover copy of JK Rowling's 'The Casual Vacancy' was donated. Now, I remember when this book came out last year, my boss said something to the effect of 'our patrons don't want to read that garbage' Apparently it got bad reviews and had swear words in it. I suspected the issues were largely my boss's personal preferences as she is a conservatively religious person- but I also thought maybe she didn't want to risk having someone complain about how she was spending county money.

Anyway, the point of my story is this- she refuses to put the donated, in good condition hardcover copy of this book in our collection. When I asked her why, she said people told her it wasn't very good and 'No one want to read it' I persisted asked her how many people told her this, and she got flustered and stammered that ten people had told her this and she wasn't going to put it in. She said if someone really wants to read it, they can request it from another library.

Isn't this crossing a line? I didn't think it was the place of library staff to decide what was 'good' or 'bad'.

I was hoping someone from this sub might have some wisdom or insight into the situation. 

Background: The patron is a registered sex offender. He is a tall, middle-aged male and large enough to be physically imposing. He has a habit of fixating on female staff and repeatedly asking them questions both in person and on the phone (he calls *constantly*) of a suggestive nature. Examples: ""What are treatment options for STD's?"" ""Can you tell me if _____ actress has ever been in Playboy and how I would go about getting a copy?"" ""Can you read me a plot synopsis of *Fifty Shades of Grey*?"" These questions are inappropriate, but presented as normal reference questions, putting staff in a very awkward situation. Also, on one night when our security officer was out sick, he hovered around staff cars after we closed and made everyone *very* uncomfortable.

 He is a consistent enough problem to be a source of anxiety for several staff members, but his behavior just hasn't been extreme enough for us or our supervisors to feel like there is any punitive action we can take. If anyone on this subreddit has dealt with a similar situation and wouldn't mind giving some insight as to how it was dealt with at your library, I would really appreciate this input.

Questions for current librarians.,38,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1gr428/thinking_of_becoming_a_librarian_questions_for/,"Hello. I've included a little personal background if that helps you with responding to my questions, but if you don't care you can skip this paragraph. So, I'm thinking I would make a great librarian and that it would be something I would enjoy doing long-term as a career. I am two years out of college. I got a BA in English Language and Literature from a good school. I got good grades (3.8 gpa) and got a job soon after graduation at a small academic publishing house that I interned for during college. But here's the thing. I HATE my job as an assistant editor. I mean, I really really hate it. My girlfriend used to be a page at a library for several years and suggested I look into being a librarian. I think it's a job that would suit my personality and my interests. I'm smart, but I'm pretty low-key and low-stress. I'm not lazy, and I do work hard when I'm engaged and excited about something. However, I don't like things to be too fast-paced or extremely high pressure. I am not aggressively social, but I am polite and courteous. I work hard when I care about the job, but if I don't care my work ethic suffers in equal proportion. I have a great deal of knowledge about literature and books (partly from education and partly from work experience.) 

Anyway, with that in mind, I have a few questions for you guys. Please feel free to answer all, some, or none. Any help is much appreciated!

1. What drew you to the librarian profession?
2. I know that some librarian jobs don't require an MLS but do require a BA. Do libraries tend never to hire people unless they have a MLS or are pursuing one? Should I just go ahead and get one right now? I was planning on getting a job at the library and then working on my MLS, but I'm having a hard time getting my foot in the door. Thoughts?
3. How long did it take you to get your MLS? Did it break the bank?
4. What kind of person do you think makes a good librarian?
5. How much of your time is divided between technical research stuff and actually working with patrons and books on the floor?
6. Do you see yourself working at the library indefinitely? Is this a long-term career choice for you?
7. Do libraries care if you got your MLS online if the program is accredited? Is accreditation the only thing that matters or do they like to see certain schools or programs?
8. Do you feel overburdened or constantly stressed? Do you find yourself juggling lots of projects and feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work? (This is one thing I dislike about my current job.)
9. Do you like your coworkers? The atmosphere? Do you look forward to going to work?
10. Any other advice, insight, or whatever is welcome! 

I know this is a long post, sorry about that. Please feel free to answer as you see fit; I'm really just looking to get a sense of things to make sure this is the right fit for me. I'm fairly confident it is, but I do want some insight.

I wrote all this stuff, not realizing how angry I was about my experience.  Then I freaked out because I don't have my degree in my hand and the survey isn't anonymous, so I erased my comments.  This is probably too harsh, but I want to get these things off my chest, so I copied them into a word document to paste here. Sorry if this offends anyone. So, how was your MLIS program?

What elements of the program hindered your academic progress (e.g., frequency of course offerings, accuracy and timeliness of advising, relevance of course offerings)?

The university misrepresented its services.  I applied to and was accepted by, what I believed, was a legitimate program.  After being enrolled for a semester, everything was shifted from real classroom learning, with professorial involvement, onto blackboard self-management chat.  There is no reason to pay the massive amount of money I paid for this, it is just a chat board where the professors moderate discussion, there was a serious lack of insight by the staff. There was no actual instruction!  The university basically charged me to say ""go read about what you think the industry is about, post on message boards!"" 
I truly hope the university loses its ALA accreditation.  I am incensed by how little this program cares about actually furthering...anything.  I think the SISLT program is an actual fucking scam.  I work 40 hours a week on campus, and it is the only time I'm on campus.  I do not know any of my peers, I do not have a building to call home, and my adviser has always avoided meeting me or giving me one, just one, piece of fucking advice.   You got my money, way to go.  

What elements of the program helped you to achieve your academic and professional goals?

Myself, mostly.  I paid my alma mater thousands of dollars to dick around on the computer, teach myself, and build connections through services I found outside of the university's guidance.  The only resources the university provided me, after it moved to a purely chat based ""teaching"" model was access to database and journals, so I'm sure you'll fucking cut those soon.

What services/resources would have appreciably strengthened the quality of your graduate student experience in the College of Education?

I would have loved to have had a couple of professors, maybe a classroom or two, an adviser who would meet me face-to-face, and we would have all benefited if the college of education thought information specialists were something more than a cash cow. Some semblance of human interaction!  A chat room is not an education.  I hope there is another place to say ""Fuck You"" on this form, but in case there isn't: Fuck You.

Please share more about your satisfaction with your coursework and curriculum.

What coursework?  Is there even a failure rate? You literally charge us thousands of dollars to chat about what we are reading with other people who are reading the same thing.   

Have to add this on because it warms my heart:

As you complete your degree and most likely prepare to exit the College of Education, how prepared do you feel to enter your chosen profession? 

Not joking, ""far too much"" is an option.

Though we have never met, this email is being sent to you because of your well known and widely reported generous nature and the high esteem in which you are held throughout the statewide van delivery system. My name is Name Changed to Protect the Innocent and my father was the famed late Nigerian Prince and Head of Interlibrary Loans who you are sure to be well aware of due to your great and impressive knowledge of world happenings and events. You must have
heard of the huge sums of books and other sundry library materials which my father was stockpiling in order that they might be dispersed freely to library patrons throughout your great state. I assure you that I can be trusted in the utmost when I tell you that in his secret underground vaults there are housed vast riches including and not limited to books, audiobooks, and videos, in both the DVD as well as the rare and highly valued VHS format. Since this wealth is so great and deserving of awe that I cannot enjoy it all in my brief lifetime, it would make my heart blossom like an onion deep fried in hot oil to be able to share it with you. All I require from you is for you to follow my instructions closely because I am experienced in interlibrary loan shipping matters and I will give you most excellent advice so that you may receive these cultural and intellectual riches. What is humbly required of you is to *transfer as many empty delivery bags of any size as you can spare to the LIBRARY NAME CHANGED TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT*. Once the bags have been received here I assure you that everything will go smooth like smoky baba ghanoush and you will have the previously mentioned items in your hands within 3 to 4 business days (or possibly 1 day later in the event of a Monday holiday). Anticipating to hear from you soon. Many thanks and one million blessings be upon you. Also, it is asked that you please have a great weekend.

Pretty new to reddit, but I've really jumped in head first with discussions. On a recent thread where people discussed their biggest let downs, I talked about my MLS program. I'm disappointed about some of my peers and by the tediousness of some of the material I'm learning. I LOVE libraries, working in libraries, I'm passionate about information and research, I'm excited to help develop collections and programs, and all of that. So, please don't get me wrong. This is what I want to do with my life.

Anyway, some people tore into me with ""Omg, you are literally the only person on the planet who thought that an MLS program would have passionate or creative people in it..."" But the majority are people saying things like, ""Why do you even need a Master's to be a librarian? It's all researching the Dewey Decimal System and telling people to 'ssshhh'"" Someone else said the following today- ""Why do you need a Masters to be a librarian? Is there something about the job I am missing? Also how much do Librarians make? I assumed it was a uneducated position that made minimum wage...""

I'm frustrated because I believe that each librarian should be an advocate of the field. If we don't defend and promote our positions, no one else is going to do it for us. I don't feel like there's enough of that going on, obviously! Why do people not understand that being a librarian is so much more than shelving books? I've worked as a paraprofessional in a library before, and *that* job was so much more than shelving books.

Have you librarians here run into a lot of this kind of thing? Please help a girl new to reddit and new to the field. Thanks!

Will You Stand for Privacy?

A Message to ALA Members from ALA President Barbara Stripling

 

In early June, reports of the National Security Agency’s secret practices rang loudly around the world. News reports detailed PRISM, the U.S. government surveillance program that obtains the Internet records from ten U.S. companies: Verizon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple. It appears that phone records, emails, photos, and social networking activities have been collected and catalogued by the FBI and the NSA over the last seven years.

 

ALA is saddened by recent news that the government has obtained vast amounts of personal information and electronic communications of millions of innocent people. The extent of the personal information received by the government is very troubling. Those of you who have been long-time members of ALA know that we have always argued that provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act encroach on the privacy expectations of library users. Worse, the surveillance law erodes our basic First Amendment rights, all while undermining the very fabric of our democracy.

 

When we spoke out in 2001 against the passage of the PATRIOT Act, we were concerned about Section 215, a provision of the law that allowed the government powers to obtain “business records and other tangible things” from suspected terrorists. We were fearful that the government would come into libraries without warning and take library records on individual patrons without reasonable suspicion. Libraries were one of the first groups to publicly oppose the bill, and many legislators and privacy experts have noted that Congress would not have understood the chilling impact on privacy if librarians had not brought it to the nation’s attention. Librarians were so vocal in their opposition to the law that Section 215 was called the ""library provision."" We could not have imagined then what is happening today. Today, in spite of the leak allegations, the government continues to use the “library provision” to vacuum up private communication records of Americans on a massive scale.

 

Even the most cynical among us could not have predicted that the Obama Administration—an administration that campaigned on the promise of greater government transparency and openness—would allow a massive surveillance program to infringe upon the basic civil liberties of innocent, unsuspecting people. We understand the responsibility of the government to investigate terrorism and other harmful acts. But the need to protect the public does not mean that Americans have to relinquish their Fourth Amendment privacy rights in the process. ALA has already joined other civil liberties groups to call for more legal review, judicial oversight, transparency and public accountability. Our country needs to find the right balance.

 

We need to restore the balance between individual rights and terrorism prevention, and libraries are one of the few trusted American institutions that can lead true public engagement on our nation’s surveillance laws and procedures. Libraries have the tools, resources and leaders that can teach Americans about their First Amendment privacy rights and help our communities discuss ways to improve the balance between First Amendment rights and government surveillance activities. And patrons are ready to learn about their privacy rights from their libraries.

 

Next Steps: Be a Leader at Your Library

 

We are calling on librarians to facilitate local public dialogues and educational sessions on government surveillance and transparency. To help libraries convene privacy forums and moderate public conversations, ALA is launching [“ALA Liberty,”](http://maildogmanager.com/link.html?url=3980&amp;client=ala1&amp;campaign=1245&amp;email=jrafferty@ocln.org) a new privacy website that contains tools that librarians can use to host educational sessions and public forums that help Americans understand their First and Fourth Amendment rights.

 

The website contains the following resources:

 

Guide for Moderators (PDF)

This document outlines the steps and process for moderators to convene a forum on privacy in their community. Libraries are a perfect location for this form of civic engagement. Librarians may choose to serve as moderators or find other individuals in the community to fill the moderator’s role. This PDF contains the information necessary for moderators of a forum on privacy.

 

Guide for Participants (PDF)

Distribute this document to individuals participating in a library-hosted community discussion on privacy. It provides an overview of the deliberative process and outlines the privacy issues to be considered.

 

Checklist for Convening a Forum on Privacy (PDF)

This document outlines the steps needed to host a successful forum on privacy in your library.

 

Choose Privacy Week Resources

This offers videos that can be used for programming on surveillance. The site includes guest blogs from national privacy advocates and American Library Association t-shirts and posters.

 

Please do not respond to this email. If you have any questions about the privacy toolkit, contact Jazzy Wright, press officer of the ALA Washington Office at jwright@alawash.org or (202) 628-8410

These Repeaters often display a lack of critical-thinking skills and often are very literal with their interpretations of assignments.

They will also often want significant ""hand-holding.""  For example: one specific patron will call in, tell us what is in his search box, and then ask ""is that a good search?""  Without trying the search for himself first.

Do you have any tips or strategies for dealing with this sort of repeat customer?  Are there any articles or resources out there you would recommend for some reading?

Currently our practice is to try to ""put it back on them.""  For example, with Mr. GoodSearch above, I might respond ""I don't know if that's a good search, did you try it?""  or ""The only way to know if it's a good search is to see if the information you retrieve is useful for answering your research question.""

Another example of ""putting it back on them"" comes up when we've sent follow-up emails after a phone call.  This will generally include some of the following:

* A short summary of the call (""You asked about..."")
* Highlights of search strategies used (""We tried..."")
* Placing the responsibility on them, (""Before calling back, try A,B,C,..."")
* Encouragement (""You are familiar with this topic..."" or ""You will become more comfortable with..."")",,False,,t5_2qidr,False,,,True,t3_1a3dc2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1a3dc2/repeaters/,

My question to you, fine Redditors, is what sort of information would make this a compelling educational experience for you? Please note that this is for the Public Library Association, and though I want to hear from you even if you don't work for a public library, keep in mind that's the framework I'm in.

If you're curious, I wouldn't be opposed to a co-presenter for this. I work as a public library manager and, at the ripe age of 26, am about 30 years younger than all of my peers.

I'm a new children's librarian and one of the big projects that my director eventually wants me to do is to un-Dewey the non-fiction section and put them into organization by categories like some other libraries have been doing.

This really baffles me.  Aren't they already organized by category?  Isn't that what Dewey's all about?  What is the difference between un-Deweying everything and moving stuff around and just putting up signs saying what the different number sections are?

I think my director thinks it's a lot more complicated for kids than it really is.  Has anyone here un-Deweyed their collection, and if so did you actually move everything or just change the call label and put up signs by subject?

I have my BS in business so I have interviewed with countless businesses and I interviewed for my LIS position right now.

Does anyone have tips, what I should expect.  Things that I should know?  I've been going through old assignments/notes and making sure I know certain things like MUSTIE, examples of all print reference materials like directories, yearbooks etc.  

The only thing that I think I am really lacking would be my knowledge on teen fiction.  I read teen literature but I have been so busy I've really stopped and if they say give me a read-a-like for this book I'm afraid I will blank.  Teen literature is so vast.  I can do reader's advisory for graphic novels no problem because that's what I used to read.

I was also an intern in the public relations department). I love knowledge and learning and the dissemination and organization of it. I think it would be a great career for me.

However, if I ever mention this to anyone, the response I invariably get is: ""aren't libraries like...dying?"" I know the institution of libraries as a whole is undergoing massive changes on every front; the way we approach information has changed completely from 50 years ago. But I believe people will always need information, need help understanding it and being directed to it. And we'll always need to be able to access information to put it together in new ways, to further understand it. I believe that libraries are not dying, just changing dramatically.

If I pursued a MLS degree, would I just be late to the party? Would I go another several thousand dollars in debt and spend 2 years in school to still not be able to find a fulfilling job?

I think I really want to do this, but I need a better understanding of the state of the field and the job market. I'm not sure how to get this, so I'm asking reddit!

A children's book entitled *Exploring Geology with Mr. Hibb: Discovering Evidence for the Creation and Biblical Flood* was donated recently and the patron requested that it be added to our collection (ISBN 978-1-921643-50-7).  At first glance, I think I will include it in our collection as we have a significant population that would use this resource.  However, the book does state as fact that the earth is 6000 years old (among other things).

Just looking for some discussion on whether or not you would add this title to your public library's collection.  And what Dewey number would this go under?  It's a geology book, but I almost want to put it with religion (J231.765).



EDIT:  I would like to thank everyone for your responses.

First, I would like to state that the donor of the book was told that we may or may not add it to the collection; they did ask for the book to be returned to them if it was not added to the collection.  I will be drafting a collection development policy as it turns out we don't really have one that helps in these situations.

Second, we have a large number of library families who are creationists and truly believe that the earth is 6000 years old.  Most of them are homeschooling families and we have had several requests for materials of this nature.

I have decided to add the book to our juvenile religion section.  As for my reasoning it is very much in line with the quote lcddc626 added from the ALA Freedom to Read Statement:

""It is in the public interest for publishers and librarians to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions, including those that are unorthodox, unpopular, or considered dangerous by the majority.""

Finally, we have a large Anabaptist population (we are right in Amish country) and their beliefs often intersect strongly with the creationist's beliefs. While these conservative patrons certainly think MANY of our books are unorthodox and dangerous (books containing homosexuality, witchcraft, evolution, etc.), I have not had a request to have ANY book removed from the shelves in the 5 years I have worked here.

My cousin Allison is a Peace Corps Volunteer in Rwanda, working with a 9 year, basic education, public school in the village of Kiruli. The school, G.S. Kiruli, is beginning a project that will vastly improve their library- but they need your help!


Two years ago she got the ball rolling on their in school library. Since then the library has blossomed and students are checking out books right and left. The problem is that the books are getting damaged by dust and rain. New shelves would help immensely, and they would like to commission 8 units (at around $200 each). Donation target is $2,000 by November 1st for this goal. Any extra money will be used for new books for the library.

The book is extensively water-damaged, with the hardcover warped and many of its pages stained, but the library says there are no notes in the item record to indicate such damage prior to my borrowing it. Since replacing the damn thing will likely run into the hundreds of dollars, is there anything you recommend I do to prove my innocence? Can a restorer tell when water damage occurred, for example, or could the library contact people who had previously borrowed the book to ask whether it was damaged when they borrowed it?

Thanks, all! As a jobless student, I'm already finding it difficult to afford ramen.

Wall of text.",22,3,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1htpl3/new_librarian_super_stressed_wall_of_text/,"*TLDR: What do experienced Librarians do to keep busy? I run out of stuff to do, I don't know what other tasks need to be tackled. How do you be a Librarian? How do you spend your day? What do you do?*

Hi /r/libraries. 

I've been hired as a part time Librarian and the experience has had plenty of ups and downs. I'm in a suburb for what it's worth.

Over the years while I was getting my education, I had been working in various libraries in various roles so I know how these places generally function. However, this is the first time I'm an actual true-blue professional Librarian (albeit part time). 

I know how to do reference and how to help patrons use the internet, print, etc, but I'm talking Meta-Librarianship. The big picture. What does it mean to be a Librarian? What do you do outside of Reference? 

My problem is that I have absolutely no idea. I can't exactly order books (Thanks to P.T.) but I can make lists of books to get. I've hosted a few programs and I have gone to some community festivals to 'help make ourselves known' as it were. I've made a few reading lists of book genres too.

So aside from Reference, and doing these things off and on, I just kind of sit around and try to look busy and avoid sites like Reddit or too many video gaming websites. I find in an average 5 hour part time day, I can stay busy doing the day to day for... maybe two hours. Then I'm left with the remaining three to just start going batshit crazy until I get to go home. 

I usually write long, eloquent emails to friends and family to look like I'm doing something. I'm writing a silly novella as well. I bring e-book PDFs to read. I read kirkus reviews for some inspiration. I used to be able to read School Library Journals until... May? Or so? Then they stopped appearing. I've tried making signs to help direct patrons but they all (they all!) go missing/apparently get thrown out. So that's a waste of time. I know how to stay busy for two hours. I don't know how to stay busy for five. It might sound like a 'dream job' to just lollygag but I go there to work and I'm just not sure what to do and I'm super paranoid that people ""know"" that I ""don't do anything."" I genuinely feel like I'm robbing them and I hate it. I've talked to my mother about it because she's a Librarian (and I don't want to talk to any of my coworkers) and she thinks I'm awful for not taking the initiative. ""Doing ANYTHING would be better than doing nothing!"" 

I guess I do and don't have an initiative problem. If I see that a fellow Librarian needs, say, a booklist off the internet, I bet they would be happy if I went and got a copy for them! Our evening program needs a bigger trashcan for wrappers: I'd better go get one! The ice seems to be melted in the soda can cooler. I should restock that! 

The other Librarians (Who have all been working professionally for over 20 years) all know what to do. I dont. ""Make a display."" Of what? How? I mean, sorry if I sound ridiculous or absurd, but I genuinely don't know. Ill put some posters up. I'll put some books on an A-Frame. I'll print out a sign to be taken down.

The situation I am in feels almost exactly as though I was a chef and I was in a pantry with shelves full of foods and ingredients. The Boss comes in and says: ""Okay! Now cook!"" 

Uh.. What would you like me to make Boss?

""Heck I dunno. Italian. Make Italian food."" and then the Boss leaves the room.

Well okay. Uh, well, um. Okay. I made pasta, lasagna, a salad, tiramisu, some meatballs, and some alfredo sauce. (I could go on but you get the idea.) And... I'm still stuck with 4 hours left in the day because I know how to cook that stuff and it just sort of comes together in this amount of time. 

I'm just extremely stressed because I learned theory in graduate school and that was about it. I have no idea how to be a Librarian outside of reference duties.

I've been a bit apprehensive about posting here after seeing some other posts from an ambitious and confused few who think ""starting a library"" sounds like a great way to kill time. This isn't why I'm here.

To keep it short: I'm with a resource-limited community. When you don't have much, everything you have is a point of pride. Naturally, they don't have a library. When I asked my close friend, a leader in the community, what would happen if we could change that, he told me, ""If you build it, I will get them to read."" However ideal, that was sufficient: it's being done.

One month in, and so far:

- We have a space, a large room, fit for a few thousand books.
- We have wood to build shelves extra shelves. One wall is already complete and full (native language texts, English to come on the other)
- We have some catalog software (will return with specifics)
- We have set the donations in order to keep the book flow coming.
- We have a reading awareness campaign in the works.
- We have plans for weekly events, reading clubs, discussions, and more.

What I don't have is any clue how I'm going to keep this room of soon-to-be organized books -- rightly, a library -- functioning in the long run. I can't maintain it forever. It could be managed by one employee, but unfortunately, for a refugee community, there isn't enough auxiliary cash flowing around to pay even $150/American a month to find a librarian. I don't know how libraries work with minimal resources. From my perfunctory reading, they require an incredible amount of maintenance.

That will come. I'll find a way to fund it myself if I have to. The shelves will be full. The idle ones who are interested will have books to read and some structure to develop as readers. I can promise that much. 

But anything worth building should be left with room to grow, and I can't picture it. I fear that maybe I'm making a mistake in the early steps which will cap any potential progress for the library later on. The one-room limitation, for instance. I'm not so naive to think I've got this. For sure, I've left things out, considerations that need to be weighed, variables, hidden costs, library cards, late fines, et al infinitum. All advances we've made on this project have been fueled by a sort of mindless, baseline logical energy. Now, I realize that pragmatics will crop up, threaten to destroy the few small strides we've taken.

I come to you as an occasional lurker here, and someone who has loved and learned and appreciated the often underscored physical life of libraries themselves. I come to you as a book lover and as this person who has the chance to give another -- even just one person in this crippled place -- a place to find part of themselves. 


Yes, I'm scared. There. Now, what should I be doing?

I am trying to figure out what direction to go career-wise. I bounced around a bit as an undergrad (money issues) but finally graduated with an overall 3.3 in Biology. I went to a (very good) school for a graduate program in the sciences, and was extremely unhappy (with the environment, in particular). So now I'm re-evaluating what I want out of my career and life. I had some questions for those who hold an MLIS and work either as a librarian or in another position related to what you studied.

1. How did you decide on library sciences? What drew you to it? Did you do a specialization? Has that helped you career-wise?

2. What experience did you have prior to applying for graduate school? Anything I could do work- or volunteer-wise to make sure I'm not choosing the wrong thing?

3. Did you have any trouble getting a job in your desired field once you completed the MLIS? Has it been worth it to you?

Thanks for any advice you can give me. I appreciate any feedback!

EDIT: I just want to say thank you so much to everyone who replied. Your feedback was immensely helpful. I feel like I have a more realistic picture of what it will be like, but I think that the nature of the work (despite the tedium, complicated job prospects, and probably occasionally pissy patrons/professors) suits me and my skill set. The city I'm moving to at the end of March has two open librarian assistant positions at the university there. I'm going to apply for those and hope like hell I get a chance.

I am currently a freshman taking general courses at a local community college, what steps would I need to take to pursue a career as a librarian? 

I already planned on transferring to a state college after completing my generals and would talk to counselors during that process as well, but the one question I have concerns appearance. 

I am fairly to heavily tattooed by most people standards (hands, neck, chest, etc.) , I would have no problem dressing conservatively or even using heavy stage makeup to disguise my tattoos during working hours. 

My question is, Is being tattooed going to cause huge issues as far as finding a job if I would choose to pursue this field of study? Do the standards of employers vary from place to place? Will my potential grades and degrees and level of dedication be enough to help people overlook my physical appearance?

I'm looking to start a career in librarianship (specifically in a medical or health library)... but I'm not sure how to start. I already have my MLIS which I got last year. I had no library experience beforehand, just a bout of depression in which my therapist urged me to take an aptitude test and start figuring out my life from there. The top result on my test was (surprise) librarian, and that's how I went about applying for, and getting, my MLIS. 

I've worked in customer service for over 8 years and would really like to work with the public. I've been out of work for a year and I'm not sure how to even start going about getting into the librarian field. 


I've applied to hundreds of jobs over the past year but I've only had 2 interviews (but no job offers), and one internship (in computer science - which was not my thing). I suspect my lack of experience is to blame. I've applied to volunteer to several libraries but never received any feedback (probably because I'm overqualified, or they don't need any help). 

I know this is a competitive field, so I'm wondering if any librarians have any advice for me? Thank you.",,False,,t5_2qidr,False,,,True,t3_1jtrmx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1jtrmx/how_can_i_go_about_becoming_a_librarian/,

So, here I am... No experience in traditional cataloging, and I'm about to graduate.

I have to get a good grade in the class. My GPA is in scary B territory. I have fairly severe lupus, and my health has affected my grades much more than I'd have liked.

I've recently joined the staff of a public school here in South Africa as a teacher-librarian (Grades 1 - 7). I'm filled with enthusastic (probably over-optimistic) ideas about how to improve our library, but there is one stumbling block: we are still operating entirely using a card catalog system. There is not one barcode to be seen in the place.

I only have an hour every two weeks with each class. Most of that time is spent on returning and taking-out books using the manual card system. I would love to free up my time so that I can promote information literacy, do storytelling with the little ones, and so on. Please assume that administration are already aware that we 'should' invest in a barcode system but for now, as a new librarian, I'm not in a position to push for that expense. I hope to convince them of the necessity of the upgrade soon. I do not have a library assistant, student assistants (yet), or a computer with internet - I do have my tiny netbook. 

I'm reaching out to /r/Libraries with the hope that I can gain some insight into running a manual library system. How did things 'used' to go before we had barcode scanners? Any tips on managing a lovely little library which is a bit behind the times? Want to give any kind of essential advice to a new librarian?

I love your work. Have you lost weight? Anyway, I'm always on the lookout for library page/shelve/circulation's back room jobs where I currently live. This may sound silly, but all I want to do is shelve books. I'm good at it, it makes me happy, and I'll be darned if I wouldn't show up to this job early every day. ~~You may be thinking I've romanced this job to all hell, but (and people don't believe me when I tell them this) I've been doing this my whole life thanks to a book hoarder tendency that started in infancy. (Just kidding. No I'm not.)~~ Call me a little delusional, but I would jump at the chance to do this for minimum wage.

However, in the past 6 months, I've had two interviews of about 7-10 positions I've applied for. I get robot email replies telling me they've found someone who ""better fits our qualifications"" which I get after an interview, or ""will better meet all of our immediate requirements"" which I get a month after applying and not getting an interview.

Clearly, I'm doing something wrong. I admit I'm a little strange and nerdy in interiews. I can fix that. What's wrong with my application process, though? Should I call the day after applying online? *Who* am I going to call? Because apparently the Ghostbusters don't work there anymore.

**Here are some things about me:**

* retail experience

* library volunteer experience

* a volunteer experience at an event that required organizing books

* I did pretty well on a cataloging test; or is perfect the only option?

* My schedule is completely free

* I like helping people find books and other materials, then sending them home with armsfull of media.

**Some potential problems:**

* I have a bachelor's in something not library related. Should I remove my education information from my resume? Is *this* what's messing up my qualifications?

* Have I been blackballed in the whole system after an interview with one branch that went well but apparently wasn't good enough to get me hired? Because I haven't gotten an interview since that went down.

* Should I *not* continue to list my 100 WPM and my ability to use Ubuntu?

* In the desired wage portion of the application, I put $8/hr because the job description usually lists $8+. Is lowballing holding me back? Should I enter the exact wage they say they pay, even if it's $8.75?

People I see in this position at most libraries seem to be students or middle-aged women. Do I need to be on financial aid or food stamps or unemployment for someone to take my job hunt seriously?

I live in a metropolitan that has new branches popping up about once per year, so there's got to be something open, right? Also, it seems like libraries that are a 1-2 hour drive away are hiring more often than this city is in a month, so I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to branch out (ha. ha.) into more rural towns.

Took a position out of state, but want to move back home... would contacting library directors to inquire about positions be poor etiquette?",18,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1a8ii8/ive_been_an_academic_librarian_for_3_years_took_a/,"I hate this! I am currently happily employed at an large academic library  (R1 type institution), but I want to move back home-ish. 


The problem is, in order to apply for positions I have to get letters of reference from my current colleagues. Now remember, I'm happy here and they are also happy with me! I don't want to ruin that relationship prematurely. They basically carved out a position for me, and I LOVE my colleagues and overall feel like I would be leaving them high and dry. I have started a big program and it will fall apart if I leave. I feel like if I tell them I am looking around word will spread that I'm unhappy or ungrateful (or worse, other unfounded ideas e.g. rumors that I won't make tenure). So first off I am looking for advice on this catch-22 situation. How did you deal with it? Some positions require references up front, some you can supply later on in the process.


Secondly, having worked in Academia I know that sometimes exceptions are made. Do you think it would look really bad if I emailed the Library Directors of the 4-5 schools I'm interested in to see if they have any plans for future positions that I might apply for? I don't want to toot my own horn too much but I am a strong candidate for positions in my niche, but unfortunately my niche is pretty specific, too (a growing niche, not a old-guard niche).


I got this idea because recently our library director found some extra money in the budget for a new position and we decided to make some pretty odd exceptions to get strong candidate that made a good impression on the director in the past. It was one of those, ""we heard you might be interested... and we just happen to have this new position open... and look you also fit the requirements...."". We conducted a normal search, but the candidate was a shoe-in.


Anyway, I digress. Thanks for listening to my venting and please let me know if you have any thoughts for me :)

As one of the tech librarians, I sometimes have patrons schedule one-hour long individual sessions for computer training.

While I appreciate her enthusiasm, the more I work with her, the more I realize that she has trouble understanding boundaries. On more than one occasion, she has asked to meet outside of the library for additional training, asked to get coffee with me to discuss computers, and assumed I would come into work on my day off to teach her. Obviously, I have shot down these requests as politely as I can.

My primary issue is trying to figure out how to get her to understand that she is one of hundreds of customers I need to help, and that I can't spend 10 to 20 percent of my work week working individually with her.

White House Petition is pending 25000 signatures by Feb 4th.,20,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/ol0mn/help_us_ensure_that_every_child_in_america_has/,"25,000 Signatures needed by Feb 4th 2012.

Every child in America deserves access to an effective school library program. We ask that the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) provide dedicated funding to help support effective school library programs. Such action will ensure more students have access to the resources and tools that constitute a 21st century learning environment. Reductions in school library programs are creating an ‘access gap’ between schools in wealthier communities versus those where there are high levels of poverty. All students should have an equal opportunity to acquire the skills necessary to learn, to participate, and to compete in today’s world.

The University of North Carolina at Greensboro was recently awarded a 3rd ACE (Academic and Cultural Enrichment) Scholars grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program.

As part of this grant, UNC-G needs to recruit 10 students from under-represented communities into their ALA-accredited two-year Master of Library and Information Studies (MLIS) degree program and prepare them for professional positions in community college libraries, with emphasis on serving diverse populations, including refugees and immigrants.  

The program can be completed online or face-to-face on the campus in Greensboro, NC. The program requires a full semester practicum in a community college and service learning projects, as well as specialized course work in community college librarianship. As fellow NCLA members, we are hoping that you might be able to identify staff members, former students, or interested others to join the program.

The ACE Scholars will receive:

·       full tuition and fees, and a monthly stipend to attend the UNCG LIS program

·       memberships to ALA and NCLA or other state organization

·       community college practicum opportunities

·       networking and mentoring opportunities from community college librarians 

The time for application is short, you must have a completed application to the graduate school by August 1, 2013. The program will start in mid-August. The program is fast-tracked. It must be completed in 2 years.

To apply: 

1) To apply for admission to the graduate school. For this they will need:

·        Recent (within 5 years) GRE scores

·       Transcripts from either a US institution or have transcripts from a non-US institution evaluated by a NACES accredited organization.

·       A validation of proficiency in English if it is not your native language and if you have international transcripts.

2) To apply for the ACE Scholars Program for Community College Librarianship scholarship. Please submit:

The application
A personal statement that explains your interest in community college libraries
The statement can be a written document or a video presentation
Discuss in up to 500 words why you are interested in participating in the current ACE Scholars Program and
Discuss in up to 500 words what value your diversity background/experiences will add to community college libraries serving diverse communities, such as New Americans

3) Participate in an interview with the grant’s principal investigators in person or through some other medium.

I've been working at a college library as a Special Collections Assistant for the past year, and I've been considering a career path in archives or special collections for awhile. I'm a rising junior with a double major in Anthropology and Art History, and I have a background in archaeology. Other than my current job working at an art library, my work experience is mostly geared toward experience in archaeology. What should I be doing while I'm still in undergrad to follow this career path? I'm unsure of what universities look for in students applying for library science masters programs and the like... is my current job enough? What kind of internships should I be doing otherwise? I'd really appreciate any advice or input. Thanks!

Bad customer service or unreasonable expectation that fees should be waived?,18,3,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1hkwdg/exasperation_over_1_bad_customer_service_or/,"Food for thought: Why do people think they don't have to pay for things? Especially at libraries? 

A lady came in today. She had lost her library card and our charge to replace the lost card is $1. I said ""Ok, it will cost $1."" She says ""I don't have a dollar."" and looks at me expectantly. I say ""Okay."" and she stares at me, and I look back at her. And there is silence for a moment, and then she sighs exasperatedly and says to her kids ""Come on, I'm NOT paying a dollar."" and storms out. 

Ignoring the fact that I don't believe anyone goes out in the world without a SINGLE DOLLAR on them (we take cash, check and credit card!), what is she expecting me to do in this situation? Waive the fee? Say the price is made up? That we only charge unless you can't pay, in which case everything's free? It seems like somehow I'm giving bad customer service, like I'm supposed to apologize for enforcing policy, and yet it's so frustrating that people think the costs associated with service don't apply to them, especially when related to libraries. Does this work with any other service? Do you go to McDonald's and say ""I want a hamburger."" and they say ""It's $1."" And you say ""I don't have $1."" And they say ""Oh, never mind then, here's your free burger.""?

I get the idea that there should be room for flexibility and mercy, that if someone really is having a difficult time and you want to help them out, there is some wiggle room to cut someone some slack. I do understand that, and have definitely made exceptions for charity in the past. But there is also a conversation that happens before, where they express their hardship and desire for an exception to be made, and I consider the situation and decide what is reasonable, and usually that's for people who really are in a bind. People who have somehow managed to rack up a large amount of fees and will probably never be able to pay them off, or ever come back to the library because of the fees against them. In those cases, options like volunteering to work off fees can be negotiated to keep it fair and reasonable. I just don't really consider $1 for a lost card to fall into the 'charity' category.

I suppose you can argue that the policy to charge $1 to replace a lost card is frivolous, but I didn't set the policy, and that's not really the issue. I get the same conversation from people with late fees, or registration fees, or out of city fees. There is an expectation that because Libraries provide a low-cost information sharing service to the public, somehow everyone's entitled to free everything. Never mind that libraries are paid for by taxpayers so they're not really 'free', and that when entrusted with taxpayer money, the best thing I can do is be a good steward of it and only give away for free that which is actually supposed to be covered by those funds.

I hear a lot of talk from older generations about how 'entitled' this generation is. How entitled millennials are for expecting things like debt-free educations and jobs with a livable wage. But let me tell you, the individuals who give me grief over having to pay for the service they receive are not millennials. If anything, I see more frequently in older generations this mentality that you should only pay if you can't argue/barter/coerce your way out of it. Where anyone who pays full price is a fool for not pulling all the social strings they know to cut themselves a better deal... Everything is about 'beating the system' and I get this attitude the least from the youngest among us. 

So that was my frustration for today. That somehow I provided bad customer service by not leaping to waive her $1 charge. What do you think?",,False,,t5_2qidr,False,,,True,t3_1hkwdg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1hkwdg/exasperation_over_1_bad_customer_service_or/,

I'm currently working as a reference librarian, but only as part-time. I recently found out that my position was created (along with 2 others) via turning two full-time positions into part-time. Rumor in my office is that eventually, aside from director and branch manager, all the positions will become part-time.

Is this a trend throughout the USA? Or is my area the only one? I was hoping my position would become full-time, but I was told (not by my boss, but someone in a high position) that it might not be possible.

- For reference, aha a joke!, I work in Kentucky. I wanted to get another job at another library and have 2 library part-time jobs, but according to one of the HR people if I work at both one of them will still have to provide me with benefits... now I've picked up a part-time at Target.

The patron called for help with technical problems, but was already agitated before calling.  The patron yelled, refused to follow my directions, and would not answer my questions.

I feel good about the call because I:

* Remained calm and did not escalate my mood to match the patron's.
* Asked clarifying questions to understand the patron's difficulty.
* Explained why I was asking the patron to take certain steps
* Explained calmly that I would have to end the call unless the patron calmed down and stopped yelling.
* Ended the call when the patron continued yelling.

What are some tips, tricks, strategies, etc. that you use when dealing with escalated/angry patrons?

[Database of Award-Winning Children's Literature](http://www.dawcl.com) is wonderful when someone needs a book that won such-and-such an award. When it's a kid I can narrow it down by age level and genre to try and find something they'd like.

[Fantastic Fiction](http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk). There's always a patron who wants the next book in a series but can't remember the title. This site allows you to search by title and author. On the author's page you can view all the series and the order they go in as well as recommendations by the author.

[Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com) I use this site to keep track of what I've read and what I thought of it. There's listopia where users can vote for their favorite children's book of all time or most anticipated 2013 release. I've added a few of my regular patrons as friends on here to keep up with what they're reading and to share with them my latest book.

[AR BookFinder](http://www.arbookfind.com) I cannot stand AR. I always get the procrastinating kid looking for a lower grade level book that will net them 15 points and they need to read it by tomorrow. (Ok, that's an exaggeration. But not much.) I find this site useful for reasons other than AR though. I sometimes get a parent looking for a good mystery on a 9th grade reading level and I'll blank out on suggestions. I use AR BookFinder's advanced search and set in the BL 9.0 to 9.9, hit a subject, and see what comes up. 

So those are a few of my favorites. What sites do you find make your job easier?

Unfortunately, my husband's job has been transferred and my family will be moving far away so I'm having to leave my job, which I adore, and go on the hunt.

I've managed to snag an interview for a Library Associate position in our new town, which is also a part of a county system, and much larger than the one I'm coming from.  I'm fairly certain they are interviewing about 15 people for the position.

While I've been working as a capital L Librarian these last few years, I'm still 4 classes shy of my MLS, hence the library associate title (which requires a 4 year degree).  According to the job description, the only difference in this job and a position as a Librarian is the lack of the MLS; all of the job duties are the same.

So all that said, how do I make myself stand out?  I'm on a relatively level playing field, education wise.  I'm not sure if my almost completed MLS will work for or against me (nice little pay jump going from library associate to Librarian) and I expect to complete my degree by this time next year.  I'm probably up against people with library experience.  I have enthusiasm running out of my ears and I'm a little scared it will scare them off!

I enjoy dealing with the public, but I when interactions turn sour or I feel as though I did not do my best to meet the patron's needs, I tend to dwell on those certain instances and worry about making the library look bad to the patron.

For example, today a patron came in to return DVDs and brought one DVD up to the desk. She said she wanted to return it, pay the late fees, and, if nobody else had it on request, check it out again. At this point I had checked the item in to our system and told her the fine was $0.40, and I then explained that it is our policy to try and avoid checking things in and back out to the same patron to give others a chance to check out the items. She said she didn't get the chance to view the DVD and really wanted to see it. I offered to re-case the item and put it on the re-shelving cart for her to pick out and bring back up, or place a hold on the item for her. She said ""no"" and left, seeming very agitated. I realized later that she meant to just renew the item, and I probably could have just let her check it back out again.

I know this is by no means a really ""rough"" interaction; luckily I personally haven't had any really rude/mean patrons come my way, though there was an instance on Monday with my coworkers in the earlier shift. However, little things like this get under my skin and I've spent the rest of this afternoon worrying about what her opinion of the library must be now.

I recently started an online MLIS program.  I really enjoy it--I imagine most people who want to be librarians enjoy school!--and it's multiplied my desire to get a job in the field of information science.
However, the deadline to either withdraw or pay is approaching (tomorrow night, in fact), and I'm increasingly feeling like I'm paying for improved job prospects rather than an education.  The things I'm learning seem like things I could pursue on my own time with little outlay, and that I would learn more actually working in the field if, somehow, I could get involved in it without this degree.

Plus, after nosing through this subreddit, it seems that my job hunt will still be quite difficult after paying through the nose for the right to slap an extra qualification on my resume.

So: how possible is it to get started in this field without an MLIS?  Can I take on volunteer work or internships to bolster my chances?  Does working as a library page or similar low-skill job help?  I've joined ASIS&amp;T and SAA; can I stay involved and hopefully make contacts without being in school or having a library job?

Also, have you found that your MLIS was a valuable source of on-the-job knowledge?  Is there stuff I just haven't gotten into yet in my first semester that I'll really find indispensable later on?

A dream job for me would be in a special collections area of a museum, just FYI, but I'd happily work in other areas related to info science, including UI/UX and info systems.

Thanks in advance for any knowledge or advice you can throw at me!",,False,,t5_2qidr,False,,,True,t3_12ofzi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/12ofzi/how_possible_is_it_to_get_a_library_job_sans_an/,

I graduated in May with my MLIS and I am now working at four different libraries because I can't find just one full time job.  I am big on networking and meeting people so when something does come up I may have a connection.

I'm starting to run into problems with too much work though.  I think I am fairly well known in the area as a recent grad and someone who has big aspirations and knows what they are doing.

I am working as a teen librarian @ 20 hours.  Adult librarian @20 hours.  Youth librarian @ 8 hours and I just got hired today at another library as a sub.  I accepted the job that I got today because it is an amazing library that I have been wanting to work at for a while.  I am working about 50 hours a week which is amazing and I love what I do!  The adult librarian position also won't stay at 20 hours.

My big questions is where do I go from here?  There are no full time positions at any of these four places and I think just doing my job well isn't enough to set me apart from my competition.  How do you set yourself apart from the competition?  I already don't have a traditional librarian background I have my BS in Management and Minor in Marketing which I made that decision when I knew I wanted to be a librarian I thought it would give me a leg up on my competition. 

I think maybe getting involved on a regional and national level might be my next move.  I am already a member of ALA and MLA (Michigan).  

What do you all recommend?  Although I just graduated in May I want to take my career to the next level I'm just not sure how to do it. ",,False,,t5_2qidr,False,,,True,t3_zqvpu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/zqvpu/im_working_at_4_different_libraries_and_have/,

Is this how things are everywhere?,14,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1fxom1/got_a_shock_now_disillusioned_with_my_library_due/,"About a week ago I finished up a nearly-two year gig as a student library assistant. It was at an academic/science-oriented library, and I worked there through most of my time in library school. It was hands-down a fantastic experience all around, and I felt surrounded by these amazing librarians and staff members whom I genuinely admired and hoped to be like one day. I got the job after a really rough few years of miserable retail work and then a long unemployment, and I felt so fortunate to have landed a spot in such a supportive atmosphere, surrounded by great people. I only left because I landed a pretty great practicum on the other side of the country; I'd have stayed forever if they'd let me. 

At least, that was all true until this week, the first since I left. This is all coincidental -- nothing to do with me directly -- but in the week since, some huge drama has gone down which I've heard about through friends and associates still in the library, and frankly, I'm fucking shocked. 

It turns out that there's deep unhappiness in that library. The reference librarians are in intense competition, harboring resentments and getting pretty cutthroat with each other. One of the director-level managers is apparently broadly despised, which... I mean, shit, a week ago I'd have said she was one of the people I admired most in that library. Unfortunately, she had major beef with the *other* person I admired most in the library, and just forced her rival out, not but a few months shy of her planned retirement. They even tried to force her out without her retirement benefits, accrued over decades of work in that same library... that's some cold fucking shit right there. (She managed to get them back, but not without a battle.)

So it turns out that all this time, everyone has been unhappy and scared, fighting with each other, angry at each other, and either trying to figure out how to get out or fearing that they'd be pushed out. 

I mean, maybe we weren't really all friends, but I thought we were at least all *friendly*. I thought that was a place that would at least treat its staff and librarians decently even when things weren't going well. 

I don't know what to think anymore. I suppose I'm grateful that, as a student librarian, I was shielded from all this... like I said, it was never anything to do with me, and even now I think that I was well-liked. Certainly I genuinely liked most everyone there. But now I just don't know anymore. It turns out the place I spent the last two years was nothing at all like the place I thought it was, so who knows what else I'm wrong about?

Have you been through something like this? Is this a common thing? Are there red flags that you look for to tell whether a workplace suffers from toxic office politics? 

I'm feeling so fucking disillusioned. This sucks.

Late update: Just to wanted to say thanks to all of you for the kind words and advice. It's funny, I'm no lamb in the woods, and I've certainly worked in some awful places before, but this one really took me by surprise. I think it worried me especially because I *just* (as in day before yesterday) moved across country to start looking for a job in a new city (can't be any worse than any of the other strategies I've seen employed), and I'm pretty unnerved by how oblivious I apparently was.

The library I work at runs this program once a month called Library After Dark. It's on Friday evenings after the library shuts down. They hold the program in the café area and sell wine, beer, snacks, etc. There are themes to each program and the most recent was Downton Abbey. There was Downton Abbey trivia with Downton-themed prizes, a photo booth with props, word games, an online test you could take to see which character you would be, etc.

There was a good turnout (mostly a much older demographic) and the program got great feedback.

The library is thinking of making one of the upcoming months a Game of Thrones theme. While the last program had good feedback, there was a lot of downtime and people were still sort of reserved, mostly just sitting around the café tables and not too much mingling, etc. (which is what we want people to be doing at these events)
Any ideas on activities or ways to get people more excited/make the program feel more lively? Or to draw in more people from other age groups? Or any specific Game of Thrones ideas to incorporate in this program? We'll be doing the photo booth/props again since that was a huge hit last time.

I'm considering packing up and just moving out to either Madison or Urbana, but before doing so, it'd be great to get some second opinions on why it might or might not be a smart move. My biggest concern, of course, is moving there only to be denied admission. I've heard that getting into MLIS programs isn't typically too difficult, but taking a blind leap like this is still pretty scary. Have many of you been rejected despite having a decent academic record?

Lastly, would being male and a minority work in my benefit when it comes to admissions?

**The eBook User’s Bill of Rights**

Every eBook user should have the following rights:

* the right to use eBooks under guidelines that favor access over proprietary limitations
* the right to access eBooks on any technological platform, including the hardware and software the user chooses
* the right to annotate, quote passages, print, and share eBook content within the spirit of fair use and copyright
* the right of the first-sale doctrine extended to digital content, allowing the eBook owner the right to retain, archive, share, and re-sell purchased eBooks

I believe in the free market of information and ideas.

I believe that authors, writers, and publishers can flourish when their works are readily available on the widest range of media. I believe that authors, writers, and publishers can thrive when readers are given the maximum amount of freedom to access, annotate, and share with other readers, helping this content find new audiences and markets. I believe that eBook purchasers should enjoy the rights of the first-sale doctrine because eBooks are part of the greater cultural cornerstone of literacy, education, and information access.

Digital Rights Management (DRM), like a tariff, acts as a mechanism to inhibit this free exchange of ideas, literature, and information. Likewise, the current licensing arrangements mean that readers never possess ultimate control over their own personal reading material. These are not acceptable conditions for eBooks.

I am a reader. As a customer, I am entitled to be treated with respect and not as a potential criminal. As a consumer, I am entitled to make my own decisions about the eBooks that I buy or borrow.

I am concerned about the future of access to literature and information in eBooks.  I ask readers, authors, publishers, retailers, librarians, software developers, and device manufacturers to support these eBook users’ rights. 

These rights are yours.  Now it is your turn to take a stand.  To help spread the word, copy this entire post, add your own comments, remix it, and distribute it to others.  Blog it, Tweet it (#ebookrights), Facebook it, email it, and post it on a telephone pole.

A friend of mine who just graduated from library school and lives in a small college was offered a job as a director of a public library of an even smaller town. 

In the job offer it basically laid out the details as a librarian should do, but they didn't tell the salary until she went in for the interview. It was $9 an hour for a 40 hour a week job. It would either be barely enough for her to pay rent and survive, but coming out of grad school she is in some debt and it would not be enough for her to do anything, but survive.

The only two people on staff with the MLIS are myself and the director, who is Chinese. I'm not sure if she got her degree from an American or Chinese institution (I know she attended college in Beijing, just not sure about the master's degree), but she's been the director there for over a decade. 

I love the job. But there's one thing about the library's procedures that positively drives me up the wall and I can't decide whether I should bring it up or not. 

Like most academic institutions, we use the LCSH call number system. BUT, we don't shelve books according to LCSH standards. If two otherwise identical call numbers end in .S3879 and .S39, they're going to be miles apart on the shelves, and the latter will come first. Because 39 is a significantly smaller number than 3879. In short, they (*sigh* we...) treat that last set of digits as whole numbers instead of as decimal points. 

Because of the way LCSH works, I think we're doing a disservice to our patrons by eliminating the possibility for easy serendipitous discovery by putting books that are really really close in subject matter really really far from each other. 

In addition, the school's nursing program is up for reaccreditation this year, and part of the accreditation review will involve nursing education gurus inspecting that section of the library, including searching for books at random and seeing if they're on the shelves. If these people know anything about LCSH and how the books should be arranged, that could be bad. 

Do I say something? Would that be overstepping my bounds, or would it be constructive input? Re-organizing the entire collection would be a pretty massive undertaking, as would re-training all the staff who have been doing it this way for years and years. If I do say something, how do I approach it? 


**tldr**: My library does Library of Congress Classification wrong, and I don't know whether I should approach the non-native-English-speaking Director about it or not.

I'm in college now and I should have about a year left of school. 
I'm hoping to join a Masters' in Library Science program after I graduate and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice?
 So far, the program I am looking at is all online. I'm hoping I will be able to find a library job while I take those courses.
I've worked the last 3 years (maybe 3 1/2 and still there) at my university's library in hopes that that will improve my chances at being a librarian (and also because working there makes me happy and it's my life ^.^).
I heard that since everything is leaning towards digital that I should look into a degree that deals with the digital material or into archives. Originally, I had been planning on going into the ""public Librarianship"" degree. 
Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

Edit: So thank you everyone! I've been using some of the online classes and I have already learned some really interesting things about computer and html!",,False,,t5_2qidr,1372918891.0,,,True,t3_1h8hn6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1h8hn6/wannabe_librarian_advice/,
