If you'd like to change your CSS (make a black background - or hell, just make most everything black), that'd be preferable to making the subreddit entirely private. This way, most users will get the message, but can still carry on with their day on your subreddit (after temporarily disabling CSS).

Here's some easy-to-follow directions on how to change your CSS if you are interested in blacking out. **PLEASE NOTE** that I am only providing this as an alternative for people who would be setting their subreddits to private. I'm not encouraging or discouraging anyone to blackout their subs, though. That's entirely up to the moderators' discretion. Super huge thanks to kjoneslol for helping with this CSS.

**Once again, you are not required or even encouraged to black out your subreddit.** (But changing the CSS is more preferable than just setting things to private.)

** *REMEMBER TO MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR CURRENT SUBREDDIT SETTINGS, AND YOUR HEADER LOGO!!!* **

**Step 1:** [Save this image](http://i.imgur.com/0DmX519.png) and upload it as your subreddit's logo/masthead. *REMEMBER TO MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR CURRENT HEADER LOGO!!*

**Step 2:** [Save this image](http://i.imgur.com/YZCUaa6.png) and name it sprite-reddit.png, then upload it on the stylesheet page of your subreddit.

**Step 3:** [Go here and copy this CSS](http://pastebin.com/aevqpQHF). Then paste it in your subreddit's stylesheet box. *PLEASE REMEMBER TO MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR CURRENT STYLESHEET!!!* 

**Step 4:** Copy and paste the following in your sidebar: 

    ###### [**Why is this subreddit blacked out?** Click here to learn more about CISPA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stand/comments/1cufnx/official_unofficial_cispa_discussion_thread/)

**CSS EDITED AT 5:23AM EST** Please update your CSS if it's older than this.


**EDIT 2!** Here's a ""black out LITE"" version of the CSS if you don't want everything to be completely black.

1320786572.0,71,self.modhelp,m58qm,User flair tutorial: 7 easy steps to enable user-choosable flair on your subreddit with as many images as your heart desires,83,12,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/m58qm/user_flair_tutorial_7_easy_steps_to_enable/,"I spent a good amount of time recently trying to get a clean, easy, and robust flair implementation for my subreddits and I'd like to share with you my solution. I found a couple tutorials around but they were not complete solutions, and often required a lot of busy-work, and none of them covered sprite sheets. The following method will prep your sprite sheet for you, and automatically process the coordinate output into css which you can simply drop into your sub and go. *Once you know what you are doing, the whole process takes less than 5 minutes for an infinite number of items of flair.*

Check out implementations on [r/jrpg](http://www.reddit.com/r/jrpg) and [r/beer](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer) to get an idea of what the end product will look like. 

**1. Find some images**

Any sizes will work, but you should aim to keep them at least relatively small. Drop them all in a folder and give them simple names with no punctuation. PNGs are recommended for all items. 

**NEW! Multiple steps combined into one!**

**2-4. Prep the sprite sheet and CSS**

Add all your images to a single zip. Go [here](http://spritegen.website-performance.org/). Change ""Class Prefix (optional):"" from ""sprite-"" to ""flair-"". Upload your zip and press go. Save the image output as spritesheet.png. Copy the CSS into a file, name doesn't matter.

**5. Add a few more CSS selectors**

Copy and paste the following at the top of your CSS file (above all the stuff we just pasted in there):

	.flairselector .customizer {
	display: none !important;
	}
	
	.flair {
	border: none !important;
	top:20px;
	padding:0px;
	background: url(%%spritesheet%%);
	display:inline-block;
	}
	
Branching path! If you are using large flair and want it to appear docked to the left a-la [r/jrpg](http://www.reddit.com/r/jrpg), add in this additional block. If you want standard flair next to the user name, you can skip this.

	 .link .flair, .entry .tagline .flair {
	float:left;
	}
	
To Reddit!

**6. Upload to Reddit**

Go to your sub. Choose ""community settings"". Choose ""edit the stylesheet"" near the bottom.

First upload the sprite sheet. Click the browse button midway down the page, and find your spritesheet.png. Choose that. Make sure ""new image name"" is set to spritesheet. Upload.

Now add the css. There will probably already be stuff in the big text box at the top of the page. If there is not, don't worry. Scroll to the end, and paste the entire contents of your flair.css file at the end of this box. Click Save. With any luck, ""saved"" will appear in red and you'll be onto the final step. If not, you screwed one of the above steps up, but feel free to post questions here.

Final step!

**7. Enable flair**

Click ""edit user flair"" in your Admin Box. Check the two boxes under ""flair options"". Choose left or right as you see fit (if you chose the branching path, you'll want to keep this on left). 

Click the ""edit flair templates"" tab. Enter the image name (without the .png) in the far right box (css class column) and click save. *If everything has been done correctly, a new line will pop up, and you'll see the individual flair image on the previous line* [looking something like this](http://i.imgur.com/QT37O.png). That's it! All you have to do is add all your flair items to these lines and the job is complete. 

**8. Final tips**

If you want to add more flair in the future, you'll need to repeat steps 2 through 6, so make sure you keep all of your individual images saved. It is actually a very quick process once you know what you are doing; I can get more images added to my subs in less than five minutes. You'll also need to add the item to the flair templates from step 7. 

Hopefully this helps some people!

*Shadowban* - A site-wide ban on a user that the user is not notified of. This is usually the result of breaking reddit's rules. The user is unaware of the ban because their posts will still show up for them, but nobody else will see the user's activity.    
*Distinguish* - A mod has the ability to Distinguish a post, this marks a submission or comment with a green [ M ]/changes the username to green, and indicates that it has been posted in the official capacity as a moderator.

### Good moderation practices 
---
**Review reported links, removing or ignoring as needed**    
On a periodic basis, you should review the reported links. Always be sure to leave a distinguished comment when banning a post.

Sometimes, it’s easy to tell why a link was reported: the link may be broken, the post may be completely off-topic for your subreddit, or it might break whatever special rules you have for your subreddit.If you can’t tell, then just ignore the report.If you’re a junior moderator, and you think it might be questionable, or you’re just unsure, then don’t click ‘ignore’ and discuss it with the other moderators.

**Review the spam listing**    
The procedure here is the same as for reports. Review the posts and comments stuck in the spamfilter and take appropriate action. 

**Monitor submissions and comment threads, removing posts when appropriate**    
A useful tool to do this is by using the links listed at the top of this post. Remember to leave a distinguished comment where needed.

**Ban users when necessary**    
This is the most extreme sanction a moderator has available for dealing with troublesome users.If a user has had their posts repeatedly banned, and if they’ve shown no inclination to follow the rules of the subreddit, then you can ban them completely from the subreddit. If you are a junior moderator, you will probably want to discuss this with other moderators before banning a user completely.Note that when you do ban a user, they will get a PM, from you, stating that they have been banned. As mod you can also train the spam filter to ""shadowban"" a user, if enough of his posts get flagged as spam the filter will start to remove future posts and comments, this can be useful for those users that love drama. 

**Respond to PMs from users**    
Users contact the moderators for a variety of reasons, including: 

- asking if their submissions have been caught in the spam filter
- asking for help or guidance with a variety of things
- to report inappropriate behavior by other redditors

Please be courteous and helpful when responding to users who are asking questions in good faith.If they are asking about the spam filter, the easiest thing to do is to go directly to their user page.You can see all bans and reports from there, and unban them as needed.Answer their questions if you can, and if you can’t, try to find someone who can, or have them post their question in /r/help.

I call it Easy Flair and I want to share it with other mods.,74,14,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/jc7q9/i_made_a_tool_that_makes_it_easier_to_give_users/,"Okay, I don't know how to write a backstory for this and everything but who cares why I made this, let's just jump right in!

### Introducing Easy Flair! `Version 2.6`

## What this does

So currently, in order to add Flair to a user, you need to copy the username, open your admin panel, enter the user's name, wait for a page to load, then copy paste the style you want to have and then hit save and wait. Even worse, if you messed up by just a bit, you have to do even more work to fix that issue.

**Who wants that**? I sure as hell don't.

Well, with **Easy Flair** it's so much *easier*.

1. Simply hover over a user's name.

2. Click on the flair you want to give to your user.

3. Wait about five seconds for the request to go through.

4. And **BOOM**. That user now has that flair!

It's super easy!

[Have some screenshots](http://roguedarkjedi.imgur.com/easy_flair)!

## Where can I get such a fantastic tool?

Well, since each subreddit is different, I wrote a generator to make the userscript for you! But hold on a second! Let's go over how to install.

## How to install

* If you have Chrome, follow the instructions [here](http://lifehacker.com/5919997/how-to-install-extensions-that-arent-from-the-official-chrome-web-store) on how to install.

* If you have Firefox, you need to install [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

* Opera users need to install [this](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/88932) first.

And I haven't tested it on any other browser.

## INSTALL!!!!

`--&gt;` [Click here to create a custom script for your subreddit](http://gamespotting.net/sandbox/easyFlairGen.php). `&lt;--`

## Notes

* **Remember to check back here for updates**. Additionally, you can signup for notifications [here](http://gamespotting.net/sandbox/updatebot).

* There is currently no way to set flair text with this script. 

* You need to have flair already set up on your subreddit, if you do not have flair on your subreddit already, this tool will do nothing.

* There cannot be any flair specific CSS rules before the main `.flair` block. So if you are hiding the toggle for flair via `form.toggle.flairtoggle` or you are hiding the flair so it only shows up on comment pages, you need to do that after the main `.flair` block. If you are confused or not sure if this applies to you, feel free to leave me a message and I can help you out.

* There is no way to remove flair using the script. To remove flair, you will need to do it via your Edit Flair page.

* If you find a bug or it doesn't work on your subreddit, please let me know.

## Success Stories

* ""We used RogueDarkJedi's script for /r/mylittlepony, and it made things waaaaay simpilier for the entire modteam. Ended up saving us loads of time."" - RainbowCrash ([mylittlepony](/r/mylittlepony))

* ""During the introduction of flair to our subreddit, there was a big response that was taking up a big chunk of the mod team's time. After RDJ wrote Easy Flair, granting a user's wanted flair was as easy as point-and-click. Saved us loads of time."" - IllusionOf_Integrity ([mylittlepony](/r/mylittlepony))

* ""Easy Flair made it phenomenally easy to give the people on my subreddit the flair they wanted without needing to hassle with a bot. Instead of searching for each person on the flair page, I only needed to make a quick click. Also, that RogueDarkJedi is one sexy beast."" - HeirToPendragon ([TheLastAirbender](/r/TheLastAirbender))

* ""Easy Flair is awesome and RDJ has a huge penis. Thanks for making our lives so much better."" - [Random_Acts_of_Pizza](/r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza) (specifically snang)

* ""/r/Assistance is very happy with Easy Flair! It is so much easier to point and click to add icons. RDJ helped a ton!!!!!"" - [Assistance](/r/Assistance)

## Misc

Basically, I want to hear your feedback. I love improving stuff, and I want to make Easy Flair the best it can be`*`.

`* without killing myself`

## Changelog

* 1.9 - Fixed undefined subreddit name. Thanks to KerrickLong for pointing out my mistake!

* 2.1 - Fixed panel being too small, now grabs width and height from the stylesheet. Make sure you have no other CSS rules that have the word `.flair` in them (if you do, move them to the end of the stylesheet) before you get to the main `.flair` block.

* 2.2 - Adds a couple of style rules and allows you to make a script that will work on modmail.

* 2.3 - Doesn't add the CSS `content` property to the selector, you can use on the index page now, set the width to be fixed, removes `:before`, `:after` and `:hover` selectors in the generation list that were causing bad output.

* 2.4 - Works again.

* 2.5 - Works on modmail again.

* 2.5 (Chrome) - Works correctly now.

* 2.6 - Added selector text and visual cues to help subreddits that have lots of flair. This is an option that is checked by default. Also fixed a bug that caused flair assignment previews to not work.

I have tested on my minor subreddits and it worked out just fine.

## Reddit Spam Notifier 1.4

---

### What this does

You know how redditors always bitch about being in spam? Don't you hate having to check that EVERY single day? 

Man, who the hell wants to spend 2-5 minutes on reddit checking queues when they could be looking at the latest Futurama Fry meme and then bitching about its overusage?

I know I hate having to check queues, I rather have them alert me to new items.

Well, this does just that.

[Screenshots](http://roguedarkjedi.imgur.com/spam_notifier)

### How does it work?

~~So basically, it scrapes your RSS feeds for the token and your username.~~

~~Once it has those, it will periodically (every six minutes) ping those RSS feeds to see if there are any new items (it detects this by seeing if the feed length is bigger, or if they are the same size, it will compare MD5 hashes).~~ NOPE CHUCK TESTA

**UPDATE**: This now uses the Reddit API to check your spam and mod report data.

When a change has been detected, the icon next to your modmail icon will light up.

### Installation

Reddit Spam Notifier works in Chrome and Firefox.

You need [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) if you use Firefox, and if you use Chrome, you can install the chrome extension of this script [here](http://gamespotting.net/sandbox/crx/spam_notifier.crx) or via the webstore by going [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jlceeicfbmbpfjjndoeebeaknlpejcpi)

Install the script **[here](http://gamespotting.net/sandbox/spam_notifier.user.js)**.

**Optional**: You can sign up for update notifications for this script by signing up [here](http://gamespotting.net/sandbox/updatebot/). Just check the box that says ""Reddit Spam Notifier"".

### Additional notes

* The script will do NOTHING if you are not a moderator of any subreddit. Don't bother installing if you don't mod a sub.

* When you first install this, do note that you'll probably be told that you have new items. This is just the script reacting to initial data. Once you check your queue, it will not light up until you get new items again.

* Checking your queue is the way to make it understand you have read these items.

* You can run into false positives, but it should be extremely rare with version 1.3, let me know if this isn't the case.

### Update log

Version 1.1:   
* Fixed a regular expression that would cause it to not clear unless you clicked on a subreddit manage link  
* Changed the link the alert item takes you to

Version 1.2:   
* Fixed localStorage bug in Chrome

Version 1.3:   
* Added autoclearing (if another mods clears out the modqueue, the alert will automatically reset on next check)  
* Fixed some bad data problems that caused the script to fire an alert even when you had no new items in your modqueue.

Version 1.4:  
* No more feeds!  
* Other fixes.

1309534001.0,45,self.modhelp,ie9og,Would anyone be interested in having their reddits participate in a No Pics Day?,73,28,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/ie9og/would_anyone_be_interested_in_having_their/,"**update:** rhinofinger has provided us with a [logo](http://i.imgur.com/Kd16O.png) if anyone would like to use it tomorrow.

**edit:** Just made a semi-official announcement in [/r/reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iem31/ever_wonder_what_reddit_would_look_like_without/). Feel free to link to it or put it in your sidebar in your reddit if you want to support No Pics Day.

No Pics Day is a suggestion I raised over at [Theory of Reddit](http://redd.it/idjjf). With several reddits (like [fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/id71z/mods_you_may_want_to_watch_this_rfitness_is/) and [gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/icoif/who_wants_to_reduce_the_flagrant_karmawhoring_and/)\) starting initiatives of their own, I thought it might be worthwhile trying to put together a reddit-wide event.

**What are we talking about here?** Think of it as the polar opposite of Critical Mass. Image posts have grown so popular on reddit that it's difficult for other sorts of content to get by. Right now, for example, 18 out of the top 25 posts on /r/all are image posts. The respective front pages of a number of popular reddits are likewise swamped with image submissions, leaving very little room for news and articles.

What I'm suggesting is a single day where we each take it upon ourselves to give other types of content a fighting chance. Ideally, for that one day, at least, the front page would show a broader diversity of content.

**Is this even a problem? After all, if people didn't like pics, they wouldn't make it to the top of the hot queue, right?** Maybe, but as has been pointed out before, image submissions have certain advantages over other kinds of submission that make them more likely to attract votes. For one thing, they demand less time on the part of the voter than an article, which means they can climb faster. When the number of pic submission making it into a reddit's new queue hits a certain threshold, they can start to push other kinds of content out of view even before potential voters have time to read and assess the value of those other links. I discuss that at more length [here](http://redd.it/glm65) if you're interested.

No Pic Day is about giving those other sorts of content a little breathing room so that they don't have to compete against a flood of pic submissions.

**Okay, but how?** On a day agreed upon in advance, we simply don't vote on pics, and refrain as much as possible from submitting them. I'm not talking about voting them down -- we're not out to make them unwelcome on reddit or punish people for posting them. All I'm asking is that, for a single day, we reserve the power of the vote for other sorts of content.

**Okay, I'm in, but how are we going to get everyone else to go along?** Realistically, we're not. We shouldn't expect everyone on reddit to participate. A more realistic goal is simply to get enough people involved to make a difference.

And that's why I'm contacting /r/modhelp. Top-down support can go a long way toward getting something like this off of the ground. If you're interested in seeing what reddit looks like when we take the emphasis off of pics for a day, you can help by getting the communities you moderate involved. If you mod it with several other people, talk it over and decide whether or not your reddit will endorse and agree to participate. If you're in, announce your endorsement to your community in advance. On No Pic Day, add a note to your sidebar, or use CSS to add a No Pic Day message to the yellow explanation box at the top of your submission page. Encourage your subscribers to play along.

**What if I run a reddit that's specifically for posting images?** We'd love to have your help, but we'll understand if you decide not to play along.

If you *are* interested, though, there are things you could do. Image-centric reddits, like /r/F7U12 and /r/pics, could encourage people to continue posting, but to refrain from voting on submissions. If they wanted to have a little fun with it (a la /r/trees pretending to be about actual trees) they could turn on the ""self posts only"" option and just have people describe pictures and script hypothetical rage comics all day. We're open to suggestions.

Right now, we're talking about No Pics day being **this coming Wednesday**, July 6th. No Pics Day shouldn't require a lot of preparation, but that's not a lot of time, so if you need to discuss it with your communities, please do so sooner rather than later.

If you have any questions, suggestions, objections or anything else that ends with -tions, now's the time to offer them up.

Thanks.

1. **Skip `http://www.reddit.com`.**

    Since you're already on reddit.com, you can save yourself 21 characters by removing `http://www.reddit.com` from your links. Example:

        [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)
        [reddiquette](/help/reddiquette)

2. **Use short links for posts.**

    Take advantage of the short-link facilities provided by reddit to save yourself characters on links to reddit posts. For example, these go to the same place:

        [AutoModerator](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/)
        [AutoModerator](http://redd.it/q11pu)

    As it happens, though, we can do even better than that. `http://redd.it/&lt;shortlink&gt;` and `http://www.reddit.com/&lt;shortlink&gt;` both go to the same place, so we can save even more characters by combining that knowledge with trick #1 above:

        [AutoModerator](/q11pu)

    This lets you link to any thread in 6-7 characters.


3. **Skip the title for comments and posts with parameters.**

    If you want to link to a comment from your sidebar, or if you want to link to a post with changed parameters (using `?sort=new`, for instance, or `?limit=500` to load extra comments), the above trick won't work. You'll need to use some other tricks to slim down.

    _For comments:_

    The title portion of a comment link is ignored by the code. You can replace it with whatever you'd like - for instance, an underscore, or the letter ""c"". That lets you make this change:

        [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/10ymie/reddit_change_a_small_rules_reddiquette_reminder/c6i81hk)
        [comment](/r/changelog/comments/10ymie/c/c6i81hk)


    _For posts with parameters:_

    You can safely skip everything after the id32 (the 5 or 6-character code used in the shortlink). You won't be able to use trick #2, though, because the redirect that happens strips away the parameters. The result looks like this:

        [Easy Flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/jc7q9/i_made_a_tool_that_makes_it_easier_to_give_users/?sort=new)
        [Easy Flair](/r/modhelp/comments/jc7q9?sort=new)

    _For both:_

    If you don't need your subreddit CSS to be applied, you can save even more characters by skipping your subreddit name in the link:

        [comment](/r/changelog/comments/10ymie/c/c6i81hk)
        [comment](/comments/10ymie/c/c6i81hk)

        [Easy Flair](/r/modhelp/comments/jc7q9?sort=new)
        [Easy Flair](/comments/jc7q9?sort=new)

4. **Take advantage of autolinking.**

    Remember, you can link to subreddits by using `/r/&lt;subreddit&gt;`, and to user pages by using `/u/&lt;username&gt;`. That lets you save even the square brackets and parentheses needed to make a link under normal circumstances.

        [/r/modhelp](/r/modhelp)
        /r/modhelp

        [qgyh2](/user/qgyh2)
        /u/qgyh2

5. **Use Markdown tricks.**

    Linking to the same thing in multiple places on your sidebar? Use this trick built into the Markdown spec. (Markdown is the name of the comment markup used by reddit.)

        [Link #1](/r/modhelp)
        [Link #2](/r/modhelp)

        -------------------

        [Link #1][tag]
        [Link #2][tag]

        . . .

        [tag]: /r/modhelp

    `tag`, in this instance, can be any string you'd like, as long or as short as you'd like. The definition line (`[tag]: /r/modhelp`) should go at the very bottom of your sidebar.

Reddit provides some core features in the mods arsenal that are indeed nothing more as the most basic things you need as mod. In order to remedy this a lot of people have created a myriad of userscripts in order to add or enhance functionality to the moderator arsenal on reddit. This has resulted in a fragmented landscape with a few very good scripts but more often userscripts that are not compatible, outdated or just plain confusing in usage. 

Based on this fragmented landscape /u/agentlame and I have tasked ourself to bring some order in the chaos. We have started to organise the toolbox available to mods in a set of userscripts that can be easily found at /r/toolbox. Some of the scripts that can be found there are based on existing scripts but updated to meet demand (enhanced modtools based on DEADB33F's awesome modtools, and much of his code is reused in our other scripts!), other features were written from scratch since the functionality did not exist. At /r/toolbox all the scripts are compatible with each other where our *long term* goal is to a make a complete set of utilities that can be installed a la carte as userscripts, but also a single suite extension similar to RES.  Though, for now, we're focusing on adding features and making everything really stable and useable.

We would love to get some feedback about what you think of the current tools, if you have any issues, how you would change or improve them; what you would add/remove/make optional.  We're also be interested in more general ideas of what would make your job easier as a mod.  Is there a mod feature you always wish reddit had that you'd like to see?  Even if it sounds crazy, if it can be done via a userscript or extension, we would be more than happy to look into making it.   

Please be sure to check for updates on a regular basis.  While I can't say we'll keep this pace forever, right now development of new features is moving pretty rapidly.  So something you request today could very well be added tomorrow.

Lastly, if you mod a relevant subreddit, we'd love it if you could add a link to /r/toolbox to your sidebar.

I am making this post here as per recommendation of /u/krispykrackers .

The full story is far too long to post here, so I will be summarizing as much as possible. I can provide details upon request.

The basic story is as follows:

I recently contacted /u/LordGaGa, the only moderator of [/r/twilightsparkle](/r/twilightpsarkle)^1 asking if I could have moderation privileges on the subreddit. LordGaGa had had the subreddit for 5 months nearly since its inception, and had done little to nothing on it:

* LordGaGa changed the logo
* Very few things were posted. Only 1 or 2 a month. Mostly by people other than LordGaGa.
* Subreddit has been dead for the entirety of its existence
* Basically, the opposite of everything [in this guide](http://www.reddit.com/f2yoa).
* I should also note that according to research I have done by talking to older members of the [/r/mylittlepony](/r/mylittlepony) community and doing a metareddit stalk, LordGaGa has not been involved in the MLP community for a very long time.

I sent LordGaGa my request simply because, as a fan of that particular character, I felt that I could do a lot more with the subreddit. After an initial no, I persuaded LordGaGa to give me access, but she still wanted to stick around. (Which was no big deal to me.)

So I started off by working with a friend to prepare a new theme, emotes^2, and flair; all in order to make the subreddit more inviting and personal-feeling. You can view what it looked like in [my test subreddit](/r/pathogendavidstest2).

From there I updated the subreddit, posted some content, made an announcement, asked friends to post some content, went out and asked artists making relevant content to post it there, etc.

I was then informed by LordGaGa that she was reversing my ""SFW content only"" rule and allowing NSFW content. LordGaGa also started cross-posting content from \/r/clopclop. However, I did not directly protest any of this, because I knew I was lucky to just be there. Well, the community (as small as it was) did not like it and her two posts were downvoted pretty hard. Which, I belive, set her off and I come back to a ""forbidden"" page. So it seems that LordGaGa removed me as a moderator and set the subreddit to private.

I have contacted LordGaGa several times, all to no avail. They are completely ignoring me at this point, not even offering an explanation for their actions.

--------------

I would simply like [/r/twilightsparkle](/r/twilightsparkle) to be restored so it can exist as a community again.

I look forward to seeing it implemented and I have high hopes that it will allow for better community policing.  

Also, thanks very much for stepping up the updates.  I was sorry to see jedberg go but I'm delighted to see you guys having the ability to prioritize rolling up your sleeves and delivering community *improvements* rather than simply bailing out the bilgewater.  I hope this is a trend you can all afford to continue because the time you invest in usability pays us back a thousandfold.

I will admit that I am concerned, however, because the paradigm pursued by Reddit Inc. remains ""five guys in a 30x30 room in San Francisco holding the keys to a kingdom 800,000 strong.""

To quote [Vinod Khosla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla), ""If it doesn't scale, it doesn't matter.""  Your improvements, as great as they are, are largely to simplify the process by which your users can increase your taskload.  And while I'm sure this will make it easier for you to do stuff for us, I think we can all agree that Reddit is likely to see its millionth reader *long* before it will see its tenth full-time employee.  

*In other words, you're solving the problems you already had, not looking forward to the problems you're in for.*

The more I look at the problem, the more I think Reddit needs something like Wikipedia's moderation system.  At the very least, we the moderators need more power, more responsiveness and more functionality that bypasses you, the bottleneck.  I would like to see you guys in a position where you are insulated from charges of favoritism and left to the task of keeping the ship running and improving the feature set, rather than attempting to police a million, two million or five million users out of a sub-lease in Wired's offices.  And I think we're more than capable of doing it, particularly if we have to work together to accomplish anything.

The ""rogue moderator"" always comes up as an excuse for limiting moderator power.  This is a red herring; there is no subreddit that an admin can't completely restructure on a whim (see: /r/LosAngeles) and there is no subreddit that can't be completely abandoned and reformed elsewhere (see: /r/trees).  Much of the frustration with moderators is that what power we *do* have we have fundamentally without oversight and what power we *do* have isn't nearly enough to get the job done.  The end result is frustrated people distrusted by the public without the tools to accomplish anything meaningful but the burden of being the public face of policing site-wide.  And really, this comes down to two types of issue:  **community** and **spam.**  First:

*   *   *  

**Spam.**  Let's be honest: /r/reportthespammers is the stupidest, most cantankerous stopgap on the entire website.  It wasn't your idea, you don't pay nearly enough attention to it and it serves the purpose of immediately alerting any savvy spammer to the fact that it's time to change accounts.  Yeah, we've got dedicated heroes in there doing a yeoman's job of protecting the new queue but I'll often ""report a spammer"" only to see that they've been reported three times in the past six months and nothing has been done about it.  

On the other hand, I've been using [this script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/82709) for over a year now and it works marvelously.  It's got craploads of data, too.  Yet when I tried to pass it off to raldi, he didn't even know what to do with it - you guys have no structure in place to address our lists!

**how about this:**  Take the idea of the ""report"" button that's currently in RES and instead of having it autosubmit to /r/RTS, have it report to *you.*  When I click ""report as spam"" I want it to end up in *your* database.  I want your database to start keeping track of the number of ""spam reports"" called on any given IP address.  I want your database to start keeping track of the number of ""spam reports"" associated with any given URL.  And when your database counts to a number (Your choice of number, and that number as reported by *unique IPs* - I can't be the only person reporting the spam lest we run afoul of that whole ""rogue mod"" thing), *you guys shadowban it.*  I don't care if you make it automatic or make it managed; if the way *you* deal with spammers is by shadowbanning the way *we* deal with spammers shouldn't be attempting to shame them in the public square.

If you want to be extra-special cool, once I've reported someone as spam, change that ""report as spam"" button into ""reported"" and gray it out.  Better yet?  Inform me when someone I've reported gets shadowbanned!  you don't have to tell me who it was, you don't have to tell me who else reported them, you don't have to tell me anything... but give me a little feedback on the fact that I'm helping you guys out and doing my job as a citizen.  *Better than that?*  Gimme a goddamn trophy.  You wanna see spam go down to nothing on Reddit, start giving out ""spam buster"" trophies.  You'll see people setting up honeypot subreddits just to attract spammers to kill.  /r/realestate is a mess; violentacrez testifies that /r/fashion is worse.  We know what subreddits the spammers are going to target.  Lots of us work in SEO.  Let us ape the tools you have available to you rather than taking a diametrically-opposed approach and watch how much more effective the whole process becomes.

*Which brings us to*

*   *   *   

**Community.**  How does Reddit deal with abusive users?  Well, it doesn't.  Or didn't before now.  But the approach proposed is still very much in the ""disappear them"" way of thinking: hide the moderator doing the banning.  Blacklist PMs from abusive users.  Whitelist certain users for difficult cases.  But as stated, the only two ways to get yourself kicked out of your account are doxing and shill-voting.

Again, this is a case where reporting to *you* is something that can be handled in an automated fashion.  That automated fashion can be overridden or supervised by you, but to a large extent it *really* doesn't have to be.  Here, check this out.

I, as a moderator, have the ability to ban users.  This is a permanent sort of thing that doesn't go away without my reversal.  What I *don't* have is the ability to *police* users.  Just like the modqueue autoban, this is something that should be completely automated and plugged into a database on your end.  Here's what I would like to happen:

1) I click ""police"" on a post.  This sends that post to your database.  You run a query on it - if you find what reads out like an address, a phone number, an email, a web page, a zip code (maybe any 2?) it goes to your ""red phone"" as dropped dox.  Should you verify it to be dropped dox, you f'ing shadowban that mofo right then and there.  Meanwhile, you automagically query that account for possible alts and analyze it for shill voting.  If it's been shill voting, you either warn or shadowban, I don't care which - the point is to get that username in the system.  In the meantime, by ""policing"" that post I remove it from my subreddit and nobody else has to deal with it.

2) By ""policing"" a user in my subreddit, that user experiences a 1-day shadowban *in my subreddit.*  They can tear around and run off at the mouth everywhere else but in my subreddit, they're in the cone of silence.  Not only that, but the user is now in your database as someone who has been policed for abuse.

3) If that same user (whose IP you have, and are tracking, along with their vote history) is policed by a different moderator in a *different subreddit* then the user gets a 1-day shadowban *site wide.*  This gives them a chance to calm down, spin out and let go.  Maybe they come back the next day and they're human again.  If not,

4) The second time a user gets policed by more than one subreddit he gets shadowbanned for a week sitewide.  If this isn't enough time to calm his ass down, he's a pretty hard case.  If it is, you haven't perma-banned anybody... you've given them a time-out.  In my experience they won't even notice.

5) If the user continues to be policed they pop to the top of your database reports.  At this point they've been policed by multiple moderators in multiple subreddits multiple times.  ***MUTHERFUCKING SHOOT THEM IN THE MUTHERFUCKING HEAD.***  I know you really, really, really want to keep this whole laissez-faire let-the-site-run-itself ethic in place but for fuck's sake, you're doing yourself no favors by permitting anyone who has been policed all over the place to continue to aggravate your userbase.  Ban those shitheads.

*   *    *   

These changes would hand over control of spam and control of community policing to your users.  Better than that, it's a blind, distributed ban: yeah, moderators could band together to report a user but c'mon.  You still have ultimate power and I can't imagine any drama like this in which the whole site doesn't scream bloody murder on both sides anyway.  By and large, *we're the ones with the headsman's axe.*  You go back to doing what you should be doing: administrating.

It isn't full-on Wikipedia but it fits the paradigm of upvotes and downvotes.  It gives your moderators the power to moderate, rather than simply tattle.  And it leverages the voluminous amounts of data you guys have rather than requiring you to hand-code every embargoed username.

I've read some threads about this here on /r/modhelp and it seems like this is an issue for lots of people with small subs. However, I haven't found a real solution so far. In the threads I've read, they said to disable the downvote arrow (which doesn't help if the downvotes come from /r/all or if the downvoter disables subreddit style) and basically hope for the best, since nothing can be done to really fix it.  
Something that helps would be upvoting the zero'ed post with my other (test) account, but this is very uncool and I'd rather not do it.

As far as I can tell, this is a problem with the karma algorithm itself. Do you think there would be any chance to get this algorithm tweaked, so small subs can't be trolled so easily? It seems wrong to me that a single person could kill legitimate content so easily. I think nobody with a small sub posts content for karma anyway, I know I don't.

Re: Infringement of Photobucket Trademark and Violation of Terms of Use

To Whom It May Concern:

We represent Photobucket.com, Inc., (“PBI”) operator of the well-known photo storage and sharing website Photobucket. PBI is the owner of the registered trademarks PHOTOBUCKET (Reg. No. 3242446) and PHOTOBUCKET &amp; camera design (Reg. No. 3279875). PBI launched the Photobucket service in 2003. It quickly became a “go to” site for photo sharing. In the past five years, Photobucket has gone from having 21 million users and 2 billion images to having approximately net 75 million users, who collectively have posted more than 8 billion images and 28 million videos to the website. Photobucket continues to grow. Each month, over one million new users join Photobucket, and over 4.5 million new images are uploaded daily. Photobucket is used to host images and is the default photo sharing platform for Twitter, one of the most popular social media services in the world.
In light of the extensive promotion of it mark and the rapid adoption and success of the service, PHOTOBUCKET has come to be recognized by consumers as designating a web-based photo storage and sharing service originating with PBI. PBI’s is recognized for its high quality and PBI has built up significant goodwill in the mark PHOTOBUCKET.
As part of its Terms of Use, visitors to the Photobucket website agree, among other things, not to: • use viruses, bots, worms, or any other computer code, files or programs that interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware, or otherwise permit the unauthorized use of or access to a computer or a computer network; • interfere with the access of any User, host or network to the Site; • cover or obscuring the banner advertisements on your personal profile page, or any Photobucket page via HTML/CSS or any other means, whether by HTML, CSS or some other coding on your personal profile page, including, without limitation, any hidden or otherwise surreptitiously contained code in the Content which is unrelated to the immediate aesthetic nature of the Content; • make any automated use of the system, such as, but not limited to, using scripts to send images or videos; interfering with, disrupting, or creating an undue burden on the Photobucket Services or the networks or services connected to the Photobucket Services; • collect or store personal data about other users without their express permission, including collecting usernames, User I.D. numbers, and/or email addresses of Users by electronic or other means for the purpose of sending unsolicited email or unauthorized framing of or linking to the Site; • scrape the Site by the use of crawlers, bots or other automated mechanisms. It has come to PBI’s attention that you are violating PBI’s Terms of Use by means of the subReddit /r/requestaplunder which either performs, enables or encourages “fuskering” of the Photobucket site. You are improperly accessing private photo albums on the site via an automated means without permission of the account holders and in a manner that makes the images available without the surrounding site banners and information, all in violation of Photobucket’s Terms of Use. The fuskering is also causing PBI monetary damage due to a loss of good will, increased burden on its servers, administrative time and expense to address additional customer service and support needs. Your actions thus violates the Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030. Moreover, the name and graphics used for your subreddit infringe PBI’s registered trademarks. In particular, r/requestaplunder uses a graphic.

This graphic is a clear imitation of PBI’s registered PHOTOBUCKET &amp; camera logo mark and constitutes unfair competition and trademark infringement in violation of the Lanham Act.
It addition, it appears that you are violating the Reddit User Agreement which prohibits you from using posting material to the website that infringes the trademark of another party. The agreement also prohibits you from posting or providing materials that violates the rights of others. The unauthorized access to Photobucket albums via fuskering also violates the album owner’s proprietary rights and rights of privacy to personal photographs of an intimate and private nature.
We therefore demand that you immediately remove and disable the subreddit requestaplunder. We look forward to receiving written confirmation from you by no later than August 24, 2012 that you have removed the referenced subreddit. If we do not hear from you by that date, PBI will consider taking whatever further steps it deems necessary to address this infringement and the breach of its terms. Please direct all future inquiries to the undersigned. In the interim, PBI reserves all its rights at law and in equity. Very truly yours,

I tried reporting it to the mods of s sub but never heard back. It also seems to be happening in more than one sub.

tl;dr - Found dozens of accounts with similar user names who all report other people's OC from the same different subreddit. All the accounts were created exactly 5 months ago and never comment, ever.

I am not sure exactly what they are doing, but I think maybe they are building a ""karma army"" to resell the accounts or to sell a ""we can get you to the front page"" service. Right now (almost 1am EST) 8 or 9 of the top 10 posts on the front page or r/lookatmydog are scam posts in my opinion. I noticed a pattern and did some digging.

Here's how I noticed it:

I happened to notice all of a sudden a third of the top pictures on r/lookatmydog were pictures of corgis. I thought it was one person karma-whoring, then I saw the user names were different. However they all had a similar pattern to the names. They all had semi-words with a few numbers. I also noticed that all the pics on the front page that had these similar names were all submitted ""an hour ago"". It is not a hugely popular sub, so it is not usual to see a front page with links submitted and assortment of 4 or 7 or 11 hours ago. Here are a ton of pictures of corgis, all submitted at about the same time and all submitted from accounts with similar nonsensical username.

As I looked at each username's page, they were all accounts that were created 5 months ago, and most never posted before. A few had posted once before, that day, all of them had posted to r/girlswithglasses or r/cats or a similar subreddit where people post pictures of things people like to get upvotes, usually with a lot of OC. None of the users had commented ever.

When I clicked on the imgur links, I clicked on the ""source"" link which directed me back to where it was originally submitted to reddit. It always looked like an OC corgi pic, and was always submitted to r/corgi by someone else between 1 and 2 months ago. The thing is, the link submitted recently by the scammer on r/lookatmydog used the exact same title as original submitted to r/corgi months earlier. Sometimes when the original submission had a dash in the title, it was missing in the scammer submitted link, so I am wondering if that is an indication of a bot.

1316089262.0,21,self.modhelp,kgfrx,I am a mod of /r/themepark. Here is a guide to the promotion of the reddit I have done over the last 2 years. This might help you or maybe you can help me come up with some new ideas? ,27,6,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/kgfrx/i_am_a_mod_of_rthemepark_here_is_a_guide_to_the/,"[**/r/themepark**](/r/themepark) is a subreddit made up of theme park enthusiasts who love theme parks. It is a pretty common hobby and our subreddit is the only one who has information about general theme parks. 

The goal of any subreddit should be to get 1000 readers that self-sustains itself with active submitters and caring moderators.

To promote the subreddit, here is what I have done:

**Submit posts to subreddits that promote new reddits.**

[/r/newreddits](/r/newreddits), [/r/shamelessplug](/r/shamelessplug), and [/r/pluggit](/r/pluggit) to name a few. I submit a post once every 3-4 months to hopefully attract new readers. For advertising subreddits, this works as a beginning push. If you get downvoters early, then your subreddit will probably not make it. So hopefully, you will get the attention of a few redditors and they will help subscribe. If things go well, you may possibly get a 100 subscribers doing this, but most likely it will be somewhere between 20-50 on average each time. Before posting to these subreddits, make sure you show that you care about it. Add some CSS, create a clear sidebar description, add a logo, and fill your subreddit with recent submissions. If your subreddit looks good, they would be more likely to join. 

**Make a submission to [/r/pimpmyreddit](/r/pimpmyreddit).**

This subreddit is ran by admins and it is created to promoting subreddits in the picture ad box on the right. This picture box is seen by a LOT of people. Remember though, your chances of getting picked for this are slim to none. Unless your subreddit promotes giving puppies to children dieing of cancer, do not expect to get picked. Come up with a neat looking promo, and you might attract subscribers of the reddit to your subreddit, the same way with /r/newreddits. 

Alternatively, you might be able to get a free promotion text ad at $20 for 2 days in this subreddit, but that won't amount to much. Prior to this subreddit being created, I contacted the admins about my predicament and they were willing to give me one when I asked that there should be a proper way for subreddits to be promoted. Now that this subreddit has been created, do NOT plead with an admin for a submission. /r/pimpmyreddit was created specifically for that purpose. 

**Paying for a text ad to be displayed**

Do NOT do this! While the money helps out reddit, which is good, it will most likely not help your subreddit. When I did this, I put down $40 for 2 days. It amounted to 10 subscribers and there were a few posts of people complaining that I had a hidden agenda of selling something, which was very much NOT true. You would really need to spend a lot of money to make it work and you really shouldn't be THAT invested in your subreddit unless you actually are trying to sell something. 

**Trade sidebar description links with other subreddits to your subreddit**

For a steady stream of subscribers over a year, this is your best bet. Expect a sidebar link to bring you 1% of another reddit's subscribers over 1 year. This would mean readers would have to visit the subreddit, read the description, decide to click on the link to your subreddit, and then decide to become a reader of your subreddit. I did this for /r/birdpics, and got on the /r/pics subreddit, and it worked perfectly. I didn't need to do any advertising after that. 

When asking another subreddit to add a link to your subreddit, it is best to reach out to subreddits that have something in common. The larger the subreddit, the better. You could try reaching subreddits that you don't have much in common with, but you would have to do something creative in return. For example, I contacted ~100 subreddit cities that have theme park locations. I then offered to have a link to their subreddit with a list of notable theme parks in their area. convincing redditors from my subreddit to visit their subreddit. But, in the end, most of these subreddits didn't really see a connection and decided not to link. You would have the same reaction to asking reddits that have nothing to do with your subreddit, which I have done, but the chance of success is slim. 

**Cross posts and comment links**

This is something that is popular to do for subreddits and if done right, can mean the difference from being small to becoming a large subreddit. Clearly mark your post as (x-post from [your subreddit]) that works well in that subreddit.  The thing is, the ""Knights of New"" are not fans of cross post submissions. A lot of times you will end up with quite a few downvotes and your submission will go nowhere. 

The same results could occur with posting a link to your subreddit in comments. It is best to make sure that discussing your subreddit is on topic with the discussion. As said before, you will either get downvoted or be successful depending on enthusiasm from the conversation. 

The major problem with x-posts is the inability to promote quickly in other subreddits. You would have to wait 8 minutes, then 9 minutes, and then be told that your links aren't doing well (which is usually not true) and won't be allowed to post the link further at all. So when doing x-posts, make sure it is one subreddit that it really applies to. 

**Tag your subreddit and promote it in communities outside of Reddit**

There are a few communities outside of reddit that are made specifically for promoting subreddits. For example, http://metareddit.com/ allows you to tag your subreddit so other people can find it easier. I have had no 
success with this. 

**Improve your CSS** 

There are some links on the sidebar to the right. Use them! 

**Make valuable submitters in other reddits approved submitters**

One thing I would like to add that is not in there, is search for submissions about the topic for your reddit and make the authors approved submitters. People consider it an honor, but you will have to explain why you added them. I did this for experts in theme parks. For 30 approved submitters, I've gotten about 10 high-quality subscribers.

-------

In the end, I have a subreddit with 181 readers. I have not been successful with mine, and maybe there is a reason for that, but I hope my story helps you figure out the best way to promote your subreddit. And maybe, you can post below some ideas of your own that might be better? 

**Update**: In the past two weeks I have gained 87 readers, to a total of 268 readers. I had to work had every single day, but it has somewhat paid off, but not to the number you would hope for.

Easy to break or ignore.

I know this will be a bit left-of-topic for this board, but I can't think of a more appropriate place to ask this question than the moderator help board.  /r/SubredditDrama is far, far, far from what I'm looking for.  I want to know what actual, experienced mods think about this issue.

I will not cite any particular examples so as to avoid starting some kind of drama festival - that's not what I'm looking to do with this post.  

-----------------

I expect this will be a touchy subject, but I'm really looking for some constructive advice.  My question is simple, but I want to be specific, so please forgive me if I ramble.

What do the moderators of /r/modhelp, think is and is not appropriate for users of a subreddit to do when they feel their mods are not acting in the best interest of the community - or worse, are acting in bad faith toward that community?

On a particular subreddit, moderators obviously have total control over the discussion.  They can ban users and posts as they please, which is why the modiquette guidelines are what they are.  They are capable of a level of control over their community that is a huge responsibility, and tools which ought only to be treated with respect.  When these tools are being misused or abused, there appears to be no official mechanism users can use to protest.

I expect a lot of people are going to answer that the users should make a new subreddit in that situation, but do you feel that way even in the case that the main subreddit is the obvious first destination for other new users?  For example, if the subreddit's topic was discussion of Chiron Beta Prime, obviously /r/ChironBetaPrime would be the choice subreddit, and /r/ChironiansBPRIME might be so unobvious that no one will ever find it except by referral.  There have been successful examples of subreddit fissions - /r/Games spun off from /r/gaming to what I believe is great benefit to both communities, but if you're dealing with a community who loves the guitar, they aren't going to want to settle for anything other than /r/Guitar . 

Should users fight to try and win back their communities in such a case?  **Can** users fight back to try and win their communities in such a case?  Or should they grin and bear it and learn to bear an inferior community just because the alternative would be a ghetto of a community?

We need your help!

Many subreddits have custom menus that link visitors to other relevant sites (some good examples are r/trees and r/harrypotter).  Currently, this is done with messy hacks that creatively use CSS and Reddit's text formatting.  We would like to make this functionality native.  Basically, we want to add a panel to the community settings page that would easily let you copy/paste links into text boxes, save, and the links magically appear at the top of the subreddit with some nice default styling (which, of course, you can change with your own CSS).  

So - what do you think of this idea?  Useful or useless?  We're particularly interested in hearing how you'd like us to extend this functionality - as of now we simply want to make it possible to add the same menus that already exist (but through the settings panel and not CSS hacks), but there are other improvements we could make from there.  How about submenus/drop-down menus?  The option to put the menu somewhere else on the page?  If there's some consensus about an idea for improvement then we'll do our best to put it in.

Feel free to skip it and just answer the question in the comments. Obviously this is a throwaway account.

I mod for several subreddits but only one of them is of any significant size. When I first discovered it there were only about 100 readers. Now there are about 50,000. The change in size is due to me. The head mod, its creator, never really gave a shit. He's a good guy, don't get me wrong, but he has never been very active. He just had the idea for the subreddit first and remains content to allow me to do all the actual work.

Before reddit even had the flair system I figured out how to give our users flair using CSS. It was awkward and time consuming but I did it god dammit. I also prettied up the page and eventually recruited some people more artistic than I to help out with all that. I grew our mod team, stayed involved with the community, and helped set the atmosphere that we now all enjoy. 

I have put a lot of hard fucking work into this subreddit. But guess what? We just had our best of awards. Two mods were nominated for various things. I was not one of them.

Mod3 and Mod4 are people I brought on earlier this year mainly to help with the modqueue (it had gotten to the point that I was the only person ever checking it so I demanded we hire a couple more mods; Head Mod agreed). Both of them had posts of theirs nominated for the awards. And while neither of them won, I find myself pulling my hair out in anger because in the comments so many people are saying things like: ""Mod3! You're the best [subredditor] here! You should have won!"" or: ""Mod4 I can't believe you didn't win! If anyone deserves this award it's you for all the hard work you've put into this subreddit!""

Makes. Me. Want. To. Punch. Someone.

Look, Mod3 and Mod4 are good. They're fine and decent people. But everyone seems to love them and give them credit for everything even though I'm the one who has done all the work! I was here at the beginning. I guided our subreddit through the dark times and the choppy waters. I have been steadfast in making sure that our community doesn't go down the ""power tripping mod"" road by always involving the community in any major decisions. Hell, I even offered to resign once after banning someone who didn't deserve it (long story). 

In short: our subreddit wouldn't be shit if it wasn't for all the fucking hours and *hours* and **hours** of work I've put into it. Meanwhile Head Mod still ""owns"" the subreddit even though he doesn't do shit and Mod3 and Mod4 get all the love from the community because they're always quick to say something popular in certain threads. Meanwhile, here's me in the background, doing the actual work and making the decisions that truly matter for the subreddit. But do I ever get a thanks? Nope. Well, maybe the occasional generic, ""You mods are great!"" comment... usually posted as a reply to Mod3 or Mod4.

It's beyond aggravating. I love modding and I love the community ~~we've~~ I've created. I'm just sick and tired of not being recognized for my hard work. A couple of weeks ago I actually had someone ""correct"" me on a rule in the comments to a thread. My reply was, ""No, the rule is [this]. I should know, I wrote it."". I got downvoted to -10 or something like that until I distinguished that post. 

Mod3 and Mod4? Their names are famous in our subreddit. Mine? Not so much.

1290730679.0,21,self.modhelp,ebty4,Tutorial: How to create a automatic Twitter account for your subreddit.,26,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/ebty4/tutorial_how_to_create_a_automatic_twitter/,"This tutorial will allow you to create a twitter account for your subreddit that automatically tweets new submissions. It will also show you how to place a twitter logo in your sidebar.

For an example of this in action, see [twitter.com/BritishTVreddit](http://twitter.com/britishtvreddit) and [/r/BritishTV](/r/britishtv).

For more technically-minded redditors who are comfortable running a python script, Ketralnis has written [this bot](http://github.com/ketralnis/reddittweeter) which powers [@reddit](http://twitter.com/reddit)

***

###Step One: Create your twitter account.

1. If you need instructions for this I'd give up now.

2. Stay logged into this new account during the following steps.

***

###Step Two: Locate your reddit RSS feed.

1. Almost every reddit page can be turned into an RSS feed simply by adding the suffix `.rss`. Using this subreddit as an example it would be: `http://reddit.com/r/modhelp.rss`

2. You can either use your main page, or the New page for the feed: `http://reddit.com/r/subreddit.rss` **or** `http://reddit.com/r/subreddit/new.rss`

3. Private pages and subreddits are more tricky, but not impossible. Ask me if you need assistance with this.

***

###Step Three: Create a TwitterFeed account.

Go to http://twitterfeed.com and open an account. 

&gt;This site uses OpenID, which means you can sign in via Google or other major website accounts. Twitterfeed does not see your personal login info.

2. Click *Create new feed*, enter your RSS feed and name it.    

3. Click *Advanced settings* and use these settings:    

    * Frequency: **30 mins**    
    * Number of submissions: **5**         

    (If your subreddit has more than 5 submissions every half hour you're out of luck unless you use ketralnis' bot)        

    * Post Content: **Title Only**    
    * Post Link: **Tick this** otherwise the tweet will not link to the submission.    
    * I also add the hashtag `#reddit` as a suffix.    

4. Continue to the next page and select Twitter as the publishing platform. If you are still logged into your new account it will authorise.

5. The process is now finished!

***

###Step Four: Creating your sidebar Twitter logo.

1.  Save [this](http://imgur.com/ZKuu3) image to your desktop as `twitter.png`    

2.  Go to your subreddit's editing page and insert this link to the sidebar:

&gt;Follow us at \[]\(`http://twitter.com/`*mytwitteraccount*`)`

 3\. Note that this link will not be visible yet!     

 4\. Go to your subreddit's CSS editing page, upload the image here, and add this code:    

&gt; `/*Twitter Feed Graphic*/`    
&gt; `a[href=""http://twitter.com/`mytwitteraccount`""]:after {`    
&gt;   `  width: 68px;`    
&gt;   `  height: 16px;`    
&gt;   `  content: """";`    
&gt;   `  background-image: url(%%twitter%%);`    
&gt;   `  background-position: -0px;`    
&gt;   `  display: inline-block;`    
&gt;   `  cursor: default`    
&gt;   `  }`      

 5\. Remember to replace ""mytwitteraccount"" with your **actual** twitter account.

***

You should now be done!

###Bonus Tip

If you ""follow"" some celebrities related to your topic, it may help attract people to your twitter account and your subreddit.

Here's where the situation becomes unclear.  The user, before getting banned, was a high profile, helpful member of the community who created a post, on Reddit, which was later clipped to the sidebar as part of a FAQ.

Now that the user is banned, he's suddenly demanding that we remove that reddit post, and link from our sidebar to it, or he'll smack us with a DMCA takedown notice.

After not getting a response within 30 or so mins, regardless of timezones involved, he's then gone and pm'ed us some official worded paragraphs which could, conceivably, be a DMCA takedown notice.

My situation and request is, in a nutshell the following... speaking as a fellow mod of /microgrowery, I'd like to know if I can tell this former user to basically go and fuck himself?

I don't wanna piss off my co-mod or get SRD involved or anything. I'm sure someone out there will probably guess the sub I mod based on my description though. Whatever.

I mod a sub with around 30,000 subscribers. I am having trouble moderating my sub because I have very little experience in moderating, and am seeing my moderation style becoming a little too totalitarian. I want to trust the community to moderate itself, but many of the submissions coming in don't really apply to the real purpose of the sub. I think that maybe I'm not explaining the purpose of the sub very well, and I have too many rules. 

The sub continues to grow and grow, and there's some good submissions in there, but a lot of it is irrelevant. It seems like half of the subscribers want the sub to be about a certain kind of video, and the other half want it to be a place for their favorite funny viral videos and clips from TV sitcoms. I'm having a lot of trouble communicating what the group is about and convincing subscribers who want to make it about whatever they want.

Mod posts largely go unnoticed or are downvoted to hell. I was getting feedback a few months ago, but lately when I ask subscribers for their feedback, I can hear crickets chirping. There's a lot of dissatisfaction over videos being removed for being against the rules or otherwise irrelevant.

I have a co-mod who is not as hands-on as I am, and I gather that they also don't have a lot of experience. We often butt-heads over banning users and such.

There were still 74 subscribers to the subreddit, because the LSAT is of *intense* interest to anyone writing. 

I was given control on May 27th. There are now 163 subscribers. I'm pretty pleased with progress so far, and wanted to share how I did it. 

I should not that I'm an LSAT tutor - having expertise in the area helped me attract users and talk to mods of related subreddits.

###First Steps - Messaging Active Users
----

I made a [quick announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/u7ofm/announcement_rlsat_has_a_new_mod/) as soon as a I took over. Then I looked through the 12 threads on /r/LSAT to see who had posted within the past two months. They were likely still studying for the LSAT.

I sent an individual, personalized message to each person who posted. Responses were favorable, and subscriptions edged upwards.

###Step 2: AMA
----

Once things got going, I did an [AMA thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/u9ht0/im_the_mod_of_rlsat_ama/). 

I did a [separate AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/u9hy1/im_the_mod_of_rlsat_ama_xpost_from_rlsat/) on /r/lawschool. Since there was no active LSAT forum, a lot of LSAT takers were active there. 

These posts attracted a lot of comments, upvotes and subscribers. Meanwhile, I kept adding useful posts to the sidebar, and commenting on every submission that was made. 

I set up a rss feed with metareddit's monitor. Whenever I saw an LSAT question posted elsewhere on reddit, I reached out. 

As a result of my AMA on /r/lawschool, the mods added /r/LSAT to the sidebar. That helped. 

###Step #: Share Good content
----

I wrote a guide to LSAT reading comprehension that was well received. So I [x-posted it to /r/lawschool.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/uf0uq/guide_to_lsat_reading_comprehension_xpost_from/) I had previously gotten the ok from a mod there. Gained about ten subscribers pretty quickly. 

I also [cross posted that guide](http://www.top-law-schools.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=185875) to a relevant forum, and attracted a few new users to reddit.

###Step 4: Reaching Beyond Reddit
----

I've been in touch with a few people who write LSAT Blog posts. So I contact them this week to let them know I was starting /r/LSAT up again, and invited them to participate. A few have come by, and they've forwarded me some of their best blog posts to include in some of the sidebar articles I'll be writing. 

Meanwhile, I've told my offline LSAT students that they're free to post any questions they have in /r/LSAT. I'll answer them to encourage activity.

###Results
----

I'm pretty happy with getting 89 new subscribers in a week. And there's a good level of activity. There were three user submissions today, and about 9 comments. That's been pretty typical.

As the subreddit grows, I'll contact the mods at /r/law to see if they're interested in a sidebar link. I'll also be promoting the subreddit periodically in LSAT forums.

I basically plan to be hyper-active while this gets off the ground. Once it grows large enough it should be self-sustaining, and I can take a back-seat role.

The most useful tips so far have been:

* Use metareddit
* Reach out to users and encourage activity
* identify other relevant subreddits, get in touch with the mods and start discussions there.
* Ask modhelp for advice. This place has been a great resource.
* Produce good content to keep people interested.
* Comment everywhere to encourage activity. If someone posts a good comment, upvote them and/or tell them you liked their comment.
* Be polite, and get in touch with other mods. Link to their subreddits on your sidebar.

People will always see your sidebar when they browse a submission of your subreddit. Make it good !

It will also be the text displayed after a [search ](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/search?q=jazz). The first line's better to be precise and spot on.

Most of the sidebars have some or all of this elements, often in this order :

 * A tagline : a short sentence defining the whole subject of your subreddit :
**""Long overdue sub-reddit for the heavy, heavy sound once produced from rainy, rainy Seattle many years ago.""** for [r/grunge](http://www.reddit.com/r/grunge)
 * A reddit's sidebar/description is going to be the main way that most people choose to add a subreddit. Include synonyms and related terms in it. An extremely brief description is very unhelpful.
 * Some notable and worthy posts, to be used as a FAQ e:g: [""Essential album"", ""Early jazz thread"" in /r/jazz](/r/jazz). This is a strong community builder.
 * Maybe some guidelines, if you want your subreddit heavy moderated. (no pics, only questions...)
 * A ""Community"" or ""Tool box"" (""Important links"") section: a FAQ, an irc chat, rage maker, official website, it all depends on your subreddit.
 * Eventually some [flair information](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/)
 * And finally, some related subreddits, particularly useful is people post often wrongly in your subreddit instead of another more related. (e.g rage_comics instead of pics). Or even some unrelated subreddit, just like that. 

But really, putting just a little description and some related subs is often enough. Pick what you need. Don't cluter it, people won't read it. Link to a self post in your subreddit, if you need to be verbose.

[Learn to use the titles, bullet points.](http://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/) They make the difference !

A nice list is so much more readable.

    ##Tagline

I was hoping people could give feedback or tell me that something like this will never happen or something I don't know, but here is the exact post as it appears over there.

I'm not really sure how often Admins come in here and look at the ideas but here goes.

I'm a moderator of /r/adviceanimals sometimes there are people who report everything they can. [Here](http://imgur.com/BNnE6)  is a screen shot from 3 days ago of our front page. And there were many more reports too, that's just 1 page. This can get really annoying really fast for the moderators, so here are some suggestions to improve the report feature:

1. Allow the moderators to see the names of the people reporting links so that if someone is reporting everything we can give them a warning/ ban them if necessary. Or maybe add a feature that allows moderators to take away a users privilege to report.

2. Set a limit for reports made in X-amount of time. Just throwing out random numbers here, but for example : Allow each account 5 reports every 1-2 hours.

3. Don't allow new users to report. This will help stop people making accounts to just troll the mods with reports.

4. In the 'Reported Links' tool for moderators, put an 'approve all' button to save some time. I know that this would defeat the purpose of the report button, but if a link really needs to be reported then chances are it will be reported again by someone else.

These are just a few ideas I was thinking about, they aren't all perfect and I'm sure there are better solutions to the problem. If you think of one please post it in the comments. Thanks for taking the time to read this and comment.

This was prompted by [bacongobbler posting in r/AskedReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/askedreddit) about users getting a trophy if they contribute a followup link.  I think this is a very clever way to encourage participation in the smaller subreddits.

In my subreddit, [r/ClassicalGuitar](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalGuitar) I've been giving out flair to people who post videos or audio of themselves playing.  It's been pretty effective at giving people a reason to contribute and something very attainable for anyone who is a participant in the community we're building.

For smaller subreddits with relatively low traffic, it's a pretty easy thing to do, and makes people feel special. Although I would hesitate to do something like this in r/pics.  ;-)

Another great use of flair in a subreddit I'm subscribed to is [r/Dallas's neighborhood flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas).  They're a really effective use of flair templates to allow users to pick their neighborhoods and give things more of a community feel.

I feel obligated to point out that I (personally) feel that [r/boardgames](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames) is a slightly less effective use of flair. Well, I take that back. They're really nicely done with the images, but limiting from the 1000's of boardgames out there and having to pick one of a handful to me doesn't do *as much* to encourage a community as some of the other mechanisms I've seen.

So... if you're trying to grow your subreddit, I bet you could steal a few of these techniques and/or message the appropriate mods and ask them how they've done some of these things if you want to try it for yourself.  

Any other techniques for helping out mod's, or really good uses of flair would be welcome to see in the comments!

I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Freethought/comments/99ukp/i_work_at_whole_foods_our_health_plan_is/) to the freethought subreddit. I submitted the article the same day it was published, before it became a contentious political issue. At that time, I viewed it as an independent perspective and some ideas that had not yet been considered on how to solve a problem and thus appropriate for the freethought subreddit. I also happen to work for John Mackey, and so I could contribute insight on the issue from a unique vantage point.

My submission received about 27 upvotes and 19 comments. Most of the dialogue was civil and engaging. It seemed like a somewhat productive submission to me. Not a front pager but a decent contribution.

6 days later, one of the moderators of the freethought subreddit [replied to one of my comments with an ad hominem calling me an idiot](http://www.reddit.com/r/Freethought/comments/99ukp/i_work_at_whole_foods_our_health_plan_is/c0c6dwe). The moderator also [commented that the submission was propaganda and concluded with the words ""banning imminent.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Freethought/comments/99ukp/i_work_at_whole_foods_our_health_plan_is/c0c6dvg)

Sure enough, it was. I received the following pm from the moderator shortly after:
&gt;**you've been banned**
&gt;
&gt;you have been banned from posting to Freethought: Scientific pursuit of the truth..

I am sure that moderator decisions are final, and so I'm not looking to appeal that. It's their playground, and they can run it how they like. I'm just wondering if this is the normal way that bans are handled. No warning, no explanation (or not much of one), just poof, you're banned.

My views may not line up with those of other redditors all the time, but I always make an effort to articulate my thoughts in a constructive, civil way that moves the conversation forward, even when there's disagreement. I take my share of ad hominems and flames (including one [redditor](http://www.reddit.com/user/xenomorph) regularly urging me to commit suicide), as I'm sure we all do. But it seems heavy-handed to wield the moderator stick to ban users you don't agree with (which is what this seems to be to me). Perhaps I'm just misunderstanding the purpose of the subreddit, or being too presumptuous about the moderator...

I would appreciate any feedback on whether this is how things work or if this really is not typical, as I suspect it isn't.

I mod a small music subreddit ( /r/House) and currently we have the downvote button hidden after a few of us took it over several months ago through a redditrequest, the other moderators were for this originally and I have been pretty firmly against it but mostly let them do their thing as they thought it was important.

I think the intention is good (not downvote music that people don't like or doesn't fit into the genre mold the way some think it should), but I don't think it is effective and does more harm than good. We have a small number of subscribers (6700), and I don't think it has run into huge issues due to the size but as it grows I really think hiding downvotes will just cripple the subreddit.

Can anyone give any better insight as to why hiding downvotes might be a good idea or a more technical explanation of why it doesn't work with the reddit voting algorithm? The thought process is that content will still be sorted by relevance based on what has more upvotes, but I feel like downvotes are an essential part of this and by hiding it then the front page just becomes a dump of everything submitted.

Anyone have experience of having downvotes hidden in a subreddit then choosing to unhide them or the other way around and how it worked? I'm hoping we can try unhiding them for a bit and see how it works but any more information about the issue would be helpful.

We have repeated problems with trolls trying to stir up flamewars between newsgroups.

I'm not going to identify the groups (except directly to reddit admins) but I am sure it is well known there are communities with natural distrust and antipathy between them. The subreddit I moderate, when even mentioned in the other subreddit, will *always* start a flamewar and incite that other newsgroup's members to troll our subreddit. 

Most of the regular contributors have been through these flamewars repeatedly, and they consider it one of our informal policies to not crosspost to that group, or even mention them, to not give that group any incitement to retaliate. 

But sometimes an ""agent provocateur"" comes in and deliberately tries to start mischief by crossposting something inflammatory to the other group. They'll find a post in our subreddit that is sure to cause a reaction, link to it in the other group, and say something to provoke them into flaming. Usually they do this from a one-shot throwaway account, never used again. It's a pretty obvious attempt to start trouble. And it usually works. 

I wish there was a way that as a moderator, I could prevent specific subreddits from posting links to our subreddit. This is probably technically difficult, and probably undesirable, it would lead to ""balkanization"" of reddit.

So what can I do in a situation like this? I usually ban the provocateur and delete all his messages. The ban sends a message notifying the provocateur of the ban, and usually I get an obscenity-laden response like this:

&gt;I'll get this reversed. I am 1. Going to make a ----ton of throwaways. 2. Tell your mom tonight, while I'm ------- her, that she should tell you to let me post.

Now I'm well aware that most trolls don't follow through, but the most demented, determined ones *do* create dozens of disposable accounts and use them to cause considerable trouble. And we mods have no tools to deal with griefers. We can't even ban them without causing a notification to be sent, which provokes them even more. All we can do is clean up after the damage is done. Eventually things settle down. And then some provocateur will start the cycle again, and crosspost a provocation to another subreddit. 

Any suggestions for dealing with this ongoing problem?",,False,,t5_2qy7w,False,,,True,t3_i92wp,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/i92wp/dealing_with_trolls_and_griefers_as_agent/,

My personal feeling is this.

For example someone is asking for help that a specific soap could help with and the owner of the business posts a reply like ""hey, I have something that might help - check out my website.

Full out submissions are advertising and should be paid for. Exception is if they are already a paying advertiser.

I do NOT and will NEVER solicit a business for a ""reddit"" discount. But I've got a few members who are interested in doing so. This one is my current sticking point.

Hey,

Over at /r/gamedeals, our top priority is the safety of our users. Many of the games today require keys that activate a product on a services' account(steam, origin, etc.). Due to the nature of these accounts, it is possible for a user to be banned by the service and lose access to all of their games. It is largely unclear what actions will cause a user to violate the terms of service for these services. Because of the immense responsibility the we feel for our users, /r/gamedeals tries to provide as safe of an environment as possible. 

One of the ways we attempt to help our users safely purchase games is by removing all links to CD Key resellers. I would classify games sellers in two categories: white market and grey market. We attempt to deal in only white market keys. That is, keys that are bought directly from the publisher and resold by legitimate retailers like amazon, greenmangaming, getgamesgo, steam, etc. We attempt to remove grey market keys. That is, keys whose origin are largely unknown. Grey market keys are usually sold significantly below market value and are come from dubious sources. It is not uncommon for these keys to be stolen or purchased in regions where the price is significantly lower. Stolen or keys from other regions can result in the game being removed from your account, or in extreme cases, your account being closed. I also fear that some of these sites may not deliver the product that a customer purchased or may do nefarious things with their credit information.

To circumvent the rules of our subreddit, kinguin.net has purchased a sponsored link. We have removed links submitted to /r/gamedeals from this site multiple times in the past and have made it clear that links to the site are not allowed on the subreddit.   

I'm not going to sit here and tell the admins how to monetize their site. I only ask that you review the kinguin.net again and determine if it is something that is appropriate for the users of reddit.

Thanks,

-Adam and the rest of the /r/gamedeals moderation team

The character limit says it's ""5120 max"" which we seem to regularly exceed, meaning we have to optimize the sidebar as much as possible.

I ran the entirety of the sidebar through Word to count the characters and it returned far fewer characters than I expected since the sub-reddit says we've exceeded the 5,120 character limit.

1. Is the max character limit number correct? If not, what is it?

Recent [changes](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/qksll/moderators_remove_linkscomments_without_training/) allow moderators to either remove a post/comment (currently called ""dismiss"" or ""remove"") or remove with *prejudice* (""spam"").

Based on some feedback from /u/Kylde (anti-spam crusader) and /u/bsimpson (a reddit admin), I've fixed the script and set it to use spam=false in the modqueue. This is intended to prevent over-training of the filter -- if spam is in the modqueue, the filter is doing something right.

Since the script will also trigger on the about/reports and about/spam pages...

* The spam page doesn't have *either* type of removal button. If I remember correctly, the script is active here solely to put ""autoban"" buttons next to confirmed spam posts. I'm a little leery of having the script active on this page, just in case markup changes. **Proposal: Deactivate script for about/spam page.**
* The about/reports page has both ""remove"" and ""spam"" buttons. **Question: Should the script continue to train the spamfilter on reported-but-not-filtered items?**

I run a location-based community and am confronted with ""classifieds"" posts from users. I cannot decide whether to call this spam or not.


There have been legitimate businesses that attempted to make posts before, but I removed the posts since (let me know if you disagree) they can buy ad space if they want to hock their products or services.


However, classifieds-style posting feels like a different game. These are literally local people in a local Reddit community letting other people know of something they have to sell.


My thoughts are sort of as follows:

- These people are basically posting an ad... there are services like Kijiji, eBay, etc. to get this job done already. This leads me to believe that I should flag the post.

- Posts of this nature are more personal in a location-based community and might fly as actual conversation on top of someone getting their shout out. Leave the post as a result?

I am curious if anyone else faces decisions on similar posts.

He was a redditor for 4 years.  He posted links from his blogs (I do not know what his comment karma was); and was aware of the rules, but thought that the relevant part was here, from the FAQ.

He had 21K link karma, so I'd think he was on safe ground; or at least would be deserving of a warning before banning; or an explanation, after banning.  None of that happened. 

The problems: 

1) I can't tell if he's been system-wide banned, or just subreddit banned; but the fact that I can't see his /user/Aravosis page indicates that he's system-wide banned. 

2) If he's system-wide banned, who would respond to his question about why?  Hueypriest? 

3) If he was banned due to mod action in the two subreddits, could those mods speak up as to why, at least to the user?

Also: his blog writer ""Gaius Publius"" was banned *almost* simultaneously, also without warning.  The concern here is that he and the blog are being targeted through reddit mods for political reasons.

Almost always, players have numbers under 30, since that's one of the team's rules. Management just likes it that way. But, we just signed a player that's a definite Hall of Famer once he retires, and who has worn the number 68 his entire career, so there's a chance he might be allowed to wear a number above 35, which has happened only a few times in the history of the club.

The problem is, I only created flair for the home, away, and retro jerseys featuring number 1 to 35, as well as 40, 44, 88, 89, and 93, which are the five numbers above 35 that have been worn in club history. If this new player (Jaromir Jagr) wears #68, we won't have it as a flair option. Updating flair is easy enough, but when you do it, it breaks the current flair for everyone else.

For a couple examples:

* [Here's a thread asking for restaurant recommendations.](http://www.reddit.com/r/amarillo/comments/1feib0/where_can_i_get_a_good_steak_in_this_town_the/) I expect the root-level comment on the bottom to have its fair share, but everything else posted within a day of the thread's start has 1-3 downvotes, where on another subreddit I wouldn't expect that.

I realized earlier today that there's no great place on reddit to contain the endless amount of tech debates that happen across all subreddits. Now, debating in individual subreddits is fine, but if I try to bring my positive opinions on my Nexus 7 into /r/iPad, I'm going to be outnumbered and downvoted. When I tell people on /r/Surface how much I love my Macbook Pro, people will shit all over me. Subreddits that focus on individual products tend to be biased, and there seems to be no neutral playground for users to debate each other in a civil, yet passionate environment.

**Enter /r/TechWars**

The goal of /r/TechWars is to provide a platform for discussion between tech products. This includes (but is not limited to):

* Hardware devices; like computers, tablets, individual parts, etc.
* Software; like operating systems, individual applications, Android vs iOS, etc.
* Gaming devices; 3DS vs Vita, PS3 vs 360, etc.
* Miscellaneous tech; cars, watches, 
* Tech concepts; battery technology, modern water filtration systems, cleaning game carts with alcohol vs blowing in them
* Services; ""Netflix is better than Amazon Instant Video. Here's why.""

My end goal is to have /r/TechWars be a go-to place whenever someone wants to have an honest debate about tech. But try to check your biases at the door!

**What I'm currently looking for:**

I need a small handful of mods (maybe 2 or 3?) that are *super* into technology, and preferably have devices and experience across an incredibly wide range of products and services. These mods should carry no bias one way or the other for any particular company, and should have the ability to judge products purely on their individual merit. It's also a plus if they own a gigantic number of tech devices. :)

I'm also looking for one person to help out with the CSS of the subreddit. I don't really have anything in mind at the moment, but I'd like it to look pretty sweet.

Add another subscription for the moderator messages RSS feed. Now one last thing, you need to change how often it checks for new messages. Click on the account in the sidebar again, then click ""View settings for this account"". Under Server Settings, change the ""Check for new articles every"" to however often you want.

Does anyone know the timeframe on getting the new wiki system implemented? It was announced a few months ago, but I haven't been able to find much in the way of updates since then. It would be really nice to be able to use this soon, as we're running out of space on our sidebar.

There are a couple of users who post (one regularly, one occasionally) on a subreddit of which I am a moderator who appear to have been shadowbanned (their posts go straight to the spam filter, their user pages come up not found, /about.json still shows up, etc.). When this first came up, the decision was made that unless any given comment violated the subreddit's (or reddit's) rules, it should be approved - although an argument was made that shadowbanned users were probably shadowbanned for a reason, and perhaps should just be left alone.

Recently there have been people questioning this and stating that in essence approving the comments of shadowbanned users subverts the will of the site's administrators and negates the punishment given. However, it has also been suggested that if the admins didn't want subreddits' moderators to have the opportunity to approve shadowbanned users' posts, it would be fairly trivial to prevent that from happening.

So ultimately, I guess I have a couple of questions:

1. Does anyone have any knowledge regarding official policy on this subject?

2. Barring that, what do you all do? Does anyone else have a similar policy of approving comments that don't violate rules? Or is that completely unheard of?",,False,,t5_2qy7w,False,,,True,t3_y4294,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/y4294/question_regarding_how_other_subreddits_deal_with/,

We just want to be able to have the control to get rid of these people who can potentially kill someone by inciting them to kill themselves.

1310415950.0,10,self.modhelp,imq05,Additional ways to view deleted/removed submissions?,10,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/imq05/additional_ways_to_view_deletedremoved_submissions/,"I've been running into a few issues recently with some users being sneaky with their spamming methods, so I'm hoping that someone out there knows some ways to see deleted or mod-removed submissions that I'm not aware of. Currently, gathering a history is practically impossible if the spammers use these tricks.

I won't get into any specifics for domains/users, but there are two cases that are difficult:

1. Users deleting their submissions. There are a few people that spam by submitting something, getting a bit of attention to it, and then if it's not going anywhere, they delete it and submit it again. Some of them will repeat this quite a few times over a short period. You can see the history of this happening if you check the domain's ""new"" page (like http://www.reddit.com/domain/example.com/new), where deleted submissions show up. But if they're doing it for something that's hosted on a very commonly-submitted domain (youtube is the worst offender), it's almost impossible to find their history. This is also something that's very difficult to notice, unless you witness them doing it. I don't usually look at a domain's new page as part of a regular ""is this guy a spammer?"" check.
2. Mods removing spam, but the users using multiple accounts to spam the same domain. There are some spammers that will only submit their domain a few times from a particular account, then create a new one, and start spamming the same domain from the new one. It's very difficult to form an overall picture of this behavior, because each user's history only shows a few submissions, and mod-removed submissions don't show up on either the search page or the domain page.

These difficulties are both linked to the limited places that you can see the different types of submissions that have been removed. As far as I know, submissions deleted by the user can only be seen on the domain's new page, and submissions removed by mods can only be seen either on the user's page, or the subreddit's spam page.

It wouldn't be that big of a deal in most reddits but as you can see it could literally mean life or death in r/assistance. 

Here is a post made today. Every comment has been removed yet people report they can still see them. What is going and is there anything I can do about it?

Now though, all the posts I make using the dummy account appear only on New, and tend to stay stranded there on zero upvotes as nobody checks New. I imagine this is because we are a low volume subreddit, the new page and the hot page are almost identical.

",17,8,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/yq8we/i_became_mod_of_a_dead_subreddit_about_a_year_ago/,"(sorry for making another post, but this also ties into my other one... and of course self posts means no karma.) 

So about a year ago, /r/ucla had about 600 people, with 3 moderators. The subreddit was barely alive, and it didn't look like anyone was trying to do anything to change it, so I asked to become moderator. From there, with the help of some users, I helped win the Grow a College Subreddit Competition. I garnered 1000+ users, and now I have an active, flourishing subreddit of 2,600 subscribers, with a great IRL community as well. I held our only successful meetups. 

The thing is, I had zero help from the other mods. I know they are busy, but I have been the only mod to post and be apart of the community for a year, and I need some new mods. A few months ago, one mod came in and tried to implement a change without consulting the others (where one of the contingencies of me being a mod was that 2 other mods need to agree) or any of our users. It was not received well by me, but more importantly our users. One simply replied ""no,"" and was the top comment.

They don't see the other mods as mods anymore, nor will they respect their authority. Users don't even use modmail for help anymore - they message me directly because I have been the only active one. I'm afraid of our mod team seeming authoritative, since we have 3 enigmatic mods who never post but only moderate (if that.)

There are many changes that I would like to implement on my own, but I would still like more moderation input from people who actually participate. Also, when I was modded, I agreed that I would not make any decisions on my own. Well, to put it bluntly, I don't think the other mods should have a say in the changes i'd like to implement. It's no question that i've done more for the community than any of the other mods (combined), and I know what and who our subreddit needs. I also work closely with our users and know many of them personally, so I wouldn't trust the other mod opinion anyway. None of the other mods have been to a meetup.

I don't mean it to sound like i'm shit talking them, because I know they're busy and might have better commitments. So, is there anyway I'm able to clear the inactive mods and get new ones (and also become head mod)? I'm not even sure they're active on reddit anymore, but certainly not checking in on our sub. I have a few people in mind that I would like to have on my team, but I want to be sure that I have the sole authority before I add anyone so I don't undermine others'.  

**tl;dr** I asked to be a moderator of a dead subreddit, and revived the community garnering 2000+ subscribers since then. Over the past year, I've gotten to know my users online and IRL and I have been the only active mod (out of 4) to the point where users PM me directly instead of using Modmail. I want to replace our 3 inactive mods with more useful people and implement many changes but don't have the authority.

I love that you can assign spam easily now under the newer system, It's great that you can report and remove spam in one fell swoop.

We were assured that it would still be trainable, and I have been on this like white on rice for months and nothing seems to be improving. Now with the addition of the ""unmoderated links"" (which don't get me wrong, I adore!), it's becoming rather overwhelming to go through things that are missing requirements and remove them.

I also considered just hiding the ""Official"" flair from the flair selector via CSS, but then mods would have to disable CSS to apply it, and users could circumvent it in exactly the same way. At best it's too complicated, and at worst just as exploitable as having the flair out in the open.

The other option is just to lock down flair again and have mods tag all the spoiler posts manually.

The code below should work just fine.  

I figured out how to get flair text to have certain colors.  I thought it might be helpful if any of you are struggling with it.  Below, replace all words in CAPS with whatever you find relevant. 

1. go to your style sheet: http://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/about/stylesheet 

2. in the text box, create a CSS class like this: 

      .flair-CLASS {
        background:BACKGROUND_COLOR !important;
        color:TEXT_COLOR !important
        }

    On choosing colors, you can use words (red, green, blue) or hex values (#FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF).  CLASS is just the word you will use to refer to the color setup you chose, any name you want.  Of course you can put other features into class, like a border and whatnot, but I kept it simple.

I see the first pic and ban trollpat's account immediately. I may also report to ASPCA, but that's a different rabbit hole.

Trollpat gets the 'you have been banned' notice and creates trollpat2 within 20 seconds.

Trollpat's new account, trollpat2 submits more pics of bloody murdered kittens.

Seeing this, I banned trollpat2's account and he creates another one (trollpat3) again within 20 or 30 seconds. and so on.

Instead of this, I could mark trollpat2's posts as spam, ""remove"" them with my admin tools, and allow trollpat2 to think his pics are being seen. This works for as long as trollpat2 doesn't search for his posts in the queue - which admittedly may not be very long at all. - but may be longer than 20 seconds.   it also helps train the spam detection tool.

As I hear it, it simply makes the submitter’s name green and bold.

Well, [our subreddit](http://reddit.rhps.org) gets pushed out to a twitter feed. This morning I looked at the feed on a whim and noticed a post was made last night that I didn’t see on our subreddit's page. I clicked the link through twitter and it appears as if someone downvoted the submission so it was at zero and thus gone; pushed too far down for anyone else to take notice. 

Then the same thing happened to [my submission in pimpmyreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/pimpmyreddit/comments/gaiuw/rrhps_for_anyone_interested_in_the_cult_classic/) this morning.

Now we have a small, niche subreddit, so I can’t imagine a reason anyone would want to downvote, well, anything in there. My thought is that if you've bothered to seek us out and subscribe, you’re probably interested in most of the submissions. So to me, this just seemed unfair to the guy who posted it.

So I was thinking that perhaps the distinguish button could also force a submission to not drop below 1 upvote. That way at the very least it gets a fighting chance to get some eyeballs on it, and since only a mod can distinguish a post (right?) then it doesnt seem like it would be abused. And if the post sucks, then well, it’ll stay at one no matter how many downvotes and we move on.

&gt;Your submission [The Beards - You Should Consider Having Sex With a Bearded Man](http://www.reddit.com/r/upliftingmusic/comments/11sbwb/the_beards_you_should_consider_having_sex_with_a/) was caught by Reddit's overzealous spam filter. It has now been set free, and has automatically been moved to the top of r/UpliftingMusic's ""[new](http://www.reddit.com/r/upliftingmusic/new)"" page.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, because it sat in the spam filter for so long, its ""hot"" ranking (an algorithm that determines where on the front page a submission appears based on number of upvotes over time) has been unfairly penalized. This is unavoidable due to the way Reddit is coded, so if you wish to, feel free to delete the submission and resubmit it so it can have a fighting chance!

First time moding here, and a little newbiwe with CSS...so for starters i just wanted to put the header background color white, so in the stylesheet editor, i clicked to see the default stylesheet, copied the entire sucker to my notepad++, backit-up, changed:

    ...
    #header-bottom-left {
     font-size:larger;
     background-color:#FFFFFF;/*  added background color */ 
    }
    ...

when previewing or saving i get:

**too big. keep it under 100kb**

This is probably because the css im loading is 115kb :P

I run a music subreddit. When I started out the spam filter seemed to flag a lot of new posts as spam and I had to manually approve them. My understanding is that over time the spam filter becomes ""trained"" (I've also been adding users who have a reputation of sending good links to the approved list..)

However the issue I think I'm having now as the subreddit grows (a couple thousand subscribers now) is that people are reporting links because they don't like the band or the song, not because the post is actually spam. 

The rule for my subreddit is that all posts that can be perceived as related in any way are acceptable and the community votes if they like the song or not. I don't like it when users report links and I don't notice it for 2-3 days later and the song loses its chance of receiving attention because of one guy..

My Questions:

How do I know if a link is being caught by the spam filter or if someone is reporting it? also is it possible to know who are reporting links? (or is this purposefully left anonymouse)

Are there any further steps I can take to stop this from happening? for instance to automatically approve common domains like youtube.com or soundcloud.com where legitimate links are often posted to..?

I imagine there is some css I can use to hide the report link.. but I figure trolls know how to circumvent that.....

How can one get away after freely and publicly insulting almost everyone in reddit while doing the same thing in his subs?

___

He's been PM flooding thousands of redditors and approves them to join (anythinggoes network) his war against the big subreddits.
If you want a proof, just search ""approved"" in each of his anythinggoes* subs.

I think this ban is not fair and now Mind_Virus is playing the swagger and threatens redditors who are calling out his reposts.
http://i.imgur.com/5xUrR.png

The fact is that with or without me calling him out, more and more redditors are starting to hate his pathetic attitude (check all his self-deleted posts/comments to protect his karma points).

If you haven't checked already, you can take a look at my history and you'll see that I'm not only calling karma whores out, but also participate in spam reporting (I've learned a lot from Kylde and more than a year ago, If you can remember, I reported and helped to take down an entire network of spammers who were bribing people with reddit gold).

I hope you'll reconsider this ban and let me continue to participate in this reddit adventure.

1336666898.0,9,self.modhelp,tgnn2,Moderator Rankings?,9,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/tgnn2/moderator_rankings/,"Hey,

I operate a subreddit, /r/Playdate, that has had a few iterations of moderators. Throughout the iterations a couple of users stayed on but aren't active, and the third (?) iteration is active and doing well. However, that iteration of mods is lowest on the ladder, as in the ""edit moderators"" page we're unable to remove any of the long-time users.

This is a problem because there's one long-time user who was a bot but now has no purpose, and we were trying to remove it but were unable to do so. I've contacted one of the inactive long-time user who will probably respond eventually and solve the situation. But, it still leaves me perplexed, so here's the important part:

---

I understand why the subreddit founder cannot be removed, so the lead moderator always has control. However, I don't understand why the rest of the moderators have varying levels of permissions.

There are eight moderators, four of which are active (we'll call it set B) and a part of the current iteration. None of these moderators have authority over the other four moderators (we'll call it set A). The top four has authority over the bottom four.

The weird part is that *one* of the moderators from set A could actually be considered set A/B, as he doesn't have authority over the other moderators from set A, but *has* authority over the moderators from set B. And actually, the subreddit founder should have authority over all, so...

... in reality there are seemingly FOUR tiers:

- Tier 1: Subreddit founder, nobody may remove
- Tier 2: Set A, consisting of 2 mods, may be only removed by Tier 1
- Tier 3: Set A/B, consisting of 1 mod, may be removed by Tier 1 &amp; 2
- Tier 4: Set B, consisting of 4 mods, may be removed by Tier 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3

(this may not be 100% accurate with our mods but for ease of explanation I'll leave it)

Okay, so with that said I have a working theory that the authority of moderators depends on who appointed them. If the subreddit founder appointed Tier 2, and Tier 2 appointed Tier 3, and Tier 3 appointed Tier 4, then it would make sense. My questions, thus:

1. Is my working theory accurate?
2. Tier 4, which are the actually active mods, should definitely not be in the lowest tier. How can this system be reset or modified to move the all mods into the same tier, Tier 2?

Hope this made sense. If not, let me know and I'll try to explain it better. THANKS!",,False,,t5_2qy7w,False,,,True,t3_tgnn2,http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/tgnn2/moderator_rankings/,

Second question: I set up a simple feedback system for the users of [/r/yugioh](/r/yugioh) to have a better experience trading cards. I had a report of a person making new reddit accounts and repeatedly ripping people off by not sending cards. 

The person who reported it to me included the address of this scammer, and I decided to use the system implemented by pojo.biz. This means I only display the city, state (if applicable) and ZIP publicly and require users to PM me if they wish to see if an address matches a known scammer's address.

Ultimately, the only sharing of personal information is the person who has been scammed sending the scammer's address to me.

I was just wanting to know if there would be any interest amongst other moderators of different subreddits for an idea I was thinking of just there. Someone may have already suggested it but I don't know if it's in the works or anything.

I was thinking that maybe having an archive option in the mod mail could be useful. So y'know, you can go back to view the messages of a certain month or date easily without trawling through lots of mail.

Another idea I was thinking was having like a ""other discussions"" type tab on messages. So if a user sends a message as a follow up to something they've sent previously in a different message or if you want to check messages they've send before - abusive, complaining, suggestions etc - then there would be like a tab somewhere in the message options to view other messages they'd sent before.

It goofs up our tournament. So I often wind up deleting and removing the downvoted posts and reposting them so our readers can see it.

Because I screwed up one of the rounds a week or two ago, the subreddit now has me flagged to auto-remove everything I post. Since I post almost everything in the subreddit for the Tournament, that's a problem. How do I fix it? I already made myself an approved submitter, but it hasn't helped.

I just recently opened up /r/randomactsofkindness.  It's a place where people are free to request and offer cards to send a little happiness around the world.  There's a sidebar of rules and a [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/1atdc6/faq_page/) page up for all to read.  

I don't have a cap on the number of cards people can ask for, but I do say to leave some for others or pay it forward.  I'm working under the assumption that people will use their good judgment.  Also they're cards.  Fun to get something in the mail and it's a nice thing, but cards aren't really worth money.  So I didn't think it'd hold much appeal to ask for more than one or two.  (Barring things like asking for many get well cards for someone, for example.)  

However I've been flipping through posts and comments (to make sure things are running smoothly, if anyone has questions, etc.) and I'm noticing that a couple of people are commenting on a lot of different offer posts for a card and then getting them (because who would check into their background beforehand and say, ""Oh.  I see you've already asked for more than two cards.""?).  I didn't notice at first because sometimes comments or posts would get deleted.

I don't want to police people and say they're asking for too many cards because I think that isn't a good tone for the community.  Plus I do not have that kind of time or energy to commit to that.  However it doesn't really sit right with me even though they're not breaking the rules.  I guess I'm just a touch disappointed.  

I'm just wondering how other subreddits that deal with random acts of kindness deal with people who are taking more than their fair share of things for themselves.  Is it a concern?  Did you modify your rules?  Did you let it go and hope it evens itself out? Is this something I should worry over? I'm I just being too paranoid?  

This is my first time modding something and it's a community that I built up and worked really hard to get it off the ground.  I want to make sure I do it right with little to no drama to be a good mod that's there if needed, but largely stays out of things unless it's to remind someone of the rules.  (Mostly I shoot PMs about why their post was taken down because they didn't follow the sidebar.)  

I've read the mod rules and redditiquette, but it'd be useful to get some advice from other mods.  Or gain a little bit more perspective.  :)

I'm co-modding a new small subreddit which is self-post only. We seem to have a surprisingly high number of posts get caught in the spam filter - as many as one in four. 

None of these are bad or inappropriate posts for our subreddit: they are all good posts caught by a bad spam filter.

Looking at the moderation log, some of us are marking these as not spam, and some of us are confirming them as ham. I'm worried that we're somehow teaching the spam filter to remove these posts, when that's not our intention.

What *should* we be doing to teach the spam filter to accept these in future? Confirm them as ham? Mark them as not spam? The spam filter is a mysterious and wilful creature. How do we train it right?

Hey,

I'm not sure how many people use the check reddit modqueue(henceforth CRM) script, but I always see it linked in collections of mod tools. For me, it has been broken for a while now. It has had a large blank space to the left of it where an image was once displayed. I'm guessing reddit move the image around in their sprite sheet and that caused the script to display nothing.

I never liked the image, though. I liked the number of how many items were in your modqueue. I figured since the script was being installed with just a google hits, that there may be a market for an updated script.

Let me know if there are any bugs.
-Adam

I also made these, with the image:

&gt;http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/154530

&gt;For this, the image width is set to 14. The image is close to the number.

&gt;http://imgur.com/a/qxqVS#0

and 


&gt;http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/154528

&gt;For this, the image has a width of 18. Wider than the actual image so there is a little more space between the image and the number.

&gt;http://imgur.com/a/qxqVS#1


And 

&gt;this is without the image: 

&gt;http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/154385

&gt;http://imgur.com/a/qxqVS#2


It isn't perfect. If you'd like the image to be grey when you have no modqueue items and light up red when you do, I'd suggest [this script by roguedarkjedi](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/k1l8b/introducing_reddit_spam_notifier_notifies_you_on/). It was last updated 3 months ago. I don't know whether it still works.

I also don't know how to get rid of the number for the people that would only like the image.

The only other problem I see is that ""my"" script is pulling the image from: http://www.redditstatic.com/sprite-reddit.GyUPD65ihNY.png. Now, it might just me, but that looks like an image name that is going to change. I'm guessing they're going to update that image at some point and my script will break. If that happen, message me.

Not to get drunk with power (that's why I have a cat) but to try and contribute to a community that I care about, and because I think it may be relevant to my career. My questions are:

1: Might it actually be relevant to my career? I'm in management with a technical background, but I guess what I'm asking is do the nuts and bolts of moderation come down to decision making, communication and persuasion/consensus-building, or is it more technical and codey (codish?)? I don't know CSS and haven't touched HTML in a few years, but if that's the smaller part of the role I would gladly learn it to put the other aspects within my grasp.

2: Is there any sort of roadmap to becoming a mod? I could just start an obscure Reddit for the purposes of sandboxing, but that seems like a terrible reason to start a new sub. If there's a ""laundry list"" that you recommend before requesting mod status I would love to get my hands on it. Alternatively, is it bad form to ask another mod to show me the ropes? I am unaware of any intermediate steps between subscriber and mod and I know asking for mod status just to get my feet wet is not likely to be received well. I guess if that's the route I'm to take, I'd be well-served to try and distinguish myself as a poster/commenter first on one of the smaller Reddits to which I subscribe and then discuss with the mods there?

Have a peek over there. The poor subreddit is drowned out by students asking questions. Not a particularly terrible thing as it means the subreddit is useful to many students. Many of the questions aren't really unique and we hope to use a new FAQ to answer many of the common questions.

But is there any particular ways to sort of ""force"" quality discussion and submissions? I'm thinking similar to /r/fitness's method of combating ""dumb questions"" with moronic monday where they try to get all of the dumb questions out of the way in a single day, while still allowing people to ask ""dumb"" questions.

Is there any good way to encourage a culture that rewards discussion and upvoting links to blogs/news/etc?

I have created a wiki page for a subreddit I mod for.  The subreddit is /r/flytying and the link to the FAQ is on [this link](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/flytying). 

[On the stylesheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/flytying/stylesheet) you will be able to see I have created a header, which is currently blank (content section).  I copied this from /r/ps3bf3.

How can I put a link to the FAQ in the content part of the header?  I am wanting to say something like  ""click here to learn the methods for creating the fly of the week""  and link to  http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/flytying
