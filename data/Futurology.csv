I am Luke Muehlhauser (""Mel-howz-er""), CEO of the [Singularity Institute](http://singularity.org/). I'm excited to do an AMA for the /r/Futurology community and would like to thank you all in advance for all your questions and comments. (Our connection is more direct than you might think; the header image for /r/Futurology is one I personally threw together for the cover of my ebook *[Facing the Singularity](http://facingthesingularity.com/)* before I paid an artist to create [a new cover image](http://facingthesingularity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/finalv02.png).)

The Singularity Institute, founded by [Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://yudkowsky.net/) in 2000, is the largest organization dedicated to making sure that smarter-than-human AI has a positive, safe, and ""[friendly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence)"" impact on society. (AIs are made of math, so we're basically a math research institute plus an advocacy group.) I've written many things you may have read, including two [research](http://singularity.org/files/IE-EI.pdf) [papers](http://singularity.org/files/SaME.pdf), a [Singularity FAQ](http://singularity.org/singularity-faq/), and [dozens of articles](http://lukeprog.com/writings.html) on [cognitive neuroscience](http://lesswrong.com/lw/71x/a_crash_course_in_the_neuroscience_of_human/), [scientific self-help](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/), [computer science](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dhg/an_intuitive_explanation_of_solomonoff_induction/), [AI safety](http://lukeprog.com/SaveTheWorld.html), [technological forecasting](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9ao/longterm_technological_forecasting/), and [rationality](http://lesswrong.com/r/lesswrong/lw/7e5/the_cognitive_science_of_rationality/). (In fact, we at the Singularity Institute think human rationality is so important for *not screwing up the future* that we helped launch the [Center for Applied Rationality](http://appliedrationality.org/) (CFAR), which teaches [Kahneman-style rationality](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/) to students.)

On October 13-14th we're running our 7th annual [Singularity Summit](http://singularitysummit.com/) in San Francisco. If you're interested, [check out the site](http://singularitysummit.com/) and [register online](https://www.thinkreg.com/events/singularity/).

I've given online interviews before ([one](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8s6/video_qa_with_singularity_institute_executive/), [two](http://lesswrong.com/lw/980/singularity_institute_executive_director_qa_2/), [three](http://singularity.org/blog/2011/09/15/interview-with-new-singularity-institute-research-fellow-luke-muehlhuaser-september-2011/), [four](http://80000hours.org/blog/17-high-impact-interview-1-existential-risk-research-at-siai)), and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have!

Content here has been consistently intellectually stimulating, and has motivated me more than I would have believed possible.

There was a speech/video I remember watching a while ago about ""How we stopped dreaming"", how we, as a culture, have forgotten or given up on large ""world of tomorrow"" goals and ideas. For me, and I would guess many of you, /r/Futurology has been more than another Popular Mechanics, it has provided the motivation for individuals to improve the world around us, reminded us that learning, attending school, and working should not just be a means to a larger paycheck.

/r/Futurology has been an amazing repository for ideas many of us haven't encountered before, and it shows in the numbers! Over the last few months this sub has had a huge influx of subscribers, who came here for the same exact reasons we all did, and this is fantastic, 

**BUT**

Unfortunately the growing user base has brought with it some less than desirable habits, such as glorifying people rather than their ideas, which is a problem, as ideas are what give us a window into the future and motivate us. They are what this sub is all about.

The [top post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1k9fcl/elon_musk_is_more_important_to_society_than_steve/) at the time of this writing is not futurology material. Posts like this have become increasingly common, and I've even seen a few pictures with someone's quote plastered all over it make it to the front page. This is not good.

We've seen subs go this way before, and it always ends in tears (or rather, memes). I encourage the Mods to strictly uphold the rules for posts, specifically the **keep submissions/content relevant** part. I do not intend this as criticism, as I have no way of knowing how many crap posts get screened by mods already. More importantly, us the subscribers have to do our part.

For example:

Yesterday the plans for the hyperloop came out and today the front page is filled with links about it. This ~~isn't ideal~~ is ok, since the links lead to real content (the .pdf) but it's not ideal.  The ideal way for us, the subscribers to deal with something like this is to determine which of the posted links is the most reliable, the most content heavy, and upvote *just that one*, while leaving the other ones. The significantly less than ideal way to go about this is making meta posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1k9nlt/hey_guys_have_you_heard_about_the_hyperloop/). This only contributes to the problem, it's not funny, it's not content, and it definitely doesn't fix anything.


Ladies and gentlemen I absolutely love this sub, and I would hate to see it go down the drain like so many others, like (to use an extreme example) /r/Atheism. I don't know how many of you remember this, but there was a time when you could actually have an interesting discussion on that sub without the whole place clamoring about memes, crazies, and ""neckbeards"".

/rant

/PSA

Please do your part.

**TL;DR** Read the sidebar and posting rules, Don't post/upvote memes/image macros, Don't make meta posts (yes, I can appreciate the irony, but please...), discuss ideas rather than people.

Edit: fixed grammar/formatting

Edit: If any moderators see this, your input would be greatly appreciated.

When they go to market with this technology (and they will, of course), I don't think they're going to be doing it as a modification to existing cars - they'll be building their own. Since they haven't started R&amp;D on building their own yet, they're naturally going to have to either partner with, or buy a car company.

I don't see partnering happening. All of the car companies have been avoiding the idea of driverless cars in favor of ""assisted driving"". They all have corporate cultures that believe that everyone will want to drive their own car once NOT driving your own car becomes an option. I think Google will want complete control over the company building their cars, so they can shift the corporate culture to suit its vision of the future. A half-assed commitment from their manufacturing partner could easily sink the whole venture.

So who will they buy? They've got about $50B cash on hand. Toyota, whose cars they've been using in their tests, is right out - the company is worth $162B, so Google couldn't even purchase a controlling interest. And why would they? Toyota's success and size is based on the old car sales model, and that simply won't translate to a successful driverless sales model.

Maybe they'll stick to something home-grown. GM is worth $37B, which Google could afford, but they're not exactly known as the most forward-looking car company. Ford is a bit better - their integration with smartphones has made them a darling of the tech press - but they're more expensive at $47B, completely draining Google's coffers.

There's one obvious choice: Tesla Motors. It'll cost Google a measly $4B; its cars are already computerized to all hell; and more importantly, the people who like Tesla as a company (but haven't yet bought a Tesla car) are precisely the people that Google will be selling to - techies with an eye on the future.

So, who wants to take bets on how long it is until Google buys Tesla?",,False,self,t5_2t7no,False,,,True,t3_193kg5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/193kg5/prediction_google_will_buy_tesla_motors_within_10/,

Every day we are reminded how modern economics is failing us. Disease, death and homosexuality ruining society seems to be all we see in the news (the televised news.) ""The rapture is near!"" is all the general public gets through their FOXNews filter... The world IS far from perfect, far... However, the current state of humanity is far better than the general public perceives. 

The last few decades have proven to be great times for humanity. Renewable energy is on the march and the price of genome sequencing is plummeting. The Internet has connected a world of roughly 7 billion inhabitants, to the detriment of authoritarian regimes. Wikipedia has given access to humanity's combined knowledge to everyone in the world... for free; a true Library of Alexandria... Today's tribal leader with a smartphone has better access to global communication and information than the US president did thirty years ago. [We are living in some of the most peaceful times in history.](http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence.html) We are just scratching the surface in the world of quantum physics and the future is looking pretty interesting so far.

**What I'm calling for is a website similar to [whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com](http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/), but with bullet points emphasizing humanities current progress.**

**Please submit one-liners, stats, quotes, anything that is being done today that impresses you and makes you optimistic about humanity's current state.** 

Let's bring together the modern technologists, those in the medical fields, philosophers, scientists, physicists, humanitarians... Tell the world why what you are working on is changing the world for the better and why there is a strong case for cautious optimism.

If we do not open the general public's eyes to the incredible strides being made these days in every field (thanks in part to Moore's Law,) they may become overly pessimistic. The aggregate negativity of a misinformed public can create a self-fulfilling distopia, lets try and avoid that.

",655,150,659,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/xxvrf/i_am_jerome_glenn_ask_me_anything_about_running/,"Hi everyone, 

My name is Jason and I’ve been spending this summer working as an intern at the Millennium Project. The Millennium Project is a global futures study organization. Every year, they put out a report called the State of the Future. You can learn more about that here. 

http://www.millennium-project.org/millennium/challenges.html or 

http://www.millennium-project.org/millennium/2012SOF.html

My boss for the summer has been Jerome Glenn and he is honestly one of the most fascinating people I have ever met. He spearheaded the creation of this organization as a way to get humanity to collectively think about our future. In my entire time here, I have not been able to find a single topic that he couldn’t shed light on, from self driving cars to neural networks to the politics of the separate regions of China. I suggest asking him about any future related topic you are curious about.


There are also several other cool things you can talk to him about. The Millennium Project is currently launching a Collective Intelligence system, which is a better way to integrate the knowledge from top experts around the world on various topics. He is far better at explaining it than I am however, so I will leave that to him. 

Additionally, he has lived a fascinating life. He has contributed text to a book with Isaac Asimov, become a certified witch doctor in Africa and is a champion boomerang thrower. He has also met many of the big names in the futurist community. 

Ask away. Mr. Glenn will be logging on at 4:00 PM Eastern Standard to answer your questions

For a time, the former pandered to the stylistic elements of the field, while the latter was more rigorous, even scientific! Lo' and behold, this is unfortunately no longer the case. Both subreddits have congealed into the New-Age proving grounds of a cybercult, a cult which preaches an imminent rapture that will separate us all from our worldly norms and into heavenly immortality.  

These days, the majority of the threads on the boards merely have the *trappings* of scientific foresight, without the substance. In lieu of articles about chip density or the ""qualification problem"" of A.I., /r/futurology has been inundated by links to eschatological websites that refer to the Singularity as though it was the second coming of Christ! 

Though I support people like Jason Silva for expanding the appeal of futurology, his ilk spend most of their time talking in vaguely religious terms about the coming cyber-spiritual revolution. Hogwash!

How will the capabilities of Google's neural network differ from those of the human brain?,559,93,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1fvvv0/google_is_developing_a_neural_network_with_1/,"I read three pieces of information linked down below and became confused:

1. Apparently, [Google has plans to soon build](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/05/hinton/) a trillion node artificial neural network. Google's current artificial neural network has only 1 billion nodes. 

2. [A node in a neural network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) is the equivalent of an artificial neuron. 

3. The human brain has only about [84-100 billion neurons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron#Neurons_in_the_brain). This means that Google's planned artificial neural network will have 10 times as many neurons as the human brain. 

**Two questions:**

(Please keep in mind these questions stem from my lack of understanding of neuroscience or machine learning, so hopefully someone with a background in those areas could help me with these questions.)

1. How will Google's soon-to-be trillion neuron neural network differ from a human brain which has only 100 billion neurons?

2. Could such a network ever have the properties we associate with consciousness, or would that be unrealistic because its neurons are not arranged according to a [human brain's connectome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome)?

The Drake Equation asks not ""do they exist"" but ""how many can we expect?"". And, quite rightly, we fear what they might be capable of. 

But the worst they might be capable of is a mistake. Human research into artificial intelligence has been slow, and from someone who's studied it I can promise you we are *very* concerned with ideas such as the [Paperclip Maximizer](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer) or the [Utility Monster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster), and even now we work toward the idea of a [Friendly AI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_AI).

There are (probably) so many alien races though, surely there are some that aren't so careful? I wonder how common it is for an alien race to create one of these terrifying entities, and subsequently be consumed by it? This would leave the AI to explode out into space, devouring entire planets in its ill-conceived hunger. And by the time it met another species, it would be so vast in size and power that it would be almost impossible to stop. 

The last point is perhaps the most terrifying part; because this AI consumes everything between it and us, the farther away it starts the more powerful it is when it reaches us. So if this scenario is less likely, it is necessarily more dangerous. 

Am I wrong to be really worried about this? Can anyone think of any mechanism in the universe that would naturally prevent or limit this?

**TL;DR:** I worry that even if we make no mistakes with AI, other civilizations might, and those rogue AIs now haunt the universe. ",,False,self,t5_2t7no,False,,,True,t3_16oclr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16oclr/it_occurred_to_me_today_that_the_greatest_thing/,

Secondly I believe the creator of this subreddit, /u/Xenophon1 deserves our praise and gratitude for raising this community to the hights it has achieved.
I recall the days when we were less than 30 thousand people and now here we are as influential as ever, so lend your attention and allow me to address you all once again.

I have to say that since the rule change concerning the removal of memes has greatly focused and improved content coming from our many users, and the quality of discussion in general has improved as far as I can tell. However there is always more we can do to increase our reach, and ideas are always welcome and appreciated.

We as a community have achieved so much and I would like to extend my praise to all of you, truly well done. We have a [Futurology podcast](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1e3am7/the_futurology_podcast_episode_7_is_up/),a [twitter page](https://twitter.com/the__future), and we're even on [wired](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/08/preventing-skynet/). There is however another project that requires your attention. The realization of a [futurist party](http://www.reddit.com/r/futuristparty). This is something that could potentially allow us to vastly stretch our reputation.

The future is something we are all obviously passionate about so let us continue to work together to achieve further greatness. Feel free to check out /r/Futuristparty or any of our other outlets outside of this sub to add your voice and ideas.
Whether you have just discovered this subreddit or have been apart of it from the beginning we have all become a part of something greater and I am optimistic about how much we could actually change about the future, because after all we create the future every day with new ideas and exposure to current ideas.

finally, in the wise words of Xenophon1.
""I know, without evidence or reason, that our collective influence is powerful. It is momentous and growing in magnitudes of exponents. It's power is staggering, it's influence, frightening. Together, with these hundreds of voices, we can accomplish something. I know not fully what this is or is becoming. Only that there are many future(s) to our extraordinary communities.
I hope to hear our voices- resound again before the threshold of 100 thousand futurists strong. Yet, I also hope to hear our community's voice in another subreddit. This is an open source project, a project with still unsteady foundations.""

To the future(s)

I am JASON SILVA, filmmaker, media artist, futurist and observer of the human condition. I am excited to be doing this AMA with the Reddit community and thank you all for the opportunity!  My [latest short video](http://blog.ted.com/2012/06/26/exploring-openness-in-radical-video-jason-silva-at-tedglobal2012/) premiered at the TED conference in Edinburgh! Check it out sometime.

I was born in Venezuela, went to university for film and philosophy in Miami, lived in Los Angeles 5 years hosting a show on Al Gore's Current TV network.  For the past year I have been making my own non-commercial content to inspire people to engage big big ideas.  I LOVE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and awe for BIG IDEAS... But my work is ART first.  What I share is my opinion, an interpretation, my effort at creating content that pushes people to see things in a *new way*. I am addicted to being Inspired as an antidote to existential despair. I want to celebrate the best that humanity is capable of.   [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/a-timothy-leary-for-the-viral-video-age/255691/) described my work as ""movie trailers for ideas"" and called me ""The Timothy Leary of the Viral Video Age"".

Basically, what if at some point, infinitely far in the future, we've figured out the universe. Or at least, we can chemically formulate and compute our planet and history from the beginning. Essentially, this is a premise like the simulation argument (more on that below). Now, what if, given this knowledge, we were able to ""kill"" death, all the way from the beginning of human history - reform the minds of all those who had died, given our chemical/quantum knowledge, and place them in some ""afterlife"", maybe current society. This would probably be the noblest goal in all of science, and would effectively make it so death never even existed.

I'm sure most of you are familiar with Nick Bostrom's simulation argument. It basically states that given the following: humanity will eventually have the technology to create realistic simulations of the past, we will survive long enough to do so, and we will have an interest in doing so, it is infinitely more likely that we are in a simulation than in ""real"" reality (given that the simulated would also make simulations).

So how about a law that scales down the timeframe for how long the patent will last with the exponential growth of the economy. I don't know the exact time, but every year it should be cut in half. We could tie it to the amount of time it would take the average product to make 100 times R&amp;D costs.

Would a collection of AIs run different systems or would a single one govern a country? Does it just replace the bureaucracy or the entire electoral system of representatives too? Would a benefit be that given guiding principles, an AI should be ultra efficient and immune to corruption in the traditional sense? Humans tend to fear government because other fallible, corruptible humans run it - could an AI be the ultimate benevolent arbitrator of governance?

What do you envision?

**Edit 1 -** 

A better elaboration from my comment:

""Regarding the point about corruption due to human making, I find it helpful to think of a governance AI as being much like a constitution - yes there are shitty constitutions out there that are explicitly biased towards those who wrote it, but occasionally sound democratic and rights-ensuring provisions make their way into what are some of the most enlightened documents humanity has ever conceived. 

An AI could be much the same - if the intentions are good of the founding populace, they could encode rights and principles into an intelligent entity that would forever put them beyond the tampering of dictators or corrupt politicians. 

The server farms or supercomputers the AI was hosted on could be isolated or sealed off to avoid tamping, perhaps within a ""capital territory"" inside which the AI has force jurisdiction to protect itself should the need arise. 

Any ""patches"" or updates to the AI program by a representative body of the population  would be analysed by the AI itself to judge it's consistency with its founding principles and fundamental guaranteed rights. 

So an ""intelligent self protecting constitution"" that also handles the bureaucratic functions of government. ""
 

**Edit 2 -**

It seems most people feel an AI governance system would be very hard to implement in an existing nation-state, given competing interests, entrenched values and a population unaccustomed to it. 

Perhaps an alternative would be a prototype small scale city-state built from scratch, perhaps under the collaboration of the new class of young tech rich. 

**FINAL EDIT**

A lot of people have recommended some great fiction that has explored the ideas we've all discussed here, so I thought I might compile them in one easy place for anyone who is interested. Thanks to everyone who suggested something.

- ""Player Piano"" by Kurt Vonnegut, a heavily automated society divided into two distinct classes 
- ""I, Robot"" by Issac Asimov, specifically the last story 
- ""The Culture Series"" by Iain M. Banks, for an exploration of benevolent AIs (also where my username is from by coincidence)
- ""Polity"" by Neal Asher, Human/AI empire background
- ""The Dispossessed"" by Ursula LeGuin, Libertarian moon colonists working with AI systems
- ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", Anime
- ""PSYCHO-PASS"", Anime

Thanks!

My thoughts:

I remember seeing 'Transcendent Man' and thinking about how good of a term that is to describe humans relationship with technology; it allows us to 'transcend' our archaic traits and 'evolve' into something more advanced. 

I think religion has it completely backwards. God created man? No. Through our transcendent technology, man will create god - which will undoubtedly be some form of artificial intelligence. Through this creation, we will one day transcend into godlike beings ourselves, ultimately being saved by technology.

I've sent out a bunch of emails to people, but since it's now the weekend I think I'm in big trouble.

Anyone here work in the field and want to be on the radio?! Would take about 20 minutes and we can pre-record it so you don't have to worry about sounding like a tool on live radio. Discussion would be pretty general: What is AI, what obstacles are we facing, where is it going, etc...

 

Apologies for asking something like this here. I'm in full on panic mode. Many thanks

I wonder if it would be possible to tackle a small task and see how long it took us to come up with a solution.
I am obviously only talking about some relatively minor thing that hasn't been solved yet which will play some role in the future.
I am not thinking about any super AI, serious life extension or anything as those issues are HUGE, but it would be a interesting experiment to see if random people could come together and come up with something new.

Contribute with your idea(s) and we'll make a poll later on, whatever project gets the most votes is the first we'll try to finish. 
Hopefully the people who voted for some other than the ""winning project"" will still help and contribute. This is first and foremost a test to see if we can indeed get something going.

1375816436.0,148,self.Futurology,1jtwjc,Moore's Law is ending,181,33,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1jtwjc/moores_law_is_ending/,"[Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) states that transistor density on a chip doubles each year.  This has held true for an impressively long period of time after it was identified in 1965.

This is important to people other than chip engineers, because this growth in the past has caused exponential growth in computational power.  Double the transistor density, and you double computational power.  It is often considered important to predictions of the [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity), where the rate of technological growth is also exponential.

This exponential growth has also had a terrific impact on the world of manufacturing and technology.  Because processors are so much more powerful just a short while down the road, it makes little sense to create devices to keep for a long time.  Instead, it makes much more sense to make a device that lasts only a few years and throw it out, and replace it with something new that can take advantage of the new processor speeds.

However, about ten years ago, in 2003, the speed which with we can perform serial computations finally more-or-less hit a wall.  This was a major and important change.  If you take a chip and double its speed of serial computation, it just runs twice as fast.  Any problem that it could solve in two seconds before can now be solved in one second.  Even if the computer programmer doesn't do anything, his software becomes twice as fast in a year or eighteen months.  That process has not been happening for about a decade now.

We did maintain growth in transistor densities, but we could only take advantage of it by adding more parallelism.  The simplest form of this is simply running more-and-more processors side-by-side.  A typical current CPU has four or eight ""cores"" rather than one.

This is not nearly as good as doubling serial computational speed.  Programmers can break up *some* problems, but not all, into a new form where small parts of the problem are computed side-by-side, and then reassembled into a final answer.  Some problems cannot be solved in this fashion, and even for the ones that are, it is more difficult for a human to structure a problem this way.

I raise this here for two reasons:

* I was just reading an article by a [well-known computer engineer](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=1863) discussing the phenomenon and trying to predict the changes that it will cause in the hardware world.  This engineer was talking about the fact that it's not just that serial computational improvement has been stopped for a long time, but that the rate of increase in transistor density has been falling off for a while now.  It's still exponential, but at a slower-and-slower rate.  That's important, because that growth is what has been what is permitting the remaining improvement in parallel computation performance that has been available to us.

* In the past, when I've mentioned this on /r/futurology, [it has triggered downvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1i1zh7/cuts_to_research_budgets_could_slow_progress_in/cb0c1k5).  Since /r/futurology is a pretty nice place, I don't think that people downvote because they don't want to hear about the phenomenon, but because they are not aware that it has happened, and they want to avoid misinformation spreading (particularly since when there was a [citation attached](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/116561-the-death-of-cpu-scaling-from-one-core-to-many-and-why-were-still-stuck), comments got upvotes).  Since Moore's Law is referenced on here all the time, and is has played a role in the predictions of a number of readers, I think that being aware of what is happening in the industry is important.",,False,self,t5_2t7no,False,,,True,t3_1jtwjc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1jtwjc/moores_law_is_ending/,

Have we won, or have we failed?",158,30,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18yvjd/suppose_we_end_up_in_an_allpowerful_surveillance/,"http://ranprieur.com/

**February 20.** Last week I argued that it's better for us to have more freedom and power, which means more opportunities to harm other people and ourselves, even if it leads to more people being harmed. Obviously this has to be done in moderation, which is why I support moderate restrictions on guns and drugs and driving. Because if we increase freedom too fast, it can create so much trauma that there's a popular backlash, and a regression toward less personal power and more power monopolized by domination systems.

But there is a deeper issue: what are we working toward as a species? Suppose we end up in an all-powerful surveillance state, designed so that even if every human is a murderous psychopath, nothing bad can ever happen, and we all sit around taking euphoria drugs and consuming entertainment. Have we won, or have we failed? My utopian vision is at the other extreme: no authority, no restrictions, nothing is ever locked, the world is full of dangers, and yet it's rare for anything bad to happen, because humans have attained godlike levels of personal virtue and awareness. We may never get there, but I think that's what we should be aiming for.

More generally, I could frame the conflict between these visions as a conflict between internal progress and external progress. Is it more important to improve human nature or improve the human condition? Along another axis there is a political question: how far do you go in using central control? And which improvements work with or against central control?

I've noticed that technological progress is usually described as if improving the human condition is the only thing that matters. So if we build machines to do everything for us, that's good, even if we lose the ability to do anything for ourselves.

1364389681.0,119,self.Futurology,1b3vqx,How should we best prepare for technological unemployment?,154,35,190,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1b3vqx/how_should_we_best_prepare_for_technological/,"Technological unemployment is a phenomenon that has been occurring for centuries, but up until now the unemployment it has caused has been balanced by new types of employment.  Now we're reaching the point where it may start happening faster than new jobs can keep up.  

Consider some of the types of jobs that could disappear in the near future:

* Assembly line &amp; manufacturing jobs being replaced by robots such as Baxter and 3D printing advancements
* Truck drivers, delivery drivers, taxi drivers being replaced by autonomous vehicles
* Diagnosticians and some other doctors being replaced by AI such as Watson
* Paralegals also being replaced by Watson for e-discovery purposes
* Warehouse workers being replaced by warehouse automation systems such as Kiva
* Call center workers being replaced by AI systems
* Farmers being replaced by planting &amp; harvesting robots
* Military personnel being replaced by aerial and ground based drones


In general it seems that most of the jobs to be lost first will be of the relatively unskilled kind.  New jobs will be created that enable and support this automation, but most of them will require higher skill levels and more education.  And these new jobs probably won't be available in comparable quantities.  

So if this does happen, what do we do?  How can our economies support ever-increasing levels of unemployment?  Can we somehow take some of the cost savings associated with the greater levels of automation and give stipends to the people whose jobs are lost so they can pursue other interests and careers?  What are your ideas?

1370725678.0,112,self.Futurology,1fy1x2,I think gradually decreasing the maximum allowed hours in a workweek might be a great way to usher in a post-scarcity and post-work society,139,27,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1fy1x2/i_think_gradually_decreasing_the_maximum_allowed/,"Long text, but please give it a chance.

I was thinking what might happen if the governments of developed countries made new regulations which would cap the allowed workweek at 40 hours and decrease the workweek by something like two hours every year so that after ten years the maximum is 20 hours or even less. Critical jobs such as brain surgeons for example would be temporarily excluded from this rule until they can reach the capacity where it is possible to decrease the workweek without sacrificing health of patients in the case of the surgeon.

I think that while it would initially cause quite a shock to the system it would also yield a great number of benefits:

* One the one hand sharing the jobs that are still around reduces unemployment. While the scarcity of labor will increase the hourly wages as companies have to compete to be able to fill their vacancies. As hourly wages increase the huge gap that has grown over the past decades between worker productivity and wages will narrow again. In the short term this would give the middle and lower classes more money again, and since they are most likely to spend money it might boost consumption and the economy too.

* Another effect of these measures could be to speed up the transition to a post-scarcity and post-work society. This is because the increased wages of the employees will drive companies to put even more effort in automation.

* There will be a lot of people who, even with the scarcity of labor that will result, won't be able to find a job because they lack the skills and are unable to learn them. However, these people will be out of a job soon regardless of how work is arranged. I'm thinking about all the people replaced by driverless cars, 3D printing, robotics, and Watson-like systems. In the scenario I propose these people might actually have a better chance as companies might be willing to invest more in the training of low skilled people when there is such high scarcity of labor. 

* Like in all future scenarios, it will be tough for the first people who become permanently unemployed, but if the scarcity of work does result in less unemployment in the near term, paying these people a decent amount of welfare won't be such a big drain on the rest of society. 

* Another huge advantage I see is that this system almost automatically insure a somewhat gradual transition to a post-work society. People will have to find new activities to fill the extra leisure time that keeps building until it's the primary concern that labor used to be. Once people find new meaning it won't feel like they've become worthless once their day job ceases to exist. 

* The increase in leisure time of the employed will also drive an enormous expansion of the entertainment industry and technology. The demand for things to do with the increased leisure time might also create a huge number of new jobs that people like to do but can't at this point. Think about the huge increases in demand for people who can teach the whole gamut of sport, crafts, and hobbies. Also the whole education system is ripe for a revolution where the ratio of teachers to pupils increases dramatically, giving teachers nicer jobs and children a much better and personalized education.

* In this system it's also clear to everyone from the outset that unemployment is the logical endpoint of the transition. This will also help low-skilled people who become unemployed earlier to feel and be less marginalized by society.

To me this seems almost too good to be possible, so I think I might be overlooking some macro-economic disaster that this system would result in. What do you guys think?

**TL;DR**  
Gradually decreasing the workweek will make everyone better off, bring post-scarcity even closer, and prepare people and society for a life of leisure.

For many of us a book was our first introduction to the world of Futurology (even though it probably wasn't called that). I propose we create a list with all of the best books related to, and about, Futurology. To begin, the list will be split into Fiction and Non-Fiction sections. If users feel that there are other more interesting ways to break the list down then PM me with your proposal. 

If you want me to add something to the list just comment on this post with the Title and Author and I will add it. However, if the community decides, through voting, that a recommendation is not worthy of this list I will remove it. To clarify; all recommendations will be automatically added to the reading list and it is the Futurology community's responsibility to decide if a new inclusion stays or goes. Vote responsibly :)

I've spoken with Xenophon and he has agreed to put this list on the sidebar once it gets going.

Finally, everything I've said is subject to change. We're a community and as such I'm not interested in being the List Dictator (TM). If you don't like something, or think we can do it better, let me know.

1365436838.0,104,self.Futurology,1bx9i0,Greed is NOT Good,329,225,344,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1bx9i0/greed_is_not_good/,"The rapid rise in BitCoin ""value"" and the creation of more than a few speculative ""millionaires"" only demonstrates to me that we are still far from taming the human desire to play ""haves"" vs ""have nots"".  

Equally annoying - I've read some opinions that those that ""bought into"" BitCoin early deserve millions. 

Deserve...deserve...

Deserve is a strange choice of words. Especially because these sentiments often come from the same folks who hate(envy) those that ""bought into"" the Wall Street/Fed racket before 2008. Or those that ""bought into"" the housing boom early. Did my neighbor **deserve** to make 400,000 dollars in 2005 for simply buying a home in 2000?

BitCoin is making new highs every day - average hard working people who have not even heard of it yet (yes, they are still out there because there are too busy with their work or projects to notice financial news) will soon wake up and panic when they see this ship is taking off and they better do anything they can to get on - or miss it altogether. Just like the housing boom. They will lose time, effort, and resources out of fear of being left behind.

We are better than this. Aren't we tired of playing this same ol' game over and over? 

We don't need a cryptocurrency to move into the future. Our goal as a species should be to move away from ""money"" altogether.  We are better than this ""get rich by holding onto something rare"" mentality. We are so close to the Age of Abundance (Peter Diamandis), let's not squander this decade by building huge digital fortresses to protect our BitCoins - and then train cyber armies to pillage them.

Also, if BitCoin plays out the way many think - and if each coin is ""worth"" a billion or trillion dollars - do you think that the ""powers that be"" in today's economy will just happily give up their wealth? No, it will be a new Game of Thrones. This will eventually lead to panic, violence, and perhaps warfare. Not virtual warfare - real warfare. Already tremendous talent is being wasted to steal wallets and to hack exchanges instead folding proteins, extending lifespans, or improving battery efficiency. We're repeating the intellectual waste of the ""quants"" on Wall Street.

If you have extra ""money"" - instead of investing in gold, oil, BitCoin, or any other resource which has ""value"" only because it is limited - invest in companies and projects that are truly changing the world for the better. Not because it will make you rich - because it will feed the poorest of us, reverse environmental damage, and cure diseases.

Instead of using your computer to mine BitCoins - donate that processing time to science.

It seems that all we have done these past few weeks is to perpetuate greed. We've only shown the world that we (the tech-minded professionals as many of us on reddit are) are no better than the Robber Barons and Wall Street suits. It appears that instead of valiantly developing a Singularity outcome - we're pettily funneling a BitCoin income. We're playing the very game we were hoping to eliminate.

(mock Gekko speech) ""The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed -- for lack of a better word-- is NOT good.

Greed never works.

Greed corrupts, cuts down, and holds back our evolutionary spirit.

Greed, in all of its forms -- greed for resources, for money (BitCoin), for ideology, security -- has marked just about every war and tragedy of mankind.

And greed -- you mark my words -- can only slow progress from here, and will create more hurdles to technological breakthroughs than remove them.""

Folks, there's already enough ""money"" out there in circulation to fund the projects we need to evolve our species to the next level. Let's pool our talents and resources to move closer to THAT goal - and not waste it meandering in the Wilderness, worshiping the new BitCoin calf.
