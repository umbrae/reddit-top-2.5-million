1343264312.0,487,self.arizona,x5w6m,"By request in /r/Arizona: IAmA Police Officer in Arizona, AMAA",603,116,966,http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/x5w6m/by_request_in_rarizona_iama_police_officer_in/,"While I did one awhile ago in the regular IAmA subreddit, I was [asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/wx04h/please_do_not_reelect_joe_arpaio/c5i04840) to post one in /r/Arizona. So here we are.

I added the ""Almost"" to it because I will not answer any questions as to my identity, what agency I work for, or a specific area where I work. This is because I can be accused of policy violations if I give the appearance that I am commenting as a representative of my agency. 

And off course, here is my [proof](http://imgur.com/5sWCq)

EDIT: WoW. I went to sleep at about 4am last night, and when i woke up there was a flood of new questions and comments. I am not ignoring them, just give me some time and I'll go through and respond the best that I can. 

EDIT: #2: Wow again, I got roflstomped with questions and feedback on this one. I am flattered and am doing the best I can to keep up. If you asked a serious questions and I have not replied yet, I apologize and ask for patience. I will go through all of them over time and answer every serious question that I can. 

EDIT #3: I finally went through everything and answered every serious question I could. If you had a serious question and I missed it, feel free to message me with it again and I'll be happy to answer.

There is one thing I want to say. There is obviously one thread that sticks out, and that is what I am referring to. I got a lot of responses like this, so rather than type the same thing a dozen times I'm going to put it here. A lot of people commented, saying they were sorry that I had to experience that. 

Do not apologize, and do not be sorry that I had to do it. That is just one story of tragedy among many, it just happens to be the worst. I have seen many things in this career which I can only describe as horrors. But do not feel sorry for me having to deal with it. That is why I do this job, and so do many many other Police Officers, EMTs, and Fire Fighters. Someone needs to be there to deal with these things. I do it so you don't have too. I wouldn't have it any other way.

So I have to share some things with you fine people.

1. Arizona has more parks and national monuments than any other state, more mountains than Switzerland, and more golf courses than Scotland.

2. Arizona is roughly the size of Italy.

3. The sun shines in southern Arizona 85% of the time, which is considerably more sunshine than Florida or Hawaii.  Arizona also frequently has the hottest and coldest temperatures on the same day. The temperature could be 75 degrees in the desert to 45 degrees in the high country.

4. The world’s largest solar telescope is located at Kitts Peak National Observatory in the city of Sells.

5. Highest Point:  Humphreys Peak 3851 m (12,633 ft)

6. Dry state? my ass, Water Area:  943 sq km (364 sq mi)

Now here is where it goes cluster. I stood in line for a good long time watching this lady fill out the forms on the provisional ballots and give people instructions.

Yep. She was not collecting signatures on the roster for anyone who she gave a provisional to. Worse yet, after the realized this she let two more people drop the ballot in the box without getting a signature from them.

Proposition 121 seems like a really good idea (open primaries, supposedly making candidates more moderate) but it would be a DISASTER if it passes. 

Pro 121 modifies the state constitution to only allow the top 2 vote-getting candidates in the August primary to advance to the November election. You will never be able to vote for an Independent or a Green or a Libertarian again. This applies to all offices, so there's an excellent chance that you'll be choosing between two Republicans for Governor, or two Democrats for Congress. Not really much of a choice!

Proponents say that this will make candidates more modeate, but that hasn't been proven and hasn't been the case in other states that have adopted this kind of system. The worst part is that our Legislature will be tasked with rewriting all our election laws to accomodate the changes, including Clean Elections (which was passed by the citizens).

1286897122.0,23,self.arizona,dq840,Tea Party trying to hijack Central AZ Water Conservation District - Please Vote Wisely!,29,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/dq840/tea_party_trying_to_hijack_central_az_water/,"The Tea Party is attempting to hijack the Board of Directors of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District in order to cut it to the bone. This obscure office is the three county elected board that runs the CAP Canal. There are 15 board members, and this year 5 seats from Maricopa County are open. The election is non partisan, and you “vote for 5” from among a slate this year of 15 candidates.

One of Arizona’s most important, and longest standing, traditions, is that water transcends partisan politics. Our extraordinary record of quality water management is the result of more than 100 years of bi-partisan and non-partisan cooperation. Carl Hayden, John Rhodes, Barry Goldwater, Morris Udall, Bruce Babbitt, John McCain and Jon Kyl are all examples of this outstanding tradition.

But this year, the tradition is at risk. A group of extreme, partisan, and stunningly unknowledgeable people are trying to take over the CAP Board. Why? Because it’s easy, and because they believe that all government is bad and should be cut, cut, cut. Their only stated platform is to end the CAP’s employee retirement system and to reduce the staff. The CAP has fewer than 500 employees, and it’s budget and operations are mainly paid for from water and power sales. There is a very minor property tax, which is used to stabilize the operations and protect our water supplies. No matter how much anyone feels that government has gotten too big or intrusive, that shouldn’t have anything to do with this race.

DON’T LET THE EXTREMISTS TAKE OVER THE CAP!!! This is a very big deal, but is easily lost in all the noise. Here are the candidates, grouped by recommendation:

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:

Frank Fairbanks - Retired Phoenix City Manager. As solid, steady, smart, decent and capable a person as you could possible ask for. Registered Independent. Lots of past experience on water issues. Endorsed by Arizona Republic after they interviewed the candidates.

David S. “Sid” Wilson - Retired General Manager of the CAWCD. 40+ years of water management experience. One of the most expert people in the field in the U.S. Republican. Also endorsed by Az. Republic.

Tim Bray - Currently incumbent board member. Water consultant, primarily to major developers and cities. Creative, extremely knowledgeable on water markets and pricing, which are becoming more and more important. I’m pretty sure he’s a Republican. Endorsed by Az. Republic.

Jim Holway - Formerly Assistant Director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources. After leaving ADWR, worked at ASU in the Global Institute of Sustainability. Now at the Sonoran Institute, which is a moderate environmental organization. Has a balanced, environmental perspective. Democrat. Endorsed by Az Republic.

Ray Jones - Water Consultant, primarily to private water companies. Formerly President of Arizona American Water. Very knowledgeable on utility operations, water pricing, and water conservation issues. I’d guess he’s a Republican, but I don’t actually know.

RECOMMENDED: These are also totally solid candidates and would be fine board members.

Karl Kohloff. Retired water management professional. Used to run Mesa’s water system. One of the truly “grand old water buffaloes” of Arizona. Probably a Republican, but again I really don’t know or care.

Arif Kazmi. Civil Engineer who works for ADOT. Registered Professional Engineer. Not a water guy, but really interested and has huge experience with big infrastructure issues. I’ve been told he’s a Democrat. Endorsed by Arizona Republic.

Andy Yates. Young guy who worked at the Arizona Capitol Museum. Now has his own PR/Consulting business. Really eager and interested in water. Young Republican looking to break into public policy issues.

Brian Munson. Works for mining company ASARCO. Formerly Director of Water Quality at the Arizona Department of Water Resources. Registered independent.

STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED:

Mark Lewis. (Not the newscaster). Incumbent Board Member. I served with Mark on the Board and have known him a long time. He’s often a decent board member, though he sees everything in terms of political advantage. He has organized the “insurgent” group to take over the board and “shrink government”. I think it’s mostly about getting himself elected President of the Board. Republican, as are all the following.

TC Bundy. One of the hard core slate who knows nothing about water issues.

Raymond Johnson. Ditto.

Cynthia Moulton. Ditto.

John Rosado. Ditto.

PLEASE TAKE THIS VOTE SERIOUSLY!!! The CAWCD is local, efficient, non partisan government at its best, and it’s really at risk this year. Feel free to forward this on to anyone.

1350691360.0,23,self.arizona,11rxti,One AZ Liberal's Guide to the Propositions,47,24,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/11rxti/one_az_liberals_guide_to_the_propositions/,"**Prop 114: No** (Crime Victim Protection from Liability)

This prohibits anybody committing a felony to sue the victim of the crime, if said felonious individual was hurt by negligence on the part of the victim.  It is a constitutional amendment proposed by the legislature.

This seems okay on the surface, but just doesn't hold up under scrutiny.  It's taking away some constitutionally protected rights and for what?  What's the benefit that out weighs the cost?  The only letter in support of this listed a case where a burglar sued a homeowner after falling on the knife in the homeowner's kitchen.  If that sounds familiar, it's because that was part of the movie ""Liar Liar"".  The proponents of this amendment can't even come up with a case where it would apply, in the real world.  It's giving up too much for too little.

**Prop 115: NO!** (Judicial Selection)

Another legislature sponsored constitutional amendment.  This has quite a few clauses and I agree with more than a couple of them.  It comes down to cost vs benefit.  In this case, the ""cost"" is that it gives the executive branch a lot more power in selecting judges.  Specifically, it removes the ""merit based"" process of selecting judges in favor of one that is fundamentally party based.  It will attempt to destroy the independent judiciary and replace it with judges firmly in the pocket of a small group of powerful people.  No!  A thousand times, no!

**Prop 116: No** (Personal Business Property Tax Exemption Amount)

This is not an obvious one and I could see being convinced the other way.  It's billed as a ""Small Business Job Creation Act"", but as far as I can tell, it mostly benefits larger businesses.  A constitutional amendment that primarily benefits large businesses -- what a surprise!  Well, it'll cost an estimated $170 million in 2014.  Who loses?  Counties.  This tax is levied by the county, so it'll be a huge hit to the already cash-strapped county governments.  Who wins?  Mostly big businesses with a huge amount of capitalized equipment.  But... yes, it will help some small businesses, as well.  That's what makes this non-obvious.

In the end, it's a constitutional amendment that gives yet another tax cut to big business.  The fact that it will also help a small number of small businesses isn't enough to out weigh that.

**Prop 117: No** (Property Tax Assessed Value Limit)

Caps property tax increases to 5%.  Because of our skyrocketing property values, see?  Remember those?

Why are we being asked for a constitutional amendment to fight a problem that doesn't exist, yet artificially restricts what can be done in the future?  No benefit with too high a cost.

**Prop 118: Yes** (Permanent State Land Endowment Fund, Distribution)

The state has a Permanent Endowment Fund that was established back in 1910 to produce revenue for schools, colleges, hospitals, etc.  Profits from the $3.5B fund are distributed via a formula established all those years ago.  This ratio is designed to keep the fund stable, and varies depending on if the year was good or not.

This constitutional amendment makes the distribution higher and more stable.  It's the higher part that's problematic.  This is a PERMANENT fund and if it's sucked dry just because the legislature keeps funneling our money to businesses and the rich, then it would have been wasted.  Yet... times are tough, now, and it's the schools that are hurting, not the wealthy.  Maybe it would be okay for now?

**Prop 119: Yes** (State Land Trust Exchanges)

It's a constitutional amendment, but it's a necessary one.  This is also related to the State Trust land.  Basically, the constitution doesn't allow for any part of it to be exchanged for equivalent or better private land, even if it's in the best interest of the trust.  There have been many attempts to rectify this in the past, but all attempts have failed.  This is the best attempt yet.  It ensures that any exchange will be in the best interest of the trust AND is fully transparent to the public.  It's about time.

**Prop 120: Hell No** (Let's Start a New Civil War)

How is this even on the ballot?  It is an attempt to claim ""state sovereignty"" over air, water, land, etc within the state.  That is to say, the Federal government can't tell us what to do with our land.  Except... of course they can.  The idea that we can just say ""we're not going to follow Federal laws"" and that's that is just ludicrous.  It used to be that you'd only hear things like this coming from some guy wearing a tin-foil hat sitting in his mobile home out in the desert by Yuma.  To have it on the ballot is just mind blowing.

**Prop 121: No** (Top Two Primaries)

This opens up the primaries to all voters, and then takes the top two vote getters to compete during the general elections.  There's a lot to like about this idea, not the least of which is that both the Republican and Democrat leadership hate it.  Anything that takes power away from the established power brokers is a good thing.  Proponents of this prop say that it will open up more changes for Independents, that it will reduce extremism in the major parties, and that it will cause people to vote more in the primaries.  We don't have to take their word for it, though -- there are already multiple states that have enacted this and we can see empirically what happened.  In short, none of the touted benefits have surfaced.  In CA, the only independents to make it to the general election were personally wealthy; some districts had multiple (extreme) members from one party, even though the districts were pretty evenly mixed; and the turnout for the primaries were at all time lows.

The current election process has serious flaws in it and reform is definitely needed.  Unlike Prop 204 (later), though, there are better alternatives to this.  It's better to hold out for true reform than to pass this ineffective measure.

**Prop 204: Yes** (Make the 1% Education Sales Tax Permanent)

There is a lot to like about this and a lot to dislike.  It's not as obvious as some of the others.

At the core, AZ is one of the worst states in the nation for funding and supporting K-12.  We absolutely cannot trust that the legislature will ever elevate education to a proper level.  Making the 1% sales tax permanent would guarantee a baseline of money (on the order of $750M) that the legislature simply can't touch.  That can only be a good thing.

On the other hand, it does this with a sales tax, which is the most regressive of all taxes.  This is effectively a tax increase that will mostly hurt lower income families and spare those that can most afford it.  Also, 20% of this money goes to various special interest groups.  This includes highway funds.  What does that have to do with education?  Finally, handling budget items via 'mandate by ballot' sets a dangerous precedent.  Yes, we can't trust the legislature to give education the priority it needs, but trusting a ballot process for this may be possibly worse.

   In the end, this sales tax makes me deeply uncomfortable.  Surely there must be a better way to handle it!  But what?  Opponents to 204 spend all their time saying how bad this is, but never offer up a better solution.  This may be a poor solution to a serious problem, but it is at least A solution.

A lot of us, including myself, havent been able to make it one, or both of the last two meet ups. It seems to me, like that been mostly because 1) the meet ups have been mostly over 21 and 2) the meet ups have been on saturday nights, when some people have obligations.

What are some ideas of what we could do? Once we have a place/event we want to go to Ill start up an online poll for the best time and day.

EDIT:
Okay, so it seems like the two big ideas are bowling, my house (perhaps with the addition of bowling), and a brewery, which excludes people under 21. I just want to get an idea of how many people approve of each idea. So lets do an voting system like how fauxpasgrapher did it last time. Ive made two comments for each idea, please upvote your preference. And then we can worry about when the event is going to happen afterwards.

**EDIT 2**:
I am very confused that bowling is both the top and bottom comment in this thread. So what I am going to do is host a reddit meet up house party that I dont think conflicts with anyone's desire to go bowling.

Here is a link to an online poll. http://doodle.com/mkw5kdy8xw7qsr6z Just put in your name, and then check the times that would work for you, and in maybe like 3 or 4 days we will see what time/day works best for everyone. The days are the tuesdays and thursdays of each week staring the 29th of june, and ending on the 19th of august. The times are in thirty minute intervals between 630 and 8. I dont know when people like to go bowling, or how to organize a bowling event. If we want to go bowling before coming to my house, when would you guys want to show up and start bowling? Does anyone have any insights about bowling, or would volunteer to reserve a lane or whatever is necassary?

What do you guys think? Does this plan sound good?

**EDIT #**

Its confirmed! Thursday the 12th, at my house, come between 7 and 7:30 pm, and bring whatever youd like (food, booze, board or video games (my room mates and I collectively have an xbox 360, a Wii, a PS2, a sega saturn, and a dreamcast)). If you are going to bring booze please remember that I am inviting people under 21 years old. Think about how and if you are going to distribute that alcohol, and maybe talk to me about it first if you arent sure.

It was a three way tie of availability between the 10th, the 12th, and the 17th, so I know a lot of people will get excluded. But, we seem to be doing these meet ups at a rate of 1 per month. For those of you who wont be able to make it, Im sure there will be more opportunities in the future.

1375466634.0,22,self.arizona,1jkt63,Someone's life is in the balance. Please help me get in touch with this woman's daughter. Details inside.,29,7,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/1jkt63/someones_life_is_in_the_balance_please_help_me/,"First: let me be clear. I do not want ANYONE'S personal information!! This is not a witch hunt to find personal information or dig up someone without their knowledge. I need to find the daughter of someone who is clearly lost and needs help.  I'm hoping someone in Arizona may know the daughter and I will give them MY information to pass along.  So please, do not post any personal information in this chat about anyone!  Thank you in advance.

Now for the details...

For a few years I have been receiving sporadic and wildly weird emails from a woman, Marie, who used to be my neighbor.  Each email gets progressively worse... she was originally in a shelter, then living in a church, ... now she's homeless and literally living in doorways in Maryland somewhere.  She gets onto the email only so often and blasts out horrifying details about how bad her life is and how she wants it all to end.  The last email is quite frankly the worst - I know something will happen to her. She is either so bad off that it is inevitable she will die, or she is going to commit suicide.  

Sadly, I have no way of reaching Marie except to try and reply to the email and hope she gets back to me.  The last time this happened, it was nearly a year between emails.  The most recent email arrived 2 days ago.  I have no knowledge of her physical location. Other than a few clues, which I think WILL lead me to her location.  But I will have to travel there.  Before I go, I need to TRY and reach her daughter.

The emails are quite a plight. But I suspect there is far more than the story I am being told. I think Marie is clearly having problems: either she is suffering mentally or has an addiction.  Either case, I have NO facts, NO knowledge, and only a willingness to help.  I don't know a single person in Marie's life - except her daughter. 

Marie and Lindsay used to live out in Philly until they moved to Arizona ages ago. Lindsay has grown up and attended school in your fine state. 

I'm going to put the information I remember about her, and ask anyone in Arizona knows a Lindsay that is in her 20s (maybe near 30)... whose mother was named Marie... PLEASE reach out to her. Please ask her to agree to talk with me, even if it is just to confirm my fears that her mother is suffering from addiction. 

I'm petrified that her mother may have suffered a mental breakdown and that Lindsay is trying to find her... and I may be the link to help her.  

I'm frightened that Marie is truly dying (even if it is from her own actions/deeds) and may be desperate for help. All I can do is try to help - and to let Lindsay know everything I know. Hell, Lindsay may not *want* to know - but I have to try. 

What I know:
 - They lived in Philadelphia next door to me
 - Daughter's name is Lindsay (marie? Alberta?) Phillips
 - White pages lists a few, and I've called. none of them are her. 
 - Lindsay and I communicated very infrequently over the years, so she should remember me. I hope she remembers her childhood home - because I'm going to rely on that to verify it is her
 - Lindsay could very easily have married and changed her name... but she went to school in Arizona and she must have friends/associates on line! (it's the right age!)

I'll leave the rest of the details out as part of the vetting process to ensure we have the right parties in place.

OK Reddit. This is the only thing I can think of doing.  

If you know a Lindsay - check to see if she may be my long lost neighbor all grown up. Then tell her I'm desperate to speak with her, private message me, and we'll vet specifics to make sure it is really her. Then I'll give out my personal information so you can give it to her. 

Thanks Reddit. 

P.S.: I'm open to other ideas. I've never been involved in anything like this.  I have no idea why Marie would be contacting ME with her plight. We've hardly spoken in over 20 years. It just feels wrong, but I feel obligated to do something with this knowledge/information.

Last night got a few bites along my ankles above the socks, and part way up my sleeves. I read up about mosquitoes but we're not seeing any of them in the house. We have ponds on the property but every one of them has those larvae eating fish.

So, are mosquitoes here just really really friggen small? I lived in Southern Utah for a few years. I'm familiar with no-see-um's. But those leave a hole in the skin where they bite. And I'm pretty good at see'n 'em. These bites appear like normal bug bites. Could it be bed bugs, or little spiders? what else is there in Southern AZ that could leave annoying itchy bug bites?!? How would I check for and get rid of them?",,False,,t5_2qn1z,1374775936.0,,,True,t3_1j1iux,http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/1j1iux/new_to_southern_az_wtf_is_biting_me/,

I wasn't sure where to post this, I figured this was probably the best place.  Any other suggestions would be welcome.  


I live out in San Tan Valley/Queen Creek area; Ironwood and Ocotillo.  This afternoon, my neighbor to my east informed my mom that his dogs were missing.  There were no dig marks under the gate and the gate was closed, there was no lock though.  Sadly, the owner had taken off their collars so they would not get tangled in anything while he was gone.  A few days previous to this, our other neighbor to the West told my mom that she had went to let her her pup in, and he was missing as well.  She was able to get him back though thankfully.  


So, if you see a chocolate lab around the age of 4 and a boxer around the age of 3 running around in Queen Creek or San Tan Valley without collars, please let me know.  Also, please lock your gates.  If this has been an isolated incident, I would think nothing of, that the dogs got out somehow or something, but apparently it isn't.  Especially since I saw other dogs roaming in my neighborhood recently.  This deeply saddens me since my neighbor loves his pups and they are some awesome dogs.  Mine and his place through the fence all the time.

You notice your car overheating before you drive it.

You no longer associate bridges or rivers with water.

You know a swamp cooler is not a happy hour drink.

You can hear the weather forecast of 105 degrees and cheer.

You can be in the snow, then drive for an hour and it will be over 100 degrees.

You discover, in July it only takes two fingers to drive your car, because your steering wheel is so hot.

You can make sun tea instantly.

You run your a/c in the middle of winter so you can use your fireplace.

The best parking is determined by shade, not distance.

You realize that ""Valley Fever"" isn't a disco dance.

Hotter water comes from the cold water tap than the hot one.

It's noon in July, kids are on summer vacation and the streets are totally empty of both cars and people.

You are marked 'part of the Arizona herd' by your seat belt brand(s).

Sunscreen is sold year round, kept right at the checkout counter.

Umbrellas are anti-sun devices.

Some fools will market mini-misters for joggers and some other fools will actually buy them. Worse.....some fools actually try to jog.

You know hot air balloons can't rise because the air temperature is hotter than the air inside the balloon.

No one would dream of putting vinyl inside a car.

You see two trees fighting over a dog.

You can say ""Hohokam"" and people don't think you're laughing funny.

You see more irrigation water on the street than there is in the Salt River.

You have to go to a fake beach for some fake waves.

Rain is news, not weather.

You can pronounce ""Saguaro"", ""Tempe"", ""San Xavier"", ""Canyon de Chelly"", ""Mogollon Rim"" and ""Cholla"".

You can understand the reason for a town named ""Why"".

You can put trays of cinnamon rolls in the dash of your car when you start work in the morning and have them baked by lunch!

You want to punch people that say, ""But it's a DRY heat!""

You buy salsa by the gallon.

Your Christmas decorations include sand and 100 paper bags.

All of your out-of-state friends start to visit after October but clear out come the end of April.

You think someone driving wearing oven mitts is clever.

Most of the restaurants in town have the first name ""El"" or ""Los.""

You think 60 tons of crushed red rock makes a beautiful yard.

Your house is made of stucco and has a red clay tile roof.

Vehicles with open windows have the right-of-way in the summer.

Most homes have more firearms than people.

Kids will ask, ""What's a mosquito?""

People who have black cars or black upholstery in their car are automatically assumed to be from out of-state or nuts.

You know better than to get into a car with leather seats if you're wearing shorts.

Drivers with their windows rolled down have right of way.

I need to meet some people in that area who I can count on to give me reliable information because I have not been able to find what I need via google and search engines.

Does Rent increase like this at every renewal? Does it typically jump increase this much? I figured it may increase 10-20 bucks if anything but was not expecting them increase it $840/yr. They are around $840 something now after taxes.

Our budget is very tight this year and we don't have the money to ship the donated gear to Los Angeles. It's also a bit much to ask of our volunteers to drive all the way to Arizona and back (also very expensive in gas).

If anyone living in the Phoenix area is planning a trip to or near L.A, and doesn't mind hauling a couple extra boxes of gear with them, it would be incredibly helpful and I would be very grateful! If you need some compensation for gas, I'll see if I can get it approved. If you happen to be staying and would like to attend our conference, I'll line you up with some free tickets!

The conference is for two days and begins March 2nd. We need the equipment before then, preferably soon as possible since the person donating the equipment is in the process of moving and needs to get rid of it.

I'm left wondering if this is a good idea. I mean I imagine it'll be really hot.

So I ask you all, what do you think. Is August a bad time to go visiting parks, especially with children? Or might it be OK if I take sufficient precautions? (Bring lots of fluids, wear a hat etc.)?

I haven't gotten much past Googling, and already I'm confused.

It looks to me like Gilbert, Mesa, Chandler, Scotsdale, etc, are all really Phoenix, in the same way that Alston is really Boston or The Bronx is just New York City. Is that the case, or am I reading the Google Maps wrong?

For me, one of the advantages of moving off the East Coast might be to buy a house with a large amount of land, never see my neighbors, have a horse and safely shooting on my land whenever I want (see username). Is this something I'm going to be able to do within commuting-distance of Gilbert/Chandler? A quick Google finds only ""estates"" that cost over $1 Million, which is probably more than twice what I really want to spend. More than a few over $10 Million, actually...

I assume I'm searching badly, and that not everyone with more than 10 acres in Arizona is a multi-millionaire. Right?

Is there anything I should know about living in the desert? I assume there's less water (duh) but does this become a major issue living outside of city limits?

I wanted to take this Christmas evening to introduce myself to you. I'm a 32 year old dude, run an apparel sales agency, and I'm r/trees friendly. I'd really like to meet some people who I may have some things in common with.

I'm a very normal semi-professional with hippy aspirations. I live in Chandler with my two dogs (photo in comments, they are awesome)

I moved here without knowing anyone a few years ago and I have had a tough time meeting people here because I A) work from home and B) suffer from some social anxiety (probably stemming from being picked on in 3rd grade, so don't let your kids be bullies)

I'd love to hear back from anyone, but I'm really hoping to hear from free thinking, open minded, and progressive thinkers who enjoy discussing current news, politics, and or life events.

Please feel free to introduce yourself to me.

I talked to legal services at school and the guy told me that by law, they have to physically serve you within 120 days or the ticket is invalid.  It had been over a year and I hadn't heard anything, so I figured the city gave up on the ticket.  

Smash cut to a few days ago - I received a letter saying my license was being suspended for not paying the ticket.  I called the city court and they told me they had a record of service on file and that the person served my dad and that the car that was ticketed was in the driveway.  The name listed for my dad was not my dad's name.  My dad lives in another city and doesn't come to my house.  So it's pretty clear the process server lied or fucked up, but I definitely was not served.

Legal advice funding got cut from my school so it's no longer available.  I'm planning on fighting this, but I'm not sure what to expect from a small town court.  I feel like I have sufficient proof that I wasn't served, but I also feel like they could just rule against me (what's to stop them?).  I think the way it works is that they call the process server in and it's his word against my defense.  I was hoping someone else might have some experience with this or some advice?  Thanks.

I've seen several that I like from a place called Cactus Jack's, and there are very few (negative) reviews from them.    

I was wondering if anyone from reddit has purchased a vehicle from them, and what their experience with the company/car was like? From what I've managed to read, they sell ""lemon"" cars... Although this has been known to happen at even reputable dealerships when it comes to used cars.    

[I have a budget of $5k cash that has to include sales tax, temp plates, title, etc. If anyone can even point me in a good direction, that'd be cool too. :)]    

**Edit:** Thank you to everyone that's responded! :D I will take your guys' advice and check AutoTrader biweekly as well as Craigslist daily. I'll be sure to take along either my dad or close friend that are both knowledgeable about cars. And I'm going to keep looking until I find a car that my wingman and I find reasonable and suitable for me, being a first-time car-own and all. :)

I declined my other acceptances because UA's tuition for AZ residents is much cheaper. Unfortunately, I was recently labeled as an out-of-state student which increases my tuition dramatically. By the end of 4 years, it will be approximately an extra 80k.

Here is my situation: I am listed as a dependent on my parents' joint taxes. My dad cares for my siblings, cousin, and grandmother in Arizona. We've owned a house here for 3-4 years. He works full time as a high school teacher and has been paying AZ taxes for 4 years. My mom lives by herself in California and pays California taxes. I have not held a job in CA for the past 2 years and I graduated from UCSD (a Californian college) in 2011. Since then, I have attended community college in Arizona to fill the rest of my pre-reqs and I was established as a resident student by the community college based on dad's taxes. I also have a job in AZ as well as a drivers license here.
Is it legal for them to classify me as an out-of-state applicant? I called them today and one of their major claims was ""well, you went to UCSD as a Californian and you cannot have residency in two states."" That's because my Californian residency was based on where I lived in HIGH SCHOOL. Things have changed since. My chance to repeal is in June. Do I have any chance? What items should I bring besides my repeal form and tax proof? Does it matter that my dad makes more money than my mom when the benefits are included? How many years of tax proof do they need? Is it going to hurt me that the address listed on the taxes is my CA address? We did our taxes in Arizona but my mom listed her California address.

Someone please help. I really can't afford the extra 20k per year. I wouldn't have declined all my other pharmacy school offers if I knew this would happen. I was reassured before I accepted the offer by a University of Arizona residency classification employee. He told me, through email, that I would be considered a resident as long as I was a dependent on my parents' taxes. I brought this up today and the other employee said that the guy lied and University of Arizona is not held accountable.

""My bike was stolen today in downtown Tucson, sometime between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. I was parked in the parking garage underneath the main library in an IMBA logo-ed Subaru Crosstrek. The bike was on a Yakima rear hitch rack, the thief cut the cable, likely with bolt cutters or similar. Here is a full description and some photos attached. Please keep your eyes open, as it may turn up on a trail, at a trailhead or in a bike shop. 

Yeti SB66, medium frame with a couple of IMBA stickers, turquoise. Fox 36/Kashima fork, Fox RP23 rear shock. DT Swiss wheels, Continental Trail King rear tire (little bit worn), Schwalbe Hans Dampf front tire (little bit worn), KS Lev dropper post, WTB saddle, Thomson seat collar, SRAM X7 shifter, SRAM X9 rear derailleur, Gamut chainguide, SRAM X9 cranks (1x10), Time pedals (well used), Shimano XT brakes - a noticeable feature is that I run them reversed/Euro/moto style - left lever is rear, right is front, Truvativ stem (black, very short), Race Face Atlas bars (blue, wide, 780mm), ODI lock on grips.

Our friend Jon, the local SRAM rep has offered some SRAM schwag as a reward for it's return, which is very generous. I'll add a bottle of Irish Whiskey to that reward, and a bottle for Jon too. If you have any info, Jon and I will get these rewards to you. Please spread the word, forward this email and photos to your friends, post on Facebook, forums, etc. Please feel free to post my contact info (below) too. 

Thanks, Patrick""

The only problem is that I've heard the cost of living in Flagstaff is high, and that the job market is not great. So if I'm trying to save money before going to school, living in Flagstaff doesn't seem like a great idea. Are the living conditions in other cities pretty much the same?

I'm not really interested in moving into the Valley, or other big cities - but I would be more open to the idea if that would be my best option. I would like to stay somewhat close to Flagstaff, as I'd like to ultimately end up there. I've been thinking about Prescott, but would that really be a better option than Flagstaff?

",13,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/evnsb/az_towing_companies_evil_or_eviliest/,"So, /r/arizona, I thought I'd share this delightful little tale of my NYE. I was at a friend's house in Chandler. We were enjoying ourselves, celebrating the new year. I got a little tipsy, and asked my sober friend to give me a lift back to my place. 

I left my car parked on the street. I saw no sign that suggested I couldn't do that. ***IF*** I had seen such a sign, I would've parked in my friend's driveway, where there was ample room. I didn't see the need.

I arrived the next day to retrieve my car and it was missing. Chandler PD informed me that the HOA in the neighborhood had it towed. The tow yard is about to charge me $300 to release my car. 

I was trying to be a good citizen, avoid drinking and driving, and as a result I wind up having to pay a $300 ransom I can scarcely afford to get my car back from the bastards who effectively stole it. 

What can I do about this? Turns out, not a hell of a lot. Had this been Tempe or Glendale, I might have some legal recourse, but Chandler and Mesa don't have any laws that regulate towing. Even in the cities that do have such laws in the valley, they are regularly skirted and ignored by unscrupulous tow companies (Monster and SWAT, I'm looking at you.) 

The state legislature passed a regulatory law last July requiring appropriate signage, capping towing fees, etc. Our dear, sweet Governor Moron vetoed the legislation. 

I figured I'd share this with you all in the hopes that this can serve as a caution at the least. If you live in Mesa/Chandler/Any city that doesn't have ordinances, perhaps it would be good to write to the city council. I would also urge you to write your Congresspeople and Governor Brewer, and let them know how you feel about it. 

You can better damn well believe I will. As I see it, the Governor owes me $300. ",,False,,t5_2qn1z,False,,,True,t3_evnsb,http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/evnsb/az_towing_companies_evil_or_eviliest/,

I got familiar with the classes I needed to take, the level of competitiveness in the field, etc. However, I'll be moving to Arizona next month, and I'll be finishing my education out there. However, I'm completely clueless, so I'm wondering if anyone could help shed some light on the college system out there? For instance, how competitive is the nursing field? In California, many universities don't even accept nursing majors into their schools, because there are far too many. Is this a problem in AZ as well? Can an AA in nursing get you a job in most hospitals, or are the majority of places expecting you to have a BSN or higher? How expensive are schools, on average? What are the best schools for nursing? Anything else you think would be good to know..

If it helps, I'll be living in Maricopa Couny; the exact location is undecided yet, but hopefully somewhere close to Luke Air Force Base.

I moved away from AZ in 2009 when I was 15. In the middle of high school, it was a tough time. I had to move to Atlanta, Georgia for my dad's job. All of my family lives on the West Coast [except my big shot uncle who lives in Florida], I was against the idea. I quickly found the South to be a bit too judgemental/materialistic for my liking. [Rant begins] I'm not bagging on the whole area, but the area that I lived in has a huge goddamn issue. So racially divided, it made me appreciate the melting pot of Phoenix [not the restaurant :)] where Mexican kids get along with the white kids. Where outdoorsy fun times don't involve dressing in golfing Polos and douchebag clothing. The South is not for me.

Now that I have graduated high school and have gotten my core college classes out of the way [at a nice local University], it was time to start thinking about transfer schools. I am an industrial design major and a quick google search reveals that ASU is one of the top ID schools in the US. Oh the irony, I knew at that moment that I needed to move back. 

I am in the process of compiling information on payments, tuition, and living to present to my father. He is very difficult to please, and I have decided to put together a Powerpoint presentation to formally present my plan. If all goes well, he will approve, and I will be back home for school, with friends and family. This has been a rough ride, and I have learned a lot. It's been an educational experience I am proud to have endured. But honestly, right now, I just want to be back in my warm desert.

Here are my questions. 

Does anybody know of the best priced living accommodations around Tempe? I am looking for something of low price, and of somewhat decent shape. Best bang for the buck. I plan to search around myself, but I hope some of you can provide some personal experience that google can't. Any advice would help.

Anything about living in Tempe that would be valuable to know. As a native to the Ahwatukee area, I am unfamiliar with the city, my father went to ASU, but i'm sure things have since changed. Again, friends have been able to provide only so much. 

It seems I can't think of anymore questions, so this is it. Thanks for reading Arizonans, I hope to join you all [you all, not ya'll] soon.
