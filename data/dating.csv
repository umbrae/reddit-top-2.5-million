I have had good success with mending them through time and TLC, but it isn't that kind of thing you want your relationship predicated upon.

That being said: talk of desperation, your foreclosed home, babies, and wrecking your car certainly does make you look vulnerable... and you are unmistakably beautiful... but you are a Rembrandt in bad decision-making.

1368718565.0,41,self.dating,1egexp,Why courage is better than confidence...,46,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1egexp/why_courage_is_better_than_confidence/,"Confidence is universally recognised as one of the most attractive traits a man can possess. You’ll be very hard pressed to find any dating adverts by women looking for men lacking confidence. However, I would argue, based on my experience, that there is one quality that women value more than confidence.

That quality is COURAGE.

Confidence can be defined as “A feeling of assurance, especially of self-assurance,” or, “The state or quality of being certain.”

Meanwhile, courage can be defined as “The ability to do something that you know is right or good, even though it is dangerous, frightening, or very difficult.”

So, it would seem that the difference between confidence and courage is in certainty; confidence contains certainty whilst courage does not. Courage often involves stepping into the unknown, into seemingly dangerous or frightening situations.

Why then, if courage is lacking in certainty, would it be a more attractive trait than confidence?

Because courage represents the willingness to take a risk whilst confidence does not. Confidence, as valuable as it is, still operates within the realm of safety. It operates within the realm of the known. This is part of its beauty because it allows a definite outcome, but it is also its limitation because it cannot operate outside the realm of the known. In order to step into the unknown it takes courage!

A man who operates only in the realms of safety and the known doesn’t have the willingness to take a risk. He only takes the calculated risks that he knows will succeed, which, ultimately, are no risks at all.

A man who is prepared to step beyond the realms of the known for what he believes to be right and good will take any risk, and consequently his capabilities are limitless. This is the man who has courage!

A courageous man has the capability to approach any woman, in any situation, should he feel compelled. He knows not what the result will be.

A courageous man has the willingness to express exactly how he feels without any veil of insincerity. He knows not what the result will be.

A courageous man has the openness to be fragile or vulnerable or weak, even when it is expected that he should be solid and protected and strong. He knows not whether this will mean he is perceived favourably or unfavourably.

Courage opens up the doors to infinitely more possibility than confidence. And ultimately, women do not want to be limited by a man who only operates within the finite arena of confidence.

Don’t believe me?!?

Go out and ask some female friends if they’d aspire to be with a man who is afraid to express his emotions, who is afraid to be vulnerable, or who is afraid to be real and true to the intimacy of telling it exactly how it is. They might settle for a guy like this but it certainly isn’t what they aspire to.

Women are dying to meet real men. Men who are willing to step into the unknown. Men of COURAGE!

What does this mean practically?

It means don’t be afraid to express yourself if it feels right.

It means don’t be afraid to be in touch with your emotions if it feels good.

It means don’t be afraid to reveal your vulnerability in order to protect your ego.

Ultimately, it means don’t be afraid. Or, more accurately, whether or not you are afraid, take the actions that feel right and good in abandonment of protecting your ego.

Don’t expect that you have to be confident at all times. When confidence is absent courageousness takes over. Be courageous!",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_1egexp,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1egexp/why_courage_is_better_than_confidence/,

As one of his tweeps said ""I wish I read this when I was 15.""


Umair Haque is London-based consultant, author, and economist. He is also a contributor at the Harvard Business Review [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umair_Haque).



Gathered from his twitter page:

1. If you like someone, ask them out. Don't suffer in silence.

2. If you ""like"" people purely because of their looks, you're probably insecure and you're going to have a miserable love life.


3. If you're not being yourself on dates, you're not going to have a miserable love life. You're not going to have a love life.


4. ""Rejection"" is a dumb word for a dumb idea. Don't take it personally when you don't click with someone.


5. Don't idealize people. We all have crushes, but the truth is you'll never have fun if you're a clingy needy pedestal-pusher.


6. If you can't seem to meet people, it's probably because you're boring. Go to some classes, talks, shows. Be interesting.


7. If someone doesn't like you back, move on immediately. Don't cling, don't pine. Life's short, and people are many.

8. Don't ever (ever) try to convince someone that doesn't like you ""why"" they should. You'll feel worse. Find someone who does.


9. ""Attractiveness"" is a stupid myth. People are drawn to people who bring out the best in them. So be one.


10. You're going to get your heart broken. If you're lucky. So stop protecting, start accepting.

11. Finally, not always being happy isn't a reason to end things. But if you're constantly, really, unhappy, break up immediately.



Some other side tweets written by him:

* There's a difference between how a person makes you feel, and how you think a person should make you feel. Don't confuse the two.

* Go to the gym. Get a sense of style. Not because society expects it, but because you'll look and feel better.

* Don't ever compare yourself to generic ideals of ""attractiveness"". We are all hot when we have the confidence to see ourselves as so.


* So you have to open yourself to the surprising possibility of people--not just what you ""want"" from them--if you're after love.


* So just find people you really think are cool and interesting and let them know. The more you idealize people, the unhappier you'll be.

I'm a 30 year-old guy. Reasonably attractive, successful, smart, funny, own my own home, all that jazz. I think i'm a pretty good catch overall. I've been in several long term relationships throughout my adult life, but I have problems meeting women and establishing relationships. I mostly resort to online dating which, relatively speaking, has yielded poor results.

I have a 7-year old son that resulted from a one night stand when I was 23. He lives with his mom and I see him every other weekend. Her and I are civil, friends, she's married and everything is cool.

Be honest: how much does this screw me over in the dating scene? Would you ever date a guy in my situation? I've been on dates with women where I would tell them this, and they would almost get a look of disgust on their faces. Quite often when I do get responses from online dating sites, it's something along the lines of: ""I don't date guys with kids"". It's EXTREMELY disheartening because it's hard enough to meet people as it is.",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_1ccxcy,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1ccxcy/ladies_im_a_single_dad_how_fucked_am_i_on_the/,

I'll throw some info out to the Reddit Powers That BeeHive.  Maybe I'll get some interesting responses.

So again, 25 years old, male, Caucasian, brown hair, green eyes, 6'0"", fairly skinny but fairly athletic...sounds like your typical Redditor already, right?  Let's differentiate.

I'm a humanitarian at heart; I'd be happy to protest on the streets for/against something if it meant some positive change.  With a Master's in Social Work, I get a lot of satisfaction out of meeting with different people and trying to work with them on their problems.  Right now that means mental health counseling; if that leads to non-profit work in the future or a completely different job, I see myself as being able to have fun with variety in my work while serving a greater purpose.  

Naturally, politics is another passion.  I'm a liberal Democrat, not a centrist.  I think we need to actively work to get better progressives into government in order to move change forward.  I'm talking New Deal, Civil Rights Act, single-payer insurance kind of change, and it can only be done if we have both houses and the White House.  

Of course, if I only focused on that, I'd burn out fast, like any human being.  I like to balance my time equally between training for triathlons and quality solitude (reading, meditation, 'puter games).  I also do volunteer work with the Sierra Club and hang out with local Freethinkers meetings whenever I can.

While I'm not actively arty, I'm a arts lover.  I've been a film buff for a long time and will happily talk about good TV with other fanatics.  Joss Whedon, anyone?  How about Darren Aronofsky?  Bonus points for name-dropping Scott McCloud.  Talking about Community will always get my interest.  That said, I'm open-minded.  If you mention something I haven't seen before, I'll be happy to check it out.

Some random thoughts:  I'm humanist/atheist (Buddha/Jesus were probably cool historical figures.  Probably not supernatural beings.).  Fast becoming a Joss Whedon acolyte (currently working through Buffy S6/Angel S3).  Pugs are the best breed.

My career and lifestyle do create a fairly busy schedule, which hasn't left much time for dating.  I'd like to change that.  If you think you're fairly like-minded and/or equally passionate about these things, go ahead and message me.  If you just want to talk about random stuff, go ahead and message me.  I won't bite.

TL;DL:  Did you see The Wire?  Holy shit, we should do something about that.

Location:  *Currently* South Dakota.  I'm also in the midst of deciding where I actually want to go for my career, so this might change in the next year.

Hey, if all I get out of this is some fun 1:1 online messaging, that's cool.  I'm posting this in the spirit of experimentation to see what happens.  I'm also willing to edit this post from good feedback, so if you don't think I should mention *that* part of myself yet or if I'm unintentionally throwing out a con, feel free to say something.

As I was with her, because she stayed up the entire night with me talking over skype even if she has school or work early the next day. Lets me grow out my moustache, has shown interest in the things I'm interested in and is attempting to get into things to be closer to me. Shares writing as a passion, is good in the sack in her own special way, enjoys much of the same music, and has gotten me into things I never would have gotten into otherwise. She's always been faithful to me, even after I've made stupid mistakes, and she has this smile. It always makes me feel better.


And this is important. I've had a few long distance relationships, with women much closer to me, she is easily the farthest away I've had a relationship with. 

And she is the only one who actually came up to visit me. She spent hundreds of dollars and flew over 500 miles to spend two weeks with me. After we had been talking for three years, and she had the choice to come up for my birthday or hers, she chose mine. Then she let me be her first. After 20 years of saving herself and meeting some great people, she gave herself to me and when we slept together, wrapped in eachothers arms, it was the first time my mind felt at ease, the first time my anxiety dulled and my first real peaceful sleeps in a long time. 

So why exactly would I not be with her? All in good time, lets focus on some bad things.

My girlfriend was nice, but she was kind of possesive, thinks getting into videogames as much as I have is silly. Wasnt into the same sports I was, got angry at me a lot, yells at me for no reason, broke up with me constantly, wasnt a comic book geek like I am, wasnt as free spirited sexually, lives in a different country, has a different religious belief and might not be the prettiest girl to a lot of you and doesnt get a lot of my jokes. 

But, most importantly. 

I asked her the most important question I have ever asked anyone, and she looked at me, and smiled that smile.

And thats why I'm not with my Girlfriend anymore.

I'm with my Fiance.

In the past I've done the ask the girl if I could kiss her, and another situation we just sort of ended up on topic and I told her I wanted to kiss her. In both situations it worked, but I always feel like that is the pussy way of doing things, not what girls want? Is it better to just steal a kiss so to speak, and surprise the girl with it? Of course assuming I feel she's remotely interested, I wouldn't try and kiss someone I felt I had no chance with.

A little background on my situation.  I lived with my last girlfriend for two years.  I was planning on proposing to her within the 3rd year, and she did a total 180 on me and stopped caring about the relationship.  Long story short, I ended up breaking up with her and she moved out.  This occurred in September 2010.


**Online Dating Woes**
Since then I have healed myself (I think) of all the emotional attachments and have been on a LOT of dates with girls from OkCupid and Match.com.  I have lost count on how many...but it's probably been at least 35 dates first dates and out of that I have had two second dates.  Most of the girls just weren't for me and there were plenty where I'm sure I wasn't for them.


**My Background**
I'm a 27 y/o introverted guy that can hold a conversation quite well.  I have my socially awkward moments, but I can be very outgoing.  The introverted nature just has me exhausted at the end of the day if I'm around a lot of people or have to speak with large groups.  Overall, I feel like I'm a pretty normal dude.


I have only a few close friends that are all married and have kids, which has severely limited the option of having them set me up with someone.


I'm an old fashioned guy that is quite chivalrous and I'm wondering if it's too outdated for the dating scene now.  It seemed to mean a lot more in my early 20's, but I'm feeling like not a lot of girls care about that anymore.


**Next Steps?**
Online dating just isn't for me.  I've ran into a lot of crazies on there and I don't think I belong on the sites.  My previous girlfriends came from people I knew or I knew the girl from school or work.  The work thing can be iffy because it can create awkward moments, but it's also hard to find a girl within the IT industry.


Any ideas on how I can get out of this funk?  I feel like I'm stuck for some reason.  I'd be happy to share stories from my online dates (a lot of crazy ones, just like other people on here).  If you need any other info, feel free to let me know.


TL;DR: I've been on dozens of online dates that didn't work and I'm looking for tips on meeting women that are not from a website.

The title begins to describe my dilemma. I am of dating age, and I usually date guys that are older than I am for a few reasons. I've been in the dating world for a while and seem to click better with guys that are older than me, and I have a pretty decent career already and like to date guys that are kind of on the same page as I am. No offense to the dudes my age with no idea where they're going or what they want out of life, I'm just in a different spot. 

Anyhow, I've always been a fairly independent, self-reliant person. This is always a good thing until I'm on a date and the bill comes up. I always offer to pay for my half or to switch off on who pays, even when I start dating people. I feel like this has effects that I don't even mean for it to have. Possibly emasculating, unappreciative, insulting, or like I don't want to be courted by the guy, not sure. Maybe they feel like I don't believe that they're capable of providing for me. However, I don't like feeling like I owe the guy something, like I'm being bought, or to make him feel like I'm using him to get food or drinks or activities. For some reason, I feel like this is a problem especially for the older guys [~30] that I date. I feel like splitting things makes me feel more of an equal than anything else, and I feel like this shouldn't be a problem. I've recently started seeing someone and I've tried to offer a few times to pay for things, but he pulls out his card before I can, and we're awkwardly standing at the register with two cards out and the cashier ALWAYS takes his. 

Any advice on how to pay my own way on dates without offending guys or being obnoxious? I really do appreciate the gesture, but I don't want it to be a regular thing. Just feels weird to me.

I think we can all agree that dating sucks donkey balls for everyone involved. And I think one of the reasons that it is so unpleasant is because for some reason, everyone has issues with being upfront and honest. 
 
For once, can we all agree to put common human decency and courtesy in front of our own personal comfort? If you aren't interested in someone be honest about it. As uncomfortable as it is to say a few words, it's 10x more uncomfortable to be the person on the other end wondering why the hell that girl/guy isn't answering. 

And for the people who (unfortunately) get rejected: do the same thing. You aren't off the hook either. If/when that person is upfront and tells you the cold hard truth, thank them. Don't be an asshole. Thank them for doing something they didn't want to do. You might not like the answer, but at least you know the truth. And then the cycle will continue. 

I make a point of doing this and people genuinely appreciate my candor. I have received really cheerful (and appreciative) replies from saying ""Sorry, I'm not interested."" And have made friends out of it.

We would flirt and play around occasionally, have interesting conversations, and then I decided things had gotten to the point that I should ask her out. 

So I did. 

She said she was busy. Something about having to go to her brother's soccer game that Saturday. I said ""no worries"" and went about my week a little disappointed. 

Yet we continued to flirt nonetheless. 

The week after, we had begun to talk more. Things escalated a bit and I found myself asking for her number. She happily complied. Everything is going smoothly, we're having a good time, I casually ask her out again and this time she says yes. 

Only to cancel the day before. 

""Oh, something came up and I don't know if I'll be able to. Don't worry though, I'll let you know.""

At this point, I'm not sure she's actually busy. That's twice now. 

Minutes afterward, as I'm sitting next to her, talking normally in a seemingly flawless attempt to hide my disappointment, she decides to lay her head on my shoulder for the first time. So by now, I'm thinking ""okay, she might actually be busy. I'll just wait for her to get back to me."" 

And she didn't.

I started to get to know her, not only through our conversations but through my buddy as well. Her parents divorced when she was 6 due to an abusive, alcoholic father. She grew up rebelling against her mom for refusing to allow her to see him. 


 She has made some mistakes in life but I have seen her make an effort to turn her life around. She is now a month pregnant and is trying her best to get ready for this coming child. The father of the child is a coward and completely out of the picture. Her mother kicked her out of her house for her efforts in meeting her father for the first time in 12 years. 


 She has confessed to me that she wishes she had never made some of the decisions she has made. She also confessed her interest in me. I was only able to tell her that I was not ready for a relationship or to be a father, and that I could only pursue a friendship with her. She accepted. 


  I havent stopped talking to her since and iv'e found myself really getting into this girl. I feel her winning my heart. She really is a good girl. I just refuse to believe that I'm falling in love with a pregnant girl. Iv'e struggled through the years growing up not only saving myself for marriage, but also to make sure I never ended up having to be responsible for a child at a young age. Now I'm here.
Yesterday I had to remind her that we could only be friends. It hurt me so bad, as I know it hurt her, too.

 Am I just infatuated by her? Am I in love? Do I forget about my plans and take this child as my own and fight to make a family with this girl? Do I continue to push her away? 
I haven't know her for long but I feel like I do. What do I do? Am I being stupid for even considering raising this child as mine? Am I being stupid for allowing the child to be a factor?

I'm not your typical Redditor or Texan. I don't game much, don't like guns, not into country music, and can't name a single meme if my life depended on it. I do however like to be a normal person and enjoy the simple things in life like getting out and checking out the sites, movies, pool and/or bowling, and drinking a few brews with good company. To be honest I'm not looking for the coolest, funniest, or hottest person to be with. I don't need to be impressed. I just need you to be you. Well I also need you to like me being me.

* Asian
* 5' 6
* I'm near the Dallas (DFW or whatever you call it) area
* No kids
* I live on my own and I can support myself just fine.
* I'm like any NORMAL guy. No tattoos, no piercings, and no frou frou haircuts.
* I don't put on bad boy, hunk, or cute image.  The closest way to describe me is that guy that always get friendzoned.

I was a very shy guy in high school and probably asked like 2 girls out ever during that time. The rest pretty much had to throw them selves at me for me to get the hint. Now on to my subject title, the answer is you should never ask a girl out via text or facebook. Are there some girls who would be ok with it, probably but that is the minority. The reason not do this is very simple....


Confidence... If you ask any girl what shes looking for when a guy asks her out, this will be the number one answer. Now obviously you dont have it if your thinking about asking a girl out via text or facebook and thats ok. You dont need to have confidence you just need to know how to fake it. If you ask a girl out like ""So, I was thinking of maybe going to the movies this weekend and I was wondering if maybe you would come with me if your not busy?"" your implying that your unsure if you really want to go out this weekend, your implying that she probably wouldn't want to go with you and your also giving her an easy out by assuming shes busy. This does not portray any confidence what so ever. In fact its like the anti-confidence way of asking out a chick. If shes really really into you and you have been missing every sign then ya she will probably say yes anyway but thats usually not the case. So what would be a way to ask a girl out with confidence? Simple, know what exactly you want to do and assume her answer will be yes. For example: 


You: ""So Jenny did you see the trailer for that movie 30 Minutes or less?""


Jenny: ""Ya that looked like it was pretty funny!""


You: "" Ya it did,  we should go see it this weekend!"" 


Or you can just one line it like: "" So Jenny I really want to go see 30 Minutes or Less this weekend and I would love for you to come with me."" 


In both those situations you just made a definitive decision of what you want to do and implied that you know she would go with you. Girls hate when guys are indecisive. The worst thing you can do is pass a choice back onto a girl if she asks you like "" So where do you want to go after the movie?"" and you say ""I dont care its up to you"". Always make the decision, if she really doesn't want do it then she will most likely tell you. The second part of assuming she would go with you is how you are faking the confidence. It lets her know you arent putting her on a pedestal and that it would be her lucky day if she went out with you. 


So if you guys like my advice then let me know and i can write a few more pointers for you guys.",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_jhsau,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/jhsau/for_all_those_guys_asking_if_they_should_ask_a/,

Still have some of it but considerably less. Anyway i've always had the problem of becoming TOO involved in the lives of girls I liked. I met this latest girl at school toward the end of last semester and I thought we were hitting it off. I messaged her on fbook to follow up with a talk we had had earlier in the week and she asked if I wanted her number. I figured, why not? Ended up texting her pretty much every night and thought we had something going. She introduced me to her guy friend during an event but I didn't connect the dots that THEY had a thing until they started dating a few weeks ago, which was after I had asked her out and gotten a nice no.

I have no problem with them dating. He's a nice guy, totally chill, and as far as I can tell the total opposite of me when it comes to attraction. He just doesn't give a fuck. 

The problem is that I still view her as a friend and I wouldn't have asked her out if I didn't. I continued texting her into the summer about random shit and all of a sudden she stopped returning my texts. Her boyfriend is our only mutual and he went on vacation around the time she stopped texting me.

Anyways, I'm friends with her on facebook still and I basically look to see if shes on when I text her and to check out what stuff she likes and comments on.

Her response was one of ambiguity; she said something to the effect of, 'there are too many variables and I don't know if we'd work out/ I don't think it would be smart.'

I guess my question is, is this just a nice way of saying that she wouldn't even consider dating? Is she in limbo? Im really out of my element here. I'd like to pursue this but I'm not sure how to go about it now. I mean, mom didn't raise a quitter here, but I don't want to be that obnoxious guy.

I wasn't free over the weekend, but he suggested that we meet on Thursday as he has Friday off work so we can go for a drink. We'd sorted that yesterday and have been having a generally friendly/bantery text conversation, with him asking a few questions about me and so on.

On the surface of things it seems like he's keen, but I haven't heard from him in 24 hours (I was the last one to text). He seems like a genuinely decent guy who's not just purely after sex (could be wishful thinking but I tend to know when they are). 

I just feel like a bit of an idiot as he's basically ignored a message from me. Plenty more fish and all that but I don't understand why he was all keen one minute and now there's just radio silence!

Can anyone shed any light on this? I'm not just sitting around by my phone waiting for him to text but I feel more and more stupid the longer it gets! ",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_1cvwlw,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1cvwlw/guys_why_the_sudden_silence/,
1366599651.0,10,self.dating,1cua3f,Would you date a biracial person?,15,5,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1cua3f/would_you_date_a_biracial_person/,"So I know there is this big stereotype/fetish of mixed race people being really hot and desirable but in practice, would you actually date one? I'm mixed myself and I find the issue of my race to be hurting my dating chances.

To get to the point, I am conventionally attractive. 5'8"", long dark hair, hazel eyes, but I don't really look black or white. Most people upon meeting me assume I have some sort of Hispanic background, or it becomes a game for them to guess where I'm from. I've gotten Egyptian, Moroccan, Brazilian, Persian, Mexican, Greek, Native-American, Italian, tanned Caucasian, and a host of others.

Once people find out I'm part African American, it's like something switches in their head. Sometimes they apologize, like my being black is offensive or that they've discovered a dark secret of mine. And if they were somewhat interested before, they suddenly back off. I've gotten this from white, Asian, Indian, and Hispanic guys (I don't live in an area with many black people, so I don't think I've ever been approached by a black guy). I've never sealed the deal after I've been 'outed' and so it makes me reluctant to ever divulge my background.

I don't think people are consciously thinking 'that girl is not my race, so I will not date her' but I feel like there is something in that, since I don't fit into a particular look, no one sees me an potential partner. It's ridiculously frustrating and I'm at the end of my rope.

Online dating is even worse. Along with all the rude messages twenty-something girls normally receive, my interactions also take on a weird racial element. One time I was chatting with a guy through OKC and he kept making racist jokes. (His opener: Horse walks into a bar, bar tender says, ""Why the long face?"" Horse replies ""My wife is fucking a black man."") I wasn't offended, but eventually he says something to the effect of 'How would your father feel if you were dating a black guy?' I responded that since my mother is black, I doubt he would care. The guy freaks and says he thought I was Hispanic. Then he signs off.

My dating history is pretty pathetic anyway, but I was wondering if other people had thoughts on this? Do you approach visibly mixed people in a bar? Does discovering someone's background instantly turn you off? Should I just dye my hair blonde and pretend? I'm curious to hear other people's experiences.

A couple of weeks ago I in fact did ask her out and as it turns out, she always thought of me as such a good friend and was open to such an idea :D

We decided that it seems like a good idea and it looks like this could develop into a really fulfilling long-term relationship.

I'm not looking for karma. I just want to help those in doubt and let them know that I, who was once in that situation, was able to succeed where I thought I would fail. 

Keep looking up. If you think that girl is right for you, go for it!

A couple of problems: 

-I'm more emotional than regular girls. I can manage it fairly well, but it's something that's going to be there.

-I have issues around sex that I'm working through (I was molested as a kid and sexually abused as a teen, so I have a lot of fear around it...my ex would often get very upset and yell at me when everything would be going fine during sex and then all of a sudden I curl into a ball and start sobbing). I know it would take me a little while longer to have sex than most people my age (I'm twenty) because I want to be able to trust someone before I sleep with them so that a situation like that DOESN'T happen, or if it does, they don't get extremely upset/angry over it.

First reason: I was going to focus on myself for a while
Second reason: Mostly because my last few girl friends were crazy, cheated on me, or lied to me a lot. 

I've been healing after the line of heart ache after another after another and I think Im ready to start dating again, however Its been a while and I am quite shy and usually keep to myself (until you get to know me).

Anyway does anyone have any advice on how to get out there or something I dont know how to get into the groove again.

(yes I know this is a weird question)",10,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/wnihf/help_can_anybody_explain_to_me_how_to_kiss_how_to/,"Hi, I am an older female who got out of my only real LTR recently and is now trying dating for basically the first time in my life. (mostly on OKC) So, it turns out I ace the first 1 or 2 dates and then it dies in the 3rd because I cannot deal with the kissing stage. Basically I just hate kissing. I do not know how to do it, and fundamentally I do not understand why people enjoy it. The funny thing is, I really love sex (I especially love giving blowjobs!) - but you kind of have to go through the kissing stage to get to the sex. What is happening is that on date 2 or 3 the guy starts trying to kiss me and I try to go with it but it just feels sort of... weird, icky, suffocating, wet, just basically not a pleasurable sensation, and, most of all, way way way too intimate too soon. Anyway - I try to gut my way through it, just cannot stand it, start breaking off kisses / dodging kisses, and of course the poor guy gets frustrated and thinks I'm not into him and it basically dies right there. 


I should probably explain that I was just recently diagnosed with Asperger's and that that is probably the root cause. I guess a lot of aspies are hypersensitive to touch, and don't enjoy casual touching. Here's the thing though, I've already managed to retrain myself on practically everything. I spent most of my 20s and early 30s studying people, studying body language and conversation, and I tried to sort of re-wire my brain on all kinds of stuff. And I succeeded! I am really social now. I learned how to do small talk, I can look people in the eye, I can crack jokes, I am GREAT at making friends now, I can hang out (the ""How to Hang Out"" puzzle took me probably 3 years nonstop study to crack. I was super proud of that one). None of my friends know I am an aspie and they'd be shocked if I told them. But the one thing I have not been able to solve is flirting/dating and especially the kissing. I can get through the 1st and 2nd dates using the stuff I learned about how to make friends. But shifting gears from developing-a-friendship to developing-a-romantic-relationship is utterly beyond me. I cannot read flirting cues and most of all this kissing thing is turning out to be my Achilles heel. I cannot figure it out.


I KNOW it's possible for me to learn social stuff like this from scratch if I can just get some guidelines to sort of map my way through it and learn how to think about it. So I have two questions: 


**(1) WHY DO YOU LIKE KISSING?** What about it is appealing? Why is not just icky/suffocating/wet?  

**(2) How do you actually do it?** How EXACTLY does the first kiss get started, what's the hints/cues, and then what exactly do you actually do? How long does it last, when do you stop, how do you break it off, and then, on subsequent dates how often/when is the kissing? Do you just kiss constantly all the time once you've got started, or when you greet or before sex or what exactly????

I am feeling really discouraged and would really appreciate any tips.

Maybe I can help you out.

When someone puts their a/s/l to have a date, it can happen two things, it can work (but the odds are few) or it will be ignored. Why? Because there is no effort, it seems just a desperate measure and that's not an interesting thing.

How about for example saying:

Hi, I'm a guy from Florida, I love surfing and I'm looking for someone who wants to join me! Pics inside!!

Or if you say: I'm a girl from Chicago, I had had bad luck dating! But I haven't give up! I want to meet guys that are normally friendzoned!

Or whatever, just be original and put some effort or imagination. What I really want to see is people trying to do things different not expecting something just because you did a small step. For a big change you have to things different, without fear, just do it! Not only here but also in real life!!

Talk to the girl, talk to the guy, don't go with someone just for their looks, get to know yourself first and that way you will know what you really want.

If you want someone pretty, put some effort on your hygiene, your looks, maybe your clothes, do the things that you expect your future S.O. to have or do. 

My main concern is that you people meet the people you deserve, but for you to deserve them you have to put your ass to work!

I've known Ali for the past 6 years, but I've only made casual conversation with her maybe once every 6 months. At the start of this year, I came to know she was taking AP Psych in the library, at which time I was also taking my AP Lit class. 
     We hit it off from the start, and I've grown to have a crush on her. I didn't know if she liked me or not, and after someone made a joke about her being my girlfriend, she didn't comment on it, only seemingly pretended not to hear, but I know she did. I'm 99.96% sure this is her saying ""Why won't you realize I like you and take the hint, thickskull?!"" on the inside, but shit, I don't know. 
     I didn't tell a soul about my liking her until I told a mutual friend that despite the class sucking, I do like talking to her, and my friend responded with ""That makes me think you like Ali, so I'm just going to tell you straight up that she likes you. Just throwing that out there."" 
     Aww yeah. Best feeling ever. Now then, I honestly don't know what to do now. I haven't dated at all in the past 2 years (being socially awkward sucks &gt;.&amp;lt;), and I am venturing into uncharted territory here. Do I ask her out? She can't go to Homecoming, and neither of us can drive yet. My driver's test is on the 13th of next month, and I should hopefully have a car not long after that. I can use my parents' on the weekend, I'm thinking. 
     But, I digress; how should I ask her? I don't even have her cell phone number yet :3 and she's very bust atm with soccer, and I don't even know how. Can anyone help? Thank you for reading my ramblings thus far.

I've only been in two serious relationships, one terrible, and one great but short.  I've also have been friend-zoned too many times.  I'm one of those guys that say a lot of dick and ball jokes when with his buddies, but is also known to listen to peoples problems no matter how inane they may seem.  I'll be the guy that when a female friend feels like shit, they talk to me.  A couple of times, I've convinced myself ""Hey, maybe this could happen between me and her"", only to be told ""We are just friends.""  Because of these failures I've had, I hold back on acting up on my feelings or what my friends sometimes believe to be missed opportunities.

So, the times has come for me to ask of reddit, if they believe this to be a missed opportunity, like my friends believe, or that I have no chance.

Here goes.  There is this girl I've known for a couple of years now.  By known, I mean that we have spoken ever so slightly every time we meet through a mutual friend.  Every time it has been extremely pleasant for the both of us.  I make her laugh tons, and she makes me laugh too.  We honestly have always had a good time whenever I'm around her, and the other way around.  However, it wasn't until recently that we actually started talking to each other outside of just when we meet through our mutual friend.  However, these aren't that common.  Once, she went to my apartment, just to hang, and we ended up going out to eat, and had a great time.  She flirts a bit with me here and there, but then a lot of times, the topic of conversation convinces me that she isn't interested.

One of the things she talks to me about with frequency is how lately she feels like being in a relationship.  She says how she has never been in one, but she has always just been dating around.  So far, so good, right?  Well... she then starts talking to me about some of the guys she is currently attracted to...  See, from here on out, I start to feel like she isn't interested in me at all.  My train of thought is ""Why would a girl talk to a guy she is interested in about another guy?""  Which to me sounds like a pretty convincing argument.  

Anyways, as time has gone on, I keep getting mixed signals.  For example, when I talk to her through online chat, she barely ever answers.  Sounds stupid, but hey, I'm fragile.  But then, when she came to visit my area, though a couple of way closer friends live nearby, she stayed with me.  In my bed.  Even though her closer friends offered, and were viable options, hell probably even more comfortable options.  That to me was a HUGE sign.  I don't know reddit.  I'm a mess, this is a girl that I've been crushing over for a while, and the more I get to know her, the more I like her, and the more mixed signals I get.  Please help and lead the way.  Do you think I may have a shot at asking her out without messing the friendship?

And yes, this is a throwaway account.

Any help would be much appreciated

Well I've had the good fortune of getting laid on the first date with the last 3 girls that I met online. Unfortunately none of these really went anywhere, and I'm actually looking for a lasting relationship and not just sex. I'm considering flipping the script if this happens again and being the one to hold off a few dates before sex.

I have a theory that when a girl sleeps with a man on the first date it changes her self-perspective and she doesn't like it and wants to forget it ever happened by not seeing the guy anymore. This last one, she started assuming I don't want to see her again just because I had to leave early the next morning to do some work on a Saturday. (special circumstances, but she wasn't hearing any of that...) Basically her self-image seemed to cave in and insecurities just ruined nearly every conversation after that.

I've met a girl, invited her to drink some coffee and we had a great evening talking about stuff. Basically we were talking about 4 hours, and the next day I called her and we talked for another hour on phone. I've got to really like her and would try to get to know her better (long-term aims).

So, I need an advice on these questions (sorry, I'm a total newbie when it comes to dating):

1. Should I ask her directly if she has a boyfriend? I'm worrying that she could be thinking of me only as of a friend. 
2. What kind of questions should I ask on the second date? Should I start asking some more private questions or simply follow the natural flow of the conversation? Again, I'm worrying that if we start talking about common interests again - I'll become a friend and nothing more.
3. Basically, is there some way to see/ask if she sees a potential boyfriend in me or not? I mean some way not to scare her.

Over this time we have been very friendly but not really that close. I dated her friend for a (very) short while who I had liked for ages but then realised that it was a bad idea and ended it.

I was pretty melancholic after that whole ordeal (6 months or so) and the girl helped me through it since she knew the exl best. Ever since then, we have been very close but don't always see each other that often since her university is too far for me to visit. We text each other flirtily and skype maybe once a fortnight for hours at a time, usually staying up late just to talk even if she has early classes.

So my question is:
Would it be a good idea for me to profess my liking to her and risk our friendship? I'm worried that if I do it might ruin the friendship :(

Edit:
Additional info: she isn't going away to college full time. She comes back into town every w/e and for the holidays.

Background: Been in a stable relationship for 9+ years. Now it's been over for nearly half a year and I'm starting to look at girls again, but I'm not interested in anyone special nor looking for anything romantic.

All I want atm is a lover or two, perhaps a friend with benefits or just one night stands. AKA sex, making out and flirtatious dating with no or few strings attached and little crying when we part.

Problem is apart from the 9+ year relationship I have very limited experience, and as such I'm a confident, non-virgin noob. I have absolutely no experience with flirting with someone who I'm not already in a relationship with, much less dating or bedding. I'm not even sure if what I describe above is at all socially acceptable.

Before my long relationship I would look for girls that I fell somehow magically in love with. Now, that hasn't happened since (it might, at some point), and that also makes it hard for me to choose who to approach. Is it OK and acceptable to approach someone you could very well have sex with or go on a date with, but don't feel much towards? Is this completely out of bounds for friends? For strangers? If you want casual sex, do you fake feelings until it's over and then part - or do you straight up say all you want to do is press her up against the wall and slip a finger down her crotch?

This is my first post here :P

I just kind of have a problem at the moment, so allow me to explain.
I've always been kind of an awkward guy, but came out of my shell a little this year. I've got much more friends now, and people generally think i'm funny.

So about 2 months ago, I met this girl. Let's call her Stacy.
Stacy was a very cute girl and I really liked her.
We talked a lot, both IRL and on msn, and always had a great time together. She really did display all the 'classic' signs of liking me; lauging at jokes my that aren't even funny, touching me, asking for hugs when I had to leave, and liking my facebook pictures.
So after a while I finally asked her to go for a drink sometime.
I was so nervous, I must've re-typed that 3 sentence message a thousand times. But she said 'she'd love to!', so we had the date today.
What was planned as a 30 minute drink became 3 hours of non-stop talking and laughing on both sides. We had a great time, shared funny stories, and just had a lot of fun. I gave her compliments, and she gave compliments back.
In fact, seeing that i'm still kinda awkward, i thought I did amazing -no awkward silences, no jokes that didn't land- and was high fiving myself by the time we left. 

So we biked back together, and before she had to leave, I told her that she I had liked her for a long time, and asked her if she'd like to be my girlfriend. I basically was 99% sure she'd say yes.

But she just said: 'I'm sorry, but..' and I said I understood, and left.
Can anyone tell me what I did wrong?
I'm pretty sure it wasn't a 'pity date', because IMHO she was in my league. She also did not have a boyfriend or anything.

I've never had a proper method to pick up girls, and my dating life shows it. I went to some PUA forums, learnt some tricks from The Game, I knew that there were things that made my chances of getting a girl better. I tried to change that, I tried to learn, I made some changes in my persona (small ones, really) and thought about it now and then.

A few months ago I had drunken sex with a girl I met randomly. She is nice and I've been kind of dating her since, nothing serious, and as shallow as it may sound, I think I can pick up hotter girls.

I asked a different one on a date the other day, she initially said yes, out of surprise, and then cancelled, I learnt then not to startle them, there must be a proper way of doing these things.

I had a good night yesterday, I got the phone of a cute and funny girl, and I don't want to propose her on a date and botch it, and obviously I'm not going to back off, I want her to be mine.

So, this morning, the pieces came together, and I think I got the complete plan. I humbly ask the community of lover masters of reddit to review this long writing, and give me their view on it. I'll use it to get a proper date with this lady, I'm going to know what am I doing this time.

The text is too long to fit as a single submission, so I'll one example story as a reply to fit everything in.

**Stages**

There are six stages in your relationship with a girl:

1. Contact: You notice the girl
2. Entrance: You start talking with the girl
3. Familiarity: You two get to be comfortable with each other with people around
4. Dating: You two get to be comfortable alone
5. Intimacy: You two have had sex once or more
6. Stable: You are in a monogamous relationship

It doesn't matter which stage do you want to arrive with the girl in question, all these stages need to be traversed in a sequential way. To change from one stage to the next, you need to:

* Change scenario
* Meet the intimacy level
* Use an appropiate span of time

The girl needs to feel that you two have moved to a higher stage, although that will happen only in her subconscious. To achieve that change feeling the most effective way is a change of scenario, which leads to a change of intimacy, and sets you to pursue the objectives to reach the next stage. The difficulty of each of this stages peaks between Familiarity and Date, and once you reach Intimacy the girl normally will lead the way, blame the genes, but your part of the game is until you have sex, then it is her game to get a stable relationship. That's why my writing only talks about getting laid, I like stable relationships more than one night stands, but I never had that much difficulty from sex to stable.

[Please find the story on the replies below]

You went through the first 5 stages with Elisa, using three days of a period of two weeks. If you paid attention you saw Contact stage (you see her at the desk), Entrance (supercactus! cows and banjos!, also coming back in the afternoon), Familiarity (drinks with the workmates), Dating (sculptor's party, and then balkan's party, and then dinner date), and Intimacy (you have to play football, what a sad excuse to drag her in). 

**Timelines**

There is a maximum and a minimum for the time you can spend in each stage, and you will probably be aware of this already.

* Contact: 0 to 60 seconds (maybe less)
* Entrance: 1 to 10 minutes
* Familiarity: 10 minutes to 3 hours
* Dating: one evening to several days

If you don't spend enough time, your chances decrease, because you look needy. 

* In Contact there is no minimum time, and I recommend making of it a reflex act to pass to Entrance. Just say hello to every girl that catches your fancy, don't think. You should have a few prepared chatlines that you can use for any girl (or guy, this is good for making mates too. It's very nice to be friends with the random people you meet during the day).
* In Entrance you look desperate if you ask her to come along before at least having a laugh with her, I mean, you don't want her to feel that she is anybody. She needs to give herself a reason to come to a different scenario where you will happen to be.
* Familiarity, she won't come with you after ten minutes, unless you are really a pro. She comes with you because she knows that she is going to have fun, that is what has happened before.
* In Dating, she needs to know that she can be alone with you and still have fun. For that you need to be a time in the Familiarity stage and isolate her, so it gets proven. You also need to have physical contact, and that takes time or it looks forced.
* Finally, for her to have sex with you and go to the Intimacy stage, you need to make her want it. Girls normally take her time to warm up to it, so here you need to have a little of patience, keep and escalate the physical contact, and get her involved by changing scenario.

If you spend too much time, your chances decrease, because you show lack of confidence.

* In Contact you start looking like a creep, and the girl sees that you lack confidence and rejects any further moves.
* In Entrance you will run out of chat lines and jokes, you need to move a bit deeper to have enough conversation to sustain you for a few hours span.
* In Familiarity, you risk getting too familiar. That is the dreadful friend zone. She has had fun with you for a long time and she doesn't want to lose that, she is not in for the sex. It's best to become intimate friends around the same time that you start having sex.
* In Dating, there is not that much risk of her losing interest, unless you lose the physical contact and go back to Familiarity. She is dating you, so she marginally wants to pass to the next stage. You are showing what you would be as a stable partner at this stage. Still, there is no reason to risk it now that you have spent so much time.

The second point regarding timelines are the game breaks. Every time that you lose contact with the girl for the day, you will go back a good deal, which will be easier to regain the next time. With Elisa, when you left the sculptor's party and she kissed your cheek you had already physical contact, but she won't hold your hand in the next party for a while, so you will have to redo part of the job. After the balkan party you have a proper date, but although the phase is called Dating, actual dates happen from the middle of it, the first middle is spent securing the stage change from Familiarity, isolating the girl. After you have done almost the whole of the dating stage you can start from the middle of it next time with a proper dinner and dance one and change to Intimacy.

**Scenarios**

You will notice that to change stage you have changed scenario, and sometimes you have used several scenarios to build up to the next stage. The first scenarios were very casual, and possibly completely random. Not so the parties with your friend, sometimes he calls you to take a girl with him, sometimes you do it, you both have agreed to accept the other along, even going a little bit out of your own way if that is necessary. You have a couple of friends with this kind of relationship, which help every one. The Dating stage is all about having possible scenarios to take the girl to, like parties, restaurants, fun places (bowling! bingo with the old ladies! irish pub with folk music, concert venues).

There is not much to it, scenarios are just a tool, and you need to be aware that you need at least one for each stages. Each extra one helps you get the girl focused on you two as a couple, and it is a powerful tool.

**Objectives**

It's handy to have the objectives that separate stages quite clear, and that there are mid stage ones too.

1. Contact: Talk with the girl.
2. Entrance: Make her laugh. Agree a common ground where you can have time with other people around.
3. Familiarity: Again, keep her laughing. You need to make physical contact (holding hands in a casual way is perfect). The final objective is for her to be comfortable with you alone in a non-sexual way, because she is having fun.
4. Dating: You need to make her want to be alone with you from the start, get a proper date. You need her to kiss you (much better than you kissing her). Have something to take her to your apartment if she doesn't take you to hers.

Everyone is aware about the objectives of dating, the trick is realising the milestones that will take you to a proper date where she starts to pull on her own.

**Tools**

There are plenty of tools for each stage, I recommend The Game, from Neil Strauss, and getting to PUA forums, but never take it too seriously, it needs to be fun.
Have a set of greetings to start conversations, make a habit of asking things, think on questions you can make to keep the conversation going, think of questions to get more information on the girl, learn some dancing, whiten your teeth, get a man haircut, learn how to dress, learn about perfume, learn how to play an instrument, make friends that know where the good parties are, learn about restaurants and become friends of the staff in a couple of them, same about bars, stock your own bar, have movies at your flat, casually carry a camera with pictures of you doing things, get a wingman or two.

**Outro**

If you have read all this, I really thank you. I came to reddit because specialized seduction forums can be a bit creepy, and I know that between the nerds and the pun-masters, there are a lot of normal, intelligent people here. I've made a new account to mark the change of personality I just had.

If this changes the seduction skills of anyone for better, please let me know, I'd be most happy :)

I'm still young so I understand there's no rush and everything and also due to my age I'm limited in age brackets. Women generally want to date older guys and I don't really want to date someone who has just turned 18 so my bracket is basically 19-20.

Despite this I'd like to believe I'm an attractive (I'll post pics if needed), athletic, funny (I can get a chuckle/belly laugh out of anyone I meet) educated, tall (6ft) guy who has passionate hobbies ( I'm a black belt in karate, I play the guitar and do gardening). I don't live with my parents: I have my own place (which isn't run-down or anything it's nice and by a river). I pay my bills and I like to follow politics.

Maybe I'm sounding arrogant but isn't that all the cliché qualities women want out of guys?

I've never been able to date a single woman though. All I want is someone who is in decent shape (they don't have to be a marathon runner I'm happy with love handles or stick thin) and being able to talk to me about interesting topics rather than celebrity gossip. I'm not a ""boob  guy"" or an ""ass man"", I will admit I like an attractive face but generally speaking just being clean and well presented is fine. 

Now, at this point I'll admit I'm perhaps a little picky. I'm the sort of guy who will judge whether I'll date someone not on their cup size but on what degree they've done or are studying and at what university they're doing it at. I'm just genuinely attracted to intelligent conversation.

Am I being prejudice by basing presumptions on university? Perhaps, but my opinion will change quickly once I hear what you're interested in. Too many people in my age bracket seem to think ""partying"" is some hobby they should be proud of...

Negatives? Well , I guess as well as my hobbies I'm also an avid internet user and do a lot of computer gaming. Maybe this leads me to not having enough time to do other stuff where I can meet women, but where would I meet them? At a club? that's not really where I'd feel I'd find what I'm looking for... I can also be a bit abrasive, I don't mean to it's just the way I write and talk (as you can tell by this post).

Maybe the fact that I'm writing something like this means I'm desperate and people can pick up on that. I'm not sure on that and maybe I could work on it.",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_1hxsmt,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hxsmt/21m_i_just_cant_find_anyone_interesting/,

1371966465.0,3,self.dating,1gw9y6,Some thoughts about dating that confuse me,7,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gw9y6/some_thoughts_about_dating_that_confuse_me/,"I'm greatly confused with the ""norms"" of dating (23; from the US).  Many aspects of it don't make sense to me, and I'm hoping some of you might be able enlighten me.

**1)** ""Games"".  From my perspective, for anyone who I find (physically) attractive, I would automatically go on one date with them.  Then I evaluate their personality, and if there's not a good match up between the two of us, that's the end of it.  If there *is* a good match-up, then I continue the dating process until there's either some unresolvable difference or I end up married.  (Not looking for an eventual marriage?  That's absolutely fine and normal, but let me know fairly soon, because you aren't my type then.  No need to waste each other's time by withholding important information like that.)

But I'm learning this isn't the way many people think about the dating process.  Instead, you have to play this little social media dance involving Facebook and texting and ""hard to get"" and other such nonsense, and for what reason?  I have no clue.  It seems like a waste of time to me.  Either there's potential -- in which case, go on a date -- or there isn't, in which case, both parties need to let the other know there is no chance and move on.  It's emotionally draining to fritter about wondering what the other person is thinking, and I don't like ""drama/emotion"" anyway (as long as there's starving children in the world, I have no time for ""dramatic"" dates).  Just be straightforward and say what you're thinking.  If we could all read each other's minds, I imagine relationships would form much quicker and last much longer.

*1a)* As a little aside to this point, I don't understand how people (mostly girls I've noticed) ""change their mind"" positively about someone.  I've never met someone I didn't initially want to date and later think ""You know what?  So-and-so's actually pretty awesome; I think I want to go out with them.""  That just doesn't happen to me.  How is it then that a lot of people seem to develop an attraction?  I mean, I guess if the person was overweight and then they got in shape, I could see how, but a lot of time there's no physical change.

**2)** Friend/date separation.  Peoples' complaints about the friendzone have long confused me.  My parents have been happily married forever and get along better than any other couple I know.  They both say they are each other's best friend (i.e. you marry your best friend).  So I don't understand this strange division nowadays between someone you'd date and someone you'd just be friends with.  For the latter, I understand there may be people you want to be friends with but aren't attracted to, but for the former, why on earth would you date someone and not be close friends with them?  It's absolutely puzzling to me.

**3)** The sex obsession.  Alright, I'm sure it feels great, but it may be one of the least important parts of the relationship to me.  I care much more about personality, intelligence, and even physical beauty than anything sexual.  Yet it seems as though nowadays relationships (society as a whole?) are built entirely around this concept.  Is my brain really so much different than the norm with regard to this? (I'm a guy too, which I suppose makes it even weirder.)",,False,,t5_2qhb1,1371966657.0,,,True,t3_1gw9y6,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gw9y6/some_thoughts_about_dating_that_confuse_me/,

I was saying things such as living at home is great because you always go home to people who care about you. She replies ""I care about you, just not love you"". I'm freaking out because its been awhile since I have felt this about someone and don't want to fuck it up. We are going to go get sushi in a couple days and she ""said"" that she will be coming over soon to make cheese(yeah, we are dorks) with me.  How should I approach this. I will try to answer questions to my best abilities

Additional detail
She is definitely a step up from me.  People say to just act like a dick but I don't want to be someone I'm not.  She is super religious(I used to be) and Chaldean so her older brothers don't like her hanging out with white guys(like myself).

My degrees are English Literature and Creative Writing. I've written for a newspaper, done submission reading for a literary journal, waited tables, worked for a 911 mapping project, sold computers at Best Buy, worked at a used bookstore, tutored, consulted, taught. But I have not and will never be a prostitute. Or two prostitutes. Or even half a prostitute unless there's some weird scientific experiment or tragedy or something.

I like Doctor Who and old PC games (think Baldur's Gate or Bookworm Adventures or old Nintendo stuff). I have pictures and people say I look like Elvis and Ted Mosby and Charles Manson and Josh Groban. I used to like cookies a whole whole lot. Now I only like them sort of. Healthier eating habits I suppose. But I am skinny, so that probably accounts for some of it.

I play the baritone and I marched all through high school and partially through university. For a long time I had undiagnosed ouchy disorder that made me all hurty when I used my feeties and I was miserable and limped. Think Dr. House. The parallels were uncanny. Both our problems started in 2003/04 and mine went away in 2010. Now I'm mobile and happy and, dare I say, at least appear normal until I start talking.

I have good hygiene, shaving and brushing and flossing and showering. Not really a pet person but not opposed to them. I won't start a war with your dog, for example, unless your dog is belligerent and tries to invade my country. Don't do that, dog.

I don't like hot dogs. Trying to get away from eating meat.

My brothers once dared me to eat a whole Bigfoot pizza for $5. I didn't finish it but they paid me anyway.

When I was put in my class, there was this one girl that caught my eye. She's not all that good looking but she's confident and intelligent. She's very cute too. All these attributes make me want her. There's more too.

She's in my circle of friends (clique) and there are 4 guys and 2 girls in this group. We have gone out as friends more than once and I have talked to her a couple of times. Seems like I can really talk to her when its only the 2 of us. However I do notice that with other people around us ( excluding the clique) she doesn't really talk to me. She talks to some other guys sometimes in a situation where there are many people.

So I am confused. Is she interested such that she is shy and does not talk to me when there are others around. Or she just doesn't talk to me then. I'm unclear. The other guys that she talk to (outside clique) aren't any better than me.

In one of our convos we talked about photography. So I asked her if she would like to go out with me and some of my friends for a photography outing. However she said it would be weird cause she would only know me. So I suggested that I ask one of my other friends to bring a girl along. She however still wasn't sure. 

So I am wondering, tomorrow is the last day of school before the term break holidays. I would probably ask the clique to go for dinner after school where I would ask her for her number. How should I go about asking her knowing she might see me as a friend? 

After I get her number ( I will, just want to get it the best way) , when do I text her or call her about the photog outing? ( Assuming  my photography friends have already planned the outing)

I would take the outing as an opportunity to learn and spend time with her, and to make room for more time 'dates' with her. So basically I have to execute it well. 

What do you guys think I should do? Also, do you think that it would adversely affect the clique if she realised I'm into her.

I can be painfully shy at times but once i open up I can be really energetic, I can be a little excitable at times as well I don't think its a bad thing but it can be a bit unexpected. I also like to think I am a very lovable person. I can be very child-like (not childish, very different) bout how i react to things i enjoy passionately. 

Also i like to believe I am above average in the smarts department. Enough so that I even feel pretty okay with talking about things as advanced as theoretical physics with someone. 

I'm a total geek. 

I can be kind of girlie but I'm also a bit of a tomboy. 

I have a really dry sense of humor. l speak fluent sarcasm. 

I can be really distracted at times but other times I can give entirely devoted attention. 

I will randomly break out in dance. 

I can be really stubborn at times. sometimes even a little aggressive if you insult my intelligence or things I enjoy. 


I can be playful &amp; cuddly too! 


That's really the best I can think of right now. There is more to me but a lot of it is just more detailed explanations of what I already said. All and all I think I'm a pretty interesting individual. Kind of like a kitten. I'm not entire sure what I'm going to get into next.

1352770974.0,6,self.dating,133isp,Need some serious help and advice here lads.,6,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/133isp/need_some_serious_help_and_advice_here_lads/,"Okay so I need some advice. I've met this girl and I'm crazy about her, can't get her out of my mind. I'm totally inexperienced so am struggling on my own and thought Reddit could help so here's the full story as I know it.

I'm 18 year's old, soon to be 19 and recently started University studying Games Programming (Started in september). Before University I barely left the house, I had friends but they lived a way away so didn't see them often. I have literally NO experience with girls.

So when I started Uni I met this girl, I thought I already knew her a bit from college but turned out to be her identical twin. Anyway, in the first week my flatmate starts inviting his friend (a girl) around who knows and brought with her the girl I now like. For the sake of this post I'll refer to the girl I like as Bob (Blackadder fan here, pluss a bit drunk while writing).

Anyway me and 'Bob' get on well straight away as the whole misunderstanding about knowing her twin at college kind of breaks the ice. Through the first couple of weeks at Uni Bob and her friend start coming over our flat all the time and this becomes our little group. We started to all sit in my room as I have the best entertainment stuff (xbox, tv, bluray, etc.) and me and Bob would often sit on bed. She started to put her legs over mine (like lying down sort of thing) and I would rest my hand on her leg. In the fourth-ish week we're in this position and by this time we've started touching each other allot. 

I take all the touching as a signal as I have no experience so I lean over and kiss her on the cheek to show that I like her. She didn't really react at all just kept staring at the telly so I said ""was that wrong for me to do that"" and she calmly said ""No, it's fine"". Anyway, that night after I walked her and her friend home (do this every night) I texted her on the way back to my flat saying that I was sorry if I did wrong but I was really nervous and was worried I messed things up, she said something like ""nah it was fine, just go with the flow. A kiss isn't going to mess anything up"". So a little while after that we were all at her flat and me and her were sat next to each other on her bed. 
We had gotten very close (sitting close to each other) and were holding hands and stuff, she looks at me saying something and then starts kissing me, we end up kissing for like an hour while everyone is in the kitchen making food. People came back in and we were just laid against each other, she had her hands all over me. 
The night after we were all out again at a bar for pool-night, she hadn't mentioned anything about the night before so I asked her if she ""regretted last night"" she looked at me quizzically and said ""last night?"", I said ""Yeah, were you drunk or something?"" and she laughed (nervously) and said she was I said ah ok (I probably looked visibly upset). I said ""Do you remember US?"" and she asked again ""Us?"" and I said ""well yeah, we were like kissing and stuff on your bed"" she said ""no sorry"" and I again probably looked very upset. She said ""I think we just need to give it more time, we've only known each other a few weeks"". I said yeah I understand. Anyway, fast-forward a couple of weeks and me and her on her bed again, I was going off the advice of a friend who advised me that I would get 'friendzoned if I didn't show her I had some balls"". So that night I had my hand on her inner thigh and then I kissed her, she looked at me and I said ""Sorry is it still too soon"". She said something like either ""I don't know what we're doing"" or ""I don't know, what are we doing"". But I just kissed her again and she starts kissing back, we keep kissing for like an hour and I try to make a bit more of a move because of what my friend said, I put my hand down her pants and she looked at it, I said sorry is that too far and she said ""no it's just I haven't shaved"" I said I didn't mind and carried on, though I couldn't do much because her jeans were tight and I started to try and unbutton them. She stopped kissing and looked down, I said ""Is that too far"" and she said ""I'm just thinking about the time"" It was 1am and we both had lectures at 9am. So I went home, on the way out I kissed her goodnight and said ""Sorry if I went too far"" she said ""don't worry about it"". 

Anyway the next night we were both home for the weekend, I texted her asking if she had enjoyed last night because I was worried that I was a bit too pushy. She said ""Yeah it was fine, just think we best off being friends for now as we don't really know each other"".

I took this really hard and off another friends advice didn't text anything back apart from ""I need to be alone for a bit"". And she said ""Oh why?"", I didn't respond so she said ""You ok?"" I didn't text her back.. Anyway, I went home the next night and got really drunk because I felt so bad. I sent her a big long text explaining that I was crazy about her and I was sorry if I went too far"". She said that ""It was fine, I just think we're best off being friends for now as we don't really know each other, something could happen in future"". So I said ""Okay, I thought it was something I did or that you liked someone else"", she said ""Nah it was nothing you did and there is nobody else"". I said ""Okay, well I'm sorry for trying to rush things. I can wait until we know each other a bit better"", she said ""It's fine :)"". 
Anyway all this week (That all happened last weekend) we have been talking on Skype each night from like 10pm-2am. Two nights ago she was over mine again and we were both on my bed right next to each other. I thought she was trying to hold my hand so I moved my hand closer to hers (touching her finger tips) and she started to hold my hand. We held hands all night. 
Anyway, tonight I was talking to her friend and she said that she asked her about it and apparently 'Bob' said "" She tried to get her hand away but couldn't"" then her friend asked her if she liked me and she apparently said she wasn't attracted to me. But her friend had recently told me that she could tell that 'Bob' definitely liked me and that she got all nervous about me when she brought it up. But tonight they all came over and I wasn't really sitting next to her. 
After they went home EVERYONE went on Skype together. I went for a walk with a backpack full of booze and got pissed. She was texting me asking where I was and to cut a long story short, I came back and went on skype, told them all I went for a walk because I like the cold but she said ""You should have told us where you were going"". She was texting me warning me not to go wandering off on my own as it was dangerous. 
¬¬¬¬¬¬
Anyway I'm really confused. I am absolutely crazy about her and want things to work out. She's going away for a week tomorrow so won't see her until next Monday, though she may go on Skype. I don't know what to do. My mate keeps telling me that she is messing me around and she isn't all that great and that I should give up. I don't want to though, I really need help here guy's, please.

this is the question I've been wondering for a long time. Let's say a girl has a very important and very hard exam and I know about it. I really do care if she passes it or not. Is it good to ask her about the outcome or should I sit quiet and hope she will tell me about it herself?

I've read lots of times that you shouldn't ask such stuff: if the girl wants to tell you - she will by herself. If she does not want - you will make her uncomfortable by asking. However, it's very often that this becomes very weird. For example: each day I'm encouraging her to study, calming her down when she's nervous about it, etc. Then exam happens and... I'm suddenly all quiet about it? 

Sure, exam is only an example, but it had happened to me several times and I still have no idea what to do in such situations. Should I show he maximal support and care after the event (I really want to do this), ask ""how did the exam go?"", receive ""bad"" in response and forget it; or be quiet hoping she will tell me herself?

I've read many times that a guy should not give advice to a girl when she's telling about her problem, as she does not require an advice but only someone who understands her feelings. However, I'm not sure what is the right way to do this, as I'm actually used to give advices all the time.

Let's take a simple example: girl tells about her week-long conflict with her mother and that she is very nervous about it. 

What is the best thing a guy could say?

1. Tell her 'Everything is going to be alright' or similar stuff. (Sounds kind of dull)
2. Tell her 'Everything is going to be alright, because all parents love their children, so whatever the conflict she still loves you, etc. etc.' (Not as dull as previous one)
3. Same as 2 but in addition add a story like ""I once had a long time conflict with my mother ... ... but it the end she was happy to see me again"" (This is what I choose to tell).
4. Some other reply?

Again, this is a sample question, I simply can't understand what kind of answer girls appreciate the most. Or if all of those responses are good, then what kind of response would be bad?

Thanks in advance.

1313362494.0,4,self.dating,jisrg,Got a number for the first time; little lost,4,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/jisrg/got_a_number_for_the_first_time_little_lost/,"Hello /r/dating - I need some advice. Here's what's happened so far:

On thursday, I went for beers with a good friend I haven't seen in a while. One beer turned into a few beers, and I started chatting with our server. I ended up getting her name (and naming her favourite drink after her), and then having quite a few more drinks. I'm really terrible at flirting, so I basically just told her ""order what you like, and I will try that"" for most of the night.

Our server was super cute, and I decided I'd like to get to know her better - so over the course of our drinks, my friend and I tried to figure out how to determine whether she was single or not.

The most covert method we figured out was to ask her when the bill came ""Hey, we're trying to settle a bet - he thinks you're single, I think you're not. Which is it?"". Turns out she was single!

Here's where it gets a bit weird. She'd been giving us the bill when this happened, and she wandered away - but no less than 10 seconds later, she came back and asked ""so, do you guys just bet on the ugly ones, or..?"". I fell all over myself saying ""no, no - he's more of an optimist than I am, and I think you're cute"" (or at least, something along those lines - the memory's a little hazy).

As we sat and considered our drink tab, a different server came and dropped off two more drinks - ""compliments of the bartender"" (who we never interacted with - just our server).

Because I was paying with a debit card, I had to go up and have her ring me through - so I did, and while it was all going through, I said ""Hey, I'd like to get to know you better. Can I buy you a coffee sometime?"". She thought about it, smiled, and said ""Sure"". At this point, my drunk self went ""great!...but I'll need your phone number to set it up. Can I have that?"". She gave me her number, and joked about whether I'd remember it in the morning - to which I responded ""I will text it *right now* so I don't forget"". She laughed, and then went back to work while I grabbed my friend and we headed out.

This is the text I sent her:

""Hi &lt;cute server&gt;, this is &lt;my name&gt; - I would like to buy you a coffee sometime. Let me know when you're available!""

That was thursday night, and I waited all through friday to see if I'd get a response - nothing. On saturday, I figured it was probably okay to call - so at 2:20, I did. No response - and I learned she doesn't have an answering machine, which means I have no idea whose phone number I actually have.

I tried again today at 1:00 or so - no answer again, and no answering machine either. I sent her this text:

""Hey &lt;cute server&gt;, &lt;my name&gt; again - I've been having trouble reaching you. Is there a good time to call? I'm going to give it one more try tomorrow - alternately, if you'd like to call me, you can reach me at &lt;my number&gt; anytime.""

..And that's where I'm at, now.

If I still get no response tomorrow, I'm not sure what to do. I'd *really*, *really* like to get to know this girl better in a context where she isn't serving me liquor, and I'm not even sure I've got the right number. What should I do?

Also, as an aside: one friend has recommended going back to the pub one night when she's working, but *not* seeking her out (just making it known that I'm there). At that point, he says, she'll either approach me and talk, or ignore me completely - and then I'll know completely and for sure.

I guess what I'm saying is - I'm not sure what to do here. What should I do?

It was still pretty early, and as I was reached her house she was like 'Do you have to go home now or do you wanna hang out'?? I was like sure, so we sat in my car and talked for little more than an hour and I felt like we really bonded too, anyway she eventually had to leave because it was getting late.

I was like shit man I gotta act upon this. So I waited 2-3 days and called her (after overcoming epic anxiety ofcourse) and it went somethign like this 'Hey, what are you guys doing today' and she was 'Nothign everybody is busy' so I was like 'do you wanna do something' she was like 'sure'.

I picked her up at 5, went to dinner and a movie and were done at like 9, were underneath her house by like 10. and again we hung out until 12ish before she had to leave. And during the date she said 'That I should pick the next movie'

What sux is that we had finals for the following few weeks, so i had no chance of seeing her then. We talked a couple of times on the phone then, but planned nothing. so we finished a few days ago, so I decided to call her again today and asked her what her plans were (hoping to get her to go out again obviously) and she replied that the entire group was doing X and that I should come.

Now, this makes me wonder: was I just a member of a group of friends who happened to be free when everybody else was busy or is there more to it?",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_hv0qi,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/hv0qi/was_it_a_date_or_were_we_buddies_hanging_out/,

I'm posting this as an update up top. A friend tried to arrange a blind date, with only a little being told about the other person. I work behind the counter at the library. She stopped by, and I recognized her because she said she was working on a photography project, and that she wanted to take candid photographs of people for the project, the same phrasing she used in a phone conversation we'd had.

She left, and then I got a text calling off the date.



Original post (With some edits):

I've been told my standards are too high by some women who I've gone on a date with, that there isn't anyone on earth like what I've described, not anyone single at any rate. All I did was describe myself, yet I can't seem to get a date.

Basically, is it wrong to want someone who's slightly nerdy, wants to take care of someone, is kind and has a nice smile (okay, that last one isn't me), and isn't fat/greasy, by virtue of either working out or playing a sport or just minding what they eat?

I thought I had a pretty good personality and a wide set of interests, yet I've never had a girlfriend where I've asked them out and had them say yes. It's always been some girl just creeping on me super-hard and me just shrugging and going ""well, it's not like there has been anyone else in about a year now, so... I guess it's you who I'm going to invest my energy, time, and money into."" In the end, it comes out that there's a reason I wasn't really chasing them in the first place, and it falls apart because I'm not that interested.

It sucks that I'm not being given any choice in who I date, that it's entirely their choice, and given a choice, with all but one of my girlfriends, I'd have picked someone else at the time who I was interested in, and every time, they had already shot me down.

I've tried out just about every method of asking someone out- I've tried the complete stranger method, the casual acquaintance ones, and many friends of mine or friends of friends. Even blind dates have said no to me before meeting me. Online dating has netted me no one. Most telling was I recently asked out an acquaintance. Her eyes went wide, and her head shook back and forth violently, as quickly as she could make it as she goes ""no. No no. Uh... no..."" as if I were threatening her or had just offered to take a knife to something she loved. She seemed legitimately scared of my offer to care for her. I'm not offering them my heart, I'm not desperate to the point of ""HERE IS MY HEART NOW TAKE IT DAMMIT!""

I've had a couple one-night stands, but most of them I found out later they had a boyfriend. I know better than to try and take what is someone else's, and I call it off after that. He who takes by cheating in a relationship, loses by the same method.

So recently an acquaintance from high school wished me a happy birthday on Facebook. (She once came up with a few friends to visit me at college for a weekend which she remembers as an awesome time) I took the opportunity to message her and pick up the loose thread and got invited to a happy hour out with some of her work friends last Thursday. That went really well, I made everyone laugh, bought a few rounds and had some one on one chat time with the girl.

We share a lot in common, I'm all Italian, she's mostly, very similar upbringings and parents etc. It felt a little like she dropped a few hints like ""oh that sounds like a funny dvd we should watch that sometime"" or ""next time we do this"" (as in the happy hour), etc. I'm not amazing at picking up the flirt hints. Now most of our convo the prior week was on Facebook messages, but she texted me that day to let me know the happy hour was on. 

The honest truth is that I'd like to get to know her better in a more one-on-one setting. I'm not getting all worked up over this girl but I do want to find out if she's more the type of woman I'd be interested in dating.

just wondering what you guys think I should do in this situation.

so i was at starbucks last night. one of the girls who was working behind the counter was really sweet to me a few months ago, like around summer.

basically, when i saw her last night, i said ""hey, i don't know if you remember me, but a few months ago, you gave me some really good service. i was having a rough day that day, and I wanted you to know that you really brightened my day back then.""

So I said this, and she was smiling, and blushing. I then turned to kind of walk away, and she said something along the lines of ""oh you should come back and see me anytime. I am always here!"" I replied, ""maybe i'll see you around.""

my question is, would it be creepy if I went back there tonight? i was there last night for work, and I am able to work from home again... so i have an ""excuse"".

I'm 34F, living in NYC. I'm here for a little advice and encouragement: I'm hard of hearing and don't know how to approach this ""issue"" with men. 

See, I DON'T want to make it an issue. I'm an independant woman with a great career in New York. I friends back home, I made new friends here (read: not anti-social), and of course I have an amazing family. My hearing has never stopped me from doing things. Not because I don't let it, but really because it hasn't. You know? 

Well except recently. I've been wanting to date again and it's my first time at online dating. Suddenly this situation became a puzzle. So help me out here, if you want.


If you were a guys on a dating site, or a friend of a friend. When would be the best moment for me to tell you that I wear hearing aids? Before the date (with the risk that you'll turn me down) or after our first date (so that you get to see that I'm a cool girl)?

Finally, would YOU date a girl with hearing aids? Is that a major turn off? Is it scary?

I don't want to be labeled as a ""hard of hearing person"" but I want to start dating again and I want to be up front about it. That's part of who I am and I decided that at 34 year old, I need to embrace it.

I got a few responses but I definitely could use some more opinions so I figured I'd post it here too. Here it is :

Here's the situation: I graduated middle school (junior high) in 2007. I was kind of a weird kid back then and didn't really understand the saying ""think before you speak"". Anyways, after middle school I went to a high school pretty far away and haven't talked to 99% of the kids from middle school since I graduated in 2007. A few months ago I was looking at my friend's list on Facebook and noticed one of my old middle school classmates. For some reason I started getting really nervous and it feels like I have a huge crush on her. Now, mind you, I haven't communicated with 99% of my middle school classmates since June of '07. We're all in college now, all around the country and the only way of reconnecting with them during the school year is Facebook. I have them all friended on Facebook. Like I said before, I was definitely an awkward, kinda crazy, stupid, arrogant kid back in middle school and I think I left that impression when we went off to high school. I feel I need to rebuild my social stigma(?), social reputation I guess. My question is, how do I approach reconnecting with this girl and my other classmates from middle school? I'm worried they'll think I'm the same weirdo kid with a big, arrogant mouth. I've talked to 1 person already and it's gone great. However, I feel talking to this girl seems like a shot in the dark. I'd appreciate any feedback or advice with this situation. Thanks!

TL;DR I want to reconnect with old middle school classmates, especially a girl I have a crush on, they're all Facebook friends, how do I approach this?",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_1i6ulu,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1i6ulu/19m_looking_to_reconnect_with_a_middle_school/,

But I'm a gamer! That's not what I want! I just want to play some games and stuff and get to know someone.

So I figure why not just leave some **un**identifiable info about myself, and if there are any matches interested, send me a reddit private message and talk about how to go from there as slowly as it takes to gain trust. Play some steam games together or whatever over the next year, and we'll see where we are from there.

I don't know how well it'll work, but I'm trying to be optimistic. Even doing this is hard for me.

---------------------------

*About me*

I'll be looking for a female with these following similar traits, histories, and level of education. So as you read this, I'm hoping for the same, with some leeway on which degree you took (I'm hoping an engineering or science degree) or what color hair, of course, but I do want to stay close to my age range by one or two points. I'm white, male and twenty seven years old. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I was *raised* christian in the conservative christian south of the US, but my education has pretty much left me an agnostic both politically and religiously. I mostly play PC games now on steam. All my features are brown. So hair, eyes, and all that. As said before, I like to talk quietly, I'm not a very loud and vocal person. I'm also not very outgoing. I don't like talking face to face. I tend to look down or away while talking like a person with Aspberger's Syndrome, which I think I probably have in a small dose.

So from that, I think anyone can tell that I'm not going for a christian conservative relationship.

If I had kids, I would teach them about all forms of science. Not just one branch of science. So that they can think for themselves. I would not be interested in going to church every time the doors are open like my parents raised me to do.

I avoid confrontations. I like to think for myself. I want to understand the world.",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_1gyfkr,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gyfkr/what_is_internet_dating_anyway_id_rather_do_gamer/,

Should I just be blunt about it?,3,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1b31ek/its_gone_on_for_too_long_what_should_i_do_should/,"So I've been talking on and off with this guy for about a year. Yes. A year. No relationship in that year, it's literally been 3 week periods of talking consistently and then no contact at all for a freaking YEAR. This is a long story but I'll tell it because I'd kinda like to know what to do...

Well, about a year ago, this guy tells me he's literally head over heels for me. When we met, we were in a group of friends and didn't talk much and he was dating someone at the time. Fast forward two years (to last year) and he admits to casually creeping on me for the last couple years and that he couldn't believe I'd actually talk to a guy like him etc etc etc. 
Long story short, I had been doing the same to him and I'm the kind of person who, if someone expresses interest in me, my interest in them multiplies tenfold. But this guy seemed to be everything I was looking for and it was just fantastic. We were on constant contact the next few months, but it slowed after a while. Now, we don't talk too much at all but my feelings still haven't changed. He's mentioned that he absolutely abhors texting and is rather short with me lately, but I don't know if I should connect that to his hating texting or not wanting to talk to me. 
He kind of sort of casually invited me over this week. Now we've planned many things like this but they've always fallen through. I feel like this time though, I'm going to make it work somehow. I think it would be good for me though to get it all out there in the open and either get over him or get on with it, since I'm getting tired of this on/off ordeal. 
So, the big question is, should I just tell him I'm interested in him and wait for an answer or should I continue dropping hints? Half of me is scared but half of me is ready to get it over with and move on if need be. Should I do it in person, text it to him like we've been doing or surprise him and call him?

For a variety of reasons I think it is beneficial to meet folks in person.
However, I'm having the hardest time figuring out *where* to meet folks. All my friends (and even my shrink!) think the bar is a good idea. 

* bars in NYC seem to be mostly couples. Been going to all sorts of bars every night of the week for two weeks all over Williamsburg and the LES.

* Bartenders have told me that the bar scene sucks for meeting people in NYC. 

Some people think Meet-up groups rock

* Meetup groups tend to be heavy on lonely dudes. Not helping me much.

* Meetup groups seem like an inappropriate place to go looking for a date.  

Some people insist I should speed date.

* seems kind of desperate and weird. 

I'm not bad with girls at all (had many many GFs from the inteweb), I just can't seem to find a bar with receptive girls. 
Some bartenders have implied to me the bar scene is dead. 

I'm quite smart, with multiple degrees. I also have mild Aspergers syndrome, which makes this whole exercise feel kind of weird and vague. My field (classical music) is rather dude heavy, so it's hard to date within it. The whole matter is deeply frustrating. 

Any sage advice on where I should go?

My name is *****. I’m 27 years old, but have the body of a 26 year old and the maturity of a 28 year old. I don’t cheat, steal, smoke, do drugs, or belch without providing an apology and can do the moonwalk better than anyone that you know. I’ve been told several times that I look like Brad Pitt. Each instance may have only been a few seconds apart and all instances may have involved the same heavily intoxicated freshman, but the fact still remains : P 


I graduated from XXXXX School of Business at the U of XXXX in 2008, got my CMA designation in 2012, and currently work as a senior accountant. I just bought a house in the fall of 2012 and am working on renovating the basement. In my free time, I enjoy running, playing with my sports car collection, hanging out with my buddies, and contemplating, discussing, and exploring entrepreneurial opportunities.


I could tell you what type of music I like, but then we wouldn’t have anything to talk about on our first date.


I’m looking for someone who loves life. Someone who can and does challenge themselves on occasion, doesn’t take themselves too seriously, enjoys a good conversation.


P.S. If you want the answer to the riddle in my title, you’re going to have to send me a message.

I have my own place, am financially independent, agnostic, brown and have a stable well paying job (Engineer).

Physical:

I'm slightly muscular and trim. A little bit of average pudge around the stomach but I'm working on it. I'm light brown, black hair, dark brown/black eyes. I've been told I'm handsome. I'm 5'5.

I like traveling:

I backpack quite a bit, a lot of time by myself. This winter I'll be backpacking through Central America for three weeks. I've been to France, UK, Switzerland, Scotland, Pakistan, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Bonaire. I love surfing so I always try to visit places where I can surf.

I like running:

I run about three times a week at memorial park. I'm now up to a nonstop six miles. Beginning of August I could only runa bout one continuous mile.

I love martial arts:

I practised Krav Maga, Capoeira, Judo and MMA. I've been on a year long break due to an injury but plan on picking this up again.

I like reading:

I love my kindle. Hemingway is my favorite author, but I've read all kinds of things including, sci-fi and literary classics.

I like learning things:

I'm self taught and mediocre at singing, guitar and other random things.

Movies: I love: Star Wars!!, A beautiful mind, Lord of the Rings, Inception, Last of the Mohicans along with other stuff

Personality:

I'm told I've got a good sense of humor and I can usually get people laughing. I'm pretty emotionally stable. I'm a romantic. I believe that everyone has value and I believe in being kind to people who are not as privileged as I am. I grew up pretty socially awkward, but I actively changed that and am pretty social now. Due to how I grew up, I've always been a loner. I think I'm pretty weird but I accept and embrace my weirdness :).

Misc:

I'm a pretty good cook. I don't really play video games but I used to years ago. I quit smoking at the beginning of this year. I meditate and self-reflect a lot. I'm a thrill seeker and I've been sky-diving and will be going hand gliding soon. I came from a Muslim background but I became Agnostic two years ago. I grew up in Houston but am of a Pakistani background.

So, I'm not sure what I'm looking for. A relationship/an activity partner/ chatting. Just someone to share things with and someone I can connect with. You don't have to be from Houston. I can send pictures through PM.

I am on a diet so I am choosing reddit over a Ben &amp; Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie.

I am 27 year old and I have never dated my whole life. Ever.  I am even older than Josie Gellar when she got kissed.  This is really sad, heh.

I’ve always wanted it but never knew what I was missing.  

That is until last week, when I’ve met him. Now, the only person who knows how I’ve met him is himself.  I am not a good liar but I had no choice.  There is just no way I am going to admit that I met him online.

I never told anyone that I kept an online dating profile because it embarrasses the heck out of me.  Although, mostly every single person is using the medium and the stigma surrounding online dating is slightly fading, I still cringe at the fact that this is the only way I could meet people.

I have always been an introvert.  I never got asked out my whole life, except if you count married men, perverts, homeless people and weird, weird guys.  So when I saw him the first time in a dimly lit sidewalk, I was taken aback.  Fuck, he’s too pretty for me!  And not to mention, one foot taller.  I wanted to run away but I can’t stop staring at his face.

This is the first date I've ever had in my whole life and it was perfect.  He was funny, considerate, sensitive and truly a gentleman.  The second time I’ve met him, it was in his house.  We started watching a documentary, and in  a couple hours or so, we were lying on the carpet facing each other, 6 inches a part. Nothing happened.  He did not try anything except feel my back and my waist.  He did not even try to kiss me.  It felt so good but I still felt safe.  I have watched and read this scenario a thousand times, be it in the movies, pocket books or dramas.  I am from an Asian household where I was raised very conservatively.  What I was doing at that very moment was something I have never picture myself doing.  It was only the second date and here I am being felt all over my back.  When I got home, I felt like a tramp.

I signed up on that website so I can meet my soulmate.  I was looking for someone with a decent job, smart, and hardworking who I could settle with.  This guy is everything except the last one.  I knew he was not looking for a long term relationship.  I cannot tell if he is looking for someone to have casual sex with, but I doubt it.  He is more decent than that.  However, I am fully aware that he will not stay in my city forever.  I was in a dilemma.  Should I just continue and see where it goes?  Take it as experience?  Or should I stop and continue my search?  Why would I invest my heart in a relationship that may not amount to something?  Although I secretly yearn for a Korean drama love story,  I believe myself to be a practical person and I was leaning on the second choice.

I have never dated anyone so I had no idea what a normal relationship should go like.  He knows I am inexperience and is very careful around me.  The fourth time I have met him, we slept together.  Literally slept, nothing sexual ok?  Again, I think I am torturing him, but he contained his lust and did not try anything at all.

That night, I discussed with him about the thoughts that are bugging my brain .

He said, “I can’t believe you’re telling me this. This is the stuff you talk with your sister, not me.”

“I talked to them about it, but I don’t like their answers…so now I am asking you, what’s wrong with that?…So, are you looking for a short fling…for casual…for casual…”  I did not continue.  I cannot.  It was stuck in my throat.

Ah, I couldn’t say SEX.  Are you looking for casual sex???? I cannot utter the damn word!  WHY???  But he knew what I was asking.

Today marks the 7th day since I’ve met him.  He never replied to my morning text which he usually does.

So, it’s over, I guess huh.  I really like him.  Not just his face but his whole persona.

I have a big lump in my tummy.  The same lump I felt the morning after our first date.  But this time, it hurts and it makes me want to cry.  Why did I mess it up?

And still, I haven’t been kissed.  Damn!

So Reddit.. I'm pretty confused right now..

There's this girl I started talking to this summer who (sadly for me) got a boyfriend early in the school year. Fast forward to last week I asked her out to eat after school. I knew her car was having some troubles and she was getting rides with a friend so I thought I'd invite her too. I brought a friend of mine so no one was the third wheel and I thought it went OK.. A little awkward, but not to bad.

The next day I was flipping through my phone and I kind of got the thought she was just being wing girl for her friend (because her friend apparently liked my friend). She wanted to text my friend about him and her friend, so I gave her his number. Because I'm overly curious about everything I asked what they talked about. He said that she said it was a double date without him really knowing.

Now I don't know if she said ""double date"" just because it was easier than saying setting him up, but it got my mind going again. Me being forever alone has me pretty immune to any signs she might('ve) been interested.. Another road block is she still has a boyfriend (as far as I'm aware), and even if he doesn't go to the same school he still is there.

I ask you Reddit.. Should I throw myself in the friend zone? Should I just stop taking to her? Should I try and go for a solo date? What should I do?",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_ljh5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ljh5m/i_am_so_confused_reddit/,

I am going to be there again in a couple months for a few days and, if she says no, am worried about possible awkwardness and 2. all the nurses seem to be very chatty about that sort of thing and I would be embarrassed if she did say no and I ran into one of them later down the road.

I have four things that I am worried about:
-Am I slipping into the ""Friend Zone""?
-Am I interpreting her being flirtatious with me wrong? Is she doing it for tips or is she really into me?

I feel mostly inclined to just play it cool and continue just being friends (maybe with casual flirting) and show her around town but I'm starting to really like her and I'm afraid of getting stuck in an awkward position in the future (like losing her interest in even being friends by making a move too early).

**TL;DR:** Met awesome gal online, wrote back and forth excessively, are interested in one another, wont be able to meet until mid next month. How to manage expectations, how to keep the tension? Use calling as an interim?

**Long**, did read: After many failed attempts, I (21) finally found an interesting girl (19) online that I managed to exchange more than a few lines with, and things keep getting more interesting! We have definitely developed mutual interest and would like to meet each other in person ASAP. 

The problem being: we will not be in the same town until mid/end next month. While that won't be a problem in the long run (we're not aiming for short lived affairs, and we live in said town), I find it increasingly difficult to maintain the tension that has built up. There is some scrutiny about that on her part. For example: Me saying something like ""I can't wait to find out if we're as fascinated by each other in person as we are in writing"" prompts a ""Don't expect too much of it, or ill only disappoint you - I feel the same, though!""

While this indicates quite some interest, I am not sure how to ""play"" this... Obviously, bringing up the excitement about the eventual meet up can be a big turn off and could also blow up in my face spectacularly sooner or later.

So, how do we ""bridge"" this? How do we get more interested in each other, stagnation at this point would be fatal, wouldn't it, and keep expectations reasonable as well? I think we're walking a very fine line here and I'm about to slip, which is why I'm asking for your help :)

I thought about suggesting taking things to the phone/skype, so the first meetup would be less awkward. What are your thoughts on this?

I'd hate to think this is a lost cause. The only other promising tactic i could think of is minimizing contact until the actual meetup, and let chemistry work its magic!

I'm about to turn 24 and she's 21 just out of college. I got her number at a bar a few weeks ago, and then we went out and really hit it off. She admitted during that date, towards the end that she felt extremely comfortable with me and kept commenting how she was having a great time and I felt the same way. This was last week. Last night she invited me out with some of her friends, I went out and we had a blast together. 

The problem in all of this is that I have your standard day job, and she is a server at a restaurant. This causes some pretty huge schedule conflicts. Especially on the weekends where she generally works doubles. Another problem with this particular territory is that her schedule is far from set. I am a persistent bastard but even though she is obviously interested I am now having trouble continuing with my persistence. I'm not needy, but its at a point where  my persistence might start to sound that way. 

Another thing to mention is that she doesn't check her phone often so we usually go 45min-2hours between texts and the like. 

I'd like to keep this as brief as possible but since it will help you guys give advice I figure I'll include some things of relevance. 

Our main form of communication is through texting, calling is not an option for a few irrelevant reasons. I have kept my texting to a reasonable minimum to give her space, but I think I am going to text her a little more often after last night. Not much more. 

Last week I made a joke about her being a tricky one to get out with. She thought it was funny and it started a good conversation, but I figure that joke only works once. 

Last night I floated the idea of lunch. We had tentative plans for today but they fell through due to some prior obligations with her family that she had already forewarned me about. 

She's working late every night this week and has no idea her schedule for the next week. 

So I ask you /r/dating, what advice can you give? Things are great for both of us, but I don't really know how I can do anything with the situation. I've floated the idea of lunch on friday but beyond that I have nothing.

Anyway, had the date with her tonight. I arrived early and got a table. In retrospect that was probably a silly idea since I waited for her outside, but I'll roll with the punches.

Overall, the date went pretty good. I took her to the tapas/wine/cocktail bar I had referenced in the earlier post, which went over pretty well. There were only a few awkward silences, which I am fairly proud of. I did have a hard time with my stutter, but she was more than patient and was pretty cool about it. I had confirmed the date with her the night before and had texted her the address, to which she didn't respond. It's actually been pretty hard to start a conversation with her over text, as she's very busy at her job. It can be difficult to do so in the evenings as well.

With all that said, I am getting the feeling that it was a ""friend date"" for her. For example, she did not reciprocate most of my body language and she showed up in jeans and a hoodie--which I suppose isn't too surprising, as was cold and rainy out all day. She offered to pay part of the bill, left right after dinner to do laundry and grocery shopping, and I never really got a romantic vibe off of everything. In the end, I walked her back to her car but lost my chance to get a hug. 

Now, I don't want to make it sound like I'm disappointed in the date, because I'm not. She's an awesome person and I would love to have her as a friend, even though at the moment I would prefer something more romantic. One of the biggest achievements seems to be that feeling like I need to prove something to her has disappeared, which is great. I'm hoping that that continues.

Even so, I do have some questions:

**1)** I would like to send her a funny, somewhat self-deprecating message about my stuttering. I was thinking something along the lines of, ""Just to let you know I don't usually stutter that bad. You just looked real cute and made me a bit nervous."" I don't want to send that, though, since she was in casual clothes and it sounds *really corny.*

**2)** Even with the ""this-is-a-friend-date"" vibe I got off of it all, she did say that we should do it again sometime. How long should I wait to ask her out again, if at all? Should it be more of a friend thing instead of me attempting to be overtly romantic?

**3)** This probably sounds a little silly, but what are the general steps towards moving in for a hug or a kiss? I've done it before, but this one seems a little bit more difficult. I definitely missed an opportunity for a hug tonight, but I just couldn't figure out how to offer one without being awkward.

**4)** Do I need to explicitly clarify my intentions versus her intentions (e.g. telling her forthrightly that I like her)?

**TL;DR** Went out on a date, it went *okay*. Got a friend vibe off of her, but she said that she'd like to go out again. Want to figure out a way to play off my stuttering, wondering if I need to be explicit about my intentions, and if/when I should ask her out again.",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_k8g6c,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/k8g6c/questions_after_date/,

Slightly confused ..,3,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/k451e/ambiguous_datenondate_ending_slightly_confused/,"A female work colleague of mine asked me to join her for a drink with her friend (I started to suspect at that point she might be trying to set me up). I went along, and I met her friend and we hit it off (she was laughing at my jokes so things were going pretty good).

My work colleague then left, and her friend then asked me to join her and we continued chatting and learning more about each other's lives. As the time passed and it approached the time where we would have to get on our way, I thought I should probably end the date as you don't want them to drag on too long right? I suggested that it's getting late and we'll miss our trains/trams ... all good.

I told her I would walk her to the tram stop, which I did, at which point I told her it was lovely getting to know her and she said the same. I gave her a hug and kiss on the cheek, and got her number; I indicated I would like to see her again.

The next day I sent the following message : ""Hi Sarah, it was really great getting to know you and learning about your life. Enjoy your weekend :-) - John""

She responded with : ""Hey thanks John. Was nice getting to know you too. Always like meeting new people. See you in 2 weeks at Amy's leaving drinks :-)""

So, my theory is this... if I wait 2 weeks, she'll think I'm too cool and not so interested. If she just left it at 'Always like meeting new people' then it would be clear she's not interested in pursuing things further.

In any case, I'm going to ask her out again because she's great fun; I'm just curious about what is going through a woman's head with a message like this ...

They'll do the long scam on me, and I'm putting up red flags because the conversation seems so shallow.  I ask them about their work, and they ignore me.  They don't talk in a normal way, but they talk using lots of words you'd see in a dating profile... like, I'm looking for a guy who is handsom, outgoing, and likes the outdoors.  Do people really talk like that in normal conversation?  Anyway, the end of it all is that they need me to transfer them money from one of their accounts to England so they can board a plane to get back to the states.  I'm not gonna do that to someone putting up red flags for me.

It is kinda annoying that it is the long scam, because it is wasting hours and hours of my time which I think I'm trying to get to know someone.  But really it is just some scam artist trying to gain trust with me so they can scam me.  Has anyone else run across money mules trying to dupe bachelors on Match.com?

Been feeling this way for at least a year and more now, because she's exactly my type - cute, goody and has that childish sense of wonder with the world that I also have, also we're the same age.

Problem is the moment I started to look as girlfriend material at her like 8 months ago (was in relationship some time before that so was just being nice to her and avoiding thoughts about her or spending too much time) - I started getting to know more about her, going almost every day with her and other colleagues to lunch, sometimes just the two of us, also to movies, theatre, we like quirky movies just us two... Well I started liking her more, we talked a lot and about whatever subject and this doesn't happen to me with everyone - to be able to talk for hours.

And then 2-3 weeks later this other male colleague returned from vacation and started coming to lunch with us regularly - and she was always the one inviting him and making sure he comes. And also most of the time she was talking with him mainly and looked kinda he's the main guy for her there, also inviting him always to whatever outings we had.

So I kinda got disheartened by that, thought she had decided on him or at least prefers him over me so any thought of telling her how I feel vaporised and under the pretence I'm learning to cook I stopped going with them and started bringing food from home and spending time with other colleagues.

So half a dozen months pass, I still see they're always going to lunch together and waiting on each other, no matter only the two of them or someone else too. I ignore them and try to notice as little as I can because... heartbreak :/  

I decided not to ignore her that much recently and just be nice and we ended up on a couple of outings together, still talking a lot and I think both enjoying it. No sign of the other guy at movies, theatre, etc. No sign of anything between them except always going together on lunch.


**So I'm confused.** I still like her a lot. But have no idea if there's something between them. 

Decided to ask her straight honestly though a bit goofy and with a smile 'Hey, is there something between you guys? Cos' you always go together on lunch?' 

A female friend of mine told me NO, NOT TO DO THAT IN ANY WAY, because it's too intrusive and she might keep it a secret anyway. Told me to tell her that I like her instead and to ask her if we can see each other more regularly (I suck at dating, my only gf we were friends for like a year and half before our relationship).

Which is something I don't dare to do because I fear she's dating the other guy and telling her how I really feel will complicate things a lot. (Also our desks face each other and we have like 3 metres between us every day). 

I have no idea what to do, but I'd hate to pass on a girl with such lovely characters, because I've met such very rarely, and I really like only this type.

**Tl;dr: I like a girl at the office but am unsure if she has something with another colleague, have decided that I should either ask her flat out if she's free, or tell her how I feel or shut up and die.

And I immediately think ""yeah right, it's another girl"" I hate being like this and I truly want to stop. He has never given me any reason to not trust him so I hate that I do that. I fear I'm going to ruin us.

Anyone else been thru a similar situation and care to share? And advice is greatly appreciated. ",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_1jryfa,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jryfa/trust_help/,

I'm a competitive boxer, have been a pugilist for a number of years and really enjoy what I do. I help out with our boxing club where I can (either financially, or with physical labour) and I coach the youth boxing team. Needless to say, this doesn't leave me with a lot of time to go out and meet women (I also hold down a full time job above and beyond the 25ish hours I put in to my training and 10hrs of coaching). 

Now, we have a few women who sign up for some of our classes. Some for the cardio/fitness classes and some who actually want to learn the art of boxing. About a month ago, a girl, who we'll name Michelle (she has a pretty unique name, so in case she Reddits, I'm making this a little more vague), signed up at the club. Drop dead gorgeous. She takes a couple of the cardio classes and then starts coming to the real boxing classes. We get paired up for a few exercises and talk a little bit. End of the class, she wants to spar. So she gets all the gear on, and the coach puts me in the ring against her and tells me I'm not allowed to go on the offensive, I can only work my defense. Not a problem. We go for a few rounds and she's really good. 

After we hop out of the ring, we get talking and I find out this is her first time boxing ever and I mention how I'm impressed. She asks if I could help her out with her technique and stuff sometime. I say sure. We exchange numbers. 

We've texted a little bit outside of the ""what time were you going to be headed in at?"" or ""go work the mitts for awhile?"". Nothing too flirty, however, when we're at the gym, she always angles herself to get partnered up with me for doubles exercises and it's some playful flirting. Last week she stuck around to watch me spar with some of the other competitive fighters. Long story short, I bobbed when I should have weaved and I got my lip bust open pretty badly. I hope out of the ring and she comes over with the first aid kit (find out, she's a nursing student) and patches me up, all the while playing around and telling me head movement would keep me looking pretty. 

My question to Reddit, how do I proceed? How do I ask her out without making shit too awkward? I've never tried to pick up anybody at the gym, but with us talking outside every now and then, I figured it can't hurt.

1. Where can I meet more ""weird"" girls. This sounds like a dumb question I know, but all around me seem to be cookie cutter girls who all look, dress, think the same. Where could I more easily find girls more on the more indie/intellectual/artsy/nerdy side??

2. How do I go about arranging a second meetup?? I'm pretty confident and not bad looking, approaching has never been a problem for me; however, I like to take leave before the conversation dries up to not sully an otherwise good impression. Problem is, I've never been good at setting up a future. The simple ""we should meet up again sometime"" oftentimes gives the certainty of flirting and intimidates them into saying no. I don't really know how else to go about it though. Mondo help needed on this one.

Do you think he could be gay and fancy his flatmate? His flatmate was really into me all night, like he was by my side most of the night He doesnt show other typical signs, he doesnt like girly things, and plays xbox(hes guyish) Im a girl by the way, so I take it his friend is straight. lol Last night he wanted everyone to leave me and his friend alone though.. so Im confused. Is he just being overly protective cause he thinks im leading his friend on ? Been friends about 6 months.

Here's this mornings facebook convo:

Him: any more housemates your after? ''just dancing""... oh come on steph

Me: Nothing happened with declan, he pursued me and I refused!

Him: dont play dumb with me...

me: nothing even happened, just friendly

him: bullshit...oh come on steph..i was about to take a picture... thats how it was.. dont lie..why do you think we ALL left you guys to it? coincidence? i know what i saw steph...

him: no way denial, utter denial, we could all see it

Me: it wasnt anythingg lol just a dance..its not like we kissed or anything

Him: YEAH... THATS RIGHT oops caps* lol although they could be used in this instance

Knew this girl in grade school, had a decent crush on her. Shoot forward to college, we ran into each other at the local bar and started talking and going out to the bars together this past spring with friends. She got out of a LTR (5 years) this past spring, just a couple months prior to us meeting up. I also got out of a year and a half relationship about the same time as her. 

We never had sex but spent the night at each others' houses a couple times a week for a few weeks. Eventually, I tried to ask her out (to go get food together, go downtown for a salsa dancing event) a couple times and each time she ended up being ""busy"" and kind of blew it off. I realize now that she obviously wasn't ready to start dating again. After that, the communication died.

About a month ago, just as my college was starting our holiday break her and I ran into each other again at the same local bar. Like the first time she again couldn't stop talking to my buddy about me about how good I was looking and how much she liked me. We went to another bar together that night and we talked alone for a bit and she actually apologized for what had happened earlier this year and told me ""that talking to me sort of freaked her out since she just got out of her relationship."" 

So for the past month or so, we've been doing what we did earlier this year... talking via text, meeting up at bars, hanging out for a while, then eventually going to bed together. She has told me countless times how ""amazing"", ""so great"", and how much she ""really likes me."" Unfortunately it's usually when she's been drinking but she has told me (when sober) that she does feel more comfortable around me than she does other guys and its rare that this happens.

I've been told that i just need to keep taking it casual with her because of her long relationship and when she's ready something might happen.. though it feels like I'm being friend-zoned. I think i just need to get to know her more by hanging out with her and her friends.

Reddit, what are your opinions?? I'm confused because if she ""really likes me"" and feels so much more comfortable around me than other guys, I feel as though she should be showing it a little more? A good friend of hers also quoted her saying ""I'm good in bed."" The pieces of this puzzle just aren't fitting together in my mind...

tl;dr Talking to this girl for a while (out of a LTR). We'll hangout and end up in each others' beds. She things I'm great, really ""likes"" me and is really comfortable with me yet hasn't shown much interest besides that. Confused as to where this is going.

* I'm 20 years old, College Student studying and trying to get a Bachelor's in Architectural Designing.
* Half Thai / Filipino - Asian, dark skinned, 5'10, average body type.
* Moderately nerdy: Video games, some occasional anime, etc.
* I also enjoy watching a lot of movies and shows, particularly The Walking Dead. Because you know, zombies are pretty awesome at what they do.
* Games that I play nowadays are League of Legends, Minecraft, Dishonored, Torchlight Series, MMO's, some horror games and some adventure games like Legend of Zelda.
* I also like to draw and do some Photoshopping, pretty fun thing to do when you want to make things look shiny as hell. I also make some banners, backgrounds and such with Photoshop for some people at Twitch.TV.
* My personality is pretty chill and goofy, I don't like being serious for too long since I enjoy joking around to keep things on the brighter side. Did you know I do a pretty good Goofy voice? I didn't either till I tried it out recently :P


I'm not very picky, but I'd like to meet someone that has the same interests as me or at least half of them.

I've had 2 dates with her. The second date was really **awesome** and she really liked it. I also catched **lots** of 'signs' coming from her. However, lacking dating experience, I messed that date up (understood that 5 minutes after I messed it up) and did not make out with her nor offer to lead her home. Also it needs to be mentioned that there were a lot of touching (hand holding, romantic hugging, etc.) . All that happened at the previous weekend.

So, I've decided that I will fix that errors on the next date, but as the laws of universe work - shit decided to happen: due to various reasons we can't meet approximately 2 weeks from now (3 weeks total). 

She's a very shy girl, I like her a lot and really would like to call her every day. However, reading several articles on dating, I decided that calling every day without making out at least once would come out as creepy or would lead me to a friendzone. That's why I called her 3 times during the past week. I'm newbie at flirting and smalltalking, so our conversations are usually 5-15 minutes long.

Today I realized that we wont meet up for 2 more weeks and got really depressed. How and how much should I communicate with her during that time to show her that I like her and to not appear as too pushy or needy? During today's talk I said ""I'd really like to see you more often"", was that a good thing or a bad one? Any other more general advice on how to talk with her during that damn 2 week period?

Thanks in advance.

So i've liked this girl for a while, but never really done anything about it. She's damn attractive, and into a lot of the same things as i am. She was in one of my classes at my college last semester, and we'd talk during smoke breaks, and we have mutual friends.
She always was a bit awkward and engaged when talking to me, you know, acting like you like someone, but i'm sort of convinced i was just making it up because I wanted to believe she could be flirting. At the end of the day though i didn't really focus on it or asking her to hang out 'cause it was just programmed that she might be out of my league. I'm pretty confident, and a good conversationalist, so it's not like i can't talk to her, but i guess i just have a sort of imagined ceiling as far as what level of attractive I can date? I'm not a bad looking guy and I dress and carry myself well. interested in a lot of different things (and share commonalities with this girl in particular). But I still have this...limit, i guess you could say. 

Summer happened, and we did our respective things. You know, there's those people from school you don't really talk to outside of it.
The other day, she came and sat next to me in a computer lab and we talked some, it was pretty good conversation. As she was getting up to leave she said that ""we should get lunch sometime"" i was pretty enthusiastic about that, and said yeah, later realizing i didn't get her number. 
I sent her a message on facebook reinforcing that, and asking her to go this week, she sent her number with the reply and i reciprocated. So now we're going to lunch.

Combing back through all our previous interactions it seemed to culminate into some'thing', and the friends i've told about it are pretty sure she must be into me (it's worth noting that those people aren't mutual friends). 

So i guess my question is here, how do i confirm my suspicions so to speak?

I want to try out online dating sites, however I feel the need to ask for some tips to make it easier for me to find The One girl for me. 

First of all, I'm looking for long-term relationships, I consider anything less than that a waste of my time. 

Here is a list of types of girls that look suspicious to me. Should I contact them anyway or they are not what I need? Any more types I missed?

1. The girl mentions ""long-term relationship"" but **also** ""flirt"", or ""sex"" in her interests.
2. The girl has tonns of presents, friends and upvotes. (usually makes me think about one-nighters)
3. The girl looks very good and has registration date 3+ years ago but also is active (kind of makes me think she is here only for messaging). This type usually comes with number 2.
4. The girl did not bother to fill out any of her interests or info and only added 1-2 photos. Also answering rate is awfully low (5-10%) (some dating sites show it).

Also some general questions:

1. When is it best to ask for a phone number/appoint a date? Day of communication, week, month?
2. After asking for a phone number - she rejected. Should I continue communication or is it a dead end?
3. In general, should my messages be long and pretty (telling about lots of stuff I find interesting) or short and simple (usually an emotional feeling about something and an opposite question)? 
4. Several times I was trying to write long messages to some girls and they started to respond with long messages too. With one of them - our message length went to half a page of text. Did she really find it interesting talking with me, or was that some kind of ""mirroring"" me? Is that a good sign overall?
5. Any tips on how girls behave in online dating sites when they are interested in a guy? Some key questions maybe? Overall style of communication?

I finally did so on Tuesday, and she said yes. Woo!

So now what? I've had girlfriends in the past, but only one of them came about from any sort of pursuit on my part. Plus, I've never been on a proper date with a girl I don't know all that well by ourselves.

In any case, this is what I have so far:

**1)** She's out of town this weekend for a wedding. I figured I'd send her a text asking how it's going. She's a bridesmaid and I guess she won't have much time to respond or even read it, but I think she'd appreciate the thought.

**2)** At the start of the week ask her to drinks. Something along the lines of, ""I'm going to this bar at this time. Want to come along?"" I'm thinking about a low-key tapas/wine/cocktail bar.

**3)** Do I offer to pick her up or do I meet her there?

I think my main hurdle will be trying not to be awkward. Any pointers on keeping things rolling and interesting? I tend to be reasonably competent when I'm not over thinking things, but I seem to always second-guess myself and become overwhelmed.

**TL;DR-** Finally asked a girl out on Tuesday after liking her for a bit. She said yes, thinking about texting her over the weekend and asking her to drinks at the start of the week.

Last week a friend asked if I wanted to go out with a girl he knew, thought we might hit it off. She's the nice/shy type overall so we end up going out for lunch and have a pretty decent time. We talked a lot, no real awkward pauses or anything so considering that was my first date in my life (turn 20 in a month) I'd say it went pretty well.

When I take her back to the dorm on campus she was living at (we both go to same university) we hang out for most of the rest of the day with some mutual friends. Pretty much all of which are gay guys. At this point it's not going fantastic, I don't really feel a big connection, but it could be going way worse too. I like her and I'm pretty sure she likes me. She's given me hugs and things but just doesn't seem to want to talk much. I can't tell if it's me or if she's shy or what.

A few days later and I end up crashing at our mutual friends place for 2 days which she hangs out there constantly. So at this point for a few hours each day I'm in the same room as her, some times alone and sometimes not, but she seems to be kind of distant. Doesn't talk much, listening to head phones, browsing the internet. I come to find out later that she failed her chemistry course for the second time so I figure she must be going through a rough time. She also went home this week and I overheard her say that her dad is an asshole so I'm guessing she doesn't really enjoy going home. 

Overall I'm just kinda confused. I'm pretty sure she likes me or at least did. Idk if she's just kinda depressed about all the things that are happening or if I've started to bore her (I've had trouble trying to talk to her becaue I'm a bit shy myself and she doesn't seem to bring much to the conversations) or what.

As this was my first weekend back in town since ""meeting,"" we were going to go out this weekend.

I even got a message from her 24 hours ago ending in, ""Hope work is going well this week and I will chat with you soon.""  So, I'm looking forward to meeting her.

Anyone else ever look back at a random encounter with someone from the opposite sex and facepalm yourself for not trying to obtain contact information?  I HATE when that happens!  I have two that come to mind:

* Senior year of college I'm waiting outside of the library at my school for the rest of my group to arrive to put the finishing touches on the final project of one of my ""final semester"" classes.  I'm smoking cigarettes, reading over what I have in the freezing ass cold and waiting for the rest of my group to meet me and this chick walks up and bums my lighter.  We get to talking, she's waiting for a different group for a different project for a class I had the year before.  We spend the next 30 minutes talking about EVERYTHING in one of the best conversations I've ever had in my life.  Like...I totally connect with this girl.  She's gorgeous, intelligent, great taste in music, and at the time I was a huge NFL fan and she could even out-football-talk me.  But for whatever reason our groups arrived, we went our separate ways, and I never got her number or even her name.  I still think about that shit even though it happened almost 8 years ago.
* This past December I'm at work (retail manager so it's slammed) and although I'm the only manager there at the time, we were busy enough to where I was helping people find things and not really managing (happens during retail and the holidays).  I work with this absolutely AMAZING chick for about 45 minutes...have a great conversation in general not even really related to anything that she was buying.

(x-post),2,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/hnpxz/should_i_ask_for_another_date_or_should_i_wait/,"Ok, we are both 29 . I've only been in 2 long term relationships, and the last one ended 2 months ago. I don't have much dating experience. You could consider me rather good looking, normal weight, funny/witty and will liked among friends. I'm not socially awkard or extremely shy but I do have some self-esteem issues (which i'm working on)

Anyway, enough with the intro. I got introduced (facebookwise) by a mutual friend to this girl. We have a lot in common music/movie wise, we talked and mailed for about a week and then I asked her on a date (concert), we had a great time, talked a lot , it was fun. She gave me a goodnight kiss (on the cheek). Two days later I asked if she wanted to go for dinner and a movie that weekend and she immediatly said yes. That date went great too, great dinner, fun talking, nice movie. And when i dropped her of we kissed a bit (I was a tad too nervous thou :/)

Next day I asked if we could do something on sunday, and she wanted to, we decided that we would watch something at her place and she'd make dinner. Again it was a nice time, I did kiss her again but it wasn't that passionate or anything.

So I know that i'm probably too cautious , the thing is that due to my low self-esteem (and my previous relationship) I find it hard to believe that she likes, likes me and that holds me back. The fact that she's very pretty and i do like her only makes it more difficult to believe she might be into me...

But the actual dilemma is now that I want to ask her if she wants to do something together this week, but maybe I should wait for her to ask me ? (i've asked the previous 3 times). Today I was kinda bummed out about the idea that I might have blown it by being too cautious/nice but then she did mail me (general chitchat) so that made me feel good. But now I don't know if I should ask her out again and ""man up"" this time and just assume she does like me. Or should I wait for her to ask me this time...

Any suggestions ? :",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_hnpxz,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/hnpxz/should_i_ask_for_another_date_or_should_i_wait/,

I  dated a girl for a year and a half, she was emotionally distant but had a lot of other cool stuff about her.  Finally broke it off with her about a year ago.  About 6 months later I started dating this other girl, Amy.  She was awesome, we dated for a few months, it was great.  Only problem was I wasn't feeling it.  My brain was saying ""Yes! this girl is the one!"" but I just wasn't getting into it emotionally, I was frigid about the whole thing.  She was really starting to like me a lot and I broke it off with her.  It wasn't right that she was developing intense feelings for me while I was stuck in my mental funk leftover from the other girl.  We stayed friends and a few months later I started to really like Amy alot.  We went bowling one night and one thing led to another and we ended up back at my place.  I decided after that that I was going to tell her I wanted to get back together and we planned on meeting up again that next Friday.  Well two days before were supposed to hang out again I find out she met a guy.  This is where I screwed up.  I should have dove in there and told her how I felt but i was stunned by it and waited a few weeks before telling her how I felt.  Well she says she still has feelings for me too but she said this guy is a really good guy and she is starting to like him too and she doesn't want to hurt him.  The guy sounds like an absolute prick to me, he told her he doesn't want her to be friends with me anymore (to which she refused)  The dude doesn't ever want to even meet me, he's religous (she isn't) and he doesn't eat steak.  WHAT KIND OF NON-VEGETARIAN TEXAN DOES NOT LIKE STEAK! and there's stuff he wont do with her, little stuff like go to Chinese buffets (she's like me, we both like to get a little bite of everything)  Anyway my point is that I really really like Amy, i'm borderline in love with her.

1303017106.0,2,self.dating,grwfs,Project: Find a Girl for Beach Vacation Travel. Let's discuss this plan.,5,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/grwfs/project_find_a_girl_for_beach_vacation_travel/,"Hi Reddit dating. This is obviously not my main account, it's set up so I can explore an idea. The anonymity probably isn't necessary, but hey, why not? Once anonymity is breached one can't go back. 

I went on a date last night that led to this idea that I'm going to share with all of you, and I need you to help me flesh it out and make this project into something cool that will work. 

But first the backstory about myself and last night- 

I believe in not doing things halfassed. This shows in my work, and as such, I tend to meet a lot of pretty girls who come around because of my business. One of them, not under contract, started to show a little interest in me, so how do I show her I like her? With last minute tickets to a big sold-out show she'd said she wished she could go to, that's how! She had to be at least a little impressed. 

It wasn't a bad date as dates go, but I'm old enough (30) to read the signs and see that she wasn't interested in taking it further romantically or even just physically. So dejected, I had consolation drinks with some friends and headed home. 

Then in the morning, I got an idea. OkCupid has never quite worked for me, and that's a whole different discussion, so why not try to find some way to use Reddit like a dating site? 

What I've got is a little bit of knowledge, a little bit of money, and a little bit of time from June to August to rent a cottage by a beautiful Southeast Asian Beach Resort. Now all I need is a traveling companion. Already this is starting to sound like a stupid TV reality show. 

Suppose I were to post this as a *reward* with rules and conditions like a dating contest show? My first question is which Subreddits would it go in? This one I guess, but what others? I doubt TwoXChromosomes would appreciate the crass intrusion, ha ha!

I have in mind a series of elimination rounds to preserve my privacy and that of any girls responding who might be interested. Correspondence would be private but I could post updates for spectators.
It might go something like this:

Round 1=
Any and all girls reply to my initial post titled something like ""Who wants a beach vacation date with a cute guy?"" They reply with a simple, ""sign me up, let's find out more.""

Round 2=  
I message each respondent back with more info about me, perhaps 10 pros and cons about myself. And 10 questions for them. 

Round 3=
p3oPLE whO riTe LIKE THIS r emlinited

We trade photos. 

Round 4=
Someone posts my photo in the thread after I've asked them to please not do so. If there are enough upvotes some of my friends will recognize me and we'll have a good laugh. 

Round 5=
E-mail, maybe Skype, real names, and consideration of schedules and ability to meet in person for a face to face conversation. I may be able to travel just for that. 

That's where I'm still mulling over the details. Of course I don't want to take too much of a chance and wind up vacationing with a psycho hosebeast. One quick meeting with a girl who sticks with all this game show bullshit would be enough for us to clinch it and make me feel good about inviting her out. Also as a diving partner she may very well be in a position to kill me!  

However if there are more than two girls who I want to meet in person and check out, then I'm not sure I can easily fly all over the world to do this. One flight, maybe. Or I could try and keep this whole thing contained to one region, like New York City?

So, collective brilliance of Reddit, what are your suggestions? Please help me form the perfect ""Who wants a beach vacation date with a cute guy?"" scenario and tell me where to post it? 

Looking forward to the commentary,

I got curious so I followed her on twitter seemed normal to me she had a tweet that talked about sending nudes and as bored as I was I sent her one. She responded telling me I had a nice two toned penis and it reminded her of a butterfinger. Luckily the pics didn't have the wild dingle berries in them. We then proceeded to talk on occasion. Then it comes to a point where we exchange numbers. Around Christmas time I jokingly told her I am going to get her a gift. She said I will get you a gift too. Mind you I never met this girl in my life. It's already hard enough for me to spend money on someone I care about but someone I never met I think not. FaceTime her a few times to assure she was a woman. Christmas came and I got a big ass package in the mail she actually did send me something. I felt guilty I didn't buy her shit. Made up excuses and told her the mail system must be fucked up or something. Finally sent her a gift she loved it at least I think for my birthday she sent me 300 in twenty dollar bills by mail I was excited and felt guilty taking money from a girl. Now I told her I had school bills to pay which I do and she proceed to send another 500$ that week. I feel really guilty I did promise her i am going to visit I'm having my doubts about her at times but getting money from her is pretty radical I sound like a lame but I do love her should I give her the money back or keep it,,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_1dg886,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1dg886/started_with_a_nude/,

The landlord screwed her over and she had no place to go, so I moved out of my parents and gave them a place to live....this was mid December.  It has been rough, but for awhile we had no problems in the bedroom.....then that started slowing down.  The past two weekends her kids have been at their dads, and she went out to friends....this is a problem because we haven't spent time together with just the two of us since like october....I am not sure if she is cheating, or is legitimately just hanging out with friends...she is drinking, so staying the night.  We talked about it, and I think she understands that I've had enough....and I mentioned that she could have brought me instead of leaving me here with nothing to do.  Now we face another dilemna....I work first shift (6am-2:30pm) at one plant, and she works third shift at the other local factory (11pm-7am)....I get the feeling that the problems in the bedroom are not going to go away...How will we ever, you know....have intimate time together?   The only times I can think of is when she gets home from work saturday morning..and maybe one or two nights a week before she goes to work...but I dunno how to bring it up to her.  

There are some issues with her showing me she wants this, I may be a man, and i know how men ""arent supposed to have feelings""...but there are certain needs not being met.  I told her last night that I don't expect it every day/night....because then it wouldn't be as ""special""...but without it I have a feeling I won't be able to tolerate it for long.  This goes further than the bedroom...she used to randomly come up and kiss/hug me, tell me she loved me, etc..and now its like I'm getting the silent treatment.    I know that now that she's working some of the stress we had with bills will go away..but I want us to be like before, happy and without doubts.....because anytime she leaves while we are struggling with the relationship I feel like maybe she is moving on...and really doesn't want this anymore....which, I've told her..if she doesn't she needs to say...but she still has nowhere to go, and I don't want to keep trying only to realize it has all been a lie...trying to protect myself..but dunno how.

Well in the program there was about 35-45 people total and we all got along great. We all stayed in one dorm and hung out with each other and bonds were made very quickly. Well about 2 days into the program I notice this girl...and I find her extremely attractive! So we start to hang out and we exchange phone numbers. Well we talk everyday just through meeting and I start to develop a crush on said girl. Well one night after being flustered by small annoyances I decided to go for a run. Everyone was surprised by this because my physical stature shows that I am not in the best of shape.( note; I'm not to terribly out of shape but it shows) Well the girl says gimme five and I'll go get my shoes and I'll go running with you! I reluctantly say yes! And a few of my friends ask if I have a crush on her and I told them yea I do. They all laugh and chat about it and the girl comes outside and we go running. I bust my ass for this girl. We even walk another lap around campus and then retreat to our dorms for the rest of the night. Well the next day after lunch we decided to head to the dorm to go grab a few things and start talking about crushes and one of my friends goes I think that Trey(me) has a crush on M( the girl). I heavily blush and say maybe..and the girl says maybe I guess we will never know and we continue our walk. Well the next night we go on a walk in a big group and we decided to have a few races along the way, another thing is that my legs were on fire from the running the night before because I ran in skate shoes..., anyway I bust my ass and after getting near the  dorm I see that what I though was the pizza I order got there and took off like a rocket to get it well while I took off anther of my friends tell M that I like her and that I had been busting my ass for her and she replied that I was cute. 

After the academy was over I started to text her and we had been constantly flirting and conversing over the past week but lately her texts have dwindled to less and less. And to my knowledge I never texted anything creepy because I was very careful in what I texted.

I've come to the realization a couple of years ago that I feel cynical about dating and can't understand it when it comes to choosing to be in relationships with many partners before getting married. The whole date/breakup cycle just seems flawed to me. I understand that sometimes things just don't work out between a couple, but I'm under the impression that most people date without the intention of ever being with said person forever, and I don't understand why people would choose to live a lifestyle where you intentionally have several different relationships before ""settling down"", instead of going into each relationship with the objective of finding your potential soulmate. 

It's because of this that I've decided that I only want to be in a relationship with someone who would be open to settling down with me should things work out between us, and I don't want to have sex with someone until we reach the point where we can see ourselves spending our lives together. I realize that my beliefs are pretty unpopular, and I'm very open to being proven wrong. Can anyone give me reasons why I'm wrong, and what are the chances that I'll find a girl that will agree to putting off sex until marriage, knowing that I'm a virgin as well?


TL;DR:

1. Intentionally dating many people before settling down makes no sense to me, and I think it makes more sense to date with the objective of finding your potential soulmate because it involves less breakups and bs. Am I wrong and why?

I worked at a tutoring center when this really cute girl got hired. We were only open a few hours a week and we were really busy all the time, so I didn't have a lot of interaction with my coworkers. Thus, in the 3 months she was there, we basically smiled and said hi to one another everyday and talked maybe once. I didn't really have the courage at the time to ask her out, and when I finally worked up the nerve, I found out she was moving away to another state for school.

I ended up adding her on Facebook (September of 2010), even though we didn't know each other all that well. But, it turns out we have a lot in common. I knew I had to be careful about seeming creepy hitting on her on Facebook, so I mostly stuck to commenting on or liking my statuses. And for awhile, she was basically liking ever status I put up over the next few months. Not having the confidence I have now and lacking any concrete signals, I didn't ask her to talk on the phone or on Skype or anything.

We're now in Spring of 2011, pretty much a year since we met. We had cooled off on liking each other's pictures and statuses. I did this because I always tried to keep my distance a little in order to not seem clingy. We went maybe 2 months without any interaction on Facebook when she sent me an invite to come over to her house for a get together. This was a big step for m since at this point, I didn't know her that well and we still had never had a real live interaction in person. I hadn't considered her a good enough friend to earn an invite to her house since we had had so little interaction in person.

I wen to her party and had a really good time. We didn't talk as much as I wanted since I was careful not to monopolize her time. She was only in town for a few days, so she needed to see all of her friends. At the end of the night, I hinted that we should hang out if she was free, but she actually had plans for the next few days since she only had a few days in town anyway. I wondered whether this was rejection or if she really didn't have time.

Fast forward a few months to now. I finally asked her to Skype and she agreed to this. We have chatted once and I feel like it was a good time. And we have been interacting on Facebook more as well. She has tagged me in a few comics and we've playfully been bantering back and forth.

I am considering just telling her how I feel because I fear that I have worked so hard to not seem clingy or creepy that I have been too subtle about my intentions. Considering that she is in another state and that I probably won't be able to see her in person until maybe December or even March, do I still have a chance? Or will I just seem desperate hitting on a girl that is in another state that I have known for more than a year, yet have not made any type of move on?

I am basically looking for an interpretation of the signals I described above. She used to comment on my stuff on Facebook a lot with me barely saying anything. Then she pulled back and I started commenting on her stuff. Was she interested at first and now only sees me as a friend? Or do I have a chance with her?

tl;dr: Met a girl at work. She moved away for school. We got to know one another on Facebook over the course of a year and only met in person once. We have Skyped once. Do I have a chance with this girl that I only interact with online that is in another state? Or was a year way too long to wait on this? Am I friend zoned, or does the lack of contact between us over time play into my hands?",,False,,t5_2qhb1,True,,,True,t3_lnyt3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/lnyt3/my_long_storyhow_should_i_proceed/,

Here is where one girl, let's call her Kristen, was different.  She was showing signs of interest (bumping into me while walking side-by-side, laughing at unfunny things, the look) and couldn't be more obvious about her interests in me.  The 15 year old me knew she was interested, but I was consumed with the thought that she was just fucking with me, even though we have the same actions and into the same things.  She slowly stopped giving signals, and by the time I gather the courage to ask her out... she said ""sorry, but we're too close as friends"".  As hurt as I was, I understood it was my fault for not taking action when I should have.  Things chance once she sees me in the talent show (vocals in metal band) she shows interest again.  Still not believing something that good could be happening to me, I didn't even try.  We stayed friends, but I had to drop out of school at 17 and get my GED to help take care of my mom who broke her knees in a car crash.  We drifted apart.

Fast forward to last Thursday, I went to my local Chili's for a ""Young Adults With Cancer"" meeting and see her as our hostess.  We talk for a while and then on my out I tell her to stop by my house after work, something I wouldn't have done before, and to my surprise it worked.  She stayed for about an hour, but had to leave because of an early class the next morning.  While she didn't really show interest, we talked the entire time.  The only clue she gave is that she wanted to see Paranormal Activity 3, which I didn't realize until today.  So I started texting her and after a couple text I ask if she has seen the movie yet, and of course she already had.  I told her that I was actually just about to ask her to go see it with me and she said ""I'm sorry :( I would have totally loved going to see it with you"".  We talked about the movie a little more and I asked if their might be another movie she wants to see and she says ""none that are out right now"".

I'm over my fear of rejection (I guess facing your mortality really puts shit in perspective) but I don't really know how to ask her out.  Could I have fucked up my last chance?  Their isn't a lot to do in my town so any and all suggestions are appreciated.

**tl;dr - Seen the girl who I had a huge crush and a couple chances with in high school the other day and we chilled at my house later that night.  Wanting to ask her out, but not sure how.**

I met a guy a couple of months ago at concert and we talked for a bit afterwards. He gave me his number, but I was dating someone at the time and told him that I already had a boyfriend and said he was ok with being friends. We text and all that and hangout a couple of times platonically while I am still with my boyfriend.

Fast forward about a month and I have broken up with my boyfriend. This is unknown to the guy when I go hang out with him one evening. I mention to him that I had left my boyfriend. He proceeds to tell me that he finds me attractive and interesting and making out ensues, etc. 
I was a bit apprehensive at first. But we hung out 3 days in a row, which was awesome, and included, weed, movies and sex. I told him I didn't want anything serious, and he seemed to agree.

So now he's not answering my texts in almost a week. I know this is a short time, but to not talk at all, is it normal? I just don't know if I am to assume he no longer wants to see me, or should I ask him what's going on?

She said something that led me to say something along the lines of ""oh so what your saying is you miss me."" and she replied with ""As a friend, yes I would say i miss you."" Now she wants to come and visit me. But she said she needs to save up some money and take the time off work so she won't be able to come up until next month.

Most recently, while I sit there chatting with a good buddy of mine, she always smiles at me when our eyes meet and she happily joins in on the conversation. This is where I need help.

Edit: *update*.  Date happened, and nothing special, rather boring, I asked all sorts of questions, she got bored and became even more boring after that (hard to become more boring than attempting to name drop book and movie titles, and getting them wrong) and when she said she'd like to call it a night, the look of surprise on her face as I diligently paid the bill and told her I'd walk her to her truck, that was priceless.

I told her I'd take her out again if she wanted, maybe somewhere with less people and an open space.  Honestly, I hope she doesn't take me up on that offer.

I was with friends, she was with friends. We were leaving and told them to meet us at another bar later that night and they actually showed up. We all danced and drank and had a good time. 

Told her our other friend was having a birthday party tomorrow and they should come... got her number (!) and told her I would text her the details the next day. Kiss on the cheek goodnight.

Text her the next night, go back and forth a little bit... they never show up. She texts the next day apologizing, saying they were with a group and couldn't really motivate everyone to go. I say I know how it goes, and would she like to meet for lunch or a drink sometime next week. She writes back asking how the party was, and asking if I'm around this coming weekend.

I tell her I'll be around... ask if she's taking Bastille day off. She says no. I invite her to a concert and a french party on Bastille day after work on Thurs and she says she already has plans. I say I thought that might be the case, and what about Friday night? Then she says she has a friend coming to visit on Friday getting in at 10pm.

So then I (foolishly) suggest going out tomorrow night, and also tell her that I'm going out with some friends in our neighborhood tonight and she's welcome to join. 

And now she hasn't written back. At this point I know I'm getting too pushy but FUCK THIS IS FRUSTRATING! I'm thinking why did she even ask me if I'm free this weekend if her friend was coming? I mean on one hand the fact that she's even keeping this text dialog going means she has some level of interest, right? But why is she so hesitant to just make a date? I mean, worst case scenario she gets a free meal and never has to talk to me again. Why do women need to play this game? Can I just tell her ""Look. I can't get you out of my mind and I know this is going to sound a little creepy but I would do ANYTHING to see you again in a sober setting.""

If this girl wasn't so damn gorgeous and French I would be so over it. So... did I blow it? What's my next move? Just wait for her to write back?

EDIT: She wrote back, wants to go out Friday at 9:00 or 9:30... says her friend will be getting in around 11:30 or 12:00, so she has her escape route. Works for me.

I started dating someone in my class right around valentine's day, and we had dinner a few times, lunch, etc. She would stay over 3-4 times a week (I couldn't stay there because of a cat allergy). We decided to keep it all pretty casual (both said we didn't want a relationship before finals, she actually brought that up).

Fastforward to right before finals. We're studying at a coffeeshop together, and I make a sarcastic comment about the material when she asks a question. She packs up, and asks me to walk her to her car. Says she doesn't want to do this any more, I say a lot of ""asshole things,"" and I'm stressing her out beyond what she needs for tests. She says we should take a break at least until after all the exams (June).

I think about it, talk to some friends, and decide to try and talk through this. I really liked this girl, so I was going to give it my best shot to fix whatever I had done wrong. We talk a few times, and it culminates with her saying ""i'm over it, i think i've come to terms with not dating you and i don't want to try again""

A few days later, she's in a relationship with another guy.

Now I understand a few things
* She was probably into the guy while dating me, so she was probably lying about at least some of her reasons
* You can't get over someone til you get under someone else (I'm currently dating another girl, and I have another that I'm going to coffee with this week
* I shouldn't be with someone who can't deal with my personality

Why then, I ask, am I still messed up by this? Is it just the feeling of being lied to/having someone else chosen over me? How do you get over someone like this? I've taken the steps to block her FB profile so I don't think about it, but it still irks me from time to time.

A few months ago I got feed up with being single and I tried to piece together what I was doing wrong. I posted a very negative observation about myself and now that I think about it I am not sure how I feel.

Bottom line is I met a girl a few weeks ago. Funny thing is she is a waitress at a bar I frequent. Last time she served me I slid her my card in with the check. Sure enough the next day she texted me a hello. Last Wednesday we went out for some drinks with friends and I think it went well. That night, with my arm wrapped around her, I told her we should get together next week just the two of us. I dont know if it was the booze in her but she said sure. I was wondering if anyone had any idea's on what I should do or how to proceed or just plain advice from here. I am normally off on tuesday and wednesdays.
Its been so long since I have had anyone show me any interest that I do not want to come off as too desperate and turn her off to me.

So here's my question, Reddit.

I met a girl a few months ago when one of my housemate's friends brought over his girlfriend to a party we were having, and she brought over a few of her female friends. She's been to my house a few times for other parties (I live in a college town) and we've had a few brief conversations and I'm pretty sure she doesn't think I'm a total freak. I never really got a chance to pull her aside and ask her to hang out, and I was kind of scared to anyway: if she rejected me it probably wouldn't take long for the guys I live with to find out and more than likely make fun of me for it. I recently decided I don't care about that and want to go for it. We've never talked on facebook but since I don't have her number, that is my only option for communicating with her right now. Does striking up a conversation via an instant messenger and ending it by suggesting that she go on a date with me hurt my chances? Would it be better if I asked her friend for her phone number so I can call her?

He's only in town till Friday. He's visiting some of his friends, and when they're all at work/classes we goof off together.  I'm really falling for this guy, but I don't know if it's creepy to ask for a long distance relationship, or if it even works.

If the date went poorly I could understand this, but when we're ending it with lots of kissing it seems like they had a good time so I'm at a loss.

* Are they expecting the guy to always be the one to send messages?

* Is there some kind of unwritten rule about this?

* Are they trying to play games to see how interested in them I am or what kind of hoops I'm willing to jump through for them?

Some of them have been drop-dead gorgeous so maybe that's the kind of attention they're used to? Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

1299568272.0,1,self.dating,fzlzt,Le boyfriend has a close female friend who is in love with him.  HELP.,3,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/fzlzt/le_boyfriend_has_a_close_female_friend_who_is_in/,"OK, reddit.  Some advice is needed.

I've been seeing my boyfriend for about 9 months now.  We are very keen on each other and so far we've been very happy.  There is one thing about the boyfriend that bugs me though, and that's his female friend (who will henceforth be known as Alice).

Alice has been friends with my boyfriend for about a decade now.  They've never had any romantic entanglements, I can only assume because she's been dating this same guy for forever.  That's right, Alice is taken.

I first met Alice and her boyfriend on the third date with my boyfriend.  It was a double date and I liked her and her boyfriend as much as anyone can like their significant other's friends.  At first she was very warm and inviting, but as time has gone on she has become more and more dismissive of me.  Most of my dates with my boyfriend center around social events that Alice and her boyfriend plan.

Alice and my boyfriend talk all the time, constantly texting.  There will be times when we're all sitting in the room together and he and Alice will be texting each other while myself and Alice's boyfriend sit there waiting for them to be done.  Alice and my boyfriend see each other if not every day, then every other day.  I see him roughly once a week if I'm lucky.  And again, most of that is also when I'm seeing Alice and her boyfriend.  Lately, the invitations to do things have been dwindling.  There will times when I ask the boyfriend what his plans are for a night and he'll say that he has nothing going on but wants a quiet night in, when he'll go and hang out with Alice and her boyfriend.

OK, the friends are less accepting of the girlfriend.  This story is as old as the ages, right?  

That's what I thought until one night when I was spending time with Alice in good faith without the boyfriend when she got rip-roaring drunk and went on a tirade to me about how she wants to be supportive of my boyfriend, and will be there for him no matter what.  She went on to talk about how over the past year they've gotten close and how she loves him.  Then she continues to talk about how I am merely a short-term fixture in his life and that before I knew it I wouldn't be seeing any of them again.

I keep trying to tell myself that she meant that she loves him in the friendly way, not a romantic love.  Like ""I love you man!"" kind of love where the guys chest bump or something afterwards, but I can't shake the feeling that she means something else entirely.

It's not that I object to him having female friends.  Indeed, some boyfriends in the past have had best friends be women, and I was completely OK with it.  I think my concern lies in the fact that he gives preferential treatment to her instead of me, and, you know, she loves him.

I haven't mentioned anything to my boyfriend just yet about how much this bothers me, just because once I do there are potential consequences.  He's been friends with her for a decade.  We've been dating for not even a year.  There is no possible way I can think of bringing my concerns up to him without sounding like a clingy, over-protective harpy.

So, reddit, what do you think?  Is this nothing more than a case of the green-eyed monster?  Should I get over it?  Bring it up?  If I bring it up, how would I go about phrasing my concerns?

TL;DR: Boyfriend has close female friend who loves him, and doesn't particularly like me.  Boyfriend is significantly closer with her than me.",,False,,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,t3_fzlzt,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/fzlzt/le_boyfriend_has_a_close_female_friend_who_is_in/,
1295962152.0,1,self.dating,f8op8,Is this bullshit or what?,1,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/f8op8/is_this_bullshit_or_what/,"So I've been writing back and forth to a girl on PoF.com lately. We've been talking for a couple of weeks, and I thought we were hitting it off. In the last message I sent her, last night, I included my Facebook link, since I didn't want to scare her off by asking for her number (I never did understand that about chicks online. You can be hitting it off and have tons of shit in common, but ask for her number and you'll never hear from her again...)

So in record time (she usually takes about 2-3 days to respond) I get this gem:

&gt;I'm sorry I can't do this right now. I feel like I owe you an explanation because you seem like a nice guy. I orriginally wrote one out but it's really much more than you need to know. Long story short, one of my best friends just hurt me in a way I never expected from him and it reminded me all the reasons I'd rather be lonely than broken.

&gt;Best of luck to you!

My first instinct is that this is bullshit; that she dug around on my Facebook page, saw something that she didn't like, and came up with a bullshit excuse.

However, I'm not always very good about reading people, especially when I haven't yet met them in person. If her friend really did hurt her, then I'd like to try and be supportive. But if she's just being a bitch without the integrity to be honest about what's bothering her, then I don't want anything to do with her.
