It stuck me so much that I had to transcribe it and share.

*Context: they are discussing a religious pamphlet that was distributed with this line:*

&gt;""Carl Sagan would want you to read this."" As if he's our prophet - that's how they think.  That's why when they go after evolution they're going after Darwin, the Prophet of Evolution. Or when they try to build a case against evolution, for example, they do it quote by quote, not study by study or evidence by evidence but quote by quote. That's how they think, that's how they build their case: it's all quotes and authority from the Bible and based upon the authority and rightiousness of whatever from their prophets. It's funny that they reveal how they think when they engage with us, they use their own tactics, as if that's going to be pursuasive to us. and then when we counter that, it's like we're talking past each other, because we're talking logic and evidence.

Recently i have begun debunking them in depth and receiving patently condescending and patronizing responses. So this time i decided to send my response to every recipient of the forward to illicit a real response.

here is the text of the forward followed by the various responses received and sent.
&gt;  Subject: HR 615 - Please forward to everyone you know - 
&gt;     It shouldn't be any simpler than this. If they want it for us, they should have it too.
&gt;   HR 615
&gt;   On Tuesday, the Senate health committee voted 12-11 in favor of a two-page amendment, courtesy of Republican Tom Coburn which would require all Members of Congress and their staff members to enroll in any new government-run health plan.
&gt;
&gt;   Congressman John Fleming has proposed an amendment that would require Congressmen and Senators to take the same health care plan that they would force on us. (Under proposed legislation  are exempt.)
&gt;   Congressman Fleming is encouraging people to go to his Website and sign his petition.  The process is very simple, at:  http://fleming.house.gov/index.html
&gt;
&gt;Senator Coburn and Congressman Fleming are both physicians.  Regardless of your political beliefs, it sure seems reasonable that Congress should have exactly the same medical coverage that they impose on the rest of us.
&gt;
&gt;Please urge as many people as you can to do the same!

my reply:
&gt;The public option is just that, an option. Nowhere in the proposed bill is anything that forcibly takes away anyone's existing private insurance. This mailing insinuates that that is in fact what is happening.
&gt;
&gt;Please cease disseminating false information.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Richard Wright
&gt;
&gt;PS attached are PDF copies of the entire bill currently being debated in the senate, along with a detailed summary for those who feel skimming a 2000 page pertinent document is not for them.

Her demand for me to apologize and send it to not only her, but everyone who received my ""rude reply"":
&gt;Your reply TO ME AND ALL MY FRIENDS is VERY RUDE, Rick and I DO NOT appreciate it. 
&gt; 
&gt;Please send an apology to me and copy all my friends and sign it, your nephew, Rick. Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt;You can request no emails sent to you from me. You do not have the right to tell me what to do, and to copy that to my friends is unbelievably disrespectful. I do not expect that from you, Rick.
&gt; 
&gt;You do not know everything contrary to what you seem to think. The public option will likely put other plans out of business.  You would do well to demonstrate an ounce of respect for your elders. Respect is a basic and will take you far. Disrespect will take you down a very sad road.
&gt; 
&gt;The intent and question I suggest you think about is if the public/government option it is such a great option,Congress should all sign up. That would be putting their money and health where their mouth is and would demonstrate sincerity and integrity that they are doing the best for the American people. I am watching for that and hopefully you are too.
&gt; 
&gt;Aunt Victoria

I have not replied to, or spoken with my aunt yet, but have received several phone calls thanking me or affirming my decision to essentially ""call her out"" in front of her ""friends"".

here is an email i received from a distant relative regarding my reply:
&gt;Richard,
&gt;My mom forwarded your response to me.
&gt;Thank you for your efforts to educate people, or at least encourage them to do a little reflecting and possibly even some research before hitting the ""forward"" key. Ironically, I received this same forwarded email months ago and responded in similar vain trying to point out that the meaning of ""option"" is not synonymous with the definition of ""mandate.""
&gt;
&gt;See you on the 19th at the family Christmas party,
&gt;Greg XXXXX

It would seem that my reply has been circulating around my extended family, whether they are agreeing with me or are upset someone would respond in the manner i choose to is unclear to me. However the fact that my distant uncle would thank me means that my family isnt as full of nutters as i feared.

I felt his thank you warranted a thank you in return.
&gt;Greg,
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your reply, it is encouraging to say the least. It pains me that people don't take the time to educate themselves on important subjects. What pains me more is that people feel comfortable spreading misinformation without the fear of others submitting a dissenting opinion or, god forbid, correcting them in front of their peers. The vitriol i received after sending that message was intense to say the least. However what concerned me more than anything was the demand for an apology; one to be sent not only the sender but to each recipient of my reply as well.
&gt;
&gt;An apology infers that a morally reprehensible act has taken place, it remains my sentiment that correcting misinformation is not an act of this sort. This then implies that the act of potentially embarrassing the sender trumps the act of telling the truth, and indeed the very value of truth. The fact that a copy of the apology was to be sent to every recipient confirms this. Needless to say, the implications of this demand are, in fact, what should be deemed morally reprehensible.
&gt;
&gt;It is my opinion that facts matter more than feelings; that discovering, discerning, and conveying truth is the highest goal. I refuse to accept any other notion and hence feel it is appropriate to, when necessary, perhaps make others uncomfortable in order to convey the importance of truth.
&gt;
&gt;Truth is derived from reality, and an attempt to ignore or misrepresent the truth is an attempt to ignore the realities of the world around us. As Ayn Rand said, ""We can evade reality, but we cannot evade the consequences of evading reality.""  I shiver when I attempt to understand the thought process behind the sort of cognitive dissonance required for the act of observing what is true, yet convincing yourself of something else. I am certain that people who intently and unabashedly spread, or encourage the spread of untruth are the most culpable when the consequences of evading reality eventually come to bear. I am also certain that utilizing deception to advance an agenda is contemptible. The more systematic and purposeful the deception, the more contemptible are the perpetrators.
&gt;
&gt;Truth and the reality it stems from are the axioms of my existence and will not pause when it becomes necessary to correct someone attempting to spread information that contradicts these; moreover I remain unapologetic for doing so.
&gt;
&gt;See you on the 19th indeed.
&gt;
&gt;Richard Wright

It feels good to know that there are others in my family willing to take a stand for honesty and truth. Until now i thought i was the only one who was willing to confront/debate members of my family who spew nonsensical opinions or present lies as truth. 

Hopefully this will result in a change in the family dynamic and open the door for more discussion and debate leading to critical thinking.


**TL;DR my aunt is nuts and has apparently never been confronted for her nonsense publicly. I embarrassed her in front of her target audience and she was SUPER PISSED. Then members of my family secretly thanked me.**

I'm having problems locating the happy medium between how empathy is manipulable, psychotics are probably running some of the most influential offices and positions in our country/world, and how we celebrate both displays of empathy and what it takes to get into a position of power.

I'm framing this in what is probably a false dichotomy,  but I have some bipolar tendencies so these frames of mind flip-flop, sometimes weekly, sometimes hourly. Is there a benefit from experiencing life from both extreme angles, or should somebody like me really try to focus on one or the other? (Cut the losses and choose to be either a nice, empathetic person who risks getting royally f'd over, or adopt a 'balls-to-the-walls' attitude that works his ass off and takes no prisoners.)

I'm guessing the answer is ""Depends on what you want to accomplish"" or ""It's better to manipulate yourself into optimism than become depressed and kill yourself"".

Just looking for other points of view, maybe some discussion resulting in clarity or ideas regarding what I should read to gain better perspective. This shit wears on me sometimes.

EDIT: I cross-posted to [/r/BipolarReddit](/r/BipolarReddit) just because of the specific nature of my question. To be fair, I'd like to look at this from both points of view.

So after a lot of thinking and reading lately on sexism in the US (and a little while of beginning to feel a little like all men are misogynistic; thanks to republican candidates and response articles),  I've finally been able come to this conclusion. It's neither gender against the other as some claim, but society as a whole against everyone at this point. Most people at this point are sexist out of habit and don't even realize how sexist some of their thinking is. Even I sometimes fall into thinking/saying sexist things about both genders, without realizing how sexist it is until I stop and think.

I'm a female going into engineering and often sit in a classroom with at most 5 other women. Many would say that is because women just aren't as interested in engineering/science/math. But this is not necessarily true. We are encouraged as kids to go into a different set of professions then men. By everyone. So for many, math/science/engineering just doesn't enter their list of options. As a kid I was told (while tutoring 5 guys in my class on MATH) that I would make a good teacher. Later that year, a guy doing the same thing was (in my hearing) told he should go into math or science. This sort of pattern is repeated everywhere (i'm sure plenty of girls could share similar stories to mine) and it's made it kind of easy to resent guys. Guys are told they could own businesses and be scientists and girls are told they could teach and be a nurse or a mother or an artist or a writer. I blame *years* of conditioning by a time when sexism was ok in the US. 

I am so glad that the men in my life (and women) encourage me to do well in a career usually thought of as masculine, starting to break the habit of sexist thinking about girls in certain careers. That's what helped me realize that it's not *men* who are sexist. It's society. It's sexist when it causes a person to tell a kid what job they would be good at based on their gender.

There are studies everywhere that show both genders think and problem solve very differently, so in those careers that are mostly dominated by one gender or another, think of all those new ideas and ways of doing things we are missing out on because we think ""Oh, that's a woman's/man's job, a man/woman won't on average do as well in it."" Not true. Just what we've been programmed to think. 

We see each other as walking people, not walking genders, society has to start letting our actions reflect that by changing those erroneous beliefs that men and women are innately better at or more interested in different things. In my experience with talking to my friends (male *and* female) about our interests, our interests and skills are blurred across those areas that supposedly should have dividing lines of gender. hmmm.... 

But I definitely feel better now because I know the men in my life don't look down on me like it was beginning to feel they might.

One man in my life said straight up men are innately better at math and science than women, why else would there be such a huge difference in the men v. women in those careers. Had to explain that sexist norms still keep girls from trying for those careers.  This along with the fuel of the republican candidates plans for women, sparked all this thought and a *lot* of worry.



Tl;dr I was starting to think all guys were sexist pigs and started to hate them a bit. Did some thinking and research and realized guys aren't sexist. We all are because we grow up being taught sexist norms and so think that they must be true. Like men again now.

Edit: some grammar.

Edit2: someone pointed out it sounded like I am saying this is the republicans' fault. Totally not what I meant. I meant that the current remarks and initiatives of many republicans sparked this current train of thought.

Edit 3: Thanks so much for all this discussion. So many good points brought up. And thanks to all the guys who say that girls that they know are just as good in their technical courses. It helps bolster my belief that the sexism (or gaps between men and women) is, in our generation, just a cultural habit that will eventually be pushed out.
One thing that makes me sad is all these arguments about how women *are* not as good as men at stuff. It feels to me that some people are saying, 'well, that sexism you see is totally justified because my studies say it is and so you should get back in the kitchen and make me a sammich.'  Which is the kind of thinking I was trying to not attribute to guys (and people in general). Before, I was hopeful that the cultural habit of gender stereotyping would go away. Now I worry it won't. 
I think it would be much better if we didn't decide an individual's worth based on the studies and statistics. I want to be able to scrap the whole gender discussion and just go, everyone is a person, let them do what they want/are good at on an individual basis. Studying differences allows people to justify prejudice and keep the fences up. Let's stop being divisive? 



FINAL EDIT: All of the discussion has really helped me refine my thoughts on this and where I stand in gender issues. Thanks to WillToHave and the studies they showed me I see that there are differences although not (apparently) in the way many people claim. But seeing these things made me feel that while there are these differences people should be allowed and encouraged as individuals to do whatever they want, whether or not it is a job that would fit their 'gender role.' Jobs and life choices shouldn't (in my mind) be given gender roles, so that people can better choose for themselves, without outside people forcing them into any direction or role. The numbers seem to be a lot of people's excuse to maintain the status quo, but that limits everyone. So conclusion: that studies are interesting side notes but shouldn't make an impact on how you judge an individual.

1346011322.0,71,self.Freethought,yv6r7,Just wanted to extend a friendly invite to everyone here welcoming you to join us over at the new Recovering From Religion subreddit!,107,36,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Freethought/comments/yv6r7/just_wanted_to_extend_a_friendly_invite_to/,"Hi everyone!

Jerry and I did an AMA a few months ago, and after a ton of requests for there to be a subReddit for RR, we've decided to take the plunge and start one: http://www.reddit.com/r/OuRR_World. It is intended to be a safe place for dialogue and questioning religious beliefs, as well as exploring the impact of religion in your life. Where it differs from similar other ""former religion"" subreddits is that this is an overarching ""recovering"" type concept, as opposed to a more denominational/specific focus. The trends and processes of leaving religion are similar across the board, so while there's no doubt a specific focus is helpful as well in finding a common ground of people leaving a specific religion, it's also tremendously valuable to connect with people all over the spectrum who are going through similar challenges personally, and with family and friends.

We do know it's Reddit and there are entire colonies of delightfully argumentative /r/'s to go play in, so we encourage the focus to stay on discussion, disagreement, and decorum in ours...we know it can be done! Also, take a few minutes to check out our website (www.recoveringfromreligion.org), our Facebook fb/recoveringfromreligion, and our Twitter (@Ourr_World) to find a local group near you, learn more about us, what we do, why we do it, and where we are headed from here. For even more information, we are featured on the New York Times this week, and we have a 4 page article about Jerry and RR in the print version that came out today. Also, we are featured in the current issue of American Atheists magazine.

Thanks for taking the time to read about us, and while we're not new to Reddit, we're new to managing a subreddit, so bear with us as we figure it all out together. Hope to see you over there, and feel free to ask if you have questions or need more information.

All the best!
~Sarah

Personally, I don't understand what the protestors want to do. I can see that they are frustrated with the financial situation, and that the distribution of wealth is unfair, but I'm trying to figure out what it is they're trying to do.

Do the protesters simply want to bring this topic to the world, or do they want to change it so the money is more evenly distributed? If they do want to change it, how are they seeking to change the way things are run? (For now) It seems to me that they are just protesting to ""get the message out"", so to speak.

Another thing I noticed is what seems to be a mixed message. Some people really do want to reorganize the financial situation, while others are just trying to vent their dissatisfaction with the current social system. Am I viewing this incorrectly? Is there one central message most (if not all) of the protestors support?

Thank you for reading, and I hope I can gain some clarity at what's going on.

That doesn't stop them from electing the same types of leaders, regardless of the their political beliefs, every four years who keeps on committing the same ethical, moral and downright criminal activities.

They just let them go. 

At what point are the citizens of a country also responsible for the crimes committed by their leaders, by not putting them under the sword for their actions?
