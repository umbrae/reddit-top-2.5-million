I guess I'll start by prefacing the rest of this with a disclaimer: I don't expect answers here, I really just need to vent and the relative anonymity of Reddit makes me feel less uncomfortable about sharing some of the following. A well-played gag (or even pun) may make me feel better or, better still, someone may have an insight I had not considered yet.

And so, my story:

My wife, daughter (11 years old), and I returned earlier today from visiting my parents for Easter. We'd just spent the last 48 hours cooped up in my folks' home and it was a beautiful spring day when we returned, so my wife insisted our daughter go outside and do something while we worked in our garden. Daughter complies and everything's peachy.

After some time, wife &amp; I retire to indoors and have a drink. Wife fetches daughter's laptop at some point to look up a recipe. She opens the lid to be presented, mid-video, with a couple ""in flagrante delicto"". Shocked, she comes to me with this news and we spend some time discussing what should be done about this. While we both agree that there is nothing inherently wrong with sexuality, we also agree that pornography (AT LEAST) creates unrealistic impressions/expectations/role models/etc. for both boys and girls and is really not something an 11-year-old should be watching. A ""talk"" will be had.  At this time, I'm convinced it's some form of evil prank played upon her by a disgruntled classmate or some such.

Wife also mentions ""disturbing"" emails in daughter's email account. A short time ago, after wife and daughter have gone to sleep, I look at the emails and they appear to be replies from some sort of ""social sex"" site. Some digging in both her email and browser history provide me with access to the account at this site that is receiving the attention. That's when the shit hits the proverbial fan.

Her ""profile picture"" is clearly her naked breasts and is clearly taken on her own bed. I recognized the hand drawn cartoons she made and placed some months ago on the wall by her bed. They're in the background of the picture.

I just about vomited.

So, here I am. It's nearing midnight and I can't sleep. My 11-year-old daughter is, apparently, pretending to be a sex-starved, 19-year-old bi-sexual, is receiving emails from strangers trying to set up meetings and, worst of all, is responding (though never with details or any sort of agreement to meet, thank God.)

Still pretty freaked out and debating when to wake up wife and discuss this. I don't think I'm going to sleep tonight.

**TL; DR;** 11-year-old posts naked pic on sex site. Her dad is freaking the fuck out.

I deleted the post because I was too depressed. This is obviously a throw away account. I think I can provide proof if people really want it. Just ask and I'll message the mods or something (not sure how it works).

The story is very complicated, but I will try to keep it brief. 

In 2008, my father finished his project after years of work. He had invested everything we had into the company. Because he had no funding to launch his first run, he signed a printing and distributing deal with a print broker of a Chinese printer to handle the first run.

The print broker, fully aware of our lack of financial means, lied about the nature of his company, manipulated our contract, reneged on his obligations, and attempted to strong arm my dad into giving him half-ownership of the company. When my dad refused, the print broker fabricated civil charges against him and me (I was a minor during the entire dispute, had absolutely no role in the company and has never even met the broker, I was 16 at the time and had never worked for the company a day in my life) and sued us for $300,000, the remaining inventory, and the intellectual property.

We fought him for four years. With no money for food, rent, or anything else, we lived off of donations and whatever money I could make while studying at University.

In October 2012, after four years of fighting, we lost. We spent a large portion of the suit unrepresented because we could not afford legal protection. The few lawyers who tried to help us ended up hurting us more by failing to respond to a series of admissions that greatly damaged us. 

Luckily, they did not win control of the inventory and the IP. I, however, am now $300,000 in debt to the evil man who ruined our lives. I did absolutely nothing. I am graduating in May with hefty student loan debt and trying to find a job in the public sector to pursue my dreams, but I am constantly stressed and anxious because I have nowhere to turn to for help. We have no money for food or rent and are running out of options.

Maybe this post wont go anywhere, just like the last one a couple years ago. Some people suggested I go to a legal aid clinic. I've been to tons. This is all too complicated for them. I don't know what else to do. Thanks if you took the time to read all of this.

This month, after dozens of phone calls, emails and government online forms I realize what so many in the United States have been talking about. For some people, it is next to impossible to get adequate healthcare in this country. 


After waking up at 4am this morning to see my beautiful soul mate curled up on the bathroom floor shaking from the relentless muscle spasms and watching her cry for hours because of the horrific pain in her legs and feet, it really hit home. America can spend $1 trillion in tax money on wars, killing people who earn less than $2/day but we can't allocate a portion of those same tax dollars to a national healthcare plan to help people right here at home? Really?


My wife and I are both in our 30's. We found out a few years ago that she has acquired a rapidly progressing form of Multiple Sclerosis. This means she will eventually become completely paralyzed and will be unable to walk, move or swallow food.


After losing her job, we were left without health coverage. Now that we only have one income (mine), after the mortgage, utilities and food, there simply isn't anything left. We don't use credit cards, our car is paid for, and we have no real expenses other than the basics of life. 


THE QUESTION:
Our family brings in about 35k/year so, (unfortunately) we're above the poverty line and can't get any welfare benefits. She applied for state disability but was denied. 


Can anybody show me how the Obama healthcare plan can help us (or just her)? Are there any options I may have missed? Is there any information Reddit could share to help my suffering wife get the ongoing medicine and treatment she needs in order to live with some dignity? There is no way she can go on like this.

1290627401.0,58,self.needadvice,eb9ht,"I'm a scientist, got canned for uncovering misconduct...feeling completely lost here, what the eff do I do?",65,7,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/eb9ht/im_a_scientist_got_canned_for_uncovering/,"I can't provide full detail for obvious reasons...but here is the general gist of my situation:

I'm a research scientist and joined my current lab (or now, former lab) at a large research university less than a year ago.  The hierarchy in the lab is pretty typical: main P.I./Director (head-bossman), multiple secondary P.I.s (including my primary supervisor - miniboss), then the postdocs/fellows/research scientists/grad students (the category that I fall into), and lab techs/support staff.  

The minibosses are mostly young investigators, which means that their primary goal is to publish often, and publish big. (for you non-scientists, this is how one builds a career in research...you need publications to get grant funding to pay for research to get publications, and so on.  Ergo the saying ""publish or perish”)
Most of them are MDs.  My miniboss fits this stereotype to a T...driven workaholic, focused on career-success, but also one of the most arrogant, control-obsessed individuals I have ever met.  He *does not* like to be told that he is wrong, esp. by those lower than him on the totem-pole.  As I've learned, the fact that I have more lab-experience, and more ""field specific"" education/experience than he does, does not exclude me from this.

So basically, a while back I started analyzing some old data and repeats of experiments for miniboss, that were done prior to my time in the lab.  I found that my results did not match up with his previous results.  No big - I showed my findings to miniboss, and being a scientist and all I thought that we would just repeat the experiments again, and/or rethink the original hypothesis and try to explain my findings.  Instead, I was told ""the experiments didn't work"" and ""you messed something up"".  This really hit a nerve; so, I went back through old raw-data to reanalyze and compare my results to those that had already been published.  Again, mine where nearly the opposite of what miniboss had originally found.  Optimistically (naively), I hoped that he would appreciate my extra effort and at least consider my ideas, rather than just seeing it as me trying to prove him wrong.  No such luck - he trashed my work (literally) and said that he would do the analyses himself.  

Cutting down a very long story - from that point on, working for him became a miserable experience. I won't go into much detail, but suffice it to say I was not surprised when I heard months later from co-workers that he had been looking for ways to fire me.  Thing is, I really *really* loved the other research that I was working on in the lab, and everyone else that I worked with.  As delicately as I could, I discussed my situation with head-bossman.  Things had gotten somewhat better recently, when I was given more freedom to work on my own projects and those outside of the umbrella of miniboss. 

Then, I came into work on Monday and was told by miniboss to pack up my things and to go meet with HR.  Apparently, months ago he had asked them to do a super turbo-background check to make sure that every ""i"" was dotted and ""t"" was crossed in my paperwork.  Yeah, they found an inaccurate date on an old CV they had on file, which I had apparently signed and given to them at some point after I was hired ""for their records"".  In their eyes technically this was ""providing inaccurate information"". They said that there was no way around this one, despite that I have references, current coworkers, former coworkers, etc. all vouching for me, and a valid explanation (admittedly, I regularly sign documents without reading a word on them or giving them a second thought…lesson learned).  
Canned.  Banned from ever working for said University again. To be honest, the stress of the whole ‘compromising my ethical beliefs’ thing was slowly killing me, but I had hoped to get a position under a different miniboss following grant-season. 

I was in complete shock...still am, my head is still spinning.  Now, accusing someone of data-falsification and scientific misconduct is a *huge* deal...you're pretty much blacklisted in the scientific community if you're proven to have falsified data, etc.  Its not like I wanted to end this guys career - and even trying to accuse him of this stuff, I thought I would have been dragged into a huge shitstorm myself.  But I also knew enough to cover my own ass as much as I could as soon as I realized what I might be getting myself into.  I had met with the university ombudsman last spring, shortly after the whole mess started, to try to figure out how to handle the ethical dilemma of ""do what’s right and report this guy"" or ""shut up and do what’s best for myself"".  They have a fully transcribed record of our conversation, where I told them just about everything at the time.  I also previously spoke at length about the situation (in confidence) with two close professors of mine, work in other departments at the same university.  I briefly reported my initial concerns to HR a few months ago, so they have a record of that as well…they had actually warned me of an impending shitstorm if I chose to pursue the matter further through the research regulatory board.  I also have backups, and backups of backups, of all of the relevant raw-data and yet unpublished results.  As additional ""backup evidence"", and because I never assume that *I* am 100% right about *anything*, a while back I had solicited the help of individuals in other departments, who have much more experience this type of lab stuff/data analysis than I do, to review my data and results.  Many of my coworkers were aware of the situation and had seen this stuff too, but everyone is just trying to protect their own jobs (understandably so).

Soooo…Advice? Thoughts? What the eff do I do from here? If I keep my mouth shut and let the whole thing go, I can apply for jobs elsewhere and probably salvage a cordial recommendation from miniboss and headboss.  I’m also planning on applying for professional programs next year – losing a career-reference would be a major blow to my application, and would raise questions.  Yet, I got myself into this mess in the first place because I believed that *what he was doing was wrong*.  I’m losing faith in science ☹

tl;dr – I stood up for my ethical beliefs and got canned for it, my next move could be career-altering…what the eff do I do?

And it's definitely a weird feeling. College was a period of ups and downs. It took me a while to really get settled in. My first two years were tough. I was adjusting to leaving friends and family, making new friends, living in a new city, schoolwork, my long distance girlfriend and figuring out what to make of my new-found freedom. Standard stuff, I suppose, but it was really stressful and overwhelming for me.

My second two years were much better. I moved out of the dorms. Really got involved in a student organization and could see my schoolwork leading somewhere. But now, all of the sudden, it's over. It all just seems so sudden. And I guess that's what's getting to me. A few months ago, graduation seemed a long ways off. I was just partying with friends, doing schoolwork and enjoying myself. And then I came back from spring break, and I realized that it was nearly over.

So many friendships that are still developing are being cut short. I *really* like some of my friends, but in some cases we met just a semester ago, and it seems way too soon to go our separate ways. The last 2 weeks or so, I've tried to hang out with these people as much as possible, but it just makes me realize that I can't really make up for lost time. Which leads to a feeling of regret.

I regret not finding a good friend group sooner. Not exploring campus more. Not pushing my boundaries more. It seems like there are a million different things I could have done or made of college, and in comparison, it seems like I've accomplished so little. 

Even the end of classes was a weird feeling. Nobody said ""You're done! This university has now prepared you to go forward with your life and career."" Instead, one day, I was just done. Just didn't have to show up anymore. And I guess that means I'm an engineer now? I just kind of feel like I've been left hanging.

But at the same time, I feel ready to move on. I'm ready to move out of my college house. To not live with 7 other roommates. To not be restricted to the ""campus bubble"". To go back home and be with my friends and family.

It's very conflicting. I guess It's just scary to know that this is the end. I'm done with college. Close the book on it. When people talk about their ""college days"", these will be my stories, for better or worse.

What I chose to do as a career I've realized is opposite of my personality. Staying in a lab looking at the same people every day, with no changes, is driving me crazy. I currently work at a blood processing center, but I'm not doing anything that I studied for. All I do is follow the same procedure every day, working in Quality Assurance. It's 90% paperwork. I check test results, calibrate different precision instruments, I check orders that go out to companies, and ensure we follow FDA regulations so we don't get fined. 

Despite my education, the time that I've been working there, the effort that I've put in, and the additional training and added responsibilities they've put on me lately, I've seen no pay raise. Despite my ask for a promotion or change in department, there's a glass ceiling that I can't break through.

I've also thought that I should go back to school, but I don't want to do that either. When I was in grade school, I felt my purpose was to graduate and go to college, get my degree. After I got my undergrad degree, they said, ""go to grad school."" After grad school, they said, ""get a job."" Now, 5 years after getting a job, I don't know what to do.

I'm completely unhappy and don't know what to do? I keep meeting people who LOVE what they do. I want to be a part of that club too, but I've found difficulty finding that thing I'm passionate about. I used to be passionate about science and lab research, but my morale has been shot lately. I'm caught in a rat race that I can't escape.

But I also feel bad when I don't want to go to work, because there are so many out there, because of these bad economic times, who don't have a job and can't pay for a house/apartment, and they don't have health insurance and benefits like I do. I'm grateful and miserable at the same time.

On top of this, I hate the city I live in. As a military child, moving around the world constantly, I've had the benefit of being a cultured individual, but the population I'm surrounded by is full of ignorant uncultured people who I don't enjoy being around, and I have difficulty finding like minded individuals. I've applied to other jobs in different cities but with no bites. 

My younger brother, who turned me to Reddit for advice on my issue, keeps telling me to go north west to Seattle or Portland. And I've thought about moving to DC, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, but I don't feel confident just up and moving without a plan.

What is the value of happiness? I wish I could just up and leave, but I have no job security, confidence, and not enough savings to survive for a few months while I get resettled elsewhere. Plus I have student loans out the AAASSSSS!!!

So Reddit, my question is this. Have you ever up and quit your job, responsibilities, ability to pay your bills, in an attempt to seek personal sanity? Were you depressed because of your job? What did you do to change your situation? 

What do you do when you don't know what to do, when you don't see a light at the end of the tunnel?

There has to be more to life than this, yet I can't seem to find the answer.

I recently moved to a small town with my parents where I have been having an excruciatingly difficult time making a single friend. I have one sister (21), who lives about 6 hours away. She's not very emotionally stable, nor is she the most rational person, and I would *really* rather not get her involved in this situation.

Now... My dad used to be an alcoholic around the time I was born. He realized it was destroying his life, and quit drinking when I was still very young. He thought he could control himself, started having a beer or two with dinner when I was around fifteen, but soon started binging so he ""quit"". Since, he has been secretly drinking every day after work. My mom has no idea that he comes home drunk every day. I would tell my mom, but it would cause a major fight, and I feel she is too emotionally unstable at this point to deal with that. I know my father, and his attitude towards it will be ""DAMNIT I MAKE THE MONEY AND I WORK ALL DAY I DESERVE SOMETHING TO DRINK AFTER WORK.""


On top of that, my dad has been spending hundreds of dollars on mail order bride sites. I think he plans to divorce my mom after I move out, and marry a mail order bride. He is doing this in a time of a bit of a financial crisis our family is having. After noticing him quickly closing windows when I walked into the room, I installed a keylogger and got all of his passwords to his mail order bride sites and I've been reading all of his back and forth letters, going through his transactions etc with the mailorder bride sites. He is cheating on my mom over these sites. (Talking dirty, planning his future life with certain girls, etc) In his correspondence he claims that he divorced in 2002. Also, I found by going through his prior transactions that he has been on at least a couple of these sites since 2008.

My mom doesn't have a job, and hasn't worked in 20 years. She's been a stay-at-home-mom since my sister was one. The past years, she seems to have grown increasingly unstable, and I know through my sister that she's now going through menopause, which has made her emotions go a bit... crazy. I don't think she could handle knowing any of this, let alone cope with fighting with my dad over it, or divorce.

My dad is a crazy conservative type, and has stockpiles of knives and guns and what not. While I don't feel I'm in any immediate danger living here, I'm nervous about confronting him about any of this. There's no way of knowing what he would do when confronted with the fact that I know secrets of his that would ruin his family, marriage, career... everything.

My mom is rather depressed about me moving out soon, and if she lost her husband on top of me leaving, I fear she could go as far as suicide... 

I've never been one to ask for help on anything, but this is beyond me. I feel completely alone, and have absolutely no idea what to do at this point.

Any advice or kind words would be appreciated.

Prior to living with me her home life was very strict and she would be upbraided for not saying yes/no sir or ma'am even during casual conversation with an adult. I disagreed with this and once she came to live with me I was much more liberal and allowed her more freedoms such as a 9:00 bedtime instead of 8:00 and allowed her to access the internet with the caveat that I monitored who she talked to and what sites she visited. 

For the first year everything was pretty normal, but as she progressed through puberty she started displaying inappropriate behavior. She would intentionally expose her breasts to me, come out and sit on my lap in bra and panties, and once crawled into bed with me completely nude in the middle of the night. I have talked to her several times about specific behaviors always taking the approach that she hadn't done anything wrong but that it wasn't appropriate behavior. Besides crawling into my bed nude I considered it normal behavior for a teen girl, like she was getting a kick out of being ""naughty"". I spoke with her therapist about it and she agreed that it was relatively normal behavior for a teen in her situation and that my reactions were pretty much spot on. I don't know if they ever talked about it as I want her to have the ability to talk about anything during therapy without feeling pressured to reveal what she talked about.

We have recently moved and I haven't put her back into therapy yet as I haven't had time to find a therapist I liked. However this past few weeks things have been getting really strange. I was tickling her and she made a comment that me tickling her was the same thing as raping her, but was smiling when she said it. She then tried to goad me into tickling her again but I was pretty disturbed by her comment so I told her it wasn't appropriate and she was to old to be tickled anymore. She also came out last week and sat down on the couch and propped her legs up on me while wearing a skirt with no panties and I felt like she was intentionally exposing herself to me. I also caught her looking at ""school girl"" pornography a few days ago. I grounded her from the computer and we had a huge argument and she's been mopey ever since. Last night she came in my room at about 9:30 and was crying and telling me she was sorry. I sat there holding her telling her it was okay and we'd work through this and she ended up falling asleep. I threw an blanket over her and went to bed myself. I had a dream that she was whispering to me and woke up to her masturbating next to me and I swear she was saying ""daddy"". I immediately made a noise and she stopped. I kind of stretched and stood up and went to the bathroom and came back out and she was pretending she was asleep so I shook her a bit and told her she needed to go to her own room. I didn't say anything to her this morning but I am seriously freaked now.

As far as I know she has never been sexually abused, besides this her behavior is completely normal. She gets straight A's at school is on the soccer team and part of an after school musical. She hasn't had any serious boyfriends and when she has gone on ""dates"" it has always been with an adult present. Also due to her schedule she doesn't ever just ""hang out"" so I am pretty sure she is still a virgin. The few times I've talked to her about it I've told her at any point she could have me take her to the doctor to get on birth control no questions asked and no recriminations. She has told me she ""masturbates and has french kissed two of her boyfriends but that's it."" 

As for me, I live a pretty normal single parent life, I have had a few casual girlfriends and gone on dates, but haven't had anyone click. I do have female friends that are involved in my daughter's life, but try to keep my casual dates from meeting her as I don't want females rotating in and out of her life like her mom's boyfriends did. I shouldn't have to say this, but I have never once encouraged any inappropriate behavior from her and have always kept myself as her dad and not her buddy or pal.


After last night I am really at a loss, I want to get her back into therapy immediately but don't want to make her feel horrible about herself. I don't plan on bringing up that I caught her as that would be a horrible conversation to have. However I am a little worried that if I take her to a therapist I could end up under some kind of investigation which is the last damn thing I need. Are there therapist who deal with sexual issues like this for children? Would discussing my fears with a therapist require them to report it to CPS? Obviously if she has been abused at some point I want that reported but I really don't want CPS crawling around in my life treating me like some kind of potential child molester because of this.

Edit: TL'DR My daughter has been behaving inappropriately towards me culminating in her masturbating in my bed moaning daddy while I was sleeping. Want to find a therapist who deals with these issues and don't want CPS investigating me when I haven't done shit.


EDIT: Cross posting to AskReddit so I can hopefully get some more feedback

I'd love to get some female advise on this as well, particularly if there are any females out there who had similar fantasies. 

Edit: I have an appointment to talk with a therapist who says she has dealt with teens who have sexual issues before. Going to lay it all out and see what she thinks.

Edit: Went and talked with the therapist, we are going to do a joint session with my daughter and lay out the inappropriate behavior without bringing up what might be causing it. Just a joint session to lay down some boundaries and expectations. She's never dealt with an issue like this before where the inappropriate behavior went so far so we are going to let it (the incest fantasy issue) slide at first. She brought up the abuse angle and asked a lot of questions about her mom and mom's boyfriends as well as our home life and lots of questions about my romantic life.",,False,,t5_2r367,True,,,True,t3_btapu,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/btapu/i_think_my_daughter_is_having_incest_fantasies/,

We are doing some major renovations to our place, contractor has $80,000 of our money (2/3 of the full payment). Everything was fine and dandy, he seemed like a really trustworthy guy (yes I know, typical rookie mistake).

About 2 weeks ago, he stopped showing up with his team for work. Could not reach him by phone, text, email. Just zero replies.

I created a fake e-mail address and sent him an e-mail asking for a quote for a potential big project, and he replied within the hour. This guy was definitely doing something sketchy.

I've been trying to reach him for all this time, and finally he calls me today and tells me that he can come by tomorrow (Saturday). I have been consulting with my lawyer and am planning to sue him, but I've been advised the best thing is to simply try to be nice and hope he finishes the job.

The news gets even worse... 2 weeks ago before he stopped replying to me, he forwarded me an e-mail from the manufacturer of some of the materials we need to finish -- saying that there's going to be a delay and to apologize to his client (me). I called this company and found the guy who had apparently written this, he says he never wrote this and has no recollection of this at all. So... I know I'm pretty much being scammed.

Also, (yes it gets worse), I found the guy who he had mentioned he was also doing work for, and it turns out this guy is ALREADY in the process of suing this dirtbag for doing the same thing to him (he's 3 months behind on his project).

Three months ago I met a decent enough seeming girl.  We went out drinking and we were going at it pretty hard.  Later, she told me she had tricked me and was not actually drinking everything which would explain why I was waaaay more drunk then her, and though I can't really remember it, ended up sleeping with her that night.  In the morning I wake up in a stupor with her in my bed.  Check my status, we used a condom, thank god.  It's broken, oh shit.  The night before she told me she was on the pill.  Turns out, she's not.  We rush to the clinic for the morning-after pill.  She takes it and feels shitty so I let her hang around.  She then refuses to take the second dose.  I have to sit and watch her fake take twice before finally actually taking it.  Though later she tells me she threw it up.  And she must of, or it didn't work, because I tell her I really don't want to see her again (because of this whole ordeal, and now on day 2 she's clingy and won't leave.)  Calls every day.  Waits for me at my apartment.  I get people close to me involved because I don't know what to do.   

She disappears for a month.  Then turns up again with a surprise.  She's pregnant.  I am shocked.  Can't believe this.  One time, one fuck up.  I tell her I'm sorry but I can't do this.  I'm not making decisions for you, and have the kid if you want, but I really can't. (Yes, I'm a terrible person.)  
She ends up getting an abortion and is apparently really stressed about it.  Three weeks go boy and a strange man appears on my doorstep asking if I know this girl.  She's at my front door in a wheelchair.  She tried to kill herself with pills, and then jumped into traffic.  The angry man tells me to apologize.  I'm more panicked than I ever have been in my life.  I apologize and she asks if we can be friends, and I repeat that I'm sorry, I really can't do that.  Her friend promises he's taking care of her and she is sad but says she sees the world in a new light and is working hard every day.  
Later I get emails asking to hang out and give paid English lessons, and I simply tell her again that I am not interested in hanging out.  I wish her the best and tell her to please leave me alone.  

Then about an hour ago I got an email from the same friend of hers that showed up at my door.   

Apparently last night she took her own life.  
I'm in a state of shock right now.  This girl had driven me to the brink of a meltdown, and I had apparently done the same.  I felt unsafe with her stalker-ish behaviour and that's why I asked her to leave me alone, but I realize I have been less than a gentleman in this situation.  I can't really control what decisions people make, but now I feel like I have someone's life on my hands and it's unbearable.  I don't really have anyone to talk to about this so I'm coming here.  What do I do?  Can I be arrested for this?  I just feel like throwing up.

EDIT: I know most pepper who have commented wont see this, but thank you. I feel really bad for what happened and I could have acted better, but ultimately it was her choice.

Also, I am not sure if I should give it to the instructor, his superiors or my fellow classmates... advice appreciated.

""Today in class while discussing the difficulties of designing a building to satisfy the thermal comforts of all of its occupants, you suggested that personal comforts are dependent on a variety of considerations such as; the amount of clothing being worn, metabolism and how much exercise the person gets- you continued, pointed to me and said in stride: “and you don’t exercise enough”. Making that snapshot comment based solely on my physique is synonymous with you calling me fat and doing so in front of my peers is the very definition of bullying. 
I understand that I am overweight and I alone have to deal with the complexities that are associated, including having to deal with ill-mannered, obtuse people such as you. You don’t know me. You have no right to speak in any way on behalf of my physical condition. You have no insight into my life and were way out of line. Your lack of formal educator training is no excuse for your absence of decency.
While this may be common in adolescence, I shouldn't have to explain to a lecturer at a liberal college such as XXXYYY State why what you said to me was improper. I was shocked, appalled and embarrassed by your comment. At the time I did not know how to retort to such an obviously inappropriate remark and I therefore did not get the opportunity to defend myself or any others who may have been made uncomfortable by the threat of public ridicule that you imposed. 
I had hoped that maybe at break you would have apologized, as I did react with a very exasperated ‘thank you’ in response and I had anticipated you to be cognizant enough to realize that you had indeed been rude and offensive. You did not. Perhaps you believe you are above the rest of us that abide by the guidelines of civility, perhaps it was a fluke. Regardless, you need be aware that such a statement in a public forum and without familiarity is intolerable.   
I had real optimism for our new instructor. Unfortunately, on day one, you managed to alienate and disappoint me already.""

Alas, I turn to the anonymous input Reddit for consultation and the inevitable grammar correction (it's like having thousands of proof readers!).

Thank you Reddit. BTW- first post!

TL:DR; got called a fatty in front of the class by college professor. Upset, I penned a letter expressing my anger, now I'm not sure who to give it to, if anyone, or if I am overreacting.

*edit; Thank you all for your responses, I needed a objective opinion and I appreciate them all. As most of you have suggested I shall refrain from using the letter and will let him know in his office hour that I was embarrassed by his comment and will not be emotionally tied to the outcome of that conversation. As some have pointed out, I do indeed have 'issues' that need working on and weight is only one of them. Obviously appropriate emotional response is another, and this type of clairvoyance is what I came to Reddit for. Thanks again

My mom found out he dropped out of university (went into pre-med, supposed to graduate this year but he hated it or IDK what happened really, left) and now he just sits at home and does nothing (more so than he used to).
 
We were never close and he doesn't really talk to me- disapproves of my ""materialistic"" lifestyle, thinks I'm technologically challenged and too ignorant about all the computer specs and the conspiracy theories of the world. For some reason, it worked out so that we went to different schools since kindergarten then he went to some computer science HS and I went to liberal arts specialized school. We share no hobbies: my interests are culinary arts, fitness, art&amp;design and he doesn't like eating or exercising. He blocked me on skype. I'm really busy these days with university application - exercising in the morning, then usually at the library or art class until late, so I see him like once a week if I'm lucky. The only time we really ""talk"" is when I ask him to fix my computer, printer or wifi, or I tell him to come downstairs to eat food (he'd come down, take food, return to his computer) Now I just leave food on his table and it gradually disappears.

My dad lives on the other side of the Earth, quite literally, and doesn't really give a fuck about us. I spoke to him last when I was in grade 7.

He was never a part of any kind of social organization and I've never heard of or seen his friends (he claims he has none). My mom keeps insisting I take him to go see a movie or something but I don't think he really cares for films. [I suggested professional help but they're both against it.] We don't even eat the same type of food, he only eats pasta and fried rice and refuses to eat any new recipes I try: ""WHAT DIS? DO NOT WANT"". I recently came across website he runs or sth where he posts StarcraftII game strategies videos and stuff. I asked him if that's what he wants to do, but doesn't seem like it either. Mom keeps telling him to go to college to learn a skill or sth but he doesn't want to. I don't know what the hell he even wants to do. 

I think he's really lost. And I know sometimes when others are trying to help you, you just want them to go away. So like how do you go about helping someone like that?

For 10+ years, I've been with the same woman.  We married several years ago, and we have a daughter.  A few years into this, her parents became ""deeply religious"", and I have humored them, as I try to just let people be who they are and not try to convert them to my way of thinking.  The whole, live and let live strategy, you know?  

So, in recent years the wife has gone down this road as well.  It started small, and now I'm losing all my money to the various TV Evangelists who all seem to need money.  God apparently has a massive amount of debt, and now so do I.  A lot of this happened without me knowing, as my job requires me to travel much of the year, and I depended on her to manage the finances from home.  
She doesn't work, which doesn't help, and has ballooned to twice her pre-married weight.
Now, all she wants is another kid, but I'm not into it.  I'm not into her, but I'm trying to do the right thing for my daughter.  She is my heart and soul, and that fact makes my wife jealous more than you could fathom.  
I don't find her attractive, she does nothing useful, and I cannot even get sleep at night because she wants to stay awake watching television, since she doesn't get out of bed  until 9.  
But, what may be the last straw has finally happened:  I don't make a lot of money, but I did ok before all the debt.  I've been saving for my daughter a PS3 since July when I found out she wanted one (I was a gamer as a kid, so I know how much this would make her Christmas special).  So, the wife apparently sent my $455 I had saved to some TV preacher, just this weekend, apparently.  I found out when I went to get the cash out of my hiding place, which I guess wasn't the best hiding place after all.

So Reddit, what do I do?  Divorce is looking obvious, but now my credit is going to be screwed.  I don't want to lose my daughter, as I travel so much I only see her a weekend here and there during the year and for a month during the holidays, when business is slow.  I'm at my wits end, and I don't know who to ask about this type of thing.  I've obviously gotten myself into this, but how do I get out?

1337467150.0,34,self.needadvice,tv92h,My 34yo sister is slowly killing my parents with her actions and they don't know how to cope.  Please help.  Details inside.,43,9,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/tv92h/my_34yo_sister_is_slowly_killing_my_parents_with/,"First off, this is a throwaway, as some of my friends know the situation and I like to keep my main username private.  

Reddit,
I need some help.  Actually, it's my whole family that needs help.
I no longer have a decent relationship with my mother or father, and it's because of my sister.  
She's 34 and still lives at home.  As a matter of fact when my parents moved into another house a few years ago, she moved with them and gets to stay in the included appartment over the garage, rent free.  I live on my own, and have so for the past 6 years.  When I thought about trying to go back to school and move in their basement so i wouldn't habe to work full time to pay my mortgage, I was told I couldn't.  That's right, I can't move in with them to try and better myself, but she gets to live there rent free, and doesn't help out with any bills.  My mom cleans her appartment, washes her clothes, etc.  At night when my dad is trying to sleep for work, my sister walks across the porch into their house and watches TV, eats their food and is loud and wakes my dad up almost every night.  

My parents are losing their minds.  She has a ""job"" at the family business, but she has never once been on time.  This is not an exageration, never once been on time.  My mom has threatened to ""fire"" her, but she never does.  She's never had to have any type of responsbility and my parents won't kick her out because they know she will go to her grandmother's (our mom's mom) to stay, and she will not tell her no.  She has never told her no.  In addition to living at my parents' house rent free, she also has her $120 cell phone bill paid by my grandmother.  I pay for my own.  She has no bills to pay for.  All she basically does is order clothes online and get manicures and pedicures.  This isn't even the worst part yet.  

She has ordered thousands of dollars of clothes online, using my grandmother's credit cards.  If I had to guess, I'd say it's at least $5,000 worth of stuff, all at different times.  My grandmother has had to change the numbers probably 5-6 times and each time they ask if she wants to press charges and each time she says no.  She tried to open up a charge card in my mom's name to order more clothes and my mom actually did call and tell them she didn't authorize an account to be opened in her name and so they closed it.  Well, my sister then tried to do it again and it got declined.  

Recently, she was at my grandmother's house and one of her credit card statements was laying on the table and my sister got this information and bought $300 worth of clothes online.  Somehow the order went through without the security code or the expiration date.  Again, my grandmother refused to press charges and just changed the number again.  

A lot of the reasons for my parents and grandmother not doing anything to try and stop this, is because she threatens to kill herself if they do.  This puts addes stress on my parents and so they just basically let her do whatever she wants while they slowly die inside, and they are dying, at least in spirit.  They have no hope of anything getting better.  I asked them what else she would need to do to make them wake up and realize that they have to do something drastic to stop this or it will continue, and their answer is ""I don't know.""  They aren't the same people they were years ago.  My mom, who used to be a pretty person to be around has probably aged 15 years in the past 5 years and is just a shell of herself.  She calls my mom probably 25-30 times a day and orders her around.  My mom can't get anything done around the house because she is constantly answering the phone.  My dad cries all of the time because he's so miserable and sleep deprived.  He says many mornings on the way to work that he feels like he could doze off at any moment.  She calls my mom a bitch daily and tells her stuff like that she wants to push her off the top deck of their house when they are arguing.  She told my grandmother the other day that she would drive her car through a tree if she didn't get the clothes she ordered.  

She also can't keep a relationship.  The last real relationship she was in ended because of how she acted and he didn't even know the majority of it.  She would do things like cause a huge scene at Thanksgiving dinners because the football game would be on and her boyfriend was supposed to turn his head if cheerleaders were on TV.  If he didn't she would check to see if he had a hard on.  He had to promise her he wouldn't watch TV if he was home and she wasn't there.  This was about 4-5 years ago, so she was acting this way at around 30 years old.  Since that ended, she has bacially gone out with anybody who will give her any type of attention.  

I've tried to intervene.  I've gotten packages of stuff she has ordered and sent it back so my grandmother would get a refund.  Even when I try to do these things, my parents tell me not to.  They don't want to make it an issue, because in their minds if my sister is somewhat happy from getting stuff she's ordered, that it makes it easier on them.  If I go visit my parents and I lock all of the doors in their house so my sister can't come over and cause a scene, my parents go and unlock them because they say she will beat on the door or break the glass out, which she actually has done before.  Surprise, no cops were called for her vandalising their property.  

At this point, I am just wondering if there is anything that I can do, to make this a legal issue to where she could maybe be sent to some sort of mandated counseling or even some type of ""boot camp"" type detention center.  If my grandmother won't press charges, can I alert the authorities so maybe she can be charged by the state?  What she needs is for someone to discipline her.  She's never had that.  My parents use the excuse that ""she old enough to know right from wrong"" which is true, but she's also conditioned to be this way, as there have never been any true reprecussions for her actions.  She has most people fooled.  Her ""friends"" wouldn't ever beleive that she acted this way.  She puts on a front around them and actually has a lot of them fooled into thinking my parents are awful people.    
What I've told in this post is probably close to 20% of all the stuff she's actually done.  I just felt like it was getting long-winded and felt like it was enough to paint a picture of the situation.  

Does anyone have any advice on how I can make this better?  I know that my parents are to blame for their lack of discipline, but I also feel like she may have some sort of mental issue, maybe she's a sociopath or has some sort of personality disorder?  

I just know we need help, or I feel like I am going to be burying my parents within the next 5 years from all the stress that she causes.

(Long as all hell, 4 years of shit I need to get off my chest)",36,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/emtfr/so_i_admitted_to_myself_and_my_close_friends_that/,"So, here I am, an admitted alcoholic, but I do not think I need to attend AA. I know the underlying issues as to why I drink, and am very self-aware and self-critical. I want to stop drinking, there is no question that I cannot indulge in it anymore as it has hurt me and the people around me. It has ruined so much. You'll see what I mean, but I still need input. Here's the requisite backstory:

I'm 22, Canadian, unemployed, and not in school quite yet. I started drinking relatively late, at 18. This was January 2007. I had a deal with my parents that if I didn't drink or do drugs until 18 they'd compensate me handsomely. Fast forward to 18, I stick to my word and come out with about a grand and a macbook courtesy of mom and pop. I buy a quarter pound of weed and sort of got into selling (more on this later), and hit the sauce with my buds virtually days after I had turned 18. I was in the middle of grade 12 at the time, but I only had one class that last semester and it was english which was no problem. I loved getting drunk. I loved everything about it, it made me sociable, confident, etc, apparently how it starts out for everyone. I didn't have a job through highschool, so drinking wasn't frequent especially because I was one of the first kids to turn 18 and no one went to bars, but it was always heavy when it did occur. I graduated fine, but opted to not return to post secondary due to feeling like I missed out on the party years of highschool, with me not drinking and getting fucked up like my friends did. 

My first major fuck up drinking was me getting arrested for graffiti and possession of prohibited dangerous weapon (brass knuckles) while completely hammered. I woke up in a holding cell covered in blood, vomit, and dirt. I had apparently ran from a cop car that caught me bombing this wall right off a main drag (wonderful drunken idea on my part), got tackled by a cop on foot, skinned my knees down to the bone, and called a cop a pig which contributed to a fair degree of brutality on their part and no lenience with the law. I had thrown up on myself in the car ride to the station, and they let me sober up in a cell. I ended up having to pay a $5000 fine and another $500 to a charity of my choice. My mom footed the bill, and that put tremendous strain on our relationship and further provoked me to drink because I was so disappointed with myself.

My parents divorced that summer, and I moved in with my dad because my mom was such a miserable cunt to anything male. The divorce was not pleasant, I saw the ugly sides of my parent's personalities, and that's when I started really drinking to kill emotional pain and murder my memories. My mom and dad used to be my best friends, but when divorce time came they tried to leverage my brother and I against the other parent, so I coped by always being drunk. My weed business supplied me with the money to go boozing, and put me right into the thick of the party. Everyone wanted to go for drinks, everyone wanted me around, and the last place I wanted to be was at my apartment with my dad listening to him tell me how much he hated my mom. I mean, making runs and getting drunk was awesome. It occupied my time, I was popular, but I started finding myself in bars or drinking alone more and more often, just for something to do. My three friends that I used as my support network evaporated from my life; one moved to another city, the other got wrapped up in a boyfriend, and the other went to post-secondary and didn't have the time or inclination to go out drinking and hear me out. I felt very alone, and booze was a good friend.

By that time I was stacking enough paper between selling dope and working part time to move out, and that's when shit went down hill. This was about March 2008. I lived in this house on the opposite side of the town with two girls where virtually all we did was party. Every night, boozing. I was always blue, not knowing why, just ridiculously unhappy. I've always been an introspective person, and kinda suffered from moderate depression, but I had never been that down to that level. I just hated everything, especially myself. I didn't like the person I'd become. I'd abandoned a lot of friends in favour of selling weed and party people, and sacrificed relationships with girls because I didn't have the time. All I had time for was selling and boozing, both of which conveniently went together hand in hand. But I had this deep sense of self-loathing that only seemed to go away when I was wrecked. I blamed others, my friends that I had lost, the girls that I missed, for not understanding or being there for me, which further fuelled my need to get drunk. I didn't realize they weren't there because I was so toxic to be around. 

I eventually had a falling out with the girls that I lived with and moved back in with my mom. When she picked me up she nearly cried, when she had helped me move in I was 185 (I'm 6'3), when she picked me up I was 135. Neither parent had seen me much, maybe 3 or 4 times over the entire course of my 8 month stay in that house, due to the divorce and me being preoccupied with my retail jobs, illicit or otherwise. My mom sensed that something was wrong but knew better than to question me because I was so volatile and irritable if I wasn't stoned or drunk. I attempted to continue selling weed, but my mom caught onto that pretty quickly and served me with the ultimatum of quit or leave, and that would mean leaving a place that was rent free, stocked fridge, and my dogs. I said fuck it, changed my number, and was done with selling dope. I had recently quit my job at the skate shop and got a job as a porter at a new bar that was opening, under an operating company where the staff discount was 50% off food and liquor. The tips were great, I had good hours, and booze was diiiiirt cheap. This was the beginning of the end, around November 2008.

I was forced to move out again in March 2009 due to my mother not being able to take my lifestyle. I was legitimately drunk every day. I was mean, belligerent, and abusive to everyone around me. Virtually the only time I wasn't drunk was at the start of shift at the bar, but by the end I'd be fucking wasted. It cost me nothing. Everyone around me drank. I felt awesome. My three rules were this, if I could afford it, it's not affecting my health, and my relationships weren't failing, it wasn't a problem. I was so deep into denial that I couldn't see I had broken every rule long ago. Working in the bar industry, I predictably got into coke and MDMA. I wouldn't say I was addicted to either substance, but they definitely played their parts in my eventual disintegration. I'd start the night off drinking, take a pill, keep drinking, get blackout drunk, and then rip bangers to keep partying. 

Late that summer, my dad got married to his new girlfriend of a year that I had barely met, and dropped the bomb on me in front of his side of my extended family. I can't remember the month that followed because I got so wasted every night. I felt so wronged by my father, he barely knew this woman (lo and behold she turned out to be a psycho, but that's beside the point), and she treated my brother and I like such shit. I had lost him, and for a time I did, but not because of his relationship with this woman, because I just spent every waking hour I could getting wasted. I was now at the point where I was not speaking to either parent except for occasional small talk when I so happened to see them in public, and felt very abandoned not realizing I was the one pushing myself away from the people I cared about. At about that same time I split with the girl I was seeing because she had cheated on me for, get this, because I spent too much time getting fucked up than I did fucking her, so she went elsewhere. Shitty move on her part fundamentally, but it takes two to tango and that's how it is. I slipped deeper into depression and self-loathing and things got worse. I was hammered in the bar I worked at when she broke the news to me via text message, and I ended up breaking a mirror in the washroom with my fist in a rage. I cut my hand up really badly and got written up and had to replace the mirror, but was not fired miraculously, partially because I was very good at my job and it would be a pain in the ass them hiring someone else.

It was fall 2009 that I moved into a particularly self-destructive environment filled with primarily drug addicts and dealers. I lived there a month, but I was pretty much high on coke and E, drunk, and stoned for that entire time. This is when my coke habit kicked into high gear. I moved out of that house into what will be known as Bad Haus. Around the same time I met a girl known as Big Red, or BR for short. BR was older than I was at the time by 5 years, and I thought ""Score!"". Things were good until my birthday at the start of January. The night previous to my actual birthday, I got really drunk and fucked up with my friends, and the hangover was such that I was half an hour late for dinner with my parents, and BR. This was her first time meeting them. She was livid with me, both for being late but by being so visibly hungover. I had done a shitload of drugs the night previous and had no appetite, instead ordering enough booze to get me drunk by the end of dinner. I worked things out with her, but I could tell she was bothered by my habits, and eventually after about 5 months she dumps me because I cared more about getting wasted than hanging out with her. I cared deeply for her, and it hurt, so I did what I always did and got annihilated. The shine of inebriation had worn off long ago, I used it instead to run from the growing emotional pain I felt, my deepening depression, and my ever-mounting self-loathing.

I make a trip out to the olympics immediately after Big Red and I part ways. I spend 5 days in a drunken stupor, picking fights in seedy East Hastings bars, with people on the street, and miraculously coming out unscathed, but putting my friends in very real danger multiple times. Again, I'm a drunken idiot.

My bosses had noticed my attitude and work ethic steadily declining, and I was threatened with termination if I didn't clean up my act. It cost me a promotion, and planted the seeds of me getting fired from that same job months later. Everything kind of went as usual, getting drunk, but keeping my attitude out of work and remaining employed. I was known as a miserable bastard, and was the pariah of the staff. I went to bed and woke up hating everything. Even when I was drunk I hated everything. I added more and more drugs into the mix, eventually getting up to at least 4 or 5 substance nights, most nights. Anything to kill the hate-speak running through my head. In March 2010, my friend and roommate had a massive heart attack after a night of us partying. I had to bring him to the hospital while I was still fucked up too, and that's when gears long rusted started to turn and I finally started realizing how this was killing me and my friends. My friend survived, but at the cost of always being afraid of dropping dead if he ever exerts himself a lot. I moved back into my mom's house a few weeks after. I didn't really touch drugs after the heart attack incident, but I still drank, and I still hated everything. 

Fast forward to June, when things really start sucking. The bar I'm working at shuts down, and the company moves me to another location they're opening. They dock my pay, my position, and everything I had worked so hard for over the past year and a half. I'm stuck back at the bottom of the totem pole, and I'm bitter, I couldn't understand why. Of course, now I realize that it was because I was such a degenerate drunken drug addled bastard that I was a liability, but in classic denial I blamed others and never questioned myself. Two days before the opening of the new bar, I'm training 2 of the support staff, and I'm pretty drunk. I had been drunk since before arriving to work, crushing a six pack at 10 am to be at work for 12. One of them asks about drinking on shift. I loudly exclaim that as long as they can still do their jobs, I didn't care if they were drunk, high on acid, or stoned stupid. I then use myself as an example, citing that I was drunk right then and could function fine. What I didn't know was that one of the owners of the entire company was around the corner, and promptly fired me. I had now lost damn near everything, but not quite. I use the next month to recover my ego and get really drunk off the severance I got. I neglected to pay my phone bill and rent to my mother, and more or less said fuck it. 

My cousin's wedding is in Seattle, my mother and I fly down. At the wedding dinner, I get blackout drunk and make a damn fool of myself, calling my cousin's new father in law a republican sack of shit, a bigot, and a warmonger, and immediately after storming out with a 12 case of stella to drink by myself in the car. My mom finds me passed out on the hood covered in beer and yelling in my sleep. I wake up with the second worst hangover of my life, and face disapproving stares and whispers from my relatives at breakfast as I not at all discreetly make 5 minute trips to the washroom to heave, which I later learn is audible throughout the entire restaurant. I hear from my mother that my cousin thinks I ruined her wedding, and again I hang my head in shame.

A week after I get back I meet up with my best friend of 10 years. He's a nice guy, my best friend for a reason, but my polar opposite. He's in school, timid, doesn't drink that much and doesn't like to. I always enjoy his company because he listens to me. On this particular night, I walk him home after a rowdy night at the bar. We're close to his house, and he stops me and says he needs to say something. I am of course receptive, he is my best friend. He continues on to tell me that he doesn't want to be friends with me because I have turned into someone he despises. Without another word, he walks off. I haven't talked to him since. Later that night I self-medicate with booze and a bunch of MDMA, but feel that sinking feeling of total self-loathing, disappointment, and sadness. It hurt so much because I knew he was right; I didn't even like myself, I hadn't for a long time.

I apply for and get another bar job, at a rival bar company than the one that previously let me go. Word travels fast in that industry, and my old boss corners me on a night out when I'm wasted and asks me if I want to spy for him, as the new bar I'm employed at is direct competition for their flagship pool hall. I say I'll consider it, and a few days later decline based on the fact that a paycheque isn't worth my reputation. However, I have a very big mouth, especially when drinking, and since I'm always drunk, I always say shit I shouldn't. So, over the course of the next few weeks I tell people the hilarious story of how my old boss wants me to spy on my old boss. This bites me in the ass a week later before the new bar is slated to open and I get fired for allegedly being a spy. I couldn't blame them. I could only blame my big mouth. I proceed to get increasingly drunk as my self-loathing is at an all-time high.

I spend a week getting mangled, and go on yet another trip on the September long weekend to Vancouver for my grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary. At dinner, I get drunk, but not even near as wasted as I was about to get. I knew people in vancouver, and they invited me out. I black out at 9:30, I wake up at 10 the next morning and I have no idea why my family won't look me in the eye, other than suffering from the worst hangover I have ever had. I had apparently broken into the hotel with my friends, stolen furniture, harassed the front desk clerk and threatened to ""maul [her] with my penis"" if she didn't give me an extra room key to replace the one I had presumably lost drinking that night. I find it almost immediately after this exchange, and stagger off with the parting words of ""Fuck you you fat cunt."" This is all relayed to my father via a curt letter slipped under his door. I spend the day dry heaving around the streets of vancouver, being cold shouldered, and feeling like shit.

Fast forward to mid october. I'm selling coke and MDMA because I can't (read: too depressed and self-absorbed in a pool of pity to) get a job, so I'm on the grind. I'm still not really touching drugs as much as booze, maybe with the occasional pill of MDMA. On a whim I go see one of my favorite bands at the urging of a good friend, the one that had moved to a new city years ago to return this year, so I'm like fuck it, why not. There, I am introduced to a girl named we will call Brucie. The night progresses and I get her number, not really thinking anything of it. Later that night I'm cruising facebook and I see that she's added me. She starts chatting with me and before I know it she's in my bed. The next month rules. She becomes the catalyst for me stopping selling drugs, enroll in school, and start questioning myself. I learn that she had recently got out of a two year relationship with an emotionally abusive prick, and tells me that she can't do a relationship. I won't lie, I rolled my eyes at this because this girl was over at my house and in my arms at every waking moment, telling me her secrets, telling me how much she liked me and how strong her feelings were, and making all the right moves. It would have been one thing had it just been casual from the start, but feelings were added to the mix and that's where shit got sticky. All of a sudden, she has a freak out and tells me we need to chill, and more or less stops talking to me for a week. I demand to know what is up, and start going crazy. I had done everything right with this one, I hadn't been drinking that much, I had been making moves to better myself, and I had been positive. I start drinking, hard, to make myself feel better. One saturday, at the end of the night a week and a half ago, I push the subject and demand that we talk things out because I in my infinite wisdom think talking about matters of the heart is a fantastic idea when I'm drunk and fucked on MDMA. I don't remember the conversation. But it was not a therapeutic one. She doesn't really talk to me for the week after. This most recent weekend and the week previous, I am wasted. 110% Mr. Lahey drunk. Saturday I go over to the chill pad and pick a fight with two of our mutual friends who we're all supposed to be drinking with that night. I pick the fight on the basis that they are talking shit about me to Brucie behind my back, and that they should mind their own business. While I kind of had a point, it's not a good idea to fight drunk because one is at their most selfish. I end up making them go home. Brucie drops the rest of us off on the strip and goes home, I ask her why, and she just gives me a look like I'm retarded. I wake up the next day beside myself. I call my one friend and to see what I had done in the blur that was the week previous. I have pushed Brucie away completely, she is no longer interested, and the two friends I picked a fight with refuse to talk to me. This was Sunday. It is now Thursday.

Reddit, I had epiphany, I guess late Tuesday, early Wednesday. Obvious for you, the reader, but I have lost my closest friends, pushed my family away, disappointed everyone, lost 3 girls, 2 jobs in the past year, destroyed my health and my sanity, all for booze. Here is the reason I don't feel AA would be beneficial. I know the underlying causes why I drink. I drink because I am depressed, I'm selfish, and I don't know how to cope with emotional pain. But I'm also pretty intelligent, and I'm not blinding myself anymore. I know I need to stop drinking. I don't have the desire to anymore. I have lost so much that mattered to me that I don't know what to do, but I know now that drinking will only make it worse. I need to get into counseling for depression, and I need to stay away from bad influences. I have been shunned by my friends that I still do have as that one dude they don't want to introduce anyone to because I'll embarrass them. I recognize the cyclical nature of the condition, being I get sad, I drink to make myself feel better, only make things worse, repeat. I need to deal with the root problem that is my self-loathing and depression, and then I'll be fine. I've arranged myself to be barred from most bars in the city to remove temptation, and I will be talking with a counselor soon. I have been brutally honest with you, and myself. Please, advise.

10. Am threatened with termination at work for worsening attitude and self-destructive behavior, friend has heart attack, cured mostly for drugs.

11. Bar I'm working at shuts down, I get fired from the new location for mouthing off wasted in front of higher ups, disappointment with myself reaches all time high.

12. Ruin cousin's wedding by being a drunken asshole. Depression and self-loathing skyrocket, drink to make myself feel better.

The parties at my school are either off-campus house parties or bars, and they are all similar: dark, loud, crowded, etc (the bars are basically entirely for college kids). I'm not that shy normally, but I get shier at parties (probably because I have to yell what I want to say, and that makes me think about what I want to say more). 

And I don't like always talking about drunk stories. I mean, we're getting drunk now: why talk about how much fun you had the last time you were drunk or that hammered girl stumbling around over there THE ENTIRE TIME? My sober conversations are usually much more interesting. (I also think partying is inherently superficial and people are looking for good stories most of the time, but I'm in college so I should adjust.)

Dancing with my good friends is sometimes fun (pretty much the only fun I've had at parties), but it's not better than things we could do sober, and it's often too crowded.

I like the idea of free love in theory, but I don't like the idea of hooking up with someone at a party. I can hardly tell what he looks like because it's dark, and I can't tell anything about his personality or intelligence because it's so hard to have a conversation, so the only connection we have is that we're both intoxicated and human. Given that I'm a small girl, I also have an extreme fear of rape (I've never actually been sexually assaulted, partly because of my paranoia). Thus, I feel uncomfortable when a guy tries to hit on me.

I'm also not a fan of alcohol for a number of reasons...
1) I don't like not having control over my mind and my decisions. I'm a small Asian girl, and I'm afraid of not being able to handle my alcohol and puking, blacking out, or letting someone take advantage of me. I have to think about something complex like Aristotle or the Krebs cycle to maintain mental coherency.
2) Because I feel the need to maintain mental coherency, I spend more time in my head rather than engaging with people than I normally do (but not to the point where I'm making intellectual breakthroughs).
3) I have to pee all the time. How does anyone have a good time when they always have to go?
1&amp;2 are also the reasons I don't like weed, which I would maybe enjoy with a smaller group of trustworthy friends (I've only smoked at parties).

So what do I do? How do I loosen up and actually have a good time?

edit: Thank you all so much. After I came back from the party last night, I watched LOTR with another group of friends, and it was much more fun.

There was no penetration. Thats all i have to say about that event.

Now I am 25, and my older brother is 29 and is happily married. He and his wife are about to reach the stage in their life where they start to have children, and everyone is excited, myself foremost among them. I love the idea of having a niece of nephew to help raise. To me it is an exhilarating though and a very bright prospect in my future, along side with having my own kids one day.

However, a couple of weekends ago my older brother and I were drinking beers and the subject of his and his wife to have kids came up. We spoke about the usual stuff, timing, who will stay home, name, schools, etc. But then he made a transition somehow to the fact i was molested as a child and tried to inquire to me in a subtle manner if i was excited for the ""right"" reasons. I believe i explained myself to my, and hopefully his satisfaction, but still the conversation stuck with me. I believe his wife, whom i get along well with is paranoid about me. She is a very smart person, a doctor, and good hearted but she is very reliant upon studies and articles to make judgments about people.

Now this isn't the first time this has happened, the first time was with my mother about 12 years ago. She was the only other person to know aside from my brother and his wife. Back then she would interrogate me about looking at my brother shower and other miscellaneous traumatizing inquiries. My mom though is sort of a devout bitch so i thought it would be my last incursion with any sort of accusations or suspicions.

I thought being molested would only effect me if i let it, but instead i am encountering ramifications from it just by the virtue of being a victim?

What do i do? Do i take on the suspicions of my brother head on? If i do i am paranoid of sounding like im protesting too much. Do i do nothing? But then what if i get cut off from my potential nieces and nephews.

Long story short, I tried to provide evidence that the issues were not my fault, but the office manager refused to acknowledge them, then immediately terminated me without warning. 

On the job I was repeatedly harassed for being 'too quiet' being asked such things as ""Do you ever f#$^ing talk?"". Once they discovered I was an atheist, I was repeatedly told of 'the Light of God' and other such things. They would constantly talk about strippers, their sex life, feminine hygiene products -- things I didn't feel were right to talk about. The words ""C%$tface"" *dirty sl#t"", ""sugart#$s"" were thrown around often, and made me very uncomfortable. When I made mention, I was told it was ""their sense of humor"" and to just ignore it and work. 

They also would lure me into other menial jobs (helping in warehouse, running errands) so they could go through my computer while I was gone. They would take records of Skype conversations I had with an out-of-company tech who I would go to for advice on occasion and claim I was trying to 'sabotage the website'. No one in this office was very technical, and did not understand when I tried to show them how to use the control panels. 

Anyway, during the meeting this morning, the office manager asked me ""What kind of sick excuse for a human are you?"" ""Do you have any moral code at all?"" with more expletives, of course. I plead my case, offered evidence, but was terminated without being able to show it to them.

1295629624.0,35,self.needadvice,f6kfe,wife left me and secretly left the country today with my three boys against my will. what to do now?,38,3,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/f6kfe/wife_left_me_and_secretly_left_the_country_today/,"my wife and 3 sons and I are all US citizens. we left the US 18 months ago for me to take a job teaching English in a foreign country. we love this country and everything about it, but living in an old, small 2 bedroom apartment has been difficult for our marriage and our family. we planned on staying here for several more years, but had hopes of finding a better job and improving our living situation. the boys are coming along with the language great, and there is something magical about their continued innocence and naïvety in not coming into contact with the complexities of the world because of the language barrier that still exists, and because we are out of the states.

i'm not perfect by any stretch but I am willing to admit my shortcomings, own up to them, work on improving myself and overcoming my weaknesses and I have been doing so and making steady and big progress on things in my life. i have also never cheated on her, or abused her or my kids.

I believe that due to childhood sexual abuse (grandpa), and due to an emotionally absent father during her childhood (also molested by his dad) she has a very difficult time not being angry at me just for playing the role of significant male in her life. she doesn't seem to have the emotional capacity to forgive and move on and not harbor a grudge. she also has difficulty distinguishing and differentiating the anger she feels and that I deserve when I do something stupid, with the anger that I don't deserve but that is still present inside of her from other issues. after 9 years, her shitlist against me is pretty long.

all 3 of her sisters (also abused) have been divorced (one of them is on her 3rd marriage), and any time we have any issues, her family encourages her to ""be strong"" and stand up for herself and leave me, with the underlying implication being that by staying with me she is weak. i have read emails and text messages that they have sent, and are extremely negative to her about me and about our relationship.

after we came to this country, her parents and one of her sisters who has been my biggest detractor moved to the state where we used to live and where we went to university. neither of her parents have a real job to speak of, and they live with my mother-in-law's father (not the abuser) in a small house. my wife's sister doesn't have a job either. she got pregnant with an unknown dude's kid while on a romp in europe, after declaring that she was a lesbian and leaving her own husband to more fully commit to being a lesbian. she is divorced now, raising the kid on her own, shacked up with another single mom she met at group therapy (i doubt she is paying rent), and supporting herself on financial aid she receives as a student and foodstamps she receives from the state. my wife went to visit last summer and laughed how her sister was buying groceries for everyone in the family with her foodstamps.

wife took the boys and left me to live with friends a couple hours away from our apartment after we got into a fight on new year's eve when I asked her if she could please be nice to me and stop being angry at me.

she came home two weeks ago to tell me that she had decided to leave the country with the boys because she couldn't stand being with me, and there is no help for her or us to deal with the issues we have here. in the end I agreed and supported her in her desire to go to the states, and even asked my mom to help us out financially with the plane tickets.

my mom absolutely adores our boys. she has come to visit us here twice. is constantly calling to talk to each of the boys, sending them letters and postcards, buying and sending them small gifts, and begging us to get the boys on skype video conference at every opportunity. she cherishes her relationship with the kids.

my dad is a little standoffish with our family because my wife suspects that he molested me as a child, and also believes that if she leaves him alone with our kids he will molest them also. i don't share in the belief that my dad molested me, nor do I have any recollection of or memory of him abusing me and he has been one of my heroes my entire life.

my wife has always felt neglected by her parents as an adult. she had to drop out of college her sophomore year because she couldn't afford to eat, and her mom came to buy her hundreds of dollars worth of herbal supplements (the non-conventional emotional healing technique of the month) but wouldn't buy her groceries, or give her money to help her pay rent. her parents also didn't care enough to tell her she could apply for and receive financial assistance or student loans. after we got married, she rarely if ever spoke with her parents on the phone or via email. weeks and months would go by. their relationship with our boys was even more distant and communication less frequent.

after coming here my wife started a blog that she put hours and hours into maintaining, but her parents never once mentioned even having looked at it or read it. i had to call them to tell them my wife was really hurt by their negligence of her, and how they never call or express interest in her or the boys. her mom has always been keen to help as many people as she can, and give unlicensed (and no college degree) relationship counseling and therapy, but she never seems to have time or motivation to want to help my wife. bawling, my wife got on the phone to voice to them the hurt she felt from their neglect before they finally started making a random comment here and there on her blog, and a computerized birthday card for the boys, not even hand-signed. This was less than a year ago.

So the wife wants to go back to the states, and she has decided she wants to go live with her parents in the state where we went to school, even though she is the one that raised the point earlier that she was glad we came to this foreign country because had we stayed in that state after her parents and sister moved there, we would be long divorced.

i told her that i really want our marriage to work, and i understand that she needs to get some space from me, and get some help, but that if she wants to take the boys with her, I can't support her in going to live anywhere near her sister and her parents. they tell her that us moving to japan, and me trying to ""isolate"" her from them is an indicator that I abusive of her. i can't imagine the nasty and damaging things that would be mentioned in front of my boys about me and about our marriage. plus, I believe that there will not be any encouragement to heal herself by working out her relationship with me instead of running away from it. they want her to be ""strong"" by leaving me.

she suggested that she could take the kids and live with my parents, both of whom have decent paying jobs, live in their own 6 bedroom home where I grew up, and in the town where my wife went to high school, on the other side of the country from her parents and that one sister. she told me she would be willing to go and live there. it was her idea to begin with.

i had a difficult time with the idea of her leaving me at all and ending our plans here in this country permanently and taking the boys away from me at all, but I finally wrapped my head around this and agreed to let her go and I decided to have faith in her intentions. i even asked my mom to front us the $4000 we needed for plane tickets to get them all there which she did a few days ago. flight scheduled to leave next thursday.

my wife was to bring our boys back to our town here in the foreign country for the boys to attend their last day of pre-school today (friday morning) to say goodbye to their friends and to go to a farewell party the school was throwing for them. she was to drop them off there at 10AM this morning, and then I would have the boys tonight, all day tomorrow and then bring them back to her on Sunday for church together.

she won't answer the phone if I call her, so i texted her at 10:45am to make sure the boys had made it to school. no response. texted again every 10 mins or so until I finally decided to drive to their school (language barrier makes it difficult to call) and see if they were there a little before noon. They weren't there. Called her, no answer. Phone did ring a lot of times, so I know that it was on and she was just not answering. Went to get money out of the ATM to pay our rent and some bills shortly thereafter (today was my once a month payday), and she apparently had cleaned the account out almost completely (hit the maximum daily withdrawal limit which is quite high in this country). Called and found out that she had checked out of the hotel she had been staying at in the town a couple hours away where we go to church.

I found out tonight at 7PM that she took a train to the airport with her friend this morning (10 hour drive, or 3 hour high speed train ride), changed her plane tickets that my mom bought, and got on a plane back to the US one week early. My contract doesn't end here for 6 months. She didn't even let me say goodbye to my boys, or give me my last weekend with them after not having seen them hardly at all for the last 3 weeks since she left our home.

She's in the air right now still, and I don't know if she is planning on honoring her commitment to go and live with my parents, or if she is (and has been planning) to hit the ground in the states and immediately make a run to her parents, since I have no ability to do anything about it.

Before any of this happened today, I decided that if I want my marriage to work, I should be back in the states with my wife as well. I should find a place to live in my parents' town to still give her space, but to also be able to see my boys and to go to therapy together with my wife and get our marriage back on solid ground before coming back to this foreign country again to fulfill my contract. I asked my work if I could take a ""mental health"" leave of absence for a few weeks and they said yes. My contract says I can take up to 60 days of consecutive sick leave if I need it. So I asked my mom if she would buy me a ticket and she supported the idea and did it on the condition that I would find somewhere else to stay, and that I would not bring any contention into their home. Everyone I have talked to has agreed that if I want the marriage to work, I should be there and willing to go to therapy together with her, so that's what I was planning on doing.

Her leaving today kind of threw a wrench in the works. It may or may not have been spurred yesterday by me hacking her secret email and facebook account to confirm my suspicions about her intentions to not actually stay with my folks, and to see what was being said about me behind my back (pretty nasty stuff by both her and her family).

She has not called my parents to tell them she changed her flight, and she does have a layover coming up in a few hours in the states where she will have an opportunity to call and let them know that she needs to be picked up at the airport. If she doesn't call it will be a good indication of her intention to not go to live with them. With the money she drained from our account here, she could very easily buy a new ticket from her layover destination to her parents' state.

So that's where we're at. If she does go to live with my folks like we agreed, my intention is to still use the ticket I have for this coming Thursday and be there with her and the boys to work on things as a family. If she does not go to live with my family, I am very confident that her family will work very hard to not allow me to see my kids, and they will be pushing her very hard to serve me divorce papers and take full custody of the kids in the process.

He's like 85 and has liver cancer and doesn't move around too well or anything. The past 5 years I have been doing things for him. I mow his lawn, take his garbage out to the curb, and shovel his sidewalks in the winter, typical neighborly stuff. Anyway, he asked me to hang out today and help his church volunteers know what to do. These are just teens, and they have their youth minister with them, but seriously, They've been here since 8 AM and it's noon. He's ordered pizza for them, made them several pitchers of lemonade, they've eaten his cookies, all his chips and snacks, etc and so have sat around and complained about it being too hot to work. Meanwhile I've been pulling the weeds and trimming the bushes while they have been littering, stepping on his flowers, and laying out in the yard to get a tan. Should I say anything to them or just let it go as it is free ""help?"" 

I think the biggest problem is actually their youth minister, to be honest, he keeps telling them to take breaks and undermining any directions I give them like ""that's not a weed, don't step on it"" then he goes ""oh but it's in the way so it's fine."" Fuck that guy, I want to go to his house and trample his flower beds. Anyway, anyone got any suggestions for what to do? Do I just let it go? They're supposed to be here until 5, or the job is done.

Edit: So what I've decided to do was a bit of a hybrid of the advice given. I've stopped helping out and let the church know. The minster said he'd call the youth minister and talk to him. The minster also said they would find money in the church budget to replace any plants that are damaged because of the volunteers.

1370726879.0,33,self.needadvice,1fy35j,My mom has a cleaning problem,35,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1fy35j/my_mom_has_a_cleaning_problem/,"Hi everyone,

So here's some background. About 20 years ago, just after my parents were married, my dad caught Hepatitis B. The illness came and went, but he was a carrier of the virus for a number of years. It was no big deal, but my mom read up on the disease and spoke with doctors, and she gradually become more and more paranoid. 

I'm 18 and my sister is almost 16, and as young kids, things were fine for the most part. We'd just be cautious and avoid eating/drinking from his plate/glass, be very careful if he accidentally cut himself, etc. As the years passed, my mom just got more and more obsessive about cleaning. 

If we rode in his car, sat on the same couch, or even gave him a hug, we'd have to change our clothes. If he kissed one of us on the head, we'd have to wash our hair. We'd have to avoid sitting on the same chair in the living room or at the kitchen table. She tries to keep ""our"" food away from ""his"" food in the refrigerator or on the counters. We can't sit on the steps outside of our door or the deck in the backyard. If my dad leaves in the morning before she wakes up, she'll clean the handles on her car door in the morning before leaving if for some reason he may have touched them. It's gotten to the point where we just stay in our rooms where it's ""clean"" so that we don't have to deal with any trouble or stress her out by giving her more work. 

If we leave the house for a while, when we return she'll wash the doorknobs, sinks, light switches, counters, and basically anything else that he might have touched. 

My dad found out a few years ago from his doctor that he's not even a carrier anymore, and I expected her to lay off the cleaning finally, but nothing has changed. He's always known my mom to be very paranoid about it, but he doesn't know the extent to which she goes. If he sees her cleaning he just assumes she's trying to keep the house clean. It's not even real cleaning to be honest. Our house is a bit messy (who's isn't?), but clutter will not bother her. She obsesses over this imaginary sense of ""dirt"" that my dad leaves behind on everything he touches. 

Now my mom is a very intelligent woman. She graduated with her master's degree from one of the best universities in the US. She understands how things work so it's clearly a problem. I'm almost certain it's OCD. 

Aside from this, our family gets along just fine. Everyone talks to one another, we get along fine, and have a pretty healthy relationship in general.

As a kid, this was just normal to me. Now that I'm older, I've started thinking about everything, and stopped accepting it as the norm. Because it's not. I can understand still being cautious about sharing food/drinks and being careful with blood, but the rest is just not normal. I worry very much for my mom's health. In 20-30 year's time, when she gets older, she's not going to be able to run around the house cleaning after him. Regardless, it's no way to live. Her stress levels are through the roof sometimes and it's slowly wearing her down. I obviously love and care for her very much, and I've told her it's a problem, but there's no way she'll ever get any help for it. It's just how she is, and I want her to be better, to relax, and to enjoy life without the constant worries.

I just don't know what to do to help her realize that it's an issue. Recently, I've been talking back a bit, telling her how absurd she's being, and telling her that she has a problem. Not in an aggressive way, but in a way that's different from how I used to simply just obey her when she told me to wash my hands if I touched something ""dirty"". But she doesn't take me seriously. 

If anyone made it this far, thanks for listening to my rant. Even if you don't have any advice, I appreciate you taking the time to hear my concern.

He was unplanned and unwanted, but I had him anyway. I have no good examples to look to, I have no patience, and I am afraid I am damaging my son in the way I treat him. I try really hard to be a good mom but I feel like I am just pretending, like I am just imitating what I think a mom is supposed to act like. I am an extreme introvert and I feel like my son rapes my attention all day every day and I resent him for it. I do hit him sometimes. I put him in his room often. I am ashamed at the way I am and I do love my son and do want whats best for him and I am coming to realize that may not be with me.

I don't have reliable family to offer me an occasional break or anything so I am literally alone with this little demon 24/7. He is anxious, demanding, he hits, he is very hyper, etc and I know these behaviors stem from a need for more attention. I am simply not a warm loving person and I know my son craves these things. 

My question is this: if I were to put him up for adoption at this age, would the abandonment be more damaging to him or would growing up with me be worse? He is at an age where I think he would realize what is happening if I put him up for adoption, and realize that mommy is leaving him. Would that type of abandonment be more damaging than having a stressed miserable impatient mother for the rest of his life? Or would the temporary distress be worthwhile if he gets a loving family for the rest of his childhood?

I have kicked this idea around since the first week of his life. I have tried his whole life and I feel like I am failing. 

EDIT: For clarity, I am married but my husband isn't around often (work) and his upbringing was much like mine so he is similarly ill-equipped. Both of his parents are dead and I only have my mother but she is a drug addict, so he and I are on our own in every way.


EDIT#2: I just wanted to say that I am in awe of the compassion Reddit has shown me. These answers have shown me that adoption is the last last last option and it would be in the best interests of me and my son to try counseling, daycare, talking to the husband, etc before considering the permanence of adoption.

1285996326.0,29,self.needadvice,dlsz5,Someone cut themselves and called the police and said I did it and I was arrested and now I am living a nightmare!  I need advice.,33,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/dlsz5/someone_cut_themselves_and_called_the_police_and/,"I just moved into a new area of the state a little over three weeks ago and my landlord refused to repair and hookup the stove, and the only heater in the unit amongst various other things. The bedroom door is off the frame, there are light fixtures and bathroom accessories that are still sitting in the closet waiting to be installed. When I moved in, the smoke detector was at least 10 years old and the battery was rusted in it. Needless to say, it didn’t work. 

When I expressed these concerns in an email to my landlord, she was at my unit within one hours of receiving the email with a three day eviction notice. After repeated emails begging her to just make the repairs she began harassing me in email. She said she waited to talk things out but I didn't wish to suffer her verbal abuse and asked that all communication be written from there on out.  Since then, I have had threatening emails from her and her friend stating that they were going to get me fired, her and her son verbally attacked me and refused to leave my apartment until I was out (police were notified on this account), my tire was punctured and flatted by a blunt object to the sidewall (police report on file) and false accusations that resulted in me being arrested, a restraining order placed upon me, and now the locks to the unit are glued shut so that I cannot enter the unit. 

She also placed a two day notice to enter unit on my door so that she can now go in and make repairs. But what is the point now? At my arraignment I was instructed by the public defender not to say anything but ""not guilty."" 
I was instructed by the court not to go back to the unit and not to call my landlord. She and one of her friends have sent multiple emails to my work email address threatening to get me fired by sending multiple background checks of other people with same name to my employer. 

They made it very clear in emails that they wanted me out of the unit, and they wanted me fired and now, as a result of the arrest, I am on unpaid administrative leave, and I am homeless and staying with a friend. My son is living with my mother in another part of the state because I am unable to leave the county.  I cannot even get into the unit to get my clothes. 

Last week before the charge against me I tried to file harassment charges with the police but they said the malicious behavior is civil and immoral but not criminal. I cannot prove that they punctured my tire, and them attempting to get me fired is a civil matter. 

After that, I contacted a landlord tenant coordinator but they just tell you your rights and don't help to enforce them. She informed me that the landlord cannot throw me out without going to court. She said to send her notice that the eviction she sent was not a legal eviction notice and she did not have the authority to make me move within three days. I did that and received more harassing emails and things only got worse.

After my tire was punctured I sent my son on a train to stay at my moms until this blew over.  I sensed danger and did not want him around if something happened.  Things started to die down when I heard nothing for a few days so I sent for my son to come home.

I was awaiting a legal eviction so that I could tell all this to a judge and possibly have her return my deposit so that I could rent another place. My son was only home from one night when on Sunday evening at 9:40PM two women I have never seen before knocked on my door and served me with a 20-day eviction notice. I said thank you and shut the door. Seconds later my son, his friend, and I heard someone yell something about a knife, and then something hit the wall. We ran outside to see what was going on and the parking lot was empty. Puzzled, we went back inside the unit and the friend’s grandmother picked him up. 

A few minutes later, my son and I were getting ready for bed and there was another knock at the door. My son answered the door and a bright light was shining inside and it was the police. They asked for me and asked me to step outside. They then put me in handcuffs and said I was being arrested for first degree assault with a deadly weapon. I dropped to the ground in shock and began to cry. I couldn’t believe what was happening. They put me in the back of a police car and began asking questions. They asked me if I had a knife in the house and I said yes. They asked me if two women had served me an eviction notice and I said yes, then they asked me what happened next. I said that I said thank you and shut the door. Apparently that was unbelievable that anyone would say such a thing. They then told me the story that the two women had told. They put me in the back of the police car. When I was in the back of the car I was still crying and quite upset at this point I said to the office “how can you arrest someone for something just because someone said they did it?.” He turned around and yelled at me and said that the victim has two fresh wounds and they found a knife in my house that matched the victim’s description, silver blade, black handle, and that was probable cause to arrest me. 

They took my 17 y/o son into custody and then to a local foster home because I have no family or friends within two hours driving distance. I spent three days in jail before being bailed out yesterday. I live in a city that is in the top ten for gang violence and violent crimes. When I was in jail they put me in solitary confinement for 24 hours then into the the counties most violent shark tank.  
Now the locks are glued shut on the unit and I may actually be terminated from my job. 

I am a social worker and I am responsible for 317 employees in 15 counties. I have no crimes against people in my background, just a couple minor traffic violations. I have worked for my employer for 7 years and I have many co-workers, family and friends who are in shock that anything like this could happen. I have many character witnesses who have an excellent standing in the community. 

Here is where the problem is compounded. I had cancer about five years ago and at that time I was working for my current employer part-time and a college part-time. Because I was part time I had no medical insurance and ran up some rather large medical bills. Because of that I don’t have great credit and $800 a month is coming out of my checks to pay them off. I did not have the financial resources to move right away, and my son and I were forced to live in inhabitable conditions as a result. 

The landlords son who happens to be her maintenance man that aided in the harassment has an extensive violent criminal history as well as drug charges, the latest charge being first degree assault and was convicted in April 2010. The landlord has multiple court cases and a restraining order against someone else that is still currently in effect. 

Because I was going to be moving again shortly, I did not move all of my things into the unit. My son and I just had two forks, two spoons and one knife. The knife they found was small and silver with a black handle.  Who doesn't have one of those in their home!?! The knife the police took was in my craft area by the front door because I cut wood to make a frame for my artwork the night before. There should be fresh wood flakes inside the knife blade and no blood or dna. Not only that, but who cuts someone and sits the knife on a craft table awaiting police to come and find it?

I am still in shock and find myself in a position where I am unsure how to get the help I need due to my financial issues. I have saved multiple emails back and forth where sthe landlord refused to make repairs, and where she and another person repeatedly harass me daily and threaten to get me fired. 

My son and I can pass a polygraph with flying colors and I am absolutely positive that the two women who are accusing me of assault, the landlord, and her son will refuse to take a polygraph. 

I apologize for the grammar and the panic stricken email but I have been very ill at the thought of losing my life over a lie and a cruel landlord. I have been ill and unable to eat for the past four days. Everything that I eat comes back up. The guards forced me to see a doctor when I was incarcerated and they had to give me two separate shots of anti-nausea medication as well as an anti anxiety medication. I can’t eat or sleep and I feel like I have done everything I can and still there is no hope.  I have recently learned that there are two superficial scratches on the alleged victims shoulder. During my incarceration I had my head slammed into a wall, the floor and woke up with a foot in my diaphragm because I would not go and retrieve my meal and give it to my attacker.

This has been the worst week of my life.... On Thursday my bestfriend (and roommate) since elementary school got into a huge fight, then yesterday (saturday) my girlfriend and I got into a huge fight and we broke up, then this morning (sunday) my mom called me and told me my beloved Nana had passed away after a short battle with lung cancer. And now to top it off I have to decide if I am going to attend the wake/funeral. 

I am attending college in GA and my family lives in IL and the wake/funeral will most likely be Tues/Wed or Wed/Thurs. Besides the fact that it is very far away very soon, if i go i will most likely miss 2 tests and 2 labs and maybe some other work and finals are in 2 weeks. And i really want to go because I had been meaning to call her for the last three weeks but i had kept putting it off, so ive been regretting not calling her and talking to her one last time.

So I guess what I'm asking is: Am I going to regret it for the rest of my life if I don't go? (money does not play a role, dad has plenty of FFmiles.)





EDIT: Thanks for the all the advice. I ended up not going because I wouldn't be able to make up 3 labs and the classes that I have the tests in both have the policy of dropping the lowest test out of 4 and if you miss one thats the drop. I talked to my parents and they both agreed that if she were still here she would tell me not to worry about it and focus on my school work. So I ended up writing a letter of the things I wanted Nana to know and put it in with a deck of cards (she loved to play card games) and overnighting it home, and my parents told me they would make sure that they would place it with her before they close the casket.

EDIT 2: Roommate and I talked things out and hugged it out. All good on that front. GF on the other hand.... but hey on the bright-side its almost summer and I can go home and party and have fun with my friends instead of having to worry about talking to her every minute (she lives in GA where we go to school, I live in IL)

At 22 I had my son. My relationship with their father was tittering on the edge of a complete fallout and I was  essentially homeless. Thank the stars for my drunken mother taking us in. After I gave birth to my son in December 2010 I cried. I did nothing but cry and sleep when I could, leaving my daughter in her crib all day to watch the TV. Two months after he was born I became zombified. Every day I was just on auto-pilot, doing what had to be done and nothing more. Their father finally found a job  and we all moved in together in February 2011. 

I no longer  read stories to my daughter, where I'd used  to do it every night. I no longer played with her, colored pictures, sang songs, or any of that stuff I had loved to do. When my son wasn't nursing he was in his bassinet. When he was too big for that he was in his bouncy chair. When he was too big for that, in his crib. I'm still amazed that he learned to walk at nine months because he was hardly on the floor at all.

I was extremely apathetic. I didn't care what happened. I fed them, clothed them, bathed them and kept the house clean. But I put forth no effort to do anything else. Eventually it became worse and I stopped cleaning the house and showering as often. I was no longer a happy, cheerful mother doing all of my housewife duties with a happy heart.  I stopped cooking amazing meals and keeping the house pretty. I stopped caring about bills. I stopped caring about putting healthy food into my kids. 

My son is now two years old. He has a horrible attitude that is very hard to deal with. My daughter is five and sweet as honey, but very easily has her feelings hurt and I hurt them more than I care to admit.
 I realize I'm becoming the mother that my mom was. I send them to their room for 3/4ths of the day so I can sit here and wallow in my own guilt and sadness. I take the time out of my day to talk to them and end up feeling depressed over it later. 

I just don't know how to even begin to turn it around. I'm  a stay at home mother. My husband works a lot and we have one vehicle. I hardly leave. I don't have any friends or family that I can spend time with or even talk to. I don't have any resources that I'm aware of to get professional help for me. I want to be that amazing mother again. I really, really do.

EDIT: I feel I should add that my kids are not as bad as the kids discussed in that askreddit thread. I have at least held my ground as the authority figure in the house. I'm slowly losing my grip on it now, but  it's there. And they are well mannered. My daughter always has been, and thankfully she has taught some of that to my son. They mostly behave in  public. It's just  slowly but  surely leading to my children becoming one of those children and I don't want that for them. I want them to be happy and well adjusted.",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_18ozm5,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/18ozm5/i_am_not_a_good_mother_i_need_and_very_badly_want/,
1354725231.0,28,self.needadvice,14btvr,I've been lying to my parents for the past 2 years about going to school.  What should I do?,38,10,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/14btvr/ive_been_lying_to_my_parents_for_the_past_2_years/,"It's more complicated than what I just posted.  My life's complicated.  

I'll start from the beginning.  I graduated high school, got into a decent college, went for a year.  I didn't do so well (no motivation), failed/withdrew from a ton of classes.  So my parents and I decide that school is not right for me, and I come home to take community college courses.  
I tried every new semester to go, but after a period of about 2 weeks, I'd just start skipping, making excuses to my teachers, etc.  Eventually I'd end up not going altogether, and 'faked' my grades to my parents. 

Well, it's almost the end of the second 'year', and I decided for my last quarter I'd take the money for the college and purchase a kick-ass gaming computer (something I've always wanted).  Bad idea, I know.  

Ends up being my parents find out I spent 1,400 dollars on my bank account and I've concocted a lie about how I sold pot over the summer.  Yeah, good idea again.  

Now they want to see my bank account and other stuff to prove all this, and that I'd paid for the coming semester (more details but the gist of it).  

I'm going to have to come clean and state I have not been going to class for the past 2 years. They'll probably kick me out.  I may have a friend I can stay with for the time being, but I don't know where the hell, what the hell I'm going to do.  I'm also a volunteer firefighter (great, I know, a lying firefighter, issues there too), and would LOVE to be able to continue with my company, but I have to be within 5 miles of my towns border, and I'm certainly not going to be able to afford to live in my town (think McMansions, top 1%, CEO's, Celebrities.  Yeah, that lovely place).  I also have barely any work experience, other than a paid internship at my fathers company (as in the company he works at, not 'his'), and lifeguarding.  I don't know how I'm going to get money to pay for rent in an apartment.  

I have issues on top of all this.  I don't mind 'lying' per say.  I wish I could avoid it, but if it gets me an easier path, I'd do it (other than at the firehouse.  One place I do not tolerate it at all).  I have some sort of autism (aspergers), which somewhat explains my non-motivation.  I just don't think college is for me.  

So I've been seriously considering joining the military.  Marines, Army, whichever is better for me. I thrive under discipline.  Under orders.  I need somewhere to go.

Anyways any advice for a bonehead like me?  I'm scarred. 

EDIT: I'm 20 years old and a male if that changes/helps anything

EDIT 2:  I'd like to clarify after reading the responses.  I wasn't clear in stating what i meant by aspergers.  I've been diagnosed with it.  But I'm not saying it's BECAUSE of aspergers i'm lying, unmotivated, etc.  It's contributed some, being alienated from everyone, having next to no friends, no relationships etc.  But I do know there's something else wrong with me.  I was very elaborate with my lies keeping this a secret, making fake schedules, grades, hiding in cars while I was 'in class'.  
I've told my mother, not my dad yet (he has no empathy for pysiciatric problems).  I'm probably not going to be kicked out, and going to get help with my huge problem.  I've just always had issues with motivation.  I don't care about things other than firefighting, video games, and my family (not enough to not lie).

I am behind up to six months on some of my credit cards. I get calls non stop from debt collectors. 

This was me three years ago. 

Since then I have learned, I have learned a lot and I learned it the hard way. I am no longer living beyond my means. I am no longer living off a credit card, they are cut and burned up. I ditched every single utility except for electric (water is free in my apartment) and my phone. I ate almost nothing, what I did eat included hot dogs, pizza and pasta. I got a second job at Sears auto center, I changed tires and did oil changes. Doing this for 80 hours a month put an extra $200 in my pocket, yeah it sucked (but I did learn how to balance tires which is new to me). I worked really hard at my day job and got a really crappy raise. I went out and found a better paying day job and quit both of my other jobs. I made deals with debt collectors to pay off some of my credit card debts for less. I also paid some debt collectors the full amount to try and salvage my credit, I don't think it helps, my credit is still abysmal. I got caught up on the rest of credit cards I still owe on. I paid some of them off. I paid my car off.

As of July 2010 I am in $60k in debt. $40k ish is student loans. (yeah $20k in credit cards is stupid, I was young dumb and in love... As a bonus the credit cards that are left have a 3%, 2.75% and 0% APRs) This is a huge milestone for me, half way there and have been on time with every payment for almost three years. And I am now at a point where I can save money. I feel rich because this is the first time in my almost 30 years of live that I have a bank account with a average balance above $1,000.00. I still try to live as frugally as possible, but I keep a pretty good diet now. 

Hang in there debtors. Get a second job, even if it sucks like mine did. I was pretty depressed, so distraction that it provided me was worth more than the income. Cut everything. If you think you can't cut it, you probably can. Sell everything that is worth any money. I sold my TV solely so I would get less calls from debt collectors.

I have to say that 90% of my friends never contact me first or invite me anywhere. They'll text me, but only if I text first, and I always have to be the one to keep the conversation going. If we do already happen to meet up somewhere, it's all laughs, smiles, conversation, and fun (actual fun, really! nothing awkward, they're not pitying me, etc). However, after that when we're no longer in the same place, I NEVER hear from anyone. They'll make plans with others and not include me, yet they do include my own roommate, people they've met through me, people they've met at the same time as me, etc. 

Now, I really don't know what to do because I've tried many different ""tactics"" and none seem to work:

1) when I was younger and more ""upset"" about the issue (read: immature) I used to call people out about it. My best friend of seven years went off to college and completely dropped me from all communication; when I told him how I felt about it, he said, ""Sorry. Yeah I do that sometimes. I'm sorry."" and then just kept doing it. Now, there's no grudge between us or anything, but he still does it. I NEVER hear from him, even when I try to ask about his accomplishments, what he's up to, or just bring up old inside jokes.

2) then, I started to bring it up delicately. I'd say to someone, ""Hey, I saw you and [my roommate] and others went to [restaurant] yesterday. I love that place, I'd love to go next time!"" They'd say stuff like, ""Oh yeah, it was completely last minute. I'll tell you next time."" Then, they'd continue to go and do things like that over the ensuing weeks and would never once tell me.

3) Lastly, I've just started ""moving on"" from people completely, so if they treat me like the above enough times, I just won't try anymore. I won't be impolite, but I just won't say anything or act like I notice or care. I figured, if they're really my friends, they'll contact me sooner or later. Wrong. The reverse has happened. The people I've tried this with drifted away faster than ever, and I haven't heard from them in years.


So, what does one do in this situation!? Talking about it hasn't worked and ignoring it hasn't worked. Obviously you might say to get new friends, but because 90% of my friends do this, I can't really drop them all at once. Plus, when we DO happen to be talking or hanging out, we enjoy each other and they really are my friends. You might also say for ME to invite them somewhere, but as they rarely contact me and barely keep up a text conversation unless I pull their weight, I don't feel comfortable doing this just yet.

Any advice? :/ THANK YOU.

1356376800.0,29,self.needadvice,15dweb,Younger brother in 7th grade doing drugs for almost 2 years and parents don't give a shit,43,14,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/15dweb/younger_brother_in_7th_grade_doing_drugs_for/,"This is somewhat relevant to know first, but we're Asian. The parents are from Taiwan, but they've been living in the states for almost 30 years and can speak English. Problem is, they have no idea how to understand modern day concepts and they're shitty ass parents. Completely ignorant and play up to the stereotype that the youngest child gets EVERYTHING they want (brother). 


My brother just turned 13 about 2 weeks ago. He's been a trouble child ever since he got an xbox in 4th grade (I know, ridiculous). For miscellaneous things, he got expelled from his elementary school in 5th grade, expelled at BOTH middle schools in our city, and as a result, has been expelled from the school district in the city we live in (small city). To top it off, he's also a spoiled brat and the parents pretty much give him everything he asks for. 

Examples:

* Got a laptop (at least $1k), phone, and an itouch a good year before I even got a phone. I currently use those old-flippy-number-pad phones and my friend gifted his old ipod to me. 

* We have never owned a game console before, so around the time the wii and xbox360 came out, we decided as a family to get a wii, but bought the 360 instead because he went insane in costco. 
* Asked for the kinect when it came out, only used it twice before he started asking for an itouch
* THREW A TANTRUM FOR THE ITOUCH A WEEK AFTER GETTING THE KINECT (???)
* oh man, this list could go on forever, so I'll stop here

He has no understanding of where money comes from. Because my mom has a steady job at her company, he asks for money all the time, she gives him more, and he somehow sells stuff  (THAT HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO) on craigslist to make a shitton of money too.  

His grades are rock bottom and he can barely spell, let alone write properly. There was a point in time where he did NOT attend school for about 6 months (Sept '11 - Feb '12). 

Not to mention, he's completely disrespectful to those who have authority over him and talks back all the time. I kid you not, **HE IS A COMPULSIVE LIAR.** He will lie straight to your face on instinct, and on the rare occasion he doesn't, he comes up with some equally BS answer. Worst of all, parents also let him do whatever the hell he wants. Go out at anytime, doesn't control when he comes home, where he goes, or what he does.

**In short, he's your grade-F juvenile delinquent. **

Earlier in January, he misused mom's phone and basically racked up over $700 in phone charges for texting (never had the plan in the first place), buying facebook credits for apps (at least $300 here), and using up data my mom never had in the first place for watching youtube videos and using fb. *Punishment?* Mom asked him to not do it again, but let him keep the phone. You can guess that he didn't learn. 

My older sister, who is currently working, was back to visit around that time and knew the whole situation. She told me she had noticed that he was waking up in the late afternoons, really groggy and with really red eyes, as opposed to when he was younger, he used to be proud that he could wake up at 7am before everyone else without an alarm. 

**Trust me, this is the really short version without details.** Sister was looking through the phone texts during dinner and saw one of the chats was talking about ""smoking"" ""puffs"" and other words I can't remember, but basically **pot, weed, marijuana, WHATEVER.**  This was during a dinner outing (I wasn't there), but they asked him, he denied, sister said ""Ok, then we'll do a drug test on you when we go home,"" yknow from CVS pharmacies,  and when they were going to the car, he ran away. Eventually found him and got home at 2am. 

The next morning, mom tried to interrogate him, but she obviously had no idea what he was doing. She kept asking if he's done drugs and he kept yelling ""I ONLY TRIED IT ONCE!!!"" My sister and I knew better, but our mom just stupidly believed it. After this event, parents continued to let him go out and do whatever he wants, whenever. 

A couple weeks after that, I found remains of weed in his room. There were 2 lighters, 2 small backs with very little remnants of weed, all inside a bigger ziploc bag. I didn't know what to do, so it put it in a bigger plastic bag and put it in the garage. I wanted to call the cops on his ass so badly so he's go to juvie and maybe learn his lesson, but I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do because the parents keep guarding him. 

To this day, it's still in the garage, in the same place. 

I have no idea if he's doing any more than just smoking weed, but I've never doubted that he was off  anything. In retrospect, I probably should have reported what I found right away. 

He's got a different phone by now that he can't really abuse. Last night he left the house 2am. He tried to sneak out when I was on the couch watching a movie. I heard the door close real loud, how the hell would I not notice? I was wondering what the hell he could be doing. Probably smoking pot or some shit. 

I locked all the windows and doors so he couldn't get in because he typically never has keys, then I went to sleep. To my surprise, I found him sleeping on the couch in the morning, with keys by his side to get in the house... and his phone. 

I grabbed his phone and looked at his messages. He's got 3 conversations; 

* 1 talking about some sale on craigslist
* 1 saying ""i gave a guy your number hes got weed"" and ""he's got a pound of some fire"" 
* and the last one talking about sneaking out and meeting at a mcdonald's nearby at 2am to exchange something for $150 ~~which I can only assume to be weed~~ [[EDIT]]: I reread, and apparently it was for some iphone? Still suspicious as hell. 

I have no idea where he gets money, but it sounds like he can get $500 a week somehow. While I was watching TV last night, he bragged to me ""My wallet has $300 in it and now it's gone because I bought this iphone."" I asked him where the hell he got that money and he said ""none of your fcking business."" WELL, EXCUSE ME. I'm over here struggling with paying for almost all of my things, taking care of myself with no income and relying on my own scrimped up savings I've had since 6th grade. 

I don't know when he got back, but he just woke up (11am). Probably smoked a ton and came back home. If I searched him, he may or may not have stuff on him. If I told the parents, they would try to solve it on their own, but they can't. If I went to police, I don't know if it would be of any help because I've had bad experiences with cops. Not because I'm a bad kid or anything, but them wrongfully accusing me of things,  but that's a completely different story. 

I'm currently holding onto his phone right now and he doesn't know I know (yet). This is cheesy as hell, but I want justice to be served. He's gone way too long, getting away with everything. If you're old enough and you smoke weed, be my guest, that's your choice, BUT MY BROTHER. Honestly, I couldn't care less about him, but he deserves punishment and this is just ridiculous.

I don't know what to do.,35,6,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ljs7w/20f_my_30m_flatmate_punched_and_threatened_me/,"Brief background: We had a fairly small (maybe 10-person) party at our house last night. At 2am I came into the living room to find it absolutely trashed, broken glasses and bottles, my 2 flatmates throwing things everywhere, people vomiting, the whole nine yards. I had lectures (I'm a student) this morning so asked everyone to leave, at which point my 2 flatmates started to yell at me and call me names. At this point I just went and flipped the breaker in the corridor (essentially turning the house power off)

For this, one flatmate put his hands around my neck, pushed me onto the stairs and screamed at me. He then punched me in the face, though by this point a friend had come through (ie managed to witness the punch at least) and dragged him away telling him to 'cool off'.
Later, when going through the living room to check the damage, he illustrated what he did in front of our assembled guests, saying 'I didn't punch her, all I did was this' before slapping me in the face.

I'm honestly completely, completely shocked. I'd never have thought of him as violent. Our shared lease continues for another 10 months, and though I don't want to become a victim about it, I don't really feel safe living here any more. I'm in a LDR so my (furious) boyfriend can't stick up for me.

How can I get out of this situation? 

TL; DR: 30 year old male flatmate punched, slapped and put his hands on my neck last night. Contractually obliged to live with him for another 10 months. Am 20, female and very unlikely to ever win in a fight. What can I do?


Edit: Thank you so much for the advice. I called the police and got a crime reference number, which I'll apparently need to help me break the lease. They came round and checked everything in the house was okay, then called my flatmate, who denied the entire thing, and continued sending me abusive texts all day. They gave me the option for a restraining order and so on, which I'll consider probably more seriously once I'm properly moved out/off the tenancy agreement.

This could be much longer and more detailed but I am going to try and keep it short. 
Hi, I am a second year at college and I haven't made a single friend yet. Here's why... I go to school away from home, no one from my high school goes to my university, freshman year I never connected with my roommate, he was a frat guy and I am the exact opposite, I especially don't like to go to parties like most people. I also didn't connect with anyone in my dorm and by the time the groups formed I was left out. I am not socially awkward, I have little problem being an initiator and I would ask people to eat dinner, study, and sit by in class, but nobody ever did the same to me. In the beginning of the year we would all eat with each together then when the groups formed people would go around and knock on their group's doors to go eat, but nobody, not once, knocked on my door, and eventually I gave up on asking people to eat, study, etc. and spent almost the entire year eating, studying, and in class alone. Fast forward to this year and I have 2 new roommates, 1 is a 5th year that hardly talks to anyone and when he does it is painfully awkward. The other one is another typical frat guy that is I guess is nice and all but we have nothing in common and nothing to talk about. I'm a physics major so there aren't many people in my classes and they all have their groups and I don't know a single person, and not a single one of them knows me. So once again I have spent 3/4 of the year now completely alone all day every.single.day... At first I didn't mind because my hobbies include  guitar and video games, neither of which require friends to enjoy, but now it is starting to weigh heavily on me. When I talk to my friends from high school they all say how amazing everything is and they all have so many friends and some have girlfriends, and I haven't even exchanged numbers with a single person besides my roommates this whole time. I don't have a single person who I can even consider as an acquaintance, when I see people from my dorm last year they look right past me, sometimes I wave to them and they will wave back but if I don't wave to them it's as if i didn't exist. Another problem is school is incredibly hard alone. Studying and doing physics homework is extremely difficult to do all alone and everyone else in the class has at least one person to do homework with, but I have no one. 

I have no friends and it is making me incredibly sad and I don't know what I can do, I feel helpless mostly because everyone belongs to a group and I can't just pop into a group and become a part of it and be accepted. Please give me advice on what I should do, something besides ""lol just talk to some random person and then bam your their friend and welcome in there group"" or ""just join a club and you instantly have like 20 friends.""

I was hired as a seasonal/temp employee after responding to an actual position offer through an online ad. 

First thing they started to do was 'cross-train' me for a position I was not hired for. Apparently, they are short staffed and the holiday season has come around and they need bodies to help unload the trucks. Shifts start as early as 4am. 

Now, getting to the point:

Michaels enforces all employees to use a sign-in paper if you are asked to start your shift earlier than 5 minutes prior to your scheduled shift and to use the sign-in sheet if you are more than 5 minutes late clocking out. I am Always early clocking in 5 minutes before my shift and almost always asked to stay later than my scheduled shift by management. Michaels has a time clock, but I'm always getting told to use the sign-in sheet when recording my hours due to the erratic favors asked of me to stay later--just following the company policy.

My first paycheck seemed short. I didn't ask questions, I just took it and deposited it with the faint feeling that it was not correct. 

2 weeks go by and within those 2 weeks I am asked to stay later more and more. Which basically forces me to use the sign-in sheet to clock out more often. 

I've done the math on my hours after receiving my paycheck. I've worked 38 hours and I am only getting paid for 24!

I do not feel comfortable approaching the store manager because I think she is doing this on purpose to get a bonus. You see,(supposedly) if the SM can save on labor, they get a bonus at the end of the year. I feel like I am getting taken advantage of and this is criminal activity that hasn't been brought up. 

How can I prove that I am missing those hours when all I can go by is a sign-out sheet that has hand-written information?

**TL;DR Michaels Arts &amp; Crafts is shady. Obviously not paying me for hours I have worked. I don't think I have any way to prove that I actually worked those hours they are not paying me for due to having to write by hand my time worked.**",,False,,t5_2r367,1353158855.0,,,True,t3_13cm68,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/13cm68/my_paychecks_are_getting_skimped_big_time/,

I got a restraining order and will probably have to testify in court against the creeper. The police were incredibly helpful. Thanks for all of the replies, guys!

----------------------

Creeper was waiting for me at my bus stop today. Told me he's seen me around, I'm beautiful, he's in love with me, etc..

I tried to leave, but he grabbed my arm (hard).

I was stupid and tried to be polite. Ended up staying with him for over two hours. It was deserted, and he wouldn't let my arm go. He refused to let me leave.

He took my cellphone away from me when I took it out, and used it to take down my number, and add himself to my contacts list.

In the end, I promised him I'd meet up with him Sunday. (I have NO intention of actually doing so). That was the only way he said he'd let me leave. I was scared and didn't know what else to do. Calling for help wasn't an option since there was no one around.

He's called me 12 times since he last saw me (a few hours ago).

Thankfully, all he knows is my cellphone number and first name. He does not know where I live or go to school.

What should I do?

A) Answer the phone and tell him to stop calling.

B) Ignore the phone calls and hope they stop.

C) Other?



EDIT: Sorry for the wall of text...

TL;DR
A stranger came up to me and confessed his love for me and that he's been ""watching"" me. Won't stop calling. Physically restrained me in a deserted area for 2 hours until I promised to meet up with him on Sunday. What to do?

EDIT 2:
A police report? How do I do that? I don't want to just dial 911, since it's not an emergency. I'll ask my mom. I'm 20 and I live alone. I'll be double-locking the doors tonight!
And I have a boyfriend. Good idea to get him to answer! I told Creeper repeatedly that I have a boyfriend, but he didn't seem to get it... He kept saying he wanted to have sex with me :/

EDIT 3: Thanks for all the advice guys! I'll definitely keep you posted. I'm not going to do anything about it tonight though. The whole thing has left me pretty tired, so I'm going to be early today.

EDIT 4: So it's Tuesday now. The guy has been calling since Thursday. My boyfriend told him to stop calling.

Need to get back on track.",33,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/rhqv1/im_33_a_fifth_year_senior_in_college_i_live_with/,"First post is a doozy, downvotes ahead!

My last ""real"" job was in 2003, which I quit before the company went under for fraud. It's not to say I haven't had some sort of income these past years, but it's less than $4000 a year and basically all goes to help pay the bills - I live with my folks. How I make that money is through eBay and stuff I buy at yard sales, antique shows, flea markets, etc. I'm a fourth generation antique dealer (grandmother, father, much older half-brother, and myself).

But, I haven't been able to do that much anymore because of my weird health issue and because I don't drive. Before I would ride along with my dad when he went junkin' but he's 70 now and slowing down... And I can't ride in a car anymore anyway. You see, 2 years ago I got sick while out and about doing yard sales. It was likely caused by bad gas station food and the fact I'm a fat ass (300lbs), but since then I've been fucked up. Doctors have diagnosed me with everything from IBS to GERD to gluten intolerance... I've self diagnosed myself with IBS and severe anxiety when getting in a car for a ride. Once in the car, within five minutes I'm cramped up and slightly nauseous. It's not the same as motion sickness. In fact, I once took Dramamine just to make it to a meeting at my college and ended up in the ER because it fucked with my stomach even worse. It's really bizarre. Anyway, this feeling will get better or worse completely randomly. One time I might be clawing at the door, wanting to get out because I feel I'll either puke or shit my pants.. Other times I can go 20-30 miles with just the cramp icky feeling. And it's not like I can go to a specialist of have a procedure done, I haven't the money or insurance.

I have not gone beyond 30 miles from my home in 2 years because of this. In fact, recent count has me at 2 months since going more than 5 miles. Those of you living in a city might think that's no big deal. I live in rural upstate NY, in a town of just 300 people. It's 25 miles to the nearest ""city"" which is Ithaca.

Why don't I drive? I've never felt comfortable - at all - behind the wheel. It's just not for me.

As for college.. I'm going to end up with a BA in Cultural Studies at SUNY Empire State with a focus on writing and literature. What the FUCK was I thinking?? I went in debt for what??

Beyond that, I sit in front of my computer every day... I do all my classes online (and to say I actually do serious college work for my awesome grades ~3.7gpa - I've learned to bullshit so well that it's scary and I've not learned a damn thing.. Oh, read this novel and do a paper? Sure I'll ""read"" it...). I eek out a tiny living on eBay.

I'm becoming a burden on my folks, who are retired and I know they don't need me around, even though they love me being around. They don't mind that I don't drive, and I feel I'll never be a driver. I need to get OUT of this... I need to stop living like a basement dweller even though I live upstairs...

I have dreams but no way to know how to do them or get started. I'd LOVE to have a small slice of land in rural NY, start a berry farm, live off the land, be a quasi-hermit (I prefer being a loner, but that doesn't mean I don't like getting laid once in awhile), write articles and blogs about my interests/farm. Write short stories for self gratification more than publishing.

I have no support network. Siblings don't really give advice or help. Parents seem content/accepting of my life as it is. My only friends are online and in far away states. Hell, my last girlfriend was before my ""sickness"" and I flew back and forth between Ithaca and Phoenix.

Help?,37,9,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/eiyky/friends_get_pregnant_wife_gets_upset_i_get_angry/,"First a little background:  My wife and I are in our early 30s and have been trying to have children for MANY years now, with no success. We've done the whole basal temp stuff, ovulation kits, and gone through fertility doctors who found nothing wrong with either of us, but they did end up giving my wife a lot of meds that made her an emotional basketcase, and turned her off from ever returning to the fertility doc. She did manage to get pregnant once a few years back (after we'd given up at he fetility doc), but miscarried after only a couple weeks. She is in now in therapy and on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications that have seemed to be helping her a lot, with the therapist even suggesting a lot of our baby issues could be due to her anxiety problems.

Now the problem: My wife literally can not stand to be around anyone who is pregnant. This morning she found out friends of ours are pregnant and she became an absolutely inconsolable sobbing mess on the floor. This has literally happened every time she's found out any of our friends or family are pregnant. The first few times I was sympathetic and caring, but I've gotten to the point where it only makes me angry. Seeing red angry. I get angry at how she is completely unable to feel any joy for our friends. I get angry that she is now not going to want to have anything to do with this set of friends again. I get angry because she is completely unable to find any joy in the very good life we have together. I get angry because she apparently needs a baby to justify our life together. I get angry because she immedately takes a Nancy Kerrigan type ""why me?"" attitude, like she is being punished and I know that's absolute bullshit. I get angry because she immediately starts saying ""You're going to leave me for someone who can give you a baby"".

Other than the baby stuff, my wife have a fantastic life together and I love her dearly, but I'm starting to lose my shit with this stuff. I really don't know how to handle it anymore, and its just going to keep getting worse as more friends start getting pregnant. Any advice out there? Anyone had to deal with something similar?

My husband of almost 4 years dropped a major bomb on me the other day. Apparently he no longer wishes to be married . He claims he doesn't want the same things from life as I do anymore.He no longer wants kids, or to buy a house together, all he wants is to come home and watch TV and relax. He doesn't want to have to worry about someone else. He misses the bachelor life basically.  

Needless to say I am crushed. I asked him if we could work it out and he said no. I would like to try to make this work, but I am not going to beg someone to stay with me when they clearly don't want to. He wants to stay friends, not sure that is something I can do, but I'm willing to give it a shot. We talked about how we would split things up and for the most part agree on everything. I will be taking the majority of the furniture because most of it was given to us by my parents. He will be taking most of the electronics, because frankly they mean more to him than me. 

We would like to dissolve the marriage as painlessly as possible. Getting a lawyer would be incredibly expensive and I'm not sure I could afford one. He makes more than double what I make a year, and life is about to become a lot harder on me. He has agreed to give me a 2,000 down payment for a car, seeing as we only have one. I will in turn take my name off the title of our current car so that his name will be the only one of the title.  I should be able to get nicer, newer car with my credit and get the payments down to something I can afford, unlike our old car.

He has agreed to pay to break the lease on our apartment, he will be moving in with a buddy of his. He has also agreed to give me  $500 for start up money, and will be helping me with my bills for a bit until I can get a better paying job. There is no way I could live on the money I make now, so getting a better paying job is not an option. We are going to put all of this in writing to make it legally binding. I guess my question is whether or not this sounds like a good deal, or if I am entitled to more.

I am pretty okay with this arrangement,but my parents and friends all seem to think he is low-balling me, because he makes so much more than me. Also I should mention that before we were married he had over $7,000 of debt that  I helped him pay off during the course of our marriage. I was helping him make payments on it way  before he had a good job, and we were both working 40 plus hours at minimum wage.  Now I feel like I helped him pay off his debt, get a better paying job and now he is dropping me. Yes he is giving more than 3,000 dollars to help me get started, but 2,000 is going towards a car...which is probably about what I have put into our current car that we have both been making payments on now that I think about it. I'm not sure what to do, should I take the money and run? Or should I ask for more. Is he being fair, or am I just being greedy. Any input would be helpful.

A girl I grew up with recently got her CNA and got a job at an assisted care facility in our town. 

I was shocked she actually was able to get her CNA, and even more shocked when someone hired her, didn't pay it much attention though.

Some back story on the girl:

- She's been arrested numerous times for assault, and for possession of drugs. I'm guessing since most of these charges happened when she was under 18, it wasn't a factor in her getting hired somewhere or these places just don't really check their shit.

- She is constantly high. I've ran into her a few times while shopping, and she's high as fuck. She also sells Vicodin and Xanax to a few people I used to hang out with, know this for a fact, and this is why I no longer associate with her or any of them.

- She has a daughter that her mother now has custody over. She basically lost custody because she left her daughter unattended at a friends house, while she was getting high, and the baby got hurt. I don't know why she wasn't put in jail for this, except she was around 17 at the time and they thought removing the child was the best solution without implementing jail time.

- One of my friends dated her for a while, and dumped her because she beat the shit out of his dog while they were hanging out. This was about 4 years ago, she's 21 now. 

Okay. I get it, people change, I'm willing to overlook that and if she changed for the better, more power to her. But what *really* pisses me off? She added me on Facebook not too long ago, and (of course) I was snooping through some of her posts.

Almost every day, while she's supposed to be working and taking care of the elderly, she's making Facebook posts about how she can't wait to sneak to her car to smoke some weed, or about how she got x amount of y from [insert horrible name to call some old person here]. 

Even from that, I was like, okay fuck it, not my business. Yeah, it sucks that she's stealing (if she is?) but there's not really anything I can do about it. Until 3 days ago, she posts a status saying ""If this fucking old hag doesn't stop being such a stupid cunt to me, she might just have a 'little accident' in the form of me pushing her out of her fucking wheelchair. Don't fuck with me you old ass cunt.""

It really pissed me off, so I immediately googled where she works (I know exactly where it's located, but I was really hoping for a website) and all it gave me was their phone number, and the yellowpages listing. So now I'm just kind of at a loss here. I don't really want to be involved in it, but she's posted a few more statuses about hating the people she has to take care of, how she wishes they would just die already, and that the only good thing coming out of it is that she gets to yank a few pills when she makes rounds. 

Knowing this girl, I honestly can't say that she wouldn't be above hurting someone, especially someone who is defenseless. I feel like I kind of have an obligation to say something about it or at least report her to her employer. Mostly because, my grandma was in a nursing home and I saw how people treated her. Eventually the place got it's shit together and hired people who actually gave a damn. Stealing pills is one thing, but threatening to push someone out of a wheelchair? I get it, you hate your job, but you don't post stuff like that on Facebook. 

So Reddit... what can I do, or what should I do? I don't want to start shit with her, so I'd rather it be completely anonymous if I did report her, but I just don't know how to go about doing that.

Hey folks. In any post on Reddit there's usually some great &amp; ""how did I not know that before"" information. I've always been a ""lurker"" but I've been trying to be a more active member of Reddit. So here goes!

I got into a sour deal via Craigslist. My girlfriend loves pro wrestling &amp; we're in Upstate New York, so we decided to find Wrestlemania tickets. I found a great pair from a guy in Windber, PA &amp; at a great price. He wasn't looking to make any money, he just wasn't able to make it so he had to get rid of the tickets. He sent me photos of the tickets along with several forms of ID with his **home address** on all of them. He also emphasized that he's been burned on Craigslist before. So we were both very very cautious. What we ultimately agreed upon was me sending a money order for the first ticket, then he sends after he gets it. Then we would just do the same thing over. I sent the money order along with a prepaid envelope (both certified &amp; with tracking information), saw that it got there, &amp; last I heard from him he was heading to the post office to cash in the money order &amp; send the ticket. Throughout the entire transaction he kept giving me reassurances. I know that doesn't really *mean* anything, but I saw him as a real, down to Earth person &amp; not someone looking to rob anyone. He even went so far as to send me a photo of the confirmed shipping of the money as reassurance. I know it was dumb to get into this in the first place, but I've always had great dealings on CL &amp; I like to think I know how to pick out genuine people. Here I am nonetheless. I've texted, emailed, &amp; called &amp; I'm being ignored completely.

So... that's the situation. But I have a TON of his personal information. His home address (as I mentioned), photographs of his drivers liscense, a speeding ticket, &amp; a piece of mail. All with his address on it. Then his email &amp; his phone number, obviously. Also, he's not exactly hidden from the internet. All I have to do is Google his name &amp; a ton of information comes up. Finally, all the negotiation &amp; agreed-upon arrangement is right there in all the email.

I don't think he was out to rob me in the first place. I believe he just might've gotten a better offer &amp; he went with that. He hasn't put the ad back up either. I checked constantly. He's sorta sticking his tail between his legs &amp; hopes I stop trying to contact him &amp; drop it altogether. He doesn't seem very... smart. He mentioned that he lives with his mother in an apartment. He's 26 (sorry if I'm offending anyone). He's not very computer savvy &amp; he doesn't even have a bank account. I'm thinking this is the first time he's attempting something like this. In our negotiation he suggested that I could always come find him &amp; ""kick his ass"". I do not want to do that, but I certainly have the information to get me there.
So... is there anything I can do???

**TL;DR**
I was robbed $300 for a ticket on Craigslist, but I have a ton of his personal information. What can I do?

Edit: UPDATE: Thanks everyone for your kind attention &amp; help. I've sent him an email laying out what I plan on doing, still no response. thrway428976 suggested I post this in /r/legaladvice which is what I will proceed with.

**Also, I found his facebook account. It's very open. His birth date is listed &amp; it matches the birth date on the ID photo he sent me. Oh yeah, &amp; I found his mother's account too...**

UPDATE 2: Still no response. I gave him another call today &amp; told him how bad an idea this is &amp; that he's very very traceable. Thinking ahead on how to practically proceed. ALL of this great info is being used.

Also, there's a lot of questions about his real identity &amp; that this might be identity theft. He sent me a photo of his license with his address on it. The address I mailed to. His facebook account (which is open) has the same birth date as his ID. Same person in the picture too. He talks in the same type of retarded way on facebook as he did in the emails (lots of ""dude"" &amp; ""man"" &amp; ""lol"" etc). I sent via certified mail that requires a signature. It was missed the first time around &amp; he took care to send a picture of the ""we missed you"" tag. His name &amp; addr is right on that too. So unless this ""other person"" also lives there (sure, it's possible) but uses his email &amp; facebook... it's him. I would love to hear a layout on how it could *not* be him. I really can't wrap my head around the possibility of this being from another person, but I'm certainly open.

He constantly tells us he hates living at home, avoids conversations about going out/meeting new friends, has never had a girlfriend (relatives think he's gay, but our family has made it clear that even if that is the case it wouldn't change our love for him). He graduated from school, but hasn't found a job (it's been about 2 years). Whenever I visit and ask him how the job hunt is going, he just rattles off excuses like it's the economy or that he's trying. Sometimes my dad and other siblings will send him job listings or recruiters we've talked to **FOR HIM**, but when **WE** follow up with the recruiter they often say *""Oh he never contacted us.""* We basically have to **FORCE** him to apply and even when he does, it's like he half-asses it.  
  
I've had many heart-to-heart conversations with him because I wanted to make sure he's not suicidal or anything, and I find that he has aspirations and ambition, but no motivation to **DO something**. It's like the times he tries to lose weight, he'll make plans and diets and what have you, but 2 weeks into it quits and it's back to the same old same old.  
  
My dad/other siblings are about to snap on him and be blunt, basically they just want to tell him that by doing nothing he'll end up and stay a loser (I think he knows that, but maybe just has to hear it?). I mean at 18 that's okay, because you still have school, etc, but at 25? Seriously??? My mom is afraid of us being so blunt with him, but the alternative is what...doing the same thing over and over and hitting 30? I feel like he's just postponing his life and waiting for it ""to start"", but doesn't realize you can't keep waiting forever.  
   
So what would you? Should he be forced to leave and to pack up and move somewhere, try to get a start on life without having to rely on other people for bills/food/etc? Have you ever had someone like this in your family?

I'm currently searching for the son of a close friend of mine.

I've got material to start with but I will need directions and pointers, somehow, and pieces of advice for treating this delicate matter, for sure.

If any of you had a similar experience, could you tell me how this went and please point me in the right direction (I'm living in Paris and have to do this from distance). 



For starters, I have [this piece from the Harvard Library](http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00206) that states the following:

    Anna Kennedy Parrish had a son, Jean Christopher Parrish (born ca.1965) with Michel Chanderli.



My friend is the third person mentionned, and had no idea the first gave birth to the second, before he finds out during casual ego-googling. 

This family story is quite complex, not going for the plain FB fishing here.

I'm still trying to fill out the blanks.




I believe in the awesomeness of Reddit, and I'm sure the community is cut up for this. 

Any help to confirm the story, is VERY MUCH WELCOME.

(For instance, I'd like to know the usual way for consulting the materials from the archives at Harvard. For now, I'm looking for the source of the information, I'm pretty sure it's in the correspondance section of the file).




[Orig.edit]

Just signed up.
First post on anything near-reddit-like in years. Plus, english is not my first language, hope I won't be misunderstood, blah blah blah... I'm pretty sure this is the right place to ask for this, blah blah...
A good friend of mine asked me to investigate for him. We know each other by living in the same neighbourhood in Paris, the one with famous gangsters. We talk a lot, I'm a flick-freak myself, he knows a lot about movies, old ones, some very old ones, he was in the industry for a time, had a little glory, not much, got his load of ups and downs.
Yesterday he told me the following story: after ego-googling himself, he found out a child may have been born from one of his adventures. The fact is related here, in a excerpt from Harvard University Library, search in linked page for ""(born ca.1965)"", this is where it's mentionned. From what he explained, she left for San Francisco after they broke up, had their child; he was just left out of the picture. I double checked him, I cannot doubt his story, he's my friend and I'm totally doing this.
I would like advice from a benevolent community like Reddit, so this goes for the best. I have some infos already, 
I don't know if I can give names or what to do next.
I know this is gonna work, because I believe in the forces of Reddit.

1373189213.0,27,self.needadvice,1hsnrn,Many years ago I was abused by a teacher and I still haven't recovered. I don't know what to do.,30,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1hsnrn/many_years_ago_i_was_abused_by_a_teacher_and_i/,"This will probably be a long post, since I tend to ramble on once I get started. I've wanted to post this for a long time now but I could never face typing it out, but here it goes..

So the story starts in primary school. Life was good, I had friends, I was very active and energetic, as a normal kid would be. Once I hit year 5 in school (around age 9-11, I'm not really sure) I had a teacher who took a dislike to me. I've spent many, many hours wondering about this, and I never came to a conclusion why, but he decided that I was his target. I was a smart kid, I was at the top of my class every year all the way until this teachers class. It was by no means because I was a bad student, but now I'm rambling. 

Getting to the point... like I said, he decided I was his target. By that I mean, every single day for the entire school year he would bully me, humiliate me in front of my whole class. One of the things he would do is get a baby doll from his desk and throw it at me (literally, at me) then he would spend the next 5 minutes mimicing a crying baby and calling me a cry baby and saying things like that. Naturally, the whole classroom laughed, except me. This went on for the whole year. I told my mum one time and she obviously was pissed and spoke to the headteacher and she said she'd ""sort it"" but it never happened. It continued until the next school year when I got a different teacher.

Ever since that year though... it changed me. It fucked me over completely. My confidence was shattered, having all your friends laugh at you because a TEACHER decided he didn't like you and wanted to take the piss out of you for his own sick amusement really gets to you, especially considering how young I was.

So, high school comes along and I go to a different high school to the rest of my school friends. You'd think that was a good thing but it wasn't, I didn't know anyone and as I said, with my confidence shattered I was too scared to make friends. I basically just hung around with the rejects that didn't care if I stood with them at lunch (that sounds harsh, but, I don't know how else to describe it). I was a straight A student, so I was in the top classes for every subject, and my group of friends weren't. So, every single class I had, I was alone. I had no friends in any of them, I couldn't make friends in them. I suffered through the first 3 years of high school alone, scared, being bullied.. until the 4th year I stopped going. I literally just stopped, never went back again. Didn't do a single exam, most of my coursework went unfinished.

Needless to say, I left school with nothing. No friends, no qualifications. I went from a straight A student to a stain on the feet of society. I couldn't get help from anywhere, I struggled to even have a conversation with my own mother.

It wasn't until a few years later when I finally decided to do something about it. I was diagnosed with social anxiety, depression, etc.. I'm at the point where I know I have an issue but I don't know how to overcome it. I went to therapy and it didn't help at all, I'm still too scared to leave the house alone. Not to mention, I'm now 20 years old and I have no qualifications, literally no future. It's been ~6 years, and I haven't done anything during that time. I feel like my memory has deteriorated and if I tried to go to college or something I would struggle compared to how I was in school. I really don't know what to do. I want to get my A levels, go to uni, get a degree and move on with my life. But I can't. I'm stuck in the house because I'm literally too scared to be outside.

I guess what I'm asking is, how do I go forward? How do I overcome such a traumatic experience from my childhood? When (being optimistic here) I overcome my anxiety, how do I go about sitting A levels when I have no GCSEs? 

Oh, one more question. Is there anything I can do about said teacher? I know he still works at that school, and I know if he fucked my life over I'm sure he's done it to other children too. I can't be the only one. Unfortunately it's probably my word against his... is there any way I can do something about it? He shouldn't be allowed to work with children.",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_1hsnrn,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1hsnrn/many_years_ago_i_was_abused_by_a_teacher_and_i/,

He lost a leg to an infection, and can't get around with his electric wheelchair.

Recently, it blew a tire, and it took a ton of work to get Medicare to cover the fix, and weeks to get a technician in.  Obviously, we were incredibly grateful they did so, as we are not in the position to fix it ourselves.  My entire family is very, very poor.

**I would like to take this moment to say, I am not asking for money.  Please keep reading.**

This evening, as we were heading home on the bus, it was standing room only, so I was leaning up against the side of the bus next to his wheelchair and chatting.  I shifted my weight, and somehow got my foot on his footplate, and there was a loud and sudden crack.

When we got off the bus, it's clear the cover on the front of the wheelchair (it goes over the internals and both large front wheels) has tilted to one side.  The wheel on the left is dragging on the cover, and before we have even gone a block, we can both smell melted plastic.  The wheel is scraping against the cover hard enough to melt and curl up the rim of the plastic wheel-well.

Obviously he can't drive it in this state.  We're terrified he's going to damage it worse, pop the tire, tear up some of the internals, or worse, break the driveshaft.  At this point, I am fairly sure (or at least, hopeful) that the damage isn't too serious, it's just the cover.  Maybe, please, dear god.

Here's the crux of the problem.

I am visiting from out of state.  I go back in a week.  He's divorced from my mother, she won't help him, and my sibs are fairly self absorbed, they won't either.

While I'm here, I can help, but I need to get this fixed before I go.  While it is possible (though unlikely), Medicare will cover this, he can't take care of himself without the ability to get around, and he lives along, so I need to figure this out before I'm no longer here to help. 

Pertinent information:  we live in Los Angeles.  The chair is a hoveround, model unknown (tell me where to check and I will)

Anyone know enough about wheelchairs to give me advice?  If you can tell me how to take the cover off, I can take pictures of the insides to help you help me figure out the damage.  I think it needs a special wrench, though.

Alternatively, anyone know a shop I could call with decent prices?  Or someone with a tech who would be willing to give me a discount on his time, at least a little?  Maybe a program that does outreach for wheelchair bound people?

I enjoy programming, and when taught the right way, I enjoy math.  I guess in theory all of these things should make me a good candidate for a computer science degree.  My grades would disagree.  One thing that I should take into consideration is that at my two-year university, I couldn't take any Computer Science courses.

The only problem is that I see my professors as just that, professors.  They aren't people.  They don't act like people.  They don't seem to have feelings, or understand emotions.

A little background: My family is very close. We regularly have family dinners with more than 20 people attending. I have never seen a holiday fight and never understood the jokes about them until I got married and dealt with my wife's family. Every single person in my family unit (grandmother's kids, their kids, and their kids) are incredibly important to me. My uncle T has always been one of my favorites though. He was one of the men in my life that taught me how a man should act. He helped to show me that being smart and curious was a good thing. That problem solving was an important skill. He was one of the few people in my life when I was young that said I should be proud to be a nerd and to learn all I could about computers and science and to not be ashamed of loving those things. We were very close up until a few months ago. Thats when the ball dropped. 

My aunt M called and said that we needed to talk. She told me that when she was a little girl of 5 or 6, my uncle T had molested her. This was very surprising to me because to look from the outside, she never showed any animosity or really anything other than love for her big brother so it was very much out of left field. She then went on to tell me that he had apparently molested my cousin S, his own daughter, as well when she was around the same age. Again this was a huge shock. S has always been very much a ""daddy's girl"". And not a ""daddy buys me everything"" kind of daddy's girl. She was very much a ""I want to grow up to be a farmer like my daddy"" daddy's girl. Like he could do no wrong in her eyes. But M wasn't finished. Apparently the reason all of this was coming to the surface now, many years after the fact, was because T was about to be arrested for doing the same thing to S's daughter, R. R is just 5. She is the sweetest little girl you could meet and I love her to death. I am so worried about what this will do to her and if she will be ok. He has confessed. This is not an accusation on her part but something that was brought to S's attention by R. S got police involved and T has confessed and is in jail awaiting arraignment. 

Reddit, I need advice. I don't know how to process this information. I don't know how I should feel. I love this man but I can not excuse what he has done. There is a part of me thats is sickened by the thought of him. That what he has done deserves the strictest of judgment. And there is another part of me that sees him as a man succumbing to a sickness in him. My mother wants me to help her put a collage together of family pictures so that he has something in jail to remind him that people love him because she is afraid he may try to kill himself over what he has done. I refused based on the fact that i would not send him pictures of his victims even with their consent if I had it (I didn't), nor would I send him pictures of anyone that didn't agree to it. I understand she is trying to help look after her sick brother, but she isn't seeing how that hurts her own little sister, his victim. This is starting to tear my family apart. I want to talk to my aunt and cousin and tell them how sorry I am that this happened. I want them to know that I love them and that I am on their side in this, but I find it difficult to talk about and I don't want to bring anything traumatic to the surface. It has to be hard enough for them to deal with evrything. But I am also having trouble just throwing away my uncle after 34 years of him being there for me, even if i feel disgusted by what he did. I am a man torn.

TL:DR - My favorite uncle molested his sister, daughter, and grand-daughter and I am having trouble dealing with my feelings on the matter.

The roommate in question ('the hacker') showed me a script he used to use when servicing computers that gave him admin command prompt access on the windows lock screen using the accessibility button ""since no one ever has clicked that button, who would know"". After mysterious screenshots from were sent to the ex by the hacker of Facebook messages, emails, etc to show the ex how bad of a guy he was, how he sleeps around, how he watches porn, etc surfaced, I tell the victim to check for the hack, and sure enough, its there. We also figure he is sniffing packets and spoofing login details to get into gmail because he asked questions that would only arise from seeing specific emails. The victim has had to resort to using his phone on 4g to access sensitive sites like Facebook etc, password lock everything, change all his passwords, enable 2 step verification, etc. 

How should we confront the hacker, and how can we prevent further data compromise, since he has physical access to the computer in question and time alone when we are not home? How do we handle if the hacker refuses to come clean and cease? Are there any legal repercussions?

We like the guy, and before the girl got involved, everything seemed OK and we were good friends. We would like to return to that point, but have been trying for a few months now and it only seems to be getting worse.. Neither the victim or myself have dealt with such trust issues before so we don't know how to handle this properly and don't want it to escalate any more than it has already.

I think it was something like a 2.0 for the year. Despite improving in my senior year with above a 3.0, I wasn't able to recover from the blow and wound up with a 2.73 cumulative GPA. After I left college I wouldn't look at any job that asked for a GPA or transcript and ended up leaving the country to teach in the developing world because I was too ashamed to try and find work in the states.

I've been out of the country now for five years, living in three different countries and working as a teacher and administrator. I've been starting to think that I should head back to the States and settle down but am finding it impossible to think about applying for jobs or even just thinking about what I would like to do in the states. NGOs and non-profits all seem to want advanced degrees and corporations don't seem to need people who taught in third-world countries. Teaching is out as I'm not certified in the US. I've thought about applying to a grad school for one of those fancy degrees to work at an NGO and build a stateside life, but that requires showing that low GPA and finding professors who remember me and aren't still bitter about me flailing around their department while I was failing. 

I'm starting to feel like I'm going to be stuck out here if I don't make it back soon. However, no matter how much I've done since college I can't seem to shake the same failing that left me paralyzed right out of school.

I was a nuc electrician's mate on a SSN out of Guam. 
I was discharged for alcohol rehabilitative failure. My failure was non-substance related but because I broke facility rules because I was told once I came back they were going to put me back on a boat.

A little background on my submarine experience, I was onboard for 2.5 years, and in that time we had ~30 people 'go sad', meaning they would go to the Chaplain or the Doc and say they were going to kill themselves. Not all of them were true cases of people being depressed as a lot of people just wanted out because our CO was abusive as all hell, worked us past our breaking point on every occasion he could, being especially hard on the engineering dept. He did not hide this, even going so far as to confide in another officer, in front of everyone in the control room. ""Blue shirts (enlisted) are like tools. You use them til they break, and then get a new one.""

 Anyways, he was the Commodore's favorite prodigy, and the practice of all upper leadership actively discouraging anyone from speaking out, because in the Nuclear Navy, any attention is bad attention. I guess what I'm trying to say, is the environment was comparable to Battered Wife syndrome, not that I'm comparing this to spousal abuse, but it was the feeling of not having a way out, and even if you called the cops, they wouldn't be able to do anything.
 But anyways, here I am now, no GI bill because my discharge is general under honorable conditions, not a pure honorable, I'm not covered under VA benefits for jobs because I was never diagnosed with any sort of disability, apparently depression and anxiety and flashbacks to the service on a daily basis don't count. I can't find a job that requires any specialized training, even as an electrician, because every opening I've found requires you to be licensed (the state union doesn't recognize shipboard electrical work as prior experience), or have a degree, and well, finding a simple job hasn't happened yet either because everyone's full up until kids go back to college. I don't have connections for work, I'm broke, I don't even want to go outside anymore. I beat myself all the time because most of the people I worked with disowned me when I left, because I asked for help, because I worked 120+ hours a week every week if not underway, and hadn't taken a day of leave in 2.5 years because, we didn't have the manning to support. 

When one of my friends onboard tried to hang himself for more of less the same reasons, port/stbd duty days, no leave, he was showered with concern and given an honorable discharge w/ full benefits. I got tossed aside because I gave up, because after asking for help and waiting 8 months to start any sort of treatment because the CO refused to send out the paperwork before he transferred, when I fell apart and couldn't do it anymore, it was because I was a piece of shit, and worthless. I busted my ass and gave so much to a bunch of people who called themselves my family, and when I fell down, they just kicked me over the side. 

I don't know. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm a failure. Everything I worked for, all those days I told myself ""don't worry it'll be okay because after I get out college is paid for and things will be okay. It's not okay, I feel betrayed by my country, that every time it came up that we were undermanned, overworked, and couldn't hold out on what we had, we were told by Big Navy that it would get better eventually, we would get people we were supposed to have, but we never did. I was always told, ""We can't support"" that was what I got, we don't have the people available.

I've emailed a counselor and a few trusted mentors about this, and looked up these various problems (impostor effect, depersonalization, schizoaffective disorder, etc.).

For obvious reasons, I can't give out too much information. I'll give what I can to get the best advice possible.
I am seven months pregnant and I was fired today for no apparent reason. I'm a contract security officer and yesterday while on duty at my post, a situation/incident occurred with one of the employees of the client (I'll call him Tim). I was following protocol per both the client and my employers policy regarding vendors. I asked Tim to to handle the vendor. He refused and told me to call somebody else. However, protocol states that Tim was the appropriate person to call.
Nobody went to go meet with the vendor and we left it at that because I am not allowed to leave post and nor do I have clearance/authority to sign off with said vendor. A couple minutes passed and Tim approached me and had asked if I had gotten a hold of someone. I stated that nobody was answering my calls. After this, he left and one of my supervisors was walking by and I was crying. She asked what was wrong and I had told her what was going on. I told her that whenever this comes about, it becomes an argument pretty much and that I'm left to deal with it even though it's not part of my job except to make the initial call. She then asked me to write a report so she could help me sort the situation out. After this, she went home and I returned to my duties.
Tim came back to the building and approached my post and asked me if I had "" that big problem taken care of."" in a very mocking tone. I just looked at him, and he continued to lecture me as well as telling me to ""grow some balls."" I was shocked and offended and I had started to tear up when he annoyingly told me to stop crying. He then threatened to call the ""big boss"" and to pretty much tell on me. I told him it wasn't necessary because the situation was being taken care of but, to go ahead if he felt he needed to.
I contacted my supervisor to inform him of the situation and I was then relieved of my duties. I later received a call by my supervisor that I was not to return to work and that I was being investigated by both my company and the client. However, I was asked to write a report and bring it in.
Today, I brought in the report and was treated as if I was already let go. My supervisor couldn't/wouldn't tell me exactly what the situation was. I left to gather my things from my post and went home. About an hour ago, I recieved a call from my company stating that I was fired. I asked for an explanation. They didn't give me one besides the repeated "" The situation and client called for it.""
I have done the research on protocol and it stated that I was following the procedure correctly. I also didn't initiate any arguments with Tim and I acted in the most professional manner up until I cried.
I feel like I was wrongfully terminated, harassed, discriminated (pregnancy) and that my rights have been violated not to mention, I have no job to provide income for my soon to be daughter. I don't know exactly if I have a case but, I would like to know if anyone can provide me with any legal advice on this situation.

 We've been together for over a decade. But he changed in the past year. Actually, he slowly changed when our family pet died.

He still has its corpse in storage and it's been 3 years. Won't let it go and if I try to do something about it he gets very heated at me.

He's now become very obsessed with Hitler, very racist. Never used to be this way. It's all he talks about now. It's impossible to have a normal conversation.

He drinks too much, jokes about being an alcoholic but doesn't see the reason behind AA. And I keep asking him to quit drinking. I've quit drinking myself

He has mixed medications with alcohol(he has ADD and a doctor gave him antidepressants), blacked out and starts talking in strange tongues and then tried to choke me. This last time, I tried to leave the house but he grabbed the lock and twisted the key as he pulled it out so i coudln't use it again, continued to choke me until i begged him to stop and say sorry. 

So far I've been unsuccessful to get away from him because he has some sort of anemia that cases him to bruise very easily. to the point that he was railing my body against walls and the doorway and such, he ends up with bruises on his limbs. 

when I start trying to leave, he says he'll call the cops (or if I call the cops) he will tell them that I did it to him(gave him the bruises). He does this as a threat to keep me with him and 'behave'.

This last time I started seeing flashes during the strangling and knew i was close to passing out which I was paranoid of doing because if I passed out, there is no physical resistance i could put up to stop him from going too far and killing me.

He uses his forearm for cutting off my air and it leaves less of a mark. I've seen doctors and they can't visually see it on me so I just say I fell and hit the back of my head which is my excuse to get pain killers for my back and neck afterwards. The only thing physically noticeable is the muscle spasms around my spine near my neck. I had a physio note that the muscles around my c-vertabre around my neck have been stressed tight and damaged(that was on my first choking). 


This still doesn't seem like it would be convincing to a cop that any abuse has happened. So I don't think I can get help that way. And I think it's a very effective method to accidently go overboard and kill a person because of the lack of marking and the disregard of it medically prior to becoming fatal so I feel very alone and abandoned in my recieved abuse.




He is very offended that I no longer wish to have sex anymore. I've stopped altogether for two months now. Says that it's no longer a point to have a relatoinship yet still won't let me leave. I am somewhat hoping that the lack of sex will make the idea of me leaving him more appealling for him. But it's more that I find him to be the most icky person on the face of the planet and it is painful that I have to see him every day.


I just never want him to touch me again and his insensitivity to his behaviour towards the recent events and expects everything to go back to normal has me in a slump.


I'm currently looking online for roommates. But I know that it will be a long time before I can do anything as he's always home, does not have a job and could decide to physically harm me if i try to leave again.


So i have to do it when he's not around and also need to stash my belongings somewhere.


Any advice on the best way to cleanly run away? We are not married.

This is when I look around and find myself at the bottom of this hole I'd been digging that whole time, but it's much much deeper and much closer to hell than it was at the beginning of my ordeal, and therefore, much more difficult to climb out of. It would have been much less exhausting if I'd just taken care of shit right from the start. 

And yet, I CONTINUE DOING THIS SHIT. I have no idea why. I'm not even sure why I'm avoiding the issues in the first place, but I do. I ignore things knowing full well (in the back of my mind) that I'm about to fuck myself over again. But the Justifications and Excuses (J&amp;E) Department of my brain overpowers the Rational and Responsible Choices (RRC) Department every. goddamn. time. 


I need advice on how to shut down the J&amp;E department and strengthen the RRC department so I can stop being a fucking idiot failure of life. Please needadvice? I need advice.

It started roughly 8 years ago when I was still in High School. Eczema, dermatitis, ringworm, fungal infection, etc etc were all thrown around by many of the different dermatologists I went to. I missed a month of school because it had spread to my face and my chest, completely covering those areas. I woke up in the middle of the night with a bloody shirt because I would scratch in my sleep. I tried to tie my hands to the bed post in desperation. I finally found a dermatologist who prescribed me steroid cream to make it go away. I felt like 
I was reborn.

Then the bad news. My body gets addicted to the cream, and I have to stop using it. Here comes the eczema full steam again. At one point I spent well over a 1000 dollars on acupuncture, and she was the best doctor I went to. She took time to help me and talk to me to figure out what was going on. We concluded I'm allergic to sugar and dairy. It helped a ton. But now, here I am at 24 years old with my thighs, ankles, and underarms all flared up. This long winded buildup leads me to my question. Are there any doctors out there that can help me from the inside out? I have no hope in traditional dermatologists who just prescribe me a topical solution and boot me out the door. Where can I find these kinds of doctors? Any doctors that work with herbs that can help me internally?

It may not sound bad, but this has become debilitating. I can't exercise because when I sweat it becomes worse, I can't sleep some nights because it flares up and I scratch and itch all night. When with my girlfriend I feel like I can't get as intimate because of this, even though she says she doesn't mind. Basically I'm lost. **If anyone can help me find a doctor that works with herbs, or uses internal means versus external means to help cure me please let me know. Anywhere in the Los Angeles area.**

I have seen a few psychologists for just a few visits each time and it didn't feel like it was getting anywhere. Right now I don't feel like anyone would ever be able to keep me from fearing death just by talking me through it like a shrink would. I have a very logical and persistent mind and every time I am in bed or in the shower without anything to distract me I dread that my mind will wander until I hit that sharp terror where I remember I will die.

This is *not* fear of seeing dead things or loved ones dying. This is *not* fear of my actual death, but rather the complete void that may come after. I feel like I am going to drive myself crazy if I keep obsessing over the idea that my existence as I know it will one day come to an end.

I think right now I need to focus on how to even talk to people, something I have absolutely no idea how to do. I don't know how to say hi to strangers, start up a conversation, or even participate in one unless I know the person. It's even kind of hard online.

So, reddit, what can I do? I'm getting really sick of this life and I want to give up my v-card at some point, as well as other life experiences that I've missed out on.

My parents never married. I grew up with my mother in my grandparents house. We weren't poor, I wasn't beaten, hell I went to Disney world... And unfortunately private catholic school. I saw my father a few times in my younger years but I was more timid and curious in his presence than anything. My mother made him feel like an intruder, as did his drinking. For that I tip my hat to her. Somewhere around age 8 my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was only in her mid 30s. She did her best to keep it from me but her hair was short and she traded the mini van for a little convertible. I was scared and so was she. She started acting like a friend, young and spontaneous. I could tell she thought she might not make it. Somehow in her mind, instead of just leaving me in the hands of our family, it made sense to find a man. A completely new stranger to date and hopefully marry before it was too late. That way I would at least be left with a father.

Each suitor scared me more than the last. The winner being the worst of all. My mother had surgery and radiation therapy. She bounced back fine. All just in time to find him. A disease in his own right.

It seemed each year after they met was a new mile stone. They were engaged, we moved in together, they were wed and then she was pregnant. then he got to work. It is clear to me now that by this point he had successfully broken both mine and my mothers spirit. This new stepfather slowly made all the right moves. I was barley a teenager. It was sick and I don't have to go into detail. it was to be our secret and I was never to tell my mom. I'm afraid that whatever anyone out there is imagining at this point will sum it up just fine.

She gave birth to his daughter, I started high school, but none of it stopped him. It was just a part of life now. I had accepted it as a pathetic existence that I somehow asked for long ago. You think at this point it couldn't get more complicated? Read on.

After my first year of high school I had a few close friends. Some of which I trusted enough to confide in. It wasn't long after that when word traveled to the right ears. My friend had a cousin that we used to hang with quite a bite, I grew really fond of him. In fact I felt safe when I was around their family. The information went to the adults in their family and the next day or two the cops were taking away my step father. You would think the story ends there.

He's gone, mom gets cancer again. I think my mind blocked out a large sum of my memories from this time. My mom was doing chemo and my family was always at the house, can't really call it home. I spent my time trying to get away, usually with the same friends and family that informed the cops of my predicament. That seemed to draw a line in the sand if you will. I was trying to go out like a normal teen and yet I remember getting dragged back and yelled at and being told I was selfish. Needless to say, I don't feel close to my family, not emotionally anyway. But unfortunately I feel that they are physically breathing down my neck. I understand that this will pass, but only in time and distance. people like my step father are wired to uproot families in this manner. at times it seems irreversible... but we will see.

Now don't get me wrong, I love my mother and I will never understand why a young woman like her had to go through all those things. Unfortunately as it stands now, we really do not see eye to eye. Some days she is kind but when we get to talking about my goals (career what have you) she makes it sound as if i am a free loader that mooches off of her. Her emotions and beliefs sway. She will say things like therapy is for weak people. Here is a good way to sum it up...

One day were at a red light. A young girl, maybe 12, just an average regular old girl riding her bike crosses the road in front of us. To which my mother says, ""see, why couldn't you look like that?"" I didn't quite know what she meant. ""...then none of this would have happened."" just so were all one the same page, im a six foot blonde, blue eyes, weighing in at 150. I can only assume by those words that she felt my outer attributes were to blame for the incident. I can only hope it was all the stress and chemo talking and not my true mother.

my first high school was private catholic. they told my mom things like ""they tend to hate god when things like this happen"" all i wanted was to be left alone and just be done with school at whatever pace i could handle but i was under their microscope. everybody knew. we decided i needed to transfer out and finish my last two years elsewhere. at that point i pretty much lost contact with the family i had trusted in. and for that matter I lost contact with just about everything. I wasn't drinking, smoking, cutting, anything like that. I just sort of shut down. In a sick way, i wish i could remember more.

About the same time I finish high school (a few d-bag boyfriends later) my step father finally gets his sentence. It wasn't without me having to talk about my vagina and his cock about 1000 times over in a court room full of strangers. his now dead father would stare bullets into my head as i tried to vocally recall the event between me and his 40 yr old son. He even had the nerve to try and appeal and so I got to relive the whole thing. All said and done, he's up for parole in 2017.

I received counseling until I was about 18 through agencies made for abused children but i didn't pursue any additional help. I'm beginning to feel a was a fool for not finding a new shrink ASAP.

okay, for those who are still reading and still care, turns out its not all bad. lets fast forward to present...

i still haven't given into any suppressed demons unless you count art, aquarium keeping and herpetology as unhealthy vices. most of my bad days I listen to some rage against the machine and get real angry and draw something awesome then call it a day. oh and remember my friend's cousin? the family that helped me? The one I mentioned earlier? well fast forward a bit. once I was free of high school, he and I both found ourselves single and well, we've been together for about three years. I still talk to his family. they treat me like one of their own and I can only hope they know I'm very grateful for that. thing is, he and I are renting my mom's basement (in the house where the abuse took place) for $400 a month... Let me repeat that...

I RENT the basement in which I was REPEATEDLY RAPED. Oh and would anybody like to guess how much money I make a month?... Here's a hint... If I'm lucky, its $400. luckily my bf makes more but still, its not the most glamorous life.
so why do i make so little we ask?

You see, my mom is still taking car of my half sister (im currently at home babysitting her which is probably why I'm venting like this right now) and I am a full time community college student trying to transfer to better university. I work one/two days a week and my mom does not pay a dime for my tuition. I'm a semester away from my associates and a second away from insanity.

So how do I pay for school? I call up my dead beat dad once a year and he helps me fill out my financial aid form. i didn't think i was able to cry anymore until that day, especially like that. He barely sounds like he's in touch with the world anymore. After all the drugs and drinking and can see why. Fun part is, I'm due to make that call again if want to graduate.

So that should sum it up. This is where I'm at now. My question is, how the hell do I get out? There's no one in my family I can turn to. Our income together wouldn't get us very far. All we know is we need to get out. I need to get the hell out. Yes its a monetary risk. But I already know for certain that this life is mentally damaging and just plain unhealthy.

The options I've been pondering are...
Transfer to fancy expensive college and rent nearby apartment, my bf works nearby and currently makes more than me.
Transfer to also fancy yet less expensive college where all my credits transfer and the tuition is much cheaper, thing is, we would both be starting new with no jobs about five hours from here.
Or just finish my associates and start job hunting so we can move out. (The bf is kind of against it because he doesn't want me to sell myself short)

anybody out there think there is some sort of Oprah quality story scholarship? i mean im getting sick of hitting walls with all this built up in me. why did i make it through this far if it was just to finish about 60 credit hours at a community college then just give up on all my dreams and settle for some job i may hate?

any advice at all on what to do? am i missing something, some option on how to survive on our own that ive overlooked? the economy is shit so im sure im not alone. i feel like this point in my life is going to somehow make or break me and i fear messing this up is going to somehow throw me back into a really dark place. i guess im paranoid that ill do what ive done before and subconsciously sniff out a lifestyle that mimics the abuse i once suffered.

A few months ago I was going through a very difficult time in regards to my friendship with one of my best friends. We argued a lot and I felt guilty for it, as did he. We slept together on several occasions, which didn't help things (but we're much better now). I feel like I might have slept with him because on some unconscious level I thought it would stop the arguments. I also am quite afraid of being hurt or letting people see my true emotions and things like that - I have difficulty understanding or expressing my feelings most of the time. I also feel like I could have slept with him because it meant we didn't have to talk about feelings or problems, for the time we could just forget about them.

So I got a new boss and the vice president himself told me that I was never put on the payroll and he would get on it. I trusted him too until I never received it. Called him and he said he'll send it soon and then the new boss showed up at my door the following week, as soon as I am about to leave to go work, telling me that I need to give her my equipment.

What a long hard road it has been. First, my wife was taken to a battered woman's shelter after the arrest, then told that if she did not sign a Restraining Order against me, she would never see our children again. Due to her making claim there was domestic violence (which there has been none) and the claims of abuse from my teenage daughter, the local Child Protective Services placed our children in a state of deprevation. 

My wife was forced to stay at this woman's shelter without the ability to leave or contact me or any of my family. She was forced into daily labor and religious classes. She was trapped by this place for nearly 5 months, until she literally had to escape.

She has now dropped the restraining order and moved back home. Our children have been interviewed by numerous child psychologists and have been found to be healthy and with zero signs of abuse. Unfortunately the CPS office is still claiming a state of deprevation for our children and will not allow us to bring them back home. Only my wife is allowed to visit them once a week, as they state I am a danger.

My teenage daughter ran from custody and has been living with her boyfriend during this entire period, exactly what she wanted, freedom from her parents, whilst our little ones are in a foster home they refer to as jail. They are also being indoctrinated into christian religion, which we do not practice. The local government continues to frame us as bad parents, although we have neither been indicted or convicted of any crime. 
We are at our wit's end, without any path to get our kids back home.

We need help!!! We have attempted to contact state offices regarding the local CPS's office abuse of power and disregard for our basic constitutional rights, but have had no luck. I am disabled and on a limited income, so I do not have the financial resources to hire an attorney, and besides, this area seems to be a 'good ole boy's network', so a local attorney may not be the best choice. We do not know where to turn to, or what to do. We are turning to Reddit in hopes of being guided in the right direction, we want our children home, and they are miserable without us.

Let's just call her Ashley. We have been together for 9 months. I'm 24. She's 23. Wonderful woman. Wonderful kids. I love them all. Ages 4(girl), 3(boy), 2(girl). The dad is still in the picture. Which sounds like a good thing, but all he does is make our life a living hell. Calls/text me and her none stop. No matter what the time is. Leaving nasty voicemails and text messages when we don't answer. He's the type of person that keeps on calling in till you answer or your phone dies. Even when it's 3 am and he's drunk. He sends her text messages called her baby and he loves her. He always telling me how Ashley and him get together and ""fool around"". I don't believe him, but this still eats away at me. He post things on his facebook and myspace about how big of a bitch she is and how he hates her. He found out where our old apartment was and would come over everyday. We moved. Calling the cops wouldn't do anything. They would always say they needed to talk it out since they both have custody. Ashley and I both work. All the kids are in daycare. She just started working about two week ago. I'm the one who's paying for everything. I treat these kids as they are my own. I love them all and would rather die before seeing them get hurt. I would do anything for them. As I would do anything for her also.

**Dad's Background:** He's 24. Unemployed and living with his mother in a bad part of town. He was abusive to her when they were together. He was also very controlling. He wanted nothing to do with her or the kids in till I came into the picture. He has a felony and is currently on probation. I know he has warrants right now. He hasn't been going to his probation officer (or whatever they are called) because of the warrants. 

**What happen:** Around 6pm he called saying how he wants to see all the kids and have them over at his mother's house for a while. We agree and take them over there. We drop them off at his mom's house. This was around 7pm. No problem. Ten minutes later of course we get a text about how she is a bad mother and she dropped the youngest one off with a dirty diaper and just talking shit. Like always....nothing new. We just went home to relax. He of course was calling her phone nonstop the whole time. When we finally went to go pick them up around 10pm. He said that his mom wanted to talk to her about one of their kids on the porch. I'm of course not allowed in or around his mom's house. So she went up there to talk to them. She was never out of my sight. Only on the porch. The kids were inside. After five minutes everyone is getting into it. He's yelling. While I'm waiting his girl friend pulls up and walks on the porch also. So at some point his sister (she's 19) comes out crying claiming that the oldest one was saying that I was touching her in her private areas and that I hit on her. I have never even laid a hand on the child and of course never touched her like that in any way.

I didn't know what was going on in the time. I was just in the car looking at them making sure he doesn't trying anything stupid. So she walking back to the car with only the youngest ones crying. I'm thinking he's trying to keep the oldest one and she is upset of that. Before she even opens the car door his girl friend is coming over to the car. All I can hear is ""...but what is it is true?"". I have no idea what this means at the time. My girl friend is telling her I'm not like that and I wouldn't anything to hurt them. I caught on to what was going on now. While I'm in shock and coming to terms of what's happening I notice the dad, brother in law, and his step dad are all outside coming closer to the car. As soon as my girl friend gets in the car she breaks down in tears. She was the one driving. She was in no shape to drive. I told her to move over and I'll drive. I didn't want to seem like I'm running away because then I would look guilty, but sure in the hell wasn't going to stay around to get jumped or possible killed over something I did not do.

I drove a few blocks away while she called the cops. Well apparently his sister already did and the cops were on their way. The cops told us to meet them back at his mom's house. A cop was already there when we arrived. I'm already emptying my pockets knowing I'm either going to be arrested or at least thrown in the back of a cop car. I was right. They put me in hand cuffs and put me in the back of the cop car. They already assumed I'm a pedophile so the cops are already treating me like shit. I can't blame them. While I'm sitting back there sweating my ass off they of course have the dome light on where everyone can see me. His whole family is there at this time just staring at me assuming I'm just a scum bag pedophile. I'm feeling completely worthless even though I'm not guilty. Odd how that works. So around 12:30 the cops tell me if someone can pick me up because I couldn't drive with my girl friend because they are going to the hospital to have a rape kit done to both of the girls. I have no idea how that process works, but I'm sure it's horrible for the girls. This makes me feel even worst. I called my mom and got a ride from her. I had no one else to call.

My girl friend called me from the hospital telling me the only reason they are saying this is to make our life miserable. As much as I agree with that statement I don't think they made this story up. He is a complete asshole, but not even him would want his daughter to go through this. Ashley now is talking about trying to getting full custody and putting a restraining order against him. I know this probably should have had happened a long time ago, but I hate the fact of taking the kids away from their dad. I feel like such and douche for that. She also never wanted to do this because she would hate the fact if someone took her kids away from her.

Sorry for the wording/typos. I didn't sleep last night and I'm not even thinking correctly anymore. Plus I was never the best writer.

Any advice on what should do? Should I still have sympathy for him? I feel so horrible even though I have not done anything wrong. I don't know what to do anymore. Thank for any input and for even reading this.

First time I'd ever had my own desk, phone line, business card, etc. First time I've had my job pay to have me travel out to and work at satellite offices while setting me up in a nice hotel, expensing my meals, etc. I've got fantastic benefits, room to move up in the company.

I've been here for 5 months, and I can hardly STAND it. Also, I'm not good at it at all. I can't seem to learn the products and their specifications, I hate picking up the phone and making cold calls (and I'm especially awful at it), I can't get myself to get involved with and beleive in our products, and be enthusiastic about them like my co-workers. I just can't seem to be able to pick any of it up, and i'm constantly having to ask the same questions over again. Every second of every day I am uncomfortable in my own skin. I come in and stare at my computer trying to make it look like I'm busy, and I value being a hard worker very much. Every time I interact with my co-workers they are always expounding on how lucky we are to be working for such the company, and how great it is.

The guy who has trained me has been phenomenally patient and helpful, and my boss is an incredibly nice, old-fashioned guy. They took a chance on hiring me, and have been so accommodating and nice. I am so disappointed in myself that I'm letting them down, and I have so much anxiety about it. 

I've only ever gotten jobs via networking with people, but I exhausted my limited network in finding this; Like so many, I'm terrified I won't be able to get another job. I'm feeling my lack of a degree really weighing on me, and my lack of any quantifiable, marketable skills.

It was going *okay* for a couple of months. I wasn't losing any weight, but wasn't gaining any either.


In the last month, however, I started going on daily burger sprees. It happened out of the blue. I don't remember any particular event triggering this behavior. I'd try my best to stop the temptation, but it just wasn't happening. Last week, I managed to go a complete day without succumbing to my urges and was relived that I had finally broken the cycle, only to wake up mid-sleep at 3am and head down to the 24 hr McDonalds.

I feel like I've become a completely different person over the course of a month (and not in a good way).

I had somehow convinced myself that the cravings are not under my control, which I used to downplay any feelings of guilt brought up by the binge eating. **FUCK THAT**.

Last night I decided to see if I could find them on Facebook. I did, to my complete surprise I also found my biological father. 
So here's the story. My mom left my biological father before she even knew she was pregnant with me, so as far as my family knows, my biological father does not even know i exist. I have a brother who is 14 months older than I. 
His background, based on what my mom has always told me, he was kind of a low life. He drank, did drugs and couldn't hold onto a job. Left his family in another country and wasn't allowed to return for a reason I do not know. He raised a hand at my mom so she packed up and left. 
I always assumed he wasn't still kickin anywhere due to his lifestyle decisions while my mom was with him. I never gave him much thought. Now that I know he is still around I am debating contacting him. Right now I'm really unsure and kind of confused. The weirdest part of all this is that he only lives about 8 hours away. 
I feel like I've created a no won situation for myself. If I don't contact him ill never stop wandering. Basically though I'm faced with 100 negative what ifs next to two positive what ifs. 
I know there's people out there who have been in this situation before, I hope some of u see this and can tell me about your decision and how it went for you. 
Appreciate anyone's thoughts right now!

Edit: there's more to this. Obviously he knew about my brother. He also knew where my grandma lived and he never once went there looking for my brother or as far as we know tried to find him. So this makes me think he probably would have no interest in us. We think he had quite a few kids. There's definitely 5.  Seeing his Facebook I just assumed he was clean, but I could be completely wrong which I think would really let me down. I also found his mom and dad on Facebook. I only found him less than 48
Hours ago. This is all still really unclear to me. It's funny, I never thought I'd be one of this kids that would ever be able to tell your biological father your his kid.
I think one thing that makes me really unsure is what it could do to mine and my moms relationship.

Until they took everything she fucking cherished to the dump. ,30,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/e4cua/we_had_just_moved_in_to_our_new_beautiful_new/,"Start of October, we had just moved in. Our new apartment had three bedrooms, two floors, and she liked the kitchen. We needed a boost in moral and this was going to be it.


On the top floor of the apartment there was two rooms, a large balcony off of one. She took that room as her studio, she's an artist,  practically everything she had we put in that room. The other was our bedroom. 


A little backstory is needed. She lost her Mom in May, and it hit her very hard. Her Mom was also an artist. When this happened, she lost all of items she kept from her Mom.


The landlord was having work done on the balcony &amp; the roof. When we moved in the balcony was in pieces in the studio room. The work would take four days and we were told it would be done right away. Which it was.


On the last day of roof work, it was a Saturday, she &amp; I were pretty hung over. We heard the workers come in &amp; get started. Then a phone call from the landlord, a fateful call. The landlord asked me to tell the workers to ""Please throw out the small pieces of wood from the balcony.""


I went to see the roofers, opened the door to the studio and one of the dudes was right there. He leaned on the open door as I motion to the wood and said ""Hey man, the landlord called and asked you to throw all the small pieces out."" He nodded and I closed the door.


We didn't see them for the rest of the day until they left. We used the front entrance to the house and have curtains on the back windows. We had an excellent day. In fact, it was the day before thanksgiving, in Canada. 


I wake up the next morning. I make some coffee. I feed the cat. I go back upstairs to have a smoke by the balcony door. Then it happened.


All of the little pieces of wood were gone,they got that part right, but so was everything else. They threw out all of her supplies, she makes jewelry. They threw out unfinished sculptures she intended to finish for her Mom. 


They threw out dresses from the closet, but get this, left all the fucking hangers. Camera's, ice skates, yearbooks, pictures, everything else you keep with you forever. 


It was all gone.


I woke her up and we spent thanksgiving at the dump trying to find...anything. We were not very successful.


Now the tough part. She is having trouble making a list of everything lost, and the landlord is pressuring us to come up with one. The landlord has not paid the roofer yet.

Advice please.,24,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/dscgh/my_boyfriend_runs_away_forrest_gump_style_when/,"Sorry for the long post. I really need some advice. I’m in a 3-year relationship with the guy of my dreams. He is 21 years old and I am 20. Even though we are both pretty young, I can easily see myself spending the rest of my life with him. Apart from the occasional bickering that all couples do, we have a great relationship.

My problem is this: over the past 6 months, there has been 4 occasions where my boyfriend has gotten out-of-control drunk. I was present for 3 of the times. The first time, as we walked back to campus, he insisted that campus was in the complete opposite direction and proceeded to run away. I had to have a friend drive me around looking for him; luckily, we picked him up a few blocks away from school. It then took me and 4 of my girlfriends to calm him down enough so that he would not run away and get lost again.

The next time, we were at his uncle's farm that had many electric fences to keep the cows in certain pastures. Again, he drank too much and decided to run away. Everyone was very concerned that he was going to get lost (the farm was huge and very unfamiliar territory to us) or run into an electric fence. After we caught up with him, it took 2 men (including his sister’s fiancé) and 3 women (his sister, cousin, and me) to wrestle him into submission.

Tonight, I picked my boyfriend up from the police station. He had been out for his friend’s 21st birthday and blacked out. He called me to pick him up but could not communicate to me where he was. After driving around the city streets with my roommate for 2 hours, the police finally called me to come get him. He had run away from his group of friends at some point and got very lost in a pretty bad neighborhood. Luckily, the police picked him up and all they gave him was a lecture.

What do I do about all this? I swore after the “farm incident” that I would end our relationship if I had to go through that again. There is absolutely no communicating with my boyfriend when he gets this drunk; he has hurt many people and lost a few friends by acting this way. Additionally, the terror I feel when my boyfriend is wandering around the streets extremely intoxicated and combative is more than I can handle. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if this is a legitimate concern of mine. I don’t know if I should insist he get help, tell him he needs to stop drinking, or leave him. I would really appreciate any advice you have.

For the last two months students serving ISS over these issues have been missing out in valuable class time (our school is one of the least ranking in our district in academics). ISS includes sitting for many periods at a time copying down a packet of rules that may or may not relate to the reason you are in there.  

So kids in my school were tired of this so we organized a rebel.  most students wore jeans with holes in them, as well as pajama bottoms.  The turn out was great!  the ISS room was so full they had to use the auditorium as an ISS room. About 50 students at a time were in there with kids constantly coming and going.  Now i want to know what I can do to take it to the next step and if theres a way in which you guys may help a girl out.

With help from therapy, I pulled myself out of depression and alcoholism, but went back to booze to cope when my ex-fiance developed a borderline personality in the fall, starting a long spiral that ended with my breaking up with her in May.

Last Wednesday I drank a bottle of port and a six pack of beer (a lot even for me) and started feeling pain, tenderness, and swelling in my right side. Went to the doctor today and my liver is dangerously enlarged. Bloodwork comes back tomorrow afternoon. It seems the best I can hope is that it will be something that will go away with total abstinence. On the other end of the spectrum is hepatitis with a mortality rate of 50% or greater within 30 days.

There are people ""there"" for me but nobody who is ""here."" My dad is the only one who knows, and he's been great, but he's also halfway across the country. I live alone and there are only acquaintances and casual friends within 300 miles. I have good friends I could call but I refuse to put them through the agony of not knowing as well. I teared up when I met my academic advisor two days ago and she hugged me goodbye because it was the first time anyone's touched me in months, to give you a sense of how isolated I feel.

I really think I'll be okay once I know. Of course I'll feel remorse and guilt if I'm handed a death sentence, but I spent a lot of time thinking about death when I was depressed and expect that I'll accept it easier than most. I just can't stand the feeling that everything has stopped until I find out. I've spent the last few hours shuffling around my apartment, chain-smoking, listening to ""The Tourist"" on repeat, and crying every 20 minutes. I don't know how I'm going to make it until tomorrow afternoon without becoming a huddled ball of nerves.

I am in high school, and so I am still very dependent on my parents to provide for me.

But there's an issue. My brother was doing a project, working on my fathers computer while ""daddy"" is in a city, and for some genius reason thought it'd be a good idea to look on my Dad's computer's history. So he did, and discovered an email account.

The email account's name has sexual connotations first off, but the emails were the worst part. All these emails were pretty much from some obscure part of craigslist, where people provide services for sex. That's weird to me on its own but even more so it seems to be people who are married wanting to cheat on their husbands/wives.

My father replied with good grammar and spelling, saying he's experienced at this! He's experienced at fucking strangers? God damn! How long has this been going on? Well we checked the oldest email and it was since last year! He calls himself daddy too, like some sort of sexual Santa Claus.

We are stumped on what we should do, and I feel uncomfortable taking this seriously. I have ideas too but my brothers protests fetter my plans.

I'm pretty sure its my father, although he claims to be 10 years younger, sends an older photo of him, and claims to be about an inch taller. All this seems to come together when I paired it with the constant flight delays from the place in Tennessee he just started going to. I want to speculate that his account was hacked, but he uses our ""family"" password, which is a password for general things, like wifi or the computers. He has a wide range of tastes, 30-50 about.

So, I need advice on what to do here. I hope for a solution that doesn't require my involvement by talking to him about this. Maybe blocking craigslist on his computer? 

I've no idea how to do that. I want to solve this before my other brothers try to because their methods will actually make a stupid sexual desire impact our lives! If anybody can help, that'd be great. I what this issue gone just as fast as it came!

It's perfect! Except for my neighbor. He is an old man in his 70s, maybe 80s. His name might be Carl, might be Ray, or might be George. He tells me something different every time I talk to him, so I am unsure. 

The first time I talked to him he told me that people are living in his attic and dropping acid on him at night. He is clearly confused. I think he might get home visits from a nurse, but they are few and far between. No family ever comes to visit him.

My issue is this: He has some kind of home alarm. It goes off multiple times per day, frequently between the hours of 2am and 5am, for around 10-15 minutes each time. Two nights ago it went off at 2:10am, 3am, 4:30am, and then again 5:40. Last night we were lucky as it only went off at 3:05am and then again at 4:10am. It is the loudest noise I have ever heard in my life and my bedroom window is the closest to his house. The cops NEVER come when the alarm goes off. I have no idea if it is linked to a central service.

The cops say they can't help bc he is probably setting it off accidentally. 

This is affecting me on a completely weird level and I'm not sure how to fix it. My wife's fix is ""Wait for him to die"" and I am thinking it will take the same. 

Reddit, please give me advice and help me get sleep again.

**Edit:** Called the cops and they came out and gave me a lengthy explanation about his current state. They have tried getting him into care, but have no valid reason to do so. He goes to the police station several times per month complaining of people in his attic. The cop told me the alarm company is dropping him at the end of this week as he has become a MAJOR hassle for them. I was told to jot down when it happens, call the officer, and then we can possibly move forward in the mental health court. In other words, deal with it until we can build a case against him.

I'm at THE END of my rope.",28,9,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/z39we/23f_im_attractive_and_intelligent_but_i_hate/,"Throwaway account.  Reddit, I've wanted to ask your advice for a while now, and I'm going to do my best to break it down for you.  Here's what's going on:

* I have had bad anxiety since childhood, which is the foundation on which most of my life decisions are based.  When I was 18, I had major heart surgery, which resulted in severe depression because I did not seek therapy afterwards (studies show that heart patients vs. other surgical procedures have the highest percentage of severe post-op depression), nor was I ever medically treated for the anxiety or depression at any point in my life.  I wanted to be strong, and battle it on my own, which I realize made it much, much worse as time went on.

* I am a 23-year-old senior, attending a snooty university in the southern United States (also where I was born and grew up).  I have a 14-hour school load, coupled with work 5 days a week.  Two weeks into the new semester, and I'm already weighing the pros and cons of dropping out because I haven't delegated any time for homework or studying, and am failing miserably.  I have made failing grades on all of my homework and quizzes, and I don't see myself being able to pull up said grades.  

* Attempting to balance work and school leaves me no time to make friends; I pretty much skulk from class to class, being hateful towards every harmless little sorority girl or good-ole-boy.  'Resentment' has been my end-all, be-all attitude for the past year, since I moved up to attend uni.  I feel like I was robbed of a young adulthood because of my surgery (I began community college when I was 20; university when I was 22).  I never got to be a fresh-faced, 18-year-old university Freshman with all the bells and whistles, no job, all the time in the WORLD to study and make friends... I feel like a loser.

* I now live with my serious boyfriend of almost 2 years, who is still looking for a job... The relationship pressure of me pulling all the weight has all but destroyed our relationship in 2 short months.  The guilt weighs on him very heavily, which, in turn, affects me.  I come home around 10pm, exhausted, with about 3 hours of ""me time"" (the only time I get to study, which clearly doesn't happen) before going to bed.

* I *constantly* compare myself to my big sister of 13 months, who has already finished her Bachelor's, and is closing in on completing her Master's in some form of Chemistry.  I know that ""comparison is the death of happiness,"" but I have never been able to shake this complex I have about at *least* matching my sister's accomplishments... which I have never succeeded in doing.  I know that she loves me, but I also know that she thinks of me as an embarrassment because she is a perfectionist.  My little sister, on the other hand, is awesome; she is 18 and a Freshman at my university.

* I feel as though my options are limited.  I think about dropping out every day, daydream about going home, locking myself in my room and OD'ing on my heart medication so that no one will ever have to feel obligated to take care of me.  I feel *relieved* thinking about it.  I've *never* been this way *in my entire life,* but I find myself crying through a lot of my classes now.  I'm 23, and I've completed nothing worthwhile in my life; I'm consumed with shame and self-hatred.  I'm the girl who gets picked last to play any team sport; I like to read, and I used to love art, before I started squashing my own creative nature to be more streamline and ""mature.""

* My DREAM is to be a writer, or a model... but my family's wish for me is to get my degree, now.  However, I know that I will kill myself before I struggle through another year-and-a-half here, and we (bf and I) don't have the money or resources to pack up and move elsewhere to essentially ""start over.""

What do I do, Reddit?  How could I ever possibly justify dropping out of college, when my parents emotionally/financially support me every step of the way and I keep failing them?  I feel pathetic, and I don't want to be the girl working as a check-out lady at the Dollar Store when I'm 50.  I have not done a lot of irrational things in my life, but a big part of me wants to join a hippie commune--anything to help me depressurize and regain my composure in the world--but I don't even know where to begin researching.  I have had a few friends do this, but they were not close friends, and I have lost touch with them.  

If anyone has felt so hopelessly lost, please, what do I do to get past this?  How do I make myself better?  I am desperate, and I feel like it's already too late.

We were seeking financial aid through the state, but because she is self employed (as a hairdresser) we were unable to get into the emergency relief program. We went from our house with a meager carload of items and rented a room in a local motel for 2 weeks (which was in fact our only option. it was about $30-$40 a night though, so in hind sight not the best idea). After this, when funds pretty much ran out, my mother heard the one of her friends could let us stay with her for a while. We went there and stayed in her 2 bedroom apartment, cat, dog, fish, and all, for about 3 weeks. Then, the lovely landlord said it was a violation of the lease to have ""overnight or long term guests"" (which was bullshit but we didn't want to cause an issue) and basically told us to leave or everyone would be kicked out. So, here we are, back again at a motel for the next few days. My mother found this condo/apartment that is great, but it is much to expensive for us ($850 a month, water and lawn services included). There is also another option of moving into a mobile home which would be much cheaper (around $350 a month, water and lawn included) but I can't seem to sway her from trying to dive into the apartment/condo thing. She wants so badly to live somewhere nice and spacious but right now I do not think it is doable. On top of everything else, school for me starts in 6 days. I know that the courses I are going to be very difficult in a regular situation, let alone living while lacking any structure whatsoever. I have no idea what to do anymore, and I can't just go out and get a job because I really have no way to get to and from work (I am 16 though, so I can legally work). We are running out of options. My mother is so stressed out at this point that she can't sleep, and if she ends up getting sick from her weakened immune system we are entirely screwed. Is there any advice out there for us? 



Edit: thanks so much already guys, and I just want to say that I am in no way opposed to living in the mobile home. If it means we can sleep somewhere on a regular basis and have a fridge then I'm all for it. The problem with that is my mother and swaying her want.

I am extremely depressed and hopeless, and need advice basically.

From the earliest time that I remember trying to interact with other human beings, I felt like an outsider.  

I told myself that all these other kids obviously had something I didn't - the ability to socialize naturally.  I felt that I needed to learn how to do this at all costs.  I set about doing it very scientifically.  It was frustrating and hopeless.  I never once ate lunch with the other kids in elementary school, same story for junior high, and high school.  I was terrified to ask anyone to eat together.  I actually still feel nervous about eating with others to this day.  I was afraid to be alone with anyone - I felt that I had no idea how to act when alone with others, because I had never observed two people alone before.  I felt like the protocol MUST be different.  I remember hating being alone with my own parents.   I pretended to have friends in front of my parents.  I'd make up stories to tell them about the things I did with my non-existent friends to make it more believable.  I KNEW that I couldn't tell them about what I was going through.  

I never told anyone that I struggled like this, not even my parents, because I told myself that if I were to reveal to the ""normals"" that I was trying to fake it in their world, they would never be able to accept me as one of them.  I would ruin the magic.  I would only be able to magically socialize with others if I was able to figure out how to socialize among them alone, on my own, just like they did.  

I'm now 23.  In my first 2 years of college I was able to socialize quite well.  I blame this partly on a delusion I had set up for myself that gave me extreme confidence.  Eventually, this all fell apart, and I still realized I was having problems, and I eventually devolved into a full psychotic break - that lasted 8 months untreated (my family is religious and doesn't believe in psychology).  I completely withdrew from all human beings save my mom, dad, and sister.  I hallucinated rampantly, thought ever more frequently (and elaborately) in delusions, and generally felt pretty trapped.  

I'm finally being treated by a psychiatrist.  I couldn't do it on my own, honestly...I was still too afraid to admit to the ""normal"" world that I wasn't like them.  The only reason I ended up seeing my first psychiatrist was because my university forced me to (...the result of some behavior on my part that seemed less than sane to them).  They told me I had to either see a psychiatrist, or I would be placed on suspension.  Schizophrenia runs in my family (grandma had it...I believe my mom has it, but she won't see care because God forbids it, she believes).  Her belief didn't stop her from attempting suicide twice, believing my brother was attempting to kill her, and spreading scribbled notes about how God had forsaken her all around the house.  

I'm finally ready to admit what I'm going through to others, as terrifying as it is to do so.  It greatly pains me that schizophrenia is an ailment that in and of itself can prevent its sufferers from getting help.  If I ever get out of this with my brain, I'm going into neuroscience.  I already spent a year and a half at UC Berkeley for Cognitive Science, but unfortunately I only passed one of three of those semesters, for it was during my time here at Berkeley that my psychotic break occurred.  

I'm taking time off now, trying to get myself straightened out before trying to go back.  Thanks for reading this.  Not sure why I posted it.  I sort of do.  Today, I was interacting with some people I have managed to befriend around here, but who I suddenly was not able to feel connected with today, with whom suddenly today in particular I was not able to socialize.  I'm scared, and unsure of why I am having this sudden flash back to a much, much worse time in my life.  But I have hope for the future.  And I wanted to share this with you, because it is a memory of something that really helped me consider, for the first time, that there was possibly another way, that maybe I had been thinking about things all wrong all my life as far as socialization goes, and my future.

Legally, I'm an adult as of six months ago, so I can GTFO without being scared of her coming after me. This was all sever emotional/verbal abuse, so I couldn't tell anyone when I was legally a child and should have gotten taken away from her. No-one would have believed me, and you can't prove emotional abuse unless you catch it in the act.

I work full time, but it's minimum wage, and I've hardly been able to save anything since I'm supporting the both of us. I dropped out of high school a while ago, but I'm hoping I can finish it online and go to university somehow. Before I dropped out my avg was 88%, and I've only got about half of gr 12 left. I feel like I have potential to be more than the Derp's Burgers employee that I currently am, but I'll never be able to realize that potential if I stay with my mother.

Realistically, I need to move at least a city or two over, or even go to the next province (I'm in Canada). She knows where I work, so if I just moved out and stayed at my current job she'd have a real easy time hunting me down. The last thing I want is some sort of confrontation with her.

I can't drive and don't have a vehicle. I don't have any friends or family that would be able to help me out. My mother made sure we were completely estranged from everyone. The only people I have regular contact with besides her are my co-workers. I have $660 in savings and no particular job skills.

How on earth can I make this work? I'm so scared that I'll just end up homeless (again) and in a worse situation than I am now.

I've been trying to save up my money secretly, to get a van to live in when I run. My plan was to get her to teach me to drive.

Exceptions to this are mortgages, car loans and student loans.  If at all possible pay cash.  Granted, the occasional credit card and revolving credit line help your FICO score, but taking 10 years to pay off $4000 at 23% is never good practice.

* Before you ever try to make someone else happy, make **yourself** happy.
 
* If you are 23, making 8 dollars an hour and living in a shitty apartment with another 23 year old who is making 8 dollars an hour, you are doing something wrong.
 
* You have one shot with your body, treat it well.  When you get old and your knees don't work anymore, there is not much which can be done.  
 
* No matter your relationship with your family (specifically your parents), make peace.  One day they will be gone forever, and there is nothing worse than things unsaid.
 
* Stop using LOL if you are over the age of 18.  It is so incredibly worn out, and by using it in any form you immediately remove any credibility from your statement.  I see countless 40-year-olds who drop it multiple times a day and it is about as uncomfortable as a movie sex scene with your parents in the room.
 
* Always take the perspective of other people into account before you open your big fat mouth.  Not everyone is in the same frame of mind as you.
 
* That being said, spend the first 60 seconds of a conversation with your mouth closed and your ears open.  It will almost always make a difference on what you say and improve how other people view you.  You have **one** mouth and **two** ears for a reason.
 
* Even if you are a total nerd and love farting around on the computer, try to spend at least a couple hours outside in the sun.  I regret spending so much time on my career and my paycheck to the point where my personal life suffered.

I need to get some things off my chest. Let me preface this by saying that it's 8.pm, I'm sitting in my dorm room with a carton of milk that I just purchased in front of me and I'm crying. All I want to do is to walk out the door and head to the kitchen opposite my door and put the milk inside the refridgerator, but I can't. I hear people outside. 

Nobody on my floor knows that my room is currently occupied (if they do, they haven't seen me) and I've been living here for a little over a month. I basically wake up really early (3-4 am) so that I can sneak out to take a shower or go to the bathroom or take out the trash without meeting anyone. I purchased the carton of milk in hopes that I would have the nerve to enter the kitchen ... I was feeling positive this afternoon.

Sadly, I thought I had this behind me. I've recently lost over 100 pounds after near life-long obesity and really had high hopes that this would change things. To a degree things did start to slowly turn around but unfortunately faced with my new living situation it's all coming back. I've started to bing again (although nowhere near as bad as before) and I'm locking myself in again.

Now at this point you may be thinking that I'm unemployed, never see people and have no friends. Ironically this isn't the case. I have a job that I like and for the most part I function farely well there. As long as social situation are work related I feel fairly comfortable. I have a few friends as well. But I've never talked to them about personal things. Why? Well for one, I'm simply never talked about personal things, so I have no idea how to approach the situation other than to deflect it with humor. These situations don't come up very often. I really haven't the slightest clue if it's because of my behavior or because they simply don't like me that much. From an intellectual standpoint I assume it's the former, emotionally I assume it's the latter. 

I have a shit relationship with my parents. My father was an alcoholic and my mother made the mistake of using my fear of him to blackmail me, although I know she didn't realize the harm she was doing. I know my mother loves me, but somehow I can't get myself to love her back even though I know I should. 

The problem is that I don't really know how to gage others. When I do meet others I get along really well. Unfortunately deep friendships never seem to evolve. I do everything for others: I listen, I'm understanding, funny and generous. However this never seems to lead to a deep friendship (dare I mention a relationship) that I really want. I always seem to be second choice (if not farther down the heirarchy). 

I would love to think that I understand my situation. Sometimes I think it's all my fault, sometimes a completely blame others and virtually in between. But to be honest, I completely clueless. 

Well, I could go go on for hours and as you can probably judge by the lack of structure and poor phrasing, I'm all over the place and going on won't lead to more clarity. 

If you've made it this far, I thank you for listening (... or reading). 


**update**: I would like to thank each and every one of you who posted here from the bottom of my heart. I have to admit that the night I posted this I was feeling too down to leave my room. But I woke up to great comments which got me thinking and lifted my spirit. I happy to say that I mustered the courage to leave my room and put my milk (which I repurchased after drinking last night ... just to provide incentive to try it again). It didn't go that smoothly. It took me a little over an hour and my heart was pounding. There was a girl in the kitchen who was alone and smoking. I managed to let out a quiet ""hello"" after which I awkwardly put my milk in the fridge and proceeded to boil some water so I could make a cup of joe. While the water was warming she thankfully asked me if I just moved in this week. I lied and said yes. I didn't want to seem too awkward. She asked me what I studied and thankfully that gave me an opportunity to say something  (in the sense of knowing what to say). I told her what I was doing. Then I even managed to ask what she was doing and a short conversation evolved.

1285993792.0,22,self.needadvice,dlsmy,"Reddit, I need help. I have a stalker who was once a father figure to me.",23,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/dlsmy/reddit_i_need_help_i_have_a_stalker_who_was_once/,"Hello, Reddit! I've been a lurker for a few months now (no account, just browsing around), but just signed up to ask for advice on this situation that I am in. Reddit is full of so many wonderful people, and I know I can get help from this community.

Now, to my situation - it's rather long. A few years back, when I was a sophomore in high school, I joined a local youth orchestra to play trumpet. I hadn't ever taken lessons and I was pretty horrible. During one rehearsal, the president of the youth symphony approached me and asked if I would like to learn the french horn - and if so, he would give me a free lesson. I obliged, as I was interested in the instrument, and went to my first free lesson. After my first lesson, he asked if I was interested in continuing to play the horn. I replied that I was, and continued to take free lessons from him, once a week. 
He was a very generous man who always took his free time to help me with not only my horn, but also my social anxieties, future hopes and fears, life inquiries… whatever I needed help with. Throughout my sophomore and junior year of high school he was like a father to me, and taught me everything I know on the horn.
I decided I was going to major in music as a junior. Because of this, I spent a lot more time with him. Near the end of my Junior year, things began to get strange.
He started writing me poetry, love notes, bringing gifts to every lesson (once or twice a week). At first, I accredited it to the fact that he was like a father to me. But then it just hit me how un-father-like the situation was.
While I was at a music camp, he came and visited (drove an 8 hour car drive to see me). My mother was also up there. She suggested we (all 3 of us) go out to eat. He took me out hiking, against her wishes. Later, pissed, my mother confronted him about it. He simply told her that he was in love with me, and that he couldn't help if he wanted some alone time with me. By the way, this is a 50+ year old man, and I was just a 17 year old girl at the time. My mother, flabbergasted, dropped the situation and never confronted him again.
When I started to complain to my mother about the situation - how uncomfortable it made me feel - she awkwardly avoided the topic by making fun of it (""Ohhh, you're just making an old man happy! *wink wink*""). She has never been good at talking about important, deep topics, and always turns to perverted jokes to lessen the awkward tension. She's a character.
Just a few bad encounters/occurrences: once, he bought me a bikini and made me try it on in front of him (""So I can see if it fits!""). I profusely refused, but he tried to turn it around psychologically and make it seem like there shouldn't be anything wrong with that. It was terrifying. I was shaking with fear and anger. It was obvious that it wasn't just to see if it fit. Another time, he spent an entire lesson telling me how much he loved me with poetry and how he constantly ""felt my presence"". It was extremely awkward and made me feel very scared. Every lesson he asks for hugs. Scary, long, back groping hugs that last for literally minutes (which seem like  lifetimes). They actually makes me die on the inside every time. I finally started to make excuses to refuse, but it's hard when I used to see him as a father figure. These are just a few TINY incidents/occurrences of THOUSANDS that I can immediately think of. Some are worse.
When I went to a music festival this summer (six weeks long), he sent packages/letters once a week, called at least three times a day, and actually drove to visit me (a 15+ hour drive).
Now, I am a freshman at an accomplished music conservatory. I'm proud that I made it here, but I also feel that I owe it completely to him that I am here. I think he knows this, and is using this against me to guilt me into keeping in close contact. The first few weeks of school, he called 8 times daily, texted CONSTANTLY throughout the day, and has sent me mail/packages/gifts consistently.
I am so confused, so angry, so fearful. I just don't know what to do. He does not get that I don't want to stay close, but it's too hard for me to tell him straight up as he used to mean something to me. He was like a father to me, and suddenly crossed borders that shouldn't have been crossed. Now he is an obsessive stalker, but because I was once close to him it's very hard for me to cut him off and be mean to drive the point home that I do not want this attention.
My mother tries to help, but it's just very difficult for her. She tries to confront him now, but he will NOT listen to her. My boyfriend just gets infuriated thinking about him, so his advice is rather… violent (bahaha, just kidding). Reddit, can you give me any advice? ANY advice would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR - My horn teacher, who taught me everything I know and got me into an accomplished music school was once a father to me. Now he's crossed borders he shouldn't have crossed and says he's deeply in love with me. He's 50+ and I am an 18 year old girl. Now he is an obsessive stalker and I am confused as to what I should do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

This is the last straw as far as my mother is concerned, she can't sit by and watch him be addicted to something that is sending him into debt. She has finally said that he has to move out instead of paying her subsidised rent or live with all the sites being blocked and having to show her his statement each month if he wants to live at home.   
(It's similar to watching a family member spend hundreds on gambling or alchohol, you can't just sit by)

My brother has convinced himself that it's a case of my mother being overprotective and that she doesn't want him to have a girl and cannot see that these girls don't care about him, one married another man and he still thought she was in love with him. She lied about being in a car crash, having brain damage and being ill.

I am 19 year old Asian American male going to college on the west coast.  Born in America, grew up in Japan going to an international school.

Is it just me or do Asian American males have it really rough here in the United States?


People always assume random things about me.  One time, I studied really hard for the final, since I was failing the class and needed an A or higher on the final to pass.  I ended up getting the A.  One of my classmates saw my score, and was like ""that's expected, you're Asian, you probably didn't even need to work hard"", which made me kinda pissed off since I had actually put a lot of work into it.


I was hanging out with another Asian American female friend and she told me that she thought Asian guys were ""wimpy and probably all losers/nerds.""  This really surprised me, since she was basically stereotyping her own race.  Sadly enough, she is not the only Asian (American) I have heard that from.



In society it seems that Asian American males are eternally treated as the ""Beta male"" no matter what they are really like.  This seems true in movies as well.  The Asian male characters all have really negative stereotypical portrayals.  I went to see the Hangover Part II with some friends from school (I hadn't seen Hangover Part I).  They all thought it was hilarious.  I thought it was horrible and wanted to punch something every time Ken Jeong's character was on screen.


I thought the United States was supposed to be the epitome of freedom and equality for people of any race or color.  The other day, one of my classmates send me an email (we were working on a project together) with all the L's replaced by R's.  Not only was it hard to read, I found it incredibly rude.


Does anyone have any tips for dealing with these type of issues?  Am I just imagining things or does life really suck for Asian males in the US?",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_1gi8jv,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1gi8jv/is_it_just_me_or_do_asian_american_males_have_it/,

I work with a lot of customers every day, and not one has ever complained about my hair. Many people like talking to me about it and compliment me on it, and children like to ask me about it. I have a lot of fun with this, and I enjoy it. 

The piercings are not a huge issue to me. I would love to keep them, but I understand that, because I technically work with food, that it's not outrageous that they are asking this of me. I need the job, so if I have to change to keep my paychecks, that's just how it is, and I will do it.

Why?",21,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/18txth/i_feel_bored_with_my_life_despite_making_a_lot_of/,"I’m a 25 year old guy and 2012 was transitional for me.  This time last year, I thought, “who do I want to be?”  and I became him.

I got a full-time job, drastically improved my appearance (weight loss/fashion sense), moved to a fun brand new city where I have made friends and dated girls.  I even make my own music and a local label showed interest and picked me up.  I picked up several new hobbies and even began volunteering with an animal shelter.  

Despite all this, I’m so *bored*.  

And not the outward kind of bored, like “nothing to do today”, but inward kind of bored, like “Ok, I became who I wanted to be.  Now what?”  All these changes were fun for a while, and moving to a city of 1.5 million people was amazing, but like anything else it all wore off and became “normal”.  Now I’m just kind of living life, going day-to-day, feeling a little numb.

I don’t know if it’s the weather/time of year, or if it’s the monotonous 9-5 job, or if it’s just me being naturally discontent, but I’m not sure which direction to go in.  It’s like I got all my shit together and now I feel like there aren’t a lot of challenges.

Anybody been there?  And just to be clear, I have made friends and have no trouble making new ones.  I am extremely extroverted.  I’m just saying this to avoid any advice like “join a club”, because meeting people/forming friendships isn’t my problem.

1360727112.0,20,self.needadvice,18f99k,One of my housemates cockblocks my friendships and I don't know why. ,21,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/18f99k/one_of_my_housemates_cockblocks_my_friendships/,"So, some back story. I live in a co-op. I've been there for 5 years. There's no theme to our co-op or anything, we're just in communal living for the cheap rent, but there are a couple other ""bike-centric"" co-ops that are made of people who have been friends of people who live in our house for a long time. 

I am an introvert. I take time to get to know people and due to some crap that happened in the past, I almost never invite myself into social situations. As a kid/young person, open invitations would often be presented to groups of friends i thought I was a part of, and then when I accepted, the offeror would get mad that I ""invited"" myself along, so I am pretty sure something is wrong with me and I don't ""get"" group dynamic stuff. So, when I want to do something that has a group invite, I always always double check to ensure that I'm invited and I never ever assume i'm included, even if a group invite is presented to a group that I'm a part of. (Ie- someone comes into the kitchen and says ""Anyone want to go see a movie?"" If I want to go, I""ll specifically ask ""Can I go with you?"" or some variation there of to clarify.)  This has usually not been a problem as I have, despite my introverted tendancies, managed to forge some pretty decent friendships in the time i've been here and as far back as recent memory in this context at this house and with this group of friends, the answer has always been ""of course you're invited, I asked the group!"".

Despite being a weirdo introvert, I do have several close friends in the house and generally have no problem with one on one interactions.

I had a friend that I knew through other friends. We'd go to the same shows, go on the same mass bike rides and generally were amicable to eachother but not specifically close friends. She wanted to move into our co-op at a time when we needed someone to replace a deadbeat really quickly, and so i vouched for her and she ended up moving in. 

She is substantially younger than me (early 20's to my late 20's)and very, very serious about being in some bike/crafting/workshop clicks that other people who I know/am friends with are also in, but don't take as seriously. Since she's moved in, she's been really dismissive of me. It's been a year now, and it's like she's actively trying to keep me out of social groups. Mutual friends will come over, and they will go to her room to watch TV shows or hang out. If I knock and ask if I can come in, she says things like... ""well, there isn't really room for one more person..."" or something like that, but then other mutual friends try to invite me in and then I feel weird and she acts more and more dismissive of me the more she sees other people pursuing friendships with me who are also her friends. 

I have tried to be extra nice to her, lending her things (which she never returns or thanks me for but it's just little stuff that's not a big deal anyway to me so I can't complain too much), being supportive when she has problems, etc. 

She is very, very outgoing and I am not at all, so there's no way that I could ever be better liked by her friends than she is, and I don't want to be included all the time, just once in a while. But when other friends invite me to go places with them, she will do things like ensure they leave without me or that there is no room for me to come along. If i try to talk to her (nothing super serious, just like ""hi"" or ""excuse me"" or normal roommate stuff like ""have you seen the cat today?""), she'll ignore what I say and turn her back to me. 

She's gotten so good at discreetly making sure that i get left out that other mutual friends think I don't want to be THEIR friends anymore either, because she's so good at keeping me away from the group as a whole. The group is very... group oriented and there isn't a whole lot of hanging out one on one until people are good friends, but I can't get to that good friends point because i've been cut out of the group. 

And also, she always has drama with people, and I can never tell who she has drama with and who she dosen't. No one ever really has drama with me usually (this is a weirdo rare case) so I just talk to everyone who wants to talk to me and accept most invitations to hang out. Only, recently, i've accepted invitations to hang out with people she's on the outs with for whatever reason, and she's now telling people that i'm ""taking their side"". I'm not taking any sides. I just don't have drama with anyone (except her, I guess?) 

I don't want people I like and want to be better friends with to think that i'm always ditching them/uninterested in hanging out just because ONE PERSON is making sure I have no access to the group or group activities, but she's really outspoken and outgoing and I can't compete with her, she's a total queen bee and drives the group without them realizing it. She also hasn't done anything specifically mean to me that I could call her out on, she's just really passive aggressive. 

(last time we had a house party, a mutual friend had made a lot of special homebrew beer. She had told the entire household at a house meeting that she had ""10 gallons of so-n-so's homebrew just for housemates to share with their best friends in her room and if we wanted any, to come up to her room and get it during the party"" During the party, i took ONE of my close friends that she didn't know (but other people in the house did) into her room to try the beer because he also homebrews and was really excited about it, and getting to talk to the brewer that made it. She flipped out, told me I was ""disrespecting her space"" by bringing in ""strangers"" and that she felt like i was totally disrespectful, even though the room had about 20 people in it at the time, some of which were people her friends had brought in that she didn't know.) 

I""m at my wit's end and freaking out over it. I do not know how to solve this because she's arranged it so that if i bring anything up, it looks like i'm starting shit with her, and she's made it clear she has the power to keep me away from mutual friends in social situations. I'm super bummed and have no idea what I did. I don't even hate this girl. I just want us to be cool and be able to share friends without it being a big drama thing. Help.

Seriously. 

I'm not even sure I'm posting this in the right reddit, but I don't know where else to put it and the only reason I'm writing this in the first place is because my sister has been begging me to ask reddit for suggestions concerning my problems because she constantly uses reddit as a support network.

This is also my last resort. I've been fighting for five years with this hell I'm in and I'm finally at a point where I might stop fighting all together. A part of me doesn't want that to happen and it's the part of me writing this right now. The rest of me is waiting to throw in the towel. I don't mean suicide, but just accepting that my life is never going to get better and that I'll have to live the rest of my life like....this.

Firstly, just know this. My childhood and most of my teenage years could be considered perfect. Nothing horrible has ever happened to me (thus how could I possibly be in a hell that's making death sound appealing). My parents have been married for 26 years, never been happier, they had six kids, myself being the youngest and to make matters sound even more perfect, my father treats me like a princess, my mother is seriously the coolest mom ever and my five siblings? They sometimes fight over who gets to hang out with me (not exaggerating, they've actually argued right in front of me)

Yeah...

What the hell am I on here for...

I usually start my story in Junior year of high school, but I'm starting to wonder if it all didn't start earlier, when I was in 7th grade. I went to a very small catholic school (small as in there were 8 kids in my whole class) and being that I was young and friends with my entire class, sometimes we were hard pressed to come up with things to entertain us, so I started writing fiction for them to read. I had no idea it would explode into a ten year obsession that I would continue to write even to this day. I created and molded this fantasy world, characters that I would find weeks, months, years worth of entertainment from just by developing their personalities, their histories, their hardships and relationships with one another. Ten years of hundreds of short stories and countless sketchbooks. When my school closed down, lost all my friends, attended a posh, private school where I was alone for five years and couldn't make any new friends, these stories kept me sane (I heard my sister say once that when that small school closed, I was never the same). I was always terrible at school even in elementary, a D student and surrounded by people that excelled and had careers in mind, where as I had no clue what I wanted to be (still don't and I'm 21). I was constantly getting yelled at by catholic school teachers for being incompetent, stupid and worthless, which is why I think I started writing in the first place. No one could yell at me for writing fiction, criticize it, say it was wrong or mark it up in red. It was mine and no one could do anything about it if it made me happy. Like I said, in the midst of the chaos of high school and college, they helped keep my sanity in check.

And even in Junior year, when the panic attacks started, the depression came on and the medications began, I could still find solace in my stories. Even if I felt hopeless or unbearably sad, it was always a comfort to know that no matter how hard life got, I would always have those stories to light that spark of happiness in my heart. They had never failed me before and I was sure they never would. And even when I had to put them on the shelf for a few years while I dealt with college (the only horror story of my life really), I could always pick them up again and laugh and smile at the documents littered all over my hard drive.

As for college, that's when the anxiety skyrocketed to new heights and the hypochondria started. Stories aside, for two years I didn't have time to write when college came around because I had so much new shit to deal with. At the college orientation, I went into one of the worst panic attacks of my life (like, thinking your life is OVER) and then another one of the same magnitude the day of move-in. To boot, for the next two semesters, I was nauseous 24/7, went to the nurse at least twice a week worried I was suffering from some horrible illness and three times ended up in the ER because I thought I was dying. Every ache and pain then became a death sentence and I was miserable the ENTIRE time I spent away at college. I dropped out after only one year (wasted thousands of dollars just to be sick and miserable for ten months) and came home to attend the community college with my brother, which was much more bearable and pleasant. That year I finally felt like I was recovering from my depression and anxiety and then last summer landed a job that I ended up loving and making a few friends at. Life finally started to be getting better. I was writing again too, how could life have gotten any worse again?

Well somehow it did... and not only did it start to suck again, it got worse and worse and worse than ever before. Somehow in the eight months since this all started, I have experienced hell a thousand times over.
And it started with a root canal retreatment.

Everyone has been trying to convince me that my mental torment and that procedure are in no way related, but I can't accept that. My hypochondria won't let me think otherwise, because the day after I had a root canal tooth retreated, I was assaulted with this overwhelming dizziness that continued for two weeks until I had enough and went to the ER again where they said I had BPV (Benign Positional Vertigo). They gave me medication that didn't work and instead I went to an ENT who also assured me that a root canal couldn't make me constantly dizzy. This was back in March and since then my depression returned, my hypochondria started going haywire, I STILL have on-going depersonalization where before it was just episodic and the dizziness has never gone away. The depression however, has warped and taken on a form I've never felt before.

At first, back in May through about August (I got fired in this time too, so I've been unemployed for three months now), I was feeling emotionally blunted, like I just couldn't get that spark of emotion anymore. I could cry or laugh sincerely, but it's like I didn't feel it in my heart... I was sure it would pass, but then in September I went through a month long existential crisis, where I thought I was losing my mind, I thought I was going to end up in an insane asylum because I just didn't feel like me with the emotional numbness and I fought so hard to try to feel anything, to MAKE myself feel SOMETHING... All while the hypochondria was convinced that this was happening because something was atrophying my brain, making it deteriorate because there's no other way I would go back to my stories and feel NOTHING. No happiness. No spark. Not even any interest.
I have ALWAYS used them to comfort myself and when it doesn't work for the first time in ten years, you kind of freak out. But you can't even freak out because of how apathetic you've become due to the depression due to something you're sure is biological, for how could it possibly be psychological? I didn't want to feel nothing, to feel empty and hollow, so it has to be something physical or physiological, right?

In October it only got worse... I started to come to terms with the fact that my emotions were gone and I was never getting them back because I'm sure my brain is sick somehow. There's no other way I would toss aside my stories like this. And because my family and doctors know I'm a hypochondriac, help only comes with an eye roll or a dismissal and so I've truly reached my wit's end. Everyday is an empty existence and I'm afraid of falling into what my mom said she went through once with her PPD: despair. Not eating. Not sleeping. Not bathing or functioning. Hardly even moving and wasting away because I can't figure out how to care anymore, I can't figure out how to make this dizziness and depersonalization go away and most of all I can't figure out who I am anymore. Whoever I've become, I don't know her and I feel like I'm living through this shell I have no connection with. She has an empty laugh and a fake smile and even though this should all make me sad and even more depressed, I don't because there are no emotions left in me to do so. 

Once I would have cried writing out this story, I now only sit and stare blankly at the screen. 
...What's wrong with me?

TL;DR: Writing made me happy for many years, depression came back and made me emotionally numb. Can't care about life anymore. Help.",,False,,t5_2r367,1352571201.0,,,True,t3_12ypcg,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/12ypcg/last_cry_for_help/,

She is usually content and even happy, but often gets very angry with me over what seems to me to be minor things. For example, a potential job provider asked if she had a certain skill and I said she was learning it in school, rather then saying that she knew it. She blew up at me, refused to speak with me, and slept in the living room that night. It was only the next day when she finally let me talk to her and accepted that it was really no big deal. Twice previously, she has gotten so upset with me that she has taken our 2yo daughter and simply gone out into the streets, with literally nowhere to go.

I know I'm not blameless in this. I haven't always treated as well as I should, and she has been under a lot of stress from many different sources. But on Saturday she stood in front of me and shoved a handful of pills into her mouth. My immediate reaction was to call 911. When I did, she spit them out, but by then it was too late. The cops showed up, and just a few hours later she was Baker Acted at the hospital (she went voluntarily, but apparently that means absolutely nothing). If it had just been that, she might have been released, but she had told me many times before, when angry, that she wanted to be dead, so I said the same to the nurses. I really think she only ever said it to get to me, though, so if I had known what would happen next I probably would have kept silent.

I'm now learning about the Baker Act (Florida only), and fuck that's a shitty piece of legislation (in short, anyone deemed to be a potential threat to themselves or others can be involuntary detained, drugged, tested, etc... for up to 72 hours). My wife now has no privacy, and is subject to humiliating tests and cold showers. As soon as she was moved she was given a hospital shift right off the back of another patient. My wife tells me she is starving, but the food is so horrible and flavorless that she just can't bring herself to eat it. When she asks for something else, the nurses completely ignore her and treat her like she's crazy. Everything she had on her was taken, so she has nothing to do to stay occupied. I'm not allowed to take anything to her, and she's not even allowed to see our daughter. And finally, a weekend stay apparently doesn't count towards the 72 hours, because she has to wait for a psychiatrist and a second opinion.

I don't even know what advice I'm asking for here. At most, my wife may need some anger management counseling, but she doesn't belong in a psych ward. It can only be making things worse for her. We love each other and our daughter, so I want nothing more than to figure out how to fix our relationship, assuming it survives this. It's difficult because my wife is completely closed to marriage counseling, calling it a waste of money. For now, though, I just want to get her out of there. But as far as I know, there is nothing I can do. It's as if she is a prisoner, yet as far as I know, she has commited no crime.

tl;dr My wife went a little too far to get my attention and was committed to a psychiatric ward.

UPDATE: My wife was released to me this afternoon. She is fine, but definitely depressed. I'm going home from work to see her now, but I wanted to thank everyone for the kind words and suggestions. People brought up some good points so, if I can, I will try to respond to a few people later.",,False,,t5_2r367,True,,,True,t3_tayqj,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/tayqj/my_wife_was_baker_acted_on_saturday/,

Throughout highschool and till this day, I never had what seems to be the norm between my peers here. I never had summer flings, wasn't very popular in school(I don't really care much for this tho), didn't date. I've never been in a relationship, nor had any one night flings or anything like that. Now I understand most of you would say this is entirely my fault, which it is, and I'm doing my best to change that. I've improved my physique, and doing everything I possibly can to better myself as a person. Even through all that, I feel like I've missed out on such a diverse part of my adolescence, something I feel I can't get back and thinking about it just kills me. But being an only child has always pushed that lone wolf attitude in me, and looking at my friends really makes me question whether I would ever be able to attain the same types of relationships they have, they same connection. **Friends have told me, ""Oh well you're better off that you didn't go through what I have"", but to be honest, I'm not, I want to experience those failures, I want to experience those heartbreaks and emotions, because right now, I just feel empty. And I start to obsess over things like working out, being super athletic/in shape, people ask why, I usually say because I was an obese kid, but in fact, its me trying desperately to fill a void.** tldr; I'm a QQ-ing emo kid.

I find that I can be terribly outspoken, but only with certain groups, and by certain groups i mean like groups of 4 or 5. I'm always the kid who kind of gets left behind, or forgotten about, even if i give up a lot for a friend. I want to believe that its just because I have only ended up running into the wrong types of people, but I find it hard to believe that when it's been like my entire life. 

   I've tried following things that I've heard from here; faking it till I make it, being open to people. But no one ever fucking reciprocates, and that really frustrates me and angers me. And I have a problem connecting with most people at my college, because all they do is talk about sports or just won't open up their circle for me. I have virtually no friends, let alone people I want to hang out with in my dorm area. 




As for the second part, which probably ties in with why I can't make friends, is that people don't take me seriously. I'm pretty sure it's because I'm always a bit of a nervous speaker, and a lot of times, I won't be able to express what I want to say. I have some weird habits, like practicing some dance moves while bored. Where do I mark the line so people will just think of me as outrageous, and not someone they can just treat like trash, or laugh at?

As a single person, I'm expected to buy gifts for everyone individually, but in exchange, I get one present from that ""family"".  For example, I buy a gift for each of my brother, sister-in-law and nephew, but in return I get one present from ""Dave, Julie and Bradley"".  Same thing for birthdays, we celebrate each of theirs and I get them each a present, but in return I get one from their family on my birthday.

I don't really begrudge the giving and receiving of gifts, it just seems a little unfair.  I'm on a bit of a budget and it's hard to buy for everyone without being cheap sometimes.  It's also a little depressing to always be the first one to run out of presents every year, my family always does an orderly ""everyone opens one at a time and we all sit and admire each gift"" Christmas.  I also buy one each for my sister-in-law's parents since they always celebrate with us - she's an only child - and get one in return. This also goes for my two sisters and their husbands.

I tried bringing this up calmly and maturely at Christmas one year, but it went over badly.  I also tried buying a family gift for them the next year (Like a DVD set they would all like) and was told my nephew was sad he didn't get his own special gift (and heard through the grapevine my SIL was unhappy too.)  *edit* Obviously I don't expect the nephew to buy me a gift, btw, the issue is really with the adults, and I was probably wrong not to try to do one for the parents, and one for the child.

Fast forward to five hours later.  I get a call on my phone from his number.  I answer it and, instead of it being him, I get a sheriff's deputy telling me they have my son.

They caught him, his friend and two other kids in an abandoned house smoking weed.  My son's friend drove him to the house, supplied the drugs and, when the cops came, the kid ran leaving my son holding the bag, so to speak.

Eventually, they rounded him up and brought him back but since they didn't catch him on the property with the weed, they couldn't arrest him.  While my 16 year old son (who's never been in any trouble before) was in handcuffs, this asshole stood staring at son not admitting to anything.

My son did a stupid thing and we were lucky they only gave him a citation.  They did not arrest him or cart him off to juvenile detention.  We have to appear in court in a month and he could get a fine or community service.

The vast majority of the time there is either no profile or it is private, but every so often you stumble onto someone's world of grief or shock or their last posting.

Being bored at the moment (okay, putting off things on my to-do list) I looked up the name from a local-ish article. The things I saw he had written as captions on his photos were vile, vitriolic things and likely highly relevant to his crime / state of mind (he's been ordered to undergo a psychiatric assessment).

I'm now feeling a bizarre sense of duty in that I feel I need to share these with someone to alert them to his views but I know it's absolutely not my place to do anything of the sort. I'm sure that in this age of employers looking up potential employees and our information being so freely accessible then someone in 'the system' will have thought to do it, but I can't help hoping they do. What does concern me, however, is how none of his 34 'Facebook friends' have commented or thought these postings might be a sign of a dangerous mind. Again though - perhaps I'm reading too much into them, or perhaps no-one thought it was their business. Heck, I could even have the wrong person - I'm only going on name, age, and locality.

I want to post a link to the news article and Facebook comments here, but am not sure if that is allowed? To summarise though, the chap attacked a passerby with an axe after deciding the victim was loitering near public toilets. Two of the photo captions are: [TRIGGER - homophobic sentiments and language] http://i.imgur.com/9IgXbMD.png [1] and http://i.imgur.com/w58lOGE.png [2] and several others are like this: http://i.imgur.com/N4TYrq8.png [3] referring to a '3000 year old supercomputer run by homosexuals that is controlling us all' [paraphrased]. The pictures I posted make me think he's incredibly homophobic, but the comments about us being controlled do strike me as indicative of a disorder perhaps.

I'm not sure what I'm seeking through posting this, perhaps advice (yeah, I already know not to be a nosey sod, thanks!) or perhaps just to get it out there and see other people's thoughts on whether the Facebook comments are relevant. I really don't know, but it's weighing on my mind.

I'm extremely guarded, especially when it comes to discussing, sharing, or otherwise indicating my feelings, so I just kind of blamed the lack of communication on being overwhelmed with work. He really didn't press any further, even though he made it obvious in his response that he didn't buy it. (""Alright, well, I have been thinking about you. I figured you were busy, but after this span of time without hearing from you at our usual pace, I wanted to check in. Gimme a call if you wanna talk."")

That he seemed to care so much really got to me, and I ended up turning it over in my head for a week before finally deciding to admit ""No. I'm not doing okay."" I was afraid of overwhelming/surprising him with everything, but he's listened to and talked with me about everything on three occasions thus far, and has been amazingly understanding and supportive throughout.

I feel so much better just from sharing all the things I've kept to myself for so long, but he's also an incredible empathizer, and I can tell that he truly cares about my problems and the things I've told him, and puts sincere effort into trying to help. But the thing is, even though I'm so glad to have a chance to talk about everything that's on my mind with someone who really cares for me, I know that there's nothing that he or anyone else can say to make me feel like my life is worth continuing, and so I can only hurt him by sharing everything but never seeming to want to take the advice or care about the insight that he works so hard to give.

I wasn't expecting to ever be able to open up to anyone, and I have so much more I want to say now, but I'm afraid to do so, because I respect him and value our friendship so much that I'd rather keep everything else to myself and deal with it alone than risk bothering or upsetting him, and messing up things between us at all.

Long story short, my mom has a bad relationship with my father, although they have been married ~30+ years. They don't communicate and they have fought throughout their relationship. Awhile ago my dad made a comment to me about my mom being protective over her phone. It made me suspicious about what she was doing. Also, she makes little attempts to diminish my father's good deeds to her, which also made me suspicious. She is visiting me right now in my studio apartment. I noticed she was texting (could tell with a millisecond glance at the screen) - I asked her what she was doing - and she said that she was reading an e-mail. I had a hunch she didn't lock her phone so I thought I would snoop. I woke up at 6 in the morning before her, checked her phone, and there are affectionate texts from an unidentifiable number from last night. The damning parts of the text ask the person to call her because she was alone (I was at work), low-level sexual suggestion from her, and the other person saying they want to spoon and touch her while she sleeps.

I love my dad so much - more than anyone else in the world. I feel I owe it to him to tell him. That said, this will hurt him and may break apart the family. Father is 70, mother is 59. What do I do!?!?!?!?!?

Skinny as a rail, always been that way. I've never ever put on weight since I've stopped growing, been hovering around 56-58 kilos since forever. 

I've never really eaten much. I could eat perhaps 2 big meals a day and a lot of snacks in between. Didn't seem to affect my weight all that much.

Lately, I've kind of stopped wanting to eat. Sure, I get a least one decent meal at work just purely out of habit and consideration for my coworkers (grumpy me isn't a cheery person by and large). 
But in the mornings, and when I get home from work/in the evenings, I kind of just don't... want't to go through the hassle of getting up, getting food, making food. 

Never had this joy-relationship with food other people seem to have. It's just nutrition, something you *have* to do to stay kicking. Not something I get anything from mentally, nor cherish doing. It's just another chore I have to put myself through, like laundry or changing the kittylitter. 

  So, suggestions? I know that to have an apetite you might want to eat at least *something* to kickstart it, but I can't seem to manage that. Perhaps how to change my attitude towards food, or some things that are so simple and quick they remove the chore-element to making and eating.  
And yes, I am on multivitamins, omega3's, iron, all that good stuff. I'm slightly anemic but other than that the docs can't seem to find anything wrong.

1359828844.0,19,self.needadvice,17rgc9,"Last night my mom and I had a huge fight, and she threatened to kill herself. I called the police, she spent the night in the hospital, and now she basically hates me. How should I proceed?",27,8,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/17rgc9/last_night_my_mom_and_i_had_a_huge_fight_and_she/,"Hi Reddit. Here's the basic gist of my situation. It’s gonna be a long one, so if you want to skip it I’d appreciate any advice about dealing with irrational people, or experiences you’ve had with irrational people/breakthrough moments with them.

I’m 23 and female, living away from home at college. I love my mom and she is a wonderful woman. That said, our fights are deadly, explosive situations, and they happen every time I come home. We can be getting along great and then suddenly we’re both screaming. It’s not normal and I want to be able to communicate with her, but through all my efforts and approaches I have not yet found this to be possible.

Conversing with my mother is like walking in a minefield. I find that she is very easily offended, short-tempered, and overly sensitive. If she thinks I said something the ""wrong way"", or misunderstands what I said, then she claims I hate her and that I have *always* treated her ""like shit"". When she says these things it is absolutely devastating to me. It not only makes me upset, hurt, and frustrated, but it is incredibly counter-productive in our communications with each other, and she has no clue of the damaging mind-fuckery she causes me.

I couldn’t even tell you how our fight started last night. I came home from college for a doctor’s appointment, have been feeling unwell, and was home resting. She came home from work and the next thing I know she is fighting with me. I ask her what I did wrong and why she feels that way and all she can say is “you treat me like shit, you’ve *always* treated me like shit”. Then I explain to her how her words make me feel and all she can do is try and convince me that she is hurting more, that I am the bad guy here. She is my mom so of course she is *fantastic* at pushing all the right buttons, and it’s as if she is making a conscious effort to simply cause me pain.

She is an instigator. I am not claiming to be a perfect person, but I really do put forth great effort to be rational, calm, and perceptive, asking her questions to better understand how she feels. But I feel there is absolutely no getting through to her. And I must admit, my patience runs out; I can’t deal with hearing all the hurtful things she says to me after a while, and it is frustrating that we are getting absolutely nowhere despite my best efforts. She is extremely dramatic, acting like an actress and coming up with really dramatic lines that honestly just sound ridiculous and silly to me. I can’t take her seriously and I can’t get through to her.  So after a while of trying my best, I end up screaming too. Not hurtful things like she’s saying to me, but just screaming that I’m trying to get through to her and she is hurting me so much with her words, to which she assures me that she is hurting more, and repeats all the awful things.

The repetition and circles make me want to hit my head against the wall out of frustration because I *really* am trying. It’s a terrible, terrible spiral.

So last night when the fight escalated to the point of both of us screaming and crying, she says: “I want to *die*. I want to *kill* myself.”

I am full-out panic mode now. I start going “Are you serious, oh my god, what do I do, we need help, this isn’t normal, I can’t do this,” etc. She is crying in such a way that suggests she may need medical attention. So I say that we need to calm down and that I’m going to go sit in my car for a while. I sit there, call my boyfriend, calm down a bit, then begin to feel guilty realizing that I left her alone after she said wants to kill herself. So I go back in.

More of the same, she’s still screaming and crying uncontrollably, I’m still scared. So I leave again, call the police and explain the situation. I tell the operator I will be waiting down the block from my house and that I want to talk to the police first. They come, I flag them down, I explain that I’m not trying to get her in trouble and that she is probably going to be upset that I called them. They assure me she won’t get in any sort of trouble. So they go in my house and talk to her. After a while I go in. They say they need to take her to the hospital to talk to a psychiatrist, and that they are obligated to do so when someone self-threatens. My mom isn’t kicking and screaming, but is clearly very unhappy. They take her away in an ambulance.

I call the hospital after a little while to talk to her. She is *beyond* angry, and it doesn’t help that there is no psychiatrist there til the next morning so they have to keep her. “How could you do this to me? I am so humiliated! They are keeping me prisoner! You *knew* I didn’t mean what I said! You did a terrible thing by calling the police!” She also told me things that were clearly just to scare me, like that this could threaten her career, and that she isn’t sure if they will *ever* release her (“I didn’t expect them to keep me overnight, so who knows!”) And the actress-dramatic line that she came up with: “Throwawaymom1451, I will forgive you for this.. *someday…………., but not today*.”  She repeated this several times throughout the conversation, sounding like she was trying her damnedest to win an Oscar. It creeps me out that she’s not self-aware enough to see how absurd she sounds when she pulls the weird actress thing.

The whole phone conversation I just keep repeating that I love her, that I’m not trying to get her in trouble, that I just want her to be safe and that she scared me. Most of all, I let her know I was confident that I *absolutely* did the right thing by calling the police and that I’m not at all sorry for doing so. I told her to keep me informed and that I will come pick her up at a moment’s notice; she told me she’d rather walk home.

Here’s the real kicker. She said something along the lines of, “Why did you ever feel the need to call the police? Why couldn’t you just….*talk to me?*” I am beyond frustrated that all my efforts to talk to her are ignored, and then later she criticizes me for not trying to talk to her….when that’s *all I ever try to do with her.*

She stayed overnight, and despite my efforts to get the hospital folks to give me a call when they discharge her, nobody did. She walked home this morning, and she’s giving me the silent treatment. And that brings us to the present moment.

How should I proceed, Reddit? I’m thinking of writing her a letter, because I think that will go further than any conversation we could have. I know that she will read it.

TL;DR- My mom and I have explosive fights. Pattern: I try and communicate, she tries to emotionally hurt me, succeeds, and the fight escalates. Last night she threatened to kill herself so I called the police. She basically hates me now. I just want a normal relationship with my mom.

I have a fetish that many would consider bad, but please read the explanation completely before thinking bad things about me. Basically the fetish is girls in physical pain, mostly to ""fleshy areas of the body"". It's not exactly the BDSM thing, but, I guess, close to it - imagine smth like drawings or films about gladiatrix fights, etc. Anything from cutting to simple beating counts; probably the best classification would be sadism. Just to clear a popular misconception: it doesn't have any roots in smth like misogyny, I just find the looks of a nice female body doubled over in pain sexy and beautiful. An important note: I never did anything like this in real life and I don't even think about it; drawings / stories do it for me. I *do* think that in real life it's a very bad thing.

It also doesn't mean that it's the only thing that turns me on - I have normal sexual interests apart with this one.

So, here's a thing: there is a girl whom I find attractive, but with whom I wouldn't be dating anyway because I don't like a lot of small things in her personality (also because I'm a shy and introverted person and she's all social). Everything was fine until I realized she started to play a role in a fantasy of mine where I imagine her being in pain (such as some staged catfight, or a straightforward BDSM session). It's something like ""oh, I wish I could see her in such situation"" (although, of course, I don't plan on making it happen at all).

This bothers me because, well, I don't wish her anything bad. She doesn't deserve anything bad. And while I'm not, of course, harassing her in any way (we barely interact at all), it still makes me feel bad that I'm thinking of *such* things about her. I mean, a lot of guys think in a sexual way of some girls they know (right?), but my case means thinking of other things done to her.

Should I just try to wipe these doubts from my head? Or is it a sign that I should stop thinking of her in such a way? Also, does it make me a bad person for thinking of her like this?

My grandmother has probably been depressed all her life. She divorced at a young age with her only child (my mother) and has lived alone most of her life due to her impossible personality. She wasn't much of a mother to my mom and left her completely alone in the house many times when she was a child. Needless to say, my mother is emotionally scarred from how my grandmother treated her (and continues to treat her). My grandmother has always had this need to clean things constantly and take 2 hr long showers to make sure every inch of her is clean. It's to a point where she did not really leave the house because she thinks everyone and everything is dirty. She is now in her mid 70's and has gotten much worse with the cleaning and she now screams in the middle of the night whenever she sleeps. 

She's been living with my mother, brother, and me for ~1 yr. My mother recently went through a divorce and because of financial problems (and the fact that she negatively affected my younger brother while he was dealing with the divorce), she had to put my grandmother in a nice nursing home. The place is actually run by an extremely nice couple that dedicate their lives to helping senior citizens. We know them personally and they do so much for my grandmother (more than we could ever do for her in the current situation.) My grandmother agreed to go. The lady that runs the place updates us constantly on my grandmother's condition but it's gotten to the point where nobody can really handle her. 

Also note she does NOT have Alzheimer's. My grandmother is actually extremely healthy (just not mentally). She screams so much at night that she wakes up all the sick, elderly people in the home. The lady was nice enough to buy her a phone, computer, and take her out to lunch often. However, my grandma repays her by complaining and telling her everything she gives her is useless. She constantly says she cannot stay in a house full of disgusting sick old people (she believes she is not sick in any way). 

My mother has suffered so much because of my grandmother and just got out of an abusive relationship. I am trying hard to help keep my mother and younger brother happy. I've tried so much to talk to my grandmother and tried to get her to see a psychologist but she just freaks out at the thought that something is mentally wrong with her. She flat out denies it.

He seems paranoid and makes outrageous statements about his extreme hatred for our country (US). Any attempt for discussion or offering our love ends in him screaming retorts and arguments to things we didn't even say... Its almost as if he's making things up in his head, I can barely explain it.

He obsessively rides his bike for hours an hours. He has one friend that nobody has ever seen, I don't know if the guy is 20 or 50. He smokes weed and eats mushrooms when he is with this friend.
He states he is neither interested in men or women. He can barely hold a job or go to school and has never completed anything he's started.

He goes everywhere my parents go, but says not one word, just stares. Doesn't listen to music, just sits there and watches them. One night my parents felt like they needed to lock the door while they slept because he was behaving so strange, they thought he was going to snap. He is running their lives, the mood of the house, they are walking on eggshells... It isn't fair to them.

We just want him to be happy. Whether its living with them, biking around the world, living with a guy in a trailer, we don't care... we just want him to be happy and safe. I feel like he is neither.

How do you help someone who doesn't think they need help? He seems to be so filled with hate and lacks empathy. What do we do? If anybody has a family member, close friend, or if they themselves have gone through something like this, I need any advice I can get. I'm scared. I'm at my wit's end. My head is constantly spinning.

I would be very interested in hearing about your own experiences with therapists/counselors/psychologists that you've had in the past.  Not necessarily the subject matter, but the types of things they did that you appreciated, or the things that you thought were unhelpful, damaging, nonsense, etc.  Or, if there were cultural issues (was your therapist from a different race, gender, sexual orientation?).

I hear too many horror stories about bad therapists, and I do not want to be in that category.  I really believe that your perspective is what matters, but seeking out mental health services is a sensitive subject that is hard to talk about, so it's difficult to get some perspective.  Your thoughts?

**edit**  I just got back and found all these really honest and helpful comments.  Fortunately, I could never imagine myself doing some of the things mentioned.

Well, yesterday, I get a really weird email from a guy who used to be a patient there. It was pretty incoherent, but seemed to be saying he wanted to get closure in regards to me touching him. I was like ""....wat?"" 

I then got another email from him a few hours later. Attached was a 2 page, single spaced letter he had written about how he was gay, and thinks about me all the time, called my parents to try and find where I was (I remember my parents telling me a few years ago that some mental health patient called, trying to find out how to contact me). I am guessing he got my email address from google searching my name, finding my youtube page, and seeing a few videos that have my email address on them.

He goes on about how no one ever touched him like I did (???), and how he wishes he would have accepted my advances. I have no idea what I could have done to give him such an impression, since I have a pretty strict ""no touching!"" rule with patients, and work very hard to maintain a professional relationship, so they know I am not their friend.

Anyway, I am not sure what to do. Do I call HR, even though I don't work with that company anymore? Do I just ignore it? I am thinking he either made this whole thing up in his head (he is schizo), or maybe it happened with someone else (maybe even another patient), and is somehow attributing it to me. I really am kinda freaked out about it.

TL;DR - A past mental health client of mine thinks we had some sort of pseudo-relationship when he was in treatment, and is now sending me weird emails.

UPDATE- Thanks for the advice everyone. I called the HR department, and forwarded the emails and whatnot to them. I am not sure what they are going to do about it, but at least they know about the situation. Also, unless HR says I should, I am not going to email the guy back. If it was just some normal person from my past, I would, but this is just a little too weird, and I would rather not deal with it. As Bsmoothec says, this is exactly what the guy wants me to do.

I’ve been having to meet people for some time.  It can be difficult, lol.  You have no trouble getting along with everyone, I have seen.  Would you like to please hang out together?

I’ve whiffed your aroma and imagine experiencing the intermingling of our body odors.  I have been tempting to investigate.  I have been drawn to you frequently in my fantasy life.  You are inside my mind for some time, but you would be welcome inside other places.  The idea causes much heat for me.  Would you like to see all this?  I would feel my mouth begin to water as your lips move closer to mine.  I would much enjoy the startled look in your eyes as you investigate inside my overwhelming pants.  I am inexperienced and impressionable.  I would want to gain your knowledge inside me.  For you to be gentle, yet confident.  For the bed sheets to be spotty with the blood of the memory of your dominance.  Call me 1-815-990-####.

My parents died when I was a teen, I became a single mother at 17, then I married at age 19 and had another daughter.  Looking back, I married out of survival. He was abusive, I divorced him 5 years later.  a single mother of 21 would spend the next 15 years of my life living for my children.  Working, sacrificing to make sure they had a roof over their head, food on the table and clothes for school.  If they needed and I didn't have it...I went without...in order for them to have.  Times were tough, but I made it through.
 
Then I married again; my firsts daughters father.  Great man...5 years of marriage, but learned he had a problem with oxi cotin.  Money disappearing, bills not getting paid...it just was not something I could understand after years of being so frugal.  Needless to say after tiresome efforts, I divorced him.  But by this stage in my life, I had 4 grandchildren.
 
So, now the children are grown. I am on my own.  I meet someone over the net, in another country, fall in love, marry, get my citizenship, thousands of miles away from my children and grandchildren.  And am learning my husband is verbally abusive, disrespectful, very selfish and has a problem with crack.  I had a job, but after sleepless nights and craz times in the home, I gave my resignation, as my home life was interfering with work.
 
So I sit here today, we have 5k in the bank, my car is needing a transmission and I am ready to call it quits and go back home.  But, if I tell him this he will ensure the money is tucked away.

I know I have to get a place, a job.  I don't even own a fork as I sold everything to come here.  I kick myself in the butt for making these bad decisions!  As I would of never been so vulnerable!

I don't feel motivated or determined. I guess when I had the girls, I knew I had to survive; for them, but now that it's just me, my will is diminished.  

Staying with my girls is not possible.  I do have a girlfriend who lives 250 miles from my girls but I want to be in the same area as my grandchildren.

As I've stated before, I've never had anything illegal, so these classes do absolutely nothing but waste my time.  


So here's the problem.  I've missed two of these classes and the judge for drug court is sending me to jail on Monday.  I have finals next week, not to mention it's really not fair that I even still have to go to the classes in the first place (although that's not why I missed them, I've had several bad things happen to me over the past month).  I'm trying to find the Drug Court contract for Alabama online to look it over and I'm also attempting to contact my lawyer, but he's out of town until tonight or tomorrow.  Is there any avenue I can take to avoid going to jail?


I apologize for the long and possibly rambling post, but this is pretty upsetting .

I, being in the position and having some money at the time I offered him the money he owed which was 500 quid. He is kind of flaky at the best of times and can not answer his phone at the best of times..

My money is starting to dwindle now so I sent him a text about three weeks ago asking if it was possible to organize paying me back over the next few weeks as my money was tight. He never responded so I sent another message, this time on facebook as I knew once he read it I could see it was received, He never responded to that either, and now he won't answer my calls either.

Its been over 6 months and I don't really want to be telling any of our mutual friends because I don't wanna fall out with him, or tell them the issue as it involved a bad decision by him and selling drugs.

What else can I do? i don't wanna call up to him as he will take it as being hostile...

Any advice you can offer, Sorry for the wall of text.

TLDR; Lent a friend 500 quid over 6 months ago and he won't answer my calls or texts.

UPDATE!

Edit: So I sent him another message in my annoyed state last night on facebook and let him know that I can see once he opens a message from me and that he needs to get in contact with me to talk about paying it back, He text me this morning to let me know that he had been flat out in work and meant to contact me but had forgotten, He said he has put in for overtime and is hoping to sort me out over the next few weeks.

I am glad he at least got in contact with me as its a small step closer, I don't really believe that he forgot to contact me as who forgets about 500 euro? He said he never answered my calls as his friend had his phone and never said I called even though I called a few times over the space of three hours.

I have a 2001 Durango, 4WD, that I took into a small smog test station today. The transmission was running fine, no leaks, smooth shifts, no clunking, when I brought it in. The mechanic took it in, pulled it up on the dyno, and was doing the tests when I heard a loud BANG and then gears grinding. He jumped out and threw it in park while the wheels were still moving, causing even more grinding. He shut off the car and cancelled the smog test while I watched, speechless. He then told me that somethings wrong and when I get it fixed he will gladly give me another smog test without charging me extra, and I was in awe. I kept asking what he did in there and he said it was broken before, but there's no way that's possible since he himself physically drove the car from the parking lot to the stall, and now it won't even move.

My parents seem to have developed a set of strange and unfair expectations of me and any time I don't meet these expectations I get hit with my most brutal passive aggressiveness.

Today's a good example. Over the last 2 years I have been doing all the grocery shopping for our family of 4 with no help and in that time I have only missed doing it on one occasion, when instead of doing the grocery shopping in person I got it delivered to the house. I woke up this morning feeling incredibly sick which is odd for me as I am never sick and asked my mother if she minded doing the grocery shopping. She wasn't doing anything today but got incredibly aggressive towards me. Told me that ""getting fresh air"" would help with my sickness and she explicitly said that she was angry with me for doing this to her. She eventually decided to just go and do it herself, but not before throwing more passive aggressiveness at me about how unhappy she was that her day was ruined.

That's just one case. I tend to cook dinner for everyone in the family every single day unless they order takeaway or go out to eat. I also do a large portion of the cleaning and many other household chores. They expect it from me, and when I don't do it I'm hit with all this passive aggressiveness and they make me feel as bad as they possibly can.

I'm getting tired of it. I feel like I'm living my life as a 40-year-old housewife when in actuality I'm a 19-year-old teenage guy! I want to have a life but I don't get time. Most of my days are spent inside the house and when I do try and do something for myself I can tell my parents aren't happy about it.

The worst part? My 28-year-old brother also lives in the house and does nothing, they don't expect anything from him and he can do as he pleases. He doesn't even pay my parents rent or anything.

- My Weekly Gaming Group doesn't game together anymore, but they don't call me for movies or anything either. I understand that several of them have lunch together regularly. I've suggested movie outings and stuff, but they seem to be doing that with their families instead. 

- My Long-time Friends like to go to movies as a group, but this past year they've only invited me one time. When I suggest others coming up, they say ""maybe""; but frequently I hear that they've seen it without me. One guy says I'm annoying because I'm always late or for other reasons.

Need advice please (apologize in advance for length).",22,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/154k52/gave_2_week_noticesince_have_heard_bosses_talking/,"To preface: I work in the entertainment industry. Namely I do a variety of jobs relating to the production of television. I am currently working as an Associate Producer for a small network that does most of its production in-house (For anyone with any interest it should be fairly simple to figure out who based on some of my history, but the info is pretty irrelevant to my current situation). I just gave my notice and will be leaving this job to get back into freelancing, starting right away working as a Jr. Shooter/Producer on an adventure show. I have been here 2 &amp; 1/2 months. Prior to this I was a Freelancer who got work of all different lengths doing all different things.

My need for advice comes from the job I am leaving rather than the one I am going to. Since giving my notice last week (well ahead of the expected in my industry) it has become quite clear they weren't terribly happy with my performance. At no point did they ever bring anything up with me. Throughout my brief employment here I have never received any feedback, never told that I needed to do more or less, or anything else. I have felt pretty on my own throughout my time. My responsibilities are minimal and after 2 weeks of really hunting for more to do I kind of gave up trying to do more and since just sit around waiting for stuff to come to me. I for the most part sit around and watch TV while waiting, or read blogs. They have never brought this up as a problem. I always get my work done in a timely fashion and thought that must have been all they were looking for. I never really was given the opportunity to prove myself or show what I have and bring to the table. The job they advertised turned out to not be what they actually wanted filled (hence my jumping ship), and as such I still have no idea what they are looking for out of my position.

Today while I had headphones on (normal), but nothing playing through them I overheard my two direct supervisors talking derisively of me with one of the hosts I regularly work with. Particularly about someone he had suggested to fill my position and comparing them with me. They speak of me as though I was the worst employee ever. Someone who didn't get the job. Someone who would rather sit idly than do their work. Someone who didn't bring anything to the team. It was an open conversation with no pretense of being something everyone shouldn't hear. In the middle of the office with all my coworkers around.

I am insanely full of emotions of all sorts. I want to have a private conversation with them. I want to throw a camera at the wall. I want to write a damning email that no one will read. I want to not show up tomorrow or storm out right now. I want to get into an argument via email with one or both of them. I want to stand up and start yelling at them. I want to do nothing at all. I...I don't know what to do. I just don't know.

I have two more weeks here. I don't do much so it isn't very taxing, and I could really use the easy money (paid days for the holidays). I want the money but I also don't know if I can just sit here and take it.

To clarify, I am good at working. What I lack in almost every facet of my life I excel at in the work place. I have always been the person to start any job in any field at a relatively low level and move up quickly. From sales floor to manager in a couple of months, from intern to 3 levels beyond entry in a year, etc. Accordingly I am my job, and always throw myself into work. I identify as my job and whatever I am doing at the time. I don't have much outside of work. When you regularly work 12-18 hours a day 5-7 days a week you don't get much of a chance at other things in life. When not working I have a very limited number of mostly solo activities I do. When out of work I tend to get pretty depressed. By commenting on my job they are commenting on me. By telling me I am not good at my job they are telling me I am not good.

My job is me. I work. That is what I do. And I am damn good at it, I think. 

This is bothering me so insanely much I cannot explain it. This isn't something I am used to or really experienced before. I know it fairly irrelevant because I am leaving this job in two weeks anyway, but I still feel this insane urge to do something.

I guess I want to know what I should do. Should I have any response, do anything at all? Should I fully swallow my pride and just suck it up and be miserable but get paid for 2 more weeks?

I know this was all over the place, and long as hell, but I have so much going on in my head right now I don't even know. So, ummm, thanks.

I couldn't be around my friends because smiling hurt. I sued him and two years later I lost the case. I'm slowly killing my body with pain killers but I don't care because I don't feel like I'm going to last much longer anyway. My TMJ is manageable now, but as soon as that was moderately okay, my back and neck started to hurt. I'm sick of the constant pain. [I've been listening to this song over and over, and I can't stop.](http://grooveshark.com/s/13+Ghosts+II/2HRzil?src=5)

I love video games, but now when I play them I have no one to enjoy them with. My best friend from college didn't invite me to his wedding so I took the hint and stopped talking to him. My other good friend from college, my drinking buddy and the guy I played all my games with, died in a motorcycle accident leaving my house a year ago. My best friend from highschool shut me out and didn't help me when I needed him most, so I stopped talking to him. I only have a few people I still speak with, and they're online friends. They still mean a lot to me but there's a huge divide between friends you can invite over and online friends. In games, the rewards feel meaningless now because I'm just doing them for myself and I don't care about myself. The whole point of getting achievements was to share them. I can't enjoy the story because I don't have enough free time. I always have reddit to share, but unless it's truly incredible it's not worth posting about. I keep buying games, but I don't want to play them. Maybe it's just this time of year, because I'm alone and I'm an atheist so I feel like I shouldn't celebrate Christmas anymore. I put lights up on my house and my little fake 2 foot tall LED Christmas tree, but these are all just reminders of how sad I have become.

The only thing I have left is my job and my amazing dog Alex. http://i.imgur.com/VAnXZ.jpg (He sat there for a full 2 minutes so that I could take the picture. He's so disciplined, and silly, and fun... I'm very proud of him.

I work for my parents and they push me harder than my body can handle. I constantly have to prove myself to them because they paid for my lawsuit so they see me as a financial burden, even though I made their website, do all of their computer work, get them a ton of business by being nice and helpful to customers. I constantly get complements on my work from other people. My back is so bad now that it never stops hurting. I'm hoping that I can rest it during the winter but the worst part is that they didn't believe me. I went to my doctor, got an x-ray, got a moving x-ray, and then I got surgery to kill the nerve endings in my back called Radiofrequency Rhizotomy. The preliminary surgery to even see if it would work backfired. The doctor couldn't get through my neck so he pushed harder and I came out of the surgery crying with twice as much pain as before. I started to have symptoms of a slipped disk. It felt like warm water was rushing over my legs, I couldn't move my arms sometimes. I was terrified. My parents made me go back to the doctor and get a list of limitations. He said I had no limitations, because all they saw was mild bone degeneration.

After that I worked as hard as I had to because my doctor said I had no limitations. The pain is severe now and I'm on a constant supply of tramadol. I take 3 types of sleep medications to go to bed every night and my parents, with this knowledge, still complain when I'm a few minutes late each day. Now that they're not working, they're much more reasonable, but when they're working, they hurt so bad they turn into monsters and take their pain out on me. It's not healthy, but we're all stuck where we are. When they're around I feel like I get through the day by being angry, because it helps keep my focus away from the pain and how depressing my life has become.

My mood changes from day to day but there's always this dark cloud looming over me. When I was born there were complications and the doctors had to take away my... ability to reproduce. Everything else works, I just can't have kids. Which makes it even harder for me. Alex, my dog, is so special to me, it's the closest I can feel to having the perfect child and then him being diagnosed with cancer. I don't want to outlive him, and while I'm stable now, I don't know what I'll do when he starts to get sick.

I tried secret santa this year, and it didn't help. I pretend like it was good, for others sake, but it just made me feel worse. I haven't gotten my gift yet, but I don't know how I'll feel when I get it. I was on antidepressants, but my parents made me stop using them even though they were helping me. They thought I was yelling at them because of the medications, and now I don't know what to do. The medication that I was taking was in direct conflict with my pain meds so I can't go back on them even if I wanted to now or I could risk having a seizure. I'm on the max dosage of tramadol and I still barely make it through the day.

She had a rough patch last year but seemed to come back from it and make some progress. However, apparently this summer she fell very much back into old ways, and that has carried over into the new school year. She now throws up on a regular basis, gets blackout drunk almost every night, and sleeps around with almost everyone.

Normally I think I could help give her advice and try to get her life back in order (I was able to do it several times last year), but so far she's not responded well to any advice. To make things worse, her lifestyle is starting to negatively affect the people closest to her and drive them away, which only serves to fuel her self-hatred and harm herself more. She recognizes that she has problems and needs to get her life in order, but no matter how much I try to motivate her, she refuses to actually take any steps to improve her life. Quite frankly, I'm out of ideas, because it's reached the point where she's wallowing in self-pity but isn't changing her lifestyle or showing any *real* remorse for the effect she's having on her closest friends.

Obviously, I think it'd be best if she went and actually spoke to a professional, but I don't think that will happen realistically. I could use some advice for how to proceed -- it feels like we all need to put our collective foot down and try a hardass approach, but I'm worried that that'll only drive her deeper into depression.

Here's an example: I found a program/tool yesterday (let's call it 'X'), and it fascinated me, I understood it, and then I used it to build two small example projects. The files are saved.

Today, I saw X mentioned somewhere and I remembered ""oh, I know that name"" then ""oh, I used that yesterday!"" then ""oh, I don't remember what it does""

That freaked me out. So I went to look at the files that I made, and I had some issues finding it because I forgot how the folders were set up.

And when I got to them, I didn't immediately recognize how these couple of files interacted and how I used them. I needed to open them up to get a flashback of what I was doing... and my understanding wasn't nearly as clear as it was when I was working on it.

To reiterate: this was a really incredibly simple tool.

*****

That was just one example. But I'm always forgetting what my last meals were, or if I took my pills, or what day of the week it is. It's affecting my life in serious ways: health, finances, and relationships.

I've taken a (fucking expensive) cognitive assessment with a ""educational psychologist"", and it didn't show any problems. The tests themselves were really poor, and I don't think they even tested the kind of memory loss that plagues me.

My general practitioner doesn't really know what he's doing either. Even after I mentioned my memory concerns, he was focussed on whether or not I have ADD and/or anxiety. He gave me meds for ADD.

I've taken ADD meds and they don't seem to affect me much. I think I might have anxiety, but I'm not sure (his small assessment said I don't). I've started taking some otc nootropics, but I haven't been on them long enough to understand how they affect me.

My memory and 'flow' seem to fluctuate largely based on my anxiety from school (compounded by my memory problems) and perhaps my health (eating and exercise) as well. I procrastinate and browse the internet to calm myself and escape the world of stress.

For the longest time, I thought I just had terrible time management skills. I don't regularly do schoolwork outside of class, and I do procrastinate for studying and assignments. 

However, when I forget that I just drank a glass of water... or I forget what I did yesterday or last week, it makes me think that I have some serious issues.

Obvious throwaway here. Here's what happened:

Last week, I was watching TV on my couch. The apartment layout allows me to see out the glass doors that overlook the parking lot. I heard a crunch and I glanced out to see a car trying to pull into the parking space next to my car and hitting my car. I take a closer look, and sure enough, she hit my car.

I throw on some shoes and a jacket and go out to talk to her. After she pulls in and out of the parking space for about 2 minutes (obviously stalling), I just walk down there and ask if she hit my car. She denies everything, even going so far to say she would NEVER hit a car EVER because she's so careful. Right.

I go upstairs to grab a flashlight and think about the situation. By the time I get downstairs, she's already vanished. Look at my car, yup, there's damage, but it's not terrible. I think we might be able to resolve this without insurance, so I go knock on her door (she IS my neighbor, so I know who she is). She refuses to answer, and I KNOW she's in there.

Whatever, fine, I'll file a police report, take pictures, the whole nine yards. Do that and decide to try her door the next day. Same non-answer. I leave a note with the case number and my info, if she has any questions or anything. As I walk back to my apt, I hear her door open and she takes the note and closes the door before I can get back out there.

Yesterday, I was walking out to my car and noticed that her car is now PRISTINE and looks brand-new. She got her car fixed immediately. This makes me think that she's going to try to get out of the case. Now I'm pissed. Here are my questions:

1. Can she simply point to her now-fixed car and say she didn't do it? I have photographic proof of both cars' damage, as well as a witness.
2. Since the damage on my car could be considered minimal (under my $500 deductible), will the cop simply dismiss the case or will it sit on his desk forever? Can I do anything about this?
3. If the case DOES end up dismissed, what are my chances of taking her in small claims? I have photographic evidence, a police report, and a witness (other than myself). I feel pretty good about my chances, but I need advice.

Before you say it, yes, I know this is probably an overreaction for some scraped paint and a dented bumper, but her denial and avoidance are driving me insane. Also, the apt staff insinuated that she's a troublemaker and has done this many times before.


**TL;DR: Saw my neighbor hit my car, she's avoiding me and doing everything she can to deny it happened.**

EDIT: Sorry for the radio silence; yesterday was spent with insurance and handling this. I filed with my insurance company after making sure my rate wouldn't go up (woot USAA, and thanks Woodrow). They're amazing, and they're handling it wonderfully. They suggested waiting until the police report goes through, but they're going to fight for my money, no matter the outcome. Thanks to everyone for their advice. You guys actually helped me calm down about this and think clearly for a few minutes, which was exactly what I needed.

Alright, I'm [genderqueer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer). This question needs a bit of explaining so bear with me. Those who were born female might be better able to help me on this if you want an excuse not to read this giant paragraph. lol

I was born female but I was born with an [imperforate hymen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen#Anatomic_anomalies). It was so complete that until I was 15, I thought that I was neither male nor female and was instead something in between. I LOVED the fact that I was neither and never told anyone. When I was 15, I got very sick. We had to have an emergency surgery to give me an opening there because I had started my period in the lady parts I didn't think existed or I would have died from sepsis (no exaggeration, it was bad). The trauma of past visits to the hospital (diagnosed psych disorder) combined with this one and the incredible gender confusion after it gave me a strong phobia of hospitals.

Now I'm 21. I've never had a follow up exam like I was supposed to, I've never had a gyno visit. I've been to the hospital a few times since then (picking up a friend from the ER [had a panic attack while there], fractured my spine [panic attack], had x-rays for my spine [almost panic attack, drank a lot afterward], another visit to the psychward [fffffffuuuuuuu]). I wasn't able to see my grandma when she fell down a flight of stairs. I'm not able to go see her in the Alheimer's ward right now even though she may only have a few months left. I wasn't able to go with my boyfriend when he cut open his arm with a sword while dueling. I can't drive down the street next to a hospital without blanking out in fear and possibly getting into a car wreck. I can't go to the little clinic when I have a 104.7 F fever. I can't see or hear an ambulance without feeling anxious. I'm nervous as hell around doctors and nurses even when they're off duty. If I know someone is in a medical profession, they make me nervous (except dentists, no idea why).

I know I should go to the gyno. I know that logically. I have trouble dealing with the fact that I even have lady parts much less have anyone look at them. I don't like the fact that I've never been tested for VD. I don't like the fact that I could have cancer and not know it. I LOVE the fact that I only have to deal with a period once ever 3-ish months for 3-4 days but I'm pretty sure that's not normal. It might be just my body knowing how much I hate it. I hope so.

What can I do? Who can I talk to? I've had therapists before but never focused on this specific issue. It's really hard to talk about because I get nervous as hell when I think about it. Last time I brought it up with a psychiatrist, I started crying. Which I am right now a bit. Any advice at all is welcome. I have no idea what to do but I know that especially with my medical past, I should figure it out sooner rather than later.

About the transgender thing, I would LOVE to get surgery to be more androgynous (get rid of my boobs) but the idea of going through another surgery is just...I can't. There's no way in hell. I'm scared shitless now and I'll probably be scared shitless when I get the money to do it. It's just not going to happen and I hate myself for it.

[x-post]",21,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/fp2xc/left_my_apt_complex_in_nearperfect_condition_and/,"Hi reddit, My boyfriend and I spent 3 days cleaning, scrubbing, and making our apartment spotless. The only issues we left were 1) a barely-noticeable bleach stain the size of a credit card and 2) a few marks on one wall from where the bed was. The property manager who did my move-out inspection commended me for doing such a great job cleaning and went so far as to say she didn't foresee any large deductions from my deposit of $400.
Lo and behold, 20 days later, I get a few statements. The painter claimed that the walls were ""filthy"" and that he spent 3 hours on the one wall, which should only have needed 2 coats of paint. The property manager decided that ALL of the carpet in the apartment needed to be replaced, and since it was newly replaced when we moved in back in 2009, it would be prorated where we would have to pay 80% of the cost of replacement.
I am shocked and feel like I've been cheated. This was my first apartment, so I didn't think to take pictures upon move-out. I know that the property manager took a few pictures during move-out; she had a piece of paper with my name and the date on it and she made sure it was placed in every picture she took. I'm actually glad she took pictures because aside from the bleach stain, nothing else could be reasonably construed as ""damage beyond normal wear and tear.""
My boyfriend and I really can't afford the $1200 they're demanding. But what's more important is that it's completely unfair and we feel as though they are intentionally ripping us off. My first step is to request pictures of all the ""damages."" What do I do next? What are my rights? What options do I have?
Any advice/direction would be much appreciated. 
Thank you.

She said she ""wasn't comfortable paying for it"" and essentially accused either me or my boyfriend of breaking the heating, which is basically fucking impossible.

We've got radiators. There's a valve that looks like some sort of release valve on each, with numbers that go from 0 - 8. Then there's a valve on the pipe that leads into the radiator, which I assume controls the flow of gas. The radiator in our bedroom works most of the time but still doesn't keep the place very warm. The radiator in the living room is turned to the same settings as the one in the bedroom and makes noises, so I know it's working, but doesn't do much for heat.

I don't have a thermostat so I can't even control how warm it is. The landlady offered at one point to get some space heaters until someone checks out our heat, but she pays for heat and WE pay for electricity, so I feel like this is a ploy. I've looked up the legalities and there's no way I'm paying for this, as there's no way we ""broke"" the heat.

Not from a bank or a predatory lender, but from family.  Her father convinced us to buy a house from him through a land contract two years ago.  We reluctantly agreed but it was better than the place we were living at.  It was closer to my wife's job and in a better neighborhood for our kids.  After a few talks and against our better judgement we settled on a verbal agreement for the purchase of the house then moved in.  

After a couple of months the final sale price was raised from $45K to $62K.  A few more months and the monthly payment was raised.  And just five months ago the sale price went up to $69K.  We knew after the first price raise that we needed to find something else but due to how much money was going out versus coming in, we just couldn't and would have to sit things out.  Yesterday he told my wife that we had to secure a bank loan for $50K or we would basically become renters and that he wanted our decision/results on Friday.  His intentions are to put the house back on the market.  

The problem comes in when he wants us to pay as renters  until the house is sold.  He is not lowering the payment so that we can save money to get into a new place.  So my wife and I started calling banks in order to try and get a loan, but with less than fair credit it is hard.  Every bank we talked to turned us down either due to past credit history or not meeting the minimum down payment.  We even tried to get a loan to buy a cheap house.  It really upset me that we couldn't secure a loan for a $25K fixer-upper that we knew we could pay back with no problems.  It would have been a tight fit for my family in 2 bedrooms, but we would have made due.  The loan could have been paid back in 10 years while at the same time allowing for us to have extra funds to put into adding a third bedroom after just 6 months and increasing the value of the home.  We also talked to a few of the high risk lenders with no success.  I looked at peer-to-peer lending organizations, but we can't use one of them for this since we're not starting a business in a developing country.  I talked to a lawyer too.  He pretty much said what I already knew as far as any legal action is concerned.  Which is nothing.  Our word versus my in-laws word since it was all a verbal agreement.  Even though we have  the stubs from the money orders we sent, there is nothing that can be done.  We had hopes for one more local bank that we went to today, but we got turned down there as well.  

Our last option is following up on the advice of a friend to try the local housing authority.  The only problem with doing this is that even if we get approved it could be months before they have a home that they could place us in.  Still, it's better than nothing.  I also called my parents back home to make sure that if things don't work out,  we can send the kids down there for the summer while my wife and I live out of our car saving money to get things sorted.  Other than all that, here we are...  at a complete loss for what we can do to make sure our family has a place to call home.  We are in dire need of advice, suggestions (in case we missed something), and even jokes (we need a few good laughs to cheer us up).

They said it was okay, gave me the key and I moved it last weekend. Now today I'm finishing up cleaning/moving out the old apartment. I'm moving things down to the new storage and there isn't a thing down there.  

I already called them to let them know, but it's a Sunday so they aren't doing anything about it today. It's not an emergency, according to them. I plan on going to talk to them first thing in the morning. If they stored it somewhere, that is the best case scenario. Chance's are they threw it out thinking it was the old tenant's. I don't suspect theft. I did lock it and there's nothing of significant monetary value in there. Some things I can replace. It'll be a pain but I could get new ones. Like luggage, xmas decorations, and winter clothes. Other things were sentimental value. Some handmade items I inherited from my great-grandmother were in there.

I just need to know what my options are if they did throw it out. What should be my strategy going in tomorrow? Anything I'm forgetting that should be done? I do have renter's insurance.

Background info: I was severely, ritually sexually abused as a child. The main perpetrator (around 4 years, from 2-5 and a half) was a ""family friend"" and father figure when my own father was away. He was a cop and ""otherwise an upstanding citizen."" (In quotes because I don't believe it.) I was also abused for two separate years (8-9 and 12-13) by two separate teachers, one exponentially worse than the other; my sixth grade teacher repeatedly raped and molested me. He took videos and pictures; to this day I do not know what he did with them. He also had a ""friend"" in on it (I use the word also because in case I didn't mention, perp. A had a friend he would sometimes invite over when he was abusing me). This teacher did perhaps more psychological damage than the first two perpetrators combined. I am absolutely convinced he was a sociopath and 100% pure evil. And as if all this wasn't enough, I was raped two other times at 14 and 18. The first was by a friend of my brother's who spent the night. The second was a gang rape on the night of my high school graduation party. I wasn't drunk or in any way impaired. One of the kids was a friend of mine who graduated the year before me, and his younger brother was also a participant. It was one of the worst nights of my life.

Anyway... that's not why I've come here. The reason why I post this is to give you a small look into what I experience on a day to day basis and get your opinions on what it might be. To my knowledge, it doesn't quite fit any psychological illness I've ever heard of (and I've done extensive research).

For as long as I can remember, I have had other people in my head besides me. And not nameless strangers either -- specifically, the people in my head are book, TV, and movie characters. Started off with just a few characters from shows I watched as a kid (Luka Kovac and John Carter from ER, for example) and grew as I grew and absorbed new fictional characters. When I say they're ""in my head,"" I quite literally mean that. They have nearly as much agency as I do but don't ever ""surface"" or ""front"" like in Dissociative Identity disorder. But they can see what I do (both from my point of view and from an outsider's point of view. They make commentary on it (not commentary that I hear as in auditory hallucinations (like from schizophrenia) and I ""know"" what they think and the like. I have developed to where I can ""control"" what they have access to seeing/hearing/etc. at times but not all the time. It feels like I'm constantly on display; constantly being watched. Sometimes it doesn't bother me but other times I feel overwhelmed and unable to focus on anything because of this.

1367208829.0,16,self.needadvice,1dbgce,my roommate/flatmate may or may not have raped his girlfriend.,24,8,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1dbgce/my_roommateflatmate_may_or_may_not_have_raped_his/,"**UPDATE:**  Spoke to the girl, she says everything's fine.  I believe her.

**Original post:** I call him my roommate, but we share an apartment with a common room, kitchen, and separate bedrooms and bathrooms.  I guess in the UK it would be called a ""flatmate,"" though that's all just semantics.  The walls are pretty thin.  We got along cordially; we're not the best of friends but there weren't any big problems between him and me.  

My roommate's relationship with his girlfriend has been rocky ever since she got pregnant and they aborted it.  Last week she told him they were through, and she moved her stuff out of the apartment a few days ago.  Evidently, he had convinced her to give him a second chance, since she kept coming over, watching TV together, hosting mutual friends, laughing and joking, and having sex (thin walls), but she still got upset and said some things to the effect of ""You're not making me feel like I want to stay in this relationship""

A couple of hours ago, she was crying over their relationship woes.  Then they both went to his room.  About an hour ago, it happened.

With the thin walls, I kept hearing her say ""Get off me!  Get off me!""  Once or twice, I would have dismissed it as some normal playing, but she kept saying it.  ""Get off me!  Get off me!""  At one point it sounded like she was being muffled.

I couldn't sit by, I knocked on the door, asked her what the fuck was going on, those aren't normal sex noises.  The door was slightly open but I wasn't in a position to see anything.

There was a pause.  My roommate said, somewhat angrily, ""Get out.""  I went back to my room.  She wasn't yelling any more, but there was some kind of quiet murmuring that I couldn't hear.  As far as I could tell, they weren't having sex any more.  I don't know if it was him talking, her talking, or both of them talking.  Not knowing what else to do, I packed up my stuff and left the apartment.

My roommate has never struck me as the type of person who would get angry or violent.  He's always been very laid back and friendly.  That's why I don't know what to do next.  I don't *think* he's the type to rape anyone but I heard all the signs.

**EDIT:**  To be a little more clear, I don't know the girl very well, and I haven't even really spoken with her.  Most of what I know about her is either from him or inferred.  They both like weed, dubstep, and netflix.  Until now they've tended to have frequent, loud sex, but ""get off of me"" was something I'd never heard her say before, much less ten times in a row.  

The more I think about it, the more I want to just distance myself from this whole situation.  Nothing about their relationship is normal at this stage, and from my perspective it's obvious that it's ending whether he wants it to or not.  Aside from that, it's finals week and I have my own shit to deal with.  It's been 17 hours and I still haven't been back to the apartment.

**UPDATE:**  Well, that was surreal.  I came home, 18 hours after the fact.  My roommate's door was open.  To try and clear the air, I stood outside and called in that I was sorry for barging in last night.  I instead heard his girlfriend say ""Um... okay.""  He wasn't there.  She was there, on his bed, eating chinese food, watching doctor who.  I asked her if everything was fine last night, and she said it was.  I told her to tell him I'm sorry for overreacting.

My girlfriend (not asking for relationship advice) has always had trouble with depression. Her mother is bipolar and she has been taking medicine against depression for almost 10 years. (she stopped taking them 2 years ago after things started to go uphill).

Ever since I knew her I've always tried to give her more confidence. Giving compliments, be a listeningspost, rationalize her stress etc.

However things have gone downhill the last couple of weeks. She's in constant stress and she thinks that everything she does is wrong and nobody likes her. I try to help her as much as I can but she's crying about 5-6 times a day now. 

I've been trying to apply logic to the situation because most of her stress and insecurity is based on fear not logic. This always worked  for the last 1.5 years but not anymore. 

I can get her to calm down, but if she leaves for work for example, I usually get a message within 2 hours that's she's started crying again for the simple reason that somebody asked her ""how she was doing""

Here's a situational example ; she was talking that she was not good enough to do her work, all her coworkers are way better, she feels stupid when around them etc. However she just got a 1 year contract after working there on a 0 hour base for 8 months. So I try to explain to her that it doesn't make any sense to think like that because if her employers thought that she is bad, she would not have gotten a better contract with steady hours.

I don't need advice on our relationship I just want advice on how to be able to make her life better.

About four years ago, I realized (over time) that two-thirds of my late teens/early twenty's memory's were completely false. I had made up a best friend and several girlfriends and had memories of spending time with them, attending real events (parties, holiday's...). This stopped until I left to attend a University and had a mental break. I had convinced myself that one of these people had killed themselves and I was inconsolable and hospitalized for severe depression over it. I was traumatically scarred by this event and would spend hours thinking of my friend and missing her. I could not function to the point of spending days in a semi-catatonic state. I was stoned or drunk more than I was sober. I was not really suicidal but I was so depressed and saw no end in site, that I constantly cried and would seclude myself. I did not care about anything and my entire personality started changing. I wanted to be alone and did not like to be around others.

But then over about a three month period, I started to remember people and events that were not consistent with these other memories.

One day, it dawned on me that I had created an entire another life and it took me a while to accept what my brain was trying to tell me. First, I was ashamed because I had affected so many other people with this other life. I had put my family and friends through hell and worry because of my *friend's* made up suicide and this other life was so predominant over much of the last 15 years.

I was afraid to talk to anyone about my realization because, even though it was unintentional, I had lied to almost everyone I knew. And then I started wondering what else I may have made up in my past and became really concerned that I had done things or not done things, that I just could not remember. And even if I did remember something, I am afraid that it could just be another false memory.&gt;/p

I had done something similar when I was in High School. But it did not have the impact that my *friends* suicide had. I realized that some of the people/events in High School, as well as some of my friends, had been manufactured as well. Knowing that I had had invented a good chunk of my teen years shook me to the core. But the realization that my relationship with my *friend* was a lie, is what really got to me.

I believe the trigger for my realization was that I was finally getting married to my fiancé of almost twenty years. Thinking of all of the times that she had dealt with me crying, not working, being depressed, having uncontrollable emotional outburst, being hospitalized, breaking up with her, verbal fights.... was really hard for me to admit to. I had put her through so much pain and had caused so many problems in our relationship because of this. I felt sick to think of all of the things that she had been put through. But I finally told her the truth and let the chips fall as they may. Not only did she completely forgiven me but she has not held any of it against me. We don't talk about it because she knows how ashamed I am about what I had done.

To my surprise, I am now happier than I have ever been. I appreciate things more and no longer take things for granted. I have a unbelievable amount of peace and satisfaction. Things that would have sent me over the edge before, I rarely even notice now. I have started seeing the world in an entirely new light. I started taking more of an interest in the world around me. Reading and watching documentaries, I started realizing how much was out there and how much I had missed out on while I was in this state. I have become really interested in science, astronomy, earth/planetary science's, paleontology, world history… I am no longer depressed, I don't have break down's. Trigger's such as dates, songs, events..., no longer upset me. There were so many days of the year that would send me into a low state. Her birthday, Christmas, the day she died, the day we met... If I saw a car that was the same make/model… Seeing someone in public or on TV that looked like her or that had the same name. But now I can barely remember any dates, and days come and go without me even realizing that a certain date had passed. There are very few times in my life that I even think about any of that and when I do, I don't get upset or depressed (just embarrassed).

The reason that I am asking about this now, is because I am trying to understand WTF happened, will it happen again, and if there are any more surprises in my brain that just haven't surfaced.

Background (Everything that follows has been independently verified for accuracy):

I grew up in a semi-poor family with a lot of violence between my parents. I don't think that my sister or I were abused but we witnessed; knife fights, car chases, gun fights, screaming and yelling, my parents splitting up (or threatening to). I can't tell you the times that my father had pointed a gun at my mother and pulled the trigger - only to point the gun away at the last minute. Shooting into the wall or the car. I had not friends in elementary or middle school and was picked on because of economic difference's between myself and my classmates who overwhelmingly came from upper-middle class homes. We had lived in the state of Washington, Texas, South Carolina, Florida, but we always seemed to come back to our home in Western North Carolina eventually.
My mother left my father and moved to Florida with another man. She left me behind with my father (supposedly so he wouldn't come after her to get me) and on top of everything, my father was an alcoholic and was emotionally distant.

I bounced from living with my father, sister, an aunt, mother, grandmother, uncle's and a family friend. No matter where I lived, I tried to be alone as possible by going for walks or riding my motorcycle on the backroads and logging roads. I became less isolated in High School, where I started making friends and dating. I was able to change my personality based on the group of people I was with. So I had no trouble fitting in with the goth's, jocks, brains, bands geeks, slackers, partiers… I was very imaginative and wrote a lot of short stories and poetry (which the girls ate up!). I listened to almost any genre of music and could engage in almost any conversation whether it was boring out a corvette engine, riding horses, riding four wheeler's into the backwoods or discussing Edgar Allen Poe.

My nights have been plagued with nightmare's since I was a very small child. All night, every night. Monster's on occasion, but for the most part they were about people dying or being killed. Someone is always in danger, running from danger, or begging for their lives. The dreams are always horrifically detailed and run through my head like a movie with; beginnings, middles, ends, plots, dialog, characters…

In my Junior year is when I made up my first friend, as well as a few girl friends. I could recall spending time with them, talking on the phone, going for rides in the forest, having dinner… One of these people really but I barely knew here and had only dated her a few times. The rest were not based on any of the friends that I had or girls that I dated. I didn't talk about these people to my real friends but would spend a lot of time listening to music or riding around thinking that these people were as real as anyone else.

I met my fiancé three years before my *friend* took her life. I didn't talk about my *friend* to my fiancé because my *friend* just happened to be an ex-girlfriend who I broke up with because I was cared for her so much that I wouldn't let myself give in to those feelings, for fear of losing her and crushing my heart.

I believed these friends existed until about four years ago. I could tell you their birthday's, what car's they drove, their personal histories, their family lives and history. I can still remember hanging out with them, cruising with them, having sex, going to the beach… I could tell you the quirks that they had… Honestly, I think that if I wrote it all down, I could write their biographies in vivid detail.

tl;dr - my best friend in High School, as well as several girlfriends never existed. One of these friends killed themselves and sent me into a mental breakdown. I only just realized these people were not real about four years ago.

I appreciate your attention and look forward to your response.

I've earned awards and accolades everywhere I've been until now.  I work at a company that went bankrupt last year, and was purchased by a larger company.  Larger company writes my checks, but I report to the former owner of the smaller company (Now a division of larger company).

This is happening in the state of *Texas*.**

My friend has a signed lease on the place he's living in that's good through next year.  The property was foreclosed and is now owned by ""the bank.""  The bank has an obligation to honor the existing lease and isn't trying to kick my friend out, which is good.  Since they own the house, my friend now sends his rent checks to the bank (more specifically, the property management company representing the bank) at their request.

The problem is that the previous owner (my friend's former landlord) is disputing the foreclosure and has hired legal counsel to fight it.  The law firm representing the previous owner is telling my friend that he needs to send them the checks instead so they can deposit the rent into a trust until the dispute is settled.  They have demanded that he stop payment on the current rent check and submit all payments to them.

My friend is now caught in the middle.  He fears that stopping payment on the check will give the bank cause to kick him out.  Banks will apparently look for any minor breach of the lease agreement to evict tenants of foreclosed homes (shitty, but it makes sense).  He's also concerned about legal action from the former owner's lawyers.

The situation is a complete cluster.  I initially recommended he lawyer up, but I was hoping reddit might be aware of specific laws in place that protect him as a tenant from this sort of thing.  There are already laws that require the bank to honor the remaining time on the lease.  Are there similar laws that protect him from getting harassed by the former owner and his attorneys?

Also, can the bank just take over the lease like that or does the lease have to be re-executed for the remaining term?  From that aspect, I can see the former landlord having a legal leg to stand on with regard to continuing to receive rent checks from my friend, because it was through him the original lease was executed.

Either way, right now it seems safest to continue to pay the bank as they are the ones with the power to kick him out if he doesn't pay.

Thanks for your advice!

I feel like I'm in a constant state of being okay.  I'm just not sure if it's okay to live like this.  There's apart of me that questions am I really living a life in the way that a human should.  I don't really know what a person or human really is, I'm not even sure what being happy or being sad is, I can't seem to recall what being angry feels like anymore.  At times it feels like I'm just an outsider watching, constantly watching, as things go by.  I'm affected by it, but it will pass either way, and no matter what, things move on.  Yet I'm also so intimately connected to everyone and everything, because I'm involved in their lives. 

For me, life and death just seems to happen.  It'll be okay if the Earth and everything on it was suddenly destroyed, because for me it existed, though I would be gone too, I still imagine that's how I'd feel.  If I get killed, assaulted, tortured, dropped to a state near death, that's okay too.  True, there'd be pain, desperation, and other associated things, but that's the response to that kind of state.  

It feels weird to feel like this all the time, it seems to me that not many people feel like I do.  I go through a lot of motions and reactions, tailored to people and their patterns that I've observed.  My friends seem so set in their patterns and firm in their beliefs. (Though I understand that though they display that on the outside, there might still be inner doubt)  I'm really jealous that they can settle and display so firmly a state of mind.  It never seems to happen for me, I just flow from one to another, it's okay to compromise as long as an answer is reached, it's okay to change because you get to see new things.

But it's not sad for me at all, I do enjoy the world.  It's wonderful to see things swaying in the wind, clouds in the sky, people walking by - people walking by living their lives completely unaware of things, of all kinds of things.  I'm not sure if I'm crazy or not, I wonder if I'm insane, I wonder if I'm sociopathic.  Though I am content and happy, I wonder if I should feel sad more often.  Life isn't great but it's life, I can wake up in the mornings, go do work, eat, hug my plush toys, and a day passes.

Nope. Then I wrote a note and stuck it (postit note) to the top of the toilet tank saying ""Please flush your used toilet paper"". I can only think of one reason why he wouldn't be flushing it - he uses a lot and maybe is afraid of it clogging or had an experience with actually clogging it at one point and has thrown it out ever since.

* I have managed to save a little over $10k  which will serve as the initial down payment.

* Used the handy mortgage calculator at zillow to calculate what price range I can afford, as well as how much the closing costs will be.

* Surfed zillow.com and realtor.com like crazy in my spare time, figuring the approximate location and features that fit within that price range.

**What I am going for and why**

I am looking to buy something along the lines of a 4 bedroom, 2+ bathroom house here in South Florida, at no more than 260K.  I would like to get a 15-year mortgage so that I can have it paid off that much sooner.  I know that the longer I wait and the more I save, the better that the deal is going to be.  Unfortunately, forces outside of my control are kind of forcing my hand at this point.  Now is the time

Believe me, I've googled a bunch of stuff about first time home buying, and mostly end up at either a realtor's website or a site that wants to sell me super special insider information for a one time fee or subscription.  Well screw that noise.

So long story short; I must have been asleep the day they covered home buying in the How To Be An Adult class, and I never got a copy of the notes.  Can I get some simple, down-to-earth advice from you all?  Possibly in a step-by-step format or speedrun video on youtube?  Please take the condescending tone of talking to a complete newbie, because that is exactly what I am.  This is the biggest purchase of my life and I would like to represent the culminated wisdom of my fellow redditors and handle it like a pro. 

Some basic questions (but please fill me in on every nuance):

* Who, exactly do I contact first?  A mortgage company?  A broker? The seller?

* Do I get the mortgage pre-approved?  Does that mean I have to get a house for exactly that amount or can it be less? (or more?)

* Really, do I get a realtor, or mortgage broker, or agent, or what?  I am not even sure what the difference is or if they are all the same thing.  Who helps me do what?  And do they represent my desire to buy a house or are there to facilitate the selling of the house for the seller?

* I read in one of the guides that it is possible to not even need...one of those things from above...if you hire a real estate lawyer to draw up all the paperwork.  True or not?  Hazards?

* Can closing costs be part of the mortgage or is doing that just dumb?

* Is there some kind of government program that can assist me with making intelligent decisions about this?  I mean, I think I can find a home that I want to buy, but can they guide me through the rest of it?

And barring all that, is there a trust-worthy site on the internet that can explain all of this to a first timer like me?

only child to aging parents?",20,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/inf3i/how_can_i_do_what_i_want_with_my_life_as_an_adult/,"**TL;DR - Need advice on how to make life decisions as an adult when you're the only child of aging parents who will make you feel guilty for choices that make it harder for you to care for them.**

I am well into my adult life (been living on my own for over 12 years now) and am feeling somewhat trapped in life by my parents. The major issue is that I'm an only child and as my parents, who are 70 now, get older, they'll have nobody but me to care for them. 

My dad will always be fine. He's pretty laid back and as a former military guy and retired law enforcement he can take care of things. He'll always want to be able to take care of himself, but if he can't then he'd much rather go live in a community where he can make friends and have whatever fun he can. 

My mom is a completely different story. She's always been fairly emotionally fragile and the littlest of things can send her into crying fits. If I don't call her or see her (e-mail and IM don't count) once a week, I'm a terrible son and I don't love her. What makes it worse is that she's so depressing to talk to - only discussing who's recently died, what illnesses are going around or other negative things. If I don't bring her a card on her birthday, even if I call or visit to take her to dinner, then I'm a terrible son and don't love her. She has spent most of her life worrying about things and continues to do so. If I don't call her when I get home from a trip, she thinks I'm dead and when I finally do talk to her I get an earful about how if I really loved her I would call so she wouldn't worry. Once we had a conversation about her using a grocery service so she didn't have to haul heavy items home from the store while my dad was away on business and she got upset and started crying because it meant I didn't want to come take her to the store. The only issue where my dad comes in is that he gets mad at me whenever I ""make"" my mom upset. So he won't get upset about me for stupid little things like my mom does, but he does get mad at me when I do something that upsets her. She doesn't drive because she has panic attacks on the road. She also doesn't fly because she's too afraid. 

Remember, I'm an adult... I'm not a 15 year old living at home and not doing his chores. 

I've never lived more than a few hours away from them. This is partly because I've been made to worry about something happening to them and me not being nearby. The other part is that I've been made to worry that something will happen to me and they won't be nearby. These are both things my mom has told me flat out whenever I've discussed living further away.  

As I've gotten older, I've started to develop more and more of my mom's attitude and I'm trying to stop it. I don't want to end up barely being able to leave my house. After seeing a doctor and being diagnosed myself, I believe most of her side of the family has psychological issues that they won't acknowledge or see someone about. This isn't something I couldn't even bring up with her because she would get overly upset. 

All that said, I'm currently in a financial and career position where I could easily move anywhere in the United States. I've been disenchanted with where I live for quite some time now - the attitudes, the traffic, the weather... and am seriously thinking about jumping ship and moving all the way to the other side of the country. Also, after dealing with the diagnosis of these psychological problems and the issues that caused them to come out so strongly in the first place, I really feel like a fresh start would do a lot of good for me. 

I just can't get past the guilt of leaving my parents and being so far away in an emergency. And this is just the guilt in my own head. The guilt that they're going to throw on me will be so much worse. I could always get to them in under a day if I needed to, but because of my mom's fear of flying she would never come see me. So it'd be expected that I make regular trips back to see them - and the weekly contact issue would get even worse.

My house is a mess. I have poor time management. I'm exhausted. I live with my 19-year-old brother and 8-year-old daughter. I'm the sole breadwinner.

My brother lives with me and takes care of my kid for about three total hours each day. He takes her to school in the morning, a 20-minute walk, and then watches her for two hours before I get home from work.

Every day I come home to a dirty house. It's always a disaster. I work at a mentally exhausting job, and it's just the icing on the cake to come home to the scene of a national disaster every day.

If I want to eat or drink, I have to always wash something out. There's always clothes on the bathroom floor.

I hate being a tyrant. I don't want to feel like my brother's mom. I'm very appreciative of him for watching my daughter. I also pay for his cellphone because I don't want to not be able to contact him or vice versa while he's watching the kiddo.

Here's what I want: I want them to start cleaning up after themselves. His dirty dishes are driving me nuts, and it's not cool that he lets my kid tear up the living room while I'm at work.

I really feel like he couldn't give a shit less and doesn't appreciate what I'm giving him in return. Before he graduated high school, he lived in a very rural area and had no contact with his friends. Now he has a nice place to live in the more urban area, a cellphone, some spending money once in a while and only has to work two hours each day.

I want to treat him like an adult when broaching this topic, and I'm not sure how to. I need him very badly as I can't afford child care at all and I'm afraid of him just booking on me.

I realize this will take talking to the daughter, as well.

How do I go about this while respecting everybody?

My roommate is very strange, I'm sure he has issues but I don't know what. Basically, my roommate keeps his microwave dinner trash in the freezer after he is finished eating. It accumulates in there until he throws it out in the dumpster... I have tried speaking with him, and have written him two notes, to no avail. Today I received a note back stating that he has been doing this for 30 years and has never had a problem, and that he isn't going to stop.
For some extra information: I am 22 and he is probably 50 something. He's very strange... for example there are now eight different soaps in the bathroom soap holder, 7 of which have 1/4 left. They just keep piling up. He also likes to half finish cokes and then form a barrier around his food in the fridge with the bottles. I'm adding this because maybe someone can help me identify wtf his problem is so I can better deal with it.
Any ideas on what I can do to get him to stop putting his trash in the freezer would be great!!

**Edit #1:** Thanks for all the replies so far guys, it is helpful to hear from you. It does seem like he is a hoarder with some OCD tendancies, **has anybody had experience dealing with a hoarder? If so please share anything that might help, thanks!**

**Edit #2:** I just made an imgur account. If it helps I can post pictures of what I am talking about in a little under an hour when he has left for work.

**Edit #3:** Working on getting the pics taken.

**Edit #4:** Ok here are the pictures.
The soaps: Notice that they are alternating colors, g,b,g,b etc.

That's not a huge deal... but it's interesting.

**The Basement:** I only got one picture, this is maybe 1/10 of cans/bottles. Not to mention that there is a trashcan full of crushed cans and bottles, and I mean completely packed full. The second picture is of what he keeps drink wise in the house... that's about 1/3 of what is normally in here.
http://imgur.com/JJaw9  http://imgur.com/NWrLd
Again, not a huge deal, I've got clothes down there in a pile, w/e..

**The Couch:** he put a blanket, and several towels over his couch, and then topped it with soda carriers so that nobody can sit on it. I can get a better one probably, but this shows part of it.
http://imgur.com/UzSBJ
So yeah, weird right?

Now... the **TRASH:** I took it out so I could get a better picture of it. There were about 4 frozen dinners, an empty thing of deli turkey, some pizza sauces, a take home box full of crap, oh and the metal container? Yeah that's been in there for 2 MONTHS!! He also leaves chicken bones in there...

I don't know what to do, I really don't.

**Edit #5:** My dad spoke to him today (Saturday) and told him to either throw it away or get a mini freezer and put it in there. All my roommate had to say was that he would ""take care of it"" so we'll see what happens. Hopefully this will make life less nasty until I can move out or he does.

I need your help on a way to be happier.,20,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ec05a/ex_broke_up_with_me_15_years_ago_i_still_feel/,"It's the first time I'm telling the story from the beginning to end, so I hope writing this would help in some way. If you don't want to read the relationship background, you don't have to. I need help with my happiness.

Start of the story: 19 years old. I am 21 now.

**Relationship background**

From the beginning I warned her that I wouldn't be a good boyfriend because I didn't want to hurt her in the end. But she persisted and we got together. We loved each other very much.

We knew each other really well, connected well, and everything. However, when I told my mother about my new girlfriend, my mother said she didn't like her, and basically told me that I should break up with her. I did. This is because I was someone else back in the day, I couldn't think for myself, really. My mother is really controlling.

I broke up with my girlfriend, but then we got back together soon after. I kept our relationship a secret from my mother. Keeping a secret from my mother was one of the worst decisions I've ever made.

The secret was looming at the back of my mind. We saw each other less because of the guilt I had built up. I felt guilty of lying to my mother. But we kept on going with the relationship. We saw each other two or three times a week. Sometimes less than that. But we were texting/IMing all the time.

I would cut our time together, when we were out together, because I was trying to hide any suspicion from my mom. At the time, I thought my ex was OK with the way things are, seeing each other infrequently. I said I would one day tell my mother.

Eventually it broke, my ex told me the relationship was over. I asked why. I didn't know why it was ending; I was really blindsighted with how much this had affected her. I never knew. I knew, but I ignored it, I thought we could get through it. But she broke up with me after 11.5 months of being together.

Weeks later, I lose my job at a company I thought I had a chance with.

Fast forward 3 months from the breakup. It's the end of the summer, and my ex moves across the country to do school. We talk. We made up. We try doing the long distance relationship thing for a few months. It was OK, but it ended up not working out.

Then we break up again, for good. This break was clearly thought out logically between us. We decided that it would be in our best interests to not be together anymore at all. Because it hurt too much. We even explored me moving across the country for her. We part ways. She comes back to visit my city in the summer. We exchange our goodbyes one last time. Then it's over.

**Seeking happiness**

Fast forward to today. I've got a full time job that I love doing with a company I love working for. I get paid a lot. All should be well. I'm supposed to be happy and grateful for this. But I'm not. I'm still hurting from the relationship. I can't forgive myself. I really dislike who I am.

Everything I've done seems like to be a bandage that just falls off. I've tried new hobbies, doing things I love doing like playing video games and spending time with my friends. I've tried weed for a bit. These things are enjoyable for a while, but at the end of it all, I'm extremely unhappy. It feels like I'm in perpetual unhappiness. I've tried confiding in my friends, but it doesn't work. I've tried deep contemplation with myself. I don't know what else I could try.

I thought I was burned out from work. I tried taking a vacation, thinking things would iron itself out. It was fun, but it didn't help.

I'm trying to count my blessings, but it's really difficult when I don't like myself. I'm unhappy with who I am. How do you get out of something like this?

Reddit, I feel helpless, empty, and extremely unhappy. I need to be happier. I'm trying things. I need your help.

Or just general comments about how I've introduced them to better music or how they want me to come out with them that night or things like that. It's not as corny as I make it sound, but it seems like my friends really like having me around.

But for some reason, I'm terrible at meeting new people. When I meet someone new, I have a really hard time progressing past the small talk phase, and because of that, tend to keep to myself. Deep down, I have this feeling that I could be great friends with anyone. And they'd find me interesting and fun. But when I walk into a situation cold, without any sort of introduction, I don't know how to start a conversation.

I find this especially true with girls. 90% of the girls I've dated have come as a result of someone introducing them to me. I really have no ability to approach someone and get their number / ask them out on pure wit alone.

I have a pen that goes with my tablet (https://direct.wacom.com/stores/5/Intuos4_Grip_Pen_with_Stand_P1839C148.cfm), which is not exactly an ordinary $1 pen I can forget about losing. The pen was fat enough that I didn't think it would be able to fall into the space between the desk and the wall, but it did.  Here's a very rough diagram of what it looks like: http://img.skitch.com/20100823-pmmb64ucqg2qn1hkf7unx1w3w5.jpg

Every attempt at trying to stick some sticky tape or even super glue on a yardstick and trying to fish it out has been unsuccessful because the pen will fall off or it won't even stick. I don't have any of those arm-extension-grabby-tools that are small enough to fit in the space (maybe 1.5cm at the widest point since the desk is curved), they're all for way bigger things. Replacing the pen would cost a good amount, and moving the desk means a lot of pain and effort on my part that I'm not ready to do given the sheer amount of computer hardware I'd have to move. I can't just grab it from under the desk because there's solid wood walls that make up the drawers that are there right now, and it's flush with the wall on the edge facing me so I can't go that way either.

Basically, I need to grab a small but slightly hefty object through a 1.5cm-ish space from 2-3 feet up. Suggestions? My budget is pretty much up to whatever it costs to replace that pen (seems like $60ish).

I didn't have any friends so I gave her my number. She seemed ok, even though she talked a lot and was wearing a Twilight t-shirt. I got a weird vibe from her when there were some guys around (outside of school, inbetween classes), but I didn't know what it meant.

So she starts texting me asking if I wanna hang out, and we do. But the more time I spend with her, the more I realize she is obnoxious as hell. I never initiate our ""hanging out"" but I have a hard time saying no, and she has this way of asking that makes it difficult to turn her down.

She's one of those people who talks about weed constantly, bragging about how much weed she smokes all the time. She is always stoned to the point of stupidity when I run into her at school. She's one of those people who cannot hide it, at all. She is also creepily obsessed with Tommy Chong (often declares ""Chong for President"" and is very very serious). 

We have so little in common. I feel like screaming at her every time she talks because she just says stupid shit all the time. She has a very immature mentality when it comes to school (fight the man! fuck class!) When I run into her I treat her very indifferently, but she does stuff like hug me and pet my hair. I feel like I cold-shoulder her all the time.

But she still texts me saying ""Hey!! Let's have a girls night!"" (aka, I'm going to annoy the piss out of you for a few hours after class, and then crash on your couch because I don't have a ride home) and tries to come home with me after class.

She's one of those people who doesn't really get jokes, so she laughs throughout the whole thing, before you've gotten even close to the punchline. 

And remember that weird vibe I got from her about guys? Well this girl is so insecure, if there is another guy in the room, and she will literally block you with her body so that you can't get in their line of sight, and so she can dominate the conversation (which will inevitably be about how much weed she just smoked). She's incredibly possessive with guys, even ones who she barely knows. It's really creepy. 

I kept her around for a bit because I was new in town and I hoped she would introduce me to some people, but she only ever wants to come to my apartment and watch stupid internet videos and play the shittiest metal I've ever heard out of her phone, before sleeping on my couch. And also her friends have been really lame.

I know, I know, I'm just ranting and rambling at this point. I really do need advice.

How do I get rid of this girl? Hanging out with her is more of a pain than anything, and I really don't want people at school to think I'm some creepy Twilight shitty metal head stoner because she hangs around me all the time.

Is there any NICE way I can just stop being friends with her? Any less subtle (because subtle obviously isn't working) way I can make her take the hint?

(The irony of this being that she subscribes to the idea that too-sterile environments cause allergies in children.)

When I moved to my college dorm she insisted on wiping down every square inch of the dorm room with disinfectant wipes and did the same thing when I moved out. Ditto with our brand new car the day we drove it home from the dealership. Before every holiday trip she spends a day or two cleaning every last inch of the house. This isn't just a casual dusting, it's wiping down every floor, ceiling, chair, and tchotchke with soap and water. This also means that she comes into my room and wipes everything in here down too, so I can't hide anything.  

Last month Mom and Dad went on a trip and left me to house-sit, so the house was being occupied the whole time but she still cleaned everything before leaving. This coming weekend I have relatives coming to visit from overseas who are staying in our guest room for TWO DAYS before leaving on a road trip and my mom has spent the last three days staying up late and cleaning everything. Again.

Dad and I just kind of try to ignore it, but it does seem rather obsessive and it's gotten to the point where I can't wait for the semester to start so I can get far away from here (I'm going overseas for grad school). We've tried to confront Mom about it, but she also has a certain kind of passive-aggressiveness which means that she stubbornly refuses to admit to having any faults or making any mistakes and instead gets confrontational back at us and accusing us of being unreasonable and judgmental (when she's the one that's judgmental about literally everything). Dad has recently developed some serious insomnia and I'm worried about him. He suspects that it's all this stuff that's troubling him.

**TL;DR:** My mom is obsessed with cleaning the house and it's driving the rest of the family nuts.

About 2 weeks ago I lost my dad. Although we knew he had a heart condition, it was completely unexpected. He was given the clear by a doctor just 1 week before his death. Everything was supposed to be just fine. 

Then I got a call. The police 'had some bad news'. I rushed to my parents place, and found my father, dead in his bed, and my mom, completely freaked out. 

Of course, the first 2 to 3 days I/we cried a lot. I arranged the service myself and kept myself together to stabilize my mom. I wrote an awesome speech for the cremation, and I could even make jokes in it, and laugh/feel happy about the anecdote. 

Then ""normal life"" kicked in. Work, groceries, social stuff like parties/bars... Things that feel completely unchanged. The crying is gone, life continues as it was, and I am left with the weirdest feeling ever. 

Sometimes at work, my mind says: ""dude, your dad died"", and I'm like ""yup... can't change nothing 'bout that"", and then I end up kind of confused. 

When I look at a picture of my dad, my mind says: ""Looky, your dead father"", and i'm like ""indeed, the man on the pic was my father"". 

I don't feel sad in those moments, though I don't feel happy either. I'm just feeling nothing in particular... I'm not sure if my head accepted things too easy, or is not accepting things at all. 

""Fun"" things are just as fun as they used to be, work is still work. Everything is the same. I know I'm old enough to manage life without my dad, and I can't bring my dad back anyways. 

It's just like my mind doesn't really have an opinion on the whole situation. It's just like ""yeahh... so that happened."" 

Am I pushing things away? Is it a phase? What do?

I'm 17 years old, I have been living independently since I was 13 due to family problems. During this time I developed a death wish that I am so thankful never came true. I also did whatever drug and drank whatever alcohol was around, and smoked weed numerous times a day. I've been smoking cigarettes since I was about 12 years old. At one point in time I developed a slight eating problem [not quite a disorder] but I would only eat small meals at around 2 am, if I even stayed up until then. Otherwise, I wouldn't eat at all. Since I was 13 I have been in and out of doctors/psychiatrists offices, and have been diagnosed with several things such as: bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorder, ptsd, etc. I have gone each route with medications, and none seem to help me whatsoever. Today, it has been almost 4 months since I have smoked weed, and almost a month longer since I've done any other type of drug. Excluding alcohol that I drink VERY rarely and in small amounts. Now with my healthier lifestyle at hand; why am I starting to feel worse and worse? My head has drastically been getting cloudier and cloudier. More so in the last 3 weeks. So much that I feel like I'm dreaming, or I'm not really doing what I see myself doing. For example: when I go to the bathroom, I feel like I'm actually in bed and I had just wet the bed with my boyfriend next to me. Or when I'm walking around the house doing things, or answering calls at work, I feel like maybe I'm actually in a hospital bed and this is a dream. But then the fact that that is so far-fetched comes back, and I know that I'm ACTUALLY going to the bathroom, or answering calls. But noises echo in my head, I feel like I'm going to pass out, and the panic begins, and I have panic attacks at the worst I've ever seen in my lifetime: shaking, shallow breathing, almost in tears terrified. I have considered that maybe lack of sleep could be it. But even if I get 10 hours of sleep, it happens eventually during the day. [Typically at worst right before bed.] So I stopped drinking coffee/soda or taking anything that has caffeine/energy supplements in it. Thus far, this hasn't created much positive effect. Also, I've always eaten a healthy/proper diet. On that note, I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I need help and input and some ideas of where to research. [As if I haven't done enough of that already!] I also have a question if this sounds similar to anything with adhd [which I seem to have every symptom of as well.]

Unfortunately, the added stress took a toll on my academics, and what decent semesters previous became spiraled shit that engulfed all aspects of my present life. I went into a slight depression, and tried to get people to help. My professors were unresponsive, and when I decided to go to the academic deans, they too were unresponsive. To make matters worse, a dean told me that they could only do something it ""it looked like I was about to kill myself."" But that they couldn't help with my troubles otherwise.

So things were going great.

Toward the end of the semester, there were compounded complications concerning dorm housing as well as class scheduling, which then meant that my transient housing may soon also cease to exist. When I turned again to the academic deans, the response was not only unhelpful, but because of the impact everything had had on the semester's academics, I am now being forced to take a full year off to ""sort out my shit.""

That's right, in order to deal with homelessness, my university is telling me to go home. I hope they understand the irony.

Oh and because they're technically terminating my education for a period of time, I have to start paying off my student loans. And whatever scholarships I had will cease to exist when I return. My university is wonderful.

So now I have no home, no school, no money, and no real support.

So what do I do?

She stated that she had gone to the police, filed a report, and got a restraining order. However because she had felt so ashamed at the time she had waited too long and there was no physical evidence for the police to use against the guy who raped her.
    I fear that she is in constant danger now because of the police have not done anything to solve the issue. The guy who raped her has broken the restraining order several times, and he has even gone so far as to break into her house and trash everything. Every time that he breaks the restraining order she calls the cops but they have never showed up on time to catch the dirt-bag.
    I guess that my question is what should I / could I be doing to help Her. Part of me wants to go and beat the living hell out of the guy that did this to Her. However another part of me knows that doing such a thing wont accomplish much if anything at all. In fact it would probably get me thrown in jail while the rapist remains free.

# EDIT 1;
 Thanks for the advice I have read through it and many of the things that have been suggested are steps that she has already taken. She has been in counseling through the dove center for the last few months, and has made a great deal of progress. Also I have talked to her about installing a security system including cameras in the house; however she says at this point that she still does not want to do that. I am not entirely sure why but in the end it is her decision and not mine, so I will have to live with that for now. As for carrying a firearm I am not against the idea (I personally am trained in firearm use and carry one at all times) but I fear that she may not be in the state of mind to carry one. It would be my worst nightmare if I suggested this to her and she used the gun on herself. As for moving she has considered this as well but she fears that because we live in a semi small town that the move would be noticed and serve no good. She is currently living with our parents so at least she is usually not alone. Also as for the emergency kit that is a great idea and I will be sure to mention it to her tonight.
  In one final note / rant for this edit. It frustrates me to no end that the law enforcement, the people that are sworn to protect us have such an inability to do anything to help. I understand the need to have evidence and that you are innocent until proven guilty. But good hell the man broke into her home trashed the place, and the police tell us that no evidence was left. Per done my French but BULL SHIT. You can’t tell me that the idiot left on evidence at all, you can’t tell me that no one saw him come or leave. Seems to me that there is a complete lack of effort on the part of the police to investigate the matter.

It is convenient as they carry the things I want and I live in a semi rural location. The next nearest is six miles away.

 Within the last year, I have watched on at least 5 different occasions the staff handing out ""raffle packs"". These are simply promotional raffles i.e. an ice bucket, a fishing rod or some other low value item. The staff are allowing their friends fill out multiple entry forms. They keep these blank entry pads behind the counter to prevent such stuffing of the raffle box. One purchase one ticket. 

Last month they rolled a high dollar motor cycle into the business and offered it up as raffle item. Soon after on one of my visits I witnessed four guys all standing around the entry box with full pads of these tickets. One ran out while I was there and was offered another full pad. They were clearly friends of the cashiers. I mentioned nothing and finished my transaction and left. 

About a week later I was in at an unusual time and encountered the manager. I asked what their policy was with regards to the raffles and was confirmed one purchase one ticket. I reported that she may have a problem with some of the evening staff and told her what I witnessed I gave no identifying information as to whom was the problem staff. I left that for her discretion.

Last evening as I entered the store the two staff looked at me odd and started giggling. I heard them make reference to ""the girls"" as that is what I told the manager. ""The girls on the night shift"". All they have working there are females and in no way was this an identifying comment. After I selected my items and placed them on the counter I remembered my wife requested ice cream. I moved towards the freezer, which is next to the exit. Mid stride one says to the other ""Oh look he's leaving he can't even face us"" I picked out the ice cream and returned to the register only to be faced with the question about why I narked on them. 

This has put me in a shitty position of being uncomfortable shopping there. I really don't blame the night staff they are immature simple little people. I do blame the manager for identifying me. It seems to me unprofessional.

More Details inside, does anyone know this phenomena and know who might help me/what is wrong with me?",21,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1djrd3/in_the_last_month_i_had_several_recurring_short/,"Hello everyone,

Since my main account can be linked to me i opted for taking a throwaway for this. In the half year i have had 6-7 short psychological events that deeply disturbed me. They occur random and are usually happening this way:

* 30-40 seconds of a strong feeling that ""something is wrong""
* This is followed by a strange smell that i cannot identify. I sometimes think it smells like ""summer"" or a bbq but i can't identify it for sure. It also feels like my nostrils are irritated while i smell it
* for about 3 minutes i get a strong sensation of something along the line of fear and discomfort
* While this is happening i have strange thoughts and memory occuring that feel like remembering a dream that i had forgotten and i can never say if they are real memorys or memorys of dreams. After this is over i can't remember a thing i thought of.
* During all of this i feel a strong sense of disorientationand discomfort

I don't want to violate the reddit policy regarding medical advice so i just want to know if anyone has experienced something simmiliar or can identify the problem so i can find out if it's physical or psychological. To give you a little bit of background information here's what i can think of that might possibly be linked to it.

* i have had depressions for most of my teenage and young adult life (i am 21). I never saw a psychologist about it as i never felt it was beyond what i was able to deal with.
* i smoke a lot of weed, however i am not sure if there's a direct link between the occurences and times i smoked or didn't smoke as it is too rare to draw any conclusions
* i had a bad year so far, got kicked out of college, grandparents are dying but for the first time in my life the relationship to my parents has drastically improved due to the fact that after a long and very emotional discussion with my mother she had a breakthrough and significantly changed her behaviour and we work much better as a family now than we ever did before. 
* I'm not in a good shape physically (though not hopelessly fat ) 

Does this match anything you know of be it physical or psychological as i don't even know where to start researching or wether i should go to a psychologist or a doctor about this. I can't trigger these events in any way i know of and their appearence seems utterly random to me.

every input is very much appreciated!

He doesn't work, leeches off of what little money my sister makes, leeches off of my dad, treats her kids like shit, and I'm pretty sure he's getting her back into drugs.

Basically, I stopped attending two of my four classes. One was Calculus I, which I contemplated dropping because I was struggling with the material. Since I desired to drop the class, I decided to stop showing up. Eventually I learned that if I dropped the class, I would no longer be considered a full-time student, and thus my financial aid would be affected. By this time, however, I had missed a couple weeks of the class, including one exam. This, combined with laziness, procrastination, and a failure to fully understand the consequences of my actions, led me to stop showing up for the class for the rest of the semester. I also stopped attending my Psychology class (also out of laziness and procrastination), though I still showed up for its exams. As you can imagine, I failed both of the classes I skipped. However, I kept attending my two other classes, and I passed both of them.

I have now been placed on academic suspension for one semester, because my GPA was below 1.0. Thus, I am unable to attend the spring 2013 semester at my school.

My freshman year of college went relatively well. I passed all of my classes in those two semesters without much struggle. However, I was briefly placed on academic suspension in my first semester that year because I forgot to pay my financial aid on time (fortunately I was able to quickly rectify that problem and return to class).

I have some personal issues that affected my performance and actions this semester. There has been some strife in my family, which both annoyed me and left me stressful and anxious. I procrastinate on a regular basis. I'm quite shy and socially awkward, so I'm reluctant to seek help from other people. I have a part-time job, which offers me social experience and an escape from the rigors of school and my life at home. The thing is I had all of these issues during my freshman year, yet I attended and passed my classes back then. I'm not sure why this semester ended up so different.

I'm trying to set up an appointment with my academic advisor to discuss my suspension and what actions I should take. I'm also considering to appeal my suspension, though I doubt I have a strong case. I failed two classes because I skipped them, and I skipped them because of laziness and procrastination. I fully deserve this suspension. It's the rightful consequence of the poor choices I made.

What to do about parents?",23,7,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/14adkg/first_semester_in_college_failing_at_least_two/,"Ok, first a little bit of background. I am an only child, 19, and live with my parents. I am currently attending my first semester at a two-year school (plan to transfer to a four-year school after this school). I did fairly well in high school.

One of my biggest issues/habits is that I do not ask for help when I need it. I have done this many times over the years, in both middle school as well as high school. If I am doing poorly in a class, instead of asking my parents for help or even just telling them what is going on, I lie about it. It is almost like I try to pretend it isn't there. I am afraid of being scolded (my mother always told me that when I was little, all she had to do was look at me sternly and I would cry/fess up). I know this is a huge problem for me, and have gotten through it in the past. But I am now in my first semester of college, an entirely new environment, and I fell back to my old habit.

I am probably not the first college freshman to fall victim to the new freedom that comes with college. I stayed out later, didn't always go to class, and procrastinated until the last minute. I completely understand why and how I am failing my classes. I know what I need to do differently and am planning to change things around drastically next semester. But if I told my parents I failed, I would never hear the end of it. Especially since whenever they asked me about school and my grades, I always said I was doing fine. Being an only child that still has to ask for permission to do just about anything, I know what would happen. They would take away any freedom I have left. I am not going to let that happen. But how do I keep them from finding out?

Don't get me wrong, I feel terribly guilty about the entire thing, but I know the repercussion is not worth it. 

I know that legally they can't ask for my grades, but is there any way that they can find out? They paid out of pocket (dad didn't do FAFSA and I didn't get any scholarships). 

Please do not lecture me about how I am handling this. I may only be 19, but I had to grow up quickly due to family issues (not important, message me if you must know). 

**TL;DR** Failing most of my college classes, am going to keep it from parents who are paying out of pocket, need advice on how to keep them from knowing.",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_14adkg,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/14adkg/first_semester_in_college_failing_at_least_two/,
1353546051.0,17,self.needadvice,13lhy7,"I hate my father, and I'm not sure what to do about it",22,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/13lhy7/i_hate_my_father_and_im_not_sure_what_to_do_about/,"I've had on and off periods of hatred for my father, but, ever since I got to college, how often and how strongly I hate my dad has been growing. It's for several reasons:

* **He made me play tennis for most of my childhood.** I hated tennis. I hated drilling to get better. I hated going to tournaments, losing, and getting scolded. I hated getting made fun of by the other people on the team because I wasn't as good as them. If I stopped playing, he would get livid. He'd be angry constantly. He'd tell me I had made the biggest mistake of my life and tell me how disappointed he was in me. He'd start screaming at me about 50% of the time he took me out to practice, but when I stopped playing my junior year in high school he would be mad at me CONSTANTLY. The most frustrating part was that he took responsibility for being my coach, but he sucked. Not just in tennis skills, but in knowing how to win and improve as a player. To this day, I have NEVER gotten a straight answer as to why he made me play this fucking sport.

* **He emasculates me constantly.** He'd threaten to beat the shit out of me. He'd get in my face, put his fists up, grab me by the collar, push me, grab me, stuff like that. He'd yell as loud as he could all the time. I never got a true beating, just slaps really. But the fear of always getting the shit kicked out of me by someone much bigger than me always scared me senseless. Even now, when we're the same height, I just see him as a much bigger person totally capable of ending my life.

* **He guilt trips me.** I would get blamed for a ton of things that were, looking back, absolutely not my fault. Ex. he'd be upset at me for not practicing tennis enough, get in a fight with my mom, and then say ""See what you did to your mother you little prick?"" The other day, him and my mom were getting into a fight while I was visiting home (15min away from me). I told him I was going to go back to my dorm because I didn't want to be there while they were arguing. In response, he said ""You're going to regret making your parents suffer so much."" tl;dr: he'd get angry for no good reason, and blame me for making him act in ways he knew were bad.

* **He uses my mom as a hostage.** I've told him to fuck off a few times, and, every time I do, he makes my mom's life a living hell. If I try to call her on her cell phone, he'll wrestle the phone away from her, tell me how upset she is with me, and unload on me verbally until I hang up. She doesn't have the strength to deal with his temper, even though she's a lot smarter than him.

* **He demands apologies all the time.** Nothing much more to say here. For the bullshit listed above, he demands apologies.

What keeps me coming back to this relationship, I think, is how much he loves me, or claims to. My sister and my mother tell me how unreasonable I'm being when I don't make amends with him. But I'm tired of it. I don't want to walk on eggshells with my father, or anyone.

I knew I wanted to go into computer science at a very early age, and, even though my father didn't give a shit, I pursued it when I went into college. I'm getting great grades at a great college, and I'm already getting job offers with very good pay. I don't see what benefits I can get from maintaining a relationship with my father that I couldn't earn on my own. The only thing that keeps me from not talking to him is how badly he treats my mother when I do.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking for. I hate him. I don't want to talk to him. I want to forget he ever existed. But I can't because my mom will NEVER separate from him.

1349020653.0,15,self.needadvice,10pp94,Gas bill is $1600 for last month. I didn't use any of it! What can I do?,24,9,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/10pp94/gas_bill_is_1600_for_last_month_i_didnt_use_any/,"I moved into a new house 2 years ago. The house is mostly gas - the stove, water heater, furnace, fireplace, and dryer. Since I'm down south, the heating bill is low to non-existent. I looked through the last 6 months and the gas bill (propane) was anywhere from $60 to $90/mo. During the winter last year I went up to $190.

Just to give you an idea, in April, my bill said Beginning reading 567, ending reading 630. 63 units used (I think it's cu ft). $72 due.

In May, beginning reading 630, ending 687. 57 units used. $63 due.

**In Aug, I received a bill for $465**. Beginning reading 796, ending 1196. I called up the gas company and asked them WTF was going on. The lady looked over the records and said ""ohhh. I see what they did. We'll fix it"". I then asked what I owed, and she said they would call me when they corrected it.

OK cool. That's settled. A few weeks later I get a new bill. I think it's the corrected amount. **Instead, it's for $1643**. Beginning reading 1196, ending reading 2191. Bill is $1157, plus the previous amount that I hadn't paid.

So I call up and freak out on the phone. The lady on the phone said she understood why I'd be upset and she would have someone else fix it for me, then call me back. The following week I call and she said they were working on it. I call one more time and still no answer, and no detail on what I actually owe. 

I was upset because this gas company (**AmeriGas**) also charges $10 to read the meter on the side of the house. Every house in the neighborhood has a meter. You wouldn't think they would charge this... so I was upset they're charging me $10/mo to read the meter and then give me inaccurate results!

This morning I went out to the side of the house to see what the meter actually says. The gauge says: 21936, with a 0 (static number) at the very end. Cubic feet. 

My previous bill was dated 20 days ago. The reading 20 days ago was 2191, so it sounds like I've only used 2 cubic feet in 20 days? That seems too low considering my typical bill is around 2 per day. 

Long story short, the gas company kept telling me the issue was clerical, not to worry, they've procrastinated for almost two months without telling me what the situation is, and meanwhile it appears that the gas readings on my bill match up, and they're making a massive profit off me that they wouldn't have otherwise had. If there is a gas leak, they should have fixed it or told me about it. Last year we thought the garage smelled like gas, and we called AmeriGas. The tech couldn't find any leak, so they charged me $250 for the call. They literally punish consumers who report leaks.

I don't know what to make of this situation and I don't want to pay the $1600. That bill is larger than I would spend on gas for an entire year!

WTF can I do?


**UPDATE**: I called this morning and they claimed the meter rolled over at 995, they usually automatically adjust but she can't make the changes and they're processing it. She can't tell me what I owe but she said they'll adjust the last two months. I can't figure out why there is a roll over at 995 when the meter clearly goes way above that. If it rolls over at 995, and my last two bills are:

Beginning reading 796, ending 1196.
Beginning reading 1196, ending reading 2191

- i think i'm an ambivert (mid way between extrovert and introvert). i tend to spend more time alone and i often do well on my own. but i can be very outgoing and i am very well liked by the people around me.

- i feel as though a good half of my passions have been chosen by myself rather than being found. and the things i DO really enjoy doing often get pushed aside by the fact that for whatever reason being it money or location or people, I can't participate in said activities.

- i feel like i'm being an asshole to many people, but at the same time i feel like it's the only way i've gotten many of the things i want. i am naturally very giving and kind but in the past that ended up with me being used by most of the people that were around me. and i ended up getting nothing out of it.

- i feel fairly disconnected from my friends, part of it being like i said before. i do get along really well with them but i don't feel a deep connection with anyone and i've had a growing feeling that i would do better off alone somewhere else. 
for example last night as with most friday nights i got together with my usual group of friends which including me is about 5 people which ended up (as usual) in 3 seperate smaller groups. 2 sets of closer friends and me.

I know that's bad, but my boss was more than happy to put me on. In the months leading up to the opening, I attended every meeting, every course required for me to take and have always been polite to all my coworkers and my boss.

I was given a permanent position in the shop and after working two days I had two days off (at this time there was no roster, we were called the night before to confirm whether or not we'd be working) when my aunt (who also works here) called my grandma to pass along the message I was fired because I'm slow and unmotivated and I got water on the floor when I used the dishwasher. She calls my boss, and he confirms, repeating that I got the floor wet and I don't mop fast enough.

I was extremely upset after waiting for months, spending so much money on work clothes and courses to be fired after two days and not even directly. So I went to the shop to confront him myself, basically saying what I'd just written, and that if I had done anything wrong (spilling water, which EVERYONE does, which I cleaned up) then it would make more sense to tell me at the time, instead of saying I did a great job and then firing me later.

He says no one ever said anything about the way I mopped or anything about the way I worked because we've all been so busy. Basically just feigning innocence as I caught him off guard, and I can come back in a month (even though he just said I hadn't done anything wrong?), but whatever, I said sure.

Anyway I don't want to make this too long because I need help... My aunt's daughter has my job now and I'm being harassed by her for mentioning the email confirming my permanent position.

1333393500.0,16,self.needadvice,rpwis,24 year old college student struggling with ADHD,19,3,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/rpwis/24_year_old_college_student_struggling_with_adhd/,"I know, I know, this is probably the *worst* website I could be on.

I think I fit the bill of your typical smart lazy student. I glided through high school on a bare minimum effort, failed some classes out of apathy and got straight As in just about anything I had a mild interest in. Finished just shy of a 3.0 GPA. I got worse in college. Year one was fine, until I realized I had no incentive to go to my classes. Over the next couple of years, I've come close to flunking out entirely. I've been suspended once for a semester, and lost my financial aid finishing the semester after that. For about a year I paid my way (by working at Taco Bell) through one class at a time while going to the school's psychology clinic for some help (they were the ones who diagnosed me, ADHD PI, or ADD)... And it did, at least to a degree. I managed to get myself a little more organized, but I had a hard time getting any of their planning strategies up. I got my financial aid back, went back to school, and they seemed to think I was ready to go it alone... Trying as hard as I could muster, and trying to keep to everything I could organized, I really scraped by on the skin of my teeth. Two C's, a B and a D. Calculus was rough.

This semester has been worse. I've been sick, I had to move, got into a fight with my brother in law that almost lead to a legal battle, and to top all of that I'm taking the hardest classes I ever have. The bright side is that I actually feel challenged in my classes for once. The downside is that I've missed a lot of class, and anxiety is really piling up. I've been skipping out of fear of reprisal. I haven't met with a partner for a huge class project in weeks because I feel afraid to talk to him.

As for symptoms: I can't listen to lectures. I've tried. Even when I'm interested I'll zone out. Textbooks are better, but almost as bad. I have difficulty focusing at work (I have a desk job now). All the time I waste on Reddit or some other site could probably be attributed to regular laziness, but sometimes I'll be just staring at HTML and I'll blank, or start daydreaming, or just focus on nothing. I'll lose entire days of work at a time. I think I have anxiety issues, though the clinic didn't seem to think so. I'm afraid to go to my classes because I haven't been going to my classes. I think I had a mild panic attack this past Friday in one of my classes. I just couldn't stand to be in the room. I left early without saying anything.  I've even lied to my fiancee about a few classes because of how I know she will react... 

For less serious problems - I forget the simplest of things. all the time. Things, appointments, people... I'm always forgetting where my coffee is, or that the pot is still on, I'll forget to pay bills until I receive an overdue notice, I'll forget about homework I was supposed to do, I'll forget I was supposed to give someone a ride. I forgot to make a reservation for me and my girlfriend for our fifth anniversary. Turned out nearly every restaurant we wanted to go to were closed that night. That turned into one of the biggest fights we've ever had. 

I'm an absolute slob. I can't finish anything I start - no matter how enthusiastic I am when I start. I lose myself when I'm in the middle of a conversation. My fiancee accuses me of not paying attention to her when she talks, but the truth is I can't seem to help zoning out. The best that I can do is ask her to repeat herself - ad nauseum. I tend to be oblivious to things right in front of my face. I tend to have to have obvious things pointed out to me. My mother likes to rib me about how she managed to wrap my Christmas presents one year while I was in the room watching TV. She made no attempts to conceal herself. I had no clue.

I'm sorry, this has turned into a diatribe... I guess I just can't stand this. I feel like I can't keep my mind in the world I live in.

So what should I do? I feel like the clinic didn't help. I don't feel entirely comfortable with the idea of prescription drugs, but I'm to the point that I'm willing to try them. Or am I really just that much of a lazy asshole?

When I was eighteen years old, right after graduating high school, I was kicked out of my home. My older sister by three years was in a serious relationship with someone my parents did not agree with due to the fact that he was from Iraq. My parents are both from Arkansas, both of religious nature and my father has served almost twenty-five years in the U.S Army. Her boyfriend never had a chance. Well, seeing how they had been dating for some time and I had gotten to know him...I supported the relationship fully. Refusing to break up with him and outraged at my views, my sister and I were forced to get an apartment of our own. 

We both worked at a call center, forty hours a week to help with bills but I had no time to go to college and no help to even try. A few months down the road my sister leaves me with bills up to my eyeballs because she had been hoarding the money to pay for her to move to Canada and live with her boyfriend. (Over the time they had dated, he moved from BC to the Toronto area. We live in Washington so the relationship was semi-long distance at the start but it got harder once he moved.) I trusted her enough that she handled most of the bills, I had NO idea this was happening. 

So, she left.  She got married. She's happily living out her dream as a housewife. 

I on the other hand struggled to pay off those bills and moved into my parents house so I wouldn't be homeless. I couldn't afford the apartment by myself. After three months of verbal abuse and screaming, I moved in with my boyfriend of seven months. Which...granted...was not smart. 

After a week...I found him with our roommate straddling him. On our bed. 

With no where else to go I stayed with him. A few months of back and forth emotional torture...I have once again moved back into my parents home. The rules are harsh but after some family counseling things have gotten much better between us. 

All of this has been in the past two years or so. I just turned twenty a few months ago and I'm really trying to get into college. I attended spring quarter at my local community college and walked out with a 3.8. 

Here's the where things get...more difficult. My parents will only house me if I'm attending college but they refuse to help pay for my tuition. I have been trying like mad to get a job but it hasn't happened. I've even resorted to selling my things to try to raise money for Fall Quarter. If I'm not going to class by mid-September...

But I need some advice on to what to do about my boss.",20,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/i2uf2/im_submitting_this_at_the_wrong_time_so_nobody/,"I'm going to start this off by saying I work in a porn shop. Which is probably the reason that things are really lax around my workplace. 

However, my boss is driving me crazy, and is causing me a -lot- of stress. Right now, some higher ups in the business are making a case to try to get him fired. He's been suspected of stealing money and product, and putting the blame on employees. However, I don't know if I can stand to wait until it happens. 

He often yells at people for things that aren't their fault. For example, the other day, we were out of bags at the start of the shift. I called to let him know (He's not there in the evenings, when I work.) and he yelled at me for 20 minutes about how we don't let him know when things need restocking, even though it was my first night there **all week**. He pulls shit like this all the time. He's yelled at clerks for lesser things. He also tends to say and do things that are incredibly unprofessional. (he takes 2-hour lunch breaks, and leaves early. He once told me he was ""keeping an eye on me, because I'm the rogue"", but wouldn't tell me why, and said he wanted to 'see the look on my face' when he explained it.) He hears things over the camera microphones, and takes them out of context. (He thought a regular/friend of the store was an employee's boyfriend because they went out to a club once with some other coworkers. Wtf?)

And today, I found out he was gossiping with a co-worker and making fun of me. Last week I was working on days with my boss and another coworker. (I'm almost always on nights.) And I have an IUD, and it makes my vag susceptible to infection. I was running to the bathroom every hour or so to take care of it and apply some anti-itch cream. I let my co-worker know what was going on, so she didn't think I was ditching her to do all the work. Of course my boss overhears this. (He has mics set up so he can listen to us in his office. This was during the week I was working with them.) Today, I learned from another coworker (Who I'm good friends with.) that they were making fun of me for it during the week she was working. I was devistated, embarrased, and ashamed. However, I don't want to take it to the higher-ups because A) I only have the word of a coworker to go off of, and B) I don't want to get the other girl fired. She's got a kid, and needs the job.

Between the bullshit my boss pulls, the fact he's been tense because he knows people are making a case against him, and the fact that they were gossiping and apparently think I'm ""gross"", it makes me want to walk out of my job. I'm trying to save up to move back home though. (I live in the midwest. I'm from the northwest.) I'm getting fed up, and I'm not sure how much more I can take. I don't think I'd be able to find a job with the same hours and pay as I get there. Its $9/hr, at almost 40/hrs week, depending on the week. Plus bonuses. Its great pay. But the job is driving me crazy.

I'm aware that part of it may be me getting cabin-fever. Whenever I'm stuck in the same routine for months, I have a bad habit of doing something drastic and changing it up. (Like a job or home change.) But its been so stressful I wonder if its not only cabin-fever, but also just getting tired with dealing with the crap at my job. 
 
**tl;dr: Boss acts incredibly unprofessional, and higher-ups are trying to get him fired. However, this is making his mood more sour and making him more likely to blow up at employees.

Without wanting to reveal too much personal information about him on the internet, he's had a number of traumatic things happen to him/repressed things from his childhood that have finally come to the surface/things he's found out about said traumatic events/family issues in the last two weeks or so. Additionally, his mother passed away a few months ago. 

It started off gradually a couple weeks ago, all of a sudden he was really into numerology, and became convinced that he had discovered a miscalculation in Pi due to a rounding error on google's calculator, and convinced himself that this was the key to making millions off of FOREX trades. He's been frantically scribbling numbers on paper that make absolutely no sense. It was bizarre, but prior to this he had seemed to be a perfectly sane, very intelligent college student. It then started to degrade a bit further, he started to sporadically mention things like evil represented in the Forex currency charts, but only occasionally. I suggested that he seek out a therapist, which he said he would, but he never actually acted on it.

Things continued to get worse, a conflict between him and my other roommate erupted a few days ago, and a few nights ago he ran away, sent me a good 25+ pages of semi-coherent text messages and said he would not sleep in our house anymore, instead opting to sleep on benches at the college campus we attend a few blocks away. I hunted him down and convinced him to come home. The next day, things seemed to be getting better. He was no longer spouting crazy shit, but he was obsessively watching forex charts from dawn to dusk. 

Then last night happened. ~~He received a phone call about a relative of his having committed suicide, possibly (probably) related to some things he (my roommate) opened up to his family about.~~ Edit: Not actually what happened. We think his grandfather may have died...? This pushed him completely over the edge. He's been in an inactive chat room to a political radio network essentially talking to himself since midnight last night (15 hours). He's convinced that the radio shows are responding to him, even though they're all recorded from a previous date. He's been pretty silent, chain smoking at least 6 packs of cigarettes last night, but I've been idling in the chat he's in. From what I gather, both from the chat and the few things he's said it seems he thinks the Forex brokers are after him and his family, and that they may have [kidnapped, I guess?] a member of his family, and he wants them to take him instead. 'In blood', and those sort of things. He keeps talking about Forex being the 'ultimate evil'. Add in biblical ramblings (though he was a devout atheist..), lots of random numbers, mathematical signs, and Ayn Rand references.

I'm fairly sure at this point that he needs to be hospitalized, but I don't know how I'm going to get him there. I can't even get him to go to sleep or leave the computer. He is estranged from most of his family, hold his stepfather, who kicked him out a couple months ago after a huge drama. I know I should contact him, but I'm afraid it would infuriate my roommate. What do I do?

Sorry if this post is a little incoherent, I didn't sleep last night, as I wanted to keep an eye on him.

My wife and I are in our early 30s, married for only 3 years and we don't have kids. I would like to have kids one day, but I'm not sure my wife does anymore. That's a topic for another day. Our biggest problem right now is that we basically have no friends and we've fallen into the pattern of just going to work, eating dinner, walking the dogs and then watching tv every night. Our marriage is strong and not in danger or anything, but I just hate being in this rut with nothing to do every night and no real friends to do anything with. The winter weather doesn't help matters.

We moved away from the city to a medium sized college town in the north 3 years ago because we couldn't stand the traffic, smog, crime, etc. Most of our friends from college had moved away already anyway and we're not especially close to our families, so we weren't leaving that much behind.

She works in the town 25 miles from here so anyone she meets there aren't really great candidates for friendship because they're not willing to ever drive to meet up, most of them have kids anyway. I am a teacher and mostly work with middle aged or older women with kids. So meeting friends at work isn't really an option that has been working out for us.

It seems like the only things geared toward people our age are things related to people with kids. Everything else in this town is focused on the college aged crowd. A lot of the people that live here have always lived here and grew up with their friends, so breaking into their circles can be tough.

Any suggestions on how to make friends when you've just moved and are in our situation would be great. But we'd also like any ideas about things that we could do just the two of us on a weeknight that are relatively cheap and could maybe spice up our lives a bit.

Things we already do: Walking the neighborhood with the dogs, hiking, stickering/guerilla art projects, video games, puzzles.

We have a two-year-old son whom I love more than anything.  I've never smoked in front of him, and I've mostly reserved getting stoned for late at night after he's gone to bed.  Occasionally though, I have gotten high with friends after work, before coming home.  Also, there have been a couple times where I've smoked a little bit on my days off while he was down for a nap and my wife is away at class.

This last week, my wife exploded on me and got really upset that I would be stoned around our son.  She thinks I have a problem, and that I need help to stop.  

This is a difficult thing to hear, I live in the Northwest where pot is pretty socially accepted and the use of it has become so casual to me that I'm having a hard time seeing her perspective.  No one wants to be called a drug addict, especially when their drug of choice is fairly benign.

Reddit, what should I do?  I like smoking marijuana, but I'm beginning to see that the choices I make regarding pot are not good ones.  It's been so long since I haven't regularly used it, that I'm terrified of not having it.  I'm a naturally anxious person, and smoking helps to calm my nerves.

Any thoughts?

I've tried to stop saying the word fag, and calling things gay (""lame"" is a good substitute,) and to note when people are insensitive to things like that, so that if I ever get the huge amount of courage I might change their mind.

Within the past few months things have gotten far worse than they ever have. My emotional state has lead to major relationship problems and diminishing performance at work (I'm a creative director for a start up).

Things hit rock bottom on Monday evening. I had a complete meltdown, the likes of which I had never been through before. It took me a couple hours to calm down. It was bad enough that I considered checking myself in to a mental ward.

Luckily, my SO… even though we are having major problems… recommended that I get to a local out-patient facility she had heard about as soon as I could.

I did my bet to maintain the next day, put in a couple hours at work, and then went to the facility. They couldn't see me that day, so I went the next morning. They were very thorough and ended up giving me Klonopin and Celexa.

I also heard back from the therapist I had contacted a couple days before (even before the meltdown) and I start Tuesday evening. Although I haven't seen this *particular* therapist before, i've been to this outfit, and they are all exceptionally good therapists.

So… I've got the meds (the Klonopin is just temporary until the Celexa stats to have an effect, btw) and already am feeling much calmer and not like I'm about to flip out at any given moment, I'll have two therapy sessions before I go back to work, and the SO and I are trying to reconnect (although… not in the best of conditions (she's seeing other people).

I have a list of things I need to get done, mostly these are practical things that I've kind of let fall behind (domestic stuff, some paper work type things, maybe an art project or painting the apartment, etc.)

But I really feel like I should maximize the self care.

There are some *major* change I really need to make, both with my personal relationships (familial, romantic, and friendly) and with my motivation, organization, and concentration with work.

I know that there's no way at all I can have everything just pop into place within two weeks, but I want to make sure that I use that time to get myself on a solid foundation of growth. I don't want to just ""keep myself busy.""

Her daughter is a 17 year old who does talk back and can be an asshole, but overall she is a good kid; good grades, has a job, doesn't do drugs, isn't caught up in boys, getting a scholarship to college through softball etc. 

Back in December her daughter lied about where and with who she was going to the mall, and her mom found out she went to the mall with a boy.  When she got home, her mom hit her, started swinging a bat and ended up falling on her and the ambulance ended had to come.  Her mom started crying and begging her not to tell the police what happened or else her little sister and brother would get taken away, so she didn't.

Since then, things have been worse; the mom calls her daughter a ho, a slut, threatens to call her school and get her kicked out, threatens to call the police on her for disrespecting her, threatens to make her lose her job and scholarship etc.  

I have gotten close with the 17 year old as when her and her mom fight, she comes over and just hangs out and watches garbage tv, does a puzzle or something lame with my husband, we talk etc. and her mom has decided to no longer take her to school, so I have been doing that since February.

This past week, they got into another fight and this time the 17 year old fought back and so the mom was going to call the police on her.  The 17 year old said she was running away, the mom said she would have the police pick her up at school or work and she would go to Juvenile hall, lose her scholarship etc.  The girl is scared and is worried that her mom is literally going to ruin her life.

I talked to the girl over the weekend and we decided that on Sunday when her mom was at church, we'd pack all her shit up and take her to her grandma's house to live.  Her family knows that her mom is abusing her, but her mom is constantly threatening to call the police if anyone takes her in as ""harboring a runaway"" or some shit.

I told the daughter to let her mom call the police but let her mom know that she would be talking to them too and telling them about what really happened in December, what happened last week as well as photographic proof of bruises and the abuse in text messages.  

Obviously the mom is pissed now and feels I betrayed her because I am an adult and should be on her side, and I'm taking her daughter's side etc.  I told her point blank, her daughter was going to run away to a stranger and I don't want that and I don't want CPS being called so I got her daughter to a safe home.

The grandparents are good people, they are older obviously but they could use the help of a 17 year old around the house.

Long story short, I helped my neighbor's daughter who was being abused by her mother to move to her grandma's home (2miles away) and now her mom is pissed.  I feel like I did the right thing, I know it was kind of shady to take someone's kid like that but I just wanted that girl somewhere safe without calling the police.

Her mom is playing the victim, saying how she isn't a bad mom, this isn't fair, how it was only a handful of fights, how her daughter talks back, how it's legal to ""whoop"" your child, how her daughter is now going to get pregnant living with her grandparents, how she is going to get into drugs etc.  I told her I'm sorry she is upset, but I was not going to watch her 17 year old run away and end up God knows where and ruin her future as well as be put down and beat up, or have her other two small kids watch/hear the abuse.  She doesn't get it. 

I haven't talked to the mom since yesterday, should I engage with her or just let it be?

Nothing outrageous, just a telesales job, a bar and a day care centre. I just wanted to be given a chance at an interview.

The I actually got the interview! And with all the interview techniques I had read, it went ok. When the guy wanted to see if I could do what was required he was impressed and gave me the job! 

But that all came crashing down on my first day today. He asked me to provide email references from previous employers. I have none and I don’t know what to say to him when I go to work in 7 hours.

I now regret being deceitful on my resume, but I had become so desperate. 

I've considered setting up an email domain relevant to my previous jobs but I don't have the money (flat broke) or enough time. Please help if you know any way I could fix this.

TL;DR After many years I got my first job, with real skills but a false resume. On first day my new boss asks me for references but I have none.

So, my brother asked for some advice. He wanted to take some pictures on his computer and put them up on dropbox. I said, sure I'll tell you how to do it, and then I tell him how to do it. What he wants to do, is put those pictures on dropbox and then delete them from his computer, to save space. So, he set up the dropbox and put stuff in the folder, like I told him, and now he asks me what to do from there. I told him that he could just uninstall dropbox and delete the folder, since he doesn't want the stuff on his computer anyways and now it's on the dropbox website. He then wants to know how do redownload stuff again, and I try to show him, but he wants to get a specific thing, and I tell him it's okay, just click anything because I just want to show him how to redownload in a general manner for everything, but he didn't want to do anything until he looked for a specific thing, so I got impatient and we got in an argument.

I could justify and come up with excuses, like how I was right to feel impatient or how he said some mean things, but I should have been patient and wait for him to look for whatever it was he was looking for, which wasn't even there anyways. 

This happens a lot, and every time I tell myself I'm just going to avoid conflicts like this because I feel like crying every damned time I get into an argument because I hate how I act in them. But when you're in the moment, you never expect to get into an argument, of course. You expect: 

""Hey, let me show you the general way to do it""
 
""Ok. By the way, I'm looking for something"" 

""What were you looking for?""

So I guess you just keep pushing in the hopes that the conversation will eventually turn into that, but it doesn't. Maybe I'm a narcissist. I expect things to go my way, and when it doesn't, I get confrontational and impatient? I feel like an idiot. Now the rest of my family sees me as overly complicated. My father even said stop being complicated, and they were all on his side, so of course I'm the one in the wrong here. I'd like to think I was right, but I'm not. What if I'm like this to someone else? Maybe I am and they just keep their mouths shut to avoid confrontation, and let me continue with this behavior.

I feel even worse because now I'm self-doubting my own damed guilt. What if me feeling like this is just another way to save face? Maybe I get upset act all pouty and then continue on acting the same way without ever learning how to change my attitude. Maybe I'm wording my post to make me sound more sympathetic, and so on. I hate that too.

Is there any easy way to stop being an asshole? I try to not be like one, but it's not like I intended the argument to go that way, but I certainly didn't help to resolve the situation.

I got to the last round of interviews, and was in the HR round of formalities. They asked for my last pay-cheque from the older company. I tried to talk my way out of it, but they insisted that it was their HR policy and not something that was negotiable. *I should have stuck to my guns, seeing as I was perfectly qualified for the job and the pay-package that came with it.* However, they dropped all communication after they saw my pay slip and after two weeks sent me a rejection letter with no additional info.

Head-hunters for other positions do request data on the last pay-packet and I've seen communication die once they see what I used to earn. A friend told me that HR managers do not condone high pay-scale jumps (100% or more) and would much rather throw that candidate's file away. Is this true?

If this is true, what do I do? How can I get back on track pay-packet wise? As far as I understand, there is nothing glaringly wrong with my job profile. If possible, I would appreciate any expert HR advice on my profile and what I could do to get out of this rut.

I am a 23 year old in college. I live at my parent's home currently. My brother and my sister both have autism spectrum disorders, my 28 year old brother having Asperger's and my 26 year old sister having lower functioning autism. My Dad is 66 and my mom 68 years old, both retired. Both of my parents take care of my siblings full-time.

My sister has unfortunately had serious anger management issues for over 10 years now. On a regular basis, she gets violently angry for unreasonable and sometimes obscure reasons. The frequency of her anger outbursts changes over time, but usually it happens nearly every day. Dealing with this has had a profound effect on how our family operates and has operated for the last decade.

The amount of stress this has placed on my parents (as well as from other reasons) has been perhaps too much for one couple to handle. My mother tends to be very forgetful, emotionally drained, and depressed much of the time; my father tends to be very impatient, cold, and antagonistic, especially when dealing with my mother.

My mother being a bit scatterbrained has built up resentment in my father towards her. He wants her to do what he wants her to do, and when she makes a mistake/doesn't do it, he is very hard on her in terms of his scrutiny, complaining, and making demands. My mother is codependent, she strives to always do what my father wants and make him happy. When she is unable to please my father, or when he becomes mean or cold to her, she has a very difficult time handling it emotionally. She becomes so stressed that she will be unable to focus on things and will forgetful enough that she'll ask someone a question and forget their answer to it nearly immediately, requiring her to ask them again. This has created sort of a vicious cycle in my mother failing to do things my father wants because of her being stressed out.

I've realized that I have been in denial about my father's actions being abuse for many years. I am trying to do something about this now, but I have a hard time stepping up to the plate and doing it. I've already had a conversation with my father saying that he and my mother should go to therapy, but he said that with all the doctor appointments and other responsibilities they have in taking care of my siblings, that they don't have time to go to therapy. I don't really know what to do about this. I help them out with certain things around the house, but I also have to focus on doing very well in school, so not a lot of my time is available to help during the week either.

I have had talks with my parents in the past about putting my sister in a group home or some institution, but they told me that the ones with acceptable levels of care and ""niceness"" are too expensive for her to live in for the rest of her life. They understandably don't want her to live in a situation where she feels like she is in prison and is unhappy all the time. So we are still trying to sort out how to place my sister in the long term. But the end result of this is our family is still tied down as far as how much free time they have to work through things together.

If anyone else has been through something like this, I would appreciate some advice on how to proceed from here. Thank you for reading.

Need some advice please.,15,0,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/18azen/i_no_longer_believe_in_mormonism_but_im_still/,"This is my first official post on Reddit! I've been looking for the past hour for a popular forum where I could ask for advice, then it occurred to me, wtf am I thinking I should post on reddit. It's pretty late, but I can't sleep and have a lot on my mind, I'm going to try to put it on paper the best I can without making my post too long.


When I first started attending BYU I very much believed in the Mormon religion. So taking religion classes, going to church, etc was all in tune with what I wanted. But I've since fallen away completely mentally, emotionally, spiritually and it's been one of the best decisions I've ever made. But now I'm kind of stuck because I'm still attending there and I don't know if I should try to transfer or not. Here are the pros and cons of staying at BYU.


PROS

- VERY cheap (2k tuition a semester (if you're mormon) 260$ rent)
- A good school academically 

- My GPA is not very good (2.4 with a lot of withdraws) so it will be hard to transfer into another school of its caliber.

- If I transferred some credits wouldn't transfer over

- I have a good amount of friends there who I all love.


CONS

- Virtually no one believes the same things I do. This brings a huge disconnect to others (even my close friends I cannot connect to them on a higher level b/c of this).

- You need to go to church otherwise you can't keep attending the school. They take attendance at church (although I'm not sure if that's just for statistical purposes).

- Can't drink or do drugs (not that I'm interested in doing hard drugs but I would very much like to be able to smoke weed with friends/alone w/o anyone bothering me).

- I have this general feeling that it's holding me back (b/c of the belief thing) b/c I am pretty much still forced to associate with the church and with a lot of those ideologies, which I am so uninterested in that its just such a depressing bummer and everyone around me has and talks about those ideologies and beliefs when I would much rather talk about other stuff.

- Limited ways to have fun b/c of it's strict ""honor code"" which involves no drinking, etc like I already mentioned.

- I want to open my mind as much as possible and develop my ideas and beliefs but I feel like the university almost discourages this.

- Have to take religion classes (rather, I should call them Mormon classes) that I don't give a shit about to graduate.


So pretty much the main reasons I haven't transferred is because of the money and I'm worried I won't get accepted anywhere b/c of my grades, and I have a lot of friends there. But man whenever I picture myself fully untethered and free from the religion and I just feel completely filled with bliss and I can taste the freedom. What are your guys thoughts? Thanks to anyone who read this and feel free to ask me anything. I may go to bed before I can answer but don't worry I'll answer when I get up.

I just wanted to start by saying that I currently attend therapy and am on both Buspar 10mg 3 t/d and 20 mgs celexa 1 time a day. 

Here's my story: As a kid growing up in school I had almost no friends. Maybe 1 or 2 and was ridiculed in grade school a lot. My parents were never home and when they were home they abused me. The severity of abuse was not horrible, but was on a consistant basis when they were home, things like getting stabbed with kitchen utensils, slapped/hit in the face, chased after and hit in the corner, thrown outside totally in the nude (7 yrs old) and a variety of other things. Never had to go to the hospital for broken bones--they were good at hiding visable bruising. 

I had some pretty severe seperation anxiety, as I was taken from my bio parents at a young age and moved to a completely different country. (adopted) I would go home early almost everyday for the first 3 years of school. I could not sleep unless someone was in the room with me, and i suffered from insomnia until i was about 12. I'd have re-occuring thoughts of people around me dying and being left all alone to fend for myself. It caused me to not be able to sleep, as the thoughts were obsessive. 

Somewhere around highschool I had a huge paradym shift and realized that ""winning"" ""manipulating"" and ""lying"" was a way to allievate some of the stress and anxiety i felt day to day. I ridiculed other students, started experimenting with alcohol and drugs, acting out in school, and getting into fights. I went from 3 friends to the entire school being my friend, thinking i was hilarous, and knowing that i was popular. 

I continued this throughout H.S., lost my virginity at age 14 and have been up until then, in very short term relationships. Usually they are very itense and short, i also have a hard time staying at one job. In college i experimented with almost every drug, oxies, acid, cocaine, mdma, list goes on and on. I had another paradym shift and got increasingly depressed and had suicidal ideations all day everyday. 

I went to therapy, and have been going since. I am doing much better now and learning a lot about myself. I never thought i was abused, now i realize i was, ive also surpressed many childhood memories that were more intense, like running around with a knife after my sister, holes in the wall, throwing things, and a bunch of other stuff from when i was younger. 

I've been told i suffer from anxiety, depression, and i dissociate most of my emotions. Most of the time i feel hardly anything inside, and if i do, it is mostly sadness and/or displaced rage. 

The point of this post was to ask if anyone else has had a similar story of their life, or if any psychologists or M.D.'s have had patients with a similar story, and how they resulted, or the things that they did to remedy the problems of dissociation. I'm not sure if I can classify myself as a sociopath, because according to my therapist, the reasons that i lash out violently is because i am very empathetic, it's just that in order to cope i've developed dissociative patterns. 

I've read up a lot on sociopaths and I think i fit the mold for certain aspects, but then other aspects I certainly do not.

EDIT: To go into more depth, i do this less now because of concious effort but i mirror peoples behaviors, adapt. And my main goal in relatinoships is to dominate the other person emotionally so that i am not left in a vulnerable position. To woo them in the begining with monetary things and a good personality, which quickly degrades into a parinoid and volitile personality in which i self destruct the relatinoship in a short peroid of time.

I am in such a weird situation. 

My husband and I monitor the kids' (this would be his children, my stepkids) email correspondence. [For the record, they knew this when we created their email addresses, and every person who emails them gets an automatic email notification of that.] They primarily live with their mom in another state, but they use our email system to interact with their friends, including friends in another (third) state where they used to live.

For the past few days, a 14 year old friend, a girl that I have never met, has been writing back and forth with one of our kids. The girl, I'll call her Ann, has mentioned cutting herself. She originally claimed that when our daughter moved in the summer, that Ann cut herself in distress from it, but stopped at the beginning of the school year. Our daughter reacted in an off-hand way that makes me suspect she had heard something like this before (and we will be following up when that child is in town for Thanksgiving, due to some insinuations that she may also have tried cutting). So that's problem number one.

Additionally, Ann confided in a recent email that she was raped at a very young age.

Third, Ann stated that her caretakers hit her when she got in trouble last night; ""only this time I was hit a lot"", a couple dozen times, causing bruising on the face, thrown into a couch, etc.

Fourth, as a follow up to the previous info, Ann claimed that she would be punishing herself by refusing to eat. 

Unfortunately, I don't know if Ann's word is truth, or if she's trying to ""play"" my daughter.  I really wish there was someone that could go to the school and verify if she truly has injuries, but I can't justify calling the police/911 and asking them to go over there and inspect her, on the off chance that she's just trying to drum up emotion in my daughter with a sensational lie.

Furthermore, Ann seems to have an extremely unhealthy dependence on her current boyfriend (again, if he actually exists). She waxes poetic about how he makes everything okay, would never hurt her, helps her calm down, etc. This is good in some ways, but I'm also concerned that if anything happens to that relationship, it will have a very bad effect.

I have been dealing with drama queens and chronic liars on the internet since the late 1990s. I have dealt with at least one pathological liar in real life. Until I dropped out of college, I was going for a counseling degree. So I do have life experience in bullshit detection. Based on the emails going back and forth, and being unable to interact with Ann directly, I'm 50/50 on whether this is real or bullshit.

What I specifically hope someone can tell me: 
1) who should I tell?
2) if this is NOT bullshit, the caretakers cannot be trusted to get her psychological help for her dependence on her boyfriend and for her cutting. is there any law about the school, or any other resource like CPS or whatever, being empowered/required to help in this situation?
3) anybody with more experience dealing with manipulative liars have any tips for higher-quality bullshit detection?

You guys are great, and I'm very thankful for this community.

I was often bullied in my middle and high school years. I've reflected on my experiences a lot since then, and I thought I would share my musings in the hope that I can help someone else have the childhood that they were meant to.

This article is for anyone in middle or high school who is often targeted by bullies. There's other material on-line that you should read, also. Google ""bullying advice"" and you'll find some articles. Some are better than others, so read several of them.

Ultimately, of course, this will turn out to be a note from my old self to my young self. A lot of you will feel that it doesn't apply to your situation. Everyone's story is unique. Still, this should have some value to those out there who are facing this dark side of human nature. Especially if you're as naive as I was!

When asked what she wished for, Maryln vos Savant said sometimes she wished that we would all get what we deserve. It's not healthy to wish evil on others, so just accept that some people will not face justice for their actions in this life. This article will concentrate on you -- your attitudes. To combat bullying, you will work on yourself.

When I think back, the bullying events I regret most are the ones where I did not stick up for myself. Whatever you face, your reaction and attitudes will determine whether the event is something you can be proud of, whether you win or lose. You have power because you control your mind and actions. We're going to develop that power. A good card player is not one who gets good cards, but one who knows how to play the cards he’s dealt. Aim to become someone who keeps his head up and handles whatever life throws at him.

SOME PERSPECTIVE

Kids can be remarkably vicious to each other. One reason is that they don't face serious consequences for behavior which, if done as an adult, would land them in jail. They identify targets and attack them. It's a way of building comraderie (with others) -- nothing unites people like a common enemy. So, they make you that enemy, perhaps because you’re different, or perhaps because there’s nothing you have that they want. It may be ""wrong,"" but it's natural.

As Will and Ariel Durant write in ""The Lessons of History,"" life is competition. Life is conflict. Humans conflict. It's a fact of life. It's not just you; you are not alone in this. **You are not alone.** We must all deal with those around us, one way or another. When you're older, you'll still conflict with people around you, thought perhaps not in such overt ways, so don't think conflict will end when you graduate. Get used to it now, and learn how to handle it well.

In public school, you're surrounded by students with all sorts of destinies. The kids around you will be tomorrow's CEOs, plumbers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, doctors, engineers, accountants, presidents and homeless. As you go higher in education, though, you spend your days with people who are more and more just like you. If you make it to a post-doctoral program, you'll be rubbing elbows with folks who all share your interest in a narrow niche of a particular field.

If you're having trouble socializing in public school, know that it will get easier as you get older. However, if you can, you should interact with and learn from your classmates while you have the chance. After graduating from high school, you'll rarely get the chance to mix with so many different people.

Why do some people bully others? Each has his own reasons. There will always be people who want power over you. Some hurt others just because they can get away with it, some attack you out their own insecurity, and some were abused themselves. Some people like to feed off others. They may even attempt to make you think that you need them. You don't need them, but they need you, and that's why they won't leave you alone.

Not all bullies are simple scumbags; some are quite talented.  Though ethics teaches that we should use our abilities to help others, some choose not to live that way, and they instead use their talents to take advantage of others.

These are not excuses for their behavior, and you should not accept any such excuses as justification for their actions. If you can discover where a bully is coming from, though, you might find something you can use. The highest form of warfare is to turn an enemy into a friend, so if you see an opportunity to reach out to a bully with understanding, for example, take it. You have nothing to lose.

**Your being bullied is not your fault. Consider that being bullied is just a lesson in the harsh realities of life. Your suffering comes from learning this lesson faster than most others.**

SURVIVAL

Ok, let's lay some ground rules.

If you're being attacked by a group or someone with a weapon, run and get to either the police or some other authority figure. I know I said to stick up for yourself before, but don't be stupid.

If you're being abused by a teacher, go to the principal. If the principal is bothering you, or doesn't help you, go to your parents, the PTA, the town school board, or the police. Everyone has a boss or someone they're accountable to.

A word of caution, though: do not go to the police or authority unless your bully does something that's actionable, meaning, you're sure that he'll be arrested or severely disciplined.
If you go to an authority figure because of a simple bullying incident, you'll lose credibility, and they'll be less likely to listen to you in the future.

Side note to parents: I've seen fathers being interviewed on TV state that they wouldn't help their sons if they were having trouble with a teacher.  They'd want the boy to learn how to fend for himself. I feel this is a mistake.  First, the kid is already trying to get along with his classmates and learn his school material.  Second, he's at a disadvantage because he's a kid, and the teacher is an adult.  Third, he's at a further disadvantage because he's in a teacher-student relationship.  If your son is having trouble with a teacher, HELP HIM.  Get involved and confront the teacher and/or principal. Let your son learn to be an adult by watching you, not by fighting with some creepy teacher.

THE FIGHT

Your first weapon is self-control. Control your emotions.
If you're not in control of yourself, then your opponent is controlling you. Uncontrolled emotions make you more fun to pick on. They'll also lead you to do something stupid.

Your second weapon is self-knowledge. Know thyself, and be honest with yourself. Know what your physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses are. You need to understand yourself to fight back against bullies; use your strengths, and protect your weaknesses. What weaknesses can be worked on, and which must you live with? Accept your faults, and know that everyone has faults of their own.

Everyone is better than everyone else in some way. When in conflict, people try to move the conflict into an arena where they think they can win. Someone who is big or is a good fighter will of course want to fight with you physically. Witty talkers and comedians will engage you in a war of words. They insult you and watch you carefully so they can make fun of every little thing you do wrong. Socialites will embarrass you in class and attack your friendships. They control conversations and exclude you from them.

To defend yourself, you need to discover and develop your own talents.

Next is self-mastery. You're in a war, whether you like it or not. It is your responsibility to help yourself. The problem will not go away on its own. Even worse, if you do nothing, people will think of you as a great target, and the problem will spread. If a bully is attacking you alone, you can do whatever you want, but if there are other people watching, you must respond.

Learn to defend yourself physically -- try taking self-defense classes.  The idea is not so much to win fights, but to build confidence, get physical and mental exercise, and make friends outside of school. It's also important for you to absorb the martial arts attitude: staying calm and in control of yourself.

You must be able to defend yourself verbally as well.  Google ""verbal judo"" and read up.

See the bully as a challenge, a puzzle to solve. If someone likes to attack you physically, trick him into doing it when an authority figure is watching. Get creative.  

There are many ways that you can react to a bully. If you have mastered yourself, you do not react according to your emotions.  Rather you think and pick a reaction that serves you.  In this way, you fight for control of the situation.

Don't be a passive victim. You can be a fighter, but it can be risky to play the bully's game.  **Try to find the winner's response.**  The winner engages and participates in what is happening, fights for control, and tries to turn the situation in his favor.  If you lose, it's just a loss.

Get good at that game, and it will serve you for the rest of your life.  When you grow up, you'll find that you'll still have conflicts with other adults, but it takes different forms.  There will be not (so much) fighting and name-calling, but competing. And as now, the one who controls the conflict will most likely win.

PROTECT YOUR DEVELOPMENT

**Academics:** This comes first and foremost. You may not realize this but this might just be the most important time of your life. The young years are extremely important. Young people learn and grow much faster than adults, so make good use of your time. How you spend your time now sets the stage for the remainder of your life. You can recover from a miserable childhood, of course, but it's tough, and would require a disproportionate amount of energy.

I'm not saying you should study all the time. Just don't let bullies sway you from doing what you want to do. Continue to speak up in class, raise your hand, try out for sports, ask that other kid out on a date, join clubs, pursue your hobbies outside of school.

You're in school for a reason -- take it seriously, and don't let them stop you from getting its benefits. You owe it to your future self.

Don't let anyone steal your experiences. Compete for them! Try to be the one who gets called on to help out with the science experiment. Experiences add to you; they are yours to be had. Don't let bullies impact your development. Use all the tools of the last section to prevent that from happening.

**Physical:** Sometimes, there's no substitute for strength, not just for fighting, but for survival situations. You're probably not a sports jock, and that's okay, but everyone needs exercise. A healthy mind requires a healthy body. Get involved in athletics at your school. If your situation is such that you can't do that, exercise on your own, or join that martial arts class.

**Social:** If bullying gets pervasive it can cause social isolation, and this can cause the worst long-term damage to you. Despite whatever bullying is going on, you must learn to interact with your peers, make friends, and experiment with leadership roles. Heard about emotional intelligence (EQ)?  It's important for success, so don't neglect it. How you spend your time and who you spend your time with are two of the most important decisions you will make on a daily basis. If the social scene at school is hopeless then participate in activities outside of school.

Some bullies may take over a conversation by talking over you or steering the conversation to subjects that exclude you, thereby denying you the chance to build up your own verbal and social skills. There are no rules that prevent people from doing this, so you must just avoid these people.

Conversation and making friends takes confidence, and bullying attacks your confidence, but don’t give up! Keep going and you'll win the confidence race.

CLOSING THOUGHTS

A word of warning -- when I was in school, my self-confidence was so low I looked to bad people for friendship. You know, the toxic personality types. Basically, I hung out with anyone who would hang out with me. I thought if someone didn't bully me, they're friends, but this turned out to be very wrong. A true friend is someone who accepts you as you are, and doesn't require you to lower yourself. If they demand a price from you, they are not your friends. Toxic friends may not be bullies, per se, but they're feeding off you in other ways. As Dr. Phil wrote, we teach people how to treat us. A friend will listen. If you find yourself feeling hurt by a ""friend"" too often, if you have to consistently sacrifice for someone who gives little in return, remove him from your life.

One more thing to watch out for: **bullying can leave you emotionally raw.** You'll become more sensitive, and may come to think that a simple jibe is bullying, when it is not meant to be. Continue to evaluate -- is a critical comment meant to be an insult or is it just criticism? If you're trying out for the baseball team and some kid says your throw sucks, he may not be trying to bully you. Perhaps he's just challenging you to improve your throw. Don't become over-sensitive. It can damage relationships with real friends.

Life is long, and your circumstances will change. There's a whole world out there to experience. **It gets better.** I am now living a life that I would never have anticipated when I was in high school. Persevere, and you'll amaze yourself with who you become.

And forget about the bullies. Everyone has their own problems to deal with. Don't be vengeful. It's been said that success is the best revenge, so I wish you every success!

This means that I was not eligible for unemployment.  I had to move back in with my parents who are now paying my car payment and supporting me.  In December I will be 30.  For the past 6 months I have been applying everywhere I can.  I had an interview for a call center job and in it I saw men my father's age leaving.  Men dressed in suits with resumes that dwarfed mine in experience and education.  I did not get the job.  A job I could have done in my sleep that I was tremendously overqualified for.  Because one of the Vice Presidents of the company I worked for before was the college roommate of this companies Head of H.R. I found out it was *because* I was overqualified that I did not get the job, they were afraid of losing me.

Since then I have applied to hundreds of jobs and rarely even get a call back.  Last week the contracting firm that represented me in my previous job set me up with an interview for a position that I was qualified for and that I had lots of previous experience with.  I thought that the interview went very, very well.  I was also told that I was the only candidate of the 4 they interviewed that had **ANY** experience in the field, let alone doing the exact job.  I found out today I did not get the job.

I emailed the woman who represents me at the contracting firm and asked her if there was a problem with my resume or if there was a certification I could get that would help my chances.  She emailed me back and said that the people who interviewed me loved the resume and thought that my technical knowledge was a perfect match, but I did not come off at enthusiastic enough about the position in the interview.

I don't know what to do.  Did they want me to beg, because I would have.  My life is at a complete standstill because of this.  I want a place of my own.  I want to propose to my girlfriend soon.  Her sister got married last month and it was the first time I met most of her family.  Her parents live in Florida and it was the first time I got to meet them in person.  I had to explain to everyone at the wedding that I am 30, I live with my parents, and that I have no job.

I am so depressed right now I can't tell if I am numb or hysterical.  I figured these people would have wanted someone who was professional.  I would have begged.

Worried it is getting worse.,16,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/xvpk9/i_have_zero_motivation_to_do_anything_at_work/,"Right, so, I figure this is the best possible place to seek any sort of help or support.

I'm 24, I have a job and a mortgage. I live in the UK, in a small town, and work at a big corporation in the town. It's a desk job, which means a PC and.. internet. I'm not a very outgoing person and I struggle to articulate or explain myself sometimes. I have a bad habit of talking first, thinking after. 

Over the last few months, things have been getting funny for me. I'm in a pretty good relationship, with an awesome girlfriend, who can make things difficult, but hey, relationships are not easy right? I spend my spare time playing video games (or used to) and surfing the internet.

But more and more over these months, I'm surfing the web at work, and not doing what I'm supposed to. I don't know how to kick it. I feel like I'm in a spiral of defeat. I struggle to get up in the mornings, getting in on time, and when I get to work I have no sense of urgency or work ethic. It's gotten to the point where I am disgusted with myself. I think I try to rationalize it too much - ""everybody does it"", ""why should I try when nobody else does"", etc. I want to stop. I want to find the motivation that got me out of bed and into work when I started 6 years ago. But thinking back, I have never had this motivation. I don't know what to do.

I can't ask my friends, since they don't have jobs or work part time. They haven't been working at the same company for 6 years. They all went to university and had an awesome time, meeting new friends and getting drunk. I get the part time version - all the work, none of the fun. Even nowadays, I'm so lucky, fortunate, even spoiled, yet this still weighs heavily on me. I feel like I've missed out. I don't want to tell my ""work friends"" or my parents because I just feel as if they would be ashamed of me.

I like my job - I like the people I work with, and I understand the systems I work with. But, I just can't focus. Hell, I'm writing this while at work - what sort of impression does that give?

So, I'm not really sure what I'm asking, but here goes - **What gives you folks motivation? Why do you get up in the morning? What gets you through the day and prevents you slacking off? What advice can you give me to help me get through this?** I go to get paid so I can keep living. And that's all I can think about now. I will say even now that this whole thing seems stupid. It must look pathetic to people who are unemployed and would kill for my job. Cast judgement as you would.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the advice so far guys, keep it coming. I'm gonna give a few of these a shot the rest of this week/next week and I'll report back. It sounds like a lack of job satisfaction is my problem, even if I am in complete and utter denial about it.

I am 22 and live with my parents - I have a full time job and so pay them a small sum as rent to help towards shopping etc. I've never had a problem with this - I feel it's good to help out, plus I know it helps money management skills.

My sister pays the same amount. But she has a boyfriend, who is becoming a problem for me...

I don't like him... He comes out with the most stupid things sometimes and has to give his advice on everything! But the thing that annoys me the most about him, is that he has practically moved in and doesn't pay his way. My parents are too polite to ask, but in my mind if I was in his situation, I would be offering to help with things and pay rent.

The plot thickens further... He isn't short of cash, and wants to use his wealth well - so he's decided to get a mortgage and buy a house - but his plan is to rent it out and continue living a free and very comfortable life here!

My opinion is that he is scrounging off my parents generosity - I have discussed this with my parents and said something along the lines of ""if I didn't pay my way, you'd probably kick me out, but you'd let him stay here no worries!"" to which they agree and shrug off the awkward conversation...

So I was wondering... Am I being a dick for thinking this? Or is this guy in the wrong?

I guess I'll start it off quick; I've got a terrible procrastination problem. 

It really started to manifest itself in the first year of college. I had just graduated from a private school with a 4.0 GPA. As an only child, I was at full attention. Parents were proud. I had been accepted to the engineering program at the state university. I was proud. Things were coming together.

When the courses started, nothing was a red-flag at first. Classes were manageable, and I didn't have to put much effort in. But then one day I overslept. Missed class, so I decided to head off to the library to go over the notes and catch up. 

I instead goofed off and proceeded to waste the day. Night came, so I reasoned I'd wake up early and finish it then. I slept normally and decided to skip again because I didn't want to go to class unprepared. Not sure if it was a pride issue or just reluctance. 

This very quickly stacked and ended up having me skip almost entire weeks, just to catch up to last weeks. Semester ended with me getting a 1.8 GPA.

Since I had never gotten anything lower than a B, this was quite a shock to everyone. Lots of yelling with parents, with me pretty much saying it was a fluke and ""I got this"". But second semester was worse. Much worse.

I failed every single class.

During this period is when I think I started becoming depressed. I was suspended from school, and my mom practically told me that she didn't know who I was anymore. That one hurt. But after my dad was done yelling, he enrolled me in a community college as a silent understanding that it must have been just a really expensive mistake. 

Even with the classes being easier, I can't seem to focus or make it to any of my classes. I don't know if it's attention span, or apathy, or fear of failure. All I know is that I'm probably going to repeat the same this semester. Then I'd really be stuck.

I don't know what to do. I've talked with counselors, but that's done nothing other than make me feel determined for about 2-3 days. I need a lasting change, and I don't know if that's from a serious therapist, medication, or if I just gotta kick myself in the balls every morning.

Bleh. I probably left a lot of things out, but I didn't want it to be too long. I work best with questions, so ask away if you have any.

1333679353.0,16,self.needadvice,rvoac,I think my family is falling apart,18,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/rvoac/i_think_my_family_is_falling_apart/,"First, it is important to note that I am almost 20 years old. Anyways...a few weeks ago, I had a routine doctor's visit, just to get some prescriptions refilled. I decided to go without my mother this time (I usually drag her along, even though we don't really get along, because I don't really like going places by myself) to ask the doctor about getting put onto birth control. It was necessary to not have my mother there because my family (especially her) is extremely religious and do not know I am sexually active and heavily look down upon the idea of sex before marriage. 

A few days later, I went to an urgent care center for an extremely bad sore throat, and they put me on antibiotics. When I went to turn this prescription in, I also made a point to pick up my birth control. I asked my dad to stop on his way home and get my antibiotics, since they weren't going to ready until later and I didn't feel like waiting around. 

When he got home, all hell broke loose. Apparently, unknown to me, the antibiotics I was put on had an interaction warning when being taken with the birth control I was put on. When the pharmacist told my dad about the interaction, he had no idea what was going on, as the name of the medicine was nothing he knew I was taking. He came home and looked up the name and realized what I had done. It was my mom, however that began attacking me. She threw my antibiotics at me and told me what my dad had found out. She continued the rest of the evening to torment me, telling me I was disgusting for sleeping with someone after only a month (I've been with my boyfriend longer than that, but she told me that she and my dad had known what I was doing all the nights I told them I was staying at my friends house right after I started dating him) and asking me if I would marry someone after only a month, as now me and my boyfriend are, in the eyes of God. She doesn't even know about the two other people I've slept with. She also told me that when I didn't ask her to come to the doctor with me, she had a suspicion I was getting myself put on birth control, and in the days between when I had gone to see the doctor and when I actually picked up the pills, she had gone through my room looking for them, not only finding the issues of Cosmo I own, but also some condoms.

Thankfully, I am away at college 5 days a week. However, I come home every weekend and have to deal with my mother making rude side comments referencing the fact that I've had sex, as well as full blown fights. The only bit my father had to say in all this was ""There will be no premarital sex in my house"". That was right after he found out, and since then hasn't said anything else about it to me. I've told him what my mom has been doing to me, and he's tried talking to her and has said we as a family need to work on our communication and acceptance of one another. 

Tonight was the worst, as I came home from school earlier, and in less than two hours, my mom had tried to start four fights just with me, as well as a few with my dad. Eventually I came to her and told her if things were going to be this way, I was going to start staying at school full time.  I can't take all the fighting, and I can see that me being around doesn't exactly make people here happy. She, of course, started going on about how it's my fault, and what I did has caused all these problems. My dad got involved and started yelling at her. When I tried to escape all the fighting, my dad told me I was crying too hard to see to drive anywhere, and I needed to get out of the room. That was when I finally told him I didn't want to come home anymore, and he lost it. He started screaming at my mother she was tearing the family apart. She tried to tell him it's not her doing it, but he just kept yelling. At that point, I left the room and went and curled up in my bed.

I guess I just don't know what to do at this point. I guess it just blows my mind that anyone could treat their child this way. Any thoughts of what to do now?

How do you deal with anger in a healthy way?,16,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/rag9v/i_have_anger_issues_amongst_other_things_how_do/,"I will try to make this brief, and there is a TLDR. I will mention my boyfriend in this post, but I am not asking for advice in our relationship. I am asking how to deal with my anger, which I tend to direct at my partner.

Background:

-childhood history of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. 
-no models for positive coping mechanisms
-sullen and moody teenager with some suicidal thoughts.
-we always lived out in the boonies, so I was often alone, but not unhappy about this, I often liked being alone
-mother and stepfather divorced when I was 18. 
-little brother died in a car accident in my early twenties. He was 16, and driving like an idiot. 
-now on third long-term partner who says ""You have anger issues.""
-given ultimatum by one partner (second long-term partner) to seek anger management, and I did see a Jungian analyst for a few months, not sure it was helpful
-suffered from depression and anxiety disorder, suicidal thoughts
-got help from a therapist plus Celexa and Ristoril
-made some life changes: started dating a man who was a longtime friend and my number one supporter, got involved in a volunteer organization whose mission I love, and switched to a job that would be more enjoyable. Also started exercising more, and filling my life with activities that could cultivate a sense of eudaimonia, such as gardening and painting. 
-stopped seeing that therapist and stopped the medication a year ago. I have had very few setbacks - down days, a couple sleepless nights, but mostly have maintained a sense of self-efficacy and eudaimonia. 


The Current Situation:

I still get angry so quickly, and so definitely. Something will happen that will set me off, and for hours, possibly days, possibly weeks, I get worked up about it, to the point of blasting my partner with angry venting or giving him an icy cold shoulder. My anger clouds my mind, overwhelms my reasoning, and makes me want to punch and kick things. 

Additionally, I have developed an eating disorder as a result of a restrictive diet and exercise regimen that I thought would help me clean up my regular diet (big time sugar addict right here). 

(I have started seeing a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. My boyfriend knows as do a couple close friends, so I am getting help.)

I have a tendency to obsess over perceived injustices (obsessive thinking happens in anxiety disorders, and also in this binge/purge cycle I have entered). Constant thinking about injustice probably stems from my childhood abuse. I HATE when others impose anything upon me, carry certain expectations, or change something on me at the last minute. I also hate it when people abuse my time or my things. I don't like it when other invade my privacy or even visit unannounced. I have my boundary lines, and when people cross them, I get MAD. 

But I don't necessarily voice it. My boyfriend's parents are big perpetrators to me right now. I spent years defining the lines with my mother, who now respects them, and now I feel I have to defend myself against his parents, who are generally well-meaning people (though his mother is neurotic and he's a mama's boy). When they ""trespass against me,"" I am as gracious as I could possibly be, but my boyfriend will feel the heat of my anger later (I am so lucky to have someone who will help me through this rather than run screaming the other direction).

Also, I now feel very vulnerable with my boyfriend. He's the guy I want for lifetime partnership, and he knows it. For the longest time, he thought I was someone indifferent toward marriage, and I was. But that's changed, and I've voiced this to him. He still hasn't gotten around to proposing even though he says he wants to marry me, and though I suppose that would be disappointing for most people, I AM PISSED. I watched my boyfriend's cousin propose to his girlfriend just this past Saturday, and I was so angry I could barely speak to my boyfriend for the next hour. He knew it. I tried breathing exercises and reasoning, but I really just wanted to punch him. I'm like an oversized angry kid - the bully. I try to keep it under control, and I do to an extent, but, it's not fair to him, and I certainly don't think it is healthy for me.

I have mentioned this to my ED therapist, and she now wants me to figure out to myself if the ED could possibly be linked to the anger. Whether it is or not, the anger still needs to be dealt with. 

How the hell do you do that?

Somehow she's developed this notion that I'm some kind of worthless, obnoxious, spoiled brat (her words) even though I buy all of my clothes and things I want/need, thank her genuinely after every meal she makes, every little thing she buys, and every little trip.

Without going too far into it, she works 3 days a week, lives off of child support payments, makes dinner maybe once a week, and spends the majority of her time watching reality TV and playing FarmVille. She has violent mood swings and can be genuinely terrifying sometimes.

The other day I had to get to work and was unable to shovel the porch like I was asked. This resulted in her saying she doesn't think she'll contribute to my college education if I'm that self centered and lazy. Then it snowballed into her telling me I should quit my job and drop out of school to live with my dad an hour away. Frustrated, I took time after work to call my therapist who I see for depression sometimes. Because I wasn't home immediately my mom thought I was hiding from her and threatened to call the police.

I get home and get in the shower, locking the door. Scared, I call a friend to ask if I can stay with him. My mom somehow hears me talking to him and starts kicking and throwing herself at the door to get in to take my phone away. I later learn she called my friends mom to tell her not to take me in, but I'm staying there tonight anyway.

I have a conundrum...

Backstory, I work with a 26 year old girl (I am also female, but 23) who very quickly became my best friend and who I (stupidly) moved in with after a few months. She seemed totally fine at first, but over the last six months, has become a slovenly, lazy, drug abuser. 

Yesterday, I forced her to sign over her rights to the apartment we share, so that as of Jan. 31, she is off the lease and I can live in peace again.

I am worried about the safety of my personal belongings, as well as my own safety at this point. She used to use heroin, pretty regularly, and I've watched her pop morphine and oxycontin on a daily basis. It didn't affect me, and she seems to be able to do her job fine while on it, so I never really gave much of a shit. (Fun Fact: her second job is assistant director for a latchkey program for underprivileged elementary school kids...)

But she's always had serious temper issues. She's been arrested for assault before, but her dad is a cop, so she got off scott-free both times.

These days, she brings her dealer to my front door, buys her drug of choice, and then spends hours in her bathroom doing whatever she is buying. (I might add that her parents have had to help her pay her rent more than once during this six month lease...)

How can I protect my shit (I alone furnished the apartment, not including her bedroom... ie 55"" tv, gaming systems, couch, 8 ft bean bag chair etc...) from her wrath? I also have a special needs cat that I'm worried she may hurt. I have caught her intentionally grossly over-feeding her (out of spite?), and now she no longer has access to the cat food.

All I want is her out of my life, and as of Jan 31, she's off the lease and I can call the cops if she either won't leave or tries to fuck with me.

Other details: 
-I smoke pot, and substantial amounts of it, without a medical card, I can't turn her in for drugs (not that i even would) because I have just as much shit to keep under wraps. 
-I no longer have to work with her, per her request, I have been transfered.
-I do not own a weapon for protection, nor have I ever shot a gun. 
-Throw-away account, as I could give a shit about karma points right now... just need advice.

I've posted this here, as well as legal, in order to get as much exposure as possible. I'm in quite a situation and I'm at a total loss of what to do.



I was written a ticket in Pitt County, NC (Greenville) for not having car insurance, according to the Officer's computer/DMV. I explained to him that I did have insurance and showed him the old and new insurance card proving that I was covered. He told me that it was not proof and because the computer said I didn't have insurance, he had to write me a ticket. I also explained to him that this has happened before, where the DMV said I didn't have insurance (when I did) and that it was probably a hiccup in the system. While he was writing the ticket I remembered that the other officer called my insurance company to clear everything up and told me to just sort things out with the DMV, so it was too late for him to call my Insurance company. When he gave me the ticket he told me all I had to do was to turn it in with a form to the DA and it would be dismissed, no problem. Two weeks later I returned to Greenville (I live in Raleigh.) to give them my FS-1 form and I thought all was well.



Until now. I am applying to Apartments in Asheville, NC to go to school there. When they ran the background check on me, the ticket came up as a criminal charge. I had NO idea this was going to happen, so I called the DA to make sure everything was taken care of. When I called, it was confirmed that it was dismissed but the only way for it to be removed from my record was to see an attorney.



Today I called the Attorney General's office and was directed to the SBI Expungement Office and was told to call the Clerk in Pitt County regarding needing legal counsel. I did so and was told that I could submit the forms myself. The forms are crazy legalese and I would hate to mess them up, especially if there is a large filing fee. I also spoke with an attorney and was quoted $500 (including filing fees) to have it removed and it would take 4 - 6 months.



Here is my question: Why do I have to pay someone to remove a charge from my background, that labels me as a criminal, for something I did not even do in the first place?! It would be different if I was driving around without insurance, but I was insured, meaning that I really should have never received the ticket. What can I do to get it removed without having to pay a lawyer to do so? The Legal Assistant that emailed me a copy of the dismissal told me it wasn't that big of a deal to have it on there, but why should I have to explain that I’m not a criminal to Apartment complexes/jobs/etc for something I never did. Is there anything I can do?



Thanks! Any and all help would be GREATLY appreciated!

Now, I'm not really sad and blue anymore but I've become this stale introverted hermit who very much dislikes leaving the house...",19,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/nhdyk/once_upon_a_time_i_was_convivial_and_social_as/,"*For the TL;DR version, read the bold text.*

**I used to be fun.** I hated staying home and doing nothing and i'd jump at every opportunity to go out and socialize and chum up with whoever, wherever. My mom would complain nonstop that I went out too much and stayed out too late when I'd be home from college (though i wasn't going out more than your average outgoing 18-21 year old, nor was I irresponsible in any way- Mom was just the kind of mom who'd try setting a midnight curfew for her 20 year old kid home from college).


**Then shit happened and I swan-dove into depression...the never-leave-the-house, can-barely-get-out-of-bed-or-even-shower, drink-a-lot-and-smoke-a-lot-of-pot kind of depression.** I ended up withdrawing from school because I wasn't ever going to class anyway, and my grades flawlessly illustrated my lack of attendance. I eventually saw a doc and got on antidepressants and things started slowly crawling uphill from there. 


**Now, a little over 2 years later, I'm in a much better place.** I'm no longer bumming around all day being all sad and pathetic and feeling sorry for myself; I'm getting out of bed, showering, and going to work everyday; I don't really drink much or smoke much anymore; I've acquired a dynamite boyfriend that I've recently moved in with. Although some days are better than others, things are pretty alright overall. 


**Nevertheless, I just haven't been the same since my depression.** It's like I'm missing that spark I'd had my whole life prior to this downward spiral into desolation. My favorite thing is sitting at home not doing much of anything. I dislike going out and doing anything. When I have to go out, it requires a LOT of mental preparation and psyching up before hand. During these outings, I'm still good at socializing, shooting the shit, and generally not being awkward with people like I was before, but I spend the whole time looking forward to going home so I can get back to doing nothing. I get tired of the outside world fairly quickly. When I go visit my mom now, she actually asks me to go out and do stuff, which is really weird. But 99.98% of the time, I'd just rather not. This kind of bothers me.


**I suppose I'm wondering if I can ever get back to my fun old self, or if I've simply changed and I just haven't quite gotten used to it yet. Do people often go from one end of the Sociability Spectrum to the other? Is it perhaps that I've simply grown out of the fun party stage and become one of those low-key people who'd rather sit at home and do crosswords? Or did depression just really fuck up who I am that much, leaving me with a gaping scar of monotony? Or am I still kind of depressed, even though I'm not all sad and pitiful anymore? Do I have to maybe re-train myself to be like old me? If so, how do I go about doing this?**

**If you are not interested in the story of my life, just skip the following 3-4 paragraphs.**

I was socially awkward (and still I'm not perfect) for a long time of my life. Naturally, I quit sports (was a social outcast even after being there for three years) and started spending all my time in front of the computer at about the age of 10.

Things got better at about 17, when I met a now really close friend, who tought me a lot about interacting with people and stuff like that. I also made some ""friends"" at school, however we only hung out at school, so whenever there were holidays I spend most of that time alone (still in front of the computer). So when I finished school, I didn't have anyone to hang out with anymore.

Now I'm studying at university in a different city, and although my life is still getting gradually better, it's basically the same as in school. I still don't have many friends which I can hang out with outside of university. Especially now that there's a break of about two months.

Having spent most of my past time in front of the computer, I started to work on myself, especially the part where I'm always in front of the computer.
Since I don't have many friends, I still have to spend most of my time alone. So, I started to go jogging reguarily (after not doing any sports for almost 10 years), I sometimes go outside to read a book and ride my bike.

For me, that already is a great improvement, but I'm still lonely and I can't do these activities if the weather is bad, also they don't fill a whole day. So I still end up in front of the computer most of the time.

**What are other activities you can do away from the computer (alone)?** 

**Also, I'm wondering, what do other people do when they don't spend all their time in front of the computer/TV?**

**This gets long under here. I'm sorry. Maybe it's part venting my frustrations, but I think the rest of me is seriously concerned for her future.**

I'm fairly certain that I'm going to be told to suck it up and tell her to get help for her benefit. I'm fully aware that I should, but anytime someone confronts her with her lies, she cuts them off completely.

So...some background: The first hint that something was wrong was when she was in the ninth grade. I was pulled out of class one day by my guidance counselor and the school nurse, who asked me if I knew the difference between a ""good"" touch and a ""bad"" touch, then proceeded to grill me for two hours about whether my father has been molesting me for the past few years. I told them the truth: No, he'd never touched me. They said, ""Well, your sister told us he's been molesting her for years.""

When we'd visit my dad, we shared a bedroom. There's no bloody way my father touched her. If he had, I would have known. I've never been very close with him since he divorced my mom, but I do know that he is not the type of guy to be inappropriate with any child.

Inevitably, all of this was dragged into court, as my parents were in the midst of another custody/child support battle. Thankfully, the record states that there is no evidence that anything untoward occurred, but needless to say, it destroyed their relationship, and he ended up not feeling comfortable around me, either.

Later, when she was in college, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after an apparent suicide attempt. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. We all came to support her and take part in the family therapy that was strongly suggested by her psychologist. During these sessions, the psychologist would bring up supposed episodes in my sister's past that brought her to that point. Some of the highlights:

* She had attempted suicide four times since the age of 4. Apparently at 4, she tried to suffocate herself. At 8, she slit her wrists. At 12, she swallowed pills, but threw them up. And now she was in her 20s, hospitalized for an apparent suicide attempt with pills. The only one that was possibly true was this latest attempt.

* Our late first stepfather had once beaten her so badly that she was hospitalized for a week. He was a terrible man, incredibly emotionally abusive, but he never laid a hand on her...and trust me, he was not smart enough to hit people where it wouldn't leave a mark - he did beat my brother and my mother.

* She suffered from a litany of rare illnesses. To my knowledge, she hasn't been hospitalized for anything since she was a small child, and certainly never with a rare illness.

(*Edit:* A few years later, I came down with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. My first hint of a problem was 14 hours of leg cramps in both legs, followed by immediate weakness that started spreading. After I got out of the hospital a few weeks later, she called me and informed me that I'd never believe it - both of her legs had cramped for a few hours, and boy, she was sure worried that she'd gotten Guillain-Barre, too. ""Boy, what would the chances have been of that?"")

Shocked, my mother and I informed the psychologist that none of those things were true. We proceeded with therapy, but I feel it was highly ineffective for a variety of reasons.

Fast-forward to about six months later. She's visiting for a week or so. My sister, her friend, and I all went out to lunch one morning. She excuses herself to use the restroom. She comes back, and about that time, her friend goes to get more food (it was a buffet). My sister casually turns to me and says, ""Oh, thank God, I got my period. I was raped two weeks ago, and I was worried that I was pregnant."" She goes on to tell me, ""Yeah, I was at the gas station, and this guy asks me for help, and I know I'm stupid, but I followed him behind the building and he raped me.""

Now, I know that different people handle crises differently. But, knowing my sister and her typical response to an incredibly stressful situation, she would not be able to just casually turn to me and mention that she'd been raped. I just kind of sat there and looked around - how the heck do you respond to that? Especially when you're almost certain it's a complete lie?

A few years later, she goes to grad school and seems to stabilize. She's losing weight, she's not lying as terribly as she normally does, she's making friends...she's actually enjoying life. She finishes her master's program and moves onto another school for her PhD. We're all proud and happy for her, since it seemed she'd found something that truly helped her get her head straight.

One year into her program, she starts to withdraw from the family. She's spending uncomfortable amounts of time with her best friend and her best friend's family. The holiday season comes, and she spends the entire time in the bedroom, on her computer, or texting her best friend. Christmas passes, and I make a mental note to get up early the next morning so that I could tell her goodbye before she left for home. She got up before everyone else, packed up the car, and left without a word.

A few weeks later, her best friend calls me. My sister has locked herself in her apartment and has threatened to commit suicide. My sister had apparently called her in tears and begged her to come over and read her note. Supposedly my sister was heartbroken over her financial situation and being unable to pay for school, so she figured the best way to rid everyone of the problems she was having was to kill herself. Her best friend wanted to know what she should do. She didn't think my sister was actually serious, but she wanted my advice. Since she had a key, I requested that she at least go and make sure that my sister is up and walking around. Thankfully she is, and she makes plans to come home to my mother's for awhile to get her head straight.

She spent less than a week there before she ran back home. My parents didn't know that she had supposedly threatened suicide, so my guess is that it wasn't as mentally fulfilling as she'd hoped, and she went back to school, the one thing she claimed was stressing her out the most.

We go back to zero contact. I can't even get her on Facebook. Finally, one day, she IMs me and casually informs me that she had been sick, gotten an ear infection, and lost her hearing suddenly. Two weeks later, she IMs me again to tell me not to tell our mother, but her hearing hadn't come back and she was worried that something happened to her eardrum or the bones in the ear or something. She was deaf.

I called my mother to ask if she'd heard anything along those lines. While I am explaining my suspicions, my sister's friend calls, and Mom talks to her for awhile.

My sister had gone to her best friend, crying, saying, ""I can't tell them, I can't hear them, you need to tell them for me. You need to tell them I'm deaf.""

We all bought it, hook, line, and sinker. My mother calls me back in tears and says, ""Well, if she's lying, she's got Tammy in on it, too, and they're good."" I immediately feel terrible, thinking maybe there really was something wrong with her. It could have been a nerve issue, it could have been something with the bones in the ear...

...And then, when we ask her about school and how she's even still teaching or going to class, she says, ""Oh. Well, I learned how to read lips really fast.""

Ah, I shouldn't have doubted myself. I know of people that have been deaf for their whole lives, and even they have a hard time reading lips. It's incredibly unlikely that my sister picked it up in 2-4 weeks.

She kept up this ruse for six months. She ended up dropping out of school and moving home. People were suspicious, but not actually saying anything or bringing it up to her. Why? We didn't know how.

Meanwhile, this entire time, my mother's husband (our second stepfather, who was actually an amazing man) is going downhill and fast. I started to get actually angry with her for keeping up her ""Oh, I'm deaf, why don't the doctors believe me"" routine while our stepfather's heart was failing very quickly. She went as far as claiming she got TTY service on her phone. When my mother told me that, I sighed and replied, ""I'm sorry. I miss her, but she's taking it too far. I'm not talking to my sister through a stranger.""

Doctors refused to treat her. She shopped around for psychologists until she found one that would buy her story. He diagnosed her, basically, with hysterical deafness in response to some unknown trauma. Meanwhile, she's still able to live her life, and my mother catches her on multiple occasions responding when she couldn't have possibly been able to read her lips (for example, when she was in the next room).

Our stepfather was dying. The entire time, she's focused on how having to bring him to the ER was draining to her, how she is annoyed with dealing with this drama, and why does everything have to be so hard for her....

He died a month ago. Her hysterical deafness claim has just kind of...gone away. No one has confronted her about it. Why? Because the last time someone confronted her, she wrote them out of her life entirely. She may be a pathological liar, but she's my sister, and she's family. Despite everything, she means a lot to me, and I have no idea how the hell to tell her to get help. To not go for the attention ploy - go get help for what causes her to do this. To find out why she craves drama and pity.

Her best friend has now distanced herself and her children from my sister. Why? Because her best friend has two small daughters, and my sister was uncomfortably close - my sister had more pictures of them, and Best Friend was their mother; my sister considered them her own kids. Plus, Best Friend was putting together a number of inconsistencies with the lies my sister had told her, and she just didn't feel it was healthy to be around their family.

I don't know enough about bipolar disorder to claim that lying can be part of it. But really, given her extreme reactions to things, I have to wonder if she has other conditions, such as borderline personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder. I'm not a professional by any means, but I love her, and I know she's not getting the help that she needs.

So...given the situation, does anyone know how to confront a pathological liar? I'm more concerned that this may develop into something more. I just want her to get help before something worse happens.

*Edit:* I also think it's worth mentioning and will never deny the fact that our childhood sucked.

Please help.",22,9,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/j0yy1/reddit_im_really_scared_please_help/,"First, a quick, relevant background on myself.  I am a University-aged girl, and I have had some problems in the past with harassment (from both a boyfriend and men at large) and minor sexual abuse. It started in middle school with guys in my class who would corner me in bathrooms, continued into highschool with a verbally abusive boyfriend, and is now somewhat of a constant presence for me, seeing as that I live, for most of the year, in a large city (I have been groped on the subway, followed for over an hour by a man on two different instances, etc.) 

*That being said*, I **have** been to counseling and therapy and I can, with the utmost confidence, say that I am trying my best to work through it.  I have healthy relationships, including the most amazing mother a daughter could ever ask for, and a wonderful and supportive boyfriend, both of whom have really helped me with this.

*************************

Anyways, for the past couple of years, there has been a problem of a Peeping Tom on the street that I live on in my hometown.  A couple of different women from my street have reported problems with one, but no one had been caught. 

One morning, about two years ago, I was standing in my bathroom after I got out of a shower in the morning, around 6am (i.e. a time where there is really no reason for anyone to be wandering around outside someone’s home). The way my house is set up, if you stand at a certain place outside of my house, on the opposite side of where my bathroom is, and look in through one of the slits in the blinds, you can see into the bathroom.

I happened to glance out of my bathroom because someone else in my house had said something, and I then looked out the window, and saw a man standing there, looking at me.  I screamed, closed the bathroom door, and started to dial 911 (as we had had a noted problem with Peeping Toms), but right before I was about to call, my phone rang.  It was my neighbor, who told me that she had also seen the man looking in, and had already called the police.  Four minutes later, the police show up at my house, one comes to my door to ask if I’m ok, and the other cop caught the guy lurking around another woman’s house.  The police unfortunately didn’t have enough evidence to put him (I’ll give him the pseudonym of XYZ) away, so they let XYZ off with a warning, but they said he was put on a record of some sort, and that he already had a history of warnings for unrelated things. Also, turns out XYZ lives *four houses down from me*.

Fast-forward to today, when I received an e-mail from a different neighbor, linking me to an article, which says that this same man, XYZ, was jailed this past week for luring a minor girl into his home (again, four houses down from me), and then brutally raping her, landing her in the ICU.  He is now in jail on a bond, with a court date set. However, he has four brothers who still live in the house, all of whom have a previous police record similar to XYZ's.  They are also all believed to be part of a gang (which is documented, again, in police records).

Additionally, there have been three other unsolved rapes within a couple of blocks of where I live in the past four years.

****************************************

I would be really, *really* appreciative if anyone had any advice whatsoever as to how to deal with this (especially given my background), both emotionally and ""physically"". I'm home alone for the majority of the days (8am-7pm) that I'm not working, which usually doesn't bother me, but now it's a bit nerve-wracking.

I have gone through counseling, and it helped for a while, but ultimately I feel I am in a fruitless and futile pursuit of skills to which I am incapable of mastering.

I entered college and am still nominally an engineering student. I've worked my ass off by studying for 6-8 hours per day on top of my courses. And yet, my grades fail to reflect the amount of work I put in, and I am now on academic probation. It didn't help that last semester I had mono (not from partying), and my parents were hospitalized for the better part of two months due to a drunk driver hitting their vehicle. Accordingly, this has created a compound anxiety whenever I'm in a testing situation in which I cannot assemble the information I obviously have practiced and possess, therefore doing poorly, and reinforcing the cycle. 

 I am not receiving any aid for college, but due to my parents income (they aren't paying for college), did not receive any benefits from my university or FAFSA. I have had to take out several large loans to pay for my continuing education. 

All in all, it would appear that in spite of an excellent resume coming out of high school, college, and the gateway to doing what I wish to do, is above my intelligence level. Since I have never been particularly skilled in any area besides academics, this is an especial blow to me to be failing/borderline failing. It does not help that my parents constantly remind me of my own shortcomings in spite of my requests that they move past it, blaming my poor grades on ""extracirricular"" activities, of which there were few if any. 

Currently, I am taking an online course in differential equations, and am extremely stressed over a midterm this Saturday. While I have a relatively high mark in the class, the others are far more capable intellectually and the curve is probably going to be extremely high; ergo, even with a 70 or 80%, I will still probably only get a C at best unless I can somehow surpass the average.

I am sorry for dumping this on you. I just feel hopeless, tired, and useless, and am seriously considering ending my life; if I can't do engineering, there is no other point in continuing my life and becoming a drain on everyone around me. If you have any advice, or anything you can do to console me, I would very much value it. ",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_iwo1j,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/iwo1j/suicide_help/,

I'm definitely an introvert, but not a shut-in. I love going out and doing things with friends and partying and everything, it's just that I need some down-time to recharge.

I haven't found a job yet, so I moved back home after I graduated. It's been kind of a boring summer so far. Friends have work and other commitments, so I've just been hanging around a lot. Because of that, I decided to go visit a few friends out in New York City. And here a few days has made me realize how unhappy I am. Let me explain.

One of my friends has a very bubbly personality. He's always smiling, full of energy, and eager to talk to anyone. He just has this ability to connect to anyone he talks to and make friends almost immediately. Some examples: We went to a park where music was being played, and a group of girls had hula hoops. He approached them and started talking, and within minutes he was hula hooping with them and they were taking pictures with him and everyone had a great time. That night, we went to get a beer at a local bar. There were two very cute waitresses, and somehow he got both of them to take a break and come talk with us, and before you knew it, they agreed to stop by the coffee shop he worked at the next day.

So basically, he just has this ability to connect with anyone in a meaningful way. Something I lack the ability to do. With the waitresses, he talked to them about where they lived, how the restaurant was treating them (it just opened), all in a fun and joking way. When I try to make small talk with people, I'm so worried that I won't have something to talk about that I come off as boring and stale and the conversation quickly ends (usually to my relief).

So, I'm not sure what to change in order to get better at this. I'm not happy with my social skills, but at the same time, I rarely have the energy to go out and ""practice"". Right now my friend is at work and I'm at his apartment. The idea of going out, on my own, and trying to replicate what my friend can do, is totally overwhelming and unappealing. But I know my friend would be bouncing off the walls if he were forced to stay by himself for a few hours.

I am going to need an abortion soon. I’ve taken a pregnancy test, and despite being on the pill (we’ve been very precise with timing, and have never missed a pill) and being safe in general, it turned up positive. After a good deal of consideration, we’ve opted not to have it or put it up for adoption. We are not in the right family setting for something like that. Not to mention the lack of funds to pay for doctor’s visits and the amount of stress that would stem from the situation.

We were planning on taking a trip to Planned Parenthood on Saturday to get things sorted out. The problem, though, is that neither of us have enough money for the procedure (We’re told that the procedure costs start at $400).  What we’d like to know is if anyone had any advice as to what we should be expecting/ what we should do as far as money goes. We’d love any other advice involving the procedure as well.

Also, nobody can change our minds about this. He and I have discussed this at length long before this happened, and we are sure that this is the right choice.

I had the chance to win a Spectral Tiger card (WoW collectible, has a card and a digital good redeemable in WoW). It is worth unscratched more or less 600-800 bucks on eBay so I put it there (don't play wow anymore) for 600$ start, 750$ buyout. 2 days in someone bought it, sent me an email asking for the code since he was away (I know I know, never again) and to send him the card after. I got the money, sent the code and waited for news.

Zoom 4 weeks later, a chargeback is filed to the credit card who paid the 750$. A fraud is later filed with Paypal, and I got an account with -700 some money in the Paypal account. Filled everything with conversations and proof that I sent the digital goods.

Fraud case closed without comments two weeks ago. Chargeback case closed 2 days ago, with the comment that ""Paypal was looking for it"", but nothing was left as ""opened"".

I guess I have a couple of choices here:

1. Ask blizzard for fraud, try to get back a working code and make the original code stop. Resell the good to someone who wants me to send the card itself.

2. File a fraud with Paypal and/or eBay. See where that goes. Their help is really shitty as to what the options are, they're basically just saying that they look things up and make decisions.

3. Suck it up... that's a big suck up though and I hope this is not the last option that remains :( If it's the last thing I do, at the very least I'll frame that freaking card over my chimney as a good conversation starter.

The entire time he's been in locked up I've supported him. I send money every month, we talk once a week on the phone and I visit whenever I can. The prison is 4 hours from my house. 

He tells me he's interested in vocational schools. I've sent him information on schools in my area that meet his needs and he's taken the time to write to them and has gotten a positive response (mostly)

When his time is up, he's been invited to live in my home as long as he's working or going to school. 

I'm wondering:
What should I expect?
How long will it take for him to adopt to society again?
What are the signs I should look for to see if things are going well? 
How hard of a line should I take with him? I don't want to jeopardize my wife, my home or my own life. Should there be clear cut rules or would a laid back approach be best.

**TL;DR: fiancé's groin and butt-crack area are sweaty and constantly inflamed/irritated/itchy/burning and we can't figure out how to remedy it.**

detail:

He showers every day, sometimes twice a day because of this problem. He's tried our kid's diaper rash ointment, baby powder,  changing his underwear multiple times a day, using baby wipes throughout the day to keep things as 'fresh' as possible...nothing seems to help. 

He works in an office building and is either sitting at a desk or running to and from other sites in the building all day long. He will come home from work complaining of the burning sensation going on 'down there' and take a shower as soon as he walks in the door. We don't know if it's friction, the lack of 'ventilation' (he's tried regular boxers, boxer briefs, commando....he wears jeans every day), heat and sweat, or a combination of those.  

Something that may also have some bearing here is that he has a skin condition. I'm not sure what it's called  but he's explained it as there's a bacteria that everyone has on their skin, he just has more of it. Because of this, when he gets hot (whether from physically exerting himself or just stepping outside on a hot, humid day) his skin becomes a red, splotchy, itchy mess. The doctor he saw for it (might have been the only time he's ever gone to the doctor!) recommended using  Selsun Blue shampoo on his skin in the shower to keep his outbreaks down and/or to calm any breakout he experiences. 

**edit: he just linked me to the condition (he doesn't know i'm posting this, he thinks i'm researching it on my own...) he has: [Tinea Versicolor] (https://health.google.com/health/ref/Tinea+versicolor) ...i hope i linked that correctly!

In any event he won't go to a doctor and we can't think of anything else to try at this point. 

So. i've told him for months now that I would do this, and here I am. I am asking reddit if they or anyone they know has any experience or advice on the subject. Thank you in advance, and I hope I have not upset anyone by posting...!

**Edit: i showed him this thread last night- thank you for all of your responses! i'm not sure if i've convinced him to go to a doctor yet but he's at least considered the option of me calling and making an appointment for him. He's a little embarrassed about having to actually talk to someone about it, i think.

The thinking is that it looks like a grab for gifts, because that is the whole point of the shower. 

My cousin is having a bridal shower about a 2 hour drive away from me. I have been invited to the shower. There was no word about not being invited to the wedding. I assumed, as tradition and etiquette would dictate, that I would be invited to the wedding as well. I found out from family that I will not be invited to the wedding - only her immediate family and aunts/uncles are invited to the wedding. 

Truthfully - the wedding is several states away and I wouldn't have been able to go anyway - but now I feel like I'm just a way to get a gift. The shower isn't just a party or get together - they specifically included a ton of ""we're registered here!"" slips. 

She is my cousin so I will get her a small gift either way - but had I not been invited to the shower I would have only gotten the 1 gift for the wedding. Now that I'm not invited to the wedding I'm not really sure what I feel most comfortable doing. I feel like I will be seen as rude if I don't show at the shower, but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. The shower is apparently quite large so I'm really just a name on the list of people she had to invite - we've never been particularly close. 

I am very strongly leaning towards sending a small gift along and not going to the shower. I feel like I would just feel out of place there, knowing how we are mostly all being excluded from the wedding. We're good enough to bring her a gift but not to see her get married?

Sorry for the wall of text and I'm not even sure if I'm looking for advice or anything, but I just wanted to put this up so I don't feel the urge to spit vitriol comments at my aunt and if you have any input, feel free to comment.

My father hasn't worked since 2008 and my mom and more recently, my brother, have been supporting our family since then. Over time, he's been experiencing depression and my aunt from dad's side (oldest of 10+ kids) has been helping him with his condition. She's a trained psychologist and to help out with our family's finances, he's been applying for disability. His depression wasn't severe before 2012, so at the time, maybe 2010 on, we didn't have a legitimate case. My father was denied twice, and because of that, he suffered deeper depression because of the stress of not being able to pay our bills. Around late 2011, my aunt suggested he move his case to another state.  To my understanding, this was fraudulent. My family was against the whole thing as it has been keeping him depressed with the constant rejections and we would rather have just waited for him to receive his Social Security benefits.

Because my aunt has a strong influence on my dad, he complied and the rollercoaster ride kept getting worse. He ""moved"" to another state in early 2012 to start the case. The first three months were okay as he was helping around the house with all her chores and fixing things, but the last three months were shocking. My aunt would have a nasty attitude towards him and yell at him for doing ANYTHING not to her preferences. She would hide the food in the house. They got into a bad argument and he left to give each other time to cool off. When he came back, she wouldn't let him in and called the cops.

With this treatment **every single day**: he started losing weight, became increasingly nervous and anxious, and lost his confidence. He came back home summer 2012 since there has been no progress with the case and while he was here, his mood was getting better and he started becoming more healthy again.

He flew back to that state earlier this year for a month or two because his court date was scheduled, and that's when the psychological damage got even worse. He would try to walk around, go to Starbucks, go to his friend's house all day just to avoid my aunt's horrible treatment. Unfortunately, the court date was postponed last minute and then he came back home. He was changed.

He got a new court date recently and prior to going, he started experiencing EXTREME anxiety and body pains because of the anticipation of going back and having to deal with my aunt. Another family relative had to accompany him just so he would feel safer. He won the case and it was clear he was in really bad shape. Probably the worst I've ever seen him. Contrary to how he was before this all started.

He endured **ALL OF THAT** so he could help my family with our finances. And then the dagger: He was excited that he could finally help with our mortgage and my aunt was **livid** that he would want to do that. And that **SHE** would handle his finances. Which I clearly don't understand why she's so against it. Why exactly did he have to endure all those years of wondering if he'll get approved for disability insurance if not to contribute to our family's well-being? The money is **worthless** without the goal. Might as well burn it if he isn't ""allowed"" to help us. Was it only her intention to help *HIM* and not me, my mom and my brother?

Over the past few years, we've welcomed her into our home and let her stay with us for however long and even accompanied her when she got surgery done. In the past, she tried to get close to me and told me that she'd be my ""pillar of support."" But she's clearly destroying my father through her actions. Why is she doing this?

Because of all that stress, he got increasingly worse and had to be hospitalized because his body couldn't handle it.

There are a billion more details but I can't think of them at the moment. If you've read this far, thanks.

EDIT: More on my aunt which may explain her personality better. She and her husband divorced maybe 10-15 years ago. She and her daughter have an estranged relationship. She lives in the other state for whatever reason, but she's always been ""alone."" With all of that, I believe it's just in her nature to be controlling. She took advantage of my father's confidence in her to help him. Similarly in the way she previously wanted to help support me.

I'm blaming her for the damage she did to my father's health, mental and physical. That's not the way to treat somebody you care about. Because of his condition and her understanding of how to influence (and in this case, manipulate) other people, she's exacerbated his condition. 

His situation currently is not fraudulent as he was living in the state when his application was processed and his mental state at the time was extremely dire. He has not (since the beginning of 2012) been capable of working as he has extreme insomnia and fluctuating depression. Since he was approved, the account was moved to the federal offices.

He got released from the hospital today and we're taking the steps necessary to move on from this. We are in the process of pushing her out of the account and have already shut off contact with her.

He moved to Europe on a whim to study about a month ago, but dropped those plans. He started writing odd things on Facebook, such as ""there is no such thing as death, only obsession"". He was staying with a cousin, but after a trip to a festival, something happened (he won't tell me what) and now the cousin is home and my brother is living in a tent somewhere. 

A few weeks before the festival I saw him and he was very strange. He would burst into tears randomly, and there were times where he would just sit and stare at me for periods of about 5 minutes. In those periods, I was completely unable to get a reaction from him. He said in that conversation lightheartedly that he thought he had a mental breakdown a few days earlier, and that he's okay with people thinking he's crazy, because it will ""help them grow up"". 

He's a completely different person than the brother with whom I grew up. He's now completely changed his diet, has stopped taking his blood pressure medication, and wants to be a ""digital nomad"". I am terrified that he will have a stroke somewhere in the woods and no one will find him. 

I'm glad that he is still communicating with my mom and me, but I don't know what to do. I am so worried. I've asked him to seek help, but he won't. I am a medical student, so I'm not yet qualified to make any type of diagnosis, but I think he might be having some kind of manic episode.

We're 23/24 years old, so I feel like it should be okay to fool around from time to time... Also, we have been friends for about 8 years or more, so I don't want to cancel this friendship. Worst thing is that he often gets very angry. Especially if I criticize him or just disagree with something he says.


Any idea, why he does that? Any idea how I can just have a friendship with him without senseless arguements?

At some level he just has to know how distasteful his behavior is.  This neighbor (who I am stuck with for the length of a LONG lease) clearly has no respect for my fiance but professes his admiration for him all the time.  I am angry because I want to really yell at him the next time he touches my bra strap or tells me I'm hot (under his breath, looking straight in my eyes... er... tits...)
   
I am frustrated with not knowing how to react.  I can't avoid him, and I am to the point where I want to tell him off (in front of witnesses) to shame him into submission.  But maybe he IS just some dumb guy that  doesn't know when to frack off.  The real reason I am coming to the hivemind is this:
  
What role would public humiliation play in this situation?  What if I loudly tell him how sick his treatment makes me feel in front of all the other guys we hang out with every night?  He is ignoring a very pointed, specific ""back off"" conversation we had, my staying next to my fiance and away from him during any interaction, my standard retorts (Frack off).  My fiance is keeping an eye on him but the harassment continues.
  
So ladies:  What do YOU do when you have just had ENOUGH and he just wont let up?  What do you do if you have tried direct communication, ignoring it, laughing it off, talking to the fiance...  I feel like my only recourse is to nail him hard in front of all the other guys we hang out with every night (who are all absolutely respectful of my relationship).
  
Men (not ALL men, but there must be someone out there in the vast, anonymous internet):  Why do some of you do this kind of stuff?

She didn't intend to do it all herself, but her business partner quit very early on and she doesn't make enough money to hire anyone else.   She is forever backed up and overworked, and incredibly stressed over the real estate legal issues that crop up.  Last night she worked from 10am to 3am, still wasn't able to accomplish what she needed to, came home miserable, slept a few hours, and went back to work.   

She's been thin all her life, but recently gained 50 pounds in 6 months, (total of about 70 lbs in the last year).   After about 8 months of campaigning I was FINALLY able to get her to go see a doctor, but that was only a baby step, she now needs to go back for bloodwork (she very likely has a thyroid issue), then actually follow through with prescriptions, etc.   It will be very hard to even get her to go to the testing.  Simply going to the doctor was so stressful to her that she spent the rest of the day getting drunk.   It seems like she is leaving her medical issues untreated on purpose, but she is also just really bad at looking after herself to begin with.

She's extremely stressed out and toxic to be around.   She's basically a walking meltdown.  She needs to quit her business, but she claims she ""can't"" because she wouldn't make enough money doing anything else.    (and she wouldn't be eligible for unemployment.)  The money thing is kind of untrue though, because she also complains about only ever breaking-even at work and has actually been living off savings/inheritance the last few months.  

I want her to get an easier, more stress-free job, like at a supermarket or something.  (Which is actually her fantasy…""I just be a walmart greeter"").  I've told her many times I support that, and she should do it.

Really she's just extremely resistant to change, even if it's positive.   I'm not sure she could handle the ""stress"" of the change brought on by closing down her business.  She gets insanely emotional about much more minor things.   

She smokes, doesn't excercise, has gained a ton of weight, and doesn't get enough sleep.   She's at risk for tons of health issues.   The stress from her job is literally killing her.   

I have no idea what to do or how to convince her she needs to start liking herself enough to take better care of herself, let alone do something huge like close down shop and get a more sane job.    She clearly has some emotional issues to deal with, but again, going to the physician once drove her to get drunk… not sure how I could convince her to talk about her feelings with a professional.  (She's spent the last 5 years taking care of first a dying boyfriend, then her dying mother.  But things didn't get better once she no longer had those burdens, only worse).

I feel helpless.  At her current rate she could easily die within a few years.  What can I do to save her?  (I'm already trying to be as supportive/encouraging/non-judgemental as possible.. but i can't get through to her on a level where she takes action)

I backed away from him and avoided conflict until someone could stop him, but he never physically hit me, so the school couldn't do anything about it.
  We're afraid since he loses control of himself and makes a show every time I'm at school(presumably because I'm her boyfriend now), he might actually do something severe when I DO go to school next year.

  They dated for a year due to a case of her feeling trapped at him hurting her if she ever broke up with him, but when I met her, I helped her get through it and supported her until we got together.
  The reason I say this is to introduce that she knows him well enough to know he's mentally unstable and that there is a legitimate fear of him doing the things he's said. 
  
  They broke up around New Years, and between then and the end of May, he was calling her weekly begging and making threats to her, none of which she has recorded. Since Summer he's layed off, but she's still afraid of him.
  She tried to get the school involved, but no one believed her because he acts like an innocent Christian kid in a bible-belt town and she can't be persuasive enough to get people to listen to her. 
 I'm under the impression that people think she's grubbing for attention even though the threats are real, and she's afraid for both of our lives to consider going back to school. Her mom doesn't believe her, and won't let her switch schools or go onto online schooling.
   
 We don't know what to do. We're entering Grade 12 in August, and she's worried that he'll do something like he previously planned like take a gun to school.
   
  We haven't been able to record him saying anything so serious because around the time we started trying, he stopped calling. We know he hasn't gotten over her because even though he stopped calling, he continues to spread rumors and make verbal threats randomly in the hallway about how he'll ""beat me up"" if he ever sees me outside of school.
  I've done nothing to antagonize him, and as to her, I think she's only ever told him to stay away from her.
  
  I would love advice on how to get rid of this problem. We don't have evidence, and the only idea left is to try to coax him into doing something  in a controlled environment that would get him in trouble before he does something serious at an unexpected time where people can't stop him.

We don't really speak to our extended family anymore. They do/did lots of drugs, are extremely rude and disrespectful at group gatherings, my cousin hit on my girlfriend a family reunion, etc...

What's so upsetting about all of this is that my immediate family (mom, sister, and myself) have been extremely close all of our lives. We have never abandoned each other since my extended family has taught us how not to be.

* Current situation:

My sister hasn't spoken to my mom or myself in over 2 months. I'm very upset and worried for her (she was molested as a child by a fellow church member -- we're all atheists now except my mom) because of her past. I've always been her big brother. I've always been there for her and so has my mom. 

* What I think:

My sister seems to be upset because I was laid off work and am currently relying on unemployment to make ends meet and that my mom MIGHT lose her job because her union doesn't seem to want to represent the workers that are being mistreated (my mom stands up for herself and her co-workers as opposed to many others). I'm currently working a side business that is beginning to generate enough revenue to make my full-time job in the near future and the possibility that my mom will get fired is relatively low. 

These tiny bumps in the road, that we all seem to go through, seem to devastate her.I know my sister is really stressed and worried for us, but simply not communicating with your family (my sister didn't even bother to call my mom on Mother's day) is not the way to go. Reddit, how can I fix this!! I'm a guy. Tell me what to do and I'll do it! Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post.

This has absolutely nothing to do with my relationship with my boyfriend, and is not asking for romance advice.

Alright, so, I'm 17, and he's 18. We're both in high school. To put things lightly, his mom is fairly messed up. His dad was really abusive before he left them ten years ago. Her parents were also abusive to her as a child. As a result, she's really paranoid, depressed, and generally has mental breakdowns really frequently.

She takes all of her anger and sadness out on my boyfriend, calling him a terrible person. To put it simply, he's not. He has never done any sort of drugs or had alcohol. He goes to school, takes advanced classes, and gets good grades. He even cleans the house for her and cooks her food. He's really nice to her, too. Despite this, she screams at him, and says horrible things. He comes over to my house really depressed every time this happens.
She's threatened to leave and leave him homeless because she ""couldn't care less"" About him, and because he can ""go fuck himself"" (Yup, direct quotes. Super mature 50+ year old). 

The other day, he got sick at school. Pretty bad chest pains, serious stuff. Talked to school nurse, who told him to get a doctor appointment right away. His mom, instead of consoling him, screamed about how he was a waste of money, and about how much the medical tests will cost. Then, after the doctors told him to go to the ER next time it happens, she said that she ""wasn't taking him to any fucking ER""

She also constantly berates him for being agnostic, instead of really christian like she is, among other things. When he doesn't dress like she wants him to (not anything weird, I'm talking the WRONG COLORED JEANS or WRONG HAIR LENGTH) she screams at him and says he looks like trash. He's trying to get a job, but she won't let him drive, and also cleaning the house/ cooking for her takes up all of his fucking time after school.

He's so nice to his mom, he keeps trying to get her therapy, but she literally refuses to go. The mental abuse he has to go through at home is terrible, and I feel horrible that this is happening. I have no idea what to do to help him. He can def. stay at my house if she leaves, but that's not a permanent solution. He still has another year of high school, no money, and no family financial support. However, things can't go on like this. Thinking that a mother screams at her child and tells him to ""fuck himself"" After he asks for a doctor's appointment is basically incomprehensible to me. His dad beat him all of his child hood, and his bitch of a mother takes it upon herself to continue the abuse, just in a different way.

This morning, she exploded again, threw some of his stuff away, and told him he has to leave. Once again, I quote: ""Get the fuck out, I don't want to see your fucking face again."" I know he's 18, but there's no way a mother can just abandon her high school kid like that and expect him to get a job overnight or something. She really needs some professional help.

Once again, I know he's an adult and it's his house, but this is terrible. She is his MOTHER, and he takes care of her all of the time he's not at school. Wtf. Seriously.

Is there anything I can do to get her help? Should I call the police or something? This is horrible and I can't stand this happening any longer.

1369784465.0,13,self.needadvice,1f8eoq,My sister verbally abuses my mom and doesn't listen to my dad. My dad wanted me to talk to her and now I'm going to court.,19,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1f8eoq/my_sister_verbally_abuses_my_mom_and_doesnt/,"To start off, I live with my mom, dad, and my little sister currently but I also have an older brother and younger sister. My sister is 16 and her name is Michelle and I'm 20. Yesterday my sister ended up throwing bread and fruit in my moms face while holding a knife around the house and my dad told me to talk to her because she doesn't listen to my dad.

My mom makes all the money in the house and pays all the bills. My dad helps with some purchases of food, school supplies, and random purchases for the family through his income but my mom practically makes three times more than my dad. (it's over a 100k difference) My mom and dad argue a lot and their marriage was somewhat rocky a few months ago and I'm not sure how well it is doing now. I still think they like each other at least enough to keep the family together.

If my dad tries to lecture Michelle but she would just say he has no right to tell her anything to do because he doesn't pay any bills in the house and she won't listen to him. She calls out my dad on not having a good education and a bad job and says hes basically useless in the house.

My mom works graveyard shift and usually comes home to yelling from my father. When my sister yells at my mom she lets it happen. She sometimes cries and she feels like everyone is being mean to her. She doesn't punish, scout, yell my sister or I. She will just get really sad. In fact, if Michelle yelled at my mom and then asked my mom for money then she would probably give my sister money. Btw, I go out of my way to be very respectful to my mom now but I feel she doesn't appreciate it and I'm fine with that as long as I'm not adding negativity to her life. So I'm not implying I'm being mean to her as well. 

This is a conflict between my mom and my sister and I'm not sure if my dad was present at the moment. My sister is always making my mom feel bad for things around the house.

For example; My mom put granola cereal in a jar that my sister puts oatmeal in. My sister yelled at my mom for this and I woke up to it in the morning and then called my mom a piece of shit. 

I've tried to talk to her in the past but she will say it's none of my business or that I have no right to say anything because I started community college over after being 2 years in because I wanted to do Engineering and not Nutrition Science. And she keeps a 4.0 gpa and wants to go to a good school.

I remember once I was in the kitchen and my mom was trying to cook a ham. She asked my sister ""do I have to add water to this ham?"" and my sister was saying ""No, you don't. I've told you this already. You should have listened the first time mom."" so I said ""we all make mistakes and forget sometimes Michelle"" and she switches the subject to ""So how are you doing in college LJ"". (my nickname)

So, I tried to talk to my sister today when she got home. I was home alone and she entered the house. I told her she has to be nicer to my mom. She told me it was none of my business. I ended up telling her to stop yelling at our dad as well for over feeding our dog because she is always saying the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

She said it was none of my business and I have no right to say anything. I started yelling and saying she causes mom too much stress. She is VERY passive aggressive and she starts smiling and chuckling. So I pushed her and she fell on her backpack. She ended up going into her room which we were in front of and I stood in front of the door. She said get out of the room and how she didn't want to hear it but I said no, so she called the cops. I live in Connecticut which has strict domestic violence laws so I have to go to court now. I don't think I handled it well and I didn't know how do approach this at all.

A few months ago I told my friend about how my sister abuses my mom and acts like she owns the house with trying to control my mom and he told me that I needed to sit down and talk to her but I know she won't listen to me from past experience because she will bring up how I used to be very angry and take out my anger on my other sister Danielle or how I'm going to community college. (which was by choice because I'm very undecided) Even those arguments I feel are very superficial. It was past events that happened over 2 years ago and I didn't physically abuse someone until I pushed my sister Michelle today. 

So end of story, cops came and I have to go to court tomorrow because when domestic violence happens in a household then an arrest has to be made.",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_1f8eoq,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1f8eoq/my_sister_verbally_abuses_my_mom_and_doesnt/,

I'm about to graduate. Stats here so it's easier to grasp my background:

* Big Ten school (prolly doesn't matter)
* Double Major in Political Science, Global Studies, minor in Asian American Studies. My minor actually gave me more opportunities (internships, scholarships, etc.) than my majors.
* Super seniors due to double major, but I don't mind.
* $45k in school debt, or a bit under. I went to CC too, just went loan crazy after I transferred. Biggest mistake ever.
* Graduating with a 2.8-2.9 GPA.
* Had a great summer internship at a very large and prominent Asian American non profit in DC (think NCAACP but not as vocal).
* Student group President, multiple working experiences on campus, decent professional network
* My personal trait is that I can be highly incompetent and lazy. I have no clue how to fix this.

I guess my concern is... school was a safe grounds. I enjoyed it. I had bills but I scraped by. But now the loans will catch up to me. I will have to find a REAL job. I'm pushing to finish my degree but come May 19th, it's all over and I will be sitting at home doing who knows what until I find something. That scares me. Going from ""doing this and this"" to ""I have nothing, atm"".

Problem is, I have no clue what to find. I have been talking to a Navy Officer recruiter for a few weeks but he sort of lost interest in me because my application has a hang up (I suppose once that hang up is clear, he will contact me again).

I also applied to graduate school. I met the director of the program and, well, basically she's a huge bitch. She may or may not be reflective of the program and staff but I can't afford graduate school, so I am throwing that out of the window now. So I'm sort of in a pickle, just waiting to graduate, waiting for my Navy OCS application to be OK'd.

I realize that I'm not a trained professional, and that it's entirely possible that I'm being a hypochondriac, but after several years of treatment for mild depression, which at the onset, seemed to help alleviate some of the behavioral issues associated with my pervasive depressed mood, I find that my mood swings, insecurity, low self-worth, and poor perception of how others interact directly with me is severely affecting my ability to function in any kind of social situation. 

I act aggressively and defensively towards anyone who is even remotely close to me. Any situation where the slightest bit of dissonance is present, rather than interacting in a calm and logical manner, I automatically and aggressively defend myself when there is absolutely no threat present outside of what I am perceiving. More times than not I am anticipating attacks so frequently that I will begin interactions in a preemptive offense position. What is even worse is that while I am reacting in this manner, I am unaware and do not realize what I've done until I've hurt someone or angered someone and they have pointed out my hostile and unreasonable behavior. 

I cannot break away from the idea that everyone I am close to or could become close to will find me wanting, grow tired of me, and eventually abandon me for more exciting and engaging prospects. I literally freeze up when I am invited or prompted to share my thoughts and feelings on any subject, for fear that my ideas will further reinforce the other party's disgust with me and I would rather stay mute than have those around me think me unintelligent or not worth associating with.

EDIT:Wow, I didn't expect so many comments! Thanks!

I'll reply to some, but from what I have been reading, I decided I will keep following this rule.
The only reason that I wanted to stop was because for the past week I've been pretty busy with work, homework and the new restaurant they (my parents) opened up which I'm made to work at so I got pretttty behind. (170 pages) and so I can't drive currently. I was angry because he wasn't being understanding of the fact that I have been busy (helping him!) and still taking my car. 

Also, I did kinda figure this was sort of a first world problem, but I don't believe that because you have a minuscule problem compared to someone in poverty, you should just suck it up and not try at least to make it better. But maybe this isn't a good example for that.

The car is theirs, but I pay for all my gas, insurance and repairs.
I don't exactly pay for my phone, but I have to keep the house clean in order for them to pay it.

I guess the idea is just to have someone to come clean with. I want to have someone who will understand my thoughts and motivations, me, when I am gone. A truthful legacy.

The problem is that when I think of the person I would want to tell and would actually like to hear a response from, a person comes to mind but she and I aren't very good friends, at least not ""oh and by the way I am going to kill myself"" kinda friends. She is a friend of one of my ""closer"" friends so we see each other mostly in group situations or, if its just us, for something like lunch in between classes, always in daylight.

I'm so sorry for how long this is but I need help. I have always had a terrible relationship with my mother and father. We never ate dinner together growing up, they often ignored my feelings when I was a child, and a slough of other things. I cooked my own meals since childhood, taught myself how to tie my shoe, and other things that  are just sad. I also have never had a conversation with my sister. I still don't talk to my parents about anything and I firmly believe that my parents don't know me at all as a person. They have never been loving nor supportive. And I don't like them. Either of them.

**About me:** I am self-motivated and smart. I had straight A’s all throughout high school, several clubs and activities, have already been accepted to a prestigious private university this past December. I have never gotten into trouble, I have always been responsible, and have never needed my parents to do anything for me except give me rides and sign school papers. I got a part job last summer and have ever since funded my own purchases, although they are still paying for my $55,000 university (no financial aid, we make ~150k) because where am I supposed to get that kind of money. I currently work 22hrs/week on top of school and am looking for a second job. I will be moving across the country to attend said university starting in August. 

**Why I’m posting today:** I got into a fight with my dad last night. He wouldn’t let me go out with my friends after work (10pm). I asked him why, and he said it’s because he’s sick of me sleeping late, he’s sick of me going out to places he doesn’t know with people he doesn’t know and me doing things he doesn’t know. Of fucking course he doesn’t know, he doesn’t know anything about me, and what the fuck difference would it make? I told him he’s being a jerk because I’ve never caused trouble, I always come home safely, I am extremely responsible and I never bother anyone in the family. Really, the only time any problem arises with my father is when I try to go out. He always texts me at midnight and says “Go home.” I text him “yeah” or “k” and sometimes I go home or sometimes I just take my time coming home until he texts me something like “You are home in 5 minutes” or “Home! Now!” Just because I think he’s being a fucking dick for making me go home (I spend my entire day studying or working). I eventually come home, he SAYS NOTHING to me, doesn’t even acknowledge me, I just walk to my room and sit in silence while my friends are out without me having fun. Last night, I didn’t even get to go out since he said “You are going home and you wll sleep. Stop this tantrum.” You fucking serious? I told him he’s treating me like I’m 13. But please, even if I'm wrong here, read the rest of the post...this is nothing. 

**THE ISSUE AT HAND:** As a result of my upbringing (and perhaps a couple other early childhood things), I have developed severe self-esteem issues that made me begin cutting myself at age 11. I have depression and anxiety and have had thoughts of suicide since that age. 

When I was 13, my father noticed the scars on my left arm. These are pretty severe, raised, obvious scars...there's tens of them. I can't remember if I had any fresh cuts that day. He asked ""what happened?"" I said ""nothing."" He said ""did the cat scratch you?"" I said ""yeah."" The conversation was dropped. Nothing was ever said again about those scars. There is no way my cat could have scratched me that many times, in that many directions, with such varying severity of each cut. I don't know if my father is dense or what, but that was that.

Then, in junior year of HS when I was 17, my anxiety was at its peak. I was having at least one panic attack a week and I was in absolute desperation. I was extremely stressed out with school because of the number of classes and responsibilities I had, all while having horrible self esteem issues, no friends at school, and struggling with keeping my relationship with my boyfriend who moved across the country. I lost all of my friends and my boyfriend broke up with me because he could not handle my volatility and self destructive thoughts/actions. I began self-harming again after a few-year hiatus. This time I would cut my arm, whip myself with a heavy studded belt, smoke cigarettes, purposely take higher doses of whatever medicine I was taking, hoping that these things would slowly move me closer to death. I sought professional help, starting (and ending) at school. The school counselor decided that I needed to see an actual mental health professional, and said that the only avenue through which I could see somebody at that point was to notify my parents. And notify my parents she did. She called my mother and explained to her that I have been going through severe emotional turmoil and that I need to get professional help. My counselor reported back to my that my mother sounded dutifully concerned. But you know what? Nothing happened. My mother NEVER spoke to me about it. EVER. My father never said a thing. Neither of my parents did anything for me. I was 17 (under the age of majority) and could do nothing for myself. I continued harming myself, continued lashing out at people and losing my friends, continued living my life alone, quit many of my activities, let my grades slip, lost my will, my drive, my motivation. 

Later that year, I opened up to my father about how I was feeling for the first time in my entire life. Mind you I’ve never spoken to my father about anything so personal. I had stayed home from school that day and I fought with him that morning because he said I stay home too much, he said I’m just faking it, that I’m lazy and need to stop slacking off, he said just go the fuck to school. I texted him (I can’t talk to him in real life.) about my troubles. The text read, “Do you think I WANT to be up late? Do you think I WANT to never sleep? I don’t get why it’s not plainly obvious that I’m having so much trouble with school and the amount of homework I have. A school counselor called mother to tell her that I’m having a hard time concentrating and neither of you did a thing for me! So I have no damn choice but to continue doing my homework all night and continue suffering because you never take me seriously!” I couldn’t tell him anything else about my anxiety, or anything. I figured this text would be enough for him – it was the first time in my entire life that I have tried to cry for help. First time I’ve even spoken to him. 
 
Now my father is the kind of person who thinks he always knows the answer. If I have a problem, he thinks he knows exactly why. Here is this response text: “Then why you took so many classes that you cannot handle? What’s a point? You sleeping at day and then doing your homework at night. No wonder you cannot concentrate. You are bullying me. I am [at work]. You will survive.” And that was that. (We moved to the USA 13 years ago hence his broken English). That was his response, that was the end of the conversation. His perception of exactly what is wrong with me: I have too many classes, and my sleeping schedule is backwards, and that is why I cannot concentrate. End of story. I don’t know what I was expecting, I just thought maybe a loving parent would tell me a little more like they’re upset that I’m having such a hard time and offer me some help.  


That is it – that’s where I am today. I am still struggling. I wish I could make enough to move away from home but I can’t, especially not since my college is across the country. My self-esteem is terrible - I won't detail my destructive thoughts on here. It's getting hard for me to climb out of bed or do my laundry and god don’t even make me go out to the store to get something. I just can’t. I’m stuck here, my parents won’t listen, and I don’t know how to get help. On the bright side, I am 18 now. I don’t know. What do I do about my situation? My parents will never listen to me. I want to fix myself, which may require my parents to drive me to a psychologist, and pay for the appointments, but how am I even supposed to get to the point that I'm seeing a psychologist if my parents won't listen? I've considered many times just overdosing, just doing some severe harm that will REQUIRE medical attention, just so my parents will finally take my issues seriously. I think it's the only way. 
I don't even want to have a good relationship with them, I vomit at the thought of having to speak to them. I just need to get help and that's it. 
 
Thank you so much for reading. I don't tell this to anybody at school because I don't think they can help me. I really need your help...thank you all for your time. 

EDIT = one more concern, if I piss my father off too much, does he have the right to not pay for college? It will cost him $200,000 over the four years, he gets paid a LOT, and I get paid less than $9/hour... I will have no way to pay...

Increasing desire for violence towards others.,17,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/142ffv/seems_to_be_the_beginning_of_the_end_for_those/,"I am no longer empathizing with others.  I can actually trace what is happening within me, and I can tell it will not end will for other human beings around me.  This is so frustrating, this isn't at all what I used to be like, I used to care about others, I worked in the medical field and went to college, and had friends.  All of that is gone now, and I hate people.

I'll try to keep this simple.  Basically, I was kicked out of my living situation at my university because they believed I was an alcoholic.  I had made amazing friends there, and was weaning myself off my alcohol dependency (which I started out of anxiety about being around other people).  I had been being treated for mental issues for a while there (the school mandated that I do so), they said I was schizophrenic.  I resisted taking meds.  

After being kicked out, I moved back home because I had nowhere else to go.  My parents do not believe in mental illness, and are pretty much religious nuts.  They have not helped me acquire care at all.  So I have been shutting parts of my brain off, little by little.  When I try at life, I have noticed I come to radical conclusions, so I just ignore myself now constantly.  I just started telling myself I was worthless, I asked myself why I even deserve to ""be crazy"" and have people help me.  Maybe that was just me looking for a more exciting life, and if I just settle down and become content with not going to school (because thinking sets me off) and not having any friends (I've been withdrawn from all my friends for several months now) I wouldn't even need mental health counseling.  

If I can FORCE myself to just work and continue stifling other parts of my mind, why shouldn't I?  If I can pretend to be normal, no matter how painful that is, why shouldn't I?  If that means avoiding friendship altogether because it causes stress that leads to behavior that appears ""crazy"" why not do it right?

HERE IS THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.  I am becoming increasingly disposed to violence and hatred of other human beings.  My dad, my sister come to me with their problems, with the things that depress them, and I despise them for it.  If I had their ""problems"" the world would look like a much brighter place for me.  Problems with their co-workers, a friend who said something mean, problems learning a certain part of their math homework.  

HOW CAN I EMPATHIZE WITH THESE PEOPLE WHEN I HAVE DECIDED TO DEPRIVE MYSELF OF THESE PLEASURES!?  I have lost my ability to even learn, and I am supposed to feel sorry for someone who feels entitled enough to GO TO COLLEGE!?  I gave up on trying to finish college just so my family and those around me could think I'm NORMAL DAMNIT.  Feel sorry for someone who just had a kid die in a fire?  HELL NO.  At least that person felt the ability to become attached to another thing.  My social difficulties can't let me do that.  Even feeling sad is a luxury I can barely feel anymore.  So in general.  I hate humanity.  I want to hurt others.  There they all are, living their lives, having friends, jobs, learning, all the while telling me to just ""snap out of it"" and ""be normal.""  So I fucking shut nearly my entire mind off in order to avoid appearing mad.  

I just can't do it.  I can't stand by while those around me pretend their lives are horrible while they deny me even the right to try at life.

My mom will make me feel bad and be angry with my for wanting to move in with him, and will suspect it's because he will allow me to do something she won't. However, that is not the reason why. I honestly think I might be happier living at my dad's house, and it's possible my reluctance may only be because I've lived with my mom for so long. Any advice?


**Full story and background:** 

My parents divorced 8 or 9 years ago, and I've lived with my mother since then. My father only lives a couple towns over, maybe 20 miles away, so I usually go over to his house every other weekend, for a month during summer, and some school breaks. I'm currently a junior in high school, but am in a state program that allows me to take college courses instead, so I only go to school a couple days a week, and moving wouldn't affect that. 

I have various reasons for wanting to move in with my dad. My room at my mom's is in the basement, it's a very small house, there's mold in the basement  (not a ton, but it's present), and I have reason to believe my mom has been taking money from my savings account, roughly $150. Not a ton of money, but I know for a fact that she is at least lying about the balance in the account. She claims there's a certain amount, but I went into the bank and was told differently, and I did not take the money out. She believes that I can't access this information, so she continues to lie to me about it.
 
Additionally, any time I need to purchase a book for school, or need new clothes, or something like that, my mom makes a huge deal about the cost of items, yet spends just as much money on things like coffee, getting her car repaired, etc. and doesn't say anything about the cost. I'm not trying to sound entitled to all of these things, as I understand things are expensive, and have even gone as far as to purchase some of my own textbooks for college and such just so I don't have to hear about it. My dad makes less money than my step-dad, who is the sole provider at my mom's house, yet he does not complain. At my mom's I feel kind of like an asshole for asking for help purchasing clothes or textbooks, even though I think I shouldn't. I'm not ungrateful in any way. 

I have a job at a store, but can transfer to another location if I were to move, and I'll get more hours. The one thing holding me back is that I know my mom will make me feel like shit for wanting to move in with my dad, and to be honest, I'll probably feel kind of bad. I'm not sure why. It might be because I've lived with my mom for so long. I think my mom will think I'm moving in with him because he will allow me to get a motorcycle while she won't, but that's not the reason, at all. I honestly think I might be happier living at my dad's house.

Has anyone ever found a mother or father through child support checks?,16,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/xn6et/i_dont_really_know_where_else_to_ask_this_has/,"I'm an 18 year old female living with my single mom in Washington. When I was around 1 or 2, my parents divorced and my dad moved to Utah when I was around 4 to take care of my sick grandmother. He tried his best to be a part of my life. When he still lived near me, I would stay with him on the weekends. When he moved, he would still come to visit me. Eventually, he couldn't risk leaving my grandmother alone so I visited him twice in Utah, once in December 2001 then August 2002. This was the last time I saw him and talked to him.

In 2002, my mom had to change our phone number and remove us from the phonebook due to death threats she had been receiving. We moved soon after due to monetary problems.

In 2007, one of my cousins in Utah found me through social networking. He told me that my grandmother had died in 2005, and my father had moved in with his family for a while and was taking some photography courses or something at the local college. Then one day, he just disappeared with my uncle's camera and no one has seen or heard from him since. Another one of my cousins had told me that during the time he lived with them, my dad was severely depressed about not being able to find me and that may have been one of the main reasons he disappeared, maybe to escape the pain or something.

Fast-forward to today. One hour ago, my mom checked the mail and found a child support check. These had stopped ages ago for us, so she ran in and told me what she had found and told me to try calling around to different agencies and stuff to see if they'd disclose any information about where he's living or working. I called and was transferred to my case officer's phone, where I'd left a message since she only works Monday through Thursday or something.
Do any of you think it's possible that I'll be able to find him through the state? Or is this just a lost cause? I really need to know because I miss him so much and I just want him back in my life. Getting this check at least let me know that he's still alive, so I am more than thankful for receiving it.

**TL;DR: Received a child support check through the state from my father who has been missing for 11 years.

People seem to like me and accept me, but I'm never invited anywhere nor do they ever text me when they're going to meals. I usually find them on my own (although they never complain that I eat with them), or I'll text them when they're going to meals.

My guess is that I'm awkward and unintentionally annoying. In fact, one of the people in the groups I normally eat with, ""Bob"", called me annoying and indirectly asked me to leave. No one there in the group defended me, although one person later texted me and said don't take it personally (and Bob's opinion wasn't representative of the entire group). 

These people do live in other parts of the dorms, and they hang out frequently. I'm at a disadvantage for being in a different room.

I've made friends, but at times I feel awkward and/or unliked (or maybe that's just me). 

When I ask people if they want to do something on the weekend, I'm told they're busy with other stuff. A whole bunch of guys rushed frats. I tried rushing twice and failed. (I'm not a partier or a drinker, so maybe it was for the best. Besides, a lot of the senior frat bros come off as douchebags.) One guy I texted about weekend plans hasn't responded to me, and another person who I facebooked said he was going home for the weekend (even though spring break was last week). My instinct says that people are doing stuff without me on purpose, although that may just be stemming from unresolved issues (and maybe all of these issues are in my head and I just have to deal with being alone on the weekend).

I'm part of one organization on campus, but that's it. Everything else is uninteresting to me (and there seems to be a lot of Greek representation in these organizations, including student government). I'm a film major so I'm looking for sets to crew, but it's not every weekend.

I'm in counseling trying to figure out what to do, but I'm so fucking lost.

TL;DR - I'm having trouble socially in college. I think people like me, but when I ask people if they're interested in doing something over the weekend they say they're busy. I can't help but wonder if these people are purposely doing stuff without me. There's nothing really interesting on campus. I think if I died tomorrow nobody would care.

1333058203.0,15,self.needadvice,rjx2r,Given an ultimatum from toxic parents and I don’t know what I should do. ,26,11,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/rjx2r/given_an_ultimatum_from_toxic_parents_and_i_dont/,"I have a toxic and dysfunctional family who is physically, psychologically, and verbally abusive.

I’m 18, graduated high school last year, and currently living at my parents’ house as a failure.

I did go on to university in the fall… I went to the University of Waterloo for Computer Science. I did horrible in my first term. I failed Honours Calculus, withdrew from Advanced Intro to CS (I had epically failed both midterms), and nearly failed Honours Algebra (passed by 1%). I need the calculus and algebra for my degree, but I didn’t have to take the advanced CS. 

This was a punch in my self-esteem. I had graduated high school at the top of my class (95% avg) and math was one of my strengths. Moreover, most of my self-esteem depended on my academics. I was suicidal in high school and the reason I gave myself to keep struggling on was that I did well in school. It was my bit of hope and I wanted all my hard work to pay off. With this loss, I’m suicidal again…

Since I did so horribly and now had to repeat three courses for my next term, I decided to temporarily withdraw from university. I wanted to fix myself so that I wouldn’t make the same mistakes again. I believe part of the reason I did so bad was that I went to a shitty high school that underprepared me. But I have bigger problems… I have clinical depression and anxiety issues. I’m a maladaptive perfectionist… These mental health problems hugely impact my studying.

So my plan was to return to UW for CS after fixing and improving myself. Enter my toxic and controlling parents. They don’t want me to back to doing CS, especially my mom. They don’t think I’m good enough. My dad blames my failure on me. I’m too lazy. I’m not trying hard enough. God forbid my failure was perhaps linked to their years of abuse which gave birth to my mental health issues.  

They want me to go into nursing. Ryerson nursing. They want me to live at home and be a commuter. I might as well just kill myself now. I don’t want to be a nurse. I don’t think I’d be good a being a nurse. Although I am empathetic and compassionate, I don’t like people that much. I’m also an introvert. I don’t think I have enough energy to be a nurse. When I try to picture myself as a nurse, I see misery. But they don’t care. They think if I go to become a nurse, I’m guaranteed a job.
Also… I don’t want to live another 4-5 years with my family. I hate them. I am the scapegoat and the outcast. I need to get away from them. But I don’t have the resources. I don’t have money. And I am ill. But who gives a damn if I’m ill, because society (and my family) thinks mental illnesses are sad excuses to be “lazy”.

I took the time off to study and attempt to cure my mental issues, but I find myself too wrapped up in anxiety to do anything productive at all. It doesn’t help that the tuition for UW CS is ~$10k/year. And then the living costs… 

“Get a job!” you say. But there are problems with that too.  First of all, I’d need to make money before I move out. That means I have to continue to live with my abusive family until I make enough money. If I want to get out asap, I’d have to work full-time. But I need to dedicate a lot of time to studying too. It doesn’t help that I have depression which keeps my energy levels at a burnt out low. I am always tired and exhausted, mentally and physically, every fucking day. But who cares because my pain is invisible, right? It’s not like you’d yell at a cancer patient that they’re lazy for not getting a job.

I only have five more months till fall term begins again.

I don’t know what to do.

I should also mention that my parents threatened to cut off all support if I choose to go back to UW for CS. They’ve given me an ultimatum, typical of toxic parents. And the tuition is freaking expensive (at least here in Canada). Also, I’d need to make my own arrangements for moving out and getting all my stuff into my new place. They will pretty much be disowning me.

I am already $6k in debt cause of my first term… I need to somehow pay OSAP back soon.

I only have one close friend who is also my boyfriend.

I want to die.

Help.

**TL;DR** Abusive parents gave me an ultimatum – they’ll cut of all support if I don’t do as they say. I have mental health issues and lack resources. I feel like I’m at a dead end and should just kill myself.

I've known him and worked with him for about 7 months now.  He has bothered me ever since the first day.  Every time we are in the same space together, I am filled with this unbearable hatred and irritation.  I honestly can't stand it.  

He's 21 or 22 I think and goes to a nearby community college for programming.  He is one of those people who never matured beyond puberty and doesn't realize it.  He speaks in internet memes and swears using words like ""goram"" from Firefly.  He literally says ""squeeee"" when excited and ""iiinnnerestings"" when something is interesting.  When asked how he is, he's always in Eeyore's state of ""oh, just hanging in there"" or ""okay, I guess"".  He is obsessed with letting everyone know about the knife in his car and has some sort of complex about optimal driving routes not taking the highway.  He will describe these routes slowly and in great detail to anyone who will listen - exactly how he tells every story.  He's across the table from me right now, and as I sit here, he just did one of his long sighs.  He's always sighing about something.  Loudly.  He also says very often ""this will be fun"" or ""tonight/this weekend will be fun"" in an extremely sarcastic voice.  It's like he's in a constant state of dreading everything he's planning on doing.  He breathes with his mouth open, has a blank look in his eyes all the time...  He is quite possibly the least self-aware person I have ever met in my entire life.  He makes every social interaction awkward.  To make things worse, he has a girlfriend now (she's not exactly a catch) and he will use any opportunity to talk about plans with her or his weekend with her, loudly emphasizing the word ""girlfriend"" and never calling her by name.  

I do administrative work for the company we teach classes under, and am at HQ for several hours before other instructors need to show up to pick up supplies.  This person for some reason finds it necessary to arrive sometimes 2 hours before he needs to be here, and sit across the table from me with his sighs and loud breathing, occasionally laughing about something on the internet.  He treats it like a hangout.

I've ranted way too much.  It's just that this has been bothering me for so long, and I haven't really let it out.  I know that I shouldn't hate this person.  He's not mean.  He hasn't harmed me in any way.  He just bothers me.  I feel rage and intense annoyance every second he's around.  What should I do about this?  How do I snap out of it?

Last Monday, she started claiming that she was seeing different visions. Over time, she started having different epiphanies or realizations, and she started to 'learn' how she was a reincarnation of John Lennon, and Jesus, and a number of other historical figures. She became obsessed that her father was a Freemason, and that the government wanted her dead. She came up with all sorts of plans to create a band that would change the world, and she went out to buy a harmonica and panpipe, despite not knowing how to play either. She intends to go to a college campus and busk, in order to get money and friends and band members, even though she has no idea what she is doing. She has digging up old relics of her past and attributing mysterious powers to them, like crystals and gemstones that she claims give her elemental powers, and an old pocketwatch that she believes can help her control time. She thinks that she has tapped into the Akashic record and can view any memory or knowledge throughout history. She thinks that she is the epitome of many human 'archetypes' that appear in different fictional accounts, and she considers herself to be some sort of ultimate human being that will change the world. She has been trying to craft a powerful suit of equipment with her 'artifice' powers, and it's a terrible hodgepodge of junk and crafts... goggles mixed with a Cherokee headband, sandals and fingerless gloves reinforced with brass hinges, a martial art gi with sleeves torn off combined with a bandolier made from a belt, and a HUGE faux-fur-lined winter jacket (despite living in Florida!). She now has a knife, a stungun, an eight-foot whip, a practice sword and two pistols that she gathered for the coming 'revolution' that she is prophesying. She keeps claiming that I am Earth element, but currently 'too Law', but that if I join her band I'll be able to help her change the world and get rich. She has created her own bizarro religion based on a combination of fictional sources like the Tractates Cryptica Scriptura from Philip K. Dick's VALIS and the parody religion of Discordianism, and she claims that she is trying to distill the truth from her Celtic and Buddhist and Cherokee and other heritages, despite not having any sort of Buddhist heritage (or most others) at all! And since she started on Monday, she HASN'T STOPPED TALKING! She went one night without sleeping at all, and another night she slept until 3 AM when she woke up and started SINGING and she never went back to sleep at all.


It doesn't help that she has a best friend who lives with us and has been supporting her throughout the whole thing! She practically worships my wife and now she has called herself the first member of my wife's 'Cult'. And she just acts as an antagonist to me, supporting my wife and agreeing with her crazy ideas! And since my wife feels so productive because she believes she has finally found meaning and purpose to her life, she ignores any of my attempts to warn her. She thinks she can't have a mental disorder because she can't have a disorder when she is completely functional and happy. But everything about her seems like a textbook case of a sudden manic episode, and she matches everything about grandiose delusions! I know that I'm in no position to diagnose based on wiki articles, and that it's bad behavior, but it's all I have. I wrote that whole paragraph above to show just how fucking serious this is, and she wasn't always like this. Just last Sunday everything was fine. I'd been married to her for four years now, and she has never been like this at all.  She's had the occasional bout of depression, but nothing serious and she hasn't taken any sort of medication for years, just some female hormones that she requires.


Earlier this afternoon, she told me that she knew I disagreed with her actions and didn't believe her divine claims, and she didn't want to keep hurting me and making me unhappy, so she took her friend and the two of them packed up much of her stuff and moved out. I wasn't expecting that at all, and I have no fucking idea what this means or what I should do now. She left just an hour ago, and it's past 9 and I'm alone in my house and I don't know who to call or what to do. I don't believe she is a physical danger to herself (she has weapons but has always treated every single one with the proper safety rules and respect) so I don't think I can or should Baker Act her.... Can I force her to see a doctor any other way? She doesn't have insurance that covers this sort of thing, and I don't know what I can do for someone who refuses to acknowledge that they have a problem. But my wife just walked out the door while under serious delusions, and I have got to do something. Please, please help me. I swear to God every word here is true.

My first priority is getting her home, so I called her at midnight and she agreed to have the three of us meet up sometime tomorrow or Tuesday to talk and decide about coming back home. She left because she was worried about distressing me, so I'll just have to prove that having her home and safe is what matters the most to me. I'm feeling better on this step now.

I've already found a good behavioral psychiatric facility in the area that provides free assessments and potential outpatient and inpatient services. I'm going to call them tomorrow to see about setting up an appointment. My wife is very intelligent and reasonable (at least normally) and I have faith that she will agree to this appointment, if only to try to prove herself right.

I'm heartbroken and scared as shit, and a lot of comments realistically point out the dangers here, but at least I'm taking a first step.

About a month ago I ordered some product for one of our clients. Client checked over everything, I checked over everything, I make the order, everyone's happy! Product comes in about a week ago, client picks it up,and everything is o.k.

Fast forward to today and the client calls me and essentially tells me that everything is o.k. with the product, except for one tiny detail that I totally fucked up, which essentially renders it all unusable. Product can not be returned, and my company will be on the hook for the cost of re-ordering the product (roughly $1500, which I know isn't a huge amount, but it's a fair bit for a small company). 

Unfortunately I made a similar, although less costly mistake about a week ago. In that case though it was largely the clients error, and my boss while not very happy with me, he essentially just left me with a ""Well, ohimsofucked, just don't let it happen again.""

And well now this has happened.

I am, however in the unique situation at the moment where my boss doesn't know about this latest screw up, this client deals primarily with me, and rarely with my boss. In theory, if I had to I could re-order the product on my own, and pay the replacement cost out of pocket, which would hurt me, but less so than, you know, not having a job.

I hear talking about your stress reduces the stress itself, but that really isn’t even the problem. I can’t do work. It started with your average procrastination, in high school I would often complete assignments the hour before they were due, or maybe over lunch, but I would still more-often-than-not get all my work done. The problem seems to be that I keep pushing my boundaries, my first two papers this term were done the mornings of my respective classes, ending with me pushing “print” and running out the door. Perhaps the B/B+s I received on these papers pushed me the wrong way into a hole I can’t seem to get out of. Whenever I have an assignment now, I tell myself I won’t repeat my mistakes, that I’ll get it done that night. What ends up happening, invariably, is that I stay up til 4 procrastinating before I finally decided “I’ll get the sleep I need and do it in the morning.” 

But in my endless quest for self-destruction, I have now begun to stop even doing that. Never before have I found myself lying to teachers about assignments, excuses: sure, but lies? The problem is that, at the times they are created, the lies have bits of truth in them, I really AM sick, but yes I probably could have dragged myself up to class, but that would mean I’d have to be confronted by the teacher about the “paper” I had emailed earlier, which in reality was nothing more than a document of nonsense that I purposely corrupted so it wouldn’t be readable. By not checking my email and feigning much-worse illness than I really have, I feel as though I have a legitimate excuse to not have “received” whatever emails the teacher may have sent back about my document not opening. I did this with an essay that was due three weeks ago, and I still haven’t written it. The worst part is, I know my professors are all understanding people, some of them probably would have given me extensions (in fact, one did, in an email I didn’t check for 6 days after yet another corrupted file was sent), and understood. I just feel so trapped, I think now that the idea of facing them is keeping me from doing work more than anything else. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what’s going to happen and it scares me to death. 

I have a final essay due tomorrow that I haven’t yet started, in the same class that I have that essay due three weeks ago, and three other assignments to boot. I have another essay to write as well, that one was only due last week. I want to talk to a counselor, but I’m worried that I can’t tell them the full truth or I’ll get in trouble, and the thought of lying more to anyone makes me sick. I don’t know how to get myself to do work, I try listening to music, working in absolute quiet, in my dorm room, in the library, in the hallway. I always end up distracting myself to the point where it’s actually absurd how much time I’ve wasted.

(Sorry, lots of text).",18,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/mlcr6/my_family_is_going_to_be_very_disappointed_in_me/,"Hi, I'm in a bit of a pickle, and I'm wondering if anyone can offer some advice on how to handle a sticky situation. Just a bit of background info: I'm 19 (male), and I'm in my 2nd year of university doing an engineering degree. My family is very academically oriented, i.e. they both have at least one master's degree from university and my sibling is a straight-A law student. 


This last semester was extremely tough for me. I never told anyone else this, but I really hated my life for the past 5 or so months. I don't really even know why. Almost everyday I would wake up feeling somewhat worthless, like I wasn't achieving anything and I'd just watch myself waste the day. I would auto-pilot to uni or work, and act like nothing was wrong, just so I wouldn't get asked about it - it was always the robotic, ""Yeah, not too bad; you?"" response to the standard greeting. To all my friends, I was always super happy and always joking around as usual, but when I was by myself or with my family, most of the time I was thinking about how I didn't want to be doing what I was doing. I tried to drown out the shitty thoughts with music or something, and it would work for a little while, but ""a little while"" only lasts for a little while.


This affected my academic life greatly. I had no motivation to study and all I could think about was being somewhere else where no one could contact me and I could be peaceful for just a day or two. I contemplated breaking my phone just so I would have an excuse for not being contactable, but it's got all my music on it and I'm paying $60/month for it, so screw that. Anyway, back to the academics. I sat through the first few lectures for all my subjects all ready to learn and do well this semester, as we all do. Then came more crappy thoughts. What am I doing here? This is university, and I'm supposed to be liking these subjects. Hell, I even transferred to a different degree because I felt it would be more interesting. A few weeks into semester, and I was only attending the classes where my name was marked off for attendance (and it contributed to my grade). When I came home after uni, I would go to my room and just sit there on my laptop, pretending to do work. My parents or my sibling would come in every now and then and ask me to do something I didn't care about at the time. All I wanted to do was to be mindlessly lost in something just so I wouldn't have to think about anything or anyone. I just wanted a break from it all, until I realised it would just be a break, and that work would pile up even more if I did.


""Dude, you should get a girlfriend,"" said a few of my friends. I wasn't shy around girls and I could talk to them comfortably, but my response would always be, ""Man, I'm doing an engineering degree!"" We would laugh it off, but deep in my thoughts I was thinking about how I didn't want to introduce another person into this mundane life I seem to lead - it would only make me use up more time I didn't have. I would look at all the people wearing suits or work attire on the bus and train to and from uni. I thought to myself, ""You had to do a fair bit of work to get to where you are now, but was it worth it? You had sleepless nights, and you made sacrifices to get here, but the look on your face dreads that you are going home for a few hours, only to wake up tomorrow and do it all again."" Where is this ""rewarding life"" as a result of hard academic work my family so religiously promotes? I'll work hard at uni, sacrificing all my time with my friends, just to get good grades, all for what? Just so I can finish uni and get a job and be like the sardines on the train home? I'll do this for another 40-50 years, so I can retire with a pile of money that I'll be too old to enjoy? All the time, my family says, ""Work hard now, and you'll enjoy the rest of your life, but enjoy life now, and you'll have to work hard the rest of your life."" This seems like complete bullshit to me. If I land a well-paid job, I'm going to have to put in a shitload of hours and/or work to justify the salary. That doesn't seem like I'll be ""enjoying the rest of my life.""


As a result of what seemed like depression, I started to gain weight, and I didn't really care. This year alone, I gained 19kg (around 40lbs). The more weight I gained, the less I cared about things. Assignment due soon? Screw it, I'll do it the night before it's due. Test worth 5%? Meh, it's only 5%. I wasn't doing well with my assessments, but occasionally I'd do well - that would be the easy stuff. Then finals came around. I knew I would do bad in them, but then again, where was the motivation to do well? I crammed a few nights before the exams. I knew I did really bad in the exams, but I would always respond, ""Yeah, it was alright,"" whenever I was asked how I went. I had four subjects this semester, and I'm pretty sure I failed three of them. I've failed before (but only one out of 4 subjects for a semester) so it's not like this is the first time I've failed. This time, I'm sure I passed ONE out of FOUR subjects for this semester. How the hell am I supposed to break the news that I failed three out of four subjects to a family expecting super high marks? Results will be coming out in less than a month, and I don't know how to say, ""I failed pretty much everything."" I know there's the whole ""Academics isn't everything"" argument, but they're so freakin' narrow-minded. The whole, ""If you're not a doctor, lawyer, or engineer, or [insert ridiculously high-income profession] you'll suffer in life,"" bullshit. Problem there is, I don't even know what I want to do. I thought it was engineering, but I don't find it rewarding at all. 



I've started dealing with the weight problem, though. I've been eating healthy, and exercising. I've lost almost 9 kg (20 lbs), so I'm happy about that,  but the day my uni results come out are sooner rather than later. I have no idea what to do.


Until then, I'll just hide behind my happy face. Thanks for reading.


TL;DR: Family expects good results in uni. I'm sure I failed 3 out of 4 subjects this semester. I feel depressed and I don't know how I'll be telling my ""academics is everything"" family about my shitty results. I know there's more to life than academics, but that's not the what the situation at hand is about.

And I started to notice more and more people who make less than I do living on their own. 

I was browsing entry level jobs tonight in the area where I got my degree. The scary thing is, some of them actually pay less than what I make now! Why did I get that degree and owe all that student loan money again? Very depressing. My question is: Is it realistic to live on  my own on about $28,000 a year ($13.92 an hour), or am I kidding myself by thinking this is possible? I really want this to happen. If I'm still living at home when I'm 40, I might just self-destruct.

Should I make contact with him again?,20,5,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/j8al2/i_havent_spoken_a_word_to_my_father_in_16_years/,"My father is an asshole, and has been for pretty much his whole life. This is not a subjective whine from a petulant child, but an objective comment from everyone I have ever known who has had the misfortune of crossing paths with him.

Brief backstory points:

* My parents met and married in 1967, and my father quickly revealed himself to be abusive. First it was emotional, then physical.  I was born a few years later and he did not abate his beatings on my mother. It continued until he left for good when I was 12. 
* My father frequently cheated on my mother, a fact that he proudly regaled to me when I was in my 20s. He thought it was hilarious, telling a bar full of buddies while I was there.
* In order to get a divorce, my father had a document drawn up that had my mother agreeing to zero child support and zero spousal support once the divorce was final.  She had not worked in 14 years, so that she could raise the 3 children they had (he went on to have 2 more with other women).  He presented the paperwork to my mother and threatened to beat her senseless unless she signed it. He screamed at her and she cried for hours.  Neither one of them knew I was home and could hear them clearly.
* My father would drop into our lives from time to time over the years an expect to be honored as the returning king.  He would terrorize my mother and get furious with anyone that didn't do exactly as he said, even after years away.
* Despite all of this, I believed there was a good man in there, and went to work for his consulting company when I was in my 20s. He was an evil ogre that took his frustrations out on his new wife, screaming at her, throwing things, acting like a spoiled child. On my very first day at his house after not seeing him for 8 years, he ripped into his new wife enough to make her cry and take off in her car.  He laughed as she drove off, calling her a ""dumb cunt""
* It took only a couple of days working for my father for him to fly off the handle with me, calling me an ""incompetent cocksucker"" (he called me that a lot). I didn't last very long in that job.
* When I had finally had enough, I told him I simply couldn't work in the toxic atmosphere that he thrives in. He jumped up from behind his desk and slammed his fist into my face, shattering one of my molars. I ran like a scared animal out of the office, stunned that he belted me.
* I left the next day and he sent me a letter, stating that he intended to sue me for breach of contract (we had no contract at all - not even a handshake deal - I just decided to help him with some contract work). I simply responded that I would file a report with the police for assault.  That was the last time I ever spoke with him.
* I am the oldest of all his children and have more experiences and was able to understand many of his actions when my siblings were too young to know what was going on. Some of them have a closer relationship to him than I do.

These are only a tiny selection of things off the top of my head.  Believe me, there are so many others, I could write a book. My mother should have left him, but she didn't as she comes from a family that doesn't believe in divorce. Nothing can be done about that now.

**So, to the news of the day...**

I found out from a sibling that my father was admitted to his local hospital (across the country from me) and he was given a diagnosis of stage 4 colon cancer. He's not expected to survive very long.

**He has requested that I call him. Should I?**

Homeschooled since 5th grade due to severe anxiety and then-undiagnosed dyscalculia.

That, I think, was my first mistake. Very few states recognize homeschool diplomas as legitimate without going through an outside program, which I did not do. Or any home AP courses. Essentially, I have a blank academic record. This, of course, does not indicate any lack of intellectualism, as I have been keeping myself on a autodidactic rigor for quite a while, despite my dyscalculia, leading into my second point...

The dyscalculia is my second ""mistake"". Obviously I did not have a choice in it, but it's something that has such an impact on my life, it's almost as if I did. The most I can do is simple addition and subtraction. Multiplication is where it gets difficult, and algebra is downright impossible. That's the reason why my SAT math score is 340, even after studying. I just cannot do it.

Unfortunately, there isn't a tremendous amount of awareness for this specific disability. Most colleges do not make exceptions on admissions, and typical academic accommodations are extra test time. I can't seem to get much understanding, even when I make it a subject in an admissions essay, segueing into point three...

This spring, I was rejected from both my dream college and the only college I applied to. On the first read it seems ridiculous. But when you consider that this dream college was one of the few that allowed an absence of an accredited high school diploma and did not place emphasis on SAT scores, it does being to make a certain amount of sense. Alas, it was for that reason (among some others) that it had a ~30% admit rate. I heard from friends that much more qualified applicants that I also failed. It's a small consolation.

Now here's where the real issues being. I'm going into the fall 2011 semester with nothing lined up. I'm considering a photographic expedition to, say, the Falklands (dream locale), which I can only assume is essay gold. But, that's not exactly a solution. (I might add that money is not an issue for me as my grandfather set aside education finances for me)

What I'm asking you, Reddit, is what should I do? Where should I go? I'm not really sure what I should do with my life, and sitting here at home won't help me. But I don't want to piss away my college fund on nothing and live as nothing but a 'dropout'.

This is my first throwaway. I'm going through some tough times and need a boost. It's really unlike me to vent to anyone, but this is the worst I think I've ever felt.

In 2008 I joined the military and was stationed in California where I now live. I quickly made a few very close friends here, and they've been like my family ever since. Last year, we were placed under an investigation by the military which resulted in several court martials and discharges for light drug-related offenses (has anyone heard of spice?). That's in the past, it was a pretty big mistake that I regret, but I refuse to dwell on it. I'm trying to get back on my feet now that I'm a civilian.

The last year has been the hardest in my life. My friends and I have all lost our careers, been outcast from the society that was basically our family away from home, and been sentenced to jail time (3 months for two of my friends, I was only in for 2 weeks). I had to perform military hard labor for 3 months straight, 7 days a week/12 hours a day. Now, after much hardship and grief we are all civilians. We've decided to try and make it out here on our own, but we have no benefits left over from the military, no GI bill, nothing. We all have general discharges under honorable conditions (so thankfully our reputations aren't totally destroyed). We've been searching for jobs, which is ridiculously difficult. I have 3 years military experience, but I can't even get a job at a gas station! I've been living off the last check from the military, but now I have less than 300$ left. When the 1st comes up, rent is due. Car payment. Car insurance, a couple of traffic tickets I've been unable to pay, a storage unit that we used to move but which now is overdue. I'm broke, can't get a job, no money is coming in.... and I don't know what to do. 

That's not even the whole story. That's the very central core. My brother also just lost his job and spent a few days in jail for some low stuff. He's hopeless and looking to me for advice and optimism but I don't even have any. My roommate's motorcycle died this morning, unexpectedly, and he doesn't have the money to repair it (this is his transportation to work). In the middle of all of that, I'm going through a kind of spiritual existential crisis here and I don't even know if I want to re-integrate into this society. 

I just feel bitter, I feel like only bad things happen to good people and I feel powerless in the face of this life. If anyone wants to ask any questions or clarification please do, there's so much I'm dealing with I know I've gotta be horrible at writing it out. Any advice or support is appreciated.

Basically my parents have always given me every leg up they could, but I manage to screw up my life at every turn. I know I used to be a happy kid but ever since junior/high school I've found it harder and harder to feel anything but sorrow and then resentment for those that have happiness. My problems aren't even that bad when compared to people who are really in need but I can't help but dwell on all the mistakes I've made and wallow in self-pity and self-criticism.
Fast-forward to today, my (ex) girlfriend and I had been on break for a couple weeks but I can't take it anymore and drive up to see her. On the way I total my car because I get road rage every time I drive in traffic. I don't know why I hoped she would give me another chance, but she didn't and I drive 3 hours back home in tears in a broken car. She basically hates me for making her life miserable; she says shes so much happier than every time she talks to me or I text her and I believe her...
I don't know if I'm depressed, angry, or just a normal guy who makes shitty decisions and can't get over them. I've tried every psychology trick in the book to fix my sad mindset but nothing works. I spend most days wallowing in my little one room apartment, and occasionally getting drunk and laughing at cartoons because it feels good to laugh. Every night I dream I hurt the ones I love, every morning I have a fleeting moment of happiness when I realize it was just a dream, but then I remember the reality of my life. The sad thing is my life is basically a self-fulfilling prophecy: I'm sad about something pointless. I'm distracted and unmotivated because I'm sad. My apathy ruins my life and gives me real reasons to be sad.
I'm 21, flunking out of a very good school, friendless, jobless, and as of today in love with someone who doesn't want me because my sadness leeches over to her. I sent a really long email to my parents because they're basically my last friends. I asked them to help me pay for counseling/therapy/anything so I'm trying to get help, but it would really mean a lot to see responses on reddit and pretend like I actually have someone to talk to...

However, it also means whatever activity that goes on in this area goes usually unnoticed. As a result, within the last few months, we have had all our communal lawn tables and chairs smashed, attempted break-ins into our office (some of the other offices weren't as lucky and got their laptop stolen), and most recently destroyed the wooden pagoda provided by the management and smashed all our potted plants.

When we called the management to let them know about the most recent incident, they refuse to provide this area with any security cameras or additional security guards. They said that they would have to charge us for more rent and that we wouldn't want that anyways...

So the question is this, are there some sort of ""business""-renters' protection law I can refer to? Do we just ""suck it up"" and hope that nothing worse happens? Our biggest fear is that some of the female employees might end up working late, and run into these fellas who have been committing these acts.

TL;DR Our office complex property has been vandalized and destroyed, and have experienced break-in attempts; but the property management refuses to do anything about it.

But when I'm with people I've just met or barely know, I suck. I start talking about generic things, and I know I'm incredibly boring to talk to, because I hate every second of it.

The main thing is that I have this fear of bringing up a touchy subject with the person. For example, I'm college-age, and if I meet someone, I might ask where they go to school. But I have this fear that they'd say something like ""I actually can't afford it"" or ""I had to drop out"" and then things would be awkward because we're on a downer of a subject.

I think this fear is compounded because I like to poke fun at people. I have a sarcastic sense of humor, and it's one of the ways I joke around with my friends. I kind of know where to draw the line with my friends, but with people I don't know, I could come off as an asshole if I joke about the wrong thing.

However, 2 weeks left, and I am almost positive there is no way I can do it. Missed assignments, etc. I find myself lacking any hobbies or passion for exploring like a kid again. Going cold turkey with games might provide some relief because now I have hours of more time in my day to do something productive. This is the troubling part. How does one get motivated and passion for something they deeply care about? I cannot even answer myself what I really care about? I sometimes feel myself lack the emotion about having trouble in school, abandoning my friends, and doing productive things in my life. How to overcome the laziness, the lack of motivation, and find new spark in life? I want to feel like a kid again when finding something interesting, and make it part of who I am. I am sure there are lots of people like me. Care to share your story and hep each other out? At this point, I am looking for anything to jump start me. :)

EDIT: So I sought out counseling and determined that I have severe anxiety issues that have prevented me from going on with my daily tasks. That in addition to addiction to gaming prevented me from going to class and made me miss assignments. A clinical Psychologist helped me a lot and given permission from the university, I might get extra time to finish my missed assignments for the courses this semester. I really want to succeed and overcome my troubles. The past few days without games were very hard because my entire body is constantly tense from not being able to play games.

anyways I tend to have a lot of anxiety talking to people. I overthink things and dont have problems communicating but I feel really stressed in general and cannot easily relax. the only thing that helps that is drinking so when i sit somewhere my mind isnt racing a million miles an hour.

I also absolutely hate silence and the sort of feelings at the end of a conversation if I feel I left a bad taste in peoples mouth or vice versa. I suppose maybe its a lack of self confidence but somehow I make up for it by overexaggerating confidence in other situations people seem to shy away from.

I would say I drink to have confidence, but its not really that. I drink to remove this racing thought in my mind when talking to people trying to keep the conversation going well and overanalyzing words and what people say.

The problem is that I am at a point where my managers want me to have more face time with clients, do more presentations, lead meetings etc and that is close to my worst nightmare, largely because of how horrible I am at speaking.

For the first time in my adult life, I am truly faced with a situation that I don’t know what to do.

Before the recession, I had a successful financial advisory business. Successful in this regard means 5-10 k a month. We handled retirees financial and insurance accounts. This is all I had ever done in my adult life. I loved my business, and was happy.

My business partner, unbeknownst to me, began engaging in illegal trading, with OUR clients money. TL; DR I lost my licences, lost my business. My family has been struggling ever since. That’s a long story by itself, but all you need to know is that it financially and professionally broke me.

My family of four is doing ok. Yes, we eat a few frozen meals, and the work I do doesn’t pay nearly what it did, but the fam is fine.

The family dog is NOT.

Our pup is 5 years old, and had horrible hip dysplasia. If I were to attempt to fix him, it would cost nearly $10,000.00. This is what we were told when I had money- we had some of the initial operations done, already. There is no good credit, no loans, not  a means for us to fix him. We have looked. There have been some organizations, such as [The Killuminati](http://thekilluminatifoundation.org)who cannot help, because he does not have something like Cancer. Regardless of what he has...

He HURTS.
He hurts every day.

My dog loves life. He ambles after squirrels, whining because of the pain. He loves going on walks, even though he cries the whole time. This is an animal who once barked us awake during a house fire, who so loves fun and life that he does things that cause him anguish- just because he loves being a dog.

It kills us to watch.

My 15 year old daughter wants to create a website. She thinks that if she tells his story, photographs him, takes videos of him trying to run, that she can find a Vet who will help us.
She is very optimistic, and adores the animal.

I am pessimistic, and adore the animal. I have been wondering about putting him down; wondering if loving him doesn’t mean ending his pain.

If I do that, I don’t know whether my kids can forgive me. I don’t know if it’s giving up, if it’s teaching them to quit.

Reddit, should I let my daughter make the site? Am I getting her hopes up, and causing this heroic animal more pain?? Should I just tell them that we have to end his suffering??

I see both of them just about every weekday and there's something each of those days that the dad has to raise a fuss about. It's not like he lets go easy either; he just keeps on rubbing it in with a clear and condescending tone until the kid begins to weep (even crying gets ridiculed by the dad). Things like missing a question on homework and not eating vegetables to tattle-tales from siblings and not using scratch paper liberally (seriously) are matters that warrant an ear-full. As far as I know, praise or encouragement from his dad is very rare (I don't even remember the last time the kid even got so much as a compliment from his dad). Even at the dinner table, the dad won't hesitate to spoil the mood and put the spotlight on his kid in front of everyone over something petty.

A thing to note is that this nephew has a little sister that gets along just fine with the dad and does not get any of this crap as far as I know. Such a difference in treatment could possibly worsen the effects of the scolding.

I am a full-time college student boarding at my grandma's place and I see this family almost every weekday. I feel bad for the kid and have an urge to step in.

I will also avoid giving anyone the idea that I am trying to undermine the role of his dad.

My sister is sixteen years old with stunted maturity, and I don't know how to say this but complete social ineptitude. I share these disabilities but to a lesser extent. More on that later. Point is, I have very good reason to believe these are caused by her upbringing. Namely, our parents. 

My sister, Anna (not her real name) has no friends outside of 'one girl [she] gets along with at school' and I've observed her in social situations and, well, I see why. She's afraid to speak her mind about anything and only talks to be overly critical of others' actions or appearance. She's not cruel about it, almost as if she's making conversation. She laughs if she thinks they're supposed to be funny (apparently, she's decided pretty much everything falls under this category) and it is a horrifyingly fake laugh. 

Anna is sixteen years old. My parents refuse to teach her to drive ('she's not ready' and 'she can't handle it' are the most common excuses despite the fact there's no way of knowing this since she's never been behind the wheel) and refuse to drive her anywhere. She's not allowed to walk even a block away (they live in a pretty decent neighborhood so there's no justification) and they claim she couldn't handle a job. 

Both of my parents are overly critical of their kids, but not in the usual, reasonable way. They criticize the way she stands, those little gestures people do when they're not paying attention to themselves (like drumming your fingers or plucking at a stray thread) but completely ignore the important. If she gets bad grades, they blame her ADD medication (she's been on it since she was thirteen, which I'm sure isn't helping) or the ADD itself. If she gets good grades, they brag about their good parenting. They yell at her for doing little things such as asking somebody what they're reading (even if she's asking me) or putting hot sauce on her food. They aren't against these things; they just decide she shouldn't do them. At times, they are even insulting. There was one moment my father pointed to a kid actor on TV and told Anna 'see that boy? He's half your age and works hard at his job. He's much smarter than you could hope to be.'  

Anna is smart. In the rare moments I've caught her off her guard she displays an astonishing amount of intelligence. She's got a dry sense of humor and is a gifted sculptor. 

As for me . . . like I said I experience these *issues* as well as depression and insomnia and in the past, thoughts of suicide. I seem to have it all to a lesser degree, though, which is due to numerous variables. 

When my parents started out, they seemed attentive not just to little!me but I've had family members mention the change. A few years after my sister was born, this attentiveness dropped off. They grew lazy, nagging, and argumentative. 

I also had a good deal of cousins near my age and they would go to bat for me if need be. Anna, sadly, has no cousins within seven years of her age. I also, and this is going to sound kind of sad, but got very heavily into online communities which helped with my social skills. That, and I've held a job pretty solidly since I was fifteen. Anna almost seems like she has stockholm syndrome. Somethings wrong, clearly but because that life is all she knows, she'll do anything to keep her life as stress-free as possible. To do that, she convinces herself she agrees with whatever my parents say even if she told me in confidence she feels opposite. My parents don't argue with logic. They pull lies out of their ass and try to argue you down to wear your'e just worn out and go along. I, inheriting my family's inability to drop anything, never did this. I fought tooth and nail. Anna does not have the internet, the will to argue, and isn't allowed a job. 

I left as soon as I turned eighteen and talk to them maybe twice a month at most. I've tried to talk to my sister but as you can tell, the entire thing is difficult to explain. I don't even know what she should DO to get out of that situation or how I can help her. She knows it's a problem so pointing that out gets us nowhere. 

If I lived in a house I'd let her move in with me. If I had money I'd get her driver's ed classes. If I could drive (they refused to teach me and I just learned the bus system very well) I'd teach her to do the same. 

I just . . . I don't know what to do.

My dad and mom got a divorce and my dad remarried this woman. This woman had 2 kids, girls, who we've gone to school with for years. We moved into their house. I have 3 sisters, they are 14, 13, and 12 right now and I'm 19.

To put it in a nutshell that house is Hell.

The woman my dad married is an alcoholic, who also turned my dad into an alcoholic. We constantly had to fake our lives and our happiness. We were basically locked up and not allowed to do anything a normal kid in middle/high school would be able to do. We were constantly threatened to get very important things taken away from us. (ex. I was not allowed to attend my audition which caused me a great resume, scholarships, and eventually my major in college.)

We were constantly in fear because of this absolute evil aura this woman gave off. The littlest thing can make her just burst into screaming and yelling that would scare the shit out of us. Also, there was some other physical abuse, they were careful when they did this though so we couldnt call the cops on them. We were constantly threatened to be sent to Juvie even thought we did nothing wrong. (She did already do this to her other daughter, and she was sent to juvie.) Also one thing that I could not stand there is the house is infested with lice, yes LICE, those little blood sucking bugs that live in your hair.

I hated my life there and left when I turned 18.(her daughter also left at 18) My sisters are still there and I cant stand that they are there suffering. I dont talk to them much but I know there is still abuse there and that they are not happy. Social Services has been called twice before but the parents are just really good at faking the ""happy family"" and my little sisters are too afraid to every say anything.

I am in college right now, living on financial aid and the income of 2 part time jobs. But there has to be something I could possibly do. Please if you know anything that could help me it would be greatly appreciated. I really want them out of there. Thanks

Help?,20,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1k6wi0/my_dad_is_talking_to_a_woman_from_his_work_with_a/,"I'm asking for actual advice here, I'm clueless in this situation. And sorry if this bends the rules a bit, but this isn't relationship centralized. Sorry.

A while ago (maybe earlier a few months ago) I saw my dad texting a woman Diane (from his work) and it was a flirt conversation. The way old people flirt, like about hugging and caressing. I just saw it because it was in his cupholder, and I was out with him for errands. I asked him about it and I told him she had a husband and he got really mad and told me to get out of his business and yelled and screamed at me about how I didn't know anything about it. He does this often.

So, I just said Ok and left it alone, because I was tired of being bitched at. But now, I got home and I saw he had another text from her (it popped up as I was making some noodles) and it was talking about the mentioned above, creepy old person flirting regarding her feet. I'm 95% certain she has a husband, because my father mentioned her husband and he said he was friends with them and would 'never do that.' Regardless, it's still happening.

Should I bring this up to him? Should I ignore him and tell someone from his work? What am I supposed to do?

Background: My parents divorced when I was about 2 and I lived with my Mom and Step-Dad (both drug addicts) and my step-sister. Eventually they had 2 kids together (totaling 3 girls, 1 boy). He knew my Mom was on drugs but always thought a daughter should be raised by her mother (Background on my Dad, dropped out of school in 7th grade, not very educated). My Dad had me on weekends and two nights a week for dance. I never had anyone at my Mom's house watching me.
My Mom and Step-Dad were so lost in drugs. Both my Mom and Step-Dad physically abused me and my step-sister and other brother and sister when they got older. My Dad was constantly calling Child Protective Services because of new bruises on my face, arms, back, legs, and butt. He realized he needed to do something more drastic and wanted to get full custody of me.

Story I need advice with:
My step-sister and I made friends with a girl next door (call her A) who was about 4-5 years older than us (we were in kindergarten/1st grade and she was in 5th grade). My step-sister and I always wanted A to think we were cool so we would do whatever she wanted to do. We were all just playing barbies one day and she started to rub the ken and barbie doll together. She told us they were having sex and that her and her friends like to get naked and rub their bodies together. 
She told us that they would build forts and hang blankets from the ceiling so their parents wouldn't know because they weren't supposed to rub bodies but they liked it. She asked us if we wanted to try it. I'm not sure if curiosity was the reason that we did or if we were seduced because we were so young but I find the whole situation very creepy now. We called them ""sex games"" and every time we had sleep overs she wanted to play ""sex games"" with us. Sometimes she would lay between us switch back and forth pretending she was cheating on one or the other. The ""sex games"" eventually led me to start touching myself. I noticed if when I had to pee and I rubbed myself, it would feel even better. So I started trying to ""make myself not want to pee"" by rubbing my knuckles on my clit. I didn't know this was considered master bating but learned as I got older. 

One day I was ""making myself not want to pee"" laying on the couch in the living room. I was trying to hide from my Mom's friend that I was doing this but she noticed. I tried to pretend I was tickling myself on the inside of my leg like my Dad did to me. She asked me who touches me there and I said my Dad. Not because he touched me *there* but that he tickles me on my leg. She thought I meant my Dad was molesting me. I can still see the pain in her eyes and feel that I said something wrong today. I watch it replay in my mind almost every day. Watching her get up off the couch and run to the other room to tell my Mom what I just said. 

The next few months were very hard. My Dad lost custody of me and wasn't allowed to see me for over a year. They gave me a ""vaginal check"" of sorts and proved that I was being touched. I was too scared to tell them it stemmed from my neighbor teaching us ""sex games"" and then from me touching myself. He hired a lawyer and was found innocent eventually. My Mom was found to be ""unfit"" and my Dad was granted full custody of me. I've lived with my Dad ever since (my step-sister lived with her grandmother and my brother and sister stayed with my Mom, living between a van and shelters in bad areas). If my Dad hadn't been granted custody of me I think I would be a completely different person. I feel like I owe my life to him and am so grateful that he was able to take me out of the situation I was in.

I guess what I'm asking advice on is, how/should I tell my Dad about this? I feel incredibly guilty about the whole situation. I think about it daily. I have talked to a counselor about this which is why I am able to see what happened a little clearer now. I'm just so torn. I wouldn't even know where to start.

It was gradual at first, but it slowly and surely became more extreme and exaggerated.  He first started hating on anime, then Nintendo, then even Japanese cars like Toyota.  Over the years, we have tried to convince him with various arguments, but to no avail.


Now, his hatred is so exaggerated it's almost satirical.  One time we were talking about what we would do if we could have one wish.  He said, ""Kill all the Japs off the face of the earth, and yeah, even Japanese-Americans.""


Last time, one of my other friends tried to convince him, the two got into a huge argument.  This guy remained steadfast even in the face of superior logic and reasoning.  He was very stubborn in general.  He also holds grudges for a long time.  He brings up times when I wronged him in Jr. High and hates one of his former friends with a passion (for a really trivial reason).



Recently, he has started to say stuff like, ""You know, Hitler was pretty cool.  They helped out China during WWII, gave them tanks and training"" and has started to become racist against Jews and ""white people"" in general.  It's like he's conditioning himself to be racist.

I had some spotting on maybe Wednesday. Now, it's Sunday, the day I should be having my period. While I haven't taken a placebo pill just yet (I take the pills at 10 PM, and it's still 5 PM), I've only been having brownish reddish spotting... when I usually have a ""regular"" flow.

****Deep breath****

I'm in my late 20's i'm unemployed and I've never had a job in my life!

****Phew..... Ok.... Time to continue.....****

It all started when I was about 12-13 getting bullied in school and long story short I had stopped going by the time I was about 14 due to how bad it was

I was going on and off and to many different schools and even stayed at one for a month or two at one point but all in all I missed the last year and a half (ish) of school and thus don't have a single qualification!!! NOTHING!!! :'(

Fast forward a few years and i'm getting dangerously close to being 30 still living at home, unemployed and uneducated and at a loss with my self

To make matters worse I've always felt i might be SLIGHTLY autistic as I had learning difficulties in school (another factor to stopping going..) and also have unbelievably bad social skills and have near crippling anxiety (making interaction with another person a HUGE no no)

My problem is i'm stuck in a rut tbh as I can't get a job as any social interaction isn't possible or at least is something I'd want to avoid at all costs and even so I'd never get a job being an almost 30 years old with no education and an empty CV and even if I did i'm literally an employers worst nightmare and wouldn't be able to keep a job with my social skills/problems

I'd REALLY like a job even something really menial would be fine as it'd bring in some much needed cash (Always LOVED the idea of working from home that'd be a dream!)

My mom married my step dad when I was in 9th grade so we moved in with him to this small town in Texas.
Through out my high school he put many rules on me.
He began by not letting me go to a different church on wednesdays other than the ""family"" church (where I knew no one, but apparently church wasn't for friends, it was for ""the message""), only letting me use my cell phone 4 hours a day from the end of school to 7.
Somehow I got rid of these rules by the end of 9th grade, but didn't realize he was just getting started.
Sophomore year he began ""evaluating"" my progress. He bought a white board, hung it up in the restroom and made what I call the 10 commandments, which include things like, be involved in family activities (him and my mom), pet the dogs, read quality books, etc. He graded me on these for quite a while. I ignored it.
Junior year I asked to go to NY with my theater arts class. I knew it was a big question, but I made good grades in school and never miss behaved. He made me read the gospel books of the bible in order to go, which I did and was there fore able to go. Even though I disliked reading the bible, this seemed like an okay idea for such a big petition, but this only started what would come my senior year..
The summer before senior year I did all I could to begin driving, went to those driving classes, got my insurance, which I had and still have to pay, etc. The car though, was not given to me because of a condition. 1. I would have to read books CONSTANTLY in order to be able to ""pay"" them for the used car they already had for me, and if I didn't they would take it up. (These books were of their choice, including business topics, and religious ones, like the bible) 2. The white board we had in the restroom with the ""10 commandments"", would have to have an average of 8 in order for me to do anything fun with the car like going out with friends etc. If I failed, the car would be taken up.
I followed those rules all through senior year, unitl these last months. Im getting tired of them. I want to leave.. :(

I just realized how much more I still have to mention about him for anyone to know the whole thing so Ill stop here.

Right now, I'm graduated and want to move out and get rid of all these rules. I want to get an apartment with my cousin in this bigger city, go to this cheap community college that is really nice and do my basics, and work somewhere close and have support (and money) of my aunt (her mom) and my biological dad, who lives in Mexico, but sends me money.
Obviously, when my parents heard this they freaked and tried to convince me to live here, go to this community college which is really ghetto, work at the cafe they own (I mentioned I liked in a small texas town? the customers are very rude, old, typical cowboy texans. The employees hate me and I hate them).. 
They say I don't have a choice, because I don't have money, but I really don't wanna live here. :(

Did I mention all of my other family like aunts and uncles are in a huge fight with my immediate family over issues with my stepdad being so close minded? And that him and his own family are also in a fight of that kind? 
We have no where to go for christmas, 4th of July, etc.

I have a stable job (for this economic climate) with income that certainly isn't top notch, but for a college dropout like me, it's pretty fine, and when I amount the number of hours I work in a week (30-35 average) it's great. Five days a week. From that perspective, all is grand.

But, since I live with my girlfriend, the money gets low pretty easy...she works but when we pay the rent, utilities and commute (we drive an old car too) we can exactly save a whole lot.

The problem is, many of my friends have far better situations. Wealthier parents, living in their own apartments instead of renting one like we do etc. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying it's kinda harder to pull all this weight without any significant financial backup/background.

That being said I'm kinda lost on what I want to do with my life. So here is my state of mind:

I think my main problem is not being appreciative of my skills. I have a solid knowledge in IT and I'm currently working in marketing, doing things from direct marketing management to directing video and web projects.

The problem is whenever I finish a project, I feel almost ""ashamed"" of it. I see all the little imperfections and I don't have the slightest habit of ""showing off"" my work to my friends or acquaintances.

I've met a lot of people who had ""mediocre"" skills but they marketed the hell out of them, they talked about themselves as if they were NASA engineers and people bought into their story and respected them for their work.

I don't know if I try to hide my procrastination habit or some subliminal self-esteem issue, but I only see the bad things in my work. 

The problem occurred to me last month. I've helped my good friends patent project for 2 months, he came up with a cool invention and I've made design interface for iPhone app that will control his invention...and I've did the logo design for his product, packaging, and web.

I haven't yet received the money for the project yet, but I can't brush off the feeling of being...unworthy of compensation...

All I think about is how average I am and I'm aware that many people in the world could do the exact same thing I do, and better.

This affects my career choice. I wish I could do videography for life. But lately I can't even force myself to film anything, or even do photography.

A friend of mine jokingly asked me one day ""how many shots did you take on that camera of yours...and how many of those photos are on someones wall""

It really struck me...because he has a point...yet I do not want to do mundane things like wedding photography, because I feel it would drain the life out of me, I have very reserved feelings towards the whole outlandish parade show-off called ""the wedding"".

My main worry is how to change my mindset...how to make a bold move...how to appreciate my own self. I know I'm not the best. But I do want to be as best as I can. I just have hard time willing myself into this, because of all this clouds of doubt over my head.

My wife and I had just moved to a new place, and we were coming home from getting groceries.  It is around 1AM, and we're like 3 minutes from our new house.  As I'm driving, I see something off in the distance.  I thought it was a deer because we live in a semi rural area.  As we got closer, I realized it was a woman, and she looked distressed.  At this point, I'm like, ""Okay, some dumb ass redneck is out walking at one in the morning"".  Well as we got closer to her, she started to move into the road.  Now I'm like...""What the fuck?!"".  (As I'm typing this I can feel my adrenaline and heart pumping :/)  ....So I stop at this point because she is in the middle of the damn road.  My wife told me to lock the doors seconds before, but in my panic I think I may have unlocked them.  Now she is starting to literally jump on my car.  Note: I have an 05 Nissan Pathfinder so it is pretty high off the ground.  But somehow she tried...Please also keep in mind this happened within less than 5 minutes.  So now I'm honking, and I literally sling her off my car.  We drive off while calling 911....

I'm really sorry about the huge story, but I really need advice.  I think I have maybe a mild case of PTSD or something because, although I'm doing much better now, I still have some major mental issues.  After having this near death experience, I've started thinking every bad thing that happens in the world is going to happen to me.  I fear for my life and my wife's life.....and I know I shouldn't.   Now my wife is pregnant, and that gives me something else to worry about!!  I really am sorry this was so long, but any advice would be awesome!  I hope you got some humor out my pain :D

edit:  First off, some of your are kind of ass holes, and I'm not sure why you're even on this subreddit.  I don't want anyone's pity. I've been thinking I should seek the advice of a professional I just keep putting it off.  I really appreciate what most of you have said, and I think I'm going to set up an appointment at my University's counseling office.

He has been for as long as I can remember. His main addictions are pills and alcohol. The household goes through a cycle where dad hides his addictions and lies and everything is a-ok until he is found out. Then the arguing phase starts. The tension in the house escalates until my parents are arguing with each other almost every day. Then eventually my dad hits what appears to be a ""rock bottom"".  Afterwards he seems to seek help and promises that it will never happen again and he has changed for good. These promises have always turned out untrue, and the cycle continues.

In the phase of ""peace"" after a rock bottom event my mom and brother immediately forgive him, and just the next day it is as if he never did anything wrong. It's like he didn't beat down my mother right in front of me. It's like he didn't chase my younger brother in a drunken rage and try to strangle him. It's like he didn't threaten to slit my mother's throat if she turned him over to the police. These are things that happen during a rock bottom.

Not wanting to cause anymore trouble I  usually do my best to follow their lead, and act like my dad is a saint, but this time I was the one to find a message my dad sent negotiating getting pills from someone. I told my mom about it, and confided to her that I didn't know how much more I could stand of my dad. I wished she would just leave him, but she depends on his finances too much, and she says that she doesn't want to be alone. She told me that I shouldn't hold a grudge towards my dad and not to act bitter towards him because he has flaws just like everyone else and inside he is a good man. She has told me basically this same speech after every rock bottom moment also.

When does he stop deserving more chances? I am 19 and this cycle has been going on my whole life and it always ends in violence. I feel like I've run out of forgiveness for my dad, and I wish I could take my mom and brother away from him. I have a job and a second home with my boyfriend, but I don't have my own car, so I have to stay at my parents' home sometimes, and I just don't know what to do. I can't stand to be around him. It makes me so tense and angry knowing what he has done, but I work in the same building my dad does, so I partly rely on him for transportation. I honestly wish he would disappear from my life, and I feel bad for feeling this way because no one else does. Is there something wrong with me?

Basically my questions are: Am I wrong for feeling the way I do? Any advice for dealing with the way I feel about my dad? Does he deserve more chances? Should I do my best to just cut ties with him? I don't know what to do.

1365776964.0,13,self.needadvice,1c7gz9,27 yo computer scientist hating his career - Lost,18,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1c7gz9/27_yo_computer_scientist_hating_his_career_lost/,"I have had a few jobs since graduating in 2011 with a CS degree and haven't ever been able to find any happiness in my career choice.  It might be premature because I am so young, but I feel like I am in a hole that I can't get out of.  (I am also trying to rewrite this the best I can because I accidentally closed the tab...great week let me tell you).

My last job gave me $55k starting out, sat me in a corner in the back room, and never seemed to remember I was there.  I had no work typically, or work that I had no idea how to do since I was new and everyone else was too busy to try and work with me on it.  It was 90% of the work was with 10% of the people because, you guessed it, horrible management.  I now work with a couple of old friends who I have known for over a decade and, when described, sounds like the best job a programmer could ever get.

I basically get no emails or phone calls.  There are 3 of us down here, not overloaded, but will always have work as the company upstairs (my coworker's father's company) is the company we basically support, along with a few other clients.  I come in and basically am given work as the day goes by.  Sometimes I get something that takes a while to complete, sometimes there are 4 or 5 tasks that take about 5 mins each to complete.  A lot of times I sit around pondering why I hate what I do or waste time on this website and others.  The thing that made this all come down yesterday was that he asked me to get a new project started using MVC and set it up with twitter bootstrap.  I have tried to learn MVC in the past but didn't really have much success and sort of took a hit to my pride.  Well, trying again just to play around with it, I realized that I still had no idea what I was looking at or what I needed to do to get going, and I just felt no motivation to even try to learn it (probably because I have been depressed the past 2 weeks).

I thought just a couple of weeks ago this all was stemming from my girlfriend's job because she works odd hours and I don't see her very much, but not until a couple of days ago did I realize that the things that are making me unhappy and sad and angry are all because of my choices.

I get into these cycles of hating my job, trying to figure out what I would want to do, then all the reasons why I can't do them.  I feel like I need a change of scenery, but I don't have a clue what I would change to.  I feel that if I didn't do programming, got a job somewhere else, I would make a lot less money and not be able to afford it.  I feel like if I went back to school, I definitely wouldn't be able to afford it and, anyways, I don't even want to go back to school right now.  I have too much debt from the first go around and what if I paid for another degree that I wouldn't like any more than what I have.  I feel like I want to move, but I think I would just take my problems with me and not have my friends anymore.  And then because this is how I think, I don't sleep real well, if any.  I have to take Lorazepam just to try to feel normal (they are prescribed) and a lot of times they don't even seem to work.

So I am asking for some guidance since I don't know where else to turn really.  However, I do also realize that I shouldn't expect any answer from anyone else to solve my problems if I can't seem to find one myself.  I am young enough to where I should be able to have plenty of time to figure things out, but I feel like I am in a hole that I can't dig out of.  I don't want to waste away my one life in something that doesn't make me happy, and honestly am not sure if any of those things that I said I feel like I need are the answers.  But something has to give and I don't know what that is.  

I have heard that maybe reading [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Do-What-You-Are-Personality/dp/0316167266) is a good starting point.  I might go get it today.

I am sure I am not the only one that has these issues ( I have been scouring the CS subs and this sub and see it as well).  Am I just burnt out?  How could that be if I only have been doing this legitimately for just over a year?

I can't get off of it though because I hate myself and probably get something out of feeling superior to all the stupidity posted here. Please help (post is so long because I'm ranting about what a loser I am, sorry)

I've been using this website for a little over a year, and I truly hate it. The overused sayings and memes, the type of people who make up the majority of the site, the self righteousness, the repetition of it all, everything. 

Yet I swear I spend 80% of my waking hours on this website. I'm a student yet I barely go to class, don't have friends, don't have a job, don't even leave my dorm except to get food. But I don't know why I choose to live like this. I'll go to class for the first ~third of a semester and ace every test and assignment, then think fuck it I can do this in my sleep and stop going to class. Then I'll miss a test or not turn in a project or something because I didn't do something as simple as caring enough to write down a goddamn due date. Then I just give up because I know I'm *fucked* regardless of what I do because I just ruined my chances of getting good grades. I *had* friends but don't have the wherewithall to keep up friendships for more than a few weeks with anyone who I don't see as being a pretty perfect example of a human being.

I pity myself and but at the same time think I'm better than everyone and that I could own the fucking world if I just tried. (just like everyone says on Reddit. but it's different for *me*! /s) I know, I'm a lazy, hypocritical bag of shit. I say I hate Reddit yet I act like a stereotypical ""neckbeard"" and spend all my time on it. I think the real problem is that I hate myself. I really am naturally talented in many ways and can see so much potential in myself in a lot of different things but I'm too much of a piece of shit to do anything with it. I'm really not even socially awkward either, and I'm attractive to boot.

 My only friend is my girlfriend (1 year younger, lives 3 hours away + in high school) who is extremely hot and cool but I'm not sure if I really love her or if I'm just hanging on to that relationship because I don't want to be completely alone. And she visits me every 3 weeks and it's my only real human interaction plus we have tons of great sex. She doesn't know the extent of my loserness because she doesn't know how I spend my average day. In fact she is sometimes insecure that she'll lose me to some college girl which is ridiculous because I don't even have any female friends here! It's not that I've ever been rejected or have failed to make friends, I just never tried. I have plenty of dorm acquaintances who like me and I will sometimes hang out with but I never make real friendships. [Occasionally they'll say things like, 'man I never see you around anymore, you must be a busy guy!' they probably think I'm just aloof and not riddled with self hatred and anxiety sitting in my room]. It's like I don't think I'm actually a member of the human species and being normal just isn't an option for me. I just don't see the point of it all. 

I think I'm depressed or even bi-polar but who really knows I might just be a moody loser. (this post is very negative and self-hating because that's how I feel right now, but I know in a few days or a week I'll be on top of the world about myself. It always happens). I also ""have"" ADHD-I (non-hyperactive, diagnosed twice at age 18), but I'm not even sure that I believe it's a real thing. I realize that I'm a posterboy for ADD and that it explains a lot of my issues, but most of the time I think it's a bullshit ""disorder"" and more of an excuse for why I'm just being a piece of shit who needs amphetamines to get anything done. And I don't know what to do.

I was praised for being intelligent as a child, so it's possible I could just be conditioned to assume life should be easy.

My father was an alcoholic, workaholic, and gambling addict.
I find it painful to read past the 50% mark of an average sized article. Books I can get about 25% through (but usually only if it's about curing my problems. I can't even begin fiction books for the most part).

I used to watch a lot of porn, but don't anymore. I realise that addiction might have contributed to my problem. I only recently stopped, so maybe I'm still slowly recovering?

I do have a drink and drug problem too. Also a bit of a reddit addiction. I definitely seem addicted to instant gratification. Much feels unbearable. I have very low frustration/stress tolerance.

I'm suffering quite intensely. I see how much time I waste, how much I fail to achieve. I dropped out of uni with nothing to show for it other than a massive debt.

I recently tried out memory tricks to help me learn, but even that was torturous and hasn't really seemed to work.

What should I do? I've tried in the past going fully sober, tried forcing myself to read fiction despite the pain.

I love making electronic music, but again with that I rarely finish my tracks. I can work on it for an hour or so, but soon it starts to feel unbearable.

I know how much potential I have, but I just can't seem to hold on long enough to achieve anything that I can really feel all that proud of. It's interesting that the best music I've made was when I was addicted to diet coke. So yeah, perhaps I need stims. But even when I was on wellbutrin I didn't notice a huge difference. I've switched that now for pure choline &amp; inositol, which gives me a nice energy boost.

I should emphasize, I have all the symptoms of BPD, PTSD, ADHD, GAD, and Social Anxiety Disorder.

So yeah, what is it? I don't really want to take stims, my PTSD seems so complex that it seems incurable (perhaps I'm slowly recovering?)

However, recently, I've begun to suspect that one of my roommates is cheating. He has been opting to write his answers in an Excel spreadsheet, in the interest of saving paper. As such, he is very confrontational about letting others see his screen. I believe this is actually because he is looking up the answers in the [Jeopardy archive](http://j-archive.com/) as he plays.

When he keeps track of his score on a computer, it is not uncommon for him to score in excess of $50 000, whereas in other games it is rare for him to reach $20 000. He also provides correct answers to almost all questions, some of which it is hard to believe he would know the answer to and often mispronouncing key words.

Or she might have snuck out the door when we went in or out (but I think that is unlikely.)

The cat is old, she could just be dead in the house somewhere and we haven't found her yet.

But if she got out, the problem is, I live in a city that requires a pet license. And we've just been too busy since moving here to get one. (I KNOW shoot me I feel HORRIBLE) So if I go to the pound, and she's there, I'm looking at 25 dollar licensing fee, a 50 dollar impound fee, a 15 dollar per day boarding fee, a fine for not having a collar, and a fine of 100-2,000 dollars for having an unlicensed pet, and probably additional fines and fees not specified on the website (the city website said as much).

No way can our family afford that, any of it. We are flat broke until June when we get a few bills paid off. So I don't really want to call. On the other hand, I don't want to not call either because if they DO have her I don't want them to put her to sleep. 

I am absolutely gutted, I don't know what to do. My wife says, if the cat can't find its way home, that's its own fault. But it's her cat! And I feel guilty! Yet she's the one crying? (no I don't need relationship advice, I need advice about my cat)

(ALSO I fear my city will be a dick about the whole thing, and ask for my license, and if my cat is not there, fine me for not having a pet license anyway.)

It was extremely painful and shocking for the other child. I tried to handle the situation like I always do and calmly talk it out but he had a total meltdown. He threw himself on the bed and shouted over and over that he wanted to kill himself. He was obviously ashamed with his behavior but truly felt the only solution was to kill himself. He kept begging me to bring him a knife. His mom came home shortly after and took over. He isn't my son and I don't have any say in what happens as far as seeking help, but I want to keep a dialogue open about his feelings.

He's showing early signs of Bipolar Disorder and has given up on soccer (which he used to love) and hates school. The only thing he really cares about is his weekly Magic game with the very few friends he has.

Today I was talking to my mom and she was concerned about how much money he was spending on his deck. I suggested she encourage him to take up D&amp;D with his friends because I think he'd enjoy it. She said absolutely not because he will get addicted to it and then kill himself.

My mom is normally a rational, intelligent, open-minded person and I was shocked to hear her say this. She's also incredibly stubborn and I've never known her to change her mind on anything ever. She is insistent that people kill themselves over D&amp;D, and because he has an addictive personality (he actually does,) he would be one of them.

This offends me on two levels:
1) I play D&amp;D! So does my other brother (24) and I suspect one of our sisters does too (21.) Unfortunately, I'm on the other side of the country and the other two are several hours away, so none of us could play with him. We also didn't start playing until we were out of the house, so my mom's perceptions might be skewed from lack of exposure (she thought it was a computer game at first, but stood her ground after I explained pen and paper RPGs.)
2) I have struggled with depression in the past, and have attempted suicide (I'm okay now, though. If you're reading this and you aren't, /r/SuicideWatch is a good resource.) If she thinks that people commit suicide for a ""reason,"" what reason does she think I had? Wouldn't my brother's social isolation be a worse trigger?

1361380571.0,13,self.needadvice,18w8kw,I've lost my passion for my major and my confidence in my writing. I hate my classes. How do I get through the rest of this semester? Where can I find my passion/confidence again? How do I learn to enjoy what I'm being forced to read?,20,7,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/18w8kw/ive_lost_my_passion_for_my_major_and_my/,"Throwaway. I am really struggling with school this year. I’m in my sophomore year in college on a year abroad and I’m an English major. In the country I’m in, you only take one subject your entire time in college and you only take 2 classes at a time which are equivalent to 15 US credits a semester. So I’m taking all English classes. I’ll have 30 credits in English at the end of the year. An English degree is only 36 credits at my home university, half of which need to be completed at my home university. So I’m not going to get credit for half of what I did this year.

The problem is I have been extremely stressed out about writing essays even though I got good/okay grades last term. I have 2 due next week and I can’t even figure out where to start.

*Basically I don’t like ANY of my classes. I only had 7 classes to choose from and I had to pick 4. I was forced into doing shit I have no interest in. I have absolutely NO INTEREST in ANY of the stuff I’m reading.*

I don’t understand why that is. I’m an English major, I’m supposed to love this stuff. But I don’t. I don’t read for fun anymore. A creative writing course last year with a horrible teacher made me lose my love of writing. She didn’t understand any of my writing and made me change everything so it was extremely literal. I couldn’t be imaginative in that class at all. 

*The thing is, I did extremely well in creative writing in high school so I know I’m good at it. The comments on my essays last semester all praised my writing skills. But I’m not confident in it anymore and I don’t write for fun anymore. I don’t feel surges of creativity like I used to. I dread writing essays. I put it off until the last minute.*

I hate school right now. That’s not good because I was on the Dean’s list my freshmen year. I shouldn’t hate school, I’m good at it. At least I was in America. I know I’m smart. I’m not stupid. I just don’t have any confidence and I keep stressing out about my essays.

I think the problem is I can’t think abstractly and I’m not good at bullshitting. Which is what you NEED if you’re majoring in English. It would be extremely stupid to change my major after earning 30 credits in it already. Money isn’t a huge issue though and I COULD do it if I absolutely needed to. The thing is, there is nothing else I am interested in. I don’t care about anything, I’m not passionate about anything other than learning how to do makeup and playing piano, which I've done for 13 years. And no, I’m not going to go to cosmetology school.

My whole life I thought I would be going to grad school. My dad and grandpa always tell me after I’m done with this degree, go and get the next one. In an encouraging way. That right now is putting an insane amount of pressure on me.  *I just recently told my mom in an email that I don’t think I have what it takes to go to grad school—the passion, the interest, the drive—and that I’m not sure I even want to.* 

My plans after grad school would be to become a professor and teach.  But what can I do with an undergrad in fucking English if I don’t go to grad school? I won’t be able to find a job! I can get my teaching license but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life teaching snotty bratty kids. All the hate for arts degrees on reddit is getting to me.  Everyone thinks if you’re not a STEM major your degree is worthless.  I’m sick of hearing that. And I’m not going to major in science, math, computers etc because I don’t enjoy it.  I’m also sick of hearing “those who can’t do, teach.” It makes me feel worthless.

**TL;DR: Not passionate about English anymore but I'll have 30 credits in it at the end of the year. Hate all my classes. Dread writing essays and I have 2 due next week I haven't written a word on. Keep breaking down. Unsure about grad school but my family expects me to. Don't know if I should switch majors. Not passionate about anything else other than music and makeup which won't get me anywhere.**

What I want to know is  
* How can I stop dreading my essays?  
* Where can I find my confidence again?  
* How can I learn to enjoy what I’m reading? THIS ONE'S IMPORTANT.
* Where can I find my love for reading for pleasure and writing creatively again?  
* Should I switch majors?  
* What should I say to get my family to shut up about grad school?

He eats a disproportionally large amount of the food we communally buy, and won't pay extra for it. He keeps his room messy.

It's hard to tell him we don't want him to live with him because he is a nice person and we've known him for three years.

What can I do?",17,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/14ef13/after_coming_out_of_a_deep_depression_my/,"In high school and beginning university, I excelled in mathematics. Math team award winner, 5 on AP Calculus test, 2380 on my SAT, the works. I remember always being able to easily grasp the concepts and abstractions and derive the necessary formulas from them. Got a really nice scholarship to my dream university to study engineering. 

However, halfway through my first year of college, for various hereditary, familial, social, and who knows what other reasons, I got deep, deep into a serious depression. I spent weeks on end just lying in my bed, only getting up to eat and use the bathroom. I attempted suicide twice. 

Needless to say I flunked out of school. 

However, I got help. I managed to build up enough motivation to make a counselor appointment, who referred me to a psychiatrist, who got me on therapy and antidepressants. It was a long and tough journey, but I managed to work out my issues, train my brain, and I now consider myself for the most part a  happy, well-adjusted person. 

Fast forward a year, I started at community college in an attempt to build myself back up to transfer back to my dream school. It doesn't take AP calculus, so I think ""Fine, I'll just breeze through college algebra and get right back on track."" 

I take the class, and find the algebra I took in 9th grade to be a lot more difficult than I remember. I study my ass off, go to the tutoring center, and end up failing anyway. I retake it. Fail again. 

I've since changed my major to business since it's apparent there's no way I'll get into any engineering program anywhere with my math grades. Even then, I barely made a C in accounting. My grades in non-math classes remain unchanged from high school, but it seems I've lost my grip on anything more complicated than arithmetic when it comes to numbers, when I was once crunching differential equations with ease. 

It could just be psychosomatic, a remnant of my crippling depression. It could be that the massive chemical imbalance in my head damaged my frontal lobes somehow. I could really use some advice on what to do. I don't have health insurance anymore and work a minimum-wage job so please don't just tell me to ""go see a professional"".

SO when I was back in middle school I started taking Adderall to treat my ADHD, after 5 years of taking it I was addicted to say the least.  As far as I can tell it was completely mental, I had built a mindset that I needed the medicine to be normal and was scared to death to go off my meds (if I forgot to take the pill in the morning I would shut down mentally and freak out).  Finally I was able to break the habit, my depression lessened, happiness increased 10 fold, and GPA dropped by one point.  Overall I was happy.  It has been over 5 years since I stopped taking the medicine and I am beginning to struggle in my later years of college as I try to get what I need to graduate.  I know that if I start taking the medicine I will do much better academically and my overall productivity will increase, depression will get worse [currently it's at a 8 on a 1(perfectly happy) to a 10 (suicide)] but I am scared to death that I will become addicted again.  The last thing I want is to become dependent on a medication again and see my quality of life decrease.  The big problem arises with grades, to get the jobs that I hope to get I need to keep a decent GPA at my university and to do that I really need to up my GPA somehow and most conventional skills that I have used in the past have failed.  So what do I do?  To succeed as society and family expects me to do I need to raise my grades, but if I get on a medication I fear I will become an addict and lose my mind as well as my happiness.  But if I don't get the grades I need I won't be able to get the degree that I am trying to finish and the kind of job that I want.

A little medical history: I have gotten the worst form both sides of the family, I grabbed manic/bi polar form one side and bad depression from the other.  I had transient global amnesia several years ago and am continually losing more memories than I care to admit.  I am overall mentally unstable.  Suicide is not a worry of mine, while I think of it quite often I set myself some guidelines to keep me form it that I had to follow several years ago.

TL/DR:  Addicted to ADHD meds in the past, took ages to break the addiction.  Finally broke it and life got much better but grades dropped.  Now years later compounded with memory loss and constant depression I am struggling in the last years of college with productivity.  Do I go on the meds and up my grades but increase my depression?  Or do I keep things as is and struggle to keep my GPA at an acceptable level.

At the time I was in a bad financial situation and I jumped on the opportunity. It's a ""good job"". Big company, benefits, whatever.

I've learned a lot in this job, but I plateaued about 2 years in. Now I'm in a rut. 

* I maintain the same systems I did when I started. 
* It is a bureaucracy heavy job with lots of unnecessary paperwork and little programming. 
* Management is from a different era and doesn't understand the Internet and don't value what I do. 
* The policies are draconian and prevent me from getting work done. No open source software, IE only (!!), can't use source control... and on and on. The people who set/enforce the rules don't understand them, and it's a letter-of-the-law rather than spirit-of-the-law kind of place. 
* Much of the little technical work I had to do is now being handed to offshore workers, which I am expected to hire, train and supervise.
* We are using severely outdated technology and my skills are slipping.

This makes me miserable day in and day out. I no longer do programming in my spare time because my spirit has been crushed. I think to myself ""I'll never be able to use this in my job, so why bother?""

I really, really want to leave but I'm too afraid to do anything. This is the only job I've ever had and I didn't finish school. If I leave, will anyone ever hire me again? Shouldn't I be happy to have a job at all?

It's supposed to be normal, everyone says ""Oh I'm so forgetful!"" all the time like it's a quirk and it's okay.  I've always felt that way, but in the past few years it's been affecting my work and personal life and it's led me to believe that it might be slightly more serious.  You know when you walk into a room and you forgot why you came in?  Or you put down an object and then ten seconds later you forgot where you put it?  I have that problem a lot.  I'm horrible with names, although I honestly think that just might be mental laziness with meeting new people.  While living with my girlfriend last year there were many times when she, a normally very calm and understanding person, became completely flustered and frustrated with my incredible ability to forget important dates, names, and locations.  



I recently had to list my work history and living history for the past five years, and I've moved around a lot.  I could remember all of the apartments and jobs, and eventually found all the addresses, but as for the dates I was utterly lost, even for jobs earlier this year.

A lot of it seems to be tied to poor spatial awareness.  I am the KING of getting lost, even in my home town.  I couldn't ""point"" you anywhere as I have no idea which direction I came from or where anything lies relative to me.  If I learn a path or route that I take consistently, then I'm fine.  But if there is a detour and I'm forced to figure out a way around it, I'll spend twenty minutes making u-turns and missed exits until I get lucky and find my path again.

But really why I'm writing this is because of a specific and very consistent sort of mistake that I make at work.  It's something that becomes much worse under stress, and I'm pretty much always stressed at work.  When given a set of tasks to be completed, I will always forget the last task.  I'm a cook, so I often have 15 things going on at once for prep work, but it's always that last part of a series that I just blank on. 

Examples:  

* When making the fire for the pizza oven, we have to open the front door in case smoke pours into the room.  Despite how hard I try and how much shit I catch for it, I forget to close this door once I get the fire going.  I'm actually terrified of forgetting because the manager has screamed at me the past three times, but it still happens.  

* When making sauces, if there is a final step, I'll miss it.  Throwing in herbs, mounting with butter, seasoning....all the time.  

* I forget garnishes all the time.  I'll have the chef freaking out at me after the fourth consecutive time, and I'll be making a genuine effort to try and remember but it just fucking escapes me.  I don't understand it.  

* When making doughs, we roll them out and par-cook them for about ten seconds.  I'm usually fine with remembering to grab them after the ten seconds, but if ANYTHING disrupts my train of thought during that time, I will forget and burn the dough.  If I throw a dough in, walk to my station, and someone says ""Hey"" to me, it's like it instantly resets my mental cache and I'll forget about the dough.  Every. Time.

These are just examples at work, but it's really applicable to my whole life.

So what the hell is going on?  It's only been getting worse in the past few years.  I think it might be due to and exacerbated by stress, which I have in abundance.  I'm trying so hard to fight it and I feel like an idiot, but it continues...

The background is my brother (25) has had a history of impulsive behavior, and lack of acknowledging his own faults/short comings. I tried to talk to him once while he was driving us back home about what happened the night he punched me, and he continually said that I ""slapped"" him first. Then, after I claimed otherwise, he went completely blastic-ape-shit on and started yelling at the top of his lungs, pounding the steering wheel, and going on about how he was tired of my ""know it all, collegiate attitude and a bunch of other random nonsense. Luckily he didn't run into anything, but when we got back home he just brushed off his outburst saying something like ""Yeah well that's what happens when you open a can of worms"". He didn't admit anything he did was crazy (again) and acted like it just ""happened"", and couldn't control it. 

What's more worrisome to me is, despite him having affection to firearms (and having quite an armory nowadays) when I told my parents about both incidents, neither one took it seriously.  I swear, after reading some of the psy reports of some know school shooters, he sounds eerily similar to them. EX: 0 Empathy, violent outlook on things, believe women have to be kept on a leash (failed dating), thinks he knows best, isolated, and thinks people deserve what ever happens to them.
I'm afraid he's just going to loose it one day out of the blue and do something stupid, but I don't want to talk to him about because last time I did he flipped shit while driving, and if he didn't have to have his hand on the wheel....anyway, what do I do with this guy?
Thanks

**EDIT**: thanks for the advice everyone, but despite those incidents, I know there's a decent person there, we just had a vacation to visit relatives on the East coast, and he acted a lot more relaxed(bit of an attention whore) but more happy around the cousins. I wanted to be happy for him, but I kept thinking of that hairpin trigger that could make him flip out again at any moment and guard what I say. Also, yes he's 25 living with our Dad, but the reason for that is he *was* in the military for 5 years, (no IED's or firefights or anything that major, declared he hated all Iraqi's for being there, said something about ""I would rather blow up a school of Iraqi's than loose one of my men"" when he was a Sgt. for about a year, thing he mentioned that seemed to upset him the most was being yelled at for loosing something in the armory, that's it) but he's been home almost a year looking for a private contracting job (no one wanted him, surprise) and I believe he's thinking about going back to finish his 3 years in college. I think if he actually had more of a social life he would be better, but sucks at meeting new people, makes excuses for everything. Plus, he's gotten better being around my dog (barely). The incidents happened sometime last Sept. or so. But with all his past actions plus not, as far as I can tell, have anything to live for, superiority complex, he seems unstable at best. Parents reactions were ""Well I didn't see what happened"" and that I should apologize to him for, I guess, putting my head in the way??? Because if they think I slapped him first, they must imagine me strolling up to him and waving my hand at him with a high toned voice saying ""Don't kick my *doooog* bitch!"" slap you!

Advice please.",18,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/xhddc/my_dad_had_passed_away_in_my_freshman_year_in/,"Well fuck. Here's my story.

I got a full scholarship from an oil company from home to study in UT. In my first semester, dad's tumor had hit him hard--it killed him in December 25th. I got anxiety attacks in that semester. I had the pleasure to go back and be with him in his last days. Shit was tough. In his last days, he pulled a gun on my older sister and asked her, ""What would happen if I just shoot you now?"" He was hallucinating those days and thought his was seeing his dead aunt. I bought him diapers because the drugs fucked his bowels. I carried his naked body from the bathroom floor a few times when he tried to clean his feet using the sink. Muslims clean their feet with sinks, or shower, before praying. I recall that my little brother of age eight running upstairs and telling me to help dad because he fell in the bathroom. Cancer is nasty--we all know that.

So dad died and I went back to UT. I smoked a lot of pot--it numbed me. Some people I had met in the dorms became friends because, well, they knew about what was going on in my life--I had had no one to talk to, so I had relied on strangers. They are good friends now.

I did well in the spring and became a pothead. In my first summer in UT, I tried shrooms and ecstasy--softish drugs. They numbed more. They were fun. As I write this, I realize how generic this sounds, but oh well, druggies. Drugs work for a while then they rape you.

My second year was fine too. I did more ecstasy and more shrooms and started drinking alone. Things were okay as long as I had a capsule with white powder that brought vivid memories of dad. I talked to those capsules alone. They were good friends. I stopped smoking and drinking because molly, I thought, was better. It pushed me through this solitary grief. I started eating more caps. Then pedestrians started to morph to monsters when I was walking to class. (they don't anymore.)

I had kept doing that shit, then I had got into heavier stuff: coke, bars, and opes. It had become normal to get wasted and blame dad's dying to why I was snorting those lines and sticking syringes in my butt.

Then it got dark. Suicidal ideations woke me up and threw me to sleep. Whiskey was my food. My identity crises was peeking too: how do you deal with living in Saudi after college when you know you are an atheist. A girl I had loved dumped me. My roommate left to Chicago. Shit kept piling. Then, my days were spent as 15 hours of sleep and 9 hours of drunk. I was pathetic.

Eventually I decided to get professional help. They threw me in a mental hospital and shoved me with Wellbutrin. They took blood and urine samples. My sponsoring company knew about the traces of coke and opes and bars from the samples, and eventually gave me the choice to go back home or lose the grant. I went back home then realized that home is a bad call, so I came back without the company's knowledge.

My government also offers full grants, and I lied to myself in believing getting one is going to happen. It didn't. They told me that since I've been in school for four years, I need to prove to them that no one sent me here (a proof I don't have), and I need to explain why I took two semesters off. Mom can't do $50k/year for two years.

I had taken some benadryl, before getting the email that said I didn't get the grant, to sleep, because I haven't slept for a day because I was cramming for a midterm I had today.

I'm considering lapsing. But whiskey is working for now.

I can't study back home because I bailed on the only good college I had registered to there and flew off with no notice.

What should I do? I mean, fuck, I'm finally giving a fuck about school; I finally feel like a normal, whatever that means, college student, but can't be one as far as I know.

I have written a poem, and that has worked for minutes, but sometimes, even art can't explain how big of a fuck up you are.

Americans, I know my situation might be different, but fuck giving up on dreams--there has to be an answer.

**TL;DR: cancer is bad, drugs are bad, home sucks, no money for college.**

There are probably a few wrong tenses and a few repeated sentences ... I'd usually care to edit them, but, you know, grammar is low in my priority list today. Sorry writers who are getting pissed off by my sloppy and raw style.

EDIT: My mom has been working with the government to see if there's a chance of giving me the grant.

I am currently a computer science student at a pretty well known college. I am doing a year long internship at the moment before I go into my final year. 

Comp Sci wasn't my first choice. I switched plans many times. Then I took an introductory programming class, and I was good at it, so I decided I'd go into comp sci.

However, over the last 4 years and now in my internship, I have found that I do not enjoy programming. It's mind-numbingly dull for me, and it terrifies me that I am setting myself up to this for the rest of my life. The reason I find it boring is because I feel confined to my desk. There is limited social interaction, since programming is largely solitary. Sure, you have meetings to discuss features, but then you sit behind your computer for a few more hours, wondering what the heck the guy who programmed the program before you was thinking.

I know I want to finish my degree. I've worked too hard at it not to, and I wouldn't be able to afford more years of college. But I also know I do not want to do this for the rest of my life. But I don't know what else I would or could do. I enjoy photography, but mostly nature and landscapes, which don't provide a lot of job opportunities. I like travelling, but fat chance I can make money with that. I do want to teach abroad for a year after graduating, though. I also like writing, and I'm good at it if I take my time; this post was made in about 10 minutes, so some grammar might be off.

I feel like I have exhausted all of my options and I am getting more and more upset about this situation. 

I moved in with my boyfriend about 4 months ago and about the same time one of his roommates girlfriend moved in at the same time. We have another roommate, so there are 5 of us in our pretty big house.
my roommates girlfriend is an amazing person, she goes to school and has a job and I would consider her one of my best friends. He is extremely verbally abusive to her and it has been escalating for months now. When i first realized what was going on, I had a conversation with my boyfriend about it and he expressed the same concerns to me. 

I have somewhat expressed my concern to her because I was in an abusive relationship for 3 years. I don't want to get involved but seeing and hearing everything between them reminds me of all the abuse I have been through and tears me down. She and I have a great relationship as best as we can, he refuses to let her see me or hang out with me whenever he is around. (if he goes to work we can talk for a little bit but if he is at home he makes her stay in her room.) No one really understands why he wont let us hang out and all he says is that I am a bad influence. 

The reason I am asking for advice now is because the other night our mutual friend came over for a bbq, my roommate, boyfriend and him were drinking and he was starting to get out of control to everyone. His girlfriend left for work (she works graveyard) and they all kept drinking. Around 2 am our other roommate came home and had a few drinks with them... then all hell broke loose, the 2 roomies got into a MASSIVE argument and started swinging at each other saying they were going to kill each other and everything. I came running out of my room to see my boyfriend carrying the roommate who came home late outside and I asked the other one to just go upstairs to his room for a few minutes to cool down. He then started freaking out at me (I was calm at this point) and pushing me and started swinging. my boyfriend came running to my rescue and I went back to my room to calm down (never been threatened before).  After awhile it all calmed down and his girlfriend called him to check on him and he said some of the worst things I have ever heard anyone say to another person. 

I have been keeping to myself since this whole ordeal and just trying to figure out what to do. As I was typing this his girlfriend just came down to ask the specifics about that night since her boyfriend has been here the whole time and she hasn't had an opportunity to talk to me. She informed me that yesterday while they were in their room and their friend was over she was on facebook and a childhood friend messaged her, he saw this and flipped out, he grabbed her laptop from her and threw it at her hitting her in the face and called her a cunt. She started crying while telling me this and I did too. 

She knows my history, she confides in me about everything going on and I just don't know what to do to help her. I don't want to get too involved because it isn't my relationship but it affecting me any my other roommates.

Over the last few years I've been noticing a consistent change in my perception of reality and humanity. I started having dis-associative thoughts, like I wasn't part of humanity moving around me. This seemed to have started in HS initially with extreme sociopathic tendencies (""If I stabbed and punched this person next to me in the hallway would anything actually happen? Are they actually real?"" Etc.) After a while I guess I pushed this under from fear of what I was feeling (and that I was smart enough to know the consequences IF the person I hit were real, of course). Things settled down for a while and I tended to ignore the strange self-disturbing ways I looked at the world around me.  

I think lately though it's sort of changed into a new, more mature, and not entirely undesirable (at least to me) direction.

It may sound kind of cheesy, but it got to where I became more and more disturbed that I agreed with Garland Greene's line from Con-Air:

*What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to piss off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time? Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?*

I guess looking in on the quote it's not so disturbing, but the character it came from is quite disturbing obviously, so I was bothered to realize I was taking what I see as sound philosophical advice from a fictional serial killer.

In any case, fast forwarding to today. 

I rent a house with my wife and child. I see people mowing their lawns, taking out the trash, washing their cars, going to work, coming home, playing basketball in the front yard. When I start to think about the monotonous repetition of all of this I get headaches, my mood goes down the toilet for days, etc. It wasn't until a few months ago that I think I realized why I was subconsciousness greatly disturbed by what I was witnessing.

*Nothing is really happening*, all I see is a holding pattern for life. Millions of people looking like they are doing important things without actually doing a single important thing. Just living and not really doing anything. What shocks me to the core about this is that I see myself caught in the cogs of what I guess I could call this social, racial machine. Now I catch myself mowing my lawn; drinking coffee before driving to work in the morning; cleaning a house; washing a car etc. and this makes me sick when I think about it. 

In my opinion what this all feels like is that all the human race has attempted to do for so long is to survive on our tough planet. Once large portions of us finally pull it off and develop reasonably safe and beneficial social accommodations with each other (and thus 1st world societies) we've effectively beaten the *only* goal humanity ever had. Now it's a big case of buying that MMORPG account, beating the 100hr main quest-line, and then messing around at the end doing BS fetch quests and grind missions because you bought the damn game, have the damn account, and don't have anything really meaningful left in the game to do.

So my question is this: What do we do now?

I feel like no matter what I do, even if it were something so arrogant as to assume that I could cure some disease, what would that really accomplish? To me that would just be a further refinement of our instinctual drive to survive, albeit on an scientific intellectual basis. I feel like practically the entire human race has voluntarily decided to enter some limbo of subconsciousness where we just mindlessly wander around once we don't have starvation breathing down our necks and lions at our heels (insert first-world-problems woman here I guess).

I'm not even that old, but all I have to my name is a savings account and an associates degree in psych. I'm concerned that it may already be too late for me to put the brakes on this train because of how easily it is to fall into this life pattern so many other people have no problems with.

It's gotten bad enough that my brain occasionally flashes pictures in my head of what it thinks I would look like tramping through some south american jungle or scuba-diving in the Caribbean. In real life I'm pretty sure I would *hate* doing this stuff but I think my brain is telling me something, about how I am massively displeased with the direction my life is evolving and it's using imagery to tell me this.

I guess most of this is just kinda ranty or whining/complaining, but it really feels like billions of people are all simultaneously wasting their lives... I'm a big sci-fi buff and I've read/seen too much of it to *not* know humanity's potential when it's united in a common goal. I'm just so bothered that we've made it thousands upon thousands of years, finally mostly conquering survival, and then just ending up puttering around wasting our time. As if we are culturally/species-ally not ready for this gift, and we don't know what to do with it.

In the end on random days this mostly just sends me into a hyper-critical depression spiral and I feel stuck in my own situation... 

So yeah I guess it would be nice to have some people here to talk to about this and how I feel and what, if anything, we can do about it.

This will sound really really bad but there's no other way to put it. I love my mother dearly, but she's turned into a simpleton. 

She used to be very intelligent. She went to college, excelled, and could learn new things. She used to be able to pick up new skills and technologies, but over the past several years that's declined. She's now incapable of learning anything new. We've had computers in the house for as long as anyone else has, but she still can't pick up how to use them beyond how to open her e-mail and play solitaire.

She can't create folders, organize files, or pull pictures off her camera. You might say ""Well, some people are just bad with technology."" But no, I have been showing her how to do it over and over again for **years**. I even make her step by step tutorials **with pictures**. And she still somehow doesn't get it. (Or she loses the tutorials). Every time she needs to do something, she tries to get me to do it. I can't tell you how many times she needs me to attach a picture to her e-mail, despite me showing her over and over again how to do it. **She has just stopped learning.**

Technology is just one example, but the inability to learn has spread to just about every other facet of life. ""Maybe she's just getting old?"" 

**My mother is only 55**.

What's worse than her inability to learn is how she acts. She acts like a child sometimes. She'll be very passive aggressive if I won't do everything for her, and she'll even scream, hit me, and storm off. If I ask her to help me with something when it is an inconvenience to her, she'll whine and complain and refuse to do it. I'm the only person who walks the dogs. If I'm busy and ask if she could help me out by walking them, she whines and refuses because she's too busy watching tv. She never exercises, and thus she's obese. She much rather watch a TV show about weight loss than actually work on losing weight.

Which brings me to my next issue with her: All she does is watch shit TV. Her entire world revolves around shit TV. All she thinks about and talks about now is Dancing with the Stars, American Idol, Survivor, Big Bang Theory, E! Entertainment News, Dr. Oz, etc... When she gets home from work, she immediately plops down in front of the TV and watches crap until she absolutely has to get up to defrost something for dinner.

As such, I am unable to have an intelligent conversation with her. She can talk well enough, but she's now unable to intelligently discuss ideas beyond her tv shows. I feel like she's turning into an idiot from Fahrenheit 451 or Brave New World. 

She completely lacks any critical thinking skills. She used to have them, but now they're gone. She believes everything Dr. Oz or Oprah tells her to believes. She regurgitates what they say as if it's her own original thoughts. She's completely helpless when it comes to advertising claims. **If some food product makes an ""it's healthy"" claim on the box, she feels it's free points and that she can eat as much of it as she wants.**

The other week at dinner she was seriously telling the family that she believes El Nino was causing the current rough patches in life that her friends were going through. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; The weather on the other side of the world is responsible for your friend's cancer, and your other friend backing out of his driveway and hitting a car? W.T.F.?

Half the time I feel like I'm babysitting her, and it's killing my relationship with her.


My mother wasn't always like this. She used to be an intelligent, capable woman. I don't know what happened, but I'm worried for her. I know she's stressed out, and has difficulty sleeping at night, but I don't know if that explains her decline in intelligence over the past few years.

My father has expressed similar concern in the decline in her mental abilities, but I don't think he's willing to take her to see a doctor just yet. I think she really needs help, but I don't know how to bring it up to her without her throwing a tantrum and storming off.",,False,,t5_2r367,1337625505.0,,,True,t3_txv4m,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/txv4m/how_can_i_tell_my_mother_i_think_she_needs_mental/,

I thought I had done *enough* to pass my courses, the bare minimum, but evidently I didn't do well enough on one of the finals.  I found out early that I've received a failing grade.

I've been struggling since the end of junior year.  At that time, I felt I needed time off to get myself together; the school tends to be accommodating for semesters off, but I was afraid to go through with it and went back anyways.  As a result, I had to take an incomplete grade in one of my classes that semester, which is still outstanding.  I've been seeing a counselor twice a month for the past couple of years to manage my issues; it was clear to me that I was getting worse and worse.  Late in the semester I broke down and checked into the psychiatric wing of the local hospital for four days' observation.  It put me behind in everything.

If I call my parents and tell them, I know they'd be disappointed but understanding.  That's the way they are.  Even so, I'm scared to pick up the phone.  Their plane comes in tomorrow.  I was going to pick up my cap and gown tomorrow, though I'm not sure if they'll still allow it.

Ordinarily, I would go back for an extra semester and graduate in fall.  My family can't afford that, though; my college fund is exhausted.  My original plan at the beginning of senior year was to take two partial-load semesters, but we couldn't afford that either.

I was planning on using this time to finish a spreadsheet for aircraft design, which is due tomorrow.  I was planning on doing it overnight, presenting a draft to the professor in the morning, and tweaking it further for a couple of hours if needed.  I don't think I can do it any more; I'm a bit shaken.

My brother is driving my family apart. He's a 30-something educated divorced father who doesn't want to work or move out of my moms house. Ever since I can remember he's been nothing but trouble. From stealing my fathers credit card and going on shopping sprees. The sad part is my mother always defends his actions and NEVER EVER punished him. He graduated from a good university and easily landed a high-paying job. I'm not sure what happened, because of his inability to tell the truth, but 4 months later he was jobless. After that he never really tried to get or keep a job. My mother has been supporting him ever since. 

 He manipulates my mother into supporting him and his family. About two years ago he got a giant chunk of her savings by spewing possible investments in some bullshit. Then spent 6 months with his buddy traveling, getting high, and partying every night. Consequently his wife decided she had enough of the games and moved back home with her kids... they haven't spoken since. When my mom found out what he had done she finally said she had enough. She kicked him out and told him to find somewhere else to stay. This was honestly such a relief. He has been sucking our family dry for years. 

Our uncle took him in, but we all knew it wasn't a solution. Fast-foward 2 months he's back on doorstep acting completely crazy. Claims the president sent him letters, then the next minute he's standing in a corner staring at a wall, and then he's taking off his shirt and throwing random stuff away.  My mom completely fell for this charade despite my sister (who is currently getting her masters in psychology) pleas. He moved back in. We took him to see someone which was completely useless since he doesn't say a word during sessions. After a few weeks, the crazy went away. My sister decides to approach him and ask ""what are your future plans blah blahs blah"" Then bam! three days of crazy. My mother broached the subject a few days after the crazy went away and BOOM.. more crazy. The crazy only comes out when he wants it to come out. We all see it, but my mom does not. 

He's really ruined her financial future, and she can't afford to live without our support. I don't mind supporting her, but it's not just her it's him too and his wife and kids. I can't deal with this anymore, but if I leave now I'll be severing my relationship with my mother and I can't abandon my sister. I have no idea what to do.

I went to see a Dr. who tested me for H. Pylori, and said it is probably from a G.E.R.D. or hernia. I cut out all foods that were oily, heavily spiced, or that had tomato products in it. Really all I ate was chicken, romaine lettuce, black beans, and potatoes. The Dr. Prescribed Nexium (heart burn medication) and this is where the anxiety got worse. About 40 minutes after taking the medicine I started getting pins and needles everywhere on my body. I freaked out and went back to the Dr. who said it might be some type of allergic reaction. Then things got bad.

 I developed a phobia of having allergic reactions to foods, medicines and have not been eating healthy for the past two years. I understand that my fears are irrational, and that I won't die if I eat foods. But because its been so long since I had a normal diet, its very difficult to introduce new foods into my diet.

I know that there are probably a bunch of people out there that love me, and care for me and all that, just lately I've been feeling as if no one does. I hate laying my problems out for others to see, and always try to put on a 'front' of happiness in public so that everyone else won't know that I'm actually upset. But I'm fucking sick of it. I'm tired of hiding my emotions from everyone else, so I'm typing this out.


First of all, I think that's one of my main problems. I shield myself from the outside world too much, and I'm too goddamn afraid to speak my mind, so I don't hurt anyone else's feelings, that I just end up pretending to feel stuff that I actually don't. I'm worried that if I say what's on my mind, my friends would get mad, and 'not like me anymore', or some shit...


I don't have many friends either. Basically just two good ones, but I don't feel much appreciation out of them either. One of them acts like he owns the rest of us. Huge fucking ego, and it's really starting to piss me off. He always dumps his problems on us, and when we try to help, doesn't listen and tells us that he's ""not in the mood"". Annoying as hell. Then when either of us utters the most minute complaint, he goes off and tells us to stop complaining. Basically, he thinks that he's above us in some way. Definitely doesn't treat me with respect, let alone my other friend. I seem to get more respect out of him when I ignore him. It's not like I enjoy ignoring him though, I just want to be god damn friends without this whole 'hierarchy' shit.


Then my other friend. She's only really ever concerned about herself, and my other friend. If he tells her to do something. She does it, no questions asked. When I want her to do something, she'll take her damn time, if at all. This doesn't really pertain to anything, but she also feels the need correct everything everyone does. I think she has a need to feel 'smarter' than everyone else. Because she often complains about hating people because they make her feel 'stupid'.


It really just PISSES me off that everyone always seems to be competing against everyone else. I don't give a shit if you're better than me at something, and I don't give a shit that you're smart. All I ask for is a little respect.


Neither of them listen to me, they treat me like I don't have feelings, they always ask each other for help, but never ask me. They act like they're 'competing' with me, or something. I. DON'T. GIVE. A. SHIT. Compete with someone who cares! I just want to be your friend.

Sorry, I needed to get that off my chest... it's not just them either. I don't have many friends at school either. Minor acquaintances, who have all split up into their tightly knitted 'cliques' and stuff already. So I'm basically alone there too. Not like I don't try to integrate myself, people just never listen when I speak up; and I can only take so much. 


I think my fear of hurting people's feelings and under-confidence has made me afraid to speak my mind. It makes me awkward as hell in a conversation, and I HATE it. But I want to be able to express myself to my friends. I want to feel respected by them, and at the very least, appreciated.

Sorry for that long-ass rant.

TL;DR: I feel unloved and unappreciated by my friends, and pretty much everyone else in my life. No one seems to value my opinions, ignores me when I speak up, so I just don't anymore.

Chemistry, Maths, and Economics. 

I quite literally do not think I have studied enough. Most of the other people I know say that, but actually they study more than I do. 

I think I might have had a nervous breakdown yesterday. Crying for no reason and freaking out really badly. I feel like some of the symptoms of depression. (But I don't think I qualify for that, it's just the stress? I think?) 

I've never been so nervous for an exam and so apathetic, I've skipped consultations with teachers, I can't do any practice papers, I can't write any notes, I can't study, I can't think, I can't focus. 

The whole problem gets worse: because I can't think, I can't do the papers, and because I can't do them I get more depressed and apathetic and then I can't think. 


It's an awful vicious cycle that I can't seem to break out of. 



I grasp vague generalities(outlines) and not details and things like *not-knowing-details* is what's causing me to not do well. And I don't have mental stamina so the back of the papers are all wrong. (and not being organised, but planning before writing should help that?)

It's even more frustrating feeling I'm already kind of out of the bracket of being able to date a college girl. (I did not do any partying or a ton of socializing when I was in college.)

When they get off, they push him and shove him around, laugh at him and shout his name and cat-call and whistle at him. Every day, he gets on the bus close to, or in, tears.

I realise this isn't the full extent of the bullying, it's only the tiny portion I see, and nothing makes me angrier than a group of bullies ganging up on some defenseless kid.

We live together and have an almost-4 year old daughter. He has not worked since 2007 because of his condition and his medication (which he takes very consistently), so I have been the sole earner for the family since then. He applied for disability in 2009 and this monday is his hearing. Tomorrow is our daughter's 4th birthday.

Yesterday, he started getting very stressed out due to the hearing, and I set him off. It was something that I knew would set him off, but I was pretty stressed at the time too, so I just did it anyway. I moved his dresser, which is something he had asked me not to do. He went a bit off the hook and started throwing things around. He never has physically hurt me in the 14 years we have been together, and he has not ever seriously injured himself, though he makes threats to kill himself occasionally. Anyway, I call 911 because I'm panicked, and after she asked my address, she said a neighbor already called and cops (because of the yelling) were on their way. I informed officers on the phone that there were no weapons in the house, except a taser that was out of juice (from years ago when we worked at a shady rv park) and a couple kitchen knives, and no guns.

So my husband talks to an officer on his phone and he invited them to come up, offered his ss# and they were also informed by both him and I that he had schizophrenia and was not homicidal, or any harm to me or anyone else, only potentially to himself. I ended up taking my daughter outside to talk to the cops and fill them in (I was very surprised to see more than 1 or 2 cops - in fact there were a few more. 

As I started talking to an officer, I saw my husband exit the apartment's main entrance to smoke a cigarette. At that time, he had not done anything except cause a domestic disturbance. It had already been confirmed by me over the phone that there was no gun or other weapon in the house. It had also been confirmed by me that he was no danger to others, and in my opinion he just needed some additional medication because he was stressed about his upcoming hearing.

As my husband crossed the street, I saw them try to grab him and restrain him, even though he was not under arrest, confirmed to have no weapons in his possession, confirmed to be mentally disabled, and with absolutely no criminal record in his entire adult life. He did communicate with the officers that he was just going to have a smoke.

My husband did not like being grabbed by police officers, so he resisted. He was then tased. My daughter and I saw this and started screaming in horror as he ened up on the ground outside our apartment complex, with an officer's boot on his back. My husband has had recent back injuries, and this incident put him in a lot of physical pain.

He was then handcuffed and sent to a hospital so that a doctor could give him a sedative and do an evaluation to see if they needed to change his medication.

I feel like something went terribly wrong here. I have never seen this type of reaction to a domestic disturbance. I am thinking of contacting NAMI or a mental health association to get advice, and also a lawyer to find out why the police responded in such a violent manner towards my disabled husband.

I've always battled depression. I switched to wellbutrin three weeks ago or something and it is not working. Some days I'm on the verge of crying all day for no reason (and often do). Some weeks I forget to leave the house. Some days I don't see the sun. Some days I hope to never see the next day.

Lately strange things have been happening inside my head. I learned what a panic attack was. Sometimes I'll be woken up by awful, terrible feelings. Last night was such a case, I was woken up around 5:30 with this crushing sensation. My mind kept imagining rounded blocks breathing (shrinking and growing). If I sat still, it felt like my whole body, especially my limbs, were being compressed. Eventually I got back to sleep, but it stayed with me for probably more than a half hour. Tonight I'm afraid to sleep.

Previously, I've had grinding. I was woken up by it. There was this sound in my head like someone stuck a drill up my nose and turned it on. The image was that of a long zigzag concrete hallway, and I was in some kind of vehicle smashing into each side in succession (at about the pace of the drill turning. very fast).

One time I was woken up by the loudest sound I've ever heard. It was a large slam inside my head and after waking up I felt in utter panic. I threw open every blind and turned on every light and eventually it went away.

I'm so scared. I can't go to sleep tonight in fear of being woken up by another horrible mental state. I'm terrified. I don't want to be crazy. I want to be normal. I want to live life. I don't want to be like this or worse

above all, i'm afraid it will drive me to suicide. eventually it might be my only way out. i'm crying. it feels good.

edit. i know a bit about psychology. enough to know that I'm at the prime age for losing my mind and becoming a non-normal person all of a sudden.

My father, pushing 60, just asked my brother and I for money to pay for 3 months worth of back due rent. Total: $1,350.

A little backstory: he used to work for a large multinational but got canned about 8 years ago. He got severance and he decided to start his own business with it, which failed in about a year. He spent all of his severance on it. He now has another business which is obviously not yielding enough cash. He's also currently looking for a job.

He's re-married, to someone about 5 years my senior... She doesn't really work, but does some free-lance stuff, so ""she's been paying the bills"", according to my Dad. She recently took $30,000 from an older family member of hers to buy a car. She also frequently travels by invitation from this family member. (e.g. this family member pays for it...)

I know that I will not *loan* my father any money, but just give it to him if my wife and I decide to do so. However, I don't see an end to this unless he makes some drastic changes. It seems he believes he will get different results by doing the same thing over and over, and frankly I don't see that he's *killing himself* to improve his situation.

However, if I don't help him out, he will probably not pay rent and get kicked out. He also won't have money for a new place...

What's also interesting to note is that my father , when he was doing well, gave his father (my grandfather) money every month to help *him* out. I don't want to do the same: I have my own family and life to take care of.

So, reddit, what to do? Anyone else been in a similar situation? Your thoughts, please?

The last time I saw him in person was six years ago when I drove 8 hours and showed up on his door step to show him his new grandchild. I have made several attempts to reach out to my dad, via phone, invitations, etc. All I get back from him is ""great to hear from you, hope you are well -name"" in a email. I have stepbrothers and a brother who all get phone calls atleast bi-monthly from him. I have been too embarrassed to tell them he hasn't spoken with me in ages.

I always knew growing up I was a bit of the black sheep in the family. Parents divorced, dad immediately moved in with his mistress. I wanted to live with him, but the courts thought otherwise. I later found out from my mom my stepmom didn't like me after meeting me one time when I was 5 or 6. My younger brother got to live with my dad as my stepmom loved him as he was the 'baby' and she got to dress him up and baby him. I was allowed to spend Summers there, but I hated it. My chores from 7-10 years of age were mowing the lawn, raking leaves, sweeping driveway and sidewalk twice a week. My 4 siblings together only had to fold socks and underwear. I did the best I could to brush everything aside. I never spoke up, never got out of line. I maintained straight A's through school. When my stepbrothers got B's and C's, my stepmom said I must be cheating and I was sent to bed without super. My dad never stuck up for me, but I still thought the world of him and considered him my best friend until I turned 25.

After college (didn't finish), I started my own company, sold it, bought a house, started a new one, fell in love, got married, pregnant and called my dad first. He was always cool over the phone when my stepmom wasn't around, but i'll never forget his words that day. ""I hope you are getting an abortion, you have too much to live for."" I told him we were keeping it and it was planned (somewhat) and he hung up the phone. I didn't think maybe that's how he felt about me, but I thought how can he say that about my child? I'm no pro-lifer, unless it's my child. It really hurt me, but a month later he called and apologized, we moved on.
Three years later, pregnant again. This time we decided to tell people in person. I tried my hardest to get my dad to come down to where we lived or get an hour of his time when we'd take a vacation and drive by his place. Always an excuse. So we never told him until the day after the baby was born. It wasn't the way I wanted it, and looking back I should have just caved and told him on the phone. A month later I showed up on his doorstep so he could see his grandchild and that was the last I saw of him. We talked it over, and I thought everything was good. Then the distance between phone calls went from 1 to 2 to 4 to 6 months, then nothing. I have called him and sent cards on Father's Day, My birthday, Xmas, every holiday and non holiday. I leave messages. He is very nice to me in emails, replies to them, but he's my dad. I want to see him or the very least hear his voice. I want him to be a part of his grandchildren's lives.
My wife knows this bothers me. On Xmas, I just sat in a chair staring into space half the day dwelling on this. I always hear holidays are the time family tries to mend fences and reconnect and I get so excited for that reason. By 6pm, I realized he wasn't returning my call and the depression sank in. Help redditors...I really want my father at my daughters birthday party next month. Any suggestions?

food + rent. AMA",16,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/epuaj/tldr_frustrated_canadian_needs_job_to_get_for/,"**It’s a long read, the last paragraph sums it up. Everything else is just background. **
 
In the 2007/08 school year I battled with heavy depression. I was stressed out about my future career, life, and relationship issues mainly stemming from family. My most recent girlfriend at that time had proposed twice. I declined because there were some serious trust and value issues on her part. The depression was ridiculously bad. Getting to class was difficult and I lived on campus. I was agoraphobic. I couldn’t go to the grocery store or step onto the bus because I was so frightened of people and crowds. I drop all my courses first term and failed and passed a course second term. I gained 60lbs rapidly and have the stretch marks across my stomach to prove it. I went from varsity athlete to this sad excuse. After a lot of therapy with a psychiatrist and some anti-depressants, I conquered my depression after a year.

In 2008 I earned my BSc in Botany but failed to launch my career. I was rejected from dental school a year before due to my poor grades. My psychiatrist and I later discovered that I have an undiagnosed learning disability: ADHD (please don’t debate the merits). I wish I knew this starting university. I only found a brief seasonal job after graduation but nothing came up after the end of summer.

I was frustrated, the economy was in ruins and despite my best efforts I couldn’t obtain a job. At the start of 2009 I decided to go back to school in September and learn accounting because 1) good life skills to learn and 2) I thought that there are always jobs for accountants. A nice turn of events happened in March when an acquaintance gave me a gig first helping and then managing his dental clinic. 

When September rolled around I continued working full time there and studied full time too since the classes were in the evening. I worked hard and ended up with a B+/A- average for these courses. It’s not spectacular but I am very proud of this achievement. I continued working FT and studying FT for the next year. 

Last August I quit my job. The work that I was hired to do was nearing completion and I wanted to put my full attention on the September recruitment season. I also uncovered that my boss was logging into his business partner’s and employees’ personal email accounts by using the passwords he had stolen using a keylogger. I didn’t check my email from there but I the best move was to wash my hands, leave with my integrity intact.

Recruitment is important because you can’t become an accountant before you earn a designation. You earn a designation by working for a training firm like PwC, KPMG, Deloitte, EY, etc. It’s like articling for lawyers. 

For recruitment I printed new business cards, impressed the accounting firms while networking, and submitted a great application during recruitment. Not a single interview. They thought I didn’t apply. There was some miscommunication in the application process. I go by my middle name but on the application form it asked for the first and middle separately. They were genuinely impressed but when they looked for my application they said they couldn’t find it. I was there, just under a different first name, I wish they had phoned. We spoke and figured out what when wrong after they completed all their interviews and had already given out all their offers.  

I just worked my ass off the last year to be stumped by this stupid little thing. I am deflated and morale is low. 

I’ve been applying for other career related jobs this entire term while taking one class. I’ve reached the point that I’ll just take any job because I NEED money. Pizzeria a block away was hiring; couldn’t get the job. I’m stressed to the point that when I donate blood the nurses said I had high blood pressure, which feeds the stress. I have to budget for 1 meal a day and bolster the extra calories from the discount Halloween candy I stocked up on. I’ve lost 30lbs (yay?).  I don’t believe in karma but if I did it would leave me frustrated: I’m a good person so why is this happening to me?  I volunteer at a soup kitchen, political party, sit on community committees, regularly donate blood, fundraised for multiple charities in the past, etc. I’ve given a lot to my community so why? 

Stressful situations changes people’s value system and I’m no exception. Maybe Gordon Gekko was right, maybe greed is good. I’ve always looked out for others but maybe it’s time I just look out for myself.  My network or peers can’t help. When I go out and meet peers I notice that ~40% are unemployed. People my age are beginning to emigrate away and find work in the US, UK, Australia, etc. I would go too if I secured the job and visa beforehand.  

**Paying rent is painful. I just reached into my savings this month. I write a new cover letter and submit to a new job posting every other day. It used to be more but it’s exhausting after 3 months. I live in Vancouver and we have 2 serious problems that may become my only options: drugs or homelessness. Some people here water plants and make $120k/yr. I’d rather be a professional criminal using my botany degree and accounting skills than being hungry and homeless citizen.**


**Reddit, I’m 26yr old and I have no idea what to do. I’m not looking for a handout, just advice or knowledge of any job openings. **

As the stranger told me: she left her home, got on a motorized vehicle and the throttle got stuck and now she's screaming in pain in the ER.

Back Story: my sister is a liar, cheat and reliably unreliable. She's the kind of person that will say she'll be there then text for hours during your big moment saying ""got lost"" or ""had to give someone keys"" or ""fell asleep"" all the while giving you the impression she'll show up but never does. It's always lies. I think she actually believes her excuses.

She'll also come over and give you a sob story about how she has no money and needs to use your computer to ""find a job"". You say ok, sure. Use it but I need to get back to work, How does an hour sound?

Cut to 2 hours later and I'm explaining how I set a clear boundary and she needs to give up the goods because I work from home and need to get back to work. This all the while I'm feeding her and giving her things to sell at the local consignment store.

She's been a heroin addict for a few years now. But beyond the heroin she's just your normal trouble maker. Constantly stealing and justifying it because she has no money. To her the world owes her everything. She's a practiced scam artist. Has developed a fake name to go with the fake social security number. This is used with cops and for medical attention.

Over the past year and a half I've kinda cut her off. 

Every reach out I get is over text and in some attempt to help her.

I've moved into the mindset that I do not want to meet her where I am in any but a position of a peer. 

I'm simply broken. I don't want to get hurt anymore. I feel terrible guilt, shame and regret that we don't have a relationship where I can show up to make my little sis laugh in her time of need.

But I can not do it anymore.

I don't want her drama.

I've done my work. I've shaken a lot of the shackles from chaotic family of origin. Got my obsessions, compulsions and addictions under reasonable control.

After getting this phone call today all I could do was imagine the worst. I'd show up to the ghetto hospital. Not be able to find or get in touch with her because as usual she's unreliable.

Let's say I did. Then what?

She's perpetually homeless. She'll want to stay in my tiny apartment I share with my comes-from-a-healthy-family partner. I would never do that to my better half. This is our home and it must be a calm and safe place. After growing up like we did and refuse to live with the same chaos and drama if even for a second.

Ya see, if my sister had the ability to respect the boundaries for others then it would be different. But she is still so incredibly resentful with me and it comes out with every interaction.

I think she looked up to me way to much for my age. In her mind I let her down. 

I'm rambling here aren't I?

here's what I would like. 

Help me find the correct and healthy mind space to deal with her.

I know the hardest part is that I want to change her. I know this is a big part of 12 step/co-dependent work. You must accept that you can't.

But even if I can't. How do I have even the smallest relationship with someone so resentful, so self-centered and so far away from what is actually happening?

and what I mean is she did this to herself. Her carelessness is a part of her disease. She is actively trying to hurt herself.

I made it clear 3 years ago. If you end up in jail, I will not bail you out.

Two weeks ago I was let go from a job at a doggy-daycare in Chicago. I worked there only two weeks. Although I have experience working with dogs, this job wasn't right for me so I was planning on giving my two weeks notice the day I was fired. The circumstances surrounding the firing were super sketchy, but I didn't protest because I wanted to leave. Two things that were extra weird: 1) The receptionist (snobby hipster who hated me) told me, alone, at the end of the day, that I wouldn't be needed anymore and I needn't bother talking to anyone else; 2) She accused me of loosing control of the dogs after she left the gate unlocked twice and I had to leap over a fence and push dogs that weigh more than me back into the pen to prevent a total disaster.

This place was completely chaotic. Getting bit was to be expected, dogs have teeth after all. (The veterinarian I worked for before did not find this acceptable, ever!) I'm a petite, non-smoking, socially awkward girl-nerd. I did not fit in at this crusty hipster-run dog place. I was relieved that I didn't have to get up at 5 AM the next day and work outdoors in the cold. I also was immediately offered a temp job, so there was no time to wallow or get angry. I didn't talk to the owner because I didn't want to cry or further embarrass myself, and I knew I had nothing to gain. I worked there for 2 weeks, so of course I won't put this on my resume or use them as a reference.

I was fired on a Thursday and my paycheck arrived by mail on Tuesday, before I even had a chance to try and retrieve it.. About a week after I deposited the check, the money came back out of my account. The transaction just showed up today, but I've hd a negative balance all week. (I've been meaning to call my bank, but I've been really busy.)
Now my checking account is at -$121 because I made a payment on my credit card after the paycheck showed up in my account online. I was also charged a $33 overdraft fee. I plan on calling my bank tomorrow.

I am trying to keep calm, but I am trembling all over. I am so completely panicked. I know it's illegal to not pay an employee, but what can I do? Will a lawyer help me? I have NO money. Less than that! I have negative money. And this paycheck is only for about $550, but I need it really bad. Should I have a friend call them pretending to be a legal service or a lawyer's assistant? Should I pay a lawyer to send them a scary letter? Should I have sex with a lawyer so he'll do this? Should I call 911 and tell them to arrest my ex-boss? How much would it cost me to take them to small claims court? More than my measly paycheck? Please advise me, Reddit, because I feel like jumping in front of a train.

First off, my father never abused me. He always provided me with what I needed, raised me well, educated me and raised me to be agnostic ""We have Jewish, Muslim and Christian relatives - respect that so they can respect your belief too."" He and my mother have been married for 17 years. He's funny, understanding and loves me.

So, 19 years ago, he had been dating my mother for 3 years but he was in medical school. For his last year, he had to leave her for his last year and he moved half way around the world for a year. They talked about it and he told my mother that when he was able to support her, he would come back. From the way they put it, they were not broken up and was doing a long distance relationship. 

My mother then hung out with her friends and got drunk. She said she was young and got drunk. Subsequently a guy at the party (doesn't even remember his name) took advantage of her and got her pregnant. She said she was thinking of aborting me but decided against it. She had me by herself and told me that she did not have the strength to tell my father over the phone or in a letter. She wanted to tell him face to face but did not want to ruin his life by adding turmoil (remember, my father was going to school and she didn't want to stress him out). She never mentioned to him that I was born or that I even existed. This went on like this until he came back (1 year 2 months later). 

He found out about me the 2nd day he came back. At first he was mad, but he said ""Then you came into the room and I realized I shouldn't be mad around children."" Subsequently, he forgave my mother. He then married my mother (who was being ostracized by her family) and told everyone that I was his daughter. His brother said, ""That's bullshit and you know it!!"" Then my father threw him across the room (literally over a dining room table and then leaped over to kick the shit out him for suggesting other wise. Yes, my father is awesome. My uncle is a serial cheater and is a deadbeat dad to my cousin). No one in my 18 years has ever told me that I was not his biological daughter because of this event. I only found out about this a couple of months ago.

So, when I was turning 18 my parents sat me down and told me my story. I cried and got angry. I called him a liar and blamed my mother for acting like a ""whore"". They've been lying to me all my life. But now, my anger has faded away and I have gotten my perspective back. 

I was raised by a wonderful man who raised me as best he could, he gave me everything I needed and loves me. I just turned 18 and our family lawyer just advised me that I can now access my account which has over 400K in it from my father who has created a college fund for me. A fund he has created from his first paycheck. He has led a comfortable but humble life, a ""do it yourselfer"", donated to charity and has volunteered his services in South East Asia. 

I have a ""half brother"" whom I've always known as my brother. When I was young, I got jealous when he was born because of all the attention he got. I remember my father telling me, ""Honey, he's the baby but I want you to know that you're always my favorite.""   

Now I need your advice.  How do I show up at his house after lashing out at him, calling him a liar and calling my mother a whore? I'm so humiliated by how I acted that I don't think I can face him again. I keep crying every time I think about it. I've never really seen my father cry before I lashed out at him. 

**Update**: *Freaking out, I called them. They insisted that they come over. Be here tomorrow. I know what to say, just don't know how to say it. Just waiting for my mom to give me her flight information so I know when they're coming in.*

A few years ago I came into some money and decided to use it to pay off my student loan. After paying it off, money continued to be deducted from my salary. After some correspondence it was admitted that this was in error and I was given a cheque for the value of the deductions. At that point the deductions didn't happen again... until a few months later.

So I contact them again and they apologised for the error and again wrote me a cheque and ensured me that it would not happen again. Another few months passed and everything was fine - until, again another deduction was made. This time I sent them a hand written letter and had it sent via recorded delivery. I made it clear to them that they need to nip this in the bud and that if it was to happen again, I would have to take the matter further because it's theft and because I'm wasting so much time in dealing with them. This seemed to have driven the point home as no deductions were made for an extended period.

I don't like displaying any type of emotion, especially the kind where I end up looking like a tool. Ergo, throwaway account. 

Anyway, onto my issue.
A few years ago, when I was 12 and my brother was 6 or so, my mother met a guy online. They talked, and she decided she wanted to leave my stepdad for this guy. So, instead of filing for divorce or anything else a mature adult would do, she packed her bags, dropped me and my brother off at my grandmother's house and took off to meet internet dude #1. I was loyal, and brainwashed, and ill-informed, so I was all for her pursuing her ""true love"" from the internet. Eight days later, after I hadn't heard from her, she came back, and begged my stepdad to take her back, and he did.

A year later, it all happened again. Except this time she's developed an alcohol problem. Meets a guy online, disappears for &gt;1 week, begs stepdad to come back, and he accepts. 

Two years after that, she meets a new guy. In Africa (she was in the US), no less. So one day she calls up my stepdad while he's at work and says ""I'm leaving, bye,"" she hops in a cab and she's off to the air port, headed for Africa. I don't hear from her for two weeks, and I start to assume she wound up homeless and murdered. 

Suddenly, one day, I get a goddamn email from her. ""I love you, I just wanted to let you know I'm okay. Call me."" I ask her when she's planning on coming back, and she isn't. So I call her, and she seems happy as a clam. She's living with the love of her life, married in Africa, and after a few months she says she's pregnant (despite having her tubes burnt a decade ago). I'm stunned by all of this, so I try to maintain as though it didn't happen. 

Eventually, I lose contact with her, then we begin email correspondence. She wants to come back, but my stepdad says no. I check my voicemail on christmas morning; She wanted to let me know that it was all planned out. She *actually* only left because she actually had cancer, and she didn't want us to see her suffer. 

Which is total horseshit. She left a stockpile of chat logs and webcam videos of herself marching the penguin for this guy in Africa. 

There's several things that really piss me off. She could have left if she wanted to, I'm pretty close to be a legal adult by now. My brother, on the other hand, was 9, and super attached to her. He can't even talk about the situation without crying. I love my brother a lot more than I love her, or even myself, so seeing him like that because of her makes my blood boil. The other thing is the non-stop lying. Plus, now that she's gone and everyone's telling stories, I'm finding out about a metric asston of other things she lied about... Like my goddamned education (which now I have to climb an electric fence to get things I shouldn't even need to consider).

So, anyway, here's what I need advice about. My grandmother sees her daughter as an angel. Common excuses are
""She just isn't well, you should forgive her""
""Christ would forgive her""
""It's the only mother you have""
Am I wrong in **not** returning my mother to mommy-dearest status upon her return? Is it wrong that my little brother now wants nothing to do with her? And most of all, how the fuck do I get my grandmother to stop harassing me and my little brother about this? I don't yell, and I rarely let it know that I'm angry or even upset. I feel like I'm on the verge of snapping and yelling at someone because of this. Any time I let someone know that they're bothering me, I'm immediately thrown into the guilt chamber. ""What did I do? I didn't mean to upset you. Remember, I always love you."" I know it's manipulation at it's finest when I look back on it, but I never seem to remember that when I'm staring into teary eyes.

We're all very proud of her achievements and that her hard work and sacrifices have paid off with such distinction.  However, as it stands, it doesn't appear that she'll be be able to go to any of these schools due to our family's financial situation and she's devastated (and in turn, I'm devastated).

In order for her to be considered for any sort of financial aid, the schools require that she submit financial documents and support from both of her parents.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but our parents are divorced and our father provides just the bare essentials for us, financially speaking.  According to his tax return, he makes a significant amount of income, but the absolute income amount isn't the whole picture (he's got a second family, gets taxed up the yin yang, and a good chuck of his salary is in the form of compensation, not actual cash).  Additionally, we've been asking him to provide the required documents for the financial forms since November of last year and he still hasn't done so (too late anyway as the deadlines have passed).  School's won't consider my mother's income alone, even though my father refuses to provide any contributions to my sister's education and his income won't have any bearing on our ability to pay for my sister's college education.

These schools believe that ""while parents may divorce each other, they don't get a divorce from their children"".  As such, both parents are financially responsible for a child's education.  As romantic and idyllic as that sounds, my siblings and I know that reality for children of divorcee's is much different reality.

So far, Duke will only provide $14K a year for my sister and expects my mother to pony up $39K a year for my sister (impossible, to say the least).  Washington and Lee said they wouldn't provide any aid whatsoever because my father didn't submit the required documents in time (this was out of our control and we did everything we could to get him to cooperate).  She just found out yesterday that Yale and Columbia accepted her, but she's pretty certain that they're not going to help her out because of the response she got from Washington and Lee (evidently they use the same information).

She worked hard because she wanted to prove that despite she came from a single-parent home and has a mother that doesn't speak a lick of English, she was still able to overcome these obstacles and succeed.  She's very driven, but we're all at a loss on how we can help my sister achieve her dream.  She was so close to the finish line, but it seems like it was too good to be true anyway.

I really hope I don't sound like a douche.

It would be great if we both just didn't say anything about our beliefs to each other unless it came up in a specific topic. I think she finds my atheism offensive. I don't find any of her beliefs offensive, just exhausting to constantly have to work around in order to have a real conversation with her.

How do I stop?!,14,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1k1st2/i_am_a_trainwreck_how_do_i_stop/,"I have come to accept that I am a complete and utter trainwreck. I am ruining my own life and I dont know why I keep doing it. I am sick!

I used to have many issues with keeping relationships (platonic and romantic) and was a little lost when I was a younger adult, but once I went to college my whole life changed for the better! I had matured, developed interests and confidence, and made some awesome friends that I was so proud to know...but then all of that changed again.

About a year ago I left for a study abroad program in Asia for 6 months. I had a horrid time! I did not get along with anyone in the program and was all out bullied for reasons I still dont understand. It made me feel as if my friendships while in college were just a fluke, since this experience was very reminescent of my pre-college days. I became very depressed and isolated. This feeling carried into my life when I came back to the US.

I had compelted my last semester at Uni with the study abroad program, so I moved home to parents to start applying for jobs and whatnot now that I was done with college and to save money. But home was not a pleasant place. My parents were divorced a few years prior and I was still getting used to it, and it was weird to live between two separate households (where one had a whole new wife in the mix!) while I was moved back home for my post-college days. Also, it was in a town that I had no friends in, I had no car or savings, could not get ANY kind of job (the town has a 17% unemployment rate!!) So I continued to become very depressed and isolated. The point of moving home was to temporarily live there (6 months max) while I applied for jobs to move back to the city where I went to college. However, I applied to over 200 jobs and didnt get a single interview. It was discouraging.

My solution? I didnt file for my bachelors and instead just kept going to school for another semester so I could move back to the city I wanted to live in and my finaid would cover it. I am doing that now. But I have no idea what to do when I am done in a few months. Its back to my situation post-Asia. And I am on a year lease with no income coming in after I graduate (again) in Fall.

Also, I am so over school! I was glad to be graduated the first time. My finaid only covers partial living expenses so I still need a few hundred more a month than finaid pays anyways in order to pay my rent. And I do not have a job while in college (trying to find one...). I had a job for a few weeks that a friend got me, but I blew that quickly. I was so miserable at it, I actually came home crying a few times so I just quit one day despite not having a backup and desperately needing a paycheck. It was a bad decision that I deeply regret.

I also have been acting out in very self-destructive ways. I have been having serious emotional outbursts where I sometimes cry for hours and will call people nonstop until they answer. My friends have just stopped answering (understandably). I have never gotten serious attention from men like I wanted (guys dont see me as ""relationship worthy"") and lately have been aggressively seeking sexual partners and then acting surprised when they tell me its nothing more than FWB. I have essentially slept will all my guy friends and now a few wont talk to me since they got girlfriends and all their girlfriends hate me even though I honestly dont come on to their boyfriends anymore (I would never condone or participate in cheating behavior).

My drinking is out of control. Ive always been a heavy social drinker, but after an incident with a particular guy rejection recently (on top of all the other issues in my life), I have taken it to an extreme. I havent done this much drinking/smoking weed since pre-college years. And this time its worse because its mostly lonely heavy drinking of 1 bottle of wine a night to myself or 4-5 beers a night. LAST NIGHT I GOT A DUI!! Its a problem.

I have essentially ruined or am ruining my relationships with my once coveted friends because of my dramatic antics. I dont know if they are repairable and I feel my reputation is permanently damaged. I also am worried I will never get a good job now that I have a misdemeanor on my record.

I tried going to my university services to get psychological help but I dont feel I can afford the services right now...I need advice reddit on how to turn my life back around!! Why do I fall into these cycles??

I always take the same route home in the evening.

Just one block before mine, there's an apartment on the ground floor, with windows just above head height. It looks kinda dull on the inside from what I can see. No paintings on the wall, bad neon lighting, no curtains, rusty window and some broken bits that have been card boarded up. 

About two days ago, I walk past during the day and look up to see this girl, looks kinda middle eastern or something, naked, giving me this weird weird look. Now don't get me wrong, I've been looked at like that before and it wasn't one of those, or else I wouldn't be typing this right now.. 

I couldn't believe my eyes.. Looked again and just thought what in the heck, why has noone else seen this? 

No worries, fuck it, whatever. It would have been cool if it was just once but I just came back home (it's midnight) and it happened again on the way here. This time she looked like something out of a nightmare. Her skin was dark and dirty looking and her eyes were so light. I got the chills this time and didn't smile.. 

So.. What should I do the next time I see her?

For example, last year my mum found out I had a secret boyfriend, who, although was the same age as me, destroyed her trust in me. I'm a 16 year old girl. I get good grades and I study hard when I need to. I am capable of making my own decisions while considering the consequences of my actions. Yet I tend to forget some things sometimes. 

----

I used to have a brick phone. It was terrible. Finally, my mum agreed to give me a BlackBerry.

I admit, I took some inappropriate pictures I'm not proud of on there. There were some conversations with older men that I truly regret. And contacts which I'd sooner delete than dwell on.

Recently I changed my phone to a contract phone, as my mum thought it was important for me to be able to contact her as the BlackBerry speakers were broken.

One night, I was deleting the incriminating evidence. My battery died, and I fell asleep. I forgot the next morning.

A month later, my sister decides she wants to use the BlackBerry. I allowed it, thinking I had deleted everything.

She saw everything.
The pictures.
The conversations.
The contacts.

She told my mum.

And now I'm in huge trouble.

To add to this, I have unknowingly incurred a £70/$107.68 bill on the new contract phone, and my mum has yet to find out the actual cost. 

They tried to talk to me. They asked me why I did it. They asked me if someone was threatening me, or blackmailing me. I said nothing.

The truth is, I made a mistake. Having so much free time on my hands has made me reckless. I didn't really think the pictures through. I'm not a virgin. I'm in some sort of weird thing with a 25 year old which I can't seem to get out of.

They both hate me. I'm so upset. I decided to stay at my nans, because I can't face them ganging up on me. They're so angry. 

I really don't know what to do. Will this ever blow over? I'd rather they forgot about it, and understood it was a one-time thing, and it will never happen again. But they won't forget. But I want them to. What should I do now?

EDIT: Details.

UPDATE: She found out about the phone bill. Now she wants to take the phone away. I can't handle not having a social life, I'll become so withdrawn. This is so much worse.

My boyfriend and I live together, both have full time jobs, and are also supporting his younger brother while he has an unpaid internship. Overall, we are doing pretty well for ourselves.


However, his father has been out of a job for the past two years, and his mother has been out of a job since Christmas. They have been looking desperately for something, to no avail, and now their unemployment is running out. His younger sister also can't find a job (though I can't speak for how thoroughly she is searching.)

We are considering trying to rent a house for them to stay with us for a year until they get a job. There are obviously SO many things wrong with this option, not to mention that there are literally no houses in the area that my boyfriend and I can afford. 


His parents and sister are currently living in an RV park, but even that is now too expensive. I offered us downgrading to a cheaper apartment and using the resulting extra money to help them out, but even that is only enough to pay basic rent (not even including food, gas for getting to interviews- there is NO public transit where they live). 


My mother thinks my boyfriend and I shouldn't be having to deal with this, but both sides of his extended family are psychopaths, so the only option here is us, and maybe welfare, though the welfare may not be approved in time for it to even matter. (oh, they also can't make money via blood donations, because they lived in a country with potentially unfiltered water for several years.)


I don't know what to do, the stress and anxiety this is causing has even caused me to miss a couple days of work. I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I honestly don't know what to do.

**Edit/Update:**

I'd like to thank everyone for their advice, all of the different perspectives have helped me think about this with a clearer mind. 


I know a lot of people have just told me to drop it and walk away, unfortunately I can't do that. I know I only said he was my boyfriend, but I suppose I should have pointed out that we have been together for a very long time, and are practically married (we just haven't had time for ceremony and such, and are not big on marriage anyway.) I suppose my wording made it sound like we weren't as close as that? That walking away from him and his family was an option at all? If I had said that he was my fiance, or my husband, would that have changed anyone's advice?


I'm going to email his mom directly, as when talking to my boyfriend, the only apparent option, to him, is to have them move in with us. We can't afford that, and I (and I know his mother agrees with me) don't think it will actually help them in the way he thinks it will. I'm going to ask them what kind of help they have searched for (welfare, stamps, etc.) and encourage them to take those routes while we can help them with any extra emergencies (car breaks down, need emergency gas for an interview, etc.) I'm also going to ask her to try and push her daughter harder in terms of getting a job, and will even offer to help find job postings close to where they live (I understand where her daughter is: just graduated high school. In the generation that has almost no clue how to do anything for themselves because her parents or older siblings did everything for her.) Hopefully, between his mother and I, we can convince him to look to alternate solutions that won't completely bankrupt us.

We weren't being disruptive just to be disruptive... I filmed the incident as a joke to use in a class project.

It was kind of a weird situation, but the idea was we would film the incident and the teacher would think we were just being bad students, but in reality we were just filming it as a joke to tie into a class presentation. A few weeks after the incident the teacher, along with the rest of the class, saw the video as part of my project.

At the time, I felt justified in disrupting the class because the teacher is a fairly easy-going guy and I was doing it as part of a presentation. However, over the past few months I have thought about the incident and decided it really wasn't a nice thing to do. I probably made my teacher feel like his class was a joke and that his students didn't respect him at all.

What makes me even more uncomfortable about this situation is the video of this incident has around a million views on YouTube. I do not know if my teacher has seen the video or not.

Last year, a company approached me about putting ads on the video and I agreed without thinking much of it. However, now that I have realized I did the wrong thing about the video, I feel very guilty about earning money from the video.

In a few months, the video will have made $100 and the company will make its first payment to me. I think the right thing to do would be to write a letter to the teacher explaining the situation, explaining my feelings, and apologizing for the incident. In the letter I would include a check for $100 dollars (the earnings from the video). As my teacher is the star of the video, I think it is appropriate for him to earn the money from the video. After I sent the letter, I would delete the video.

I do see some problems with this solution... I don't want this situation to blow up into a big deal, such as if he refuses the money or tries to get me into legal trouble (not very likely, knowing him, but it is a possibility).

So basically I'm looking for advice on this situation... should I just delete the video and try and forget about it? Or do you think I should bring up the situation with my old teacher and give him the earnings to try and correct me wrong? I think apologizing is the right thing to do. But apologizing could have some unintended consequences and it may be better just to let things drop.

I really want to be in dentistry and I find it really interesting, but I feel like I can't produce good enough grades to get into dental school. I lost alot of confidence in my ability in one science class where I studied from day one cause it was a retake class and I needed to do really well, but during the final I just bombed it and failed the class. From this I had to change majors and I was very devestated. I talked to professor and ta for help when I needed it and they were really surprised when I scored fairly low on the final because they felt like I understood the material. I lost alot of confidence after that semester.

I really wanna get into dental school and feel like that is my future, but I can't seem to get good enough grades for it. My motivation has been a bit shot after receiving dissapointing grades when I work fairly hard. I just don't get why I under perform on tests.

In person but I cannot feel this stress/anxiety for another day. I also want to give them the weekend to work

I kindly declined considering the situation.

I had a very long thing written, but I figured the list form would yield me better advice.

**MY SITUATION**

1) My dad used to abuse me and I am a broken individual as a result.

2) While living in that abusive environment and before I knew any better, there was were three isolated incidents at the age of around ~14 where I engaged in behaviors that put me in the role of the abuser myself. I am 25 now.

3) My mental state is deteriorating rapidly.

4) I am literally slipping into mental illness and experience what I can only describe as persistent tactile hallucinations.

5) I hate myself so much I can't even type it.

6) **MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL,** due to #2, I can never legally go to therapy and talk about this, ever, or I will get in legal trouble and have to register as a sex offender.

7) And now, the coup de grace which has sent me careening off a cliff: both of my brothers, as well as my mother, were floored to discover, last month, that my dad used to regularly beat the shit out of me. I always resented my mom for not sticking up for me, but she never knew because he never hit me around her (I never pieced that together). Furthermore, he apparently never laid a hand on my brothers, so he just picked me at random to abuse.

8) The effect of learning #7 is like a lifelong ""plot twist"" that I don't know how to recover from. The damage to my psyche from #7 has been extreme. I don't understand the big picture of my life anymore and I'm losing my grasp on normal everyday functioning as a result. I'm spiraling down into depression and don't know what to do.

**Summary**: I don't know what to do. I really need help, but because of #6, I can never get the help I need. I was coping before this by sort of drudging through each day, but now I'm losing my ability to do that. Some days I just sit inside the house and cry without leaving my house. I need help and I can't get it. I don't know what to do.

---------

EDIT: I'm going to elaborate on the above.

My dad abused me pretty regularly, as I said. The abuse was of an extremely violent, but nonsexual nature; he used to beat the shit out of me if he got angry. He always was careful not to leave bruises and never broke any bones, but pretty much up until that line he used to beat the shit out of me pretty good.

#2 on my list is what has caused me to become unraveled. I am now 25, so this was 11 years ago. In contrast with the abuse done to me, the abuse I did was of a nonviolent, sexual nature. The other person was between age 1-2 at the time and remembers nothing and wasn't hurt. If this disgusts you, then it fucking disgusts me too, now that I'm an adult with a working brain and I understand the entire situation and know how to separate ""abuse"" from ""normal stuff.""

Since that day in college when I first contemplated my childhood with a clear head, and recognized the situation for what it was, I have been slipping slowly but surely further into depression and madness. I had been abused, I hadn't even realized it, and, to put the cherry on top, I had repeated the cycle of abuse without realizing that I was abusing or that ""abuse"" was involved in any capacity. I felt sorry for myself after realizing I was abused for about 3 seconds, until I realized I had also done abusive things; then my self-pity was replaced by nothing but utter hatred for myself and self-loathing. I have since since contemplated suicide many, many times. 

I mean the following statement literally: the thought of contemplating suicide for the first time did something fucked up to my mind and created, upon thinking about it, this very strange tactile ""crawling"" or ""hole"" or ""pressure"" feeling in my head that's hard to explain and has never gone away. Again, I mean that literally: something has clearly snapped in my brain and I am worrying that I'm becoming schizophrenic. Every day this weird feeling is there and it's slowly but surely fucking more and more with my concentration and ability to function. In the 8 years since, that feeling has never gone away.

I can't handle it anymore. I don't know how to. I am dead inside every day. And, because of #2 on this list, where I acted out abuse myself while living in the abusive environment, I will never get sympathy from anyone. I'm no longer a victim but now I'm the bad guy, even if I was 14 at the time. I can never tell anyone, or else they will hate me. Furthermore, people already hate me; they just don't know it because they don't know what happened, and the parents of the child involved hate me more than anyone, though they don't realize it. I will never be able to get close enough to anyone to trust them with this information. The fact that I was abused for ~18 years now means nothing because of my three incidents when I was 14.

I clearly am developing a serious mental illness and need to go to therapy. But, because I abused someone 11 years ago, despite being in a situation where I was a teenager being abused myself and didn't know any better, the therapist is legally mandated to report me. If you don't believe me, look it up. This is despite that I was in an abusive situation myself, literally didn't know ""right"" from ""wrong"" at the time, was underage, and have no desire to do anything like that again; the law is that the therapist must report me. Thus, I can never discuss this topic in therapy or I will become a sex offender, and since the whole point of therapy is to get me to open up about my experiences, there is no point of therapy for me. My Mom knows about this and wants me to just ""figure it out."" I can't figure it out and I'm losing my grip on reality.

Since learning about #7, I'm losing it. I can no longer function. It's hard to communicate just how fucked up that makes me feel. I don't know why I was singled out to be abused and I always hated my mom for not sticking up for me. Now I feel sick. I can't cope anymore. I need to go to therapy and talk about all of this, but because I, while in the abusive environment, had an incident where I abused myself, I can't or I'll have to register as a sex offender, despite not having any desire to abuse anyone or do anything like that at all now that I'm an adult who's out of the situation and can see it clearly.

In short, I'm losing my grip on reality. I don't know what to do. I can tell I'm headed for some kind of meltdown and I'm desperately trying to keep my grip on life. I need to talk to someone about this, anyone. I need to figure out how to make fucking sense of anything at all in my life. But, I can never go to therapy and discuss this subject, because of the law.

Please give me advice. I don't know what to do. I need to find a way to go to therapy and not go to jail. If that's not possible then my situation is hopeless.

**PS:** if your response is going to be something like FUCK YOU because of #2, then fuck you. Really, I'm crying as I type this. I didn't know what I was doing and wish I never did it and I don't want to ever do anything like that again. I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do anymore.

**SECOND EDIT:** I appreciate the encouragement, but just want to add that I really am serious when I say the law is set up to fuck me over if I ever disclose this in therapy. I wasn't just saying that because I was depressed, but rather my depression reached new lows when I researched the subject and found that it was true. The laws I'm talking about have been met with criticism before, specifically because they fuck people in my situation over, so I'm not just making it up; [I wrote a comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1a7j14/i_feel_like_my_mental_state_is_spiraling_out_of/c8vn0w2) with the details.

Most people, myself included, support the laws as applied to actual adult pedophile sex offenders who don't care if they fuck over children. And, furthermore, there's also widespread criticism about the concept of a 14 year old kid, especially one who was abused and getting the shit kicked out of him regularly and didn't know right from wrong at the time, having to register as a sex offender for life and being lumped in with the first group.  Since the law is *so* broad in that respect, the law has spawned a wave of ""gray area"" legal cases similar to mine, and I expect the juvenile sex offender registry sections will probably be overturned eventually as the courts work their way through it, maybe like 10 years from now.

The laws I'm talking about are real; they're brand new, ""tough love"" laws enacted in the wake of things like the Catholic Church scandals and stuff like that. You know how you hear stories about some 15 year old kid who ends up on the sex offender list for life because his GF sent him a text with a pic of her boobs or something, and he get busted for child porn? That shit is real, and that's even dumber than my situation; it's the result of the same laws that I'm talking about. Society is still figuring it out.

I'm sorry to make this so so fucking sad, but my situation is real. I wish I could somehow just calmly discuss this but I'm at my wit's end here. I'm literally losing my mind every week, and I don't know what to do and I don't know if I can just keep going through life indefinitely until society one day comes up with a better system for treating abused kids who unwittingly did stupid things while they were also still kids. So I mean it: I really am fucked. I did something stupid at 14 when I was getting the shit beaten out of me every week and didn't know any better, and at that point society decided I was irrevocably broken and no longer gives a shit about me. I'm not making that up. I clearly need help, but I am not allowed to get the help I need because of that judgment from society, and I don't know what to do.

She relocated as quick as possible to a new neighborhood, but less than a week there she was mugged at gunpoint.

Music that they enjoy listening to and that ""speaks"" to them or that they ""connect with,"" and songs and artists and albums and genres that mean a lot to them and that they're passionate about.

I don't. I've always tried, but no music I've ever heard means anything more to me than the ""that sounds cool"" factor. First of all, I have troubles understanding the lyrics or what the music's about; what emotions it's trying to convey and what it's trying to say. Even if someone sends me a link to a song with a 3-paragraph explanation of what every single line is saying, I can listen to the song intently and not get how on earth they got that meaning from it. It doesn't make any sense.

Second, even if I do understand the meaning behind the music, I couldn't care less. It doesn't mean anything to me, I really don't care at all, it's stupid and useless to me. I don't like feeling this way. I want to care; I want to enjoy music.

Most people use music as an emotional outlet. They use it to express themselves or to help them through tough times or to lift their spirits or to make them feel good. When *I* listen to music, I get simultaneously depressed (sometimes suicidal) and pissed off. I feel like by the end of the song I'm either going to put a bullet through my brain or punch the crap out of my monitor until my knuckles are bleeding and broken. It's not fair.

It's so frustrating, because I try so hard to understand and like music, and I've asked so many different people for music suggestions and I've listened to musics of all different genres, artists, etc. None of it works.

Honestly, it's probably because I'm just naturally not a passionate person. There are very few or no things I'm actually passionate about. Usually I just don't really care near as much as most others do. I can usually work around that and not let it get to me, but when it comes to music, this is *literally* ruining my life, at least on an emotional level. I'm getting closer and closer to a complete mental breakdown, because it weighs on me more and more every day.

Why can't I enjoy music at all? What's wrong with me? I mean, I was even in orchestra from 6th-9th grade, and was 1st chair viola all of those years (and 1st chair cello in 8th grade when I took a second orchestra class).

this story is a little complicated. I'm not asking for advice for myself, but for a girl I'm seeing, because she's no good at seeking help herself.

Background: I'[m] 24, European student on exchange in an Asian city. In a week I'm going back home to my country. She's 26, also a European, currently working here and will do so until going to her home country in July. After meeting each other a few months ago and things progressing, we've been in a pretty intense relationship the last few weeks. THE RELATIONSHIP IS FINE. What I'm asking advice for is something that's happened to her three times, and which is starting to worry me. The connection between the seizures seems to be lack of sleep and physical exhaustion through sex (the first two times) or alcohol (the last time). 

Let's call her Sarah. During the last few weeks, Sarah has had three seizures which seem to be both of a mental and physical nature. 

This is what happens:

- First, she gets really tired. She goes from being mildly drowsy or sleepy to completely limp. It comes with a warning, as she says ""I feel so tired..."", sometimes repeatedly, and then just slumps together wherever she is. She will literally not be able to stand up. The second seizure happened after sex in the bathroom, and I had to hold her up and carry her to bed. It's as if she's passed out drunk, she makes no effort to keep herself up, all she can do is roll around and maybe grab a blanket to cover herself. If she rolls on the edge of the bed, she will fall off, which happened during the third seizure. I've tried slapping her hard in the face to ""wake"" her up. No response. The only thing that got her to react was when I poured cold water in her face. Even that only momentarily ""woke"" her up.

- She gets upset. Really upset. It's as if she's living through a bad dream while still awake. Well, I say awake, but communicating with her is hard. She barely responds. It's sort of like talking to a person who's talking in their sleep, the answers are incoherent. At the same time, she'll call my name in a pretty desperate voice when I'm not in the room, but when I'm there, she can forget what my name was. During the first seizure she started sobbing, saying ""I'm so sorry...I'm not a good person!"" She kept repeating this. During the third seizure, she started crying, saying ""I don't want you to leave!"" I misspoke, and said ""I don't know"" instead of ""I know, I know"", which led her to bawl and repeat ""You don't know, you don't know...."" During the second seizure, she was not so upset, just seemingly in a very intoxicated state, like really high.

- This is the scariest part: The seizure makes her black out. When she returns to her normal state, she has no memory of what just happened. She'll ask me ""What happened?"", and when I tell her, she gives me this incredulous stare. After the third seizure, she was (understandably) very upset, apologising for ""scaring me"".

This all lasts between 10 minutes and half an hour. I've found myself surprisingly calm when it's happened, carried her to bed, held her, talked to her, tried to get her to snap out of it. But soon I'll be gone, and I fear that she will have these episodes happen to her increasingly. So I come here to ask for advice. Yes, I know, go see a doctor, go see a therapist. I've told her this. The problem is that she doesn't have the money for that, and affordable mental health care in this Asian city is scarce. She doesn't really have any very good friends she wants to talk about it with, either, and her family members are either too young, too unstable or too troubled themselves already. Her approach to it is to deal with it on her own. Well, I've gone through some (medium) mental problems myself, and I know that trying to deal with shit alone is stupid. 

A few things about her that might help you gain insight about her psychology:

- She often puts blame on herself and feels she should do more for people, in particular her family. She's not an altruist, but she does seem to have this constant small feeling of guilt. 

- She grew up in a poor suburban place, and always had to do things herself. She's very independent. 

- She's very smart and creative. She's studied law, and she's a very good drawer.

- She is often sad about me leaving. She is very fond of me. I am very fond of her too, but I guess I'm more prepared to leave than she is. I've already bought ticket to see her in Europe in July. In the meanwhile, we're breaking up when I leave. I'm not doing a long distance relationship, for selfish reasons.

I would be thankful for any kind of response, even a layman's diagnosis of what could be going on. Do you recognise any symptoms? Is this purely a mental thing, or could there be something wrong with her physically?

I can tell she isn't lying for attention because of her eyes... You can see the hurt and the haunted look in them, and I was bullied too. She's lost her self-confidence over the last while... Her only escape is downstairs playing Minecraft.

She brought it up while she was doing math today. The same as usual but a person she thought was her friend said the comment about her being a freak... And she was told by the same person that ""she isn't allowed to play with me anymore because her mom said so"" according to my sister. She is wanting to switch schools because it's so bad.

My sister and I have a plan to speak with my father about it, who is more likely to do shit about it... My mom talked to her teacher and it didn't help.

I seriously have no idea what to do, Reddit. I'm seventeen so I really have no say in schooling. I told her to ""do her best at ignoring it but you can't respond to it...

Now, the chin can be fixed, but not so much for the mid-face. I have braces now, so my teeth aren't messed up anymore, but the jaw stuff is a little late.

See, I'm female, so this is not good. Ever since puberty started I've been called all kinds of names and have been bullied so much. I've been bullied a lot for looking like a man. I once even heard two adults whispering about it. Some have said I look like Cher (and not in the good way). Boys go after my friends, but somehow never go for me.

I can't stand mirrors or pictures. Sometimes I notice that even before I know someone they gave me kind of strange smug sneer, like as if they think I'm stupid, even when I'm in a place like an advanced/AP class.  I'm pretty sure it's because of my appearance, because usually after people hear me talk they stop giving me the look and realize that I'm more intelligent than I look. I hate it. I hate having to prove myself. I hate being so invisible. No one likes looking at things that are disproportionate.

I make sure to keep myself very clean and dressed. Make-up however is tricky for me. .Even when I use it lightly, or even just use some mascara, I feel that I look like a man trying to be a girl. I've been losing weight to improve my figure (not overweight but I have room for improvement), but now my face looks even more masculine and long.

My speech is affected by this jaw problem, and I have very poor social skills. I've talked to my parents about this, and they have been of almost no help. They accused me of being shallow and would say canned responses like ""You're beautiful you just don't see it."" and ""Beauty is only in the eye of the beholder"" ""No one is perfect."" I show them how my face deviates strongly from most people's proportions, and they deny it. My jaw has sharp angles, yet my mom insists that I have a round feminine jaw. Goddamnit.

What makes this so much worse is that I was a really good-looking child. A lot of people say that, but I think it is most likely very true. I've seen pictures of myself as a young child, and not to be too narcissistic, I think so. When I would walk with my mom, sometimes people would stop and say ""You have such a beautiful daughter."" My parents love reminding me of this to convince that I'm somehow still beautiful. I hate that they don't see it. They want me to avoid any surgeries that are purely for aesthetic reasons, because ""everyone has flaws."" Yeah, whatever. I don't want to be perfect, I just want to be normal.


Sorry for ranting a little up there. Onto my question. I still have a while until I get corrective jaw surgery, which will (hopefully) fix some of the issues.

A little background on me:

About me!
- I am a male in my mid-early 20s. 
- I live in Western Canada.
- I am shy.

Education!
- I did not do well in high school, and just spent the last 3 years or so in a post-secondary institution studying something I truly do not like (accounting). I have a diploma in accounting.
- A lot of the courses I took are transferable to other institutions.
- As soon as I realized how much I did not want to be an accountant, I took the JVIS career test thing, and the results are very heavily weighed in the skilled trades and machinist/mechanical occupations.
- I quite enjoy working with my hands, and coming up with solutions to problems, in the physical sense of things (like, I like to think of ways to make a better product, or how something is made)
- Thankfully, I have almost no student loan debt. It will all be paid off within a year, probably sooner.

Jerbs!
- Currently, I am working a low-paying dead-end retail job. I do not enjoy this job. I am looking into exploring career options, namely actually a career and not just a job. Prior to this, I worked in computer repair. I have no problems with computer stuff (hardware, at least).
- Seeing as how I work in retail, the hours are all over the place. I could be opening one morning (9-5), and then closing the day after (closing at 10 or 11), and then have a day off, a mid-day shift, then two days off. Retail hours, basically.

Home life and interests!
- I am not suicidal and have no plans of self-harm. I went through a phase of being majorly depressed many years ago, and it is not somewhere I am, or would like to be again.
- I live at home, and my parents are very supportive of anything I choose to do. Which is amazing. The parents have helped me out with tuition before, and have no problem doing so again. Something I am very thankful for every day.
- I don't really do that much these days except for go to work, and then internet for a few hours before going to bed, and repeating the cycle. In the spare time I do have, I don't really have that many interests anymore. Video games aren't interesting to me anymore, and I don't really have any IRL hobbies. 
- Since I graduated from high school (more than 5 and less than 10 years ago), I've lost contact with basically everyone, except my very best friend whom I have known for more than 3/4 of my life. Short of that, it's mostly internet friends I talk to almost all of the time. To put it into perspective, I have maybe 40 facebook friends, I haven't posted anything there since February 2011, and don't use the chat feature or anything. I would say I have maybe 3 IRL friends. 
- I also enjoy graphics and design. I love seeing how things all fit together and how they're made. 

So, what I would like advice on, wonderful people of needadvice

- Careers and jerbs: 
I'm still having trouble deciding on what I want to do. There are a few things I'm interested in, namely being a machinist. The difficult part is that it seems like to get anywhere, you need to study at a post secondary as an apprentice, and to do that you need to have a company sponsor you as an apprentice, and to do that you need to work for said company, but to work for any company, you already need to be an apprentice. 
I'm also not sure about my existing job. I'm only really there for the (frankly insulting) paycheck, and because I don't want to just be staying at home not doing anything until school comes around. 

- Hobbies
It really feels like on weekends I don't have to work, that I just sit around and use the computer from when I wake up until I sleep, but without doing anything productive or being particularly entertained. I would love to have some non-computer-based hobbies

- Friends
It feels like I don't really have any friends that I can hang out with and just have a fun time with. Most of the time, I talk to people online, which isn't really the same as human contact.

I'm not sure what the fuck happened, but it has become the worst place/industry to work in.

* Our once-reasonable performance-targets have been replaced by moving goal posts.  I'm a great performer, but up until some recent changes were made it always seems as all employees are a *little* bit below the performance targets.  They've used this as leverage to justify static salaries.

* Senior management that has decided to micromanage our work habits.  This is one of the worst things that has happened.  They no longer treat the employees like adults, and question every little thing you do on the job, regardless of how insignificant it is.

* They're reducing our skillsets, ie. they're severely restricted the types of transactions we were able to perform.  This has made my job a lot more difficult, and gives me a lot less to put on my resume (they claim that it's being done in the interest of ""efficiency"")

* My pay has stagnated while my work hours have been on the rise.  Every time I come home I'm exhausted, stressed out, and I don't even feel like fucking my wife.  It's not that I'm no longer attracted to her- I definitely am. I just become a lump of flesh who wants to take off the monkey suit, eat, then fall asleep because I just put up with a bunch of insanity for 12 hours.  I've been trying to study Software Development on my own, but the new demands of the job really don't allow much time for this.

* Nepotism has been on the rise, and they no longer try to hide it.  I was recently passed up on a promotion because one of the boss' pals from outside of the company wanted it. This isn't the first time, and a lot of people have left the company because of the lack of advancement opportunities.

* There has also been a huge amount of turnover- I don't think I've had a Manager for longer than ~2 months before they decided to leave or seek a different position.

The thing is, this isn't the first time I've run into this issue.  Every bank I've worked at seems to follow the same trajectory- things start out great, they get worse, then they're shit. Quite frankly- I want out.

Here's the problem: I have a mortgage to pay.  I really want to move into Software Development, but I can't afford to not work.  My wife and I also have plans to move into a bigger house, since we've wanted a baby for a while.  Any reputable program I've seen is a 3-4 year full-time program.

So, any insight into any reading material for me, to understand her situation better would be greatly appreciated.

Keeping a long story as short as possible:

A good friend of mine for 10+ years finally falls hopelessly in love with a guy (she's 26 at the time, he's 30) and not 9 months into the relationship, he's diagnosed with a very serious cancer.  She Mother Teresa'ed the dude as she took upon herself the role of his sole caretaker.  He came from a crazy hillbilly family, so my friend had very little to no support from anyone.  About 6 months later he passes away, as expected but he does so in a very graceful manner.

I had a very great respect for what she did; it made the awesome person I knew her to be seem like a superhero bad bitch that could handle anything life could ever throw at her.  But this was not to be the case.

Since his death (now 1 month and a week ago) she's gone fully manic.  She speaks without making hardly any sense, is quick become defensive and snaps on everybody she knows, happens to meet or any random hapless random fuck walking down the street.  She's now incredibly narcissistic to an extreme I didn't even know could exist until now.  She's completely self absorbed and has absolutely no time for anyone's thoughts, feelings or expressions.  She's butchering all of her longtime friendships one after the other and burning every bridge she has.  And she's not getting any better, only worse.

I honestly can not tell if she is deliberately attempting to destroy her life or if this is a mental health issue.  Matters have become serious as she has now found herself in various legal issues.  The person she is today runs completely counter to the person I've known for the past 10+ years and I'm scared shitless for her.  Ours was the first relationship she destroyed and I've had all our mutual friends call me one by one explaining that she's done the same thing to them.  I tried to take her in her and try to support her so that she could grieve, get back on her feet and then be her bad self I knew her to be.  But my support I provided only seemed to enable her mental state to degrade.  Now she's working on fucking over her B grade relationships and making a fine showing at it too.

What the hell could cause this behavior?  No doubt, drugs are involved somewhere in the equation, but it seems like a deep rooted psychological disorder has taken a hold of her.

For some reason I fail socially almost all the time, and it has become intertwined with my depression. I have old friends whom I still can be with and that for some reason appreciate my company but new friends in school and work. It just won't work.

The problem is that I consider myself to be very smart. I have always had it easy in school, best grades, etc. I just know many things that are often usable. And I always consider myself to be right. I have been ""rewarded"" for my ""smartness"" which has made me the person I am. A bit of a besserwisser (even though I try to keep it down).

I have very bad self-esteem and confidence and lately the only thing that I have been able to get some boost of is my ""smartness"". Not the best thing to make friends I suppose.

But, I don't know how to get rid of it. It's such a big part of my self-image even though I know that I'm far from very smart. But it's the only personality trait I've got...

Question about my new housemate and her pet.,21,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/10kmys/am_i_in_the_wrong_here_question_about_my_new/,"We all just moved into a house together, and the one girl (the rest of us are guys) brought her cat.  I had no idea she was bringing a cat, but that's fine, whatever.  Seems like a cool cat.

She couldn't find it this morning, and called me at work freaking out, thinking it may have climbed out my window.  After assuring her my window was closed, she said something like, ""good.  You need to be fucking careful.  It will go out and not come back.""

And to myself, I thought...what the heck?  I was never asked to keep my window closed, and this is not my cat.  I don't mind keeping my window closed, that is not the issue, the issue is that she approached it terribly.  In my mind, the right way would be to call me and say something like, ""I can't find my cat.  I'd like to all help to take care of my cat and make sure he stays inside.  Would you mind keeping your window closed?""

I honestly feel like if she's that worried, she should be keeping *her* cat in *her* room, instead of letting it wander around then getting angry at the housemates.

Before I confront her, I wanted to make sure I have grounds to.  I basically want to tell her I don't mind helping out in any way I can, but cursing me out and telling me what to do in regards to her cat isn't going to fly with me.  I also need to check myself because I've already started to dislike her because she seems a bit dramatic and annoying, so I don't want to come at this from a subjective angle.  But I do want to handle the way she handled this.

Any input would be appreciated, thank you!

**UPDATE:**  Thanks for your input, guys.  It was all helpful.  I made a mistake in leaving out a huge detail - that I don't have a bedroom door yet.  The landlord isn't putting it on until this weekend.  After that, I'll be closing it/locking it every time I leave.  

After a few hours, I got a clear head about me, and called her back.  I told her I do not mind if she needs me to pitch in on something, but that I felt accused and blindsided with the way she called and freaked out a bit.  I told her I understand she was probably just scared about her cat, but I didn't appreciate the way it was handled.  She apologized, eventually found her cat, and things seem to be Ok between us.

(  Wall of text :/  I'll try to keep it brief   )

I work at a job where I run digital presses all day printing advertisements. I get paid 12 dollars an hour with opportunity for overtime. I try to remind myself everyday that I am lucky to have a job, health insurance and vacation time. Truth is, aside from my relationships with coworkers, I hate everything about it. I am an introverted creative type and this mindless advertising is the opposite of all I believe in. I cooked in restaurants since I was 15 before that, I enjoyed it but the work was grueling and the pay sucked. 

My mom took the liberty to open some utilities in my name, she went to jail and they went unpaid unbeknownst to me. She is now on probation for quite a while, if I blow the whistle she will go to jail for a long time. I love her to death TBH and I could never do this to her. She is bipolar and probably schizophrenic so I understand she isn't in control, but she refuses to be treated because of said conditions. 

I make enough to pay my bills and have a little spending money. I live in a rundown 200 year old carriage barn that is renovated poorly, but is secluded and I have no neighbors. It's $550 per month if you don't count the natural gas for heat (New England winters). My roommate is a lazy, alcoholic whore that aside from being a total shithead is easy to get enough along with. I have a fiance in college for the next three years an hour away going for an art degree. 

I got good grades in school and planned on going to college for video game design. That went out the window when my dad bailed on me when I was 16, my mom was in and out of jail. I really had no other family besides my Ex-stepdad that was an abusive asshole. Thankfully he fed me and kept a roof over my head. I started working the day it was legal to have a part time job and I have been supporting myself ever since. College really wasn't an option at the time. 

I need a change but I don't want to lose my stability I have barely scraped together over the past few years. 

I know I will be fine, but I really could use some advice.

Thanks guys

**UPDATE**

I know it hasn't been long but I have been busy taking care of a few things. You all took the time to give me your advice and I figured I owed you this. 

A very good friend and ex-coworker of mine just came into a great opportunity to open a new restaurant. He knew about my prior experience and needs someone with my abilities. I will be making more money and get decent benefits (for a restaurant). I have a secured credit card that was just recently opened and I will safely use that to start establishing credit. I talked to my roommate about being shitty and he agreed and is helping out more around the house. My neighbors are being evicted witch leads an opening for my roommate and I to perhaps get a great deal on that part of the property and basically move 10 feet into a beautiful farm house. 

Things are really looking up so far. I'll keep on pushing forward!

I'm sitting here at home, it's 3am and I can't sleep because, not for the first time, I feel like I might be losing my mind. 

I can't talk to anybody about this but I crave external input. I don't know really know how to articulate it but I'm going to try my best here. I feel like there is something fundamentally wrong with me, the best way to describe it is intense mood swings. My entire life perspective can and often does change from day to day or sometimes by the hour, I can't tell if it's external factors that trigger these changes or if it's just me, I don't know if it's normal and I'm just being hypocondriac or if I'm legitimately nuts. 

Often I'm angry or sad, but that sounds very black and white as opposed to how I really feel. There's all kinds of different sad and I can be angry in a dozen different ways. Sometimes I feel like I just want to flare out and quit my job, in fact I even look for excuses to do so, I feel like I'm being wronged, they don't appreciate me, my bosses are idiots, a feeling many of you can relate to I'm sure the problem is when I'm thinking this way it's a very dangerous possibility. All it would take is a trigger and I'd be off, sometimes I even get violent impulses, like if somebody were to raise their voice to me my first impulse is to snap. It's a caveman reaction but it's seems completely reasonable at the time.

 This feeling can persist for days or weeks and then it will fade, I might be calm one hour of the day, totally zen and then an hour later I'm almost euphoric, I tend to be goofy and I have a hard time keeping myself composed, most often I'm sad, it could be like a dull ache and I'll find myself daydreaming a lot or a crippling misery that makes me terribly insecure and I have a hard time interacting with people. 

More often than not, I have a hard time maintaning conversations with people, I find it exhausting, it will start out fine but after a few minutes I just get absorbed back into my own thoughts or I just lose interest, it can make me seem stand offish or awkward. Yet other times, and it could be with the same people as before about similar topics and I feel totally engaged, confident and alert, other times I'm too into it and I feel like I might be talking too much. I can't focus on any long term goals because I'll make plans one day and the very next I'll be completely uninterested, it could be because I'm feeling blue and can't see the point or it could be that I feel great and so why hit the gym when I like who I am right now perfectly fine? I keep telling myself that I just need discipline, but I could be something for weeks that I actually enjoy and then suddenly I just don't. I can't maintain the same level of a relationship for very long, I find after a time I distance myself from friends after a certain point. 

Girls are an even bigger problem. I sometimes get paranoid and I feel like people are screwing me behind my back. I'm in a relationship right now and I often feel like she's not telling me something or I pick up on ""clues"" like body language or she'll mention a guy friend and red flags go off in my head and I create all these scenarios with circumstancial evidence where she's cheating on me, I don't ever bring these thoughts to light because an hour or a day later I look at it from entirely new perspective and I see it for the paranoia it is and I think, wow, how crazy am I?

And then I'll be fine, not always happy but I'll feel unstressed and focused. But then I'll get this sour feeling like I've done something wrong, I can't really say what, I just feel like I'm acting wrong or different, or I'll blow something trivial into something huge and beat myself up over it, I get this feeling of guilt that just stays for what seems like forever. This leads to me becoming irritatable or depressed, which launches me right back into the rollercoaster of highs and lows that leave me feeling like I'm going to meltdown. I haven't been able to stay at one place for very long or hang with the same group for too long because eventually I'll have an episode where all this stress builds up and I do something stupid, like say fuck it and quit my job, or get into a fistfight with my roommate or try to OD on morphine and up in the hospital. I have a bag of clothes and a laptop to my name because I'm just terrible at holding on to anything.

I turned to drugs for a time to help, (I'm 5 months clean atm) first I started taking Adderall which seemed to level me out, I didn't get ""up"" on them but instead I felt calm and level. I never took more than 30 mgs at a time, and used just that daily. My moods didn't switch off and on so rapidly, is it possible that I have ADHD? Or was I just high? The only downside is it made me feel like a zombie, I never seemed to hit my social phase or really have a good laugh from the gut while I was on them, if that makes sense. Eventually I ran out so I turned to opiates, which only made the mood swings worse but mostly I felt great on them, this eventually led to a heroin addiction which resulted in why I'm clean today. 

I've wondered many times if I'm bi polar (my father is diagnosed bipolar) but I've read up a lot about it and the ""cycles"" don't seem to fit. I've talked to doctors before but not never followed up treatment nor got a diagnosis (except for depression at 16, which I was prescribed Prozac which I stopped taking about a year after being put on)

Is this normal? Could be it be one thing that's fucking me up like a chemical imbalance or are there multiple issues? I can't afford to see a doctor, I live on my own and have no family support. Can anybody relate to any of this?

TL:DR Can a person know if they're losing their mind?

http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wtsdp/whats_the_best_way_to_get_my_coworker_to_stop/

I thought I’d give everyone who helped out an update.  The general consensus in the original thread seemed to be to let Tim know when he’d interrupted someone, and then turn my attention toward the person speaking.

I tried that a few times, and others in the group did it as well (if he interrupted me, someone else might say “let the_slutty_pumpkin finish”).  Ultimately, Tim did not get the message.  As lunch continued to turn into the “listen to Tim talk” hour, I started doing other things on my lunches.  Going for walks, going for coffee, running an errand, and inviting along just a member or two of the group.  Eventually Tim was left eating lunches alone for a bit, actually.

Today I decided I’d eat with the group and try to get everyone to eat together.  Tim interrupted me, and I snapped a bit.  I said in front of the group that the way he behaves is disrespectful and it makes people not want to eat lunch with him.  He kind of made a joke, said “I feel bad”, and I just left.  This was probably not the best way to handle it.  I’m not sure if I made myself look worse or not, but I don’t really care.  This was the last resort for me after dropping hints, suggesting politely he not interrupt, and spending a week or two of lunches on my own in hopes of getting over it, but I just couldn’t shake it when he talked over me and cut me off *again*.

I’m not sure if I will eat lunch with the group again, I honestly would rather eat by myself than have my conversations dominated like that.

Either way, thanks very much to /r/needadvice for all the input and suggestions on the matter.

Me: Try wiping maybe?
Guy X: Great thanks!

Guy X: Hey I did what you said and now I have poop all over my hand.
Me: Are you joking? Is there a hidden camera here?
Guy X: So I have poop everywhere. How do I clean it up.
Me: Why didn't you use toilet paper?
Guy X: What paper?
Me: You know the stuff you use to wipe your ass with. Every day. Every time you poop. You know poop. What your hands are now covered in. The reason I'll never eat anything you bring to the pot luck again. 
Guy X: Oh. Yeah I forgot. Does that matter? 
Me: Nah you're good. Take it easy. 
-15 minutes goes by- 
Guy X: Seriously what do I do. I'm not sure.
Me: explains in detail making sure not to leave any minor detail out. 
Guy X walks past me the next day. He just exited the bathroom and his hands are still covered in poop.

All joking aside this is what I deal with on a daily basis. I work in a  field were there are absolute answers and logic dictates action. People seek me out for information because I know how to communicate information effectively (at least I think so and have been told so), I usually provide an adequate answer, and  I can back up my thoughts with data to support any argument I present. The trouble is that the knowledge that I provide I feel is wasted on those that are lazy. People have stopped coming and asking me complex issue and have started using me in place of google with zero attempt at thinking for themselves. People aren't retaining this information either. I could have a conversation with someone. Record the conversation and play it back to them the next day/week and they would act like it never happened. Dont get my wrong. I enjoy being an authority on the topics these people bring to me, but i just wish that they would attempt to learn rather than be lazy. 

I used to just get annoyed and be in a bad mood. I'd go home in a bad mood, wake up in a bad mood, be snippy with my wife, or just be angry. Usually this would be the result of getting home and having to make decisions as well. Not that those were my wife being stupid, just average what do you want to do this weekend, what do you want to eat, lets work on our budget, and so on kinda things. But still I get worked up because I'm just so infuriated by work.

Currently someone will come to me and ask for help. I'll usually get snippy with them and ask them what they did to look it up. Usually nothing. This is also followed with my asking them what they want to do or think. At this point almost regardless of the answer I tell them that what they want to do is correct and send them on their way. I've stopped trying to teach them how to use logic, stopped having drawn out conversations about rationale because its wasted. 

As a result I feel that 99% of what I do is also a waste because the actions these people are taking are seen as status quo. This further infuriates me because I'm not in a position to ""change the world"" so to speak, and have to be content with how our small operation is run.

Basically, there aren’t many young guys here, but the five of us who are younger (I’m 26) began eating lunch together every day, and we all get along well.

Cue Tim.

Lately, I have noticed that Tim speaks very loudly and confidently in the middle of other people’s sentences.  Someone will get a few words out and Tim will interject with either his own thoughts/stories/opinions.  It’s incredibly rude and interrupts the flow of conversation within the group.  I don’t know if it bugs the other guys, but it sure as hell bugs me.  If I’m the one speaking, usually I just continue to speak until he shuts his mouth, but even that is beginning to fail.  

Little background on Tim:  he’s severly overweight with not many friends.  He often complains about his life, and I know he does nothing but play video games.  I’m confused as to why this guy controls the conversation and why people in the group seem to respect his opinion so much.

My goal here is for everyone in the group to be able to speak, share, talk, etc. without fear of being interrupted and buried under Tim's constant commentary.  I'd like us all to be able to contribute to conversation equally, so we can all enjoy our lunch hour to the fullest.

What would you do?  I know it’s in my bounds to ask him to not interrupt me when I’m speaking, but what I’d really like to tell him is that it’s disrespectful and basic social etiquette to not interrupt *anyone’s* speaking.    I feel like this is pretty basic stuff.  Should I call him out in front of the group, talk to him privately, or decide to eat lunch elsewhere?

I'm a good student, I like to learn things and do that well. I've managed to keep my life in place up until now, but it's getting harder. 

The reason is: I'm way, waaay to lazy to make anything work in the long run. Sure, I can get work done in all of my classes and finish them with good grades, but I'm always doing everything in the last possible moment and, for that reason, always just learning a fraction of what I could. I can't stop myself from doing nothing on the internet.

It gets even worse with respect to objectives that don't have a deadline, like exercise. I can find some impulse, but soon after it shrinks to nothing.This seems to be the main problem: Almost all impulses that I have to do something are way too weak, and last one or two minutes, sometimes maybe even an hour or two, but then it goes away (maybe destroyed by my inner cynicism at a subconscious level)

Like I've said: I've managed to get things working well up to this point, but things are getting harder and harder and I always feel guilty about the things I'm loosing because I can't manage to do stuff.

The question is, how can you change that endless cycle of laziness, guilt and despair?

I'm sure there are interpretations about why it happens (maybe it's because I've never had to struggle with anything?) but up until now that haven't helped me at all. 

I'm posting here because I'm quite sure that to some level what I'm saying here is a common problem on the people on internet (maybe of all my generation as well?)

Anyway, all I care is, how do you change that? I'm sure it's all about my attitude, but some concrete tips on how to change it would be awesome. Thanks for the attention.

I would get beaten for many things. Grades not good enough in school. My social behaviour was unacceptable to them. I didn't help with household chores. I couldn't memorise all the multiplication tables. Just about anything they disagreed with. And today, I don't have any good memories of me and my parents.

And they were so conservative that in the past 19 years they have never ever talked about anything even remotely related to sex to me.

I decided that something needed to change so I took a week of work experience in France and then forced myself into planning a month long expedition to Tanzania. Somehow I managed to get through the year of training (I'd never camped before) and completed the trip without being a burden - which was my personal target. I managed self respect, confidence, and I learnt to feel no shame for who I am (the only thing to stick). Then things gradually fall apart: I watched my apathy kill a relationship and friendship, despite high expectations I failed my college IB diploma, and finally decided I needed another big push - so I wrangled my way into a University abroad, in Canada.


---


All that I've managed to do in those 6 months since I arrived is adapt around my new life to return to the laziest existence I can get away with:

* I have gained and kept only three friends, though I am partially accepted into the social circle of one of them. If I am not in regular unavoidable contact, I cannot keep friends as I just contentedly do my own thing alone.

* I've always been extremely solitary (I was lucky and got myself a single room), but I'm reaching the point where walking 10 steps down the hallway to the shower takes minutes of patiently waiting and praying to not be seen, followed by a mad dash. I am very content to be alone most of the time, but I'm frankly getting very lonely. It's not as if I am socially incompetent, I just don't care.

* I've tried to gain hobbies or join clubs, but it never seems to work out even if I am enjoying myself. I tried reading, writing, drawing and such (not big on sports) but they all died eventually. I've given up on all but one club, too. The moment a potentially awkward moment or a reason to not work on them appears, the whole thing crashes to a halt - this could be a time frame of a few days or a few months, but it is always inevitable.

* The result of this is that I do not spend my free time doing anything but being content. I understand that even gaming is a hobby, but like reading before it I have just found myself with more free time and yet less will to play. I just browse Reddit, read webcomics and watch 'Let's Plays' these days, mostly to pass time till the next lecture or a new piece of content. Or even just so I can forget it all while asleep. I don't even dream.

* Compound this with a normal lack of direction, the resurgent shyness and the fact I don't understand how adult life works (let alone in a new and alien fucking country), and I'm struggling with the prospect of applying for a job or even asking the freaking bank clerk for a cheque book. I love my subject, history, but I've dropped two courses so far and lowered my workload this semester to almost nothing because I couldn't handle the (in hindsight, quite moderate) workload of last semester.

* As a relevant aside, I also have a complete apathy for relationships. Beyond occasional shallow crushes and an on the spot physical appreciation, I have no sense of.. I don't know, ""I would like to go out with her"". I just don't have that concept in my head. Since I myself cannot tell if I like her, I certainly can't tell if she approves of me, and even were that the case I would not know how to step forward from there. It's like I missed something while growing up, something major.


This has come to a culmination last week, during a gap in lecture schedule and most people going home, in which I spent half of my day asleep and the other half wishing I was. I didn't wash clothes and only 10 days later have I realised that I really should get on that, I have half eaten food all over the place that is only there because it doesn't yet smell. I'd spend most of my time wasting seconds away, and the rest freaking out about where my life is going - hell I questioned my own sexual orientation for a while and then realised it's basically moot either-way, since nothing in my life would change. I saw only one person and I both embraced the social contact and was upset I was being dragged outside. I'm in a rut which I've been digging for months and I can't will myself to get out for more than five minutes. Hell, I'm asking the internet for advice before my oldest friends. I need some help.

He is unsympathetic, he criticizes others but will not accept criticism unto himself, he is selfish and never asks how anyone elses day has been before talking about his own, he is rude, embarassing and generally has no idea how to behave towards people, he bitches and nags at my mum constantly until she is so worn down that she does whatever he wants just to shut him up. He treats my mum like shit, not in a violent way but just in that he expects her to do everything for him and if she wasn't around his life would fall apart, because growing up he was his parents' golden boy and they never taught him to do anything for himself. My whole family dislikes him, my friends and my other family members' friends dislike him. When my sister moved back home after university, she lasted about 3 months before she'd had enough and moved out again. 

My mum is the loveliest, most amazing woman ever. She is so loving and it kills me to see how my dad refuses to spend time with her yet complains when she makes plans with the few friends she has to the point that she cancels them, subsequently spending a lot of time by herself outside her job. The worst part is that she has struggled with depression for years and although she has her life together, she does go through low periods and I worry about her a lot. I particularly worry that when I go, she will be very sad and lonely (empty nest syndrome as I am the youngest), and obviously I won't be around to comfort her. My dad will be absolutely useless and will not, as ever, give her the sympathy and love she's going to need. Given her depression as a factor also, I worry that being alone with him and being so isolated might push her to have another breakdown. I know that their marital problems are not my problem, but whenever I think about this it makes me want to just stay with her. My sister and I have the luxury of leaving the situation and starting our lives, but my mum doesn't. I know it sounds terrible, but I often wish that she had the courage to leave him, because I know she deserves a better life for herself, but I know she never will.

I was under a lot of stress back then. I attributed it to her just being out of her mind and she eventually kicked me out for being an asshole to her (which was completely unfounded... so I thought) and I was shocked.

Now I'm older, married, and am used to the occasional misunderstandings with my wife. We had one spat where we even split... she thought I was bipolar, we got back together and I never sought treatment and everything has been fine since.

I have a new job now and am beginning to feel the stress. I've never really held a steady job past 6 or 8 months. I get really stressed out and quit because everyone typically despises me by that point. The only reason I'm at my current job for so long is because I work from home.

It's at a fairly trivial point at the moment but it just caused a wasted lunch... but I'm mixing things up. I'm hearing things different and saying things opposite. Like if someone asked me a question 'yes' or 'no' I would answer 'no' when I meant 'yes' and 'yes' when I meant 'no'. I know this sounds hilarious but no my wife is not f!@$ing with me.

I don't have enough insurance coverage to go anywhere professional for help. I only have coverage for a few visits a year and have used them up. I'm 26 and have never had a job. I just stay in my apartment and do whatever I feel like. Usually playing video games or working out. I have 0 friends. The only people I talk to are my girlfriend and my parents. These are the only people I can stand being around. I am lucky enough to be supported by them. It has been this way for about 6 years. My problem is I can't work or have friends because I seem to hate everyone. I am obsessed with looks and workout and groom myself constantly to look the best I can. When I'm out in public all I see is how ugly people are and I get mad. They have ugly clothes, bad bone structure, smell, or have greasy hair and its nasty. Even the littlest imperfection pisses me off. The biggest thing that bothers me is overweight people. And living in the USA it's hard to avoid them. I know it sounds weird but to me I just see gross ugly people all over and I get physically ill. After a little bit I get so angry that I can't even handle being in public. This is why I rarely leave my apartment. I'm usually by myself all day until my girlfriend comes home from work. It seems I can't stop my self from judging everyone I see down to the last detail and i see no positive things in anyone. I also am disgusted in their everyday actions or stuff they say that is completely normal to anyone else. When someone makes a joke or says a comment i just think to myself how fucking dumb they are. I have no interest in what anyone says, it just makes me upset. I realize this isn't normal but that's how I feel. I can fake being normal in social situations and have had people told me I can make friends easy because I'm charismatic and attractive. In college I would easily make friends with people from both sexes but then stop talking to them. It seems the only people I can function with properly are my girlfriend and parents. As a teenager I had a few suicide attempts and was depressed. When I got into my early 20's I stopped feeling sad, but it's almost like the depression morphed into what I have now. I have tried many different medications but they didn't really help and I hated the side effects. I just don't know why i'm so judgemental, and hate everyone so much, that I cant even leave my apartment because they sicken me. What is wrong with me?

Went off her nut for the most mundane things. Now she has punched and damaged my mums car. 

The drama started 2 weeks ago when a friend beeped outside my house letting me know she was there. It was 7.30pm on a Saturday night. My neighbour ran out of her house and began to abuse me, yelling about how rude and disrespectful I am. I tried to explain that it was early and that my friend meant no harm. However, reasoning with this woman was futile. Instead she felt the urge to talk to my parents (yes, I'm 21 and still live at home). During that talk with my mum, nothing that woman said made sense, culminating in her questioning my sexuality because apparently ""I am a bitch to her"".

The next week she cut down a tree, and dumped half of the branches in my yard. Legally we could just throw them back over, instead we decided to gather them and add them to her pile in her front yard. Her response was to throw the whole lot behind my car in the driveway. When we went over to explain that the branches were hers, she went off her nut and we couldn't even get a word in. So, we had to call the police. They had a talk to her, explained that she had to deal with the branches. Being the rational woman she was, she refused, and claimed that my mum's partner had assaulted her. But, apparently no criminal laws had been broken, so the police weren't able to do anything else.

Yesterday, as my mum was driving in a car park, she passed the neighbour, who decided to flip my mum the bird, then punch the car as my mum drove past. Again, we went to the police, but once again they said that they couldn't help us. This morning we found that she had in fact scratched the car. 

This woman is insane. We're scared for our safety and she seems to be completely unreasonable. What can we do?

I'm in love with the man of my dreams and have been living with him in relative bliss for nearly two years. Yet extenuating circumstances beyond both our control are threatening to end our otherwise perfect existence as a couple.

I'm Canadian. My boyfriend is Irish. For the past four years, he's been working toward attaining permanent residency in this country. The process is unbelievably Byzantine and maddening to the point of desperation, to put it mildly. Tl: DR, he must by law prove that he is more qualified than any Canadian in any position for which he applies. Even should he provide that proof, many employers are unwilling to hire a non-citizen due to the extra paperwork and rigmarole such a hiring involves. We have already had to move once, to an awful industrial town of 1200 people in the middle of last winter, which was an isolating and horrible experience for us both. I have been supporting us on my small journalist's income for roughly 3/4 of our relationship.

His last contract ended in June. To our great joy, he finally got an interview last week for his dream job, only to be rejected after much hedging due to not having permanent residency. On the heels of that, I just lost my job without notice due to budget cuts a the paper at which I've been employed for nearly two years. I received a tiny severance package that is rapidly dwindling. Now he must almost certainly give up on the prospect of being a Canadian citizen.

We heard the news about this latest rejection while we were at my mom's place, doing laundry while she was at work. As he anxiously fired off emails to his few remaining contacts, I sat on the floor of the laundry room and cried with tears streaming down my arms, begging out loud to no one to just let him find work and stay legal here. I have had a difficult life by anyone's standards: death of one of my parents, trouble with addiction, valiantly struggling to make sense of it all as we all do. He has been instrumental to my mental health and recovery and I will be grateful for that for as long as I live. I fail to understand why the great love of my life could be torn from me for something so simple (and yet so impossible to navigate) as this bureaucratic nonsense. 

I feel such tremendous pressure to get a new job, any job, to help pay the hundreds and hundreds of dollar in additional fees that this renegotiation of his status will require. I can't see any end to this horrible stress and pain. If we only had enough money to hire an immigration lawyer we could expedite this process; as it is, we have no recourse and no one who understands.

I ask you, reddit, what can I do to ease the heartache of a time limit on our relationship? Now that permanent residency is no longer an option for my partner, he can only say on a visitor's visa that is valid for two years only. After that, he must leave the country for two years before attempting to re-enter. I have not traveled widely, I can't imagine moving to a new country. But to continue this beautiful relationship I have to accept that as a definite eventuality. I would be willing to move anywhere, do anything, to be with him, as he has done for me. But if any of you can think of any advice to maintain our mental health, his status in this country, or any words of encouragement, I sorely need them on this dark cold fall night.",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_kicsl,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/kicsl/true_love_and_crushed_hopes_of_immigration/,

She is now 24 and is still just as awful to be around. She has to be the center of attention at all times. She makes you feel like you are walking on egg shells when you're around her, because she needs to control everyone around her and make you too uncomfortable to have an opinion, because she can be the only one with an opinion. Her general attitude is that she is amazing and always right, and if you don't agree, you're an idiot. She acts like she is doing people a favor by letting them be around her. Most times when you talk to her she turns away from you and starts talking to someone else, and then turns back to you and says, ""go ahead, I'm listening."" She does this every single time you try to talk to her about anything. She's disrespectful to my parents. She insults them and causes arguments and walks around with her nose up in the air and acts like she's wasting her time being around people that aren't kissing her ass or agreeing with every single thing she says. I am 23, and a female, and she insults me every chance she gets and her behavior is erratic. If I'm spending time with her and we are getting along, all of a sudden she goes into crazy bitch mode and starts insulting me. She insults me about many things like the clothes I wear, what my interests are, calls me snotty because I live in a nice (but average) neighborhood. Her general behavior is very erratic. One minute you could be talking wiith her and two seconds later she is yelling at you or swearing at you and throwing insults at you. Then a minute later, she's nice and acts like it never happened.

Both my parents and I have tried many times to talk to her about her behavior but it never changes. If you ask her why she's so mean and insulting, she justs acts bored and says, ""I don't know. Are we done yet?"" or she says, ""I'm not a bitch, now shut the fuck up."" Her mistreatment of people has caused many arguments in our family and I do not know how to make it better. When we were kids we were best friends; we shared so many interests and we had a wonderful relationship. I love her very much, but I don't understand why she mistreats everyone around her.

I have been feeling down and miserable lately because I can't understand how this world works.
So, I work hard everyday in a foreign country and my coworker is also from another country and it's driving me crazy.

He has 3 years more than me in here so his grasp on the local language is better (not english). He tries to show off everytime he can, even sometimes he try to ""correct"" the native speakers in here or just ""nod"" like if he understands, I even had a moment with him in a bar where a girl was talking with him and then she said in English ""You have no idea what I am talking about"" and my friend just ""well, no..."".

Anyway, I can cope with that as I try to not go out with him but sometimes can't help it as it is another coworker. Then he shared some stuff with me and how he learn, pretty much he got a girlfriend in here and learn as much as he can and then just do nasty things to her until she broke up with him.

Now he is doing the same with another girl, so every fucking week he just tell us how she doesn't want to be with his current girlfriend and then suddenly how he took his virginity, waiting for her to move back to her country so he doesn't need to deal with that, meanwhile trying to meet more girls, a total asshole, honestly.

And at work, he just doesn't listen at all, like you can be talking with him and he is only ""yes, aha... yes"" but he has no idea what he is saying, sometimes he even smiles just to dare he doesn't give a fuck and my boss just looks at him but doesn't say anything.

He fucks up at work sometimes and not even sorry. Or he say things like ""Yeah, girls should stay at the kitchen"" in front of my female coworkers like if he was proud and still they say ""Yeah, he is nice"".

Then I look at my life, no girlfriend for 2 years, working late (currently I am the only one at the office) and he is having fun.

Sorry, I know I shouldn't compare but I am starting to have this feeling of frustration on how life works that today I really wanted to hit him, my head hurts and I wish he will die (I am a bad person).

I feel miserable, I wish it was jealousy or shit like that but it's more how you can be a fucking asshole, treat girls like shit, suck at work and still go by like nothing happens.

I must be doing something wrong but seriously, just because I cannot find another work yet but even if I like it in here, I wish I could quit and move on.

How do you cope with this? Anyone have experience with asshole coworkers? (pretty sure everyone)

He also owes me money as he asked me  because he forgot his ""wallet"" after eating and my other coworker already left, he said ""I am going to the bank for some money"" but didn't pay me but to one of my female coworkers (of course!) and I asked him three times and he always says ""sorry, need to go to the bank"".

I AM FUCKING TIRED

need some advice. sometimes I really feel I should tell his girlfriend how he doesn't want to be with her, how he lies to not go with her or saying ""Ahh I am going drinking, don't want to meet her, she just can't leave me alone"" (they only see each other twice a week).

",16,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/hawi3/my_brother_is_28_years_old_and_has_been_diagnosed/,"Hey /r/cogsci,

I really need help.

After my family recently had a court order placed on him for mental evaluation, my brother has been diagnosed with schizophrenia at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. He was prescribed Resperidal (Resperidone) and was acting more normal while he was forced to take it. The problem is since he is 28 years old we cannot force him to take it and we cannot afford to pay for it. In addition, he also thinks it's some sort of mind control. Mental problems have been a recurring problem throughout his life (in his early teens he was telling family members he worked for the C.I.A.), and he has also had a lot of criminal problems leading to jail sentences multiple times.

Apparently we cannot even threaten to kick him out without 60 days notice (in comparison to 30 if he did pay rent which makes no sense). Now that he is out of the hospital and off of the medication he is getting worse again. He cannot hold a job and he cannot maintain stable relationships and has become exceedingly racist (he had a black girlfriend which I'm assuming provoked some of this). He recently has acquired a copy of the book ""The Biggest Secret"" by David Irke which he is encouraging me proves each of his theories. The author apparently went on television once and told everyone he was the son of Christ and we were gonna die in natural disasters. I'd like to reinterate he has had these thoughts well before any mention of this book, however.

I have just now recorded a rant of his (Nazis/Hitler, Free Masons, Reptiles, Jesus, Sex Slavery, Ressurection, Cloning, 2012 - some of his topics) with him confirming his name and date of birth. What can I do to force him to get some further help? Our family can't live like this and neither can he.

With that being said, let me begin by telling a bit about myself, and my situation.
I'm 20 years old, from a middle-class family, and have had a decent, albeit mediocre life.  I've always been extremely nervous my entire life, and about 4 years ago I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.  Events escalated and I had to end up dropping out of high school my senior year, and getting my diploma through the local community college.  Panic attacks and anxiety have been on and off for my through these last 4 years.  I've been on medication here and there, but nothing really long term.  I've always been afraid and weary of going on medication, especially something that alters my brain chemistry.  I mean, surely people have dealt and combated something like this before the age of medicine? What am I doing wrong?  
About 4 months ago my anxiety hit another spike, and it lasted a while getting worse, and then subsiding, but getting bad again.  It got to the point where I ended up quitting my part-time job that I had for 3 1/2 years.  A decision that I still regret to this day.  I told myself that during this time, I will get help.  I've procrastinated and procrastinated about it for months, I finally saw a therapist for the first time about 5 days ago, and will be seeing him once every three weeks.  
I guess what my point i'm trying to make here is that I am absolutely terrified of what's happening, and what i'm going to do next.  I live with my parents, but I still have car insurance and my cell bill to pay.  I've been getting by on my savings that I had, but at this rate, it will be gone in about 5 months. I'm not in school, either.  I've been trying to get by doing some computer repair jobs here and there, but most of them my anxiety tends to wiggle its way in, and prevent me from even leaving my house.  
I can't help but feel like a disappointment to my friends, and family.  I've always grown up being told that i'm going to do great things, and I've always had very supportive friends, but lately I've been pushing everyone away, and hiding from the world.  
Back in grade school and high school, there was one path to go on.  I did my work, and did what I was told to do.  After leaving high school, it's like there are so many potential paths and situations to go down, that I just freeze up instead of getting motivation.  I get overwhelmed to the fact that I have no idea what to do, so I stress out, and end up pissing the day away in front of my computer.  
I don't really know what I'm getting at, or what i'm looking for, but any kind of advice for someone in this situation would be good.  I would love to be able to go to college, and to get a new job.  I just don't know what to do to get to that point, and I don't know if i'll have the confidence and the courage to stand up to my anxiety if it comes back.  I don't want to let anyone down, like I feel that I have.  I just want to start doing something with my life already.

I naively thought the key to success was being a hard worker for businesses.  As I climbed the corporate ladder and attained a nice albeit inattentive spouse, this epiphany I had slowly melted away.

Please bear with the verbosity. This post is a cross between a rant and a plea for help. I recommend grabbing a bag of popcorn for the best experience.

The Whole Deal:
I'm a 26-year old male living with my parents in a suburban house, far away from commercial activity. I've wanted to live alone for a number of years now, although a number of issues conspire to make the process of reaching that state a giant psychological bugaboo.

Perhaps foremost among the problems is the my asymmetrical relationship with my parents. My mother and I have a very close relationship. We are each other's best friends and most trusted advisors. The vibe between me and my father is the exact antithesis of that. It has been this way for over 16 years. For even longer than that, my parents have been locked in a loveless, often antagonistic marriage. Shortly before my birth, their relationship degenerated into that of two strangers cohabiting (no exaggeration), and has not improved beyond that ever since. Neither of them ever bothered to veil their mutual disdain. Whereas any normal couple would have divorced long ago, they have stuck together because of societal pressure (it's highly taboo in their culture). I doubt their marriage has ever been in a better state, since it was forced upon them by their parents. I can't imagine my mother willingly marrying my father - they have nothing in common.

As my mother has just one good friend beside myself, I don't think I'll be able to leave home without strong feelings of guilt. I would be deserting her, leaving her alone with a person she despises. She will also have the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner for the two of them. Then again, my father hasn't brought a single dollar home in 14 years anyway. She recently confided in me what I implicitly understood all along - that I was the only reason she didn't kill herself when I was a child. I have a sickening feeling things haven't changed much for her since then.

And now to segue into the shackles held by my father. Over the years, I've slowly eradicated my mother's fear of social reprisal by engaging her in philosophical discussions about these things. This leaves one last hook by which my father is holding on. He suffered a mild heart-attack 7 years ago, and has been using that fact to guilt-trip both my mother and myself ever since. He faked heart-palpitations when I told him I was about to go on a vacation alone. Yes, faked. The doctors found nothing wrong. He hasn't touched his medicine in months (I've measured). He's gone to the ER twice, being sent back both times (""well, I guess it must have subsided as I was waiting""). Calling him out on it will get me a torrent of insults, to the effect of ""you shameless bastard! You don't believe your dying father!"". Raising the idea of leaving home will prompt that and another faked attack.

I'm losing my mind. This place began to feel like a prison years ago, and those feelings have only intensified since. I have no contacts, no acquaintances, and I'm socially inept - been this way since the age of 12. My life thus far has been a haze of monotony, the majority of which has been wasted in front of keyboards. I've been moderately depressed (often suicidal) for longer than I can remember. I've haven't been out of the city since the age of 14. It's been school, reading, work, reading, work, work, work …

I haven't' experienced anything in life besides books and computers. I don't know how to build a social network. I don't know how to negotiate business transactions. I don't know the prerequisites for living on my own, like real-estate pitfalls (e.g. avoiding unscrupulous landlords), paying my own bills, having a credit card, dealing with pests, etc.

But something is going to snap. Soon. Before it does, I need to get out. How do I do that? Should I even consider doing that? Or should I Stoically accept my place in the world? After all, I've lost my youth already. There's nothing left to lose.

(Thanks)


**edit** -&gt; I have a few more things to add, some of which may be significant. My general ineptness and cluelessness have their roots in a suffocatingly overprotective environment. I'm still ""little Bobbie"" to both my parents, and have curfews imposed on me (for their sanity, they say). They have to know at all times where I'm going and at what time I'll be back. The latter has to be earlier than 8 PM. My parents deliberately isolated me from all social groups using such curfews (6 PM when I was younger), to ""help me focus on my education"".

I was able to get a room with them, but it was already occupied by this guy, a friend (and frat brother) to one of the other guys in the suite.

For one, he's really loud. He always has people over at late hours of the night, and they're all extremely loud. My girlfriend absolutely hates sleeping at my place because of this.

Secondly, he's filthy. He'll leave dishes in the sink, and clothes in the middle of the room. I wouldn't give a shit about the clothes if they were contained to his side of the room, but when I almost trip over them every time I enter the room, it's a problem.

Thirdly, he smokes like a chimney. Hookah in the suite, cigarettes in the bathroom, etc. He ashes his cigs onto the bathroom floor, it's disgusting.

I had a job transfer set up, but was not eligible for a work visa due to the position. My boyfriend manages to support us both, but with little to spare.
  My main concern is my mother, back in Alabama. Her first husband, my father, was a doctor. He supported the family, and my mother never felt the need to go to college or look for a serious career. She was mostly a stay at home mom. That was all well and good until he passed away, then mom had to raise two kids alone on whatever job she could find. We went from a beautiful home and private school to my grandmother's basement, and eventually to a trailer once my mom had saved enough. She got remarried a few years after my dad passed, and has been happily married since. Obviously, this also helped ease her financial troubles. 
 Now, my stepdad has decided to move back to Australia and will be leaving my mother alone with my verbally abusive younger brother. To add to my mother's stress, my brother got his barely 16 year old girlfriend pregnant, and she's keeping the baby. My brother does not have a job, and sucks every dime that he can out of my mother. I feel terrible for her, I feel so awful that I'm not there for her to lean on anymore. All I want to do is help her in any way that I possibly can.
 I'm not asking for money or any kind of donation. All I want is a job.

1289919581.0,14,self.needadvice,e6z6d,Need advice. Where you young and had a baby?,18,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/e6z6d/need_advice_where_you_young_and_had_a_baby/,"Hi all. Obviously I made this account just for this post.
My son, who just turned 21, just found out that the girl he was casually seeing is pregnant with his child. He is freaked out, as am I. He doesn't want this, but it's here. One of the reasons he doesn't want this is that he doesn't really like the girl he got pregnant. She was just....a benefit. The girl likes him way more than he likes her. She was on birth control, but has now said that she ""forgot to take it one time."" I don't buy that. I don't think that skipping one pill makes one instantly able to get pregnant. I have my suspicions that this was a trap. However, I know that the pill isn't 100% effective, so there's always that tiny little chance. I've already told him that birth control is BOTH parties responsibility. I wont berate him over this, because he is upset and doing that wont help, nor will it change anything. He said it would be different if it were with someone who he loved, but in this case he doesn't. He now knows he will be connected to her for the rest of his life. 

I didn't imagine this would happen this way. I have two kids, a girl 18 and a boy 21. I actually had a secret fantasy that neither one of them would have kids...reason being is that I sort of think the world isn't in the greatest shape and bringing another human into it isn't the best thing right now. BUT, it's done and I will completely accept it and be happy....at some point. Right now I am totally floored, I am totally sad for my son. His life is forever changed now. I know that sounds negative, and a little baby is a positive thing...at least one ought to say that to be PC. It just makes me sad to think that this child will be born into a broken home. That's not fair to him/her. Also, I just can't shake the feeling that my son has had something forced onto him that he didn't want. HOWEVER, it is his fault if he didn't want to ever have kids. HE should have made sure that didn't happen, either by always wearing a condom, or NOT having sex...the latter being hard to do I know.

This all seems to me like something that just wouldn't happen to us. I know that sounds elitist, and I'm sorry if it does. I come from a family where the parents are still together. No one in any part of the immediate or distant family had a child mistakenly. I was the first person in the immediate family to get a divorce. I've been single now for 12 years and I raised the kids after the divorce without their mothers involvement. I guess I'm sort of feeling some of the guilt as well. 

Don't get me wrong. I love babies. Even though I had the opinion that my kids ought not to have any kids, I also sort of wanted a grandchild that I could spoil and cuddle with. I do very well around young kids and babies. I guess that's a plus, I can help my son with all this. Our household is going to change. There's going to be a baby in it at times. I thought I was over this..haha...I had a vasectomy about 17 years ago after my daughter was born. I guess I'm thinking that since there wont be a regular home with both parents living in it with their baby, that I'm going to have to shoulder some of all this. I'm fine with that.

I guess I'm wanting some advice from any of you young people who have had a child in the same situations as my son. How did you cope? What did you do that made it not so scary? I can give him all the advice I can on child raising...I raised two from infancy. BUT, for the first few years of their lives, I had some help from their mother, and we were in the same house. This will be different. 
I guess I'm also asking for me. I'll have to accept a family (the girls side) that I truly have NOTHING in common with. I also don't care so much for the girl either.


So...there it is. I haven't told anyone about this, neither has my son with the exception of my daughter. I guess I'm also posting this just so I can tell someone. I've been holding this in for about a week now.

Also, I realise the post is quite long, so thank you very much for your time if you choose to read it.

I'm stuck in a situation in which I don't know what to do. I'm 18, and currently in my last year of what I guess would be called high school if it were in the US. When I started this school four years ago, I made quite quickly enough friends. I felt good, didn't need much else. I consider myself to be quite friendly, and helpful to my friends. I'm not very extroverted: don't talk too much, etc.

During these years of ""high school"" I started having problems with my closest (new) friends: I felt closer to some, which certainly didn't help with the others (they perhaps felt alienated.) 
I probably care way too much about my ""best"" friends, which (as I understand) made them feel kind of suffocated.
Anyway, after a few years of this stuff, during which I kept feeling sad at more or less regular intervals, I've reached the point when it seems like nobody wants me around. Again, I'm not a jerk who you just don't want to hear, so it must be related to something else.

My ""friends"" have been going out every night and not once have I been invited along. Whenever I try and ask to do something (for example catching a movie), there's an endless flow of false excuses, to the point that I don't even bother anymore.

Basically, what I consider(ed) my best friends don't give a damn about me, and don't want me around, for reasons I don't quite understand.

 I've tried in the past to be less close to my friends, not asking to do anything, etc. but it didn't help. I just got ignored more.
Some of them actually enjoy being with me (we play tennis every week, for example), but that still doesn't change my being generally ignored when it comes to going out.

Being left out, I'm lonely (no girlfriend either) and feel quite sad. Sometimes I can refrain from thinking about it: I've started going to the gym for example, which takes my time at least; but usually (especially friday and saturday night) it gets quite tough.

Next year I'll be out of this school anyway: I'm going to have a spare year (in which, without any friends, I don't know what I'm gonna do), and then start uni. Apart from the present, I'm also worried about the future: that year I mentioned is going to feel long, and will I make any friends in uni? What's wrong with me?

I'm asking for advice both short term and long term. I want to be with my friends now, at least have some, and not be lonely next year, and the one after that.

Does anybody have any suggestions? Please?

I don't mean to be self-pitying, but those are the facts. Anyway, I need to move on but I'm not sure in what direction I should be moving. I want to finish a degree in software engineering, but I have the following—*hopefully unfounded*—fears:

* I'll graduate at around 28-29 and consequently will have a hard time finding a job without SE work experience at that age. I think this may be even more significant because of my major.

* My personal life will suffer because I'm unwilling to delay my graduation by going to school part-time and juggling that many hours with a job that pays for rent doesn't seem possible. This means I'd have to live with my parents and would make dating impossible (trust me here). I think this would seriously reduce my chances of finding someone I'd like to spend the rest of my life with let alone having a kid.

* People looking down on me *after* college. This bothers me more than it should because I'm hypersensitive to negative evaluation (but don't worry about upsetting me in your comments, seriously).

My alternatives seem to be:

* Change my major (I'd really prefer not to, but if their are better options, I'm willing).

* Forget about college now and get a low paying job for between 1-7 years while looking for a serious relationship. If I have or haven't found a relationship at the end or during those 7 years I'd return to college. Unfortunately, I'd probably feel even worse about returning, but I'll man up if it's best.

* Go to a trade school? I know very little about this.

* Find a good job that doesn't require a degree (I don't know if this is practical in this century).

* Simply be happy with a low paying job and no degree.

Some important details:

* Software engineering has a [great job outlook](http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm#outlook), maybe this will mitigate my lack of experience?

* I'm very good with C/C++ and decent at reverse engineering.

* I can learn other languages quickly.

I'm grateful for anyone's support, advice, or brutal honesty.


Edit: Actually, it's more accurate to say these are fears about graduating at 28-29.

Edit2: **Thank you everyone**. Reading your comments made a huge impact on me. It's funny, these fears I had were really eating at me, and now I feel stupid for ever considering them. I'm also surprised by how many warm and caring responses I received because I really wasn't expecting that level of consideration from strangers. It gives me more faith in humanity.

So, I can't say thank you enough to everyone here, but thank you!

I am currently at the end of my rope, and need advice or suggestions on what I should do with my life.  In the box, out of the box, whacky.. any advice is welcome.  

The last three years have been really fucking brutal on me.. In late 2007 my Dad died from cancer, in 2008 one of my good friends died from liver cancer at 32, and that same year my close Uncle died.

In early 2009 a 28 year old very close friend of mine, who was NOT overweight died from a heart attack. Later that same year I lost my job when my company went out of business, and then to make sure the year ended awesome, my girlfriend, who I was fucking crazy about, broke up with me.  

Earlier this year, a girl who I dated a few years earlier (I broke it off because I moved), who contacted me when she found out I was single wanting to date again,  committed suicide.  Over the last month, my ex has called me three times to let me know she was staying at some dudes house, and once butt dialed me while having sex.

Finally, I am 100% broke, cant find a job, an about to lose a car I've almost paid off, haven't paid rent yet this month, and my I have to move out by the end of the month.

I am not suicidal, but man I am just really really having a hard time.  Every-time I get happy, something shitty happens.  I moved from the West Coast to Boston for work, and I fucking hate this town.  Sure, there is a ton to do, and tons of college girls, but this is the hardest place to make friends that I've EVER lived… in fact, in my group of friends (about 20), only one is from this area.

So, I want to change things up.  I was thinking I should sell all my shit, and just go someplace.I can make about 6k from my car, and probably another 4k at the very least from all other stuff I own.. but Im also probably not thinking straight, so advice is needed.

WTF do I do now?,14,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/amzmc/i_was_adopted_today_i_discovered_who_my_birth_mom/,"A few weeks ago I called the person at an adoption agency who has been (very occassionally) trying to contact my birth mother on my behalf for the last couple years. Birth mom has so far not responded with any information - which is a disappointing and a bit infuriating.  However, I remind myself that I cannot imagine what must be going through her head hearing from me 36 (now 38) years after giving me away and being told she would almost certainly never hear from or about me ever again.  

I decided I would try writing a non-identifying letter to tell birth mom that I am grateful for what she did, that I have great parents and I grew up well (enough) adjusted, and now that I have my own family I really just want to know my medical history and ethnicity. I sent that letter to my agency person asking to send it along to my birth mom, however possible, as another attempt at getting her to respond.

I got a call back today. The agency person spoke to birth mom again but caught her at an awkwardly bad time. I don't want to give too many details. Suffice to say that the person at the adoption agency who is helping me, who I only speak to once or twice a year, accidentally (on purpose I think) let slip my birth mom's first name. I had previously guessed at my birth mom's last name based on a detail (I assume inadvertently) left in the non-identifying information I got from the County almost 3 years ago. I asked a roundabout question about that detail, and the agency person gave a plausibly-deniable answer confirming that I am right about birth mom's last name. So, now I know her first and maiden name.

From previous conversations with agency person, I know what industry birth mom works in, and that she was very easy enough to find on google because of her position at her company and in her community.

Without giving away too many details, I know who my birth mom is. I know where she works and where she lives - at least as far as the Internet knows.

I'm in my early twenties.  I live at home with Dad and his wife. They've been married for around 7-8 years.  They just bought a new house and some land to put it on a year or two ago.  They went into considerable debt doing this.  I pay rent and I work fulltime and go to school part time.  I recently discovered that my stepmom is going to online dating websites with intent to find someone.  Judging by the pictures she's posted on the dating profile, she's not looking for just a friend. 
Let me give you some background on my dad.  He's been a recluse most of his life raising me and my brother off a piss poor salary.  He's making good money now however.  This woman has made my dad extremely happy over the last few years. I know he loves this woman. I never felt as though she loved him however. I feel as though she is just in a marriage with him because it's secure and comfortable. There is no drama, no financial issues, not many family conflicts etc. She's not much into PDAs.
If this woman divorces him, my dad will be a wreck.  The extreme amounts of debt they have accomulated is also a problem.  I'm worried if they break it off, my dad is going to lose everything he's worked his whole life to get, because he can't handle the debt by himself.

I feel guilty for feeling the way I do, and I'm possibly just very immature and expecting too much out of life.

I have been with this company since I was fresh out of high school 8 years ago. Basically my entire adult life, this is the only real job I've ever known. It was *supposed* to be something I did while going to college and then quit once I pursued my new career, but I never could decide what I wanted to do. So here I am, spinning my tires in the same rut all these years later. Tons of regret.

I work in an office for a large corporation doing mostly accounts payable, budgeting, accounting, and a little HR on the side. I hate it, but it's not because of the job itself (I don't think). I've never felt fulfilled a single day in my life; I just have no idea what I really want to be, besides a wife and a mom. And honestly, that's all I ever want to be, but it's not at all realistic. My husband doesn't make as much money as me and his job doesn't provide benefits, while I have a pretty good salary and excellent benefits.

I guess that's the real issue here. Being a housewife and work from home mom is never going to happen for me, so my ""dream job"" is unattainable. Call me crazy (or really fucking boring), but all I want to do is keep the house spotless, cook and bake from scratch, make sure my husband has every single need and want met, raise our kids myself, and all of that good stuff. I do all of those things now (besides the kids because we don't have them yet), but not to the extent that I'd like to because of time constraints and depression/exhaustion due to my job.

Reality is, I'm getting a big promotion and a new office soon, and I'd be completely nuts not to accept it. But I don't want it (which I realize is horrible because I should be *so grateful*) simply because I know that taking this step means I'm most likely going to be here until retirement.

I see the senior women at my company and they are frazzled, stressed, working OT almost every day. How is having my family, and caring for them like I want to, going to possibly fit into that?

A little background before I start:  My parents split when I was about 10, and my brother 12. We stayed living with our mother, who just short of neglected us. Then when we were roughly 12 and 14, my brother went to live with our dad who was fighting for custody of him at my brother's own request. My mom had started drinking shortly before this, and it progressively got worse until she was a raging, abusive alcoholic and I was the only one around for her to take her anger out on. It wasn't pretty at all, but I endured the worst of it for nearly two years before my dad found out and got custody of me as well.

Now, my current problem: I really want nothing to do with my mother, for obvious reasons. But at my father's insistence I try to fix my relationship with her, I at least let her have my phone number. She calls every few months, and I honestly do my best to minimize contact beyond these. I'm nice, and I don't treat her badly because she seems like she is really trying to have a normal relationship with me, but it's strained. She usually sneaks in a bit of guilting that I don't go out of my way to contact her, but I can normally shrug it off and move on. Half the time she doesn't even answer when I try to initiate a call. 

And then at 11:30 tonight, she calls me. I don't mind her calling me late, as I stay up late anyway.

Except now she's completely and totally wasted, though I didn't realize it at first.

The conversation started out alright, her just asking me how things are going and how my classes are going. However, I started noticing some oddness when she becomes somewhat hard to understand. And then she passes off the phone to her husband, who proceeds to ask me the same things, with declining coherency. He finally hands the phone back to my mother (which is good, because I *do not like* him. He makes me uncomfortable.), who then proceeds to start with the usual ""You never call me, you never come see me"" bit.

Except this time, she doesn't stop, and it's around this time I realize she's thoroughly drunk. I then sit through ten minutes off her talking about how I never come see her, I won't make time for her, and that I'm probably not telling my brother to call her like she wants because she hasn't gotten one from him. How I purposely didn't call her on mother's day or her birthday. I try to explain, through my shock and growing upset (both at the realization she's calling me drunk to basically tell me I'm a shitty daughter) that I don't have time. I'm a college student (doing summer classes right now) and I work, so I don't really have time to jump up and ask my dad to drive me 4-5 hours to see her any random time. 

Apparently, having my own busy life is not a good reason, and she continues for another few minutes about how I don't have time for her, why won't I make time for her? And then she hands off the phone to her husband *once again*.

I get the same spiel from him, only this time he's barely understandable, and all I can make out is him telling me my mother is not trying to ruin my life and to all her. At this point, I'm so upset I have pretty much stopped answering, claimed the signal was going out so the call was breaking up, promised to try and make time to see her, and hung up. There was also something going on in the background about me having seven boyfriends or something.

I don't know how to handle this anymore. 

No, I don't really want a relationship with her, but I've made an effort. I've been trying to forgive her for the hell she put me through, and how she refuses to acknowledge any of it happened. I've tried to contact her when she's given me radio silence for months.

I'm upset and hurt, both that the first time I manage to get in contact with her in months involves her *drunk dialing* me, and that she so thoroughly guilted me for having a life, when she's made no effort to return the attempts. And the worst of it all is she got her husband in on it too.

I don't know if I'm in the right or the wrong anymore, or if she's right and I am just being a shitty daughter who needs to suck it up and deal with her.

Should I suck it up and do what she wants? Should I go see her even though it's something I don't want to do, in the name of being a ""good daughter""? Am I wrong for being upset?

I don't know what to do or how I should approach this from this point on.

And this will be really long, but please read it.

Let me give you some background information on myself. I'm 15 years old guy about to be a junior in high school. I get decent grades, A's and B's with the occasional C in a class I have more trouble with, such as math. Granted, I could get much better grades than that in school if I try harder, I'm really smart, and that's one of my goals. I am a varsity wrestler for my high school and a black belt in Kempo. I've never been high once in my life, never been to a crazy party and got wasted, and never had sex. 

For the past 3 years or so, I haven't been the star child to my parents. There have been many occasions in which I have been rude or obnoxious, kind of giving off the vibe like I don't want to be around them anymore. This isn't true, I love them with all of my heart but I don't understand what comes over me sometimes. I get all upset with them for the smallest things and they notice it, and get mad at me for being so superficial. This has gone on for years, and sure there have been times when I have tried being nice to them for a while and it has worked, but I always seem to revert back.

Recently this behavior has become more prevalent and they've justly have had enough. My dad and mom are so fed up with me that my dad has told me he doesn't care what I do anymore because all I do is give him trouble. My mom yells at me for all of the small things I ever do wrong, and I can't handle it anymore because they make me feel like I have to be perfect. My sister doesn't want to get involved with the problems my parents and I have with each other so there goes someone to talk to about it. They said they're going to do nothing for me anymore instead just provide me with the necessities. My friend pressured me into joining this wrestling club that meets 2x a week but now my parents won't let me go and I don't know how to break it to him 2x a week I can't go, slowly breaking our trust for each other. I know this is all my fault but I don't know how to fix it. They don't want to talk to me so I try to stay as far away as I possibly can day in and day out just so I don't have to feel like shit. I'm disappointed in myself and I don't know what to do. I've tried saying sorry but they won't hear it, I am completely lost. I'm not a bad kid... Please, help me with this situation, what would you do. I am really so sorry that I put my parents through this and I do love them but I don't know what to do anymore. Advice?

TL;DR: I'm a good kid who isn't a troublemaker outside of the house but my parents want nothing to do with me anymore and I still have a few years until I go to college. I was a jerk to then for years but now I've dug myself into a hole and I'm not sure if I can get out of it.

1372455713.0,12,self.needadvice,1h9ws1,Do I stand a chance fighting this charge from my apartment complex???,14,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1h9ws1/do_i_stand_a_chance_fighting_this_charge_from_my/,"Story:
(As a pre-cursor: An ex-roommate of mine was getting evicted for not paying the last two months worth of rent and skipped out of town a few days prior to this incident.)

A friend of ours from San Antonio was making his way through Austin around midnight and asked if he could crash on the couch and take off the next morning. He also happened to have his dog with him. 

So the next morning comes and the head location manager for our apartments came through to evict the ex-roommate. We told her the room was exactly how he left it and she locked the door. Before leaving, however, she glanced over to see our friends dog then jetted out of our apartment without saying a word. 

Next thing I know, I receive an e-mail stating that I owe $400 for housing an unregistered pet in my apartment. I call to the front explaining the situation and I'm told I can't talk to the manager directly nor through the phone. That I must email her but if I explained the situation politely, she should let me off of the hook. So I do so. Despite painting the scenario, she insisted on me still paying the fee. After a few exchanged emails pleading with her to let this go as a warning and asking her to place herself in my shoes... still no dice.

Now we called to the front office acting as someone else saying that our brother was coming into town and had his dog with them, what was the policy on that. And the girl working the telephones said that **as long as none of the other roommates had any problems, and the dog wasn't staying for more than a couple of days that no fines would be issued.**

Exactly after that and coincidently enough, the actual apartment maintenance team came through for end-of-year inspections. After explaining the situation those two gentlemen didn't see a problem and insisted that we shouldn't be getting fined.

So THEN, we called the front once more acting as someone else and once again, they okay'ed a pet staying only this time we recorded the phone conversation. [Phone call can be heard here](http://www.sharebeast.com/pkyenqza1hgu)

Granted they do have a blanket statement in the lease saying *""Resident acknowledges that animal sitting &amp; visiting on the premises and unit for any amount of time are prohibited""* but EVERYONE we've talked to living here was asked questions or received warnings and EVERYONE else working the apartment is green lighting the situation. I feel as if we're being victimized because some jerk roommate skipped town on them and she is trying to recoup on her rent loss. 

Now I'm contemplating getting an attorney, the BBB, the local news, and the Austin Tenant's Council involved with hopes of striking down this charge.

Are there any lawyers or someone that has any wherewithal on a situation like this that knows if I have a ground to stand on??? This is absolutely unfair that I'm getting charged $400 that I can't afford because I was being a good friend and letting someone sleep rather driving an additional hour half asleep behind the wheel. The dog wasn't on the premises any longer than 10 hours.

I really hope someone can help :(

1371961122.0,12,self.needadvice,1gw5ub,Any tips on overcoming panic brought on by human shouting?,12,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1gw5ub/any_tips_on_overcoming_panic_brought_on_by_human/,"About ten years ago, I was present during a murder. It was traumatic and scary, but I was young and was able to move on.

Then a year ago, I woke up to screaming outside my window in the middle of the night. And it was like a switch went off in my brain. I immediately jumped out of bed and flew outside in my nightgown, searching for the source, in a panic to stop whatever was going on. It was strange, though, because it was like I was outside of myself, just running on basic instinct. Like the scream had triggered something inside me. It ended up being a woman behind my house who had been walking home from the bars when a man grabbed her and pulled a knife on her. She was able to pull his hand away from her mouth and start screaming and neighbors came to her rescue.

But the instant I was pulled out of sleep by that scream I was immediately back to the crime scene from my childhood. It was the same scream, a human, primal, raw scream that can't be faked or acted. Somehow, waking up to that seemed to reawaken the event I went through ten years earlier. I felt incredibly shaken up, but also mad at myself for feeling so shaken up - nothing happened to *me* directly, I wasn't a victim. What right do I have to feel upset? 

Flash forward to a month after the incident with the woman, and I am at a Christmas party. Lots of laughter, kids running around, people drinking. Suddenly, that scream - that same scream, something-is-wrong scream. My body went ice cold. Before I even knew what had happened, I knew something was wrong. I gathered the kids around me and told them to sit quietly while I went into the other room. Whatever had happened, I didn't want them to witness it. One of the men had collapsed and was seizing, then went catatonic, ghostly white, non-responsive. He later recovered, but again, that scream - I was completely shaken. 

It's been nearly a year and I still freeze up now whenever I hear human shouts. For example, two young girls just went skateboarding by my living room and one of them was yelling out of joy as they went faster and faster. But when I heard her yell, before I could recognize it as one coming from a happy source, my stomach dropped and my body froze. I get filled with terror and can't shake it for up to an hour after. Sometimes, especially at night, I feel wound up as if I'm on the defensive, every nerve finely tuned and waiting for something to spring out at me, for a scream to pierce the night, for someone to get hurt or be in danger.

How can I go back to being my old, calm self? How can I learn to combat this terror that springs up at any loud sound? I used to be very calm, but I often feel on edge now. I thought it would fade away with time, but it doesn't seem to be doing that.

I would appreciate any advice you might have for me. I apologize for the length of this. I tried to keep it short but failed, sorry. :/",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_1gw5ub,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1gw5ub/any_tips_on_overcoming_panic_brought_on_by_human/,

(wall o' text)",16,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1gnt9s/my_boss_and_friendcoworker_have_made_me_paranoid/,"
I recently discovered that my boss, whom I adored, has been lying, manipulating and back-stabbing me for years now.   And, to top it off, one of my best “friends”, who is a co-worker, has been in cahoots with him!  I am heart-broken, so ANGRY I am scaring myself, have contemplated suicide daily and have started having panic attacks for the first time ever in my life.  It’s made me paranoid and distrustful.  I need advice on how to cope with this mess.  I am currently on medical leave due to stress and am trying to let the anxiety go so that I can get my mind back.

Backstory:  I am a manager and have worked there for 15+ years.  It’s a very good job with retirement, benefits, etc. – I’m lucky, I know it.  I thought he and I had a very good relationship - we laugh, talk, work well together, etc.  But, when he first became my boss, he made a mistake that embarrassed him with the higher-ups (because he didn’t listen to my advice!) and used that as an excuse to give some duties to my “friend” – I am technically her supervisor.  Over time, he’s given her more of my duties and has told me repeatedly that it’s because his/our higher-ups consider me a screw up and have insisted that I not perform these duties.  He’s made out one person to be basically evil and out to get me.

But, I recently had this lightning bolt thought: “What if that’s not true?” and so I asked them.  Sure as shit, it’s all been a pack of lies – they don’t have problems with my work, it was just his preference to give my duties to her!

He’s a well-thought of person, distinguished, charming, and obviously a glib liar.  He got away with it by insisting that I keep my mouth shut with the higher-ups and let him handle communications.  I can’t tell you how many times he’s raised my blood pressure, had me ranting and raving, my nerves shot, my esteem shot, telling me that, though he likes me very much and thinks I do wonderful work, the upper echelons have it out for me – it’s taken YEARS off of my life due to stress and cost me untold anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc.  I feel so angry with both of them that I never want to see or speak to either of them ever again.

FOR YEARS now I have been asking myself why the higher-ups don’t like me, what’s so wrong with me, etc. and my self-esteem is just fucking shot to hell.  My trust in people is annihilated – I was such a patsy – I fell for it!  I know it’s naïve but I like people mostly, I trust(ed) people and now I feel like I cannot trust the majority of people.

To top it all off, the two of them recently made some changes in staffing duties and announced the changes without my knowledge so now I have 2 staff members that have started up with attitudes because they have zero respect for me…obviously, because I have no authority as far as they can tell.

To top it off even MORE, OF COURSE, some of this involves money – he’s been raiding some accounts to pay himself extra money and to fund his pet projects…with her help! (I discovered this after I did some digging because I asked myself “Why?” and I learned years ago to always always ALWAYS follow the money.)  I told the higher-ups about this because, ultimately, I am responsible for the accounts and I’d be damned if they’d pin it on me!  The higher-ups have been very kind to me, signed off on my sick leave, are working to sort this all out, are happy to give me good references, etc.  But, it remains to be seen what will happen.  It COULD be that he will be demoted and I would have a new boss.  It could be that he will remain, having had his hands slapped.  If I get a new boss, I could stay.  If he stays then obviously I will have to go (he told me recently that he “doesn’t feel he can trust me."" – ha!  What a fucking JOKE that was, I now realize.

So, yeah, I am bitter.  I am looking for another job, just in case he sticks around, but, damn, there aren’t many jobs that pay well and have good benefits like this one.

But how?  HOW do I let go of this anger, this anxiety, this depression, this betrayal?  It is eating me up.  Whenever I think about it I start with the panic attacks, so, I try NOT to think about it.  But, I’ve got to come to grips with it at some point and go on.   I just don’t understand conniving, manipulative people like this – I would NEVER do something like this to anyone!  I like people.  I am kind to people.  I am well-liked.  I don’t deserve this!  And STUPID.  I feel SO STUPID having been so thoroughly duped.  

TL:DR  My boss and one of my “best friends”/co-worker are manipulative, lying sacks of shit who have destroyed my sanity and self-esteem and made my work life a faux hell.  How do I regain my trust in others and let go of the hurt and MONUMENTAL ANGER I am feeling?  Have YOU ever dealt with something like this?  What did you do?  How did it turn out for you?

I've lived in on-campus student housing for five years.  For the past three years, there have been severe, ongoing issues.  Those closest to me have suggested possible harassment due to the fact that it's caused psychological issues (see below) and the staff clearly just doesn't want to help.


**Terms of the lease**  ...just to state a few.
* Right to... Read and study free from undue interference in one’s room. * Right to... Unreasonable noise and other distractions inhibit this right.
* Right to... Sleep without undue disturbance from noise, guests of roommates, etc.
Be free from fear of intimidation or physical and emotional harm.
* If the problem [noise] persists, a complaint can be filed with the hall or village office. Accordingly, if another student requests that a noisy behavior be discontinued, this request should be honored.

**Year 1**
Nothing involving staff until the end of my lease.  When staff came in to clean the apartment for a resident that was moving into a bedroom, they cracked my laptop's casing, caused screen issues on my laptop, and used my personal cooking supplies to clean between small crevices.  They barely acknowledged my complaint, and I wasn't reimbursed for lost property.  

I found a used match on my bed and my bedroom's deadbolt to be very loose after a health/safety inspection.  I don't smoke or own matches, and my door's lock was about to fall off the door.  They said ""Don't worry about it.""  

I asked to be moved to a different on-campus location for the following year, and it was granted by someone high-up and beyond my complex director.

**Year 2**
The folks above me were very loud.  They'd keep me up and wake me up because of their music no matter the time or day of the week.  It got to the point that I would hear things in my ceiling vibrating (pipes, etc).  Turns out he had a subwoofer, which explains why I only heard the bass.  Landlord and the complex staff addressed it, but never fixed it.  

I was once asked to leave my apartment by the other tenant because he was having a party and I needed to study.  Staff addressed it, and said he's not allowed to talk to me unless I approach him (my safety, my choice).  I was ok with that until I ended up having to sleep in my car multiple times because staff couldn't/wouldn't enforce noise control.

I spent 2/7 nights a week here because of the noise.  I could not sleep or study here without being interrupted on a consisten basis.

I ended up having to move to get away from the noise near the end of my lease.

**Year 3**
It was fine until the tenant below me started pumping her music.  It would wake me up and keep me up at all hours of the day.  I could sing to it at times because it was loud enough to hear the lyrics.  Staff addressed it, but ended up saying I'm not to approach her (not sure why, I'd only spoken to her twice).  

The complex director ended up coming over and setting a maximum volume for her, and if I could hear it above that, I was to call the office and she'd get in trouble if it was indeed above that volume.  Well, that didn't work.  I was told ""It wasn't a rule, just a suggestion.  I won't enforce it.""

If I called the office, they'd listen at her front door (no knock, no talking to her), and then tell me ""I can't hear anything.""  They started listening in my room then.  Even if it was above the ""maximum volume,"" they wouldn't do anything.

I spent 2/7 nights a week here because of the noise.  I could not sleep or study here without being interrupted on a consisten basis.


My boss required me to go to counseling because of the stress I was under due to these events.  He knew about it all and tried to help me, but required I see someone to talk about this.

I was adopted by my mom and dad. Parents divorced when I was six, mom remarried my stepdad when I was 11. I am currently 23.  Stepdad is the brother of mom's family therapist that she fell for (therapistman led her on something fierce) when she and my dad were divorcing. 

Mom abused my younger brother and I as we were growing up, and my stepdad (who has/had his own bundle of crazy) was a prime target for her malice. My mom was overbearing, controlling, and emotionally abusive to me while dismissive and physically abusive with my younger brother. My stepdad was treated like a punching-bag-meets-ATM for almost ten years before they divorced. Mom claimed she had DID and borderline personality and bailed out of state before the divorce proceedings could begin to follow her new female therapist across the country in an enmeshed relationship (my mother refers to her therapist as her mother). 

As we grew up, my mom was a source of chaos in the stepfamily and my younger brother and I have constantly been caught in the crossfire. My stepdad, in his fits of rage and revenge against my mother (and my younger brother and I, who were trying our best to be teenagers in an extremely unhealthy environment where we were pawns to our mother's rage), would send off nasty emails detailing just how horrible his life was, how awful his kids were, how he absolutely hated us and that we were simply reflections off of the facets of my broken mother. My mom had installed tracking software on his computer to capture every keystroke. Whenever my stepdad spoke ill of us (in particular, me) my mother would call us in to the bedroom and read the emails to us as we looked over her shoulder to see who the email went to and when. 

My stepdad was the parent left in charge after my mother took off. I was 20, my brother 18, and neither one of us were fully cognizant of the decades of psychological damage and emotional trauma we had been living under until we had the opportunity to live independently of my mother. I had moved into the dorms and out of the house when I was 18, and stayed out after my mother and I had a huge fight in the spring of my freshman year at college. I attempted suicide a number of times before I was able to seek professional help and began to understand that my mother was an abuser. My brother got caught up in hard drugs and alcohol at age 15 and hasn't stopped since. I was diagnosed with GAD and PTSD, one year after another. When I was raped, it was my stepdad I went to in order to ask for help. I still haven't told my mother. That's the last thing I need. His idea of helping me was paying for three sessions of therapy and then insulting and harassing the therapist to the point where she was about to call the police to put a restraining order on him. She had the evidence necessary to do so. When I asked him why he was acting so inappropriately, he cut off all contact with me and told me never to ask him for anything again. I haven't spoken to him in over a year.

I recently found out my stepdad was dying...two weeks after he was put in the hospital. He has cancer all over his body; it has metastasized into his lymph nodes, lung, thyroid and bones. He also has a gigantic mass in his lung, and pneumonia as the icing on the shitcake. No one was going to tell me, until my younger brother called my stepdad to see how he was doing (he likes to randomly contact people like that). He called me as soon as he found out. When I confronted my stepbrother on the issue, he said that no one was going to tell me because they ""didn't want me to freak out.""

I, for one, feel that enduring the hellspawn that was my mother was enough to bond us all in some way. The news that my stepfather is going to die is tearing me apart. Our relationship hasn't been the greatest; after all, years of public disgrace in emails to the extended stepfamily takes its toll on my ability to trust my stepdad for anything he said. But a part of me has always cared. I've always known that he had serious baggage that would permanently effect the way he interacted with me and my younger brother, let alone everyone else (believe me, people know he's a fair bit of crazy too). 

I feel that not telling me that my stepdad is dying because they ""didn't want to freak me out"" is absolute bullshit. I am deeply offended and hurt that I wasn't contacted as an immediate family member after everything we had all been through. I'm one of the last to know. My stepbrother has moved into my childhood home which is currently operating as a waystation for all of the other family members who are coming into town to see him. My stepbrother is treating me as if I'm an inconvenience. I know that the family that's in town doesn't want anything to do with me because all they see is the nine-year-old girl caught up in her psychotic mother's schemes. 

I'm going to see my stepdad in the hospital, despite his constant texts that say he just wants rest. My stepbrother, on the other hand, has been there damn near non-stop. I didn't even know he was in town until my younger brother called to tell me. A part of me is hoping that the stepfamily will see past the bullshit and respect me as a part of the family, but the larger part of me knows they won't. 

How do I handle this? Do I confront my stepbrother on the ""not freaking me out"" bullshit excuse? Do I tell my stepdad that I know what he went through with my mother's abuse (we haven't talked about it yet)? Do I try to establish an identity and relationship with the stepfamily as an independent person from my mother, or do I simply let them go since they haven't reached out to me in years? 

This hurts pretty fucking badly. I've cried every night since I heard the news and spoke ever-briefly with my stepbrother, who was terribly anxious to get off of the phone before I even picked up from the phone call (after I texted him, asking why he didn't tell me).

Her parents are divorced and her Mom seems to be going through some type of mid-life crisis.

I don't know what to do with the negative feelings.",13,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1e6g5q/im_student_president_of_a_wing_of_my_university/,"I'm not someone who has ever had trouble with getting on with people. The position I'm in is an elected one, and I've always had lots of friends. So I am rather surprised to find myself in this situation. At the age of 25, I now know what hate feels like.

I am chair of a council of student-elected representatives. A number of the reps have been useless. Utterly useless. I've spent a lot of time picking up the slack. Unfortunately, the ones who have been remiss are the ones who are most visible. The finances of the council are in a mess and I'm trying desperately to get them together- despite not being financially minded and having 0 training in this department. I am meant to oversee, but when there is nothing happening to oversee, I am essentially having to take it all on board.

I have spent this past year working my ass of trying to make things better for students. I've organised events, been to meetings, prepared documents, answered COUNTLESS emails. I've also been pretty unwell- I have had the flu three times (I think partially due to stress fucking up my immune system) and I also had an emergency operation a few months ago. Add to this I have suffered a string of bereavements- 4 in 10 days, really I shit you not- and when I went home to deal with these bereavements, I was still having to have telephone meetings to pick up the slack of other reps.

Please bear in mind I am not paid for this. I get a very small meal allowance, about 1 meal a week. I also get the right to accommodation, but I still have to pay for it.

So, there is this woman on the staff. She has been there a year and from what I understand, has been generally destructive. We've had a number of run ins before and she is the queen of the passive aggressive email, but I've always disliked her and slightly feared her mostly from a distance. In person it's been mostly civil, though I hate getting emails from her. My mum had suggested that I should try to communicate in person as her emails are so off, but as I found out this week that isn't going to work either.

After discovering something she had done that she doesn't have the power to do (changing the council's constitution), and after discussing with the person who had occupied my role before her, I went to go and see her. Gently I informed her that if she wanted us to make the change, we would have to discuss it at a meeting and that it can't be ratified without us voting on it. She proceeded to rip me to shreds. She didn't shout- she's not that person. She smiled as she undermined everything I have busted my gut to do. 8 hours spent at a desk not eating lunch while I write a proposal for an event. The countless days where I've been unable to do my own studying. The nights I've spent washing and cleaning student spaces. She told me I had done nothing and basically a bunch of other stuff too. I have never been spoken to like that. I was hugely distressed. I was in tears as soon as I left. 'Crying my eyes out' would be an appropriate description (seriously, my eyes hurt so much I had to take my contacts out!!!!)

An hour later, I had to go to  a big meeting with her. I could have called her out, but I didn't. Afterwards, in front of a lot of the university's governors, she gave me this weird half-hug and gave a bizarre, half-apology. I don't know how genuine it was. It seemed very forced, but at the same time if she really was sorry I don't want to discount that.

My problem is that I am now left with a huge amount of negative feeling. I have this ball of hate in the it of my stomach. I feel completely used and I am so angry at myself for...running in the first place. Jeopardising my degree. Wasting my time. I keep beating myself up for not doing a good job, though others have told me I have. 

I know this isn't a major problem, and I'm sorry if this sounds like a big whinge. I guess I'm really lucky to have got so far in life without meeting this kind of treatment. Don't get me wrong. I just know that I'm not myself anymore. It's been a week and I still feel deeply unhappy. I don't know what to do to eradicate these feelings. I just feel angry and deeply sad.

1366798771.0,11,self.needadvice,1d02ap,Motivation and of the Lack of Direction,16,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1d02ap/motivation_and_of_the_lack_of_direction/,"**Warning: wall-of-text**

I'm not really sure where to begin, but I'll try to separate things in a somewhat logical way..

Over the past few years I've grown more and more apathetic towards, well, pretty much everything. I don't know if it's laziness, if I have no tangible motivation, or anything else. Things have just sort of spiraled over the last few months.

I get literally zero exercise (read: sitting at the computer from wake until sleep, sans getting food/using bathroom). It seems like I'm always tired. Sleeping 4 hours or 16 makes virtually no difference. I'll become tired again after being awake for only 8 or 10 hours, and I yawn constantly throughout the day. Some days I could go right back to bed after waking up and it wouldn't make a difference in terms of tiredness. I wake up tired, I go about my day tired, and I go to bed tired. It could be sleep apnea, it could be depression, it could be apathy, being overweight/out-of-shape..

My sleep schedule is also all kinds of fucked up. On average I'll sleep from 6AM to 5PM (when my mother gets home). I'll get on a normal schedule for a day or two when I have to work the weekend, or have an appointment, but then my sleep schedule just reverts to sleeping during the day, and being awake at night. It's been like this for years, even during college, where I'd be awake at night, get a few hours of sleep before class (or none at all), then more sleep later. Even when some commitments force me to be awake during the day, I still end up reverting back to ""nocturnal mode.""

I feel like I'm the laziest piece of shit alive, because I can barely bring myself to DO anything, even the things I enjoy! I enjoy writing, and I'm also developing an indie game with a friend, which is also enjoyable. The problem is that I can't even bring myself to do these things, the things I ENJOY! I just don't have the energy or motivation; something is clearly wrong here.

I'm determined not to get sucked into a 9-5 job I probably won't even enjoy, yet somehow I'm not motivated enough to pursue my personal interests and make something of them. I know I can't succeed on my own if I don't even have the motivation to work on my game, or pursue my writing, both of which I feel are paramount to my happiness, and ultimately, personal success. To top it all off, student loans are looming, and I'll be paying them in a few short months.

I have a part-time job and I've saved a few thousand dollars to give myself a bit of time before my loans come due, but at this point in my life, I feel like I don't have direction. I don't *know* where my life is going, or what to do with it, and that scares me.

Important things worth mentioning:

* I *don't* want to work for someone else for the rest of my life (or even for the foreseeable future!).
* I *want* to lose weight.
* I *want* to find motivation. I *need* to find it.

Even though these things are all important to me, I basically have zero motivation to actually *accomplish* them, and it sucks. I *want* to earn success in my own right, but I feel like I just don't have the energy or the drive to achieve it.

I'm disappointed in myself. I know how bad it is to live like this, but I've never seen the need to change. Now that I'm a grown man (23), I'm ashamed of the the things I've wanted to accomplish but never have, and the fact that I know that, in my current state of living, I have no reasonable expectations of achieving the goals I've currently set for myself. I hate that so many others have found the motivation to work on their projects, but I can't be bothered to do anything other than Reddit or play video games for most of the day after waking up after sleeping 12 hours, feeling tired and apathetic, unwilling to do the things I *know* will help me change my life.

What the hell do I do? How can I turn my life around?

---
**Edit:** A bit of extra back story here - I'm also a massive procrastinator, like... HUGE. I procrastinated so much during college that if the work wasn't done on the night before or the day it was due, it ended up being late. Often. Sometimes I didn't even finish assignments because of it. I ended up graduating with a 3.1GPA, which isn't terrible, but also nothing to write home about. At the end, I just wanted to graduate to graduate, not because it would help me better myself and increase my job prospects..

I *know* I'm a strong writer, and I *know* I'm a good programmer, and I *know* I can succeed at one or both of these things, but I just don't have the motivation to try. Sigh.

I also take 150mg of Effexor daily for anxiety, and while it is possible I have one or more side effects from the medication, I can assure you that me being on that med is better than being off it. :/ ...or maybe not. Looking at side effects, the med could be causing or exacerbating any of the following issues I suffer from: [somnolence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence), sleepiness, failing memory (I've noticed memory difficulties the last few months or so), fatigue, and trouble concentrating sometimes.

 We get to the end of the month and I call about a few things: repaying them some money they did overpay me and to ask about retroactive payments.

 Turns out that, since I was getting paid one way and it was discovered I could be payed in another way, I do get retroactive payments - but I also have to pay back money I should not have gotten. So - there's no retroactive payment.

 (This was how it was explained to me, kinda beauracratically confusing)

 Also, one means of getting payment overrides another way of getting paid.

 Long story short: I'm back to where I was before getting the ~60% raise... I owe for extra money they shouldn't have given to me and, eventually, I will have to pay them back for the ~60% increase I got recently.

 I would just like to say that the sudden possibility of getting a higher fixed income - to someone who is living month-to-month - is very comforting. Then to have it withdrawn again... Feels like I'm a dog that's being taunted.

I (27, female) have struggled with how to deal with my sister (26). Growing up, our entire family revolved around her. She was in and out of treatment centers and rehab facilities. Weekends involved visiting her wherever she was, family therapy sessions that focused on her, and when she was actually home, the drama that she caused. My mothers entire focus was my sister so I was really left to deal with my own crap. She didn't even ask me where I was going to go to college. I know I have a lot of resentment towards both my mom and sister because of this so it plays a part in how I treat her. 

My sister, after having a child and being clean for a while, has now relapsed. She has been using whatever she could get her hands on. The issue isn't her drug use (to me at least), it's what it does to her brain. She has now been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder after her last hospitalization. She has become more and more delusional. A few years ago she sent me [emails](http://i.imgur.com/nPs7jKg.jpg) from her hospital. This was the first sign of her delusions. Prior to that hospital stay, she had heard voices.

She was let out of her last hospitalization because she lost her insurance, otherwise she would have gone into long term care. Now the timing of this is a big deal because I am currently pregnant with my first baby. I knew I would have to tell her, and I did when I picked her up from the hospital to go home. (She lives in her own apartment.) The thing is, with her delusions getting worse and worse, I am worried she will say something about my baby and I don't know if I would be able to forgive her. 

She has already claimed my father raped her when she was a child. (This is a complete lie and she wrote it all over Facebook, breaking my Dad's heart and straining his own marriage. He has remarried since my parents divorce and has a young step daughter.) She claims our grandfather is her real father. So that would mean my grandfather had an incestuous relationship with my mom. Our grandpa is well off and she says she deserves more money when he passes because she is his daughter. She is demanding DNA tests from everyone. (In the email I showed, she is saying she is pregnant... she wasn't and despite being shown negative tests constantly, she kept believing she was, so DNA tests would be useless.)

[This](http://imgur.com/a/eMvRI#0) is the last conversation I had with her. Maybe I didn't handle it the best way but she constantly borrows money from me and doesn't pay me back. I was getting fed up with it. She even mentions ""my son"" even though we don't know the sex of the baby yet. I'm worried she will say something worse.

I just don't know how to deal with her. I don't know if I can completely ignore her. Can anyone recommend any books on how to deal with mental illness in the family? Or have been in a similar situation? It's just so incredibly frustrating. I just want to shake her and tell her to wake up. Please help. :(

I am a young woman who is currently dog/apartment sitting for my former roommate who is out of town visiting family. the dog is a miniature pinscir and highly intelligent with an even higher amount of energy. He has anxiety due to being the only pet and being left alone all day while his owner (or i) works. 

I care about this dog immensely and i know its not his fault that he has issues, but his bark is so high pitched and loud it triggers instant blood-boiling anger. He barks to go outside and he barks when he sees another dog and he barks when the phone rings etc etc etc. I try positive reinforcement and praise him heavily when he does appropriate behavior. Sometimes though i smack him and use a harsh tone when i cannot control myself.  

His owner bought him a choke chain for walks because he suffocates himself with anything else. When we were waiting for the elevator to go on a walk he barked a couple times and ignored my verbal/postural (body language) warning. He barked again and i instinctively yanked his chain, causing him to yelp(out of fear i hope). My current roommate has boxers so ive had to adjust for appropriate use of force, which i fucked up in this situation. 

Now i feel super guilty about it and he cowers when i move too quickly next to him. I don't want him to fear me and i feel terrible,  like im the abuser stuck in the anger/apology cycle.  Yet i know the next time he has a barking fit my anger will spike. Yesterday was better and today i plan on taking him for a long run and bringing training treats to try and encourage good behavior .... now i just need help for myself. I know what he needs, but i also need to change my behavior. 

Any tips or advice appreciated. All the anger management tips I've.found online are about listening to the other person and communicating- but i have a dog so what do i do?

Took a little road trip from California to Texas to back home in Tennessee. After getting out, going to the gym and growing a beard, my luck with women has changed like crazy. The consensus seems to be that I'm ""hot"". I don't think I'm ugly but I don't see myself as being extraordinarily attractive, but they seem to think otherwise.

So a couple weekends ago I met this girl, friend of a friend, that was in town for the weekend. Found out she's a fetish model/dominatrix. No porn, just does photo shoots for particular fetishes and beats people up at bdsm parties. Instant attraction on both sides, we hook up all weekend (an exception for her, she's never gone straight to hooking up like that before) and she goes back to where she's from. We've been texting and talking and she said she's going to New York soon and asked if I wanted to go.

I do, but here's my problem (which we talked about). I use the GI Bill to go to school, and the monthly living stipend is how I pay my bills. I was planning to go to school this summer because I only get payed when I'm attending school. She thinks I could model or host events like she does. Other women I've talked to have confirmed this opinion. She also said she can introduce me to the right people if I wanted to get into porn. I have no moral qualms with that, it's just a huge roll of the dice financially.

I've gone from one big commitment with the Corps straight into another big commitment with school. I really want to keep going and complete my degree, but I have been feeling like I need a little time to wing it and have an adventure for once in my life. What better way than to travel the country with a hot chick working in the flesh industry? I got to see a lot of places in the Marines but it was always very structured and controlled. I think it would be a really good life experience, but I don't want to have my car towed off for non-payment because I'm stuck in New York or wherever eating ramen to stay alive. There's also the question of how to tell my friends and family I'm sorta disappearing for 3 months and not really saying why. She said she doesn't want to influence me making a bad decision but she would love to scoop me up to ride along for her crazy life.

Right now I'm debating it pretty hard. I'm going to go ahead and register for summer classes since I can drop for a full refund/no penalty pretty close to the start of the summer semester. I'm going to keep talking to her and find out what elements of this whole kinky modeling thing are close to me and test the waters. If it looks like I can support my bills doing this for the summer I'll go for it. If not I'll stick to the plan.

So, is this crazy or should I go for it?

TLDR: Met a fetish model/ dominatrix that truly thinks I can make money in her world, offered to scoop me up and fly me to New York and wherever else and introduce me to people (vs continuing school this summer). I want to but I am concerned about paying the bills and also this is a batshit crazy idea but I kinda want to.

EDIT: Wow lots of responses! Thanks everyone! I'm pretty sure I want to do it. I may actually be going to Florida, not New York, but hey same difference. I will still enroll for summer semester and try to cram my classes (only need 6 hours worth for the $$) into 2 days a week so I have travel flexibility. I am talking to her more about it and she thinks I would have fun, but she expressed the same concern a lot of you have about it being a stigma later in my life. I'm not worried about it. Everyone who's religious enough to care in my family wouldn't go near porn, and everyone else would probably think it's funny. If a serious future partner would make that a deal breaker, they probably don't need to be in my life.

2 Days ago, my mom and dad had a fight about my dads mom moving in with us.
My dads mom is responsible for us being in $120k Debt (by convincing my dad to buy a store which was going under, she knew about it).
My mom paid for 90% of the loan by working 3-4 jobs in the last 6 years, as a CNA (basically wiping peoples asses for 12hours a day), her health is in the gutter right now.

When my dads mom moved in, my mom started making preparations for us (my sister, 8, my brother, 9months, and me) to move back to india.

Theres a school program there for a year-3 years that will let me get a job here and i will be able to come back, im 19 currently.

Now ive been researching a lot in the last few hours and talking with people about getting an apartment somewhere cheep, and i can find a job, i can find one that pays 15-17/hr as a CNA where my mom use to work. I can BARELY be able to make about 28k/year and with a room mate be able to afford living here.

I plan on working on my programing/coding while doing this part time, as well as stand up comedy. I know success is a numbers game and you need to take risks to succeed. I can make anyone laugh, and have very good social skills, and am a very hard worker.

How do I convince her to let me stay here and take a shot at my life?

Last time i tried asking her to let me stay here, she said ""Fine, ill stay here too, we'll get a 1 bed room apartment"". 

Im also going to LPN program right now its a 1 year condensed thing and the most difficult semester is about to come. I cant study AND watch a 9month old baby AND an 8 year old kid at the same time, theres too many distractions and i cant take my eyes off the baby...

I also have a few youtube accounts that make an average of $50/month, and in the future i have big plans that should really help me make at least 100-1k+/month, with better views.
 
Im good with business and stocks, as well as my other previously mentioned plans. I really want to stay here, Im 19 that, that 1 year is a big sacrifice. This bloody LPN program was soupouse to be that 1 year i spend in pain so i can get a decent job to go back to college, im not even half way through and its HELL, i hate getting up in the morning an spending 12hours a day in class or at clinical. If i stay here at least ill be shooting or chasing my dreams..

Any advice will be helpful, please no haters this is very serious.

I am in a conundrum and would love some outside help. 

For the past year I have been an interning for a company I have always dreamed of working for. A few weeks ago, I was offered a permanent position with a really impressive salary offer. 

Sounds great right?  In theory yes, this is a dream come true.

However, accepting this position would mean living another year away from all my family and friends which are all on the west coast. Besides having this awesome job, I have absolutely hated living where I am now. I hate the weather, I find the people rude, and most of all I miss my loved ones. To make matters more complicated, my grandma has terminal cancer and the thought of not being near family now is upsetting. 

So here is my question. What would you do in my situation? Accept the position and deal with living in an area you are not thrilled with? or decline it and hope something (maybe not quite as good) opens up closer to home?",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_1a6vc0,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1a6vc0/need_advice_i_have_been_offered_my_dream_job_with/,

She's a year above me. Took a class with her, she's always been very nice to me. We have a ton of mutual friends. I would consider her more than an acquaintance.

Two months ago, she Facebook chats me asking for help on some science homework. I haven't seen her in a while, but the questions she asks are not very tough and I wanted to see what she has been up to since. We chat a bit and all is good. A week later she messages me again asking for more help. She says that she needs to critique a research paper for her assignment, but she doesn't know anyone in her class. She asks me for my paper, and I oblige. Again all is good.

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. Another girl I knew from high school, let's say Jen, Facebook chats me with a frantic message. We're not close friends, but again, more than acquaintances. She says that she was caught plagiarizing and that her professor failed her for that assignment and she didn't know what to do. Jen says that Angie sold her that paper. At first I didn't want to believe it, so I asked Jen to send me the paper that she bought. Turns out it was mine. I was beyond pissed, but wow this was some serendipity. I told her to come clean with her professor because I knew there was no way she was gonna lie her way out. And after finding out that she took my paper, she did apologize and took the failing grade.

But now, I'm stuck in a rut. I've tried contacting Angie multiple times, through FB, text, calling, tried to contact her boyfriend, etc. She's cut off all connection to me and Jen. We're all from the same city, but I'm currently studying out of state right now and going home would be a huge time commitment that I really cannot afford right now. We have mutual friends, but I don't want to risk their friendship with her at my expense. My last option would be to report her to the her school administration, but I don't have any proof that she used my paper in any of her classes, just that she sold it to someone else. Also, she just transferred this semester to another school, which complicates things further. So what should I do??

1362295393.0,12,self.needadvice,19kfwd,How to deal with an annoying small group situation in a college class. (a bit ranty),13,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/19kfwd/how_to_deal_with_an_annoying_small_group/,"For some background: This is my third year in college, but my second semester at this school (I transferred from a small evangelical liberal arts college to a large state university). I absolutely love my new school and am very happy with my decision to transfer. One of the biggest reasons I transferred is I was tired of the intellectually homogeneous atmosphere at my old college and wanted to meet people who believed different things. So far I have not been disappointed. I like the diversity, wide variety of perspectives, and generally open-minded atmosphere. It is a much better fit for me all around. But a small group situation in one particular class is starting to sour my experience and I'm wondering how to go about handling it.

The class is an ethics class, and I love it so much that I am considering adding a second major in philosophy. Well...I love the lectures, subject matter, and individual assignments. There is one aspect of the class I dread every time I go: my small discussion group. These groups were assigned to us by our professor based on our ""similar interests."" I think he grouped us together because we're all psychology majors. As far as I know, they are permanent for the rest of the semester.

There is one girl in my group that I quite simply cannot stand. At first I respected her because she is intelligent, passionate, and appears to understand the material well, but once I got to know her she started getting on my nerves. She is a very militant antitheist and quite far-left in her politics. I am a recent convert to Catholicism and at a bit of a political impasse (I voted libertarian in the last election, but I've started considering distributism). Normally I do not have a problem with people whose views are different from my own, in fact, I learn a lot from them and they sometimes even change my mind. Three of my closest friends are atheists and many of the people in my social circle at least lean left politically, and as I said before, part of the reason I transferred is I wanted to learn alongside people who have different views. 

But this girl is almost evangelical about her beliefs. She tries to insert them into every discussion we have, regardless of whether they are germane to the topic at hand or not. For instance, in one class our assignment was to come up with a utilitarian dilemma with a clear setting, characters, and problem (e.g., the [trolley problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)) and all she wanted to talk about were overpopulation and environmentalism. She constantly interrupted other members of the group and talked over the professor when he was explaining the assignment, and did not stop when he reprimanded her. We did not end up completing the assignment because she kept derailing the discussion and diverting the group's attention away from what we were supposed to be doing. 

She thinks all theists are idiots and completely rejects everything they have to say. She thought Kant was a moron because he quoted Scripture in his essays, and would not even attempt to take his philosophy seriously just because of that. She loudly scoffs and rolls her eyes whenever the topic of God or religion comes up, whether the professor or a student is talking. I try to dialogue with her, I really do, but she is not interested in dialogue or debate; only in proclaiming her beliefs and shooting down everyone who disagrees. Her attitude is just arrogant and disrespectful all around; she usually comes to class 20 minutes late, if she shows up at all, and is rude to the professor and the other students. She acts like she is an expert in the subject even though she misses most of the lectures.

The other two members of the group aren't much help: one is a guy who seems to have a crush on the girl in question and the other is a shy girl who doesn't contribute much. I have a chronic illness that sometimes impacts my language ability, so my speech is slurred and slow and very easily interrupted. Naturally, this girl dominates the conversation and as a result, discussions are usually pretty unproductive. Our discussions are much more fruitful on the days she doesn't show up.

I'm not exactly sure how to deal with this situation. I've clashed with people in my classes before (I was a would-be Catholic at an evangelical Protestant college; it was kind of a regular occurrence) and I've dealt with less than ideal small group situations. But the last time I've been forced into a small group with someone whose personality was this abrasive to me was middle school. Part of me wants to talk to the professor and request to be assigned to a different group, but I'm afraid that would be over-reacting and immature since she hasn't personally attacked me. But I'm not sure how I'm going to get through this class if I have to deal with this girl constantly for another two months.

The first of my two events this weekend involves my girlfriend of about a year. Our relationship has been deteriorating for quite some time and I have made the decision to leave her and such I am not asking for relationship advice. I was her first in bed and first she ever fell in love with. However as the honeymoon phase passed fighting grew more and more frequent and she has devolved into pure emotional manipulation of me while still trying to tell me she loves me. Regardless of that this saturday after a large fight she was convinced I was breaking up with her (I was the next day but had not told anyone). After a few hours of not hearing from her I get a text from her roommate at college that she was talking about suicide. I go to her and after talking she bounces back to a somewhat normal mood. I keep her with me for the rest of the weekend to watch her while helping host the superbowl party my household was throwing. I have no idea how to get her the help she needs (as her family is...not the most supportive). She is dragging me down, stubborn, a bit deluded, and I fear that any attempt of me to leave her without first getting her help will result in her hurting herself. I understand that some talk of suicide can be a cry for help kind of thing but given her mental health history I feel that it would irresponsible of me to leave her given what I have told you so far.
  
A few hours after dropping her back off at her college I come home to face a completely separate issue. I am now in my mid twenties and there has always been a point of contention between my father and I concerning his drinking (and smoking) to the point where we have had several mild (never came to blows) arguments regarding these habits over the course of my life. I have lived in close proximity to him (close enough to see him on a regular basis) for 5 of the last 6 years. He has always had a drinking problem and been depressed. For many of those years he has either done a good job at hiding it from me or recently it has gotten much worse. Regardless the night of the superbowl I was outside talking to his not-quite-girlfriend but not-quite-fiance about my dad's drinking as he had gotten a bit rowdy that night.  
  
Among other things I was told a story from the christmas a bit over a month prior. Dad had a few beers (and something else) on a night himself and the not-quite-fiance (NQF from here out) attended a christmas party about 15 miles away from here. After the party my father was slurring his speech a bit. Nothing too bad from what I hear, and then proceeds to get on the freeway to drive NQF's friends home and then the two go home themselves. He gets on to the freeway and the something else hits him. 2 minutes of him swerving across multiple lanes as NQF and her friends are yelling, hitting him, trying to get a response despite him being conscious and trying to get him to pull over. He comes to himself, pulls over in a huff and gets out of the car angrily. Of course he is too drunk to stand up and falls into the rightmost lane of traffic. NQF and friends drag him into the passenger seat and she takes a risk and drops off the friends and drives home. From what I have been told by NQF this kind of heavy drinking has been growing more frequent in the year and a half they have been together.  
  
The christmas party story does not end here however. Upon getting home NQF goes inside, rather angry, and waits for my father to come in. After waiting for a few minutes she goes out to find him not in the car but puking around the side of the house. She gets him up and tries to get him inside. Despite her support he collapses in the driveway, hits the hood of the car cracking two ribs and then gets a concussion as he hits the grounds. As the story was told the only thing stopping NQF from getting an ambulance out there was when she came outside with the house phone it was two far from the base and had no signal. My father came to before she was able to get back inside.  
  
Before I continue the rest of events I want to give a picture of what my father is like on a night of normal drinking. He either becomes argumentative and easily angered or severely depressed. Until yesterday I thought that the worst this anger was manifested was a few shouted words and then the rest of the night sulking over what he did.  
  
That night after talking with NQF about Dad's drinking we agreed something had to be done or we would leave before he could drag us down. I went to bed, went to work, and the following afternoon I received a call out of the blue from my mother (parents divorced, still friends) about my father. She recently heard from a friend of my dad's how they were out one night and he was drinking. The night ended in what was arguably sexual assault. This apparently happened a year or two ago but my mom had only heard about it the day before she called me. She also told me of another event. When my mom, my mom's 2 best friends (1 male 1 female) and my father were visiting me back out east a few years back my father pulled a similar stunt. After I flew out to where I was going next they all went out together. My father had a few drinks, then a few more, continued this pattern for awhile and attacked my mom's female friend. Both this attack and the borderline sexual attacks are hard for me to describe. I have few details but both times my father was drunk to the point where he was so uncoordinated he intent was not clear, but the force behind it was. My mom's male friend stayed in the room with my mom and the female friend that night as my father pounded on the door yelling at them to let him in for a few hours.  
  
I want to say about these two events that I am not sure why police were not called for each. I love my dad but if he pulled any shit like that while I was around I would do whatever I needed to in order to stop him hurting anyone around him. I want to think that these events are isolated but from what I have heard and seen I cannot ignore the possibility that this could happen to NQF. She is a wonderful woman and strong-willed. I personally cannot see her having stuck around if anything of this sort happened.  
  
Next thing I want to talk about is my father's health. He is overweight but not obese, has symptoms of jaundice and cirrhosis. His eyes are literally yellow some days. He is suffering severe depression and is on blood pressure medication (he claims this is him being healthy). Lastly he has two dogs. I mention this in addition to his health because though he already has severe depression I think it could potentially lead to him committing suicide if they died while he was in his current state. They are about to turn 15, are in terrible shape, and there is nothing more he loves in the world, myself included.  
  
I have a half-baked plan about getting his family out here to have an intervention and get him into rehab or something that can help, but I have no idea what I am doing. I know I need to do it soon because both myself and NQF have no place to go but I do not think we are safe as long as we are here. There are two guns in the house in a safe only he is able to open and ammunition for each. Though he has never threatened me or laid a finger on me I feel that if this goes wrong myself could honestly be in immediate danger for our lives.  
  
The only steps I have taken to solve either problem at present has been to attend a Narcotics Anonymous meeting yesterday in order to better understand, spoke with NQF about what I am planning, and am driving to my mom about 300 miles from here this weekend so that her and I can plan a bit of this and make contact with some of his friends and family. I have to balance this and the girlfriend with my current life as just recently I got a job. I have little in the way of saved up money so dropping the job and devoting myself to this is out of the questions, especially since if this goes wrong I need to move myself and NQF and quickly.  
  
I am running on caffeine and nicotine at this point. Despite being tired I know I have the willpower to do what needs to be done, even if that is breaking contact and laying low for awhile. My problem is that I have no idea *what* to do beyond this intervention idea, which may or may not work to begin with.

Help?",15,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/17tddi/got_a_bad_performance_review_at_work_30_days_to/,"Hi, first time posting here. I looked around reddit for a specific jobs advice board but couldn't find any, so I'm hoping people here might be able to help out.

My company is a startup that's about 3 years old. They've been very successful, but their process has been in flux since day one. I'm a Project Manager here, been working for 1 year and 1 month. We recently switched from a waterfall-esque process to agile, however it's been difficult because we only have the tech side following this, not the business side. I've asked time and time again if we can get the business side trained and have been shot down. I do my best to explain to them how the process works and why their requests are backlogged, but without everyone being on board with agile I suppose I just come off as a dick.

Some things in my review make sense. Because until literally last month I've been the only PM, I've been incredibly stretched thin monitoring a lot of different projects. This means for like 5-10 different projects, some bugs and feature requests, I'm giving about only 80% of the attention to each that they deserve. In my review they highlighted that they'd rather see me give 100% attention to as many as I can with one or two sliding, then give the partial attention I have.

I immediately suggested if, while I make changes, I send out a daily email with statuses on everything we're working on. They accepted this idea, so I sent my first email out right after. No response yet.

The thing that really blindsided me in my review was a comment on my attitude, that I had zero idea about. They said that I was acting standoffish with people, being testy, and being short. And apparently a large number of people felt this way. I've tried to take as objective a look as I can on my behavior and I have zero idea on how I've come off this way, the only thing I can pinpoint is my desperate attempts to explain to customers (internal, we don't have clients) why their things haven't been worked on and what the delays are. I can only guess that I sounded negative since I was being perceived as taking this as a failure on my part to keep this moving (as opposed to it being a failure within the process).

Anyways, **any advice on how to very visibly show I've changed my attitude and have more attention to detail without outright looking like I'm sucking up?** My immediate thought is, next time I speak to anyone about any bugs or issues or requests, that I do so in person, with a smile on my face, and I say ""these are great observations"" and ""thank you for taking the time to walk me through this"" and ""let me see where this can fit in the backlog and I'll have you an update either today or tomorrow morning"" with an email acknowledgement after that has a time stamp for the conversation. Whenever I go through issues with customers, I ask a lot of questions about how often they use a particular feature or what their current process is. I do this in order to better understand how important this feature is for release and if it should be bumped up... maybe I sound like I don't believe them? Like I'm asking ""ha! You think you need this? Prove it, punk!""

Sorry for the wall of text. I've never gotten a bad review before, and this is the greatest job I've had with some of the best people I've ever met in my entire life. It would be devastating to lose it.

Since people often ask ""what's your Plan B?"" in a crisis, here's my current plan of action:

Plan A: Work to visibly and objectively improve the pain points in my bad performance review before my second review in 30 days is up

Plan B (concurrent with Plan A): Dust off my resume, my LinkedIn, and update my resume as stealthily as possible on all job boards, get in touch with recruiters again, and do a passive job hunt to understand the current market in case I do get fired.

Plan C: Investigate going back to school again (I currently only have a Bachelor's, and I won't lie, it's unrelated to my current position. I earned this position through experience alone, nothing to do with my degree, I'm sure that's hurting me in the eyes of the execs)

Plan D: Pick up more freelance work (I have an art/design hobby) to tide me over.

We each went to school for a while, I got my AA, he still has 3 years left. He hates serving, I excel and I adore it (as much as I can adore working in general of course!).

January of 2012, I approached management where I work and told them I'd like to train to be a manager, and by April of 2012, I was in the training program, unofficially. I have completed 6 management workbooks and cross trained in the kitchen on 6 different stations as well as gone through bartending training. I also landed an interview with the Director of Operations who told me that I am one of his top 2 candidates, but he's just waiting for a store to open up, and he doesn't know when that will be. This company is a Fortune 500 company, one that will offer security, benefits, bonuses and a life for me and my kids that my mother didn't offer me. I am tired of being broke. I am tired of trying to scrounge up some quality of life, I'm tired of taking my anti-depressants that make me so tired all the time. I see opportunity, a way out, a chance to save money and to save my life...



Meanwhile, my husband is dead set on starting a business, which will require him to move over a thousand miles away. The plans for our business idea fell through 2 years ago due to a falling out with our funds, but now he is more motivated than ever to do this, using money from his mother and our entire tax return. He can't start the business without all of our money so I have two options: to stay here, with no money, trying to rely on family and friends to watch my kids so I can work and try and make ends meet (this would be until he started making money which could be 6 months or more), or to take my kids, away from all our family, to move to the snow (which we've never been in) in the middle of winter, to start a small business using all of our money. 



On one hand, I am really frustrated with all the waiting I've been doing on my end for management, but I've confirmed with other managers that if I wait, it will happen. No guarantee as to when, but it will. In this scenario, I am slightly worried about all the hours I'll have to work (at least 60, and that's if I get a store that closes at a reasonable hour, which isn't guaranteed), as well as the job itself to an extent, but it's something I really feel I'd be great at. I've never had a passion for anything specifically, just got great grades, took honors classes, and knew I'd figure it out. My other option is to get back into school and become a teacher. I have about as much interest in being a teacher as being a restaurant manager.



On the other hand, I feel like I should support my husband. He supported me over the past year with what I wanted to do, so I feel like now may be the time for me to step up to the plate and support him, but I have horrible anxiety and am just really afraid of us failing and being stuck in Michigan, and possibly ruining my chances of getting my management job. 

**tl;dr After working really hard to land a management job for almost a year, my husband has now decided to pursue his dream of opening a business, a thousand miles away, using all our money, with or without myself and our two kids and I don't know whether to stay here alone with my kids and let him do his thing or to pick up and just move away with him since my management job doesn't have a timeline...**

My advisor just wants me to do the minimum possible to scrape by with a degree at this point, but the thing is, I don't feel like I can even do a successful defense. Last night, I had a dream where I dropped out of the program, and it was the first time I remembered actually feeling happy in a long time.

I can't blame my advisor at all beyond regretting letting him convince me to stay on when I wanted to drop out initially. It's completely my own failure that caused me to be his most disappointing student so far. But due to our combined unhappiness with my work, I've withdrawn a lot from school activities, friends, etc. If I drop out now, and I'm quite sure I want to do so at this point, I just have no idea how to get my life on track. I don't feel comfortable asking my advisor for a reference and that has to be a huge red flag for anyone hiring. I haven't made any real connections or done work outside of my research. 

What can I do to ""start over""? Right now I feel like no one will want to hire me because of how badly I bungled the past 6 years of my life as a grad student. I feel like I wasted all these years with nothing to show for it. Any topics I learned in undergrad have also faded from my memory, so I feel like I'm worse off than I was when I initially graduated. I don't think I want to get into the issues of my depression with anyone hiring, but I don't know how I can convince anyone to take a chance on me given my track record. 

I still want to go into a related field (I'm in CS/Engineering), as I used to be quite passionate about my work in undergrad. Research just turned out not to be for me and I was too stubborn to give up when the first signs of incompatibility showed up. And now I'm worried that it's too late.

My family is full of religious cunts who don't care about me because they think I'm a failure.

It normally goes for $395 in stores, and the price asked was $190.  So a pretty good deal.  The dude said he was selling it for his girlfriend who needed money to make bail (kind of shady) but he had the password so it seemed legit.

When we got it home, we found short video of a girl smoking a crack pipe on it and both the laptop and the bag it came in had a funny weird chemical/smoky smell.  We immediately turned it off (it was never hooked up to the internet and we didn't do anything other than uninstall some of the factory installed bloatware and view the video).

It's been off, unused for about a week now.  I'd been planning to wipe it down really thoroughly because it smells so bad but hadn't gotten around to it.  Also was somewhat concerned about the crack smoking video but not sure what to do about it.

My husband got a voicemail last night from a girl (presumably the girl who was in jail, according to the seller's story).  She started off by saying she was calling to avoid having to go to the police and press charges.  She knew my husbands cell phone number and his first name (both of which were given to the craigslist seller) and claimed her laptop emailed her the information and she knew he had stole her laptop and wanted it back.

There is no way she could have gotten any personal information from an anti-theft program.  We didn't use the laptop at all, and it was never hooked up to the internet.  Which makes us think that the boyfriend simply gave my husbands info to his girlfriend so she could threaten us and try to scam us.

If she had called and said ""Hey, my ex-boyfriend stole my laptop and I found your info in his email.  I really need it back"" I would feel like maybe this girl was telling the truth and it really was stolen.  But that fact that she had all my husbands info (willingly given by seller) and was calling and threatening us first rather than just reporting it stolen and going to the police, makes me think it is a scam.

She's been diagnosed with depression, borderline personality disorder, and she regularly self-harms. After she came back from the hospital, things seemed to be going okay. 

However, within the last few months, things stopped being okay. Her behavior became increasingly erratic and self-destructive. She wasn't taking her meds because she couldn't afford them (she has a foolish desire to be financially independent from her parents). I couldn't look at her without thinking that something terrible was going to happen, and lo and behold, it did. A month ago she was drinking and cutting, cut extremely deep, and needed to go to the emergency room for stitches. We don't believe she was trying to commit suicide, just that it was a drunken accident. That experience affected me and my other roommates profoundly, and we've done nothing but worry about her since then.

After coming back from the hospital the second time, things again seem to be going okay. She's sober, taking her meds (her parents are paying for them), seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist once a week, and also going to a weekly group therapy for BPD. She says that whenever she gets the urge to self-harm she occupies herself with a project like cleaning the house or something of that nature. However, we don't know how long that's going to last. My roommates and I go to school during the day and fulfill our other obligations, but she's taking the semester off and works the graveyard shift at a pizza place, so she's alone in our house most of the day. We can't supervise her and make sure she's doing the things she needs to be doing, we think she needs more help than what she is currently receiving, and we can't keep worrying about her like this because our own sanities are beginning to erode.

As a result, we have asked her to leave for either home, or a residential treatment community. She has rejected both ideas because she hates her parents, and doesn't think going to a more intensive treatment program will cure her any more than what she's doing now. However, what she's doing now is entirely on her own accord. Just as easily as she's decided to take her meds, say sober, and go to therapy, she can stop doing those things, and no one will be around to know. She admits that when she gets stressed she doesn't want to be sober, and smokes weed heavily instead of drinking. As college students my roommates and I drink alcohol and use substances semi-regularly, which does not create a supportive environment for someone who needs to be sober.

After the second hospitalization her parents visited for the weekend, and we have had many conversations with her mother, all of which have been unproductive. She supports us and is grateful for the help we're trying to provide, but believes that my roommate is an adult who can make her own decisions and we can't force her into doing anything she doesn't want to do.  She believes she is powerless and refuses to step in, despite our pleas for her to do so. While it's true that our friend can make her own decisions, history has proven that she cannot be trusted to make safe and responsible ones at this time.

My roommates and I are stuck. As peers, we have no real power over our friend, and the people who we believe need to step in, won't. We are trying to contact her therapist, but because of privacy laws we would only be able to talk ""at"" her and share our perspective on the situation, and we don't know what effect that will have given her parents' inability to take action. For the time being, as long as she lives here we will continue to feel responsible for her, and that responsibility is something we can no longer bear. It will drive some of us to move out, which will create more stress and fracture our support network.

It's been 10 years and this guy really needs to be remembered. Unfortunately I can't recall his name (I only went for drinks with him twice here in Toronto) but I believe his name was Kenneth McLean. I'll provide as much info as I can, hopefully someone here will have heard of him:

We met on a telnet talker back in 1997 I believe: Eden (then changed to Garden or vice versa, can't remember). His handle was Starmind and I was known as Casaubon back then. Starmind was one of the fucking funniest guys I've ever known and we got along great online. We were both Canadian, he was working at Cornell University at the time and he had also lived/studied in Hamburg, while I was living in Portugal (until 1999 when I moved back to Canada). Kenneth (pretty sure that was his name... after years of referring to him as Starmind back and forth, that's what really stuck in my mind) was born in or around Montreal and he studied nuclear physics I guess, we never talked that much about his academic research.

Kenneth was a big Joy Division fan (among other bands), he was born in the late 50s, I believe, and he had a passion for Sci-Fi. His handle, Starmind, is a reflection of his appreciation for Spider Robinson. He also loved aquariums and fish.

In 2000 or 2001 he came to Toronto to work at the U of T. Thats when I had a chance to meet him in person. Kenneth was a rather large, rotund man. I really wish I had had the opportunity to develop our friendship further. It was a very sad August morning when his mother called me to pass on the tragic news of his death.

If anyone here has heard of Kenneth or can correct some of my misconceptions please contact me. If there is an online memorial or if there are pictures of him that can be shared I would very much like to know. Kenneth was a highly intelligent and kind man and I really believe that his memory should be cherished.

I'll try and sum it up: I'm living in a house with 6 other people, my closest friend here happens to also be a girl I've been in the friend zone with for 2 years now. I've been smoking weed daily for 4 years, and lately have moved on to using harder drugs very often, I think as a form of self medication because I REALLY can't go on living like this. 

The girl knows how I feel about her, and just doesn't feel the same way. I've poured my heart out to her several times, but I've never once even expected her to tell me she felt the same. Its been clear from the start that I had feelings that she didn't.. and now she is back together with her freshmen year boyfriend (long distance, he usually isn't around), yet remains close friends with me despite it fucking with me so much. Part of me wishes I could just walk away from her, end the friendship and everything we have just for my own good, but she's also my closest friend here, and only person who has stayed by me. Also, I live with her, so even if I wanted to do that it really isn't an option. When I first came to school here I was extremely depressed after losing a close friend in a car accident where I was sitting next to him, and she stayed by my side and has been a loyal friend throughout. I've fallen for her, she clearly doesn't feel the same.

I'm also addicted to smoking weed, have been for a long time (since 11th grade of highshool I've smoked daily)... Lately I've also moved to opiates and benzos, which are extremely addictive but seem to be my only solace in live right now. I'm going for a major in physics but my personal life and depression makes it hard to succeed with such a hard major.

Days when I really need to study, something with the girl [or something else] will set me off, and I'll have to go and get high and shit before I can bring myself to work on anything important.

I'm signed into a lease with this person till the end of my what should be my senior year here, but as of right now it looks difficult for me to graduate on time.

I feel completely discouraged, trapped. My only escape feels like using, but that is obviously only making things worse.

I wish the answer was as simple as ""stop using"" but it really isn't. First of all I live in a house where there is ALWAYS someone smoking weed. It should also be noted that my issues didn't start with my drug use, and I really don't think drug use is the root of this shit, it is more so something that I am using to cover up the hurt from other shit (relationship with my that ""friend girl"", crash where my friend died, etc. etc. etc....). I was able to go through 2 years of highschool and 1 year of college as a functioning drug user, getting good grades and shit. It has only been once I started getting really depressed about other shit that my drug use started getting more detrimental and less responsible. Also, I live with that girl I'm still friend-zoned with, and being in that relationship is really difficult. Even if I stopped using, it would do nothing to fix that situation at all.

This doesn't even cover a fraction of the story I feel like, I wish I could convey my current situation better... anyway, I appreciate the help reddit. I feel so fucking fucked.

EDIT: also, periods when I'm away from the girl for a long time (like summer break or something) I usually start to make progress. After awhile I start to get over her and get on with my life, and this summer when I was away from her, for the first time since I met her, I felt almost completely normal and back to myself.

Every time the sun goes down, she becomes unstable and breaks down crying. The overwhelming feeling of helplessness from that night consumes her. It shattered her sense of safety in her surroundings. Whenever she has time to think or reflect, the memory surfaces. She can't even escape this in her sleep, which consist of nightmares left and right. The only way I've seen her fall asleep soundly before her fears get to her is when she passes out out of exhaustion.  

She only has me and her boyfriend to support her. Her boyfriend is doing the best he can do, but it's very frustrating to not be able to help the closest person to you. Playing online games is her main source of distraction from her usual thoughts, but they don't last forever. All I can do is play with her and talk to her throughout the night when the games are over. 

I'm not sure what I can do to help her. 
The darkness triggers her depressed state, but you can't get rid of that. 
I've had her talk to me about whatever she wants, which is usually about her past and her feelings of helplessness and feeling like a burden. Sometimes it helps to talk about the issue, but I'm not sure it's helping her. 
I've attempted to distract her with light conversation, but she can't ignore the nightly thoughts around her.

It's been five years, but still no change or break.

What advice can you give to get me going again? ,16,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/12ha81/i_have_become_constantly_tired_and_unmotivated/,"I see my peers have harder classes, jobs, and in home chores and somehow get it all done with great grades. They seem to balance it all while I can't. I try to do this but it just doesn't seem that I can prioritize as well and that there just isn't enough time. I don't like having low grades of Cs as I am and A and B student. I would like to have more decent grades, at least Bs, not Cs. I would have to do is get my sleep schedule and work priorities worked out.  
  
  
After school I have always come home and taken a nap. In middle school the naps took longer and my parents just attributed it to growing up. This year I am coming home tired and taking the naps again, but they are far to long. My parents are again saying it's because I'm still growing, but I am a senior now I don't have time for naps and should be done with that stuff. I come home around 3:30 and take naps to about 6pm to 8pm. Then I am stuck doing homework until midnight or 1 in the morning. Then I wake up at 6am that morning. This has caused me to spend far more time napping and doing schoolwork than being with my family. I want to no longer take these naps but I can't get a grip on how to do it. I tried this week to not take naps but ended up staying up until midnight anyway and resorted to caffeine to keep me going and now I feel like crap. 
  
  
This is the first step I'd like to overcome to get a grip on my life. Get onto a regular sleeping schedule. How do you keep on your sleep schedule? What is it you end up not doing so you can fit in 8 hours of sleep a day? I cant seem to figure out what homework to put on the side and just deal with getting an F even though I want to get good grades.  
  
  
Also I would like to be more productive with my work (get it done in a faster more timely manner and find a way to actually do all of it.) I am not suffering from senioritis, but my grades have gone from As and some Bs to mostly low Cs. I try but I just can't manage to get work done. It baffles me! I go to school and work great then I go home and the simplest task takes twenty minutes. This takes away time from being with my family and my home chores. I have stopped doing my chores now so I can do my schoolwork and my Mom hasn't complained to me about it, but then there is just so much stuff around the house that needs done but isn't and I see it as my fault and it stresses me out. 
  
  
What do you do to stay motivated, keep a balance of work, family, and chores? How do you decide what tasks you should and shouldn't do to keep this balance and find a core of tasks that are high priority?
  
  
Also I would like to note that getting the good grades and having a sleep schedule has gotten extremely hard after I have had a class III concussion. I was doing OK before, but I have just felt off ever since it happened, which was a month ago. Would that still be affecting me?
  
  
**tl;dr:**
How do you keep a sleep schedule?
What tasks do you give up keep this schedule?
How did you prioritize these tasks?
How do you keep a balance of you work, family, and chores?

I'm 26. I was raised by a single parent with NPD, bipolar disorder and extreme, evangelical religious views. My mom pretty much ticks every box for a ""toxic"" parent: unreliable and at times very frightening, extremely controlling, demanded inappropriate levels of intimacy, believed that constant criticism was the best way to motivate me, etc. etc. etc. 

I found out about 6 months ago that I have ADHD and have in fact had it all my life (was able to get childhood test results that my mother ignored). My ADHD symptoms in particular were something my mother would attack me for. I'm on medication that works wonders and has made me realize how unfair she was and it is stirring up old feelings of grief and anger.

I do see a psychiatrist but he only treats me for ADHD/social anxiety and simply doesn't have the time to offer talk therapy (his services are free).  I can't afford to pay for talk therapy sessions (average rate in my city starts at $100/hour). I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for books/workbooks/websites they think might be helpful for me, or educated advice on how I should respond to my emotions lately. I can't predict when something might trigger me to feel like I'm going to cry these days.

Thanks for reading!  (PS: I am not suicidal or in crisis, no worries on that front).

I'm a 21 year old guy living in Michigan, working retail third shift slightly less than full time and spending my nights off just sitting up all night on my computer. When I was in high school, I always figured I'd go to college immediately afterward, studying Web design as I'd taken some classes on it in high school and enjoyed it. It didn't take long for me to get lazy and bored, though- a few weeks into my general education classes, none of which contained anything I was even vaguely interested in, I just stopped going altogether, mainly due to boredom and the knowledge that, for once, nobody cared if I was in school or not. That was four years ago. Now I've spent the last two years working this job, living first with family and now with friends in an apartment half a mile from the store I work at- I don't have a car, which is another obstacle, but luckily I'm close enough to just walk to and from work. I've spent the past two years just working, nothing else- I had planned to go to college while living with the aforementioned family in a different city, but they ended up moving away, putting the kibosh on that plan. I really, really want to go to college- I want to learn something useful, something that will get me a job that pays more than retail, something that doesn't make me feel like I'm just spinning my wheels here. 

The problem? I don't know what I want to do. *At all.* For the past few years I've thought I want to do something involving computers, since they've always been an interest and hobby of mine, but now even that's starting to change. It's not that I don't want to do anything, either- I look at the list of programs at the local college and think ""yeah, I could probably do that and be relatively happy"" for several of them, mostly involving technology in some way, though not all of them. All I really care about is that whatever I do is tolerable and pays well enough to live on, and I'm able to do it without much difficulty. Things are so open-ended here I don't even know where to start, partly because most of the things I'm interested in, I have zero experience with and just think they sound interesting. I don't know if I want to stick to my original incredibly vague plan of ""something involving computers"" like networking, take a more trade-oriented route like electronic technology, or go another way entirely. I can't help but think maybe my standards are too low- that I'll jump at any low-hanging fruit- but I feel like I have to do *something.*

If someone were to ask me 'think of a happy memory', I'm unable to come up with one. I can think of memories where I would logically have been happy, like meeting my girlfriend or winning awards, but the emotion is unattached, like I'm reading a news report of the event. Rather than remembering what it's like to be happy, there's just a note that says 'was happy'. When going through my own memories, I feel like an archaeologist and not a participant. I can't look at my memories through context, only through the filter of the person I currently am.

Even horrible memories of my childhood, like those regarding my father and our relationship, are absolutely drained of emotion. I can recount tales of terror to people and feel unmoved. It's not hard or difficult, just like I'm telling a story.

Beyond that, I have trouble recalling memories without triggers. They're all kind of jumbled together, and I could recount a story from my past and be unable to tell you if it happened in my senior year of high school or when I was ten years old, without contextual clues, like where I lived at the time. Recounting my memories is entirely involuntary, linked to something someone says or a smell or a film clip or a particular object that is featured in a memory. When I try to do it manually, it's like reaching into an empty bucket.

Except for two instances.

One, my girlfriend was out of town visiting family, and it was my first night alone in the apartment in months. As I was laying in bed, a memory of a fight my parents had when I was young overtook me like I've never known. I felt fear and sorrow like I can't even reach in my daily life, and I sobbed harder than I have since I was a child. Like I was there again. I couldn't escape the memory, it was so vivid. Smells and touches, and little details like the types of stools kept at the counter and the color shirt my sister was wearing, a level of detail I can't achieve normally even when I'm trying. The worst part is I didn't even know I had this memory until that night. I can't even describe the emotion I felt; it was like terror and sorrow and something else all rolled into one, and all I could do was hide in the closet until it went away.

The other time happened just a few weeks ago. It was the same experience, but a different memory.
This is the only time I've ever felt emotion when remembering something, and this particular memory came about of its own choice. What's going on? Is this normal? Or am I just overreacting to standard angst? Am I some sort of hypochondriac? More importantly, is this post in the wrong subreddit?

I try to be as social as possible.  I go out to bars, indie dance clubs, shows, took part in a kick ball league, etc.  I like being around people.  I just don't know how to communicate, add to the group or be part of it.  I feel like I'm just a boring guy and people just get bored of me and stop inviting me out.  It also seems like I communicate better with girls than guys.  I like talking about where we're heading in life and topics along that line rather than last night's sports game. Maybe I'm a downer?

I was just thinking about this last night.  My gf brought me out to a party, and for 7 hrs we drank and played games.  When I wasn't talking to her, I kind of just hung out by myself, being a wall flower.  I talked to some people casually about their recent travels, but after a few minutes I can tell these people want to get out of our conversation right away. I have a hard time making people laugh.  How do you guys do it?  Sometimes my jokes will just go over their heads and one or two will get it.  I just feel ignored and unwanted, but I want to make myself known.

Then I'm also worried about being too boring for my gf.  She admits that she's a boring person as well and not as social, but she was all over the place last night while I just kept to myself.  After the party, we were drunk, and I spilled these insecurities, telling her that I can be clingy but I'm trying not to be and want to give her her space.  She doesn't tell me what I need to do or what I should do, but just says that it seems like if she wasn't at the party that I wouldn't have had a good time at all.  Well, maybe I should try to be better friends with her friends, which brings this back to my original paragraph.

How do I get these people interested in me? How do I get them to want to invite me out? I hung out with them once without my gf around and it seemed like every 5 minutes they were asking me where she was.  That was it for our conversation. I at least sit in their conversations and smile, laugh, and repeat what they say making it seem like I'm interested.  I just don't know how to add to the conversation! It's so frustrating. I'm not as quick in conversations as others.

He has alzheimer's like the title says. I pretty much have the basics down. He's pretty self sufficient in physical terms. What I'm trying to cope with is the stress he tends to cause.

If you haven't cared for someone with a mental illness you'll probably think I'm awful or something. It's a really stressful job. They do a lot of things that don't conform with the normal rules of society and that quickly gets on your nerves. I know it's not his fault and I don't blame him, but it doesn't make it any less annoying.

He does a lot of stuff. Most of it doesn't bother me. Like when he pees on the bathroom floor all the time, puts soap with the tortoise's water, feeds the dogs when he's not supposed to (not his job), turns off the kitchen while I'm cooking or the washing machine while I'm washing some clothes, etc. Meh, it's no big deal. But what really gets me is how often he comes looking for me for no reason at all. It seems to come in bursts. Probably related to anxiety. But when he gets into it, he comes to my room every 5 minutes to ""see if I'm there"". This doesn't seem like a big deal but when you start counting the times it happens into the 3 digits, you start losing it XD

Sometimes he will actually go open the bathroom door while I'm taking a dump more than 6 times to see where I am. I can't ignore him. He just keeps on knocking. He's come to check on me twice while I've been typing this. No reason at all.

I was hoping someone was experienced with alzheimer's patients. These problems are probably common. Maybe there are some techniques to handle them, tricks to make them remember certain rules (don't walk in on people while they're taking a dump! =( ) or some way to ease their anxiety of being alone so they won't look for you so often.

When the Fall Semester started, I was diagnosed Celiac, and began eating Gluten free. However, I did not recover. About mid-way through the semester, it was discovered my gallbladder wasn't working properly and needed to be removed. 

In order to recover and not fail all my classes, I withdrew from my university. I would not be receiving my full amount of payment back, but that was of little concern at this point.

Now: After I recovered, and Spring Semester rolled around, I attempted to apply to college. However, due to issues with transcripts not being sent, I missed the deadline. I was moving across the state, so I had no problem missing a semester of school in order to save up some money and get settled in the new town. 

However, as I began to apply for Summer School at the local colleges, I found out that my first university did NOT withdraw me from the school, despite the fact that I had faxed the paper to them AND called to make sure they got it. They ""do not have it on file"", so what would have been W's on my transcipt are now F's. 

I wasn't the greatest student before, so these have lowered my GPA to the point where I can not attend another University. Fine, I thought, I can go to Community College while I get it sorted out with my first university. 

Of course, nothing is that easy. For the past month, I have been e-mailing and calling different people, each referring me to a different person to attempt to fix my transcript. I finally learned I had to get in touch with the Dean of Engineering in order to get it fixed. However, he has not answered my e-mails, has no phone number listed, and when I call to ask to talk to him, they say to e-mail first. 

ALSO, as I was applying to the community college, everything was going smoothly, they got my transcripts, I talked to the academic advising. However, I still had my Bacterial Meningitis hold on my account, despite having sent them the paper. I called to ask what the hold up was, and they said it would be sorted before it was time for class to start. I called 3 separate times and was told the same thing each time. Low and behold, Friday before registration closes, they call me saying I need to send in another paper. They called around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, which was after I had started work. I told them I would send it in as soon as I got home (11pm) and they told me this was fine, as well.

 Well, Saturday rolls around, and I still have the hold on my account. The school is closed Saturday and Sunday, and Monday (the day registration closed) was Memorial Day, so all the offices at the college were closed.

Now I have to go ANOTHER semester without attending college, which is severely putting my life on hold. My parents(they weren't even OK with me attending a community college (???)), if they find out, will be pulling the little support the provide.

I'm at the end of my rope, every time things have a chance of improving, they end up falling apart again. I have no idea what to do anymore. My parents claimed me as a dependent on their taxes and last year, made enough that I do not qualify for any grants. If they don't help me, I won't be able to afford to go to school.

It’s not just that though. I’m the kinda of person who will keep bad thoughts to myself for fear that people won’t like me for expressing them, or that I’ll hurt someone’s feelings. I’ve never been violent towards anyone in my entire life. I learnt what violence is from a very young age. I knew it was bad, and experiencing it throughout my life has made me the person I am today. I think it’s kinda had the same affect on my little brother as well. If some prick pushes him over he just gets up and walks away (so proud of that).

I really need to change this. It’s gonna be hard though cause every time something comes up, I’ll be afraid that people will think badly of me for it.

I'm a third year university student (on a four year course) in the UK, currently living with another guy and 4 girls. We've been living here now since July of last year, and have been having some problems with the four girls...

While me and the other guy are very clean and tidy, the girls are some of the messiest people I've ever met in my life. Two of the girls, although being messy, are liveable with; they're very friendly and despite being untidy, they're not unclean. It's the other two girls that we have the issue with...

Firstly, they're just not very friendly and hate spending any time in the house. As soon as the semesters finish they go and stay with their parents right away. The worst of the two, Sarah, is the main reason I'm making this post... Just after Christmas, she invited about 70 of her friends round for a birthday party without asking any of us first, and the house got absolutely destroyed. A table got broken, a fridge door got broken off, and my set of plates got smashed... When we told her she needs to repair the damage and replace what was broken, she just cried at us and told us she can't afford to because she's a poor student, despite spending £150 on a bag the week before.

I've asked her multiple times since to replace things, and she just makes up various excuses. As well as this, she's also an incredibly dirty person. It's not just dishes piled up next to the sink, she's done things like leave chicken fillets to defrost in the fridge on top of things, and when I explained the idea of Salmonella to her, and said she needed to put the chicken in a sealed container, she said she would in future, but still doesn't... She also does things like leave her keys in the front door when she comes back late...

I've tried talking to her, I've tried writing her notes, but me and my housemates are just at the end of our collective tether. We really don't know how to approach the situation, and it's making us feel very uncomfortable living here. We realise it's a student house so it's not going to be perfect, but she's never once helped us clean anything, and she just destroys things.

I figured, sure, whatever, he's retired and wants to rent out to have some cash flow.

So yesterday I stopped by my parent's house to get some things and have dinner, the usual I do once every week. My mom seems pretty upset about something - apparently he also got a car. My mom also saw the name of my dad's likely mistress since he (stupidly) put her name on the list of who's covered for insurance on said car.

That's only the tip of the iceberg. A few months back I noticed my dad looking at strange websites. I never bothered to check it out since, well, a man's allowed to look at porn in privacy. Given he could've been a lot more discreet but in any case I didn't want to touch the subject at all. I've been busy since I got a new job last May and moved out last September. Trying to get my life together, etc.

After finding all this out I looked at his browser history and the site/forum he's been frequenting is actually an escort meetup board. I've kept this much info from my mom so far, since I don't know what to do - she's already freaking out that my dad has a mistress, and now potentially he's spending all this money because of hookers. I will probably have to tell her, but I'm already on her side about all this. I some advice - I'm part of a close extended family and since my grandparents are very old my dad has been viewed as the nice, jokester who everybody looks up to, and is pretty much the next head of family.

I'm pretty upset that he's taken advantage of my mom like this and potentially blowing their savings on hookers and whatever, but what should I do as to make sure the family as a whole is not hurt by his actions? I'm thinking I need to confront him with my mom, but I'm really tempted to clock him right now.

",14,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/oktxn/reddit_i_have_this_first_world_problem_and_i_need/,"This is my first submission so I don't know if I'm doing this right, but here goes.


I am in my second semester of college and I am about to move into my dorm today. The reason I chose this university was mainly because my dad passed away while I was in the application process and I wanted to stay close to my mom for emotional support. Plus, my boyfriend was going to be attending this university and it’s a pretty good school. Extra points, I guess. Originally I was planning on going to a university 5 hours away, and I always told myself I’d never base my decision off of somebody else (ie. Mom, boyfriend…) but given the situation it seemed worth to be here for my mom during this time.


So during my first semester I decided to make the 45-minute commute to my university. All was well except the drive was rather tiring and I would end up alone most of the time I was home since my mom works night shifts at the hospital and sleeps during the day. For the most part, this was my reasoning for living on campus this semester. I also felt a little left out that all my friends were out enjoying their college lives while my life has remained unchanged since high school. Since I started college my mom hasn't given me any more freedom, and has been very clingy. For example, she calls me incessantly while I am on campus and if I am not home by 6pm she freaks out. (My latest class ended at 4:30pm last semester so it's hard. Especially during traffic rush hour) I appreciate that she cares, I really do, but I’m 19 now and I also wish she’d loosen the leash a little. I’ve given her no reason not to trust me, but she always pulls the ""You live under my roof, you do as I say"" card.


My decision to live on campus this semester was hard because I know my mom will now be living alone. She doesn’t get out much outside of work or have many friends, so I really don’t know what she’ll do without me when she’s not working. She has even told me that if it weren’t for me she’d have no reason for living. However, after making my decision to live on campus my mom has also told me that she knew my moving out was inevitable and that she understands that she cannot stop time, but she just seems so sad about it and guilt trips me on occasion. 


I feel like a spoiled brat that this is bothering me so much. Woe is me for being able to further my education in exchange for a little extra driving, spending nights alone, and being a “normal” college student. While I’ve had a roof over my head and three square meals every day of my life. Curse me and my first world problems. 

On the other hand, I also don’t feel like I’m such a terrible kid. I make all A’s and B’s, I have my entire tuition paid for without my mom’s help, and I really care about my family. That’s more than a lot of people can say, I suppose. 


So reddit, did I make the right/wrong decision for living on campus this semester? Am I a terrible daughter? I’ve tried weighing out the pros and cons but one doesn’t seem to outweigh the other. I want to make my own decisions and lead my own life, but I also don’t want my mom to be sad and alone. 


TL;DR Dad dies, I decide to stay home and commute to university so my mom is not sad and alone. I decide to live on campus this semester but feel bad that I am leaving my mom sad and alone. I am a spoiled rotten daughter from the depths of hell.  What do?


**Edit: Thanks everyone! After yall's reassurance and actually living on campus for almost a week, I do think I made the right choice. Having an actual place to crash and study between classes is very convenient. My mom calls and we chat briefly every day. Apparently she's been working a lot of overtime and keeping herself busy.

To boot, the dog barks constantly. All day. All night. 2am, 5am, noon, 3pm, 6pm, midnight. Repeat. They keep it outside 24/7. As far as I can determine, it's not even barking *at* anything, just barking ad nauseum. It keeps me awake at night and in the early morning. It's totally ridiculous.

I have spoken to the owner on at least 3 occasions about the behavior, told her flat out that it is unacceptable and suggested that she attempt to take care of the dog. She basically ignores these suggestions and has expressed absolutely no desire to discipline the dog. I'm afraid that if the dog ever escapes its backyard confinement that it will attack someone.

So I contacted animal control, who told me that they can't do anything. Basically the dog has a pretty good setup (food, water, shelter, a decent-sized yard to run around in) and that they can't do anything until an ""incident"" occurs. My roommates and I have called the police on several occasions on the grounds of a noise complaint. They show up, give a warning, and go on their way. No consequences. We even spoke to the ""Quality Of Life Officer"" at the local PD, who told us that they've heard of this family before, and that they've gotten multiple complaints. Not just about the dog, but the family itself (she's a single mother with 6 kids in a small house. They get in physical fights on a weekly basis). Still, they won't do anything to get rid of this vicious dog, knowing full well that they're in violation of several laws regarding it.

I pull the ticket off my car and check it out.  Turns out it was dated yesterday (Monday, Nov 28th) at 8:26 AM!  Remember, there is no street cleaning on Mondays.

So now I'm not sure what to do.  I really don't mind paying as I was, in fact, in violation of the street cleaning laws *today* and I would, of course, pay a ticket for my trespass.  **However, the ticket was dated *yesterday* when there were no street cleaning restrictions in place on my street** so now I am entertaining prospects of fighting this ticket.

My concern is: are the date and time errors on the ticket an obvious mistake (both date and time, really?).   Keep in mind it was only 8:15AM when I got the ticket *today*, so it wasn't just a mistype of the day-of-month.

What are my options?

Basically, my roommate is a slob. I understand that sometimes that's just the luck of the draw and you have to deal with it, so I pretty much tried to let it go and just picked up after him whenever I could. We get inspected randomly at least once a week, so if I don't clean up after him we'd be regularly failing those.

A few weeks ago we agreed to split the cost of a small TV. I have an Xbox that I said he could use, and I also had cable installed, but he wasn't interested in paying for it, so he doesn't watch it, just plays the Xbox. Well, he was constantly leaving the Xbox on all night, turning it on and then never touching it, taking discs out and just throwing them down on the table, and basically treating it all with disrespect. I nicely asked him to be a little more careful several times, but it never helped.

So finally yesterday after yet another time finding it just left running without him anywhere near it, I just decided to put a child lock on the system so only I could use it. He wasn't around at the time and I eventually went to bed. Well come last night around midnight when he got home, I hear him turn it on and immediately begin having a massive temper tantrum. He turns on all the lights even though I'm asleep, begins throwing shit around, making all kinds of noise, slamming stuff, etc. I pretended to just be asleep because I really didn't feel like confronting him in that state.

Come this morning, I've found several games and things of mine just strewn across the room, my alarm clock was set back an hour (good thing it's the weekend), lots of my food was either eaten or thrown away, and the power cable to the TV that we equally paid for is missing.

At this point I'm not really sure what to do. Part of me wants to be blatantly rude like him and throw on all the lights and wake him up, but I'm trying to be the mature adult here. This guy is only 19 and has never lived away from home before, and he's got some serious maturity issues. Since there's no possible way to switch this living arrangement for the next few months, all I want to do is avoid conflict and protect my stuff, but he doesn't seem capable of that.

But if anyone has some time to read and advise, it would be greatly appreciated.

Quick background.. I started dating a girl (lets call her roxane) in 10th grade (we were both 15 at the time.)  The relationship went very well for a couple years, but around the end of senior year (age 18) we were fighting more than not, and too emotionally dependent on one another to break it off.  Our unhealthy relationship turned into an on/off relationship, and finally fizzled at the end of our sophomore year in college.

Since the breakup, my first reaction was complete and utter depression.  After about 3-4 months of that I decided to better myself.  I started hitting the gym daily, bought nice clothes, and focused on school work.  For the first time in my life, I was attractive and interesting, and girls noticed.  I slummed it for a while and probably stuck myself into more girls than I care to admit. (A big difference from 4 years of complete loyalty.)

Now I'm entering my senior year in college, and on the surface everything looks fine.  I have a couple girls into me, one or two of which have dropped the l-bomb a couple times.  I'm in the best shape of my life, I have good friends, and my career is going very well.  Honestly, I had myself thinking I was fine until last month.

It all came to me when I was riding my 'new' vintage bike to campus, listening to music on my phone and wearing rather 'hipster' clothing.  I realized that the person I'd become is the exact person that 18 year old roxane would have wanted as a perfect boyfriend.  I listen to her music, wear the style she liked, even have the personality she used to love.

Though she is a completely different person today, I'm afraid that over the past 2 years I've been subconsciously trying to become the kind of guy that she would have stayed with.  I have not felt love for any girl since, its just sex and entertainment.

So I ask you, brave soul who read through all of this... is it possible that i've subconsciously tried to become a perfect boy for a girl who no longer exists?  Or is it just some huge coincidence that my style and personality have changed in this peculiar way?

TL;DR I loved a girl, broke up with her, now years later i find myself subconsciously trying to be her ideal man",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_ibzog,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ibzog/living_for_my_ex/,

I just realize now that having invested emotionally and sentimentally in such a nut case has fucked up my sentimental life. Here are the main characteristics of the relationship I could remember:

* She was unstable, the relationship was always on the verge of a breakup, no matter how much care I put in it.

* She had deep depression and eating disorders (she always avoided to have dinner or lunch with me).

* She was sometime seemingly loving but subtly conveying that I was not perfect or good enough for her

* She was intellectually devaluing. She belonged to a religious sect and always made me feel like I was missing something by not being part of it (this fucked up my successive relationship with a mildly catholic girl because I became very scared of religious people in general). I now realize how manipulative this was.

* She was escalating physically only to block just before intercourse, we have never had complete sex.

This has created a lot of roadblocks for me to get into a new relationship. From the cognitive point of view, I guess that I just learnt by association that religious girls are going to hurt. I have always been tolerant and open-minded before, but this has forced me into a very closed-mindset. Only now I am beginning to open up my-self again by reconsidering my position under this new understanding.  

I am actually un-learning some cognitive distortion I have learnt in the past; although the fear remains (especially when meeting new girls who present a spiritual side). By the way, you may wonder if I have understood why I was in such a relationship from the beginning. It was neediness, fear of not being worth of a relationship in general. These are all things I've worked on during years.

What are your practical advices to smooth the transition towards a fulfilling sentimental life? How do you assess whether a specific behavior of your SO is abusive and can produce long lasting damage?

1306422945.0,12,self.needadvice,hkpcx,"My mom has schizo-affective disorder, may possibly be off her meds, need some advice.",13,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/hkpcx/my_mom_has_schizoaffective_disorder_may_possibly/,"Hello denizens of r/needadvice, I thought about doing this with a throwaway but decided in all honesty.. what’s the point? I’m not embarrassed and quite frankly I very seriously doubt anyone knows who I am.

Anyways, my mom has schizo-affective disorder and she displays many symptoms all across the schizophrenic spectrum. Sometimes she displays negative symptoms – the inability to speak, catatonia, and her joints locking. Other times she displays some symptoms in the positive spectrum, delusions of grandeur, hearing voices, etc. Obviously I learned quite a bit about the disease through a psychology course that I took, as well as a research paper and speech I had to perform for a class and I decided to do that on schizophrenia. 

I would like to go into the ways that this affected me growing up but I don’t feel that it’s really relevant to the questions I’m about to ask so perhaps that will be another post if there is interest. 

What I’m here to talk about today is the fact that she was fine up until a few years ago after I left home and went to Florida to start my own life. It wasn’t readily apparent that there was anything wrong; she just all of a sudden stopped taking her medicine about a year or so after I left. She had a psychotic break and no one really knows what it was over or about. All we know is that my Dad walked in on her while her joints were locked up and she was rocking back and forth, she apparently was being “raped” by Satan. I can confirm that this behavior has happened before and I never told my dad about it. She had apparently thrown a good deal of her clothes, as well as my father’s out into the yard and then had this episode. After my father assessed the situation and attempted to get her to talk to him and she was not responding he called 911. This began a series of events where my mother feels that my father has betrayed her and is an enemy to her and is desperately trying to get rid of her and get with her sister who was also involved in this situation. 

I believe specifically after this incident and after she was released from a mental health facility the doctors put her on a drug that is not effective for her in the slightest. My dad knew this as well as her sister and they attempted to take her to a doctor to get it changed and apparently my mother tried to jump out of the car so she wouldn’t have to go back. They then took her to another mental health facility and they sort of straightened her out. Unfortunately she has stopped taking her meds again and I don’t really know what to do.  I came back to South Carolina partly because my father could no longer deal with this on his own and the fact that there were just no jobs in Florida at the time and we had to let the apartment go and my girlfriend is staying with some family while we’re trying to get back on our feet (The reason why this wasn't even a consideration for me is because quite frankly, they don’t like me and don’t want me there). 

So, fast forward to today or more recently I should say. My mom has continuously blamed my father for her visits to the mental health facilities, accused him of cheating, abuse, and has also told him that they are no longer married because their marriage was never “real”. She keeps telling me that he is not my father, that I am not his son, and that my real father is a good, kind, and caring man. She has attempted to get me to not eat because Satan had apparently infected the food. She goes through these phases where she is in “testing” which is apparently a Christian thing where she has to do whatever God tells her, sort of like Simon says. The issues with my father escalated to the point where she would not even acknowledge his existence and this has led my father to move out of the house and move into my grandmother’s trailer that was left to me after she passed and one evening when he was visiting she called the police on him for trespassing and domestic abuse and then the next day called the police on him for staying in the trailer without her permission. I didn’t hear it precisely but apparently she was telling the very nice and understanding policeman about the guardian of light and why my father is not allowed up at the house or in the trailer. She essentially wants him gone, and there was even a scare about a gun before I was able to sneak into her room and take all of the ammunition that belongs in the gun cabinet. She still has a gun hidden somewhere- but all of the ammunition is accounted for and the weapon was not loaded. 

The reason why I wrote all of this is because I think I’ve become…. accustomed to some of her erratic behavior to the point where it’s somewhat normal instead of shocking. The police I mentioned before said that she seemed very out of touch with reality and needed to see a doctor ASAP. That was a few weeks ago and she did indeed go see her doctor, though we had quite a bit of difficulty as she would not make the appointment herself and ignored their phone calls when we convinced her counselor that she desperately needed to see the doctor very soon. Her medicine was changed and she’s been on it for about two weeks now, but I know she’s not taking her sleeping pill and I’m not positive that she’s taking the rest of her medicine. I’m starting to believe that the only place for her may be in an institution of some type. I never wanted her to have to go to one but if she’s not taking her medicine and we can’t leave her by herself for a day well, what can we do? I played with the idea of taking her back to Florida with me but both my girlfriend and myself are Pagans and my mother is very devout Christian who had a hissy fit when she found out I’d read Harry Potter. 

We will be decorating our house with a lot of Pagan symbolism and we will also participate in our respective religions and I’m not willing to change this for my mother, so I just think she will not only be uncomfortable but may resort to other measures to “protect” her son. We obviously couldn’t leave her alone during the day and I feel like I have compromised another year and a half of my life staying here with her and taking care of her. You see she is also diabetic and when she has low blood sugar it seems to interact with her shizo-affective disorder and just royally messes things up. Did I mention that she has apparently been starving herself to get “skinny” again? You can’t do that shit as a diabetic and that may have been what caused her to initially stop taking her medicine and other things.. I honestly just don’t know. Another interesting facet to her disease is that she is for some reason able to act completely normal around her psychiatrist and counselor and doesn’t tell them about any of her problems which leads me to believe that she is not getting adequate care. She’s afraid if she tells the truth she’ll be locked up.

I obviously can’t stay here the rest of my life- I will not. My father would be willing to let shit go if she starts treating him like a human being but that’s not going to happen. She cannot stay by herself so I’m starting to think that maybe she really needs to be in an institution if she can’t manage her diseases.

What do you guys think? What can be done? What should be done?

tl;dr My mom has schizo-affective disorder and is possibly not taking her meds. Can't leave her by herself, I don't think she will want to stay with me, and she has has pushed my dad away. Opinions..Advice..?

I started to get real tired of homework, exams, my shitty college house, living with 7 roommates, being away from my family, and just being isolated in the ""campus bubble"".

But now as that time approaches, I'm really scared of the future. Of the unknown. I don't have a job lined up yet, so I'm worried about that. But most of all is my social situation.

I'm sorry to spill my guts like this, but I feel trapped and want some advice and encouragement. Basically, I want to change my life trajectory but am not sure if I can or if it even makes sense to do so.

Let me start with a quick life bio:

I am 33 years old. I graduated with a degree in business in 2002, then worked for 2 years as a financial analyst. I went back to law school, and graduated 5 years ago. I enjoyed law school and have been a practicing attorney since.

I hate every minute of it. The people I deal with are some of the worst people I've ever met -- and then there are the clients (sorry, lawyer joke). Basically, I'm reasonably decent at my job but I don't enjoy it at all. I frequently feel stressed and overwhelmed. In retrospect, I honestly don't know why I went to law school. It just seemed like the kind of thing I should do. People told me I'd be good at it and I have a lot of lawyers in my family, so I just made the easy decision I guess.

I have thought for a long time I want to quit and do something else, but I hit some major walls...like what, exactly, do I want to do? The things I enjoy no one will pay me to do...and a lot of the time I just think everyone hates their job, that's the reality of being an adult. Maybe I need to man up and just do the grind. Money is not my primary motivation -- I can be perfectly happy earning 30k a year.

Not to brag on myself, but because its relevant.  I love history and science, I read many books/blogs/magazines for enjoyment. I'm a good public speaker/charismatic, I'm organized and reasonably intelligent. I'm also lazy, procrastinate, and don't work very well in a group. In school I excelled in basically every subject and I took classes in virtually everything (I had like 180 hours when I finished, I took 21-24 hours a semester and went to summer school). TBH I like everything on an academic level, but I'm less sure what I like on a professional level.

Pros:
- I have no debt. I was on full scholarship for most of law/undergrad and paid off the rest. However, my savings aren't huge, either. If I sell my home I'll probably be only $20k in the black.
- I have no permanent ties that hold me where I live now. My GF supports this (and in fact has begged me to quit for years, she hates what practicing law has done to me.).
- I dug out my old transcripts. This is what I have: I have a GRE score from 01-2004 where I made a 720, 97th percentile. My undergrad GPA was 3.74. My law school class rank was 34/169, GPA 3.46, magna cum laude.  All from top 15 schools.
- Assuming my tests are still valid, I should be able to get into most programs, I hope.
- Financially it would be a sacrifice, but I think I could do it. Socially, people would think I am batshit insane. In terms of my legal career, it would probably seriously set me back if I dropped it for 2+ years then tried to come back.

Cons:
- I'm old. This whole mess reeks of a stereotypical midlife crisis. Could this all just be a general discontent with my life?
- I'm not sure things will be better even if I did do something else. My experience in the world of finance was basically the same as law -- both are nasty, short, and brutish. I'm not sure anything else wouldn't be just as bad.
- And here's the biggy...I don't really know what I want to do, I just don't want what I have. This makes me doubt myself in the whole process.
- Jobs are hard to come by...what if I invest 2+ years tossing my law career out the window and end up another unemployed history major? To be blunt, I'm not sure if I could recover from a setback like that.

So here are my questions for you, reddit:

1.  Do you think this is just an irrational midlife crisis by a washed up lawyer?

2.  If not, how should I go forward? How can I pick a career I won't hate?

3.  What can I do to prepare for going back to school, what resources are available, and so on?

4.  Has anyone experienced something similar to this? What did you do, and how did it turn out?

1298292323.0,10,self.needadvice,fpiuo,The bathrooms at work are really disgusting,17,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/fpiuo/the_bathrooms_at_work_are_really_disgusting/,"This is going to be long but it needs explaining. 

I'm using a throwaway because I don't want to get fired and coworkers know my account on here. 

**Some Set-Up**

I work in a factory setting that deals with important documents that could be used for identity theft. For this reason cellphones, cameras, computers and even thumb drives are not allowed. 

There are a lot of people on my shift in the building I work. I'd guess somewhere around two hundred and it runs twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. It is a large, worldwide company that deals with more than what my building does. This place actively practices equal opportunity employees. I have been exposed to many new cultures by my coworkers alone. 

**The Bathrooms**

The bathrooms at work are absolutely filthy. There is often poop on (not in) the toilets, the toilets unflushed and piled with shit, piss, toilet paper, and Mysterious Liquids. Toilet Paper is strewn about and there is water around and on the toilet, and on the stall walls. It looks almost like someone was cupping water from the toilet and splashing it about. More than once I have found a bloody tampon on the floor by the toilet. Not in the empty little boxes that is there for the purpose. 

**The Cause**

As I said there are a lot of people from all walks of life, all races and creeds. I'm really glad for this because it is really interesting to talk to someone with such a different life than what you can wrap your mind around. 

The problem is that most of my building (I would safely say half of the people on any shift with people of all the other races making up the other half) consists of Africans. Not illegals, mind you (that I know of) but people with green cards or newly immigrated. People who came from underdeveloped countries. 

And it is this group that is mainly responsible for the disgusting bathrooms. A good chunk of them probably are not but a good majority is. Let me explain before anyone calls me racist. 

* They don't bathe often if at all. At least not properly. There is a strong smell of BO overlayed by a lot of cologne or perfume. 
* When they do bathe, it is in the bathrooms at work. I, and many others, have borne witness to some of them washing their feet, private areas, and hair in the sinks, water fountains, and toilets. 
* There is a section that employs exclusively Africans and they have a mass break an hour before everyone else. If you go into the bathrooms before their lunch, the bathrooms look clean enough. After their mass break is when the bathrooms look like the shitacolypse. 
* They also do not seem to like washing their hands and as I've seen piles in the toilets without toilet paper, they're not too fond of wiping either. 

This is gross and a lot of my coworkers complain about it, know who is doing it, but they don't want to say anything so as to seem racist. 

I have talked with my Supervisor who used to run that aforementioned section and he agrees and sees the problem. However, he's pretty much powerless to do anything about it. We went and talked to his manager who says he'll 'talk to them' but that was months ago and there's really no change. 

There's no way to enforce complete cleanliness unless who had a guard who stood in every bathroom and made sure everyone cleaned up after themselves and didn't wash anything but their hands and occasionally face in the sink. I can't accuse people by name because often I don't bother remembering the person as I'm trying to block out the vision before me and figure out the closest and cleanest bathroom. 

I can't have cameras or videotape to record it for proof and none of my coworkers will speak up because they're scared they will get fired. 

I'm at a loss, Reddit. I'm slightly germaphobic and this only makes it worse. There are only so many places to pee and I'm always scared I'll contract something. I know a guy who works with us (not one of the offending parties) who has HIV. I don't want to get something like that. I want it to stop but I have no idea how. I've got no proof and with nobody to back me up, no witnesses. 

I need this job and other than that it is a really great place to work. 

**TL;DR People from underdeveloped countries make the bathrooms a hazardous wasteland and I don't know how to stop it.**

Since I started college I've had memory issues(always had some, somewhat, but now it's getting worse), and while I used to get excellent grades in high school, I now am barely passing my classes(and having to retake several). I've always had ""numbed"" emotions, people often comment on how its hard to get a response out of me, and I come off as very cold and mean sometimes, though I don't mean to.

My first year in college, I drank a lot, though I was always receptive to meeting new people but lasting friends and relationships never formed for me. I ended up burning the bridges I did make since then by not putting an effort in to meet my obligations to people.

Do I even mention this to my parents?",14,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/efy1o/was_just_diagnosed_with_generalized_anxiety/,"I found out today that I've probably been suffering from GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) for the last ten years, since puberty. It's in conjunction with seasonal affective disorder (winter depression) and before that, major depression (two suicide attempts in high school). 

The therapist, about halfway in, suddenly asked if I would let him predict the kind of family I grew up in, and he nailed it on the head. Very strict household with a dominant mother figure who can be overbearing even to her adult children. (He got a bunch of other details right, none of which are terribly relevant to this.) He's now telling me that my upbringing is essentially the reason I hate myself and worry constantly that I'm going to fuck up - and I'm afraid he might be right.

My parents know about the depression - I was in high school when it happened, and they made sure I got treatment. They've always commented that I don't do well with stress and tend to ""freak out"" at a relatively low threshold, so I don't think they'd be terribly shocked to hear the diagnosis - but I don't know that I want to even mention it because of its roots.


**tl;dr** I'm an anxious mess and my parents apparently caused it. Do I even say anything to them?



**EDIT:** I ask for one very pertinent reason. I'm getting married in a few months. I (and my fiance) are overworked grad students and don't have time or money to plan the wedding. My parents insisted on paying, and my mom is ""helping"" - and, in the process, stressing me out even more. I know that if I told them about the anxiety, they'd ease up a bit... but the second question would be ""when did this start"" and ""do you know what caused it?""

So no, it's not just a question of ""do I rub it in their faces."" It's a serious problem I'm trying to weigh. I don't want to hurt my parents, but they drive me absolutely insane.

1290983156.0,11,self.needadvice,ed0kv,25 year old virgin seeking advice,16,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ed0kv/25_year_old_virgin_seeking_advice/,"Ok, so before you start hating on me or calling me a nerd, yes, I accept that being 25 years old as a male and still a virgin is unusual. I'm not claiming different. I just was hoping for some advice from reddit, since the community that I've witnessed over the past few months seems very friendly and helpful.

My story is as follows:

During my teenage years I was popular (or popular enough) in high school, went on dates, have done various activities with girls and such, but I would always decline moving on to that last step. I didn't want to lose my virginity before I was married because that was a very important religious edict that my parents had tried to instill in me. However, as I've grown older, I now realize that it doesn't matter nearly as much as I thought it did. Unfortunately, it seems as though I'm out of my league now.

I'm 25, and am still in college. At the age of 19, I was diagnosed with severe chronic ulcerative colitis, and after five surgeries over the past six years as well as spending nearly 14 months in a hospital room during this time for recovery or surgery preparation, I no longer know how to function in society. I feel at a loss. I suppose it would be something akin to someone who is in prison and then released. I only know how to function inside of hospitals, and find everything else confusing. I had to adapt my lifestyle, and now that I no longer am having issues with my disease (well, not horrible issues, anyway), I'm left with a life to make for myself and an education to pursue.

My question for advice is to what I can do to help myself assimilate into society better? I've always been introverted in nature, and accept that. I don't have a problem making friends if I try to make myself go out, but I still feel like the odd man out at everything I attend. Most of the classes I'm in are filled with 18 or 19 year olds, and while there isn't a huge gap in age, it's enough that I feel like I can't relate anymore. I feel awkward and alone in this, though I know I'm not. I'm sure there are plenty of people that are in my exact position, so maybe I'm hoping to hear from them and see how they were able to cope or transition back into a regular life. Obviously I find it kind of difficult approaching girls in the environment I encounter them the most in (school), simply because I just ‘feel’ so much older than them, even if I’m not. There’s also a maturity gap that has arisen, as I’m looking for more long-term relationships instead of the flings that seem to regularly occur.

I’m not looking to just jump into a relationship or gunning for losing my virginity. I still want to lose it in a controlled environment, with a girl I truly care for. But I need help finding that girl. I feel out of my element, so maybe I need a different environment to pursue relationships in. Where should I head instead of searching in classes? Or should I still pursue in the school environment? What sort of tactics should I employ instead? I’ve tried online dating sites to try to help alleviate the pressure of searching, but to no apparent avail. If I posted pictures on here to set the mind frame would that help? Please don’t suggest parties, things like that. It isn’t that I can’t handle that kind of environment, but I prefer something different instead. 

tl;dr – I’m 25 and a virgin, but mostly because of medical reasons. I’ve been out of the game for too long, and don’t know what the hell I’m doing. Help!

edit: Thanks everyone for your helpful comments. I guess my question was really more about how do I get out of the mindset of being sick than worrying about being a virgin. It's just one of the larger concerns, and people seem to notice it more if mentioned. I can't thank you all enough for the advice thus far, and look forward to more if people want to lend it.

It was from my Dad's (died five years ago) bank. They were writing to tell me, as a secondary beneficiary, that my Mom had spent so much of the money Dad left her in trust, that she'd be destitute in five years at her current rate of spending. 

My Mom supports my 42 year old brother and his family, as well as my 40 year old alcoholic sister. This means they have their own credit cards, no bills, their children dress from Old Navy, there is a flat screen tv blaring in every room, my sister lives rent free in a $200,000 house mom bought her, and my brother and his family live in luxury in my Mom's house. 

I'm the youngest by many years. I take no money from my mom; never offered any. I stay home for now, raising my two babies. We make due on my husband's $30,000 a year salary. We are happy and lack for no essentials, but we live within our means, which pretty much equals well...sorta poor. Nothing as nice as the rest of my family. My brother and mother believe he deserves this lifestyle and money, because he and his wife ""take care"" of Mom. Mom is lazy and forgetful but entirely able-bodied.

The bank wants me to sign a paper saying I want them to keep giving my mother all the money she asks for, which is around $120,000 a year, to support the rest of my family in the manner to which they are accustommed, while acknowledging I fully understand this will leave my mother destitute.  

When I talk to mom about this, she is in complete denial and has no concept of the situation. She wants me to be quiet. She suggested draining the hottub to save money, and has no other plans for extending her money. If I broach my siblings with it, they will attack in defensive rage. They're not very fond of me, because, as they say, college made me arrogant. 

I don't want to sign that paper. I want them to stop spending the money my dad worked so hard for. I want (even though I know I'm not really entitled to it) some inheritence to put my kids through college, but my brother and sister spent it all.

This is an issue I'm trying to resolve as quickly as I can. We have exactly thirty-seven cents in the bank.

Our plan was to use those last paychecks to pay for a studio at [Value Place](http://www.valueplace.com), until the new job and paychecks kick in, which would leave enough for food and other minor expenses.

My family has offered to pay for this week, but after that, it's up to us.

Now for my actual request. I'm in Shreveport, La., and I haven't lived here for 10 years. I've been looking online for any kind of resource for assistance. I'm sure there are plenty of places, but we're in Bossier and most everything is in S'port. We also have no car and have been using the bus to take car of things.

Spare me the abortion, adoption and condom advice I don’t need it. I’m an adult and I made my own decisions. I love my son he’s the greatest thing in the world and I wouldn’t change that for anything.
History
My girlfriend (not married mistake #1) and I recently had a baby (He’s 3 months old now). While she was pregnant she decided on not returning to work after our boy was born (probably a dumb idea looking back now). She wanted to stay home with him for a year or so to help with his development, she did a bunch of research and thinks that’s best for him. That very well may be the case if you could she could handle the stress.  The past three months have been basically hell. I’ve been stuck paying the bill for everything since she has no job or money now (she has some money but it’s for her car insurance and bills). This part doesn’t really bother me because I was prepared for it. Her attitude about her situation however is terrible. She never thinks I do anything to help her and the baby (I buy all the food for us, all his formula, all his clothes, all the rent, utilities ECT you name it I’m paying for it). When I return home from work (I work in IT making a pretty good salary) I’m there help take care of our son, cook dinner, wash bottles, do dishes, give her a break by watching our son and entertaining him, giving him bottles ect. Basically I’m doing all I possibly can when I get home. I have no social life now (I expected that), I hardly play video games anymore unless he’s sleeping for the night. The only time I go out is to buy food or things for us.
To top all of this off our son is colicky so there are days when he’s very difficult to deal with. My girl friend has always been a high stress / high anxiety person. She’s never had a good coping mechanism to deal with problem. When our son is getting into a fit she quickly escalates and gets very anxious and stressed out. This causes her to get headaches (which she complains about all day) this makes her think unclearly which affects her energy levels and judgment. When our son is in a fit he needs constant attention and soothing. When she’s stressed that’s the last thing she wants to do so that further gets my son all worked up. So while I’m at work all I hear all day over text is how hard he’s being today and how she can’t take it anymore. When I return home I calmly rock my son to sleep within minutes and she gets angry at me for several reasons (if he sleeps too much during the day he will wake up at night, why can you get him to calm down so fast that’s not fair). Well I believe that my son needs to get what he wants and if he’s tired he’s going to be cranky. Keeping him up is not the proper way to be dealing with this. I say let him take naps throughout the day, he’s more enjoyable when he’s rested. If he wakes up during the night so be it. Take a nap when he does (that’s what other mothers do). She says she’s unable to do this because she can’t take naps during the  day(she’s to stressed to sleep, last night she stayed up till 3 am; I had our son sleeping in bed at 9:30 and he slept till 7 am this morning).

She’s been living with me since our son was born so that’s taking adjustment as well. A few weeks ago my friend and I moved all her remaining stuff into my apartment while she was at her Grandmas. She must have forgotten her diary was on the table in the living room. As my friend and I were bringing in stuff he noticed it (it was open to the last day she wrote it in just laying on our coffee table). He said what’s this and started reading the page aloud (it said some pretty hurtful things about me). After the move I decided to read the entire thing. She started writing in it soon after we got home from the hospital. For the most part it was all stuff she already told me (which I suspected so I never bothered to ever hunt her diary down because I didn’t really care) then I got to a passage that basically said she was going to leave me but was unable to because she found out she was pregnant. She also made mention that she’s unhappy with her life and I’m trying to control her (all I’m doing is giving her advice on things I think she needs to do). Such as finding a daycare center for our son (to give her a break during the day), find a job (so she has money), join a mother support group (so she can make friends; she has like one friend who constantly backs out on plans with her).

As the days go on we get into more and more arguments over things. Usually these arguments are related to trust issues she has with me. Somehow she things I’m cheating on her or I don’t like her (I’m at home with her and our son 24/7 or at work) I’ve never cheated on her but she treats me like I do. She treated me like this before she found out she was pregnant as well. Granted we get into fights often (nothing physical) but it’s because I love her and I’m concerned for her. Not a single week goes by that she doesn’t tell me she hates her life and she wishes she was dead (I don’t really think she would harm herself but I could be wrong).

So Reddit that’s my situation in a nutshell. I’m sure I’ve left things out but here are some questions I need help answering.
More info
1.	Right now she has no health coverage and I’m unable to put her on my plan until she’s living with me for 6 months.
2.	She’s very difficult to live with. She’s constantly (sad, upset, depressed, overly emotional, worn out, thinks nobody likes her, refuses to socialize with people ect) take your pick
3.	We have no family living close by so having a mother or father come and help isn’t an option.
4.	She doesn’t want someone else (a baby sitter) watching our son.
My Options
1.	What can I do to get her help? I believe she needs to talk to a therapist or something. I’m not sure she has post partum depression. She probably does but she was depressed before our son was ever conceived. Even getting her to see one will be a problem because she believes it won’t help her. She also refuses to take medication because she’s afraid she will get addicted and it will change her.
2.	With her having no health coverage what are my options for help (she is applying for Medicaid today but I believe my salary disqualifiers her so we will see)? Do I just have to pay out of my own pocket now? I really want to keep my expenses in check. Right now I have my sights focused on saving up for a house for my son and hopefully (girlfriend to be married if things improve between us)
3.	Should I just tell her enough is enough you have to find a day care center and a job within (some time table) or I’m going to have to ask you to leave (she will likely have to fight for section 8 housing or live with her grandma since she has no income if it comes down to this; she does not like her Grandma). We will then possibly have a custody battle if I feel like going down that path or just submitting to joint custody and pay a huge amount of child support.
4.	Any other options I’ve overlooking?
Things that upset me about the situation
1.	I’m trying to do everything I can. I get her whatever she wants within reason (she was still hungry one time so I let her eat my T-bone steak as well (she had her own); she always demands the biggest piece of meat or most food. If she feels like she’s not getting the most she makes the entire day for me terrible)
2.	As a Dad my rights are shit on all over by the heavily biased court system. If I can prove she’s an unstable person, with no income and house I’d still probably lose custody or have joint custody and have to pay child support (I could afford day care and all my bills on my salary alone (only owe 2,000 dollars on credit cards which will be paid off within months)
3.	I don’t really want to take my son away from her. I believe having a good mother and father is very important for a childs development. But I also don’t like the fact that she could get like 800 – 1000 dollars a month from me to sit around at her grandmas (when it certainly doesn’t cost that much to take care of a baby. I’ve only been spending around 200 a month for his food and clothes give or take. Taking care of my girlfriend actually costs more money then he does)
4.	She decided to keep the child with no consideration for my feelings on the situation. Personally I’m ready for the reasonability but back then I knew she was not (just like she’s proven). She doesn’t believe in abortion and I can respect that but she could have put him up for adoption.
5.	I really get the impression she doesn’t want to be with, she hates her life and she doesn’t want to be a mother. That tears me up inside because I love my son and I know if we fight for custody I’d get the short end of the stick.

I love her more than anything, but over the weekend her grandmother re-wrote her will so that she and her uncle will be splitting her multi-million dollar estate.  She also let me know that she'll be getting a trust fund when we get married. 

To give a bit of background, I grew up poor. Dirt poor. Living out of the back of a yellow Datsun 210 with mom mom and two siblings poor.  I pulled myself up by the bootstraps and completed some college before tuition increases forced me to drop out. Afterwards, I worked for 7 years to get to the point where I could re-enroll.  This May, I'm going to get my degree in economics.  Last May, my fiancee got  her dual engineering degrees. We got engaged in February, and the engagement ring I got her was the best I could afford, but It looked dull and puny next to the diamond ring her grandmother gave her  when she graduated HS.  

All of this really just seems like right as I was about to beat the video game of life on the hard difficulty settings, she just came along and turned on all the cheat codes. What should I tell her to do? Am I out of line for saying I think we should do all we can to forgo (by which I mean just stash it away for emergencies, but otherwise pretend it doesn't exist) it and just live off what we'll make (between the two of us, we'll easily clear 135k/year without any help)?

-Gain weight/Work out/Exercise

-Quit smoking cigarettes

-Pick up the guitar again

-Change my clothing/hair style

-Become interested in more things

-Be a better person to talk to at social gatherings.

-Be more focused during my courses

-Stop being lazy about things

-Stop being so quiet/Or learn how to deal with being a quite type

-Be more confident, and show it


I seem to always fall into my own traps. Every girl I've been with or interested in has either been a little weird, or has baggage. I don't know how I end up doing this, but I want it to stop. I don't want to start becoming a pickup artist. I want to be a more confident person that people can be attracted to after getting to know me or hearing me speak for 5 seconds. I also want to find a girl I can be happy with. But that will have to wait.

I realized, after this past failure with a baggage-carrying girl, that I need a complete overhaul of my life. I want a complete change. New clothes, new hair, new activities, pretty much anything new and different. I also realized that for me to change, I need some time away from things that could deter me from that, i.e. trying to flirt with women, getting too lazy, talking to this girl I just mentioned. This is going to be a long project of mine, which I'm expecting to work on all throughout this first semester of classes. I'm willing to deal with  if it means that I'll be more comfortable and confident about myself for the remainder of my life.

I've always been really skinny, and I'm very uncomfortable with it. Not because it affects my self esteem, but because I'm tired of it. I've also always been lazy, and an introverted person. I want these to change. I am a hopeless romantic, who always ruins my chances with women by not knowing what the right thing to say is, smothering them, or creeping them out. Change, change, change.

I need to know how to stop being a people pleaser, a doormat, a ""nice guy"", a boring guy, and everything else that just makes me uninteresting. I need to also stop thinking about how awkward I am, or what I can do in certain situations. I want to become more fluid with my thoughts and actions, which will make me appear more confident.

My guitar has been missing a string for about 3 months, and I haven't gotten off my lazy ass to go to Guitar Center and get some new ones. This is the tip of a very big iceberg: My inability to get up and do things. I'll sit in my bed, not wanting to get up, because I'm either thinking of how lame the day is going to be or regretting something I did in the past. Lately, this has been going tenfold ever since I ended a thing I had with the only girl I've actually tried to date, without simply waiting for something to happen. How can I get myself out of my bed or couch, and convince myself to get shit done and kick the day's ass? How can I convince myself to go grocery shopping, clean apartment, or take a goddamn shower?

My main goal out of all of this is to improve myself, for myself. After that, I can start living my new, more confident and happy life. I am, however, by no means a loser. I have friends how care about me, and have been told that I am one of the few most genuine people that anyone has ever met. If only they knew how troubled I was in my own head..

What I ask from all of you is to simply give me advice. Tell me your hobbies, and how you started them. Tell me your stories of improving yourself for yourself. Give me good diet plans to gain weight, or good ways to exercise and build muscle. Pretty much give me any advice that would pertain to anything I've written about in this post.

TL;DR: Fuck you, either read this or get out. This is the most important decision I've made in my life, and if you can't help me by reading it, you don't deserve to.

EDIT: I'm into music (mainly classic/alternative rock), I like drinking and smoking weed (AKA having fun while I'm in college), I'm pretty into space, and anthropology, yet I am a Psychology major (And it seems that it's too late to switch again. I might as well wait to get my masters in something I really like).

I have never wronged my girlfriend outside a few normal petty arguements that we always resolve quickly.

Her mom has said that she curses the day her daughter met me.
I try my best to be nice and not say anything but it's getting to be a little much.

Fun story time! This happened a while back. Her mom calls my phone up because my girlfriend doesn't have one. That's fine so she talks  to my g/f for a bit and learns that one of our friends is hanging out with us. So for some reason she wanted to talk to our friend. They had a short conversation and the call is over. Apparently she was trying to convince our friend to get my g/f to break up with me. Our friend was more than a little confused as to why she would want that.

I don't know what it is I have done to this women that has her so upset. I may not be prince charming but I think overall I'm a pretty pleasent person.

I could probably go on for hours but I'll try to keep it short.

Her mom is a recovering alcoholic. She just recently had to go into rehab and I guess now if she drinks again it will kill her.
She is also very manipulative. I have personally witnessed her lying about the dumbest things to try an make me look bad. Even when confronted face to face about something she has lied about she wont budge. She sticks with the lie no matter what.

I thought that now she is clean and is going to support groups that things would get a little better.

Now it just appears she has changed her game. She used to be really mean to my g/f too but now she is trying to get all cozy with her. It's great that she seems to want to get along with her daughter now but I think she is really just trying to dig in so she can better try an convince her that she should dump me.

That might sound a bit paranoid but I really think that is the case. I have seen her try and do exactly this many time but on a lesser scale. I feel so bad for my g/f because she has had to put up with so much abuse her entire life and she just wants to be loved and accepted by her family. Every time her mom starts being nice to her she gets so happy and it hurts to know that it's not going to last.

She has played her little game of trying to nice mommy before.
I actually told my g/f one time that she shouldn't get her hopes up because given a weeks time she will go right back to being a bitch. She didn't like hearing it but I ended up being right.

I've gone on to long as it is. There is so much more context but it would take forever to explain clearly. I don't know how to handle this situation anymore. Should I just keep on trying to ignore her? I feel that if I try to stand up for myself she will just twist my words and try to make me look like the bad guy to everyone she knows. Help? I'm lost.

Background:

My housemate was dismissed from her job for misusing her discount card. She worked at a TK Maxx as a part time sales assistant. She was not working on the day the incident happened, but was out shopping with her mum. She used her staff discount card to buy her mum a dress. Its a 10% staff discount so the dress was purchased for £18 instead of £20.

She was called in for a disciplinary for this, and dismissed for gross misconduct. According to her contract she was told, this is an abuse of the staff discount program as you can only use the discount for yourself.

This was about 2 months ago and she has since moved on and found a new part time job. She had wanted to leave TK Maxx anyway as she did not enjoy working there, so wasn't too bothered about the dismissal. I found this to be a very petty reason for a dismissal, but I know what retail can be like so didn't really think anymore of it:

TL:DR The question:

She has now received a letter from a law company advising her of a civil case agaisnt her. They want settlement of £170, which covers the cost of the ""stolen"" item, and administrative and management fees that were incurred by the process of sacking her.

Surely this is unfair, what can she do? Should she challenge it, and hope they drop it? This is all over a £2 discount. Remember this is in the UK!

*I have found the following useful information online so far. There is a whole subforum devoted to the legal company who have sent the letter, due to their continued mispractice:*

The economy went south so they let everyone go. 

Now a year later she has good clients, good work, and the jobs she gets are well-paying. She's also doing one speculative job at low cost that could turn out to be a career-maker. At the very least it's getting her a lot of experience as a business owner and project manager.

Where it gets tough is the high-paying ID jobs get spread over months, so we don't get all the money up front. She also does construction drawings which have a shorter turnaround, but that's not her main focus.

When we started out we probably had a more optimistic view of how things were going to go. We financed all her startup costs with cash and credit cards. We don't yet have the income to replace what she made in her job, plus we have a number of new credit card bills. To top it all off, we had a baby 1 1/2 years ago and another one a couple months ago. Double day care costs for two kids in diapers is not cheap.

We've managed to struggle along all this time, but we've come to the end of our rope. We now have to start paying our bills and credit card payments with credit cards, or default on our mortgage. We are going to go this week to see about an SBA loan, but will that help us? We would like to pay off everything we've put on credit, plus have operating cash and be able to pay our bills.

**TL/DR** Started business, running out of money as it starts to take off, can't pay bills anymore. Need advice.

Any advice at all is desperately needed. This business is a success and will end up making a lot of money - we just need to get through this dark time somehow.

Here's the story: A friend of mine, lets call her Erica, has had her share of bad relationships in the past. Recently (about 6 months ago), she got together with a guy, lets call him Stan, and after a few months decided that Stan wasn't right for her, so she left him. Stan was pretty broken hearted, and made a big scene in public the day they broke up, calling her names loudly etc.

Fast forward to a couple days ago. I notice Erica is pretty scarce on the internets (she's usually on almost everyday, and I talk to her on Facebook, msn etc) and she hasn't been calling either. I text her to ask her if everything is ok, and she tell's me that she got back together with Stan.

I ask her why, because I know that she didn't like him any more and it's unlikely that she would get back together with him, and she then tells me that Stan obtained some pics of her and her ex-boyfriend (Who she was with before Stan), and threatened her to send them to everyone she knows and basically ruin her life if she doesn't be his girlfriend. He says that someone 'anonymously emailed them to him', but I don't buy that. She agreed to be with him hoping that she could probably get a chance to delete the pictures or convince him to delete them.

This guy is a complete nutcase, and is holding basically keeping her in a relationship under duress. She doesn't want to be with him, but she doesn't want her life ruined by him sending her pics of her having sex with her ex-bf (not even him!) to all her friends and family. I'd like to help her out, but I honestly feel like this guy is holding all the trump cards, and there isn't much Erica or I, or anyone else can do until he decides to let her go, or delete the pictures.

tl;dr: My friend's psycho ex-bf threatened to send nudes of her to her friends and family if she doesn't get back together with him, and she is now in a relationship she doesn't want to be in, and can't leave because he will ruin her life.

Perhaps I should preface this with a bit about my past. When I was 14 my older brother died. When I was 15 my uncle died. When I was 16 my Grandmother died. When I was 19 someone died accidentally on the hood of my car, no, I didn't hit him, but I was in another car that was towing him on a sled; I ran out to help him and there was blood pouring out of his mouth onto my hands. This was 15 years ago. 

I've thought of writing one of these for a long time, but I've put it off, like everything else in my life. I suppose I'm afraid of reinforcing a victim mentality that I've been cultivating so carefully over the years, and also afraid that I've become such a sociopath and destroyed my life to such an extent that I don't deserve help. 

At 33, I am basically a textbook sociopath, I have almost no real emotional ties to any human beings, and my ethical compass has long ago been shattered by my greed and monstrous sense of entitlement. I have a degree from a psuedo Ivy league school, but with a pretty useless communications degree, and after paying loans on and off for 10 years, I am still 30k in debt and live in a tiny room in a loft in Brooklyn. I've been living for the past two years on a combination of unemployment benefits and a settlement I received from a lawsuit. My unemployment ended a few weeks ago, and I have at most, savings to last me a month or two max. I also have an extremely spotty resume due to another period of my life where I was unemployed for 3 years and living in a squat. Actually, all things considered, those were some of the best years of my life. I had a very small group of friends, was in a band,  and slept with my share of beautiful women. At one point we were even making money renting out spare rooms, and we were bribed to leave when a new owner bought the building. I got $18k...cash. Of course, in retrospect, I was totally kidding myself, and badly fucking up my prospects for the future. I did manage to get myself a rent stabilized apartment with some of this money though, which was a life saver, as I could survive in NYC on very little money once again. Mostly though, I think this fucked me up even more as once again, I should have hit rock bottom but was saved at the last minute by pure luck. I worked for a year or so after moving into my rent stabilized apartment, but like every single job I've ever had in my entire life, I was fired. I lived in unemployment for more than a year after that. Doing almost literally nothing with my life. 

Finally one day my lawyer suggested he could find me a therapist who would work for a potential cut of my eventual settlement, so I began seeing a therapist. Albeit, a somewhat inexperienced one with a thick Spanish accent. Still, I managed to get a decent job with a lowly title but great pay and benefits including free MOMA passes, life insurance 401k etc. etc. I even managed to make some friends at work and achieve some small professional success designing ads. I met a beautiful, rich, intelligent, girl. She ended up consuming my entire being, and was the direct cause of my growing success, as well as my inevitable decline back to nothingness. Long story short, she treated me like shit, I gave away my dog to live in a place closer to her, had a small nervous breakdown when I realized I couldn't bear giving up my dog, then she dumped me, I had a real nervous breakdown and was fired for fucking up at work. Ironically the day after she dumped me I got a call from my lawyer saying I won my trial and was about to get a check for $46k. Once again, money I didn't deserve saved me from reaching rock bottom. Though, truth be told I was at emotional rock bottom. At 30 years old I sat in my kitchen with the tip of a knife pressed into my medulla, wishing for the courage to press it in. In a fit of reckless numbness I slashed my right arm, leaving a permanent, and obviously self inflicted scar to match the much larger one from my first nervous breakdown at 22.

I put $4k into my student loans, went to Thailand for a few months and bought a motorcycle. Crashed the motorcycle in Manhattan, and with a permanently fucked up arm from a hit and run cabbie, I have another lawsuit in the works...once again, I am being rewarded for doing absolutely nothing.  

So here I am. 2 years later sitting in a tiny room with an obvious scar on my arm, wearing the same filthy pants I wear every day, so riddled with anxiety from ignoring my emotional and professional life that it is difficult to even walk out the door. The last pathetic shreds of my personality dissolve almost immediately whenever I leave my apartment, and my limited interactions with humans feels like an act. I've lost the ability to empathize with other people. My sister just got out of brain surgery and I am too scared of having nothing to say that I won't even call her. This is mostly why I feel like I deserve death. i am so selfishly wrapped up in my own pathetic misery that I can't spare a shred of emotion for my own sister. I just sit in my tiny room on reddit and pretend the world doesn't exist. 

But now, I am down to $2k in the bank, my unemployment is finished, and I have no job prospects and am too terrified of other humans to competently bullshit my way through a job interview. My social skills, even the thin veneer they once were have largely been obliterated by my refusal to participate in life. I know I need therapy, but I can't afford it. There is a gym next door to my apartment, but I am afraid of spending money on the gym and then running out of money entirely in a month because I can't get a job. I've had thoughts of buying a van to do moving jobs, but I haven't driven a car for 8 years...still I might get one and hire a driver. I did this a few years ago and made $60 an hour. Still, I can't do this for the rest of my life, and I have no career, and honestly have no idea how to figure out what I want to do. There are lots of things I would like to do, but because of my depression, even the things I like doing feel like shit most of the time. I've been doing a pro bono freelance gig as a copywriter (believe it or not, I can write pretty fucking well when I take my time...my one saving grace, I read constantly.) but this is not really a realistic, practical career path. I should have a house and a family at this point instead of a shitty little room and $30k in debt. Still, I keep fucking up and let my terror of life keep me down. I slept through my final interview for Teach For America, I can't be bothered/am too scared to take my life seriously. 

TLDR: I'm 33, my life is in the toilet, no career, no woman, massive debt, no friends, suicidal, terrified of life. I'm down to $2k and no job. I want to change...but my fear outweighs my motivation.

1271188532.0,12,self.needadvice,bqfyg,"Reddit, how do I tell my sister that I think that aborting her baby would be the right decision?",15,3,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/bqfyg/reddit_how_do_i_tell_my_sister_that_i_think_that/,"Very sensitive issue here.  Before I get started, let me say that I am pro-choice.  This means I support a woman's ability to choose to have an abortion but I also realize that decision is hers alone and it's her body and if she wants to have a child that is certainly her decision as well.

My sister is 16.  She lives in another state in the south with my mother.  Basically, everyone in my family except for me is something of a loser.  My mom never went to college and is currently unemployed, living off the money she got from selling her parents' assets after they died and that money's running out and it doesn't look like she's willing to get off her butt and get a job.  My older brother has been in and out of college and now he's got a child with a woman he's not married to (they've subsequently broken up) and I think he's currently going to ITT Tech or something like that.  My younger brother did go to college but now he works in retail and pretty much just smokes pot all the time.

I, somehow, escaped this mold.  I got into a very good college, got a degree, and currently work as a professional in a big city several hours away from where I grew up, probably making two or three times as much as my siblings and maybe even my parents.

Anyway, me and my sister have always had a special bond.  We've had many discussions in the past about how she needs to break out of the mold that most of my family has been stuck in.  We've talked a lot about what losers the rest of my family is and how I will do anything to keep her from following their lead.

Things had been going well.  Since no one else in my family has taken any initiative to see that she goes to college, I've taken it upon myself to set up some tours of some very good schools in the area and I've been saving up so I can help her pay for school (today I've got around 12k saved and I had been planning on taking out a 2nd mortgage on my house if that's what it takes to get her into a good school).  We've also been planning visits to some really great schools (Vanderbilt is one example).  I've also bought her numerous books about colleges to help her pick the one that's right for her as well as several ACT &amp; SAT study guides.  She's been super-excited about college and we've talked a lot about which one she wants to go to.

However, I hadn't heard from my sister for a few months (which is odd because we used to talk on the phone at least once a week) and one night when I called my mom said my sister didn't want to talk to me.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, my mom tells me that my sister is pregnant.  She's 16 and the guy is 19.  He works part time at a big-box retailer and he's going to school at a community college.  My sister has told my mom that she wants to have the baby and not put it up for adoption.  She's a junior in high school and she thinks that after she has the baby her and her boyfriend will get married, move in together and live happily ever after.  The way I see it, it will be next to impossible for her to finish up her senior year (who will be able to keep the baby while she's at school?  How can she go to school if she can't get much sleep b/c of the baby, etc?).  She also still thinks she will be able to pull off going to a reputable school like Vanderbilt with a 1 year old child.

I know, I know.  It is possible.  Every now and then you hear about someone who beats the odds and comes out ok in the end, but as much as I love my sister, I don't see this happening.  She isn't responsible at all.  She's never had a job and never really had to deal with the real world consequences of her actions.  I think that she thinks she'll have this child and if raising it is too hard my mom will just raise it for her (which, imo, will be a disaster in itself).  Years ago, my sister got a puppy, swearing up and down that she would take care of it and pay for vet bills, etc, and this dog is now basically my mom's dog.  She wanted a kitten so my mom got her one only after my sister promised to take care of it (emptying the litter box, etc) and she didn't hold up her end of the bargain so my mom eventually gave the kitten away.  Now she has another dog that my mom basically takes care of for her.  So she's never really had to be very responsible.

I haven't talked to my sister about this.  My plan is to go visit her in a couple of days and to take her out somewhere where we can talk without my mom around and tell her what a terrible mistake I think she will be making if she has this child.  I just don't know what I""m going to say.  I do know that I'm going to point out that if she has this child, she will probably end up just like my mom and brothers - stuck in some po-dunk town in the south living the life of southern white trash.  I'll tell her how much I had hoped she would be able to escape my family's legacy and actually make something of her life.  But what else can I tell her that will get this point across?

Let me add that I do realize that it is her life and she can do whatever she wants.  I'm not by any means trying to take this decision away from her or anything like that.  I just feel like she's living in a fantasy world right now where her bf has convinced her that they will live happily ever after if she has this child and he'll be able to support her and put her through college with his part-time job while also going to school and supporting a child.  My main goal for this talk I'm going to have with her will be at the very least to take her by her feet, pull her out of this fantasy land she's living in, and to plant her feel firmly on the ground so she'll fully grasp the reality of what she's getting herself into.  Any advice anyone can offer will be great.

The best case scenario as I see it is this: she decides to abort and I take a few days off work to help take care of her when she goes through the process.  I dated a woman once who got pregnant and decided to abort so I've kinda been through this process before and I at least have some idea of what to expect.

What am I supposed to do here?,13,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1kdai7/i_think_i_may_have_a_stalker_what_am_i_supposed/,"Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to help me with this. I'm really freaking out and I can't tell if I'm just being paranoid or what.

I work in a store with a bunch of guys who I'm friendly with. After work, we sometimes go next door to a small bar to have a few drinks and hang out. One night last week, an older guy was there while I was with two of my coworkers. He came up and made some comment like ""You're too pretty to have such a dirty mouth"" or some other bullshit. This guy has gotta be at least twice my age, probably old enough to be my dad (I am 22). 

Throughout the night he kept coming up to me, asking if he could buy me a drink/hang out, and I avoided talking to him because he was creeping me out, but telling off a guy that much bigger than me could actually put me in danger. Eventually, drunk me and my coworkers decided a good way to get him to leave me alone would be to give him my number. I created a google voice number and wrote it on a coaster. It may have worked, because he left immediately after that. I planned to just delete the number, but forgot about it and over the course of the past week he has called me multiple times a day, texted me calling me pet names, and leaving me increasingly aggressive and borderline threatening messages.

I KNOW it was stupid to give him that number. I don't need retroactive advice on how dumb of an idea that was. I was planning on just blocking the number and going about my life, but he has been hanging out at the bar next door every. single. night. When I walk by and see him there, I just turn right back around. He texts me every night to tell me he is at the bar. Then last night, when I wasn't working, he showed up at my job after we had closed asking for ""the girl who works here."" My coworkers told him I wasn't there and texted me telling me about it. So now, I don't want to block the number in case telling him off over text is the best option.

So far, I have ignored every attempt to communicate. Instead of taking the hint, he has escalated in his attempts to contact me. Coming to my job was so over the line, and I don't want to get in trouble for it. I just don't know what to do. I'm totally at a loss and kind of scared. I would tell him to stop contacting me but he knows where I work and I don't know if doing that would make him angrier. 

**TL;DR: I stupidly gave my number to a guy who was hitting on me in an attempt to make him go away. He has gotten increasingly persistent about seeing me, to the point of hanging out at my bar every night and coming to my job asking for me. I am scared and have no idea where to go from here.**",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_1kdai7,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1kdai7/i_think_i_may_have_a_stalker_what_am_i_supposed/,

This may be written pretty badly but please bear with me, a lot of effort and courage was put into this. 
I’m 19 y/o and my name’s mat.  During the past 2 years or so I’ve been having problems with my ‘cognition’ and I really need some help.  I will start by explain what I have been experiencing.
-Memory issues:  Having a terrible short/medium term memory.  Trouble remembering pretty much anything like events, names ( ex: watching tv shows for 6 seasons and only remembering the protagonists name), words (which I will touch on below), etc

-Trouble speaking:  Basically not having a clear presentation (mumbling at times, not speaking loud enough, and stuttering a bit).  Also forgetting words, I can’t go 1 minute without searching for a word and my memory blanking out on me. This makes it incredibly hard to speak because I feel very stupid and my flow is terrible.

-Emotional issues: A lot of ups and downs with my emotions.  Days where I feel very depressed not wanting to do anything with my life and pondering on my existence.  Other days I’m fine but I can’t call it happy, just ok if that makes any sense. 
  
I also have a lot of anxiety and confidence issues, I worry about a bunch of stuff that I know I shouldn’t be worrying about.  I also have a lot of social anxiety, speaking to anyone gives me some level of anxiety. I think this first appeared when I had terrible acne (it’s better now) I couldn’t speak to people, especially girls.  I wouldn’t want to be approached to closely because of my face.  
A general sense of mind fog.  I don’t really know how to explain it but I don’t feel sharp mentally.  Concentrating, thinking etc. requires a lot of energy.

I have made some lifestyle changes in the past 2 weeks to try and help myself. 
-I’ve been smoking cannabis daily for 2 years now; I have recently stopped though as I think it was detrimental to my cognition. This week has been a bit better; the fog is a tad less noticeable which I am happy about.  

-I have started to read out loud 1 hour a day, at first it was pretty hard as I would have trouble saying words but it’s getting better.  

-I have cut out competitive gaming as it would put me in a negative headspace and stress me out.

-I started meditation 15 minutes every day, will increase to 30minutes this week.  I’ve heard that this was good for the mind so I will give it a shot.  It seems to relax me too.

-I eat way better now, no more junk food, fruits and vegetables, with some vitamins every day. I also started working out.


I feel a bit better about myself now but I am still having all the problems I stated before, its crushing me I feel terrible and inferior to everyone right now..


Now I would really appreciate some insight on this; why is this happening to me.  Anything I can do that will help me?  Could be anything, exercises, books, nootropics, brain games, speech exercises, etc
Thank you very much for you time, really appreciate it.

How can I possibly thank her?",13,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1k4rzw/my_best_friend_completely_turned_my_life_around/,"For 15 years, I woke up every single morning wanting to kill myself.  15 years ago, I was about 8.  My parents refused to offer any help, and I was about 18 by the time I tried medication and therapy - it never helped.

The last 8 months of my life have been the first time I have ever felt hope.  I actually feel good most of the time - I still have many issues, but I'm not depressed, I don't think.  Every single morning, the first thing I notice is that everything feels okay.  I'm so overwhelmed by gratitude over the fact that I actually have an opportunity to live a normal, happy life that even just thinking about it makes me break down in tears, and I'm a guy.  

A friend of mine is completely responsible for the happiness I have now.  I would have killed myself without her support.  The thing is, I can hardly even explain what she did.  All she really did was be a great friend, but apparently that was enough.  I know that doesn't make sense.  I had a very lonely life, and she was the first person who actually cared about me - my parents never did.  She supported me unconditionally despite my depression and serious flaws.  She let me realize that it's okay to not be perfect.  I had no idea what it felt like to care about another person, and no idea what it felt like to be cared about.  Apparently it means everything.

Obviously I'm cutting the story short, but that's the gist of it.  I owe every experience I will have for the rest of my life to her.  She knows about my past, but I've never told her how direct of a role she had in my overcoming depression.

So, Reddit, how can I possibly thank her?  She probably feels like she didn't do all that much - she was mainly just a supportive friend.  I don't think anything I can say would possibly do justice to the difference she has made in my life.  What can I tell her?  What can I do?

My roommates have two dogs. One just over a year, one about six months. They both love to chew on things. Things they have broken in our house include:

* Prescription Glasses
* The back of my cell phone
* Many pairs of socks
* Various cables/wires
* Bowls
* Shoes

Most of which does not belong to the roommates who own the dogs.

I have two cats. They both like to eat my roommates dogs' food. I have tried to get them to teach their dogs to not be free fed, but they refuse. Food bowls often get left out when the dogs cannot get to it. It being inside when they are outside, it being upstairs when they are downstairs and a dog gate is up, etc.

I recently bought a [PetSafe SlimCat](http://www.amazon.com/pet-supplies/dp/B0018CG40O) for my bigger cat. I feed the cats right before I go to work, so that gets left on the floor in my room. I don't close my door because I don't want to trap the cat in my room. When I came home from work today, the SlimCat was destroyed by the dogs. This happened while they were upstairs with my sleeping roommate.

The roommates who own the dogs have the following grievances:

* They can't feed their dogs because if the food is out the cats will eat it. 
* Their dogs have to be locked in their room all day because they work opposite schedules (one at night, one during the day), so the dogs never have time to be out in the house.

My response with these two grievances are:

* They CAN feed their dogs out of the room. Feeding just needs to be supervised, and food needs to not be forgotten about and put away.
* It is true there isn't much time when one person is awake at home, but I feel this is an issue of training. They are not the most obedient dogs, and the owners get VERY defensive about anyone stating this fact, although it is very true. When the dogs are out when nobody is watching them, they get destructive.

Their solutions to the problems are

* Lock the cats up in one room so they can't eat the dog food/train the cats to not eat the dog food.
* Make *me* buy an $80 gate I can put across a hallway so the dogs cannot get in to my room and destroy my things.

She moved into a place, I decided I wanted to move and found a place that I will be moving into next month. I visited her place after I signed my lease and it happens to be right next door to the place that I will be moving into (Our windows actually face each other, except hers is one floor lower than mine)

Friend does not have internet because it costs too much and she doesn't get paid enough at her job to warrant getting it and has a data plan for her phone anyways. I sometimes have to work from home and require the internet, and I have the money to pay for it, so I will be getting internet. It's $80 a month, which is pretty pricy for what I'll be getting (high speed internet, not fibre op or anything. My ISP actually charges the same for basic fibre as it does for high speed, but I can't get the fibre op in my building.)

So the problem here is she's asked if she can use my internet. I feel bad where she doesn't have as well a paying job as me (She works 30-40/hr a week at a clothing store as a supervisor, I have a salary job and probably make 1.75 times what she makes) but our friendship isn't really that great as of late and she's admitted to being a bad friend and not being there for me at all through some serious stuff. I've actually distanced myself from her a lot and have mixed feeling about living next door to her.

So I honestly don't want her using my internet, for free, when I am paying $80 a month and her using it will bog down my connection. If she wants to pay, that's fine, because I'd rather not pay it all on my own, but I'm looking for advice on how to tell her that I don't want her using it for free (I currently live with two roommates and anyone who comes into the house is welcome to use the internet, but we have fibre op and it's split between 3 people. So she's used to being able to use my internet for free. She also frequently uses my phone chargers and used to sleep on my couch all the time and offered nothing as a thank you, such as cleaning up after herself.) and wondering what would be a decent amount to charge her.

I'm at home with my mum (and mum and dad have been separated since 2000) I'll just focus mostly on the last few months, because it really *is* a long story...

I've been struggling with **psychological problems** for a few years (and only last few months have I actually gotten help) these range from depression, anxiety, panic attacks... I admit sometimes I worry about going... well, crazy. It's in the family tree. These issues were around all through high school easily starting around 15 (or earlier). At the moment I'm on medication and in therapy and have done online courses given by my doctor - but that got pretty derailed when my dad died a month ago (June 16th) just after I turned 18 (June 12th).

***

**Dad's death** was unexpected - at least to us - he was 44 years old. He'd been getting better recently, and even when he got to his worst (nothing like when he died) he always came back in one piece. Dad was an alcoholic, schizophrenic, with a large range of other health problems. He died at home, in the middle of the night from a heart attack, in his sleep. My brother found him in the morning when he slept over. There was a police investigation since they didn't know the problem until the autopsy - where they also discovered another of his problems had been created by an undetected stroke - but it didn't go too far since there was no foul play. Then it became a disaster...

Me, James and Mum started to clean up his house a bit for a couple days (spent hours cleaning) - he lived in government housing, so it would need to be vacated. We wanted it to be a bit more ... honourable ... for when Nana came down. While cleaning I collected some of the things I wanted to remember him by: including art supplies and his artwork (we both loved art) and a couple of things from my childhood (like awards and soccer trophies). James got his tools (mostly old, but just for remembering) and got everything else he wanted. However, I didn't take everything I wanted since I was trying to be respectful to Nana and was going to make sure I didn't take something she really wanted.

We went to a funeral for my Great Uncle who had died the day after dad and we were away for one night. Nana and Mark had decided to come down while we were away (and we had told them we'd be at the funeral) without calling us and ""clean out the house"". They took everything of worth... and *put everything else in the trash*. Literally, we found a letter at the door asking for James to ring about dad's old laptop, we called, dad's ""friend"" said they'd cleaned up, went over and found a skip bin filled with everything ""worthless"". I found all the books from his book shelf, photos of me, James and dad, more of his art, some things from my room I'd missed, an old wooden clock that I had desperately wanted, baby pictures of dad... basically my entire childhood and memories of my dad. Shoved in a giant bin amongst broken class and rusty saws. ""Worthless"".

Dad's friend came back to collect the furniture that evening. But, we had taken the bookshelf, table and corner cupboard, dad had built before he came back with his trailer - he'd lied and told us it was already gone. He had planned to sell it to a friend. I am lucky to have saved anything. I spent two days in the skip bin, searching for all the little things, and was lucky to find some things not broken under it all. I hurt so much.

We had his funeral, and now waiting for the ashes. I'm still numb and feel guilty for not spending nearly enough time with him.

***

I love **university**. I'm studying psychology and look forward to it most days. I did decide to only do 3 units/subjects this semester (not 4), which has made it much more manageable. It's still hard, especially with everything that's happened. I don't sleep well, and my concentration is off. I'm still doing okay, but my anxiety makes it difficult.

I don't spend as much time doing it as I should - the homework aspect. I'm usually really tired, exhausted, and a bit brain dead. I've also got a seemingly endless supply of chores and ""responsibilities"" thrust upon me by my mum. Which is where my problem is.

***

**THE PROBLEM**

My mum - she is full on, controlling, stressful, angry, grumpy, scary, ""tired"" ... and my mother. I'm the oldest of 3 kids (James (15) and Ariel (7) - Ariel is my half-sister) and basically take on the role of second parent. I can't remember a time where I didn't look after them. I looked after James when I was with dad at 7+ and have been looking after Ariel since 11. 

I baby sit, cook dinner, get Ariel and James ready for school most (if not all) days, look after, feed and train the ""family"" puppy AND *clean everything, all the time* - I cannot stress this enough, my mum is insane about me cleaning the entire house. I don't know if it's possible to imagine how stressed I get from this (it may even sound stupid) but I clean *everything*. Kitchen, bathroom, lounge room, Ariel's room, my room (fair enough), the cupboard, the floors, the windows, the trash, the dog poop, the dog, after dinner, before dinner, after breakfast and lunch, whenever Ariel goes into the lounge room and leave another mess, when the dog pees on the floor, dishwasher, mum's paperwork/tax, everyone's washing - wash, put out, bring in, fold and put away. There is probably a dozen more. I do each of these almost everyday, sometimes more than once.

I am happy to contribute to the house by cleaning - but then I get verbally abused because I STILL never clean enough. She always says I am useless and lazy and do *nothing*. She uses at least a dozen swear words per sentence when she's mad - her favourite line ""Why couldn't you just fucking [what ever the problem is]""... I *always* seem screw up in her mind.

Most teenagers seem go out to parties, drink, stay out all night and sleep in late, maybe do drugs or smoke, have unprotected sex, neglect their studies, watch tv or movies a lot, or go online. Me? I go online. I'm 18 (legal drinking age, in a drinking culture) and I don't touch it. I specifically bought myself some bottles of non-alcoholic wine for my 18th birthday party (combined with close friends 18th) so I didn't have to drink or be judged. I don't touch smoking or drugs, I'm usually home before dark unless the bus is late from university, I am usually awake early 6-7am every single day (Sunday's included). I'm not out having a ton of random sex (not that it really matters, just on a parental level), or going to pubs, bars, clubs. I stay at home either studying, online, cleaning, cooking, babysitting, puppy training, or dare I think it... relaxing.

SO WHY AM I NEVER GOOD ENOUGH!?!?

I hate how she always talks about how hard she works - but how can she think I ""do nothing""? How else do the kids get to school on time, ever!? I wake them up, help with breakfast, teeth brushing, hair brushing (the 3 foot mane Ariel has grown), lunch packing, getting her dressed, checking she has the right things for the right days ... and having them on a school bus at 8.30 am. THEN I get ready to go to university, ~~walk~~ run into town to catch the local bus, catch bus to Uni on the edge of town and run to which ever class I'm supposed to be at. I'm already exhausted by the start of the day, since I don't sleep without nightmares or waking up all night, and then I have to get up early to get other people ready for the day.

Usually by the time I get home mum is mad about something I forgot to do that morning - like some washing she never told me about or dirty dishes Ariel left on the sink. She always ~~complains~~ yells that I should ""just know"" what should be done.

Well you know what... I DO NOT FUCKING KNOW WHAT YOU WANT! She never explains anything, it's just a basic ""you failed, now you're worthless... again"". No simple ""You missed this, but don't worry you did other stuff"", no list of expectations, no conversations about it because she ""doesn't want to have to tell us what to do""... There is nothing to work from - and she is never around, and we never know what to expect.

It endless. I also think she doesn't really believe I'm depressed, or understand what that means for me. I get suicidal still, and self harm (not usually cutting). My anxiety can lead to panic attacks, where I'm so afraid to even get out of bed... I just end up crying from fear and frustration. I don't sleep well, so I'm always exhausted. I struggle to look after myself and never go out on social events. I get so stressed my back, shoulders and joints hurt, I feel sick and get headaches, I cry, I have terrifying nightmares,  I can't concentrate. I'm falling apart.

So yes, sometimes I forget to do the little things - I can't help it. And sometimes I'd rather be dead.

**TL;DR: My mum controls me, no matter how hard I try I can never be enough, I'm depressed and suicidal from the stress, my dad died and I just can't keep up with what she expects from me.**

For the last couple of years my life has been getting worse and worse. Overtime I've been doing less and less with my life. Right now I'm 15, I live with my parents(obviously) and I'm going into 10th grade with only 4 credits. First semester I barely got all 4 credits, second I got 0. I could not bring myself to attend classes and just skipped almost all of them.

In grade 8,  I was considered a pretty popular kid(I was kind of in the ""cooler"" group of kids). Grade 9(Last year) I had my group of friends and we hung out for the beginning of the year, but as it dragged on I was getting less and less social. Now I'm at the point where I haven't gone out with friends in the past 4 months, and I barely ever leave my house. I have appointments with my emotional therapist every week, and that's pretty much the only place I go.

I have a little brother who's 12 right now, and I never do anything with him. Me and my parents argue everyday. They used to try to get me to do chores around the house, but now they're just rude to me and don't care. All day they make sarcastic remarks around me, and just insult me. Like I said, they used to try to make me do chores around the house but now all they do is try to get me asleep.

On the topic of sleep, I barely get any of that. I lie in bed for at least 4 hours every night unable to sleep, until I end up just getting up and going back on my computer and then staying up until next morning.

My body is weak, and I've been eating okay-ish. I have extremely low self-esteem. My group of friends that I was hanging out with would pick on me a lot, and often make fun of me in front of people I didn't know which really got to me.

When I'm on the computer all day I'm normally either just talking with people, or playing games(LoL, Minecraft etc.) A lot the time I'm actually doing nothing, and just browsing the web. I always somehow end up consuming my whole day on it. I don't know what to do about it...

Please Reddit, I really need help. Not sure what to do with myself anymore and I fear that if I don't do something soon I'm going to drop out. I want to get my diploma, and I want a good life. I just need help. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I studied advertising and public relations in college, I think I'm an excellent people-person and I love cars. I feel like this job fits me very well, and I was very excited about the job when I started two months ago; March 25th to be exact. 

However, I've only made three sales since then and I can't help but feel like I'm making stupid mistakes on vital steps in the sales process. As many times as I've studied our sales procedure and training literature, I always come to a point where I freeze up because I blank out on what to do next. If it isn't that, I'll let people walk too soon which causes me to lose a potential lead and also upsets my boss. 

It seems like I've gotten ""almost but not quite"" with many guests I've talked to, and I feel like I get stuck with a lot of customers with unrealistic expectations or people who aren't financially prepared to buy a car yet. My co-workers have been more than happy to help me, and I've utilized their assistance when I can, but I want to be able to complete a sale on my own.

I am very confident in my ability to build rapport with people, show them a car they may like, and answer any questions they have about the car. I have trouble when it comes to numbers, special rates, and credit situations because this is my first time in any sort of sales atmosphere. I'm also very good about following up with people, but I've had a number of folks who never answer their phonecalls or e-mails which makes my job more difficult and it makes me look like I'm not doing anything.

I guess I'm looking for better ways to overcome any objections people have, as well as get people buttoned down on a deal sooner. I don't want to be *that* salesman; you know the ""WHAT CAN I DO TO GET YOU DRIVING THIS CAR TODAY?!"" types, and I know I don't have to because that just doesn't work. 

I really want to do better here because I feel like it's my calling and I want to move up to high-end car sales. I got this job a week after the end of the semester and I see it as the perfect opportunity to start on that career path. I just need to figure out what I'm doing and how to do it effectively.

For a year and a half, I have been adjunct teaching art classes at my alma mader while working part time at a bookstore (which I absolutely love and am not prepared to leave). This had worked out great until low enrollment forced me to stop adjuncting at that school and take up full hours at the bookstore. I have missed out on a semester of teaching and applied for some other adjuncts around the area  with no luck, until I got offered a last minute class at a school I haven't taught at before in a subject I am not so confident in. I took the job because I was desperate for some teaching experience (especially at a new school which looks really good). **I have verbally confirmed this job but have not signed any papers yet** and have moved around my schedule at the bookstore to accommodate. Meanwhile, the pervious school needs me for TWO classes (both of which I have already taught and am extremely comfortable with) on days that I don't work at the bookstore. This would be more money, and easier on my schedule. But, IM feeling like I have an obligation to stick with the first school? Im in a position where money an experience are key, so I really don't want to screw this up with either burned bridges or not enough money to pay the bills. Technically I could teach all three classes as they do not pose a time conflict, but I am worried about how this would impact my bookstore job, which has been such a great cushion and opened up a lot of doors for me.

It was obvious I was someone who was looking to move up and move up quick.  So, when the opportunity came along to apply for ""supervisor of the BOTTPs"" I eagerly applied.  It was me and one of the other BOTTPs that applied.  She has been with the company for much longer than I have, and could probably do some of the points of the job better than I could.  However, during the application process she did not pass an assessment, therefore could not go further.  When it was announced that I had the position, of course some of the other BOTTPs were upset.  I could see how they would be considering the other applicant's relationship with the company etc.  I just don't want them to think (forever) that the wrong one got the job.

Posted on r/self too, but I figured this was a good place too. Ok, this is gonna be a bit long. I’m 20 years old and attending college in another state. My relationship with my parents is killing me right now. They’re not bad parents. In fact by most intents and purposes, they’re great parents. They’re paying for an expensive university, and they’ve taken care of my food, housing, etc. I’ve never had to really worry about anything either in terms of finances, housing, clothes, and so on. Because of these factors, I feel like shitty for what I’m about to say. My parents don’t let me go out. I’m 20 and they still have a pretty tight hold over me. Mind you, this is only when I come home though, and I’m only home for an extended period of time over the summer. Also, when I say go out, I mean get out of the house for a few hours four days in the week. I can be gone for a couple hours in the day time, and everything after that is not allowed. When I am home, I become so painfully aware of how little things have changed in my life. It’s not just going out either. They’re Indian, so they fucking strongly believe in the duty of son to family or some shit like that. When I’m at college, they expect me to tell them if I leave campus at all and I do anything like go to movies. Concerts and shit like that are discouraged and usually forbidden. I know all of this seems superficial and stupid , and it sounds like I am being petty but it ties into the larger problem. They expect me not to drink or smoke. They expect me to not date. They want an arranged marriage for me. There’s so much stuff in my life that I should get to decide that they have predecidied for me. In high school they kept a tight hold on me and I barely got out of the house. Girls were a no no. I got to college, and I realized how painfully inept I was socially because I’d been forced back for so long. I still have a hard time socializing, because of how they fucking raised me. There’s all this shit that stems from their need to have control in my life. I got back home from summer school, and the next day I wanted to go out with friends. They told me that if I loved my family I would have chosen to stay home the entire day. I was let out for two hours. I’m fucking 20. I know I sound like a selfish child, but it’s expected to continue like this by their own admission. Until I am married they are essentially my monitors. I remember they were talking about how my cousin was a shitty son once, because he took a trip to the Grand Canyon without telling his parents. My cousin is 26, and his parents live 700 miles away. I’m grateful, I really am for everything they’ve done for me, and for the fact that they genuinely care about me. All I want is to live my own life, and with how my parents are and how culturally ingrained it is in them to have control over their kid’s life, I feel like I’ll have to tell them to fuck off at some point. I just wanna marry someone I love and be my own person, but they won’t be able to get over the little things like my wife being not indian, me drinking, and smoking. Also, on a side note, their practice of raising me in a cave left me socially fucktarded. When I first got to college, I couldn’t talk to girls or hold a conversation for the life of me. I’ve been learning at college, and I’ve actually gotten a lot better at socializing and talking to people. I’m glad I got out of my rock, because the world never seemed bigger and scarier (in a good way). Also, the worst part about this is my parents aren’t inherently bad people. They were raised one way and it conflicts with who I am. Lose-lose for everybody. In the end, I don’t feel like I’m asking for a lot. If I had the option of not going to expensive but getting to live my own life, I’d gladly take it. I’ve dreamed about just walking away so many times, abandoning everyone I know and just starting over. I can’t though because I’m not adult now and I gotta be practical about it. Rent, health insurance, etc. all adds up. Am I a shit person for feeling like this and saying no to what they want even though they pay for everything? Are there other people out there who understand what this is like? Are there people who have been in similar situations whose lives have turned out alright?

I've apologized over and over but she just isn't buying it. Am I in the wrong here? What more can I do?**

Background: My close friend and I were talking on the phone yesterday. She's three years younger than me and about to enter college for the first time, and she's stressed about a lot of things (she's had to change her intended major a few times, pressure from other individuals, doubt, etc.). She really hates when older college students tell her about their experiences and whatnot unsolicited (unless they are close to her), because she just wants to experience it all with a fresh perspective and will ask about certain things if she really wants to know.

At the time, she was talking about how people are trying to get her to go in a certain direction when all she wants to do is just strive for her dream of being an anesthesiologist. I tried to relate to her situation through my own troubles of the same nature, but before I could even start she snapped at me for about two or three minutes about how if she wanted to know about my ""wack-ass school"", she would ask. 

Before I go on, I should also say that she says things like this to me all the time in a joking manner, however the tone and inflection behind her voice proved otherwise this time. I just kind of shut down and didn't really say anything. I was mad at the fact that she would seriously snap at me for just trying to help. A few minutes later, she said she was just joking, but the damage had already been done on my end - all of my responses to her questions were short and monotone, which for me is a sure sign that I'm angry. At that point, I had to go get ready for my mom's birthday dinner so I said I'd talk to her later.

And, I did. I called her after I got back to apologize for being a big baby earlier and she had no idea what I was talking about so I explained what happened which is when everything went wrong. She got mad at the fact that I got mad at her and she hung up on me. She then started texting me and I tried to explain everything as best as I could but she just wasn't hearing any of it. [If you all want, I can post the conversation here]

So after about 30 minutes of getting nowhere, I decided to just let us both have some time apart to blow off steam. She called me about three hours later and we started talking again, but the vibes were still strange. She told me not to apologize anymore and that it was fine, but I'm smart enough to know that it really isn't yet... and I feel like she's moving in a direction to drop me out of her life, because she's done drastic things like that before.

My question to you all is this: What the heck happened? Was I in the wrong at all? I'm honestly trying to figure out why she's still mad at me if *I'm* the one that got hurt and apologized when I didn't really need to. I'd like to believe that she wouldn't trash our friendship over this rough patch, but I just don't know for sure... Thanks in advance, /r/needadvice.

I put a stop to their trolling of my friends, despite them telling me not to, saying ""Why are you so mad about it?"". When I stepped in and pretty much ruined their trolling it shattered the illusion of what a lot of people thought of them, and in their opinions, made them quit the game because they couldn't mess with people anymore.

As retaliation, one of them tried to frame me by taking my name and doing all sorts of things to piss people off, fortunately, that did not work.

Fast forward several years to today, I received a skype friend request, that person having my sister's face as their profile picture. At first I thought it, actually was my sister. However moments later I received another with my face as the profile picture. And another with a family portrait, leaving a taunting message that they used to tell people back when I knew them.

As I realized who it was, It dawned on me that It wouldn't take long before they started harassing my family to get to me, and honestly. I have no idea what to do about this.

There are other details I find stressful that won't get into here for personal reasons, but it is all taking its toll... and starting to effect life outside of work too.    


Current thoughts...

*1)  I am about to start a very part-time position as a host family recruiter for international students studying in the US.  In a few months I will have a better feel for this job, but right now think it sounds like a great social job, with less stress than the 8-10 fast-paced one-hour appointments I currently have each day.   Even so, this is still very little pay, but what I figure to be good experience in a direction better suited for me.  
*2)  I have also considered getting my TESOL or CELTA certification, but am not sure of the need or pay within the US.  
*3)  A friend of mine has offered to help teach me Photoshop/design and help find me some small projects to create a little side income.  Hoping to start learning this week.  
*4)  When my student loans are payed, I have the thought that I would like to work with a non-profit organization, in particular one with a focus on community building and neighborhood outreach - just thoughts at the moment.   Maybe volunteer recruitment or program/event lead...?  I have volunteered with numerous organizations, but nothing that seems to be gaining me any experience/knowledge in how these organizations run.  Not sure what type of volunteer role I should be seeking.  



Am I narrowing my thinking too much?  The career paths I feel most passionate about do not generate enough income while I am trying to pay of my student loans - so I will have to reconsider in another 5 years.    I am even open to combining a couple different jobs to help make ends meet, but I have yet to find that combination that would allow me to continue earning about $50k/yr.

I [made a post](http://en.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1fdcn2/need_advice_on_finding_a_therapist/) a few days ago about how I should go about finding a therapist. I got some helpful responses and have narrowed down the list of potentials to six, using the resources and suggestions you guys had, and I'm at the point where I want to start calling people. (Thanks for the info on first phone calls too!)

I have 6 people I'm considering. Given that I don't know who out of the six I'll like the best, is it appropriate/how do I go about continuing the shopping around process? 

I think ideally I'd phone all six of them, leave a brief message, and wait for them to call back. Then, I would wait until I've spoken with a few of them before picking my favorite and making an appointment. Also acceptable to me (though maybe impossible with insurance) would be to make appointments with everyone who calls back, and pick my favorite to continue with. But based on what I've been reading, maybe neither of those things are appropriate? Maybe I make an appointment with the first person who calls back and move on only if I hate them?

I'm struggling with making a decision to move out of my parents house. I'm 18, and I'm about to graduate high school. my parents told me they wouldn't mind if I moved out this summer, and in fact would prefer it if I wasn't going to be well-behaved (read: I'm a queer, atheist ent who likes to stay out late. my parents are the picture of southern, straight-laced middle america). I actually did it, and they hit me with the hugest guilt trip/disappointment lecture I've ever had. they have managed to make me feel simultaneously unwanted at the house and a traitor for moving out. I need someone else's take on this. anyone.


why am I moving out? there are several reasons.

my parents house is toxic. we do nothing but fight and talk about what a disappointment I am. we barely ever connect (hell, we barely even see each other). tonight, my father threw my vibrator across my front yard and said he “told me he didn’t want this shit in his house.” when asked to clarify, he did confirm his meaning - he did not want me masturbating. true fucking story.


I want to live a life that attempting to live under my parents’ roof would be both inconvenient and disrespectful. I want to party, and come home late, and enjoy being young with a job and freedom. I have/had a plan for my life that I am definitely following. they just don’t like it, because the plan has been “fuck around until college. do as little as necessary to graduate” since I found out that I wasn’t going back to my early-college program. that’s not fair to make my parents watch. no parent wants to see their kid smoke pot and accomplish nothing. also, living with my parents is just inconvenient, with things like curfews and their tendency to dig through my stuff and then yell at me for it (see: vibator, above).


I don’t feel like I can be myself at my parents’ house. I feel like I’m constantly pretending. gotta be cautious about what I say or where I go, lest I break the seal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” that surrounds my sexuality/mental health/drug use/social life. my parents know I’m queer/having sex/depressedanorexicwhatever/usually stoned/out partying on a regular basis. but we don’t acknowledge it until we start fighting, which is a stressful way to live for both of us.


my family and I get along wayyyy better when we don’t live together. when my parents and I aren’t fighting or forced to live with each others’ shenanigans, things are generally okay. also, it’s better for my brothers, who experience massive anxiety at the hands of mine and my parents’ disagreements.


I feel like I have to get out of my parents’ house to actually accomplish any real strides in my growing up/recovering/making myself a reasonably productive member of society. being here makes me want to play angsty-fifteen-year-old and rebel. except in decidedly grown-up ways. 

I want to. I’m going to be honest, I just want a few months where I am on my own. 


why I shouldn’t move out:

it would upset my family. everyone is unhappy about this, even my extended family/grandparents/etc. I don’t like to upset my family.


it would be expensive. I can afford it, but it doesn’t leave a lot of wiggle room to save up for college and things. although, I'm on a full-ride scholarship and am a CPhT with an IV certification, meaning I have job options.


it’s a lot of responsibility. this is self-explanatory. adulthood is scary.


it could backfire horribly, and instead of getting on my feet, I could fall miserably and end up incarcerated/hospitalized/dead.


**TL;DR living with my family is hard, but I wonder if moving out would be harder.**


I don't know what to do, but I don't have anyone to ask for advice. my family/most ~*~real adults~*~ in my life have such a different value system and view of the world that their advice would be useless. for example, I tried explaining my confusion to my mother, and she told me to pray. so, thoughts? **am I doing the right thing by moving out? am I being a rash, petulant child?**


******UPDATE: I had a talk with my parents. I explained these things to them. Well, some of them. I think they actually understood. They're still not thrilled, but they're not guilt-tripping me anymore. Signed my lease, I move in on the fifteenth. :D********

They bought a dog about 6 months ago without the landlord's permission (there's a weight restriction in our building) and the dog has to weigh at least 40lbs at this point. The issue as a whole is that they are extremely loud during weekdays and sometimes on the weekend. It has gotten worse in the past month.

Their dog barks randomly at all hours of the day and jumps up and down/runs around a lot (which is obviously why the weight restriction was made since this is a small, old building). They also argue almost every evening from 10pm until they go to bed at 1am and seem to decide to clean or who knows what to the point where there are repeated banging noises before 8am. This morning I was woken up by a loud noise at 7am and it has continued for two hours now.

They are also incredibly rude to us. The one time we have had people over, we were ""loud"" (there were 5 or 6 of us) until about 10:30 on a Saturday night and then one of the people who lives up there came and banged on our door and told us they had work tomorrow, blah blah, and that we needed to keep it down. I told them we were leaving in 15 minutes for a bar but we would try to be quieter. I found out the next morning that after talking to me, the woman had called our landlord to complain. That is the only time we've ever had people over like that and we've tolerated them having parties on weekdays.

I've tried talking to them when there's a problem and they say it won't happen again but obviously that's BS. Sometimes they won't even answer their door but, because they are stupid, you can hear them talking about how they know it's another person complaining about their dog. I've called our landlord repeatedly about noise and about the dog, he either doesn't answer his phone or says he'll do something about it and does not. I've called the cops but I live in a city so they usually won't come for a noise disturbance.

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I'm cranky now because I went to bed at 1am and got woken up at 7am. This has become a repeat problem. We've had other neighbors tell us they've tried to talk to these people with no luck, too.

**Reasons why I dislike where I live (deep south)**

- I really feel out of my element here
- The weather blows - cold winter, humid/rainy summers
- I don't genuinely care about conventional sports. Some are fun to watch, but I'd rather hit up some trails or a skatepark.
- Dislike country music
- Don't hunt/fish, nor have a desire to
- I also live in a small college town, so there is usually just a few bars with mainly country music playing
- Women here overwhelmingly prefer straight-laced, religious southern men.


**Reasons I think cali would be awesome**

- I've been offered a job doing what I enjoy. It pays well... so I would be financially better-off
- People there seem more accepting of non-religious people
- Much better weather
- I really enjoy playing music of all kinds (except country), and want to start/join a band again. The california music scene is pretty cool.
- a lot more people there are into surfing, snowboarding, skating, or trail-riding.
- The field I'll be working in is flourishing out there, and pretty much non-existant here.
- del taco

Really my only apprehension is losing the few awesome friends I currently have here... I know I'll make new friends and all, I just hate leaving all that behind. I could definitely use a second opinion.

So long story short, last year I dropped out of a private college.

Yesterday I get a call from the debt collector telling me I owe the small liberal arts college 1,700 dollars, as a portion of the financial aid I had been given was apparently conditional on my not dropping out. I stupidly gave him my debit card number, and confirmed my e-mail/mailing address/SS. I also asked for proof of debt in writing, and he said he can't directly send it to me, he has to ask my previous college (the one I dropped out of).

Does any of this sound reasonable? I'm worried I'll on the hook for 143 a month payments before I get my proof of debt. I'm also worried I wont be able to make the payment, and will have to deal with overdraft fees as I was recently let go of my current minimum wage job.

Is there anyway I can keep her?,14,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1alh15/roommate_is_moving_out_she_neglects_her_cat_is/,"There is a WHOLE lot of back story, but I'll just give the significant details. Basically, 3 roommates live together, we each have a cat. One roommate is not working out with us. We were going to ask her to move out, but she offered to move out. The kicker? She neglects her cat and we really care for it.


In the past six months or so, our roommate got a new boyfriend. Now she is NEVER home. In that period of time, my roommate and I have fed her, cleaned up after her, played with her, and taken to her general day-to-day duties. Even our little kitties are best friends with her cat! Our roommate bought a 6 lb. bag once in that span of time and no litter. Well, this kitten is maturing and now is always going into heat. She refuses to pay the vet bills for it. She is sort of a ""I want a cuddly companion, but I don't want to pay for it"" sort of girl. She is 20. Once when she was in heat, she told us to just throw her cat in her room for a few days until she's ""over it"". 

Now, she is a very prideful person. It's embarrassing enough that she was so dramatic we can't live her, but for her, keeping her cat is more of a point of pride more than because she loves this cat. In this time, my roommate and I, include our two kitties, have grown very fond of the cat and want to take care of it. We can provide a good home, get its shots, and get it fixed. She has given away a dog before but I am not unsure of the circumstances of it - she has a problem with taking care of her animals.


So, how can I convince my roommate to leave her cat when she moves, but also not insult her and her pride?

I spent a week at my current place of employment when I was 14 and after spending 2 of those days working in a kitchen, I was offered the opportunity to return on a part-time basis when I was old enough (16). Before my 16th birthday, I wrote to them about the possibility of a part-time job and they called me saying that I could. I started in January and have so far worked just 8 shifts.

The problem is, I *hate* it. I'm not just talking about disliking my job as most people do, I'm talking about *really* not wanting to be there. I'd be willing to work for far less if it meant getting to work elsewhere.

I thought when I wrote to them that I'd enjoy it a little but it's the opposite. Instead, it's 8 hours of lackey-work for low pay. I feel that the worst part is that there's nothing to occupy my mind. I'll stand for hours at a time cleaning veg with nobody to speak to and we're not even allowed to play music or have a radio on. I'm not a person who cries at things (in fact, I don't remember the last time I cried), but last week I felt like I wanted to.

The problem isn't whether or not I should leave though. I *know* that I want to leave, and I want to do something else that'll at least mean I get to see and interact with people and occupy my mind. The problem is how I can actually get out of this. This is my first place of employment, so they're the only thing I can put in the 'past employment' section of an application. What are they going to say to any potential future employers if I left them after just 2 or 3 months? I can't stick at this job, it's depressing and I feel so crap before, during and after it.

How am I supposed to go about leaving this job? I doubt it'll go down well with my superiors if I tell them that I want to leave and those are the people who I need to get references from.

I hope this post doesn't sound silly, I just have no experience with this kind of thing and I feel trapped in my current job because any potential employers *will* speak to them only to be told that I left after a couple of months because I hated it.

If you can help me out at all, I'd really like to hear your advice. Thanks for reading all of this.

We live in a one-bedroom apartment- she gets the bedroom, I get the couch. I'm actually coping with this rather well, given that I don't have a batcave of my own. She works full-time, so she's gone often enough that I don't run into the ""HEY ROOMMATE YOU'RE HERE WE SHOULD HANG OUT"" nonsense that I had last time I didn't have my own room. We talk, but it hasn't gotten to the point where I've been annoyed with her.

However, she's been running into issues with me being here. Not of the ""You're annoying, go away"" sort, but of the ""I need to not be around people"" sort. She also has trouble saying no to social invitations, and that's a major factor here. She has a hard time saying ""I need to hang out at home and have it be quiet"" when people ask to hang out- she's afraid that if she says no to social invitations, she'll no longer be invited to begin with.

She's also been having a lot of instability in her life recently- within the past nine months or so, she's graduated college, moved three times, started and quit grad school, started a new job, let me move in with her, got engaged, started planning her wedding, and postponed her wedding.
So I see two things she needs help with, and I am at a loss for particulars because I'm not good at coming up with things to recommend that people do.

One, she needs to find some sort of stable thing that she can hang onto. She grew up in the same house her whole life, so the past few months have been really rough on her.

Two, she needs to be able to tell people that she needs her introvert time, and needs to be able to deal with me using her living room as a batcave.

Any advice y'all could give would be appreciated. I'm stuck, personally. I've also got my suspicions that perhaps her depression is coming back more than she cares to admit, but a fair amount of that is situational rather than chemical.

Edit after sleeping on this:

Basically, I get plenty of introvert time and she doesn't. This is because of how our schedules line up: she's working 40 hours a week, and I'm only in 16 hours of classes. When she's gone, I get my introvert time, but I'm hardly ever gone during her scarce free time, so she hasn't gotten any introvert time for herself.

I have so many mixed emotions right now: anger/disgust with her, and guilt for feeling so. What do I do?",13,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/17x3pv/my_mom_apparently_believes_some_pretty_horrible/,"I'm totally at a loss and am really confused as to what to do.

First some background: I'm a 19 year old guy, and at the present I'm living at home (I had lived away for awhile but moved back about 9 months ago.) My mom is divorced, and that entire ordeal has been a rather turbulent experience. We have had a rather rough relationship, but things had kind of been starting to even out. 

Now, for what happened. Honestly, none of this really should have come as a surprise. I think what happened was more that the issues came to a head such that I could no longer ignore them. My mom, and my maternal extended family is a very religious family (Catholic). I am not religious, though I am by no means antitheistic. Unfortunately, my respect for my mom's beliefs (her religious ones anyhow) is not reciprocated. Nevertheless, I try to avoid being confrontational because, though I do not agree, I do understand her perspective. That being said, there is a very odd synthesis of religion with some odd conspiratorial thinking. Conspiracy theories are a tough subject for me, because there is a very thin line between the sort that are crazy, but harmless, and those which are morally objectionable. The conversation started with her claiming that she heard that the ancient papal palace in Avignon, France had been converted to a Masonic Temple. As an aside, I'm not exactly why this would matter considering the fact that the Papacy returned to Rome ~500 years ago (I forget the exact date). I argued with her, and I'll admit, I was probably too abrasive. I got frustrated because she refused to listen to what I was saying, and so I essentially told her that what she was saying sounded like a bunch of nonsensical, paranoid conspiracy claptrap. It went down hill from there. I don't remember the order or the details, but those aren't really relevant. What I did learn is that she is a Holocaust denier, 9/11 truther, Obama birther, International Jewish Conspiracy/Illuminati/NWO believer, and a bunch of other craziness. That, and while I have tried to ignore it and handwave it away, there has always been an undercurrent of subtle racism I have noticed in her. I got angry, lashed out, called her a bigot, and said what she believed was morally reprehensible (I stand by those things, but I was wrong in how I said them). I did try to explain, but as is the case with conspiracy nuts, she was not interested in listening. 

Anyway, as I said, I am extremely confused right now and I don't know what to think. She seemed extremely surprised, and did not understand at all why any of this bothered me. It is odd, because she does not seem to think what she believes is fringe (she told me this) and that I am somehow the one with the fringe beliefs. She then proceeded to tell me that I am just naive, young, that I don't know anything, and just general sorts of assertions that I was wrong. It hurts, a lot, to hear someone close to you say such terrible things (and furthermore, to believe them). The thing is, there is a difference between differing politcal beliefs, and indencent beliefs. Obviously, it is fine if people disagree on things like, I dunno. . .politics, football teams, etc. But, when someone believes such bigoted trash it reflects upon the character. It is disturbing to see that side of her, because it is not something I had considered. I know I'm probably rambling, and maybe being a little over-dramatic, but I am truly at a loss for words. I feel so emotionally injured and hurt by the experience. And the worst part is that she doesn't understand, whatsoever.",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_17x3pv,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/17x3pv/my_mom_apparently_believes_some_pretty_horrible/,

I have been thinking about this for a very long time and I think it's something that needs to be discussed.

I'm a 17 year old junior currently in high school. I transferred to a high school outside my area with very different kinds of kids than in my area. I only had one other friend going there from my area in freshman year. It was pretty rough getting into the groove of things, but by the end of freshman year I fit in, sort of.

But this isn't about how my high school life is so far, it's about how I feel. How I feel towards others, how I feel about myself, and how I feel about the way others treat me.

I guess it starts back at 3rd grade when I transferred to public elementary school from a catholic school. I was the kid that liked Yugioh and pokemon and thought I had friends even though most kids thought I was weird. I really don't remember 3rd grade all that well, I guess the only thing I can really come up with is that people were too young to act 'cool' and inch away from pretending to not like little kid stuff or go against group norms.

4th, 5th, and 6th grade I had made more friends, but more of the friends that people thought were weird or 'uncool'. I was always concerned about what people thought about me, so I often got anxious whenever people would question why I hung out with these kids that I got along well with. That has how I've been, and I'm not sure if a little bit still remains in me today, for as long as I can remember ever since I started 3rd grade. Always conforming to the group's norms. 

Fast forward to 7th and 8th grade, I met two jerks that I considered my 'friends'. They were total ass holes, they put me down for word I said, they called me a queer, they basically leeched off me to gain their own confidence and self esteem. They really crippled my confidence, it took me months to get my courage back. I fucking hate them for what they did to me mentally. But enough about them, I am getting side tracked from the main point here.

Come 9th grade, I was a loner at a new school. My friend from my area that I said earlier that came to the school was almost instantly popular. I don't know what he did, maybe he just had a nicer looking demeanor about him. (I very recently found out that my neutral facial expression makes me look like I'm angry or pissed, which I hate) Now picture you're in my place. The only friend you have at a new school, new people, everyone else has their groups they hang out with, and you're alone in your friend's shadow. You'll be talking with him and people will say hi to him but not to you, you'll be talking and people will pull him off to the side or start talking to him while you're in mid-sentence. People won't even regard you talking to him or standing there with him. It's one of the worst feelings in the world. It took me a long time to make friends at the school. I was cutting the line pretty close to almost committing suicide. It was bad.

By the end of the year, I had made a lot of friends. It was a nice change of pace, however, I was still in the shadow of my other friend.

You see, I feel like I am always the one that has to start the conversation, or the one that has to get people's attentions. Whereas my friend could walk down the hallway and people would shout his name and recognize him. But with me, I always have to be the one that calls the name. Why? Am I trying too hard? Do I put people off for some reason? 

I always make a meaningless effort to have good body language, I always try to smile, I always have good hygiene/good looks. So what the fuck? Why doesn't anything work? I have tried taking on numerous friend's personalities that I see are successful and let me tell you that hasn't worked at all.

I tried being myself, and even though that did seem to produce the best results, people always seem to make a joke out of what I say or what I do. I don't understand, am I just naturally a fool and people can pick flaws out of what I do or what I say and get the group to laugh and put me down? Am I just cursed by fate and I'm one of the million people born into being the clown? Am I over thinking this too much?

I always think to myself ""Do people not like me or am I over thinking that they don't when they really do?"". It's so hard to tell. I also feel anxious talking to certain people that I deem as 'cool' because I think they don't want to associate with me, and then that makes me say stupid stuff and then they just take me as an idiot or they turn what I say into a joke. 

For most of my life I have felt like there is a class system in the schools I've been to. You have your kids that are losers and the kids that are 'cool' or 'popular'. And for a lot of my life, I've tried being one of those 'cool' or 'popular' kids, and while it's worked a little bit, I never feel satisfied with my current status. There is always another group that I crave to be accepted by. And I know a lot of you might think ""well that's just silly, not EVERYONE is going to like you"", but you see, there are some people I know that everyone DOES seem to like, and when I see those people I get so fucking jealous. Like what makes them so great that they can have the appeal of everyone else? It's horse shit.

I have found that I have gotten to be an extremely jealous person over the years. Jealous of my male friends that have had girlfriends or lost their virginity, because I have done absolutely shit with trying to hook up with a girl. I have been turned down literally like 5 or 6 times no joke. The only date I've ever had was with one of the biggest whores in the town my current school is located in, and even then I have to lie to people that we had a very short relationship, just so I can feel like I have some pride. I always tell myself ""Oh you'll get a girlfriend before so and so"" or ""So and so is so bad with girls, you'll definitely have a girlfriend before him"" but you know what, there are some really scummy or socially awkward kids that have had more pussy than I have ever gotten in my whole life. 

I always feel like I have to prove myself to others so I can be deemed as cool or someone people [I]want[/I] to know. I always feel like I have to put up this 'perfect' image so I won't lose my chances of people liking me. It really is a constant burden.

Not only that, but I feel myself hating myself more often. Like I feel sad or depressed more looking back on all the times I've failed in life or all the girls I've fucked up on that I really liked. I get jealous when I see my friends succeeding in things, and I find myself isolating myself from really shining and being important. It's like I crave to be accepted, but I'm too afraid or unmotivated to do something amazing to be noticed. I feel intimidated by people that are more popular than I am or people that have a lot of friends and are deemed as 'cool'. I don't want to believe that I have a depression illness because I don't want to be categorized as some sad sucker who is a loser and can't take life. But who knows? Maybe I am.

This is probably the biggest post about this problem I've ever made, and believe me, I've posted a lot of times before about this issue but in smaller amounts or about different things over the years. None of the times seemed to help me completely. I'm hoping this can be one of those times when I actually do find some serious advice. I know it's long but can someone please help me?

Fast forward a year later and I think I'm depressed because of the same incident--I need to meet with someone soon. I made an appt today and asked for a different counselor, which they were willing to give me. However, based on availability, Ted was the best fit for my schedule.

So what the hell, I thought, I booked an appointment with him this Friday. Now I'm kind of regretting it--but I don't want to wait later than that day to see anybody.

The thing is, Ted already knows my very complicated situation so it might be good not having to explain it all over again. But, last time I saw Ted I was a huge mess and all I could do was cry through the session. I associate him with that baggage and I'm not sure if it's good or bad to have had that experience with him.

I was out in a bar the other night with some 24 year old friend and I told him about this. When I told him why I didn't do it, he replied that I should have done it not for the sex or for the girl, but just to gain experience. I'd need that experience to get into a relationship with a girl I really like. 

Since the girl keeps hitting on me I wonder if I should go for it. I still don't feel comfortable with the though of having sex with someone I don't really know, and I am not sure if it's worth to throw over values for experience. 

So is this whole teenage-relationship thing just a super-mario game? Do I need to play this game in order to have a real relationship afterwards? Are others in my age to indifferent to controle their instincts, or do they really just have one night stands for experience?

C is my mom's aunt so she is blood related to me. L and C got married about 15 years ago. L has issues with alcohol and drugs. It reached a breaking point when C threatened to leave him about a year ago. He said that if C left him, he would kill himself. When she didn't back down, he purposefully OD'd on heroin. C agreed to stay with him if he went to rehab. He did. (Personal note: To me, it seems like she has been in a cycle of emotional abuse with him.)

He didn't get any better after rehab. Over the past 6 months, he has received 2 (maybe 3?) DUIs. One of them involved an accident in which he hit a parked car. His court date is in February for these incidents.

L and C hosted Christmas dinner this year. As soon as we arrived at the house, they began offering their belongings to us and alluded to ""moving"" out of the house. They kept stressing they needed to downsize. 

Eventually, the truth came out. They plan to move out of the country so he can avoid his jail time. He wants to move back to the country he is from, Lithuania. 

When my mom confronted C alone to try to find out what was going on, C said that he told her that he would ""kill himself before going to jail"". Long story short, she is being emotionally blackmailed to make this move with him. She feels trapped.

At one point, L asked me when my wedding was (March) and he said that they will not be attending. I asked when they would be leaving and he said ""next month"". So it seems to me that this is a pretty urgent matter.

Here are my questions/advice needed:
1) If she does this for my great uncle, will she be unable to enter the US again? Would this be considered harboring a fugitive?

2) Is there a way I can help C? If I go to the police, I have no concrete proof. He only verbally said that they were planning to leave the country.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm afraid that if this happens, I will never see my great aunt again. I am willing to intervene if it will mean helping my great aunt. I don't want to see L ruin her life any more than he already has.

What Can We Do To Help?,12,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/158z43/friend_has_negative_selfconfidence_what_can_we_do/,"I normally just lurk around on Reddit, but this has become a pressing enough issue for me to make a throwaway account to ask for your guys' help.

Alright, so I'm sure everyone here has already seen a low/no self-confidence cry for help before, maybe even given advice or tips to that person, but I think I may have a special case here. I need advice for me and my friends (Just to clarify, we're all university students, though of many different faculties and years) on how to help one of our friends out with ""negative"" self-confidence.

What do I mean by ""negative"" self-confidence? I mean that he can tell us with a straight face, or even with a smile, that he truly believes he is the most ""terrible"", worthless person on Earth (I have no idea what qualifies as terrible for him). It's confidence in being worth nothing. We don't understand at all: he's probably one of the most helpful guys in our group, really nice guy who never lets anyone down. He's fairly intelligent and has ridiculous drive; if he sees something needs to get done and it is in his or someone close to him's interest, he WILL get it done, ridiculously well at that. He has a strong sense of morals and goes out of his way to help people too, and still manages to get done whatever he was doing (Helped me and another friend with our 2 projects even though it was going to make him late for his, but he still finished it on time and he even got great marks). Appearance-wise, he's above-average, no extra fat, a little on the shorter side but not by much. Despite all this though, he can't take compliments at all, no matter who... he just laughs it off with a ""yeah, right"". He's mentioned that he ""just can't believe them"" or ""can't take them seriously"". Also, beyond handshakes and shoulder-patting, from what we've seen, he doesn't like being touched at all; he sort of automatically backs away any physical contact. The biggest thing though is like I mentioned before: by whatever standards he follows, he considers himself to be a failure, worthless, that he's rubbish at everything he does, and that whatever happens to him doesn't matter. He'll say this whenever we press him to take a compliment or try to bring up the subject of helping him with this problem.

Maybe we're shoving our noses where it doesn't belong, but it's really worrisome for us to know that he thinks this way about himself, and that maybe he's always thought about himself this way. We try to talk him into helping himself, and we're being honest when we tell him that we think that if he could think about himself positively, he could probably have as much money, women, and whatever else he wanted, that he's got ridiculous potential, but he just calmly says that he's not really interested in any of that. It's like he's living not for the sake of enjoying life, but just to get through it. We're not even sure what made him this way because he practically never talks about his past, but I mean what kind of terrible past can you have to make you think like this if you're only 20?

Really, any advice at all on how to help us convince this guy to get help/help himself would be nice. To be honest, we were thinking about dragging him to a psychologist or something at the beginning of next term, but we feel sort of bad about doing something so drastic when it's his personal problem.

1354395291.0,12,self.needadvice,1449hk,I feel like I can't afford life,16,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1449hk/i_feel_like_i_cant_afford_life/,"I feel like I can't afford life. I never really have been able to, but it has never been as pronounced as now. In a nutshell, I grew up poor, tried to go to a college that was too expensive for me when I was 17, got locked into about $16,000 of debt without graduating because of more money problems, and then went to work... doing low-wage jobs. I was a teenager and had never really been taught about finances. I am 25 right now and hindsight is 20/20. 

After getting out of my hometown which was in a huge economic slump, I came to NYC in 2007 for better job prospects (and in hopes to return to school).  In 2008 I met my then-future-husband, we became pregnant in 2009, and found out when we tried to get married that he did not have citizenship…IN ANY COUNTRY. He had lived his life thinking he had refugee status when he was actually stateless. There's no passport, no citizenship, and his parents were born in different disputed territories themselves, one also without citizenship anywhere. He came here as a small child and had no say in any of this. This caused a huge problem in our plans, but we did manage to get married despite the problems. However, it means that essentially his potential for work is limited to jobs with poor wages until everything is straightened out (he has a work permit, but does not have permanent resident status). We are trying to work through it, and $5,000 later we still are looking at possible years before he even has a shot at certain opportunities that could help our family. He is two years away from a Bachelor's degree, but we can't afford to pay it out of pocket. I have suggested CLEP for some courses, but even that's about $120 per test. 

So that being the case, the bread-winning responsibilities have been placed on me; however, I also did not complete college. So my potential wages are also pretty hard to live on for three people (plus my mother half of the time). We live in New York City, so it means that we cannot afford to live together in our own apartment. We do not qualify for public housing because of my husband’s strange immigration situation. This means that for nearly 3 years, I lived with his family in a 3 bedroom apartment that housed 6 people and a baby. This caused great stress, but I persevered.

In 2011, I returned to school and got a part-time job, and my husband got a $9 an hour full-time job.  At this point, I began going back and forth to my mother’s apartment in a public housing complex in order to study since I could not focus in a seven-person apartment. This means that for several days a week, I am in another part of town in the name of studying, away from family, in the hopes that all of this will pay off in the ability to get a job that will support the three of us. I haven't had a ""home"" in years. I have been going to school every fall, spring, and summer since 2011 and I am about a year away from graduation, but in the meantime I feel like I am deteriorating inside. I have had emotional breakdowns a few times at my old jobs (out of view of co-workers) due to this predicament. I also broke down many other times during studies, almost causing me to mess up my chances for school (fortunately, it has not yet). 

The most pressing issue right now isn’t my husband’s status or my debt, but just trying to live like a normal family. I want to know if there is any hope of a place we could go in which we would be able to live together and work decent wages in the condition that we are in right now, and if not decent wages, then at least housing affordability and feasible public transportation. We don’t have a car so many other cities probably aren’t options unless the transportation system is decently navigable.

I have tried multiple jobs and freelancing together in the past to make ends meet, but I haven’t even been able to logically fit in how I could work from 8-5 or 9-6 and then 7-12, sleep for 4-5 hours, and go to school all at the same time.  I also tried enlisting in the military, but the very student loan debt I incurred to try to get better job prospects is the reason I am disqualified from military service. At least the good news is I am a semester away from an Associate’s degree, so at least I might be able to work for a slightly more decent wage while I complete the Bachelor’s. I am trying to hone in on the skills I have right now so that maybe I'll have a better shot at livable wages. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on where we could go or what jobs we could take on to help us live like normal people?  I feel like I’m dying inside.  

TL; DR: After some really stupid decisions, we can’t afford rent for housing (at least in NYC) or to live like a normal family because we’re confined to low wages, at least until I graduate and until my husband gets permanent residence. We also don’t qualify for public housing or subsidized housing.  If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. We’re not bad people.

Also, please don’t reprimand me about “choices” or things that are already done and can’t be changed. I have enough mental anguish as it is. I need advice about where to go from here.

Because of my depression and anxiety and intense self-hate, going to the state university 50+ miles away from my family and friends was not the option that was best for me. The community college is my option for a year, so I can get the ground under my feet before transferring.

My best friend (a HS senior as well) and my boyfriend (a college freshman at the community college) are both in the same type of family situation as I, albeit the fact that their families can provide an economic safety net if need be. My boyfriend's family has also moved 50 miles away, so he will need a place to stay next year so he can stop paying extra for online classes. To transition ourselves into living away at college, we three have decided to try to rent an apartment a few minutes away from the college.

My family has never reached the poverty line. I am in the middle of putting in as many applications as possible. My best friend's seasonal job just closed down, and she's putting in for a new one currently. My boyfriend does work study at $8/hour, and is putting in for part time jobs in the area. 

We all have bank accounts, and will all have driver's licenses and cars by the end of this school year. 

As of right now, there are several two-bedroom townhouses/apartments in the area ranging from $375/month to $475/month available. I imagine some of the less expensive ones will be vacant by next year because of students completing credits and transferring.

Because of the move, the BF has a ton of extra furniture that needs to go somewhere, as do I. Between the three of us, we can basically furnish a place to live for under $100.

None of us have any credit (this is the main area we need advice and help) because the other two are very sheltered by their upper-class families, and my family is very simple-- I am a first generation college-student and my mother worked tobacco farms and wore handmade dresses when she was younger, to be frank. My mother often needs help doing with simple financial things and literally does not know how to keep herself out of the red.

Any and all advice is needed and much appreciated. Financial and apartment related is probably most needed, though.

So if this is not in the right place please feel free to say so and I can move it.

Now that, that is over I am really here to rant about my problems (no worries but I will get to the point of the title), but if any of you feel like you have a way of helping me or even some advice, you have no idea how much it would be appreciated.

I will start with some background, so you get a better idea of whats going on. I live in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, attending UW-Oshkosh and am pursing my degree in Hydrogeology. I have been in a unhealthy relationship with a girl named Ashley for 8 months now and it has been spiraling my life out of control. I do not blame her for what has happened to me but she has played some part. I love this girl with every breath I take but each time it has been slowly killing me. She has serious trouble dealing with her depression and most of time it falls upon me to help keep her up, which has been draining me physically, mentally, and financially. We were doing fine up, but then the day we started to move into our new apartment we were robbed. We lost most of our things and this was all due to our landlords leaving our apartment unlocked after leaving. We are now locked in a court battle with our landlord who refuses to pay for our damages, even though they are responsible for our losses. After this, Ashley refused to stay with me at the apartment and we end up splitting time at her moms in Appleton (which is 30 minutes away), and I spend the other time at the apartment. I have spoken with her and have spent a lot of money replacing our stolen belongings and fixing the apartment, while trying to convince her to come back to the apartment. I will be the first to admit that the apartment is not the best but I have done everything I can to make it what she wants but she still will not give in. I am at loss with what to do and I feel hopeless about the situation getting any better.  

So with this taking up so much of my time, I have been letting other things get out of had. Each time I try to spend more time on my class work, Ashley breaks down on me the moment I start to spend less time with her, and she has not control over what she is doing. So I neglect what I should be doing and come to her aid. I have spent all my money trying to make her happy and give her the things she wants but only now do I see that this was never helping. My grades are at an all low, I won't have enough money to pay rent, and I feel worthless inside cause I can't make the one person I love happy.  

This is Ashley and I.
http://imgur.com/aEL1g

After all of this I have finally found the will to get help and I have been talking to a therapist for the past week now. I have also talked to Ashley about what has been going on and she has acknowledged somethings but overall wishes to stay ignorant to what is going on. She has agreed to start talking her meds again as well as starting to see her therapist. We remain together though distance now but I am still unsure if seeing her is the right choice, seeing as I need to start focusing on my college career.

So now I am at my biggest problem and that is being able to staying in college. I have talked with my teachers and I will be doing my best with trying to salvage what is left of my semester in the hopes of getting a passing grade. This will be hard but what I am truly worried about is my finical situation, which since I will not be able to make rent, my landlord will evict me and I will be forced to move back home. My parents live two hours away and since I have no place to stay in Oshkosh I will not be able to continue in college. My landlords will jump at the first possible chance to get rid of me, because of how much money they actually owe me. I have talked to my lawyer and he sees really no way around this.

Now I know all of you are thinking, why don't you ask your family for help. I really wish I had a stable family to fall back on for finical help but I don't. My parents are in over 300,000 dollars of debt and my dad's wages are garnished. So give me more than 20 bucks will cause them to miss house payments. My brother and sister are also college students with no money to give me either. There is also no extend family from which to talk to get some help from. I am already 50,000 dollars in debt due to college and nobody will ever touch me to give me another loan, even so I couldn't afford the payment. I feel isolated and alone, so that is why I have come here to rant and see if there is anyone out there who can give me a shred of advice or even a dollar.

I am sorry for anyone who had made it this far, my head is a mess and I know this doesn't really flow right but neither does the thoughts in my head. All I can say is thank you for reading this.

For anyone who wants to contact me with some advice, or just wants to know more you can email me at maasj99@uwosh.edu or send me a message on here as well. If you feel like you can spare a dollar or two, that is also linked to my paypal account. I hate asking for a hand out but I desperate and I don't want to be a burden on society for all my life.

Thank you all for reading and here is me with a time stamp. (I know some people like these sort of things.)

1345942637.0,9,self.needadvice,ytylf,My family is having trouble coping with surgeries and fighting. Any help?,11,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ytylf/my_family_is_having_trouble_coping_with_surgeries/,"Don't worry, there's a tl;dr somewhere in this wall of text.

 I need some advice on how to deal with my grandmother's chemo and radiation treatment, as well as ways to help my mom more comfortable with her new bag. My mom has always been the care taker of the house and is a horrible worrier. She's been incredibly depressed ever since my uncle has moved in because of his lack of respect for her and my grandmother through drinking and leaving the house a total mess 24/7. She's even more depressed because of being just plain uncomfortable with the colostomy bag. She'd like to go to the football games and watch me march, but she's confused on what to wear, and embarrassed about the noises her bag makes. Her stoma is right below her ribs, so she's concerned this means it won't be easy to hide, as opposed to the stoma regularly being around the waist.


 As far as my grandmother's situation; my family, aside from my mom, is pretty much no help. We've never had traces of breast cancer before, so this is a whole new experience. My grandmother just had her first round of chemo treatment earlier this week, and we can definitely tell the effects are starting to hit her. I've already read up on a few ways to help her through this process, like no food smells, (this is horribly hard. The only thing my recently moved in uncle deems himself worthy of doing around the house is cook, and when he does; he stinks up the house. He's got such a bad temper, I can't tell him this, because then he'll just blow up make everyone's lives even worse.) not treating her differently but still looking out for her, etc. I just want to know if there's anything else I should know, or any other way a 15-year-old freshman girl can help.


 However, as I've mentioned throughout this and in the title, you can tell my uncle has been the cause of a lot of unnecessary fighting. He's been living off of us for about a year now, along with my 2 year old cousin. He doesn't do anything to contribute the family or the house aside from cook. He has a job as a referee for soccer, but he only makes enough to pay for the gas to get him to his games. The reason for him moving in is a relationship that went bad, and him deciding his best bet would be to move in with his mom/us. However, after the drama from his ruined relationship, he's turned to drinking, causing beer cans and disrespect everywhere. Especially with my mom. They're constantly fighting, and with all the stress of me starting school again, her getting her bag, and my grandmother's cancer, this is last thing she needs. My mom already called the cops on my uncle, and has threatened to forcefully remove him from the household at least once a month. My uncle won't listen to her or anyone else but my grandmother, but even she can't get him to leave, because that would mean the baby would have to leave, too. This is something that our family cannot handle at the moment.


 Oh, and here's a few things that I probably should mention: My uncle has realized that nobody in the family can probably take care of the baby (he would dump him on me, but I'm usually gone because of band camp and other school things), so he's decided to let his son move in, although this was only supposed to last for a month. His son and himself also fight constantly.


 My uncle wouldn't even have the baby if his daughter wasn't involved in drugs and hadn't already had a child beforehand.


**tl;dr My mom has a colostomy bag, my grandmother has breast cancer, and my uncle is a freeloading, drunk jerk that likes to fight with everyone and can get away with it because he's taking care of a baby.**

I don't know if this is stupid or self-indulgent, but I don't really have anyone else I can talk to about this. I'm a scientist fresh out of graduate school, moved to NYC about a year ago and working my first research job at a university in the greater metropolitan area. I **love** my job and my research, I'm living my dream that I had since I was a little kid. Things are going great professionally, and I feel like I have it pretty good and shouldn't be feeling this way, especially given how bad many other people have it. In fact I almost feel like an asshole just posting this, I know everyone has problems.

Introspective self-diagnosis isn't exactly my strong suit, but I'm pretty sure I'm becoming depressed, and I don't know how to deal with it. Like I said work is great, but it stopped feeling quite as great, even though I know it is and it's still exciting, but it somehow doesn't reach me anymore. Other things I love to do don't seem to get through either, I'm just sad really often. 

At first I thought I just worked too much (I'm pretty sure I have OCD, but that's basically a job requirement), so I tried to cut back from 70-80 hour weeks to something a bit more sustainable. That reduced the instances of crushing despair that are the familiar side-effects of extreme and total mental exhaustion, but doesn't seem to have addressed the basic issue. After a lot of thought I've reached the (embarrassingly obvious) conclusion that I'm just lonely. Even though I maintain very meaningful friendships abroad with people I've met over the years, I don't really have any friends in the city and I'm not sure how to make some that I can relate to. (Because I live fairly far away from the university, work-friends aren't really available in that sense.)

I joined a martial arts academy and go regularly, and it does help with life-balance and stops me from obsessively pulling 14+ hour days too many times a week, which is good, but even though everyone there is awesome I feel alienated from other people. As soon as you're the scientist you become this larger-than-life curiosity that gets quizzed about sciency questions (which is fine) but beyond that people don't know what to do with you, and it's mutual. I crave human connection but don't seem to be able to find it. I tried online dating, but decided I should get the rest of my house in order before looking for another relationship, and it just ended up being a tedious and expensive way to get laid every now and then, with no real human connection. I don't want to go on medication because this depression is a clear signal that there's something wrong with my life that I have to fix. I feel as powerless against it as any chemical imbalance, but given my past history and temperament I just don't think it's an innate psychiatric problem, beyond the fact that my upbringing &amp; training doesn't seem to have prepared me for building up a balanced life while doing research. 

I don't know what to do, or what I'm even asking exactly. How can you meet people in a big city? Any advice in general? I dunno. Thanks for reading though.",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_ry6ez,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ry6ez/depressed_scientist_needs_probably_obvious_advice/,

One thing I have noticed is that in a lot of cases, I end up being nearly silent around my coworkers. Part of it is probably aspergers (diagnosed when I was rather young but majorly improved since then), and some of it anxiety for various reasons. I deal with customers just fine, with the occasional hurdle of course. But I don't have much relation with my coworkers at all. How abnormal am I?

I'd used to be extremely nervous, but I got benzo meds for the anxiety which help a lot (although dependence could be a concern). I'm a lot calmer but rarely carry on conversations with people that I'm not well acquainted with. 

This is evident at a customer service job that I recently started. What worries me is that (supposedly) they have a policy that the first 3 months are an evaluation period to find if the employee a good fit, but I don't know how serious it is. I'm worried they will fire me because I don't fit in. I really need this job to pay my bills and don't know what I will do without it.

For quite a while I have questioned my ability to sustain gainful employment. I don't want to live like this. It's bad enough that it fucks up my ability to socialize. And please don't take this as a ""suicidewatch"" remark...but if this persists it might just make me go from having thoughts about the eventual possibility of suicide to driving a bullet into my fucked up brain.

This has caused significant problems for making friends too especially since I haven't lived here long. But right now, I am worried about paying bills.

I have been taking meds, but I should see a psychologist to discuss this with. Went to the counseling center at school but they keep bullshitting me, it's nearly 2 months now that I have been waiting.

I really don't know what I'm doing.,10,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ow5iy/i_graduated_a_month_ago_and_havent_started/,"I graduated a month ago with a MS in electrical engineering, but my job search basically hasn't started yet. I blame the redditor cocktail, a mix of procrastination, no motivation, no ambition, laziness, procrastination, confidence issues, social anxiety and oh god the procrastination.  It's not that I've decided I shouldn't be looking for a job, it's just that I end up procrastinating before I can ever finish anything related to a job search.

Other than just ""how do I force myself to focus on this,"" I probably need the most advice in finding references. I'm at a complete loss for how to ask, especially considering I haven't talked to any of my potential references for at least a year. First amongst said potentials are the professors of classes I did well in.  In most cases, I would only occasionally speak out in class to answer or ask a question, but never went to office hours, so I'm not sure if they would remember me. My best option might be one of the professors I was a teaching assistant for, but I still need to figure out the best way to ask given that I haven't had any contact with him for about two years.

Before I get to the next one, it's time for a brief story. I actually signed up to grad school as a PhD candidate. To that end, I signed with ""Dr.Smith"" as my graduate advisor and worked as a research assistant for him for three semesters. The first two semesters I didn't do that bad, but I had absolutely no work ethic left for the third, so Dr.Smith let my contract expire. I can't blame my laziness on him, but I will say his constant angry mood and belittling of his grad students didn't help me find any motivation, but did help me discover that I have a fragile ego.

Okay, back to my next potential reference, ""Dr. Jones."" I did very well in his IC design classes; I frequently had the highest test grade and was very vocal during lecture. I even went to his office hours occasionally, so I know that at one point he had a good opinion of me. The trouble is he is close friends with Dr. Smith, the spiteful, ill-tempered former boss of mine who has legitimate reason to disparage my ability to work as an engineer. And this is another guy I haven't talked to for a year. I know I really should have contacted him earlier, but, well, chalk it up to another case of me ruining my life by way of excessive procrastination.

""Dr.Awesome"" is what I'll call the next guy, because he is freaking awesome. He actually teaches at the university I got my BS from, and I'm not sure how common it is for a grad student to have an undergrad professor as a reference, but again, he's awesome. I'd wager that most redditors would idolize him after reading his Wikipedia or IMDb page, but linking that would make me too identifiable to anyone that knows me as I talk about him every chance I get. It is worth mentioning that his accomplishments, while being significantly more than enough to get a campus building named after him, are not in the field of electrical engineering, which is really just his hobby. He is definitely the reason I got into circuit design. And just like with Dr.Jones above, I did extremely well in his courses. I had also gotten a letter of recommendation from him when I applied to grad school. But again the problem is I've had no contact with him for three years and I just have no idea what to say at all.

I've also been thinking about for hire services that might help me find a job.  I've considered headhunters and looked at a few webpages for resume-writing services, but I have no idea if I found companies with good resume writing or just good SEO. If anyone knows anything about those kinds of places, I would really appreciate some help in picking one out.

So that's all I can think of for now. If there are any more details you want, please ask, I think just talking about it some could be helpful. Thanks for reading. But if you didn't...

tl/dr- Recent MSEE grad has procrastinated for a month on starting a job search.

I'm in my early 20s and have had depression/anxiety for a VERY long time. I was in a really horrible place when I started college, and really relied on my parents for help. They were great when I needed to vent, needed to cry, etc. Last winter I finally decided to get psychiatric help (I'd been bucking it forever.) My psychiatrist and I decided that medication was a good option, and I began trying different things to see what worked best. But I had a terrible reaction to one dosage and became extremely anxious. I was plagued by gruesome images of my own suicide. Afraid I'd harm myself, I phoned my parents and they flew up to my college to calm me down. I was too afraid to go to my college mental health services, because once you mention ""suicide,"" they really start recommending you take time off (I know, I still should have gone, blah.) Anyway, long story short, my parents stuck by my side as I phoned my shrink, got a new prescription, and bounced right back to normal.

That was almost a year ago. Today, I'm extremely happy, I've made a bunch of new friends, I've traveled, and I'm on my way to grad school (!) next year. For the first few weeks after my episode, my parents insisted I check in with them multiple times a day (I understood, and wasn't bothered by it.) I expected that over time they'd loosen the leash and we'd go back to our call-once-a-day deal. 

BUT when I don't call them as often as they like, they get extremely anxious and tell me ""not to do that to them,"" even if I've been in class all day. And every time I do call them (a few times a day, believe it or not) I feel like I'm back in triage. ""Are you okay? Are you in good spirits? Are you taking your medication?"" I don't mind that they ask, but it dominates the conversation. If I want to, say, gossip about the Bachelor, I can't because I'm too busy spewing ""I'm fine. Really. Why would I lie about this? Yes I feel good."" And heaven forbid there's a day when I feel like shit because of xyz and I tell them - they'll keep me on the phone for EVER convincing them I'm not going to off myself.

It's exhausting. I'm obviously better in every way, my achievements over the past year are a testament to that. AND why are they so worried I'm hiding my true feelings? I've always been candid about how I feel, and they know that!

I guess what I'm asking is, how do I tell my parents to loosen up, without coming off like I'm asking them to butt out of my life? Because I'm not!

I hope this is the right subreddit for those kind of questions...

I recently turned 19 and i`ve been thinking alot about my mental status. I just seem to not be able to open myself to other people or to be in any kind of relationship.

Maybe its connected to my rather unusual childhood. I`ve never seen my parents kiss or act like if they were actually together. 

My dad died when I was 8, after that my mum told me that she had been having a strong psychosis since long before me and my brother were born. This explained alot of strange things for me, since I e.g. never understood why my dad didnt live with us, in the same apartment, but somewhere upstairs in another apartment, eventhough we were in the same house. So I actually got raised by my parents, who loved eachother, but my mum just couldnt live together with my dad because of her psychosis. 

Just shortly after that my grandmother and grandfather died, who were like my second mother and father to me and I fell into a really deep hole. I was really popular in kindergarten, but after that I just isolated myself. My brother also suffered alot from the death of my father and actually got overweight and failed class. My mom tried her best to offer us some kind of normal live, but her psychosis really got onto her, I often found her crying alone at night.

Long story short, I feel like I never learned what it means to be in a relationship or how to show actual feelings. I just cant open myself to other people, it seems impossible to me. I cant show other people my true feelings. This takes effect on family friends and ( potential) girlfriends.

I`m not saying i lack opportunities ( im quite handsome ) , its just I cant truly commit myself to another person.

I ask you guys for help, if theres any kind of advice you can give me to help me open up myself and fully commit and trust into other persons. 


Actually its quite hard to describe what my real problem is, but I tried my best to kind of explain it, I hope you can understand at least a little bit what I`m going through.

He can not drive so I pick him up from his house, we head to my house and play xbox all day. Its a good time and I enjoy the excuse to play video games for a few hours. 

The problem is that he calls me every day wanting to hang out. Every single day. Even if we make arrangements to hang out lets say next friday he will call in the days leading up to that day to make sure. If he calls and I say I can't hang out he kind of gets sad and has trouble understanding why. It is very difficult to get off the phone with him and I feel like its upsetting him when I am unavailable to hang out so sometimes I just ignore the call and that makes me feel like a piece of crap...

I am trying to be a good person by spending time with him and I'm not looking for a medal here like I said its enjoyable. I could use some advice on how to communicate. Any ideas or suggestions? I have no knowledge on how to work with someone who has special needs, I'm just trying to do what I think is right.

Is this situation fair?,13,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/nl48r/renting_a_room_from_a_friend_is_this_situation/,"Hi Reddit! Throwaway here, for obvious reasons. I make no apologies for length - the ladies love it - I hope it doesn't put you off having a read and offering me a little advice.

I, along with my flatmate/friend/landlord, graduated from University in the summer. He did significantly better than I, and therefore has a pretty well paying graduate job which pays him enough to get a mortgage. For the past few months I have been living in the spare room in his flat (that's apartment for USians). I just wanted to see if any other redditors are in similar situations and whether you think our current arrangement is fair on both parties.

Now for the details:

- My friend owns the flat leasehold, and has a mortgage. Value of property is roughly £60,000 (so fairly small).

- We split the water/heating/electricity/tv bills 50/50, with the exception of some of the extra TV packages which I would never have wanted. 50/50 seems about right. I probably use more during the week, being unemployed, but as his girlfriend visits every weekend it probably evens out.

- We split the cost of the mortgage 50/50. Of course my flatmate is the only one who will see any return on this investment as I'm just paying it as rent. Of course he reminds me that the majority of the money paid just goes into killing the interest.

- Total cost to me is roughly £80/week. The flat is recently refurbished and only ten minutes walk from the city centre, but in a relatively poor part of town. In comparison, when I rented a house in my second year at university (from an estate agent), we were able to get a small house in an awesome location, paying £66/week without bills - this house, however, was not in a great condition and did have a fair bit of mould. Housemates there did not include my current flatmate.

- Our bedrooms are roughly equal size. His is slightly larger and has a floor-to-ceiling window but this is the only real difference. We share the living-room/kitchen and bathroom.

- We share cleaning/cooking duties. There's been some friction on this in the past, but over the last month or so it's gone fairly smoothly.

- The furnishings in the shared areas are his. I can use his Xbox360 and sit on his nice expensive sofa etc. Everything in my room is my own, about £600 from IKEA in total...

------

So, Reddit. That's half of it. Do you think this current deal is financially fair? I don't think I'm getting ripped off at all, but my flatmate does seem to think he's doing me some sort of charitable service when I'm pretty sure I'm paying near the market rate.

-----

Now the other half is the issue of having guests. Now when it comes down to it, legally he gets to decide who's allowed in the flat. The flat is his and I have not signed any contract. He is not, however, according to the tendency agreement, allowed to sublet — but I figure this is more to stop the whole flat being rented out, rather than the spare room. I pay in cash.

Obviously as it is his flat, he has guests. His girlfriend visits every weekend, usually Friday to Sunday, but sometimes from Thursday. In the past few months he's had some uni friends stay once, some friends from work pop over for some xbox and pizza and, of course, his parents. So you get the picture, apart from his girlfriend, it's not often, but it does happen.

On the other hand, he expects me to *ask for permission* to bring any guests home, whether it be day or night and whether or not they might be staying the night. I personally feel that when we're splitting all costs that this is a bit of a big ask. If I'm going to have them in the shared living room, informing him in advance would be a nice gesture, but I don't feel it should be required. I also feel that if someone comes back to my room and doesn't bother him, then that's of no concern to him. The current situation makes me feel rather like a teenager trapped at home with his parents, rather than a man in his early(ish) twenties.

My flatmate's concerns range from the possibility that guests who turn up late with me after a few beers may disturb his sleep, to the possibility that guests could completely trash the place. The latter rather offends me - I am not friends with the sort of people who would do such a thing. The former is a genuine concern, I admit. My counterargument is that whenever I have come home drunk on a night out while living with him, I have not woken him up as I have been quiet and considerate. On the other hand, I had to babysit him after he returned from a work party last week, until he was able to get to sleep, and then got up after six hours sleep to call him in sick for work...

-----

So Reddit, what do you think? Have you lived under similar circumstances? Am I expecting too much leniency from my housemate? I await your wisdom. Thank you.

I'll try to summarize as best as possible so that you're not reading a wall of text:

- Have good admin job where I work from home 99% of the time.
- Pay is ""decent"" (a little lower than the average I see on all those salary websites)
- Been offered a new job with a 20% bump in pay.  Job is basically the same as the current one I have.

My dilemma is that I really like my current job and love working from home.  I get to see my new daughter grow up, I can work in my pajamas, and I don't have to spend hours a day commuting.  When I did all the math (gas from having to commute, some other things, etc...), this new job (even though it's 20% more pay) ends up being about ~300 extra dollars a month.  Nothing to sneeze at, but also not enough to make this a no brainer.

My initial feeling right now is to pass on the new job and stick with the current one, but that leads into the downsides of the current one:

- probably won't last forever.  A lot of my responsibilities are being slowly moved over to the headquarters in Texas.  I often have a lot of free time during the day now (didn't use to happen), and while that seems awesome, it also makes me feel very expendable.  I generally trust the company I work for and think the owners/management to tend to respect the employees and do their best to keep everyone employed (there are people with ""jobs"" here that haven't really had a job for years, but because management doesn't want to fire them, they get moved to like... I don't even know how to describe it... made up positions?), so I don't think anyone is actively looking for a way to get rid of me, but at the same time, I worry that attitude may eventually change.

What would you do?  Stick with the current, slightly less profitable job where I work from home?

My parents had me young. They've both been alcoholics and drug addicts for most of my life. My parents split before I was born. I lived with my mom most of the time, saw my dad for a week maybe twice a year. 

Fast forward to now. I'm an adult (23 y/o) completely self-sufficient. I've never had to ask for money or any sort of help or aide since moving out two and a half years ago. The only help I get from my parents is I'm on my mom's insurance plan. Other than that, I talk to my dad maybe twice a year and my mom maybe once a month. 

I've realized the following : 
- My mom seems to avoid my phone calls. I'll call her house and cell, and text her, but the phone goes unanswered. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't *every single time I've tried calling*. 

- She obviously favors my brothers. My middle brother is in prison and she makes the 45-minute drive once a week to give him shampoo, but I have to twist her arm to get her to spend time with me on my birthday. 

- I own my own business and have done so successfully, as my sole source of income, for two years. She still asks if my boyfriend, who has a desk job, can get me a ""real job"". 

- She'll make plans, birthday lunches or the like, and 80% of the time flake out and cancel, with poor excuses. 

- She's never outwardly mean but she makes jokes, comments, remarks that can't be taken as anything but insulting. If I react, she'll tell me to lighten up. 

Despite all this, I still get nervous when I know I'm going to see her, because I want to impress her, to become valid in her eyes somehow.  The more I think about cutting off contact with her, even temporarily, the more I'm convinced this will be a huge weight off my shoulders.

So in my younger years, I was a spammer (I sent advertisement messages on social networks and made a commission.)

Also, another hacker friend sent me some bank account info, which I never used, but I kept them. I was raide d by the feds and later indicted with possession of stolen info and violation of the CAN spam act. I realize what I had done was dumb.

I was actually turned down as a cart pusher at Walmart just for having a non-related felony record. I have so many dreams and aspirations of becoming a successful programmer or opening up a Web developer/network security research company. I have been told by many people that I am a very bright person, and can do anything. But no one will give me a second chance.  I often think about how I should just commit suicide because I can never be happy or reach any of my goals. 

What should I do? Is suicide my only option? Or is there a way I can start my own biz with no money, or get some kind of job so I can save up to run my own biz?

I am extremely fortunate that my parents can support me, so I don't mean to whine or complain, I'm in a really good position. However, they pretty much forced me into trying out computer science, saying they'll kick me out if I refuse. Yikes. I honestly have little to no background in programming or the likes, and even less interest in the subject.

Well, I was right. To sum it up, I still have zero interest in programming, don't enjoy it at all, and as expected, it's quite a challenge.

I'm always honest about my intentions and I make sure before we sleep together that the girl knows that I'm not interested in a relationship other than just having some fun.

They say that for the most part they actually enjoyed it, a lot of their clients were just normal guys and not creeps, etc etc. This fascinates me and I start looking up escorts in my area. I spend several hours reading reviews and such and finding the right girls and making a list.

So far I've seen two different girls. The first one was pretty good. The girl was really friendly, very hot, and the sex felt great. Parts of it felt off but I was expecting that... I'm paying for sex after all.

The second one was fantastic. The girl was adorable and she got REALLY into it. The off feeling from the first one wasn't here, maybe because the girl genuinely seemed to enjoy me, maybe because I wasn't as nervous, I don't know. It felt natural, though, and left me wanting more.

So now I'm reflecting on the whole thing and wondering if I'm crazy. I don't think I'd feel comfortable telling any of my real life friends about this so I came here.

Why am I paying for sex when I could easily call up one of my FWB's for free? 

Is what I'm doing wrong? Am I hurting these girls by participating? They're independent and well off, it's not like they're forced into it. And I treated them very well. Still, it's fucking prostitution. Despite these former escorts on reddit saying it's nothing to feel bad about, I can't help but think I should feel guilty, like I'm exploiting them.

He is not ready for either.

I've considered my two options: leaving him OR having patience that he will come around eventually. Either way, it will cause me pain and sadness. And either way, I will not get married or have children any time soon.

Since I live in a very small town, and pretty far away from any ""big city"" I am limited to this one provider, and I was put in with a licensed counselor. 

My problem: My first appointment was last Friday 5/20. As I understood it on the phone, I was told my appointment was at 2:30, and I was to download the intake paperwork from their website and complete it beforehand. So, I show up at 2:15 with paperwork in hand, and they tell me that my appointment isn't until 3:15 - they just told me 2:30 in case I hadn't completed the paperwork.  

Ok, misunderstanding, so I wait around until 3:15... 3:20... finally, around 3:35, the counselor finishes with his previous patient and comes out to get me.  I don't remember if I got my full 45 minutes or now, but I was his last appt of the day so I am assuming I did. He did apologize for being late, and I figured it was just one of those things. 

This Friday 5/27 was my next appointment.  I  made it for 12:15 so I could go on my lunch hour, and I was planning to be back to work shortly after 1pm.  I waited until 12:30 and finally decided to leave. I told the receptionist that I didn't have time to wait, so she said she'd cancel my appointment.  No ""sorry he's running late"" or anything.   

I understand that when dealing with patients, schedules are subject to change, but I'm kind of feeling a bit disrespected here. I understand I'm there for counseling so maybe they don't think I'm worth the effort, but I'm still a paying customer and thus I feel I deserve some modicum of service and respect. 

How many more chances do I give them before I just stop going?  There isn't another outpatient provider within a ~40 mile radius, so traveling elsewhere isn't an option right now. Am I blowing this out of proportion or is it possible that I'm dealing with an unprofessional business and I'm just wasting my time and money?

&lt;preface&gt;

I've been a redditor for about a year now.  I've laughed, I've cried, and I've rage-faced with you all. I've seen reddit help so many people that it has given me hope for myself.  I comment a lot, but I've never actually posted anything.  So please forgive any bad reddiquette.  I promise I am not here for karma or for pity, I just need some advice.

&lt;\preface&gt;

I am concerned that I am not completely psychologically stable.


I think to properly explain myself, a little context is necessary.
  
I'm 21 years old, female.  I have a genetic history of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder on my paternal side. Also, I have been diagnosed with complex partial epilepsy, but I'm not sure if that is relevant.

I have never been officially diagnosed with depression, but I have attempted suicide 2 times, the first time I was 9 years old, the second time I was 16.  I don't think that my depression is because of a genetic disorder or chemical imbalance, I think it is because of a ridiculous childhood, but I am not a doctor. Also, I am NOT considering suicide right now, to be clear.

The things I find disconcerting at the moments are:

-I don't sleep regularly.  I usually only sleep for a couple hours a night.  Sometimes though, I won't get out of bed for an entire weekend.

-When I do sleep I have nightmares.  Every night, without fail. I am always being murdered, held captive, and/or chased.  Usually I am being held underwater.  Usually by the same person.  This has not helped my insomnia, as it is difficult to sleep when you know this is what is in store for you.  Does anyone else have nightmares every night?  Is this something that is normal?

-Most of the time, I am very detached.  I don't get overly emotional in situations.  For example, my cousin (who I was very close to) committed suicide last summer.  I was living in British Columbia at the time, helping my older brother detox from an oxycontin addiction.  He said he needed to come home, so I moved us both about 4000km (2500ish miles, I think) home to be with our family.  It's been nearly a year, and I haven't cried.  I don't actually remember the last time I really cried.  I have shed maybe 3 tears since then (I am a master of the single-tear, though). Isn't it normal to cry over these things?

-When I feel too much emotion, I feel nauseous.  Like I am going to throw up.  I didn't notice this until recently.  

-Sometimes when I daydream, it's seems more like a hallucination.  I'm not sure this is an easy one to put into words.  It's like I can't always control it and I don't notice anything else going on around me.  Usually, I wake up to someone saying, ""Hello? Did you hear what I just said?""  
Is this normal?

I have never told anyone most of what is posted above.  Most of the people in my life would tell you that I am the happiest person they know, I think.

I guess what I am asking is, does this sound like depression, or something more? If it is depression, I think I can deal with it, but if it's something more I'm not sure what to do.

Also, do crazy people know they are going crazy?

I am incredibly uncomfortable with all emotions, so I am not sure how I would approach this subject with anyone.  The only people I know who are more uncomfortable with emotions than me, are most of my family.  I don't know anything about therapy, or how to find that kind of help in my area, if that is what I need to do.

I hope this was clear. I'd be very grateful for anyone's opinion or advice.  Feel free to ask me anything that will be helpful.



**EDIT:  It was mentioned that I should say in my post the the person chasing/trying to kill me in my dreams is a man that molested me as a child.  He was my mom's boyfriend, so it happened on multiple occasions. I didn't tell anyone because I didn't think they would believe me (as it turns out I was wrong).  Eventually it was my grandma who found out, and she asked me to go to the police.  He plead guilty in court, as there were other girls involved as well.  I never had to see him after my grandma took me away.  I have a hard time talking about this, but you're probably right Reddit, it might seem a bit like a troll without it.  Thank you all so much for all your thoughtful responses.  I'll start responding to them now.**



TL;DR: History of crazy in my family with symptoms of depression + some.  Advice?

maintaining enough free time to develop new skills?",13,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/fh8ak/how_can_i_support_myself_financially_while_still/,"Background: 23 years old, male, German, have lived in Germany all my life.

I have held various full time jobs over the past few years. Mostly menial, low-level work. Time and time again, i found that being occupied with work for upwards of 8 hours a day, 5 days a week does not leave me with enough free space. It had a suffocating effect on other a areas of my life.

My last job ended a few months ago, and i made the decision to take some off time. I have been using this opportunity to really think about what i want my future to look like. This was long overdue.

I now know what i want, and that i'm going to need free time for it. A few examples of things i want to do:

* gain a deeper understanding of music theory
* learn to play the piano
* become good at using high-end video editing software (Vegas, Premiere or FCP)
* learn how to program
* learn about databases (very exciting, i know)
* learn how to physically defend myself
* learn how to express myself better in public speaking, writing and just general conversation

The list goes on. Besides really wanting achieve these goals just because i know it will be fun and fulfilling to do so, i also see many of them as things i can see myself making money with in the future.

If this seems overly optimistic, please know that the best way for me to learn things has always been the autodidactic way. Surely some of you can relate.

So that's where my question comes from: How can i support myself financially, and still have enough free time and energy to develop new skills?

More relevant information:

* I still live with my parents, but it's time to finally move out and become fully financially independent.
* I can see myself putting up to three ~8 hour days a week into a menial, make-ends-meet job. More than that is pushing it.
* Not afraid of living a frugal lifestyle for a while. I don't have many needs anyways. Don't need a car or a big place to live, don't need to party on the weekends, no other big regular expenses.
* I have about 12,000€ in savings (that's $16,340).
 
The best answer i have come up with so far:

* Move into a cheap studio apartment. (roughly 200€ to 350€ per month around here)
* Get a part-time job that covers the monthly expenses and leaves me with enough free time. If it doesn't cover expenses and i can't devote more time to it, i'll draw from my savings.
* Do my thing.

This is just an idea and i'm not sure if it would work. I also don't know if the math works out on that; i'll find out. I don't want to run my savings dry after a year. I want a sustainable situation.

Living with my parents for a little longer is also an option, but i'd rather avoid it. It would be cheaper though.

So, what are your suggestions? Perhaps you've been in a similar place, or know someone that has been? Or do you think i should be approaching this from a different angle?

**tl;dr: I want to change significant parts my life in order to be happier, but i'm unsure about practical aspects. Good advice would really help me out.**

(If you're asking yourself why i don't just go to school for one of my interests, seeing how interested i am in learning: It's not out of the question. But for now, i wouldn't know what to focus on. Also i am currently not qualified for university in Germany, and obtaining qualification is realistically not an option right now.

I'd still like to be within a 2 hour drive from a big city (well mostly my wife would like that, we're compromising).

Considering that it's next to impossible to apply my current work skills to a job I could perform from home, what do you suggest my long term strategy should be like?",,False,,t5_2r367,False,,,True,t3_ewijx,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ewijx/i_want_out_of_the_city_and_into_as_rural_a_place/,

I'd get pats on the back and gold stars in school. I like to always have a sense of accomplishment and progress towards some goal.

This all ended the exact moment I finished college.

The perfect analogy is saying that I'm the worst player in MLB. However, if you sent me back down to the Minors, they'd send me back to the Majors where I would be the worst player again. And this is inevitably my biggest problem. On paper I should be working for some white shoe finance or consulting firm and be really good at it, but I suck at these tedious, mind-numbingly boring jobs.

I wanted to start my business senior year of college. I was wooed to a Wall Street job, and figured I'd work for 2 years and bank the bonus and use that money to start a company. I was really bad at my job, but I don't know how much was imagined versus me being actually bad. Up until that point I never failed at anything. Upon getting the job I was moved to a think tank group, on the first day. I had no choice in the matter. I have no idea why anyone thought I was that capable/smart to begin with. I hate math, I only did well because I STUDIED MY ASS OFF, not because it was second nature to me like others in the group. Had they kept me in the job I applied for and got, I would have been okay. Not a rockstar, but I wouldn't have felt like the biggest idiot in the room almost everyday. I was able to keep up but didn't innovate or add any true value besides a mechanical understanding of what the hell was going on. But even still I couldn't help but make countless careless mistakes. At one point I was so nervous I couldn't fill out the the number $500,000,000 on a form because I thought I was going to screw it up. It took me 5 tries to fill out a simple form because I was under so much anxiety. After a year I quit before I was fired, and got another job at a Fortune 500. At this point my confidence was pretty low.

At this new company I did better, but I realized that I don't function well in the corporate environment. Small talk (college football, golf, tennis) was not interesting to me; corporate policies and red tape made no sense to me; many meetings I felt were pointless and I made this objection by inadvertently nodding to sleep; I didn't ""howdie doo!"" the right people; I'm in the South and everybody just seemed so different and conservative-- someone almost had a screaming match with me about global warming not being real; my first manager had a terrible reputation in the company, which did not help me get any visibility. Two years into this job there is a shake up and I get placed with a new manager who is former child prodigy, and his boss who was Einstein reincarnate. The analogy to this would be holding a candle (me) to the binary star of Alpha Centauri (my manager and our director). I think this hurt me in the sense that in any other group I would have gotten better reviews, which means a promotion, and more money. But with this group I was just average. Or the worst performer of the 3. So my reviews are showing up as me being an average employee as I'm being rated compared to my superstar counterparts. Where as other analysts in our sister group who were doing (and I'm being honest) much easier assignments were getting rave reviews and promotions. The VP wasn't going to promote me despite me doing comparable work that was done by senior analysts and managers in our sister group which irked me. I felt my career was stalling after 3.5 years in virtually the same position.

Also during this time, I never forgot my dream of starting my own company. So I tried real estate investing in 2007. Which was like showing up to the California Gold Rush in 1855. I was just a tad late, and it was like trying to catch a falling knife. Towards the end of 2007, I read ""The 4-Hour Workweek"". And I know most of you think this guy is a hack, but he had some gems in the book. I latched onto the idea of creating passive income and began work on niche sites and internet marketing. 3 years later I found myself in debt settlements with credit card companies and I probably sunk some $30,000 into various internet ideas/ventures that didn't pan out.

I got bored with my assignments and left the group and now I'm doing a job in finance I absolutely hate within the same company. But I feel stuck: I'm broke, I don't know what jobs I'm good at or should pursue, and I FAILED at starting my own company or even getting a promotion. On top of that I have no dating life whatsoever. It's been tough to watch everyone I know get married and it seems like my life is passing me by, like every life decision I've made was wrong and that I'm living my worst fears. Its freaking me out. My worst fears were to fail, be alone, and be broke. Check, check, and double check.

I'm studying for the GMAT, there is only one school I'm interested in because of its ties to silicon valley and I would like to attempt or join a tech start-up. I figured this b-school is a good foot in. But I can't help but think what a waste my 20s was/is. I have less a sense of self and direction than I ever did, the things I use to be confident in I'm not, and I don't know what my next move should be. On top of that I'm the heaviest I've ever been in my life. I've made a resolution to eat a slow carb diet this year, but I don't have time to exercise until I take my GMAT in March. But the man boobs and pot belly is not really helping my already shattered confidence. Nor is studying GMAT questions and realizing how tough it's going to be to get a 700+.

**TL,DR**: Lost confidence in myself after college because I picked jobs I wasn't good at; I don't know what jobs I would be good at; I failed at starting two companies; I'm perpetually single; and I'm stuck in a 2nd-tier city in the South.

However, the last 4 or five years running, it's held nothing but pain and misery. Long time ago, met a girl. Loved her. Got married. We realized we shouldn't be together, fought too much. Much better people when we aren't living with each other. Stayed friends. Broke my heart though. Guess that started the misery. But at least we were still friends.

She got murdered by a boyfriend. Can't show our son when I'm crying. Still cry when I think about how I had to tell him. Worst day of my life, by a huge margin. I... couldn't be with her, but I wanted so much better for her. Everything she could have been was just gone in an instant.

Now I'm a single dad, single for years now. Enormous hole inside me. Try to look alive, try to see the bright side, losing hope that there is one. So lonely. Hard to fill that hole with friends when you're limited in how often you can go out. Not that it matters. Everything that helps a little feels like sham, a way to distract myself. Terrible at meeting people. Not scared... just can't figure out what to say to strangers. Dating sites only make me feel worse. No responses. Maybe I'm too ugly. Never thought I was. I'm not getting any younger, but I'm still in my 20s. Maybe it's because I'm a dad? Doesn't matter. I can't have my happiness dependent on someone else. It just seems like the fight would be so much better with someone else there.

I can feel my life... slipping by. It constantly flows past, I'm not getting anywhere. Like when you stand at the beach, and the wave is moving back out. Feels like you're moving until you realize the sand is just flowing past your feet. Not going anywhere at all. In the past, I would have just fled. Move somewhere new. Burn my old life away, build anew somewhere else. Can't do that with my son. He's an anchor. Prevents me from going crazy or extreme, regardless of if those are good or bad.

I feel.. separate from the world. The real me is telling the world me 'go here, do this, react this way'. Inside, I feel helpless, small, alone on the inside. Sometimes I even see myself when I was a kid, inside my current self, controlling it like a robot suit.

I know things can always change. I'm not going to pay anyone to say what I'm saying here. I'm very introspective, I constantly search for why I feel the way I do. I don't need someone else to walk me through it. I'm miserable now because I'm depressed, lonely, and still grieving for someone. Knowing why doesn't make it better. I refuse to delude myself. Can't focus on the what ifs either, that would kill me. A million ways my best friend and ex-wife could still be here. Have to keep reminding myself there are a million ways she could not be here, too. No point playing that game. Just... don't know what I can do. So alone, and disappointed. Every day ""tomorrow could be better"", and then  it's not.

I'm an undergrad.  I just recently made a mistake, and was reprimanded by my professor, but thankfully he did not travel the official route and instead gave me a second chance, and only lowered my grade and gave me no points for a particular assignment.

I plagiarized, plain and simple.  Don't be me, fellow students.  Don't make that mistake.  I'm an idiot for even having the idea in the first place, and an even larger one for attempting it.    I thought that I had disguised the work well enough, but disguised a little too much, and the prof. saw right through it.  I'm actually pretty glad that he did see it, because it gave me the slap in the face that I needed.

It's not even that I couldn't do the assignment and was too shy to ask for help, I was just too lazy to take the time to finish it myself.

If you finish your work yourself, you'll feel better, trust me.  Even if you get a poor score, you know you busted your ass to get it, and that it's all your own.  If you get a fucking D on a project, it's a D you worked for.  If you get an A on some shit you didn't bother to even think about yourself, it's not deserved.

I've learned my lesson, and am going to put forth effort.  I know there will be those who will read this and think, ""No shit, Sherlock.  He's a professor and he's probably seen and dealt with the shit before.""  Well, yeah.  I had that thought too before I did it, but still attempted it like a dumb-ass.

This is more for those that even have the idea to do it.  Don't.  Just do your work, even if your work sucks.  At least it will be your own.

Basically, I am a 22 year old male who has always had social anxieties since I can remember, growing up I was always told that being shy was just part of being a kid and getting into the world, despite the fact that it didn't help repeating a task, something which most people tended to find helped with being shy.

In the past couple of years though its been developing into a very difficult thing to manage, but my brain hits a limit when I am trying to push myself to do something I know I need to do like job hunting and my brain shuts down when it comes to ringing people up, getting out the house and doing social things that the majority of people tell me I should enjoy.

I have been doctors and prescribed medication which I was on for over 6 months and they only served to increase the physical effects on me through the different beta blockers and anti-depressant combinations and they don't seem to have much of an effect at all.

So now I need to dig for knowledge from other people who might know what its like and what things you do that push you past your normal way of thinking, I am hoping that there will be something there that helps me.

**TL;DR** I can't force myself to be social and its wrecking my life, meds don't work. What do you do?

(Crosspost from /r/colbertrally)",13,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/dz85k/reddit_had_lots_of_fun_at_the_rally_but_i_need/,"Before I start, I just want to emphasize that the rally was awesome, and we had a lot of fun. That being said, we had quite a few negative experiences on our way there (and back) and would like to know what we should do now.

So, a bunch of us were super excited about going to the rally, and we reserved seats on the rally bus leaving from Cincinnati. We got to the meet-up spot where we were greeted by our bus ""captain"" Erica. She approached us with a cheerful, excited attitude (although it seemed more forced than genuine, like an airplane stewardess' ""bye bye now!"") and told us that there had been a few changes. Apparently our bus had some sort of mechanical trouble, and we would be getting a different bus which was on its way.

Ok, no real problem yet. Then she told us that the new bus was smaller, and could not seat everyone who had signed up to ride. But, she was hopeful that some people wouldn't show up and we would be fine. ""What if everyone shows up?"" I asked. She said that would mean that she and her husband would have to drive separately. Whoa, I thought, what a nice person, willing to make that kind of a sacrifice for complete strangers.

Well, it turns out, that wasn't exactly how it was going to play out. Several hours later (our bus was over 3 hours late), shortly before the bus arrived, our ""captain"" announced that she would need to see four of the potential passengers in private and called out their names. Needless to say, this was a bit unsettling to the entire group. When they came back, it was announced to us that four people would not be able to go with us to DC, and that if no one wanted to volunteer to stay, these four unlucky people (the last ones to register) would be out of luck. There were a couple of volunteers, but then two people who wanted very much to go with us were forced to stay off the bus. The tone was set for what was to follow.

When we got on the bus, I think it is safe to say we were all pretty disappointed with what we saw. One of our drivers, who were very nice (the real victims in the story actually) announced to us that there are no DVD players, the heat could not be adjusted from inside the bus (only turned on or off), and the restrooms were to be used for ""liquids only."" The seats weren't exactly roomy or comfortable. Some of our travel mates began to grumble and complain, but my friends and I stayed positive, determined to have a good time.

The bus got us to the rally around 12:15, which was technically late, but the real action didn't start till later, so it was cool. The real drama didn't start until afterward when we were supposed to meet up with the bus to leave.

Our frantic ""captain"" told us that the bus was nowhere to be found. It did not appear that she had had as good a time at the rally as most of us. Our group waited in the cold for about an hour, then we went into the Union Station to kill time. When the bus finally showed up, our captain and her husband appeared to be in the middle of a ""discussion"" (I overheard ""because I'm FUCKING TIRED, THAT'S WHY!""). What happened next is not 100% clear, but at some point our ""captain"" and three of her companions stormed off the bus and demanded a rental car provided by the people organizing the buses for them to get back home. Apparently there had been more ""discussion"" with some of our bus-mates and she had decided she could not ride 10+ hours in a bus with us anymore.

As a side note, our poor bus drivers were not provided with lodging, had to sleep in their own bus, had a flat tire while we were at the rally which they had to get replaced during their ""sleep"" time, and the woman chipped her tooth while eating dinner.

So, what I am wondering (and several of the others on our bus had this question as well) is should we contact DC Rally Bus to ask for a full or partial refund? I wouldn't say my experience was ruined by all this, but it certainly did make things a little more stressful, exhausting.

TL;DR Our bus to the rally sucked, was super late, and came with lots of unexpected drama. Should we ask for a full/partial refund?

I really love it here, the campus is gorgeous, it is close to home, and I believe that I will get a quality education. However, it seems that I have run into a problem that is quite uncommon for me. Back at home, I had an extremely tight group of friends, and we were all each other’s best friends. The odd part of this situation was that I am a girl, and all of my best friends were guys. My closest friend, Ian, was even a guy, and we talked and shared advice about everything. Outside of our friend group, we pretty much got along with everyone pretty well. Admittedly, I have always been kind of an outcast. I think I’m like, a pretty average looking girl; I was even in a pretty good relationship with a guy for two years… but for some reason girls are just really offended by my presence. Something about me really turns them off. They just don’t like me. 







Now that I am in college, this innate hatred that girls have for me is really making things hard. I have kind of found a group of guys that I get along with and can become close with, but I know that it won’t be the same. They have really big issues with talking to me about certain stuff, but I realize that it will take a while for this to clear up. I just… I don’t know. I really need a best friend, and I feel so lonely because I have nobody to talk to about my problems. I would talk to my friends back home but they barely have any clue about anything going on here.








Another part of the problem, I think, is that everyone has already cliqued together and become attached. I think I am too late to ever be able to squeeze in. Also, I feel like I am so different than everyone around here. I’m kind of a weirdo, kind of a sarcastic asshole, its just part of who I am… I don’t know.





tl;dr: I’m a freshman in college, and I’m having trouble finding a really close friend because of the cliques here.

Anyway, I was not going to discuss that point today.  I just wanted to point out that my son (8 years) did not want to spend time at her house anymore, so maybe we would have to come up with some sort of arrangment where my other kids could visit her.  My intent was to never be disrespectful or antagonistic.  I went over there with the intention of speaking to her mother to mother.  She has been my mother-in-law for six years and during that time I have never said anything to her directly about her behavior.  I have always let my husband handle issues with her.  I try to be as nice as I can to her when we see her, which is hard for me, because I find her to be a loud know-it-all.  I know that I come off as being terribly fake and insincere at times, because I'm trying so hard to maintain an attitude of respect towards her simply due to her role as my husband's mom and my kids' grandmother.

She says, ""I know you where upset.""

""It's about when Max was here last Friday..."" I said.

She says, ""He's rude and I'm not going to let him talk to me like that when he's at my house.""

I started to get mad when I said, ""But he's a child and you're an adult.""

She says, ""Get the hell out of my house.""

I said, ""I don't expect you to understand, but I expect you to listen.""  I have never said anything of the sort to her before, but geez, enough is enough, and I felt it was time that I confronted her about how awful she can be sometimes. 

Then she lunges at me with her face two inches from mine and said, ""You listen here, little girl.""

I gave her a wtf look, because I'm 32 and she grabs my arms as hard as she can and digs in her acrylic nails.  

I said, ""Are you fucking kidding me?""

I repeat, ""Are you fucking kidding me?""  

We were standing near the patio door and she pushes me in towards the living room.  
I try to leave, but she's still got a hold of me.  We struggle for a few seconds, with me trying to get away and her trying to drag me back into her living room.  I make some progress towards her garage door and I yell for my husband, ""Charlie!""

I yell a couple more times and she grabs my upper arms and screams in my face, ""You don't dicatate to my son!""

I said, ""Your son?  He's my husband!""

I barely make it to the door, pull the handle and scream out the door for my husband again, but she slams the door on my arm and pushes my neck away from the door with her other hand.  

My husband finally shows up at the door, and pushes it open, but she slams it closed on his arm.  Charlie pushes the door open, and she finally relents and says, ""You don't talk to my son that way, you bitch!""

Then she calls me a bitch and a whore a couple more times.  He pushes her back inside and I run out to our van.  

Does this sound as fucked up as I think it does?  I'm in shock and need some perspective.  So, what do I do about this now?   

Edit:  I know I switched tenses a couple times...sorry.  Oh, yeah...I forgot to mention that she weighs 190lbs and I weigh 115lbs. ",,False,,t5_2r367,True,,,True,t3_d70v3,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/d70v3/my_motherinlaw_assaulted_me_today_what_do_i_do_now/,

My life sucks.,16,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/d52rf/tired_of_this_shit_my_life_sucks/,"I am $30,000 in debt from college. I've gone to 4 different colleges, left twice because of money, failed out twice, and never graduated. So I'm paying for a degree I don't have.

I am 28 and have no clue what I want to do that's realistic or practical, or what will make me happy. I remember being 18-19 and thinking I had time to figure it out...and I am no closer to figuring it out now.

It takes all of my willpower to get out of bed and get to work each morning, but I'm able to mostly because of fear of no money &amp; homelessness. I really hate my job, I get a sick feeling every morning just having to go. My parents are dead so I don't really have anyone to fall back on financially.

What the fuck do I do? I just feel so shitty and lost all the time, and I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself. My only comfort comes in the music I listen to during my commute and books I read on the weekend. I daydream a lot about being an artist, maybe a writer or a singer-songwriter, but I haven't done anything creative in a long time, except for writing scraps of bad poetry here and there. I feel like such a useless piece of shit. 

What the hell do I do?

After a night with my friends at the bars last night, I came back to my apartment and decided I should check my mail. I decided this after I emptied all of my pockets (including my keys).

Realizing I was locked out, I called my sister for advice. She said she is a AAA member and gave me the number for a locksmith. So I call the locksmith, they quoted around $90 which seemed reasonable since I never called a locksmith before and it was around 2 or 3AM. Ok, they'll be there in 20 mins.

After the 20 mins, the guy arrived in a plain white car. He didn't seem like he knew too much english but whatever. He looks at my door and says ""oh I thought you were in a big apartment building"" (I have a street apartment). I said ""no... is that a problem?"" and he just touched the handle of the door and said ""it's going to be $250 if you want it done with no damage"". Now I would have argued this price if I wasn't drunk, it wasn't 3AM and I wasn't very sleepy. Instead I said ""ok i need to go to the ATM..."". By the time I got back (5 minutes), he already had the door open and wrote out the invoice which included:

* $30 ""servis call""
* $160 ""open door""
* $50 labor

Now I understand it was late and you can expect to pay more... but not THAT much and I'm pretty sure I got scammed. So Reddit, is there anything I can do to see my $150 again?",,False,,t5_2r367,True,,,True,t3_csob5,http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/csob5/scammed_by_locksmith/,

The day was fine but it seems that she's already really interested in the other guy so I guess I'm just moving on. Thanks everyone for the advice, you guys are really great!

I become instinctively angered by the sheer thought of them. Obviously, today's culture is heavily in favor of alcohol and drugs and I am forced to ostracize myself from many acquaintances because it bothers me so much. I don't like the idea that I have to rely on something to give me the 'peace' and 'entertainment' to enjoy myself. My concern is that, with my very uptight nature, I seem like I'm falling behind in society, like I am the awkward one. Eddie Vedder sums it up perfectly in Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town, ""I changed by not changing."" I'm tired of losing friends and girlfriends because I am the 'boring' one. People change all around me, and I feel like I am stuck in a primitive unprogressive mentality.  I need advice in finding ways I can mentally prepare myself for these things. I want to be able to open my mind and accept these activities, not abhor them as I do now. Any help is appreciated.
