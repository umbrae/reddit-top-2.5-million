An incredibly versatile band from L.A. with songs ranging from hardcore funk to melodic ballads. Currently, they have 10 studio albums.

 * **The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984)**

       This album is probably my least favorite of theirs, but it is definitely worth a listen.  A lot of hardcore funk/punk.

       Top 3 songs: *Baby Appeal*, *Get Up And Jump*, and *Green Heaven*

 * **Freaky Styley (1985)**

       This album is a whole lot better than their first.  But they still haven't found their place in music.  *Very funky.*

       Top 3 songs: *If You Want Me To Stay*, *The Brother's Cup*, and *Yertle The Turtle*

 * **Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987)**

       This album is starting to get less funky and more punk rock-ish.  Definitely a great album though.

       Top 3 songs: *Fight Like A Brave*, *Funky Crime*, and *Subterranean Homesick Blues*

 * **Mother's Milk (1989)**

       This album is where they really start to show their true badassness.  John Frusciante and Chad Smith are now in the band, which makes *Mother's Milk* even more kickass.  In a way, this album is *Uplift Mofo Party Plan*, but on steroids.

       Top 3 songs: *Subway To Venus*, *Knock Me Down*, and *Stone Cold Bush*

 * **Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991)**

       This album is definitely their best album.  Each song is just fucking fantastic.  There is not a single song on this album that I don't absolutely love.  *Definitely listen to this!*  This is where they start to get really diverse.  Lots of funk, ballads, and good old rock n' roll.

       Top 3 songs: *Power Of Equality*, *Funky Monks*, and *My Lovely Man*

 * **One Hot Minute (1995)**

       This album gets a lot of hate from a lot of people for the sole reason that Dave Navarro is on guitar instead of John Frusciante.  Ignore all that bullshit, because *One Hot Minute* is a fantastic album.  One of their best in my opinion.  It is kind of psychedelic, but very funky at the same time.

       Top 3 songs: *Aeroplane*, *Walkabout*, and *Shallow Be Thy Game*

 * **Californication (1999)**

       This album is definitely a step up from *One Hot Minute*.  Frusciante comes back as the guitarist, and it really shows.  This album is pretty funky, but also kind of melancholy at times.

       Top 3 songs: *Around The World*, *Easily*, and *This Velvet Glove*

 * **By The Way (2002)**

       This album is where they start to show their softer side.  Anthony Kiedis's lyrics are better than ever, and John Frusciante's backing vocals are insane.  Can be somewhat funky.

       Top 3 songs: *Dosed*, *Don't Forget Me*, and *Venice Queen*

 * **Stadium Arcadium (2006)**

       This album is definitely their second best right behind *Blood Sugar Sex Magik*.  Everyone knew that John Frusciante was going to leave again after this album, so they decided to make it an incredibly mindblowing double album.  This album showcases pretty much all of their different styles prior to this album.  I would definitely recommend it.

       Top 3 songs: *Wet Sand*, *Animal Bar*, and *Turn It Again*

 * **I'm With You (2011)**

       This album also gets a lot hate from hardcore RHCP fans, but don't be fooled.  The addition of Josh Klinghoffer as the new guitarist really takes the direction of the band in a completely new place. And that place is pure awesomeness.  This album kind of reminds me of *By The Way*, except it is a lot funkier.

For me, starting to listen to and love Bright Eyes was a 6 month ordeal. I would try to listen to an album (usually before bed) and fall asleep before I finished. Yet, when it finally hit me, when I finally listened to the music, the meaning, and understood what it meant, I was hooked, and I want someone else to be able to have that feeling with this band, so lets get started!

* [I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning (2005)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXu2IDaNgfs)

[*I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXu2IDaNgfs) starts off like most other Bright Eyes albums; a 1-2 minute segment with a conversation, or in this case, a story, that progresses into the first song of the album. It definitely takes some getting used to Conor Oberst's shaky voice, but I'll cover that later. This album just recently hit gold, and it is widely considered Bright Eyes' most popular album, (The Rolling Stone considers it one of the best albums of this decade) and there is a reason. It was released at the same time as the less popular *Digital Ash in a Digital Urn*, which is a more electronic-influenced album, where *Morning* is all acoustic, all folk album. 

I'm not going to sugar coat it; it will take multiple listens to get into this album, but it is worth it. It is filled with a good contrast of soft, sad songs like [""Lua""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aZh261KZWI) or [""Poison Oak""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjHACWmO0jQ) and upbeat, happy sounding songs like [""Another Travelin' Song""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvj2OzKnpVM) and [""Road to Joy""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18S8D8kHFlE) (which is a fantastic closing song to this album). Probably the most recognizable song on here is [""First Day of My Life""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwFS69nA-1w).

* [The People's Key (2011)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62hoopKaZRY&amp;list=PL668A49CE2DFBD86E)

Similarly to *I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning*, the People's Key starts off with a 2 and a half minute ""overture"" from Danny Brewer, a 60-something year old new age shaman. The [first song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62hoopKaZRY) of this album (after you get past the intro) is a dark, distorted, post-apocalyptic sounding song. The rest of the album has a similar feel, but it all revolves around a similar theme, one that battles itself over two paradigms that you can use to look at modern life; is technology bad, or good? While technology may dehumanize and categorize us, it also provides us with something unquestionably important; knowledge. This is a recurring theme of all of the songs on this album, especially [""A Machine Spiritual""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA-z3BUHVcw), where the lines 'The People's Key, ringing through arena seats, the black machine played it all from memory' are sung. [""Triple Spiral""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2AHlMLji3k) speaks about religion, history, and modern media (they looted the museum...a casket made of 14 karat gold). [""Beginner's Mind""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AA9i8S87ME) speaks about how culture affects the mind of a child, how we are altered by what we see on the television. It speaks about how we want to change the world from what it is, but when we grow up, we grow cynical about life, and cannot appreciate it as a child can. 

Overall, this album speaks a lot about modern society, and it's definitely one of my all-time favorite albums.

* [Cassadaga (2007)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI7njqSITZk&amp;list=PL4A89567BC8BD3182)

I'm not too familiar with [*Cassadaga*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI7njqSITZk&amp;list=PL4A89567BC8BD3182), as it is an album that I'm still getting into. It seems to fall more into the same type of music as *I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning*, but not quite that folk. It's catchy, engaging, and has plenty of allusions that makes all of Bright Eyes' music fun to try to interpret for yourself.

* [LIFTED or The Story is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground (2002)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHnFbtmiPQU&amp;list=PL1C4F4A2DA787C164)

Like *Cassadaga*, I'm still listening to this album, and I'm just starting to know it well enough to form an opinion on it. I can honestly say that *LIFTED* is my favorite Bright Eyes album yet. It's a good mix of more heavy rock, offbeat rhythm, brass, and orchestrated parts. As of now, [""Method Acting""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIkdr64_cCo&amp;list=PL1C4F4A2DA787C164), [""Lover I Don't Have to Love""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pno9BrK8iI&amp;list=PL1C4F4A2DA787C164), and [""Bowl of Oranges""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmiRWwAXexY&amp;list=PL1C4F4A2DA787C164) are great songs off this album (the latter is a great feelgood song).

Okay, I'm done for now! I haven't had the pleasure to listen of *Fever and Mirrors* or any of Bright Eyes' other work, but I hope that I've interested someone in this band!

Edit: I added 3 albums to the list. I recommend trying them in the order they're listed. Thanks for any feedback!

They really do produce sounds that are relatively unique overall and they're damn good. But anyway, I'm assuming you are already somewhat interested so I won't explain who they are. But if you're not familiar, just listen to a few songs. 

Anyway, most people notice them nowadays because they helped produce some Kid Cudi songs, namely Pursuit of Happiness.

If this sort of style is what you like, you will want to check out their remixes and Beats stuff. There are a lot of rap/hiphop remixes that will let you appreciate their skills.

If you are more looking for electronic music, and especially if you're looking for well produced tunes, see their earlier work. Their self titled album Ratatat and Classics are very good starting points. They both primarily focus on well produced simple melodies that, despite being simple, carry heavy emotion (this seems to be the approach and in my opinion it does a good job). ""Ratatat"" is a little more chill while ""Classics"" is a little louder, but they both cover both ends of the spectrum well. These are my two favorite electronic albums and they were my starting point, so I can't speak highly enough of them.

LP4 might be a good starting point too, but I think it isn't as accessible personally. If you're looking for a more guitar centric sound, this has it. It still sounds very electronic, but the guitar is easier to distinguish from synths and therefore sounds a tad more human like than other albums. It has a lot of simple melodies with a lot of guitar sliding and note bending that is done quite well. 

So there that is, I hope someone checks them out based on this",,False,,t5_2xpnz,False,,,True,t3_1hhfez,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhereDoIStart/comments/1hhfez/wyss_ratatat/,

This guide will provide information on where to start with this amazing band, information on all of their albums, bits and pieces of trivia and different progression paths, etc.


&gt;***What (or who) is Soundgarden?***

Soundgarden is a rock band that started out in 1984, in Seattle. They are considered to be one of the pioneering bands of the musical movement that would later be coined as **grunge**. However, most people agree that Soundgarden frequently crossed over into heavy metal and psychedelic territory and had a less-accesible sound compared to their peers like Nirvana or Pearl Jam.

Soundgarden's current (and longest running, 1991-1997, 2010 - currently) lineup is comprised of : singer/rhythm guitarist [Chris Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cornell), bassist [Ben Shepherd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shepherd), drummer [Matt Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Cameron) and lead guitarist [Kim Thayil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Thayil). 

Former members include bassist [Hiro Yamamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiro_Yamamoto) (1984-1988), bassist [Jason Everman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Everman)  (1988-1990), and drummer [Scott Sundquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Sundquist) (1985-1986).

Interesting trivia : Jason Everman was credited as a second guitarist on Nirvana's [Bleach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_%28album%29), but never actually recorded anything. The reason he was credited is  because he payed $606 to help record Bleach. Soundgarden has recorded only one song with Everman, which is a cover of The Beatles ""Come Together"".

Soundgarden was the first ""grunge"" band to sign a major label (1989's *Louder Than Love*), but not the first to recieve worldwide recognition.


&gt;***""That's great and all, but give me 5 reasons why I should care about Soundgarden""***

You want 5? I can give you 10. 

1. Wide range of different musical elements incorporated into their music.
2. Chris Cornell.
3. Superb songwriting, especially in their later years, the strong point being dark, brooding, moody songs with heavy/philosophical subjects (and indeed, later on, main songwriter Chris Cornell's songwriting would be compared to existential poetry by critics and fellow musicians).
4. Exceptional musicianship (apart from poor Ben Shepherd, every member of the current lineup has been featured in various lists of ""greatest vocalists"" or ""greatest drummers"" or ""greatest guitar players"". That's okay though, Ben is awesome, which you'll soon learn if you decide to go in-depth into SG's music. Really, every member of the band can warrant a reason on why you should listen to SG.
5. The ability to seamlessly blend different genres into one song/album (more on that later).
6. Wide range of technical display, e.g. complicated and unusual time signatures, usage of some very unusual and rare tunings, complex rhythmic parts and really great (and difficult) solos.
7. Wide array of genres : punk-esque rock mixed with Sabbath during their early years; raw, heavily Sabbath inspired metal sound during the *Badmotorfinger* era; psychedelic influences mixed with hard rock/heavy metal during the *Superunknown* era; lighter, softer, more mellodic, but darker sound during the *Down on the Upside* era; more polished alt-rock sound with psychedelic and pop influences during the *King Animal* era (don't take this as a bad thing though, I will explain why).
8. Superb studio work (their release sequence of *Louder than Love* (1989), *Badmotorfinger* (1991), *Superunknown* (1994) is extremely impressive, each album ranking higher and selling more than the last).
9. Some of the best pro-shot live footage available on the internet. Soundgarden is a hit or miss band in a live setting, but most, if not all of their pro-shot footage is superb (*Louder than Live* (1990), *Motorvision* (1992), *MTV Live and Loud* (1996), *Live on Letterman* (2012) and *Live from the Artist's Den : Live at the Wiltern* (2013).
10. Chris motherfucking Cornell. [Seriously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gA5MYU85Ow).

&gt;***""Gee, that sounds great, I want to know more about these highly acclaimed albums of theirs""***

Fret not, potential Knight.

First up, we have [***""Screaming Life/Fopp""***](http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/images/fopp.jpg), released in 1990. Not actually an album, but rather a compilation of their two previous EPs, *Screaming Life* (1987) and *Fopp* (1988). This is ""album"" contains their very first single, *Hunted Down* and its B-side, *Nothing to Say*, which are said to best represent the budding Seattle scene and its raw, developing sound. However, the rest of these songs are nothing special, so this record would not be the best place to start your Soundgarden journey, unless you're very much into raw, dirty punk rock inspired music with a local twist).

Next up, we have the true first album, [***""Ultramega OK""***](https://lh3.ggpht.com/-bMfM5ST1Buk/US9qFFss4nI/AAAAAAAAEUE/z3e-yBZKNgs/s1600/Front.jpg), released in 1988. This album demonstrates their early, raw, dirty punk-rock driven sound while incorporating Black Sabbath influences. Contains 13 songs, including a humorous ""cover"" of John Lennon's ""2 Minutes of Silence"", with Yoko's part cut out, entitled ""One Minute of Silence"". This, along with tracks ""665"" and ""667"" (which make fun of the presumed Satanic content in rock music), show a light-hearted side of the band. 

The album was recieved well, so much so that it got nominated for ""Best Metal Performance"" in 1990 at the Grammys. **Not the best album to start your journey, but good if you're more into the raw, punk-rock esque ""indie"" sound.**

[***""Louder Than Love""***](http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/68144490/Louder+Than+Love+Soundgarden.png), released in 1989. This is Soundgarden's major label debut, however it did not sell all that well. The sound of this album is much more polished, the songs are reminiscent of classic heavy metal, mixed with stoner rock. The band experiments with unusual time signatures and increasingly complex rhythmic structures (however, this is not their most technicaly advanced release). The album contains 12 tracks, including a hilarious take on hair metal, called ""Big Dumb Sex"". Singles include : *Loud Love* and *Hands All Over*. The album recieved favorable reviews.

Overall, a step in the right direction for most metal fans, this album stands as a gateway : from a dirty, punk driven sound into a more polished, heavier, sludgier sound. **Not my first choice of start, but this is a good album to start with if you're into the heavier, Sabbath inspired music.**

[***""Badmotorfinger""***](http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/Soundgarden%20-%20Badmotorfinger.jpg), released in 1991. This, along with Nirvana's ""Nevermind"", Pearl Jam's ""Ten"" and Alice in Chains' ""Dirt"", helped catapult alternative rock into the mainstream. Although not their bestseller yet, this album was what made Soundgarden known to a worldwide audience (and for good reason).

The sound of this album is probably the heaviest Soundgarden has ever been, with clear heavy metal influences. However, while containing the some of the heaviest songs the band has ever recorded, the improvement songwriting and musicianship on this album is really what sets it above the other albums. After *Louder Than Love* was released, founding bassist Hiro Yamamoto left the band. Before starting to record *Badmotorfinger*, the band welcomed Ben Shepherd into their ranks, who quickly became the band's other most prominent songwriter after Cornell. Shepherd introduced new, fresh ideas to the band and the result was a heavy, daring, yet smart piece of music that was able to whitstand the test of time.

The album contains complex rhythm parts, unusual guitar tunings (one of the very songs in existance to use the [""Ostrich tuning""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich_tuning), where all the strings on a guitar are tuned to the same note, is on this album, by the name of *Mind Riot*), unusual time signatures and experimentation with sounds.  The album has 12 songs and contains some of the most well known alt-rock songs of the 90s, including *Rusty Cage* and *Jesus Christ Pose*.

 One thing I **HAVE** to mention : If you're into heavier music, listen to [Black Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K913KVe3kH8), an outtake from Badmotorfinger that was re-recorded and finished in 2010.

Reception of this album was stellar and it sold well. It was also nominated for a Grammy for ""Best Metal Performance"" in 1992. **A good album to start your Soundgarden journey if you're into heavier music that also has experimentation and great songwriting thrown into the mix**.

That said, it might be helpful to have an overview of the high points. I'll divide his output into three main groupings:

**1) The 70s Singer-Songwriter Jazz/Beat Phase:**

Best album to start with: Blue Valentines

And then: The Heart of Saturday Night


**2) The 80s Darker, Stranger, Kurt-Weill-esque Phase:**



Best album to start with: Rain Dogs

And then: Swordfishtrombones

And then: Frank's Wild Years


**3) The 90s and Beyond Phase of Experimentation with Various Styles**

Best album to start with: The Mule Variations


And then: Alice 

And then: Orphans

A lot of folks might disagree with my decision to recommend *TOYPaJ* over *EotS*, but the reason I want to do so is this: I am a huge fan of bands that can create a real sense of tension in their music.  Keep in mind, I definitely don't mean to say that I'm not capable of enjoying their early records, which were pretty unabashedly by-the-numbers CA punk.  It's just, yes, *EotS* totally redefined the band.  However, it did so merely by upping the production &amp; streamlining the accessibility [read ""poppiness""] of the music.  The songwriting was altogether unchanged, &amp; there is no tension in the music.  It is a very easily digestible record.

By the time the band hit *TOYPaJ*, though, things were beginning to change.  This record was released less than a year after Box Car Racer's s/t record, which showcased Tom experimenting with ideas that weren't in line with Blink 182's well established &amp; honed sound.  You don't need to look further than ""Everytime I Look for You"" &amp; ""Shut Up,"" on TOYPaJ to see what I mean.  The bridges to those two songs are unlike anything they had done previous, &amp; are more in line with Box Car Racer's material, &amp; the material Blink 182 would be producing for *Untitled*.

1372619370.0,8,self.WhereDoIStart,1hdmyi,[WYSS] John Frusciante,8,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhereDoIStart/comments/1hdmyi/wyss_john_frusciante/,"Although John Frusciante is most well known for his work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers (and they have an excellent page going on [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhereDoIStart/comments/1hcpf0/wdis_red_hot_chili_peppers/)), but over the years he has released an extensive body of solo work.

The problem is that John Frusciante can be off-putting to someone who simply picks an album at random and begins listening, and that person never gets the joys of appreciating this unique artist.

I think the hands-down best way to begin listening to Frusciante's solo work is to begin with the album ""Shadows Collide With People"" (*Note, for those listening to this music online. I haven't exactly tracked down why this is, but there are usually at least two versions of each song on this album, almost as though they are abridged/unabridged versions. The tracks on Spotify and most other music services follow this pattern, but the tracks on Youtube are generally unabridged. This is most pronunced on the track ""In Relief"", and the track for this song on the album should in no way be taken as the definitive version*). Two factors play large into this: Production level and album themes/goals.

SCWP is to date Frusciante's most heavily produced and mastered album. While this is often times not a relevant factor (most music simply should be produced and mastered ""enough""), with Frusicante you could be listening to nothing more than an analog recording of an improvisation which hasn't ever happened again. The full power of the studio and musical technology is behind him on this album, and it shows, because the album is a work of beauty. 

Tying into that is the thematic direction of the album. Although some artists attempt to cultivate an essential sound and distill this from each successive album, Frusciante takes the opposite tact and explores new sounds and themes with each album (making it hard to know ahead of time what anything will be like!). Part of the reason that any random album could be off-putting is that Frusciante isn't afraid to try things out of the norm. ""Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt"", for example, heavily utilized screechs and abrupt screaming, and vocal pitches were specifically not precisely in tune with the rest of the music. At the opposite end of the spectrum is SCWP. The album was scrupulously recorded, re-recorded, re-mastered, and adjusted, so that each point would be pitch-perfect and fit as perfectly with the rest of the music as possible. NLaUJaT is important and beautiful in its own stark way, but SCWP is the golden child-- not only a taste to be appreciated, but a taste that doesn't need to be acquired.

The song which first caught my attention on this album, which I think is an appropriate introduction, is ""Song to Sing When I'm Lonely"". One important aspect of this song is the use of the synthesizer to open the introduction and complement the rest of the song. As well as being extremely pleasing to hear, it gives an indication of the layers and diversity which are to come on the other tracks. Some listeners who are able to catch the lyrics on the first try will note that this is certainly a track of vocal sadness hidden by an upbeat and hopeful-sounding musical core.

""Second Walk"", on the other hand, is a song that has to hide no sadness in its joy. It's pure exaltation at breaking free of fear from death, fear of living with fame, and being anything other than the true self. The lyrics of the first half are tailored almost exclusively to Frusciante's experiences in these regards, starting originally when he joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The second half, though, is more generalized, with the last verse ""Be who you are-- Do what you do--
Not win or lose"". Throughout it all, though, it embodies a vibrancy and renewal that are perfectly captured by the title ""Second Walk"".

""Carvel"" and ""Cut Out"" are, in my opinion, two of the best tracks on the album as a whole. They're somewhat slower and more serious than the previously-mentioned tracks, and represent what seems to be the gravity of Frusciante's deeper thoughts and considerations.

""00 Ghost 27"" is a fascinating departure from the rest of the album in that it is entirely electronic, features no vocals, and paces extremely slowly. It's a piece that's difficult to understand, and the closest I can come to understanding is to say that I *think* the track is supposed to evoke a lot of reaction, a lot of feeling that isn't informed by lyrics or other clues. Nevertheless (or perhaps because of this!), it's a powerful and moving addition. It's interesting to note that the other numerical track on this album ""Failure 33 Object"" evokes none of that same kind of reaction. It's also electronic, without vocals, and changes only slowly. However, the particular sound palette evokes more a feeling of curiosity, exploration, possibly even voyages into space and other unknowns.

""In Relief"" (*specifically the mastered version which can be found on Youtube, not the stripped-down album version*) is a personal anthem meant to inspire each person. However, the lyrics are such that Frusciante avoids falling into cheesy bland unoriginality. The warm blanket of the introductory instrumental measures, combined with this message, conveys the comfort and strength that it's meant to inspire. ""When your leader's gone, he means to make you strong. He never went away, cause what you need, you are."" The use of layering is more constant in the vocals than in other tracks, which is a point I personally love, as John harmonizing with John in two or more parts is an ideal sound.

That's a start! Every single song on this album blows my mind. From here, it's probably best to move onto ""To Record Only Water For Ten Days"". While SCWP is the beginning, TROWFTD is the bridge to Frusicante's older works. Some sounds will be off-putting, and there will be tracks you dislike. However, I find that even tracks which contain *elements* I dislike often have other elements which are extremely pleasing.

This album can also be a jumping point by which to move into newer albums. Between SCWP and TROWFTD, which have significant similarities, there will be a new core of John Frusciante's sound which is applicable to his newer works (such as ""The Empyrean""), even if his older albums don't appeal to your taste.",,False,,t5_2xpnz,False,,,True,t3_1hdmyi,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhereDoIStart/comments/1hdmyi/wyss_john_frusciante/,

Suggest songs based off of the examples I listed below, not the title. Actual grunge/blues rock sounds quite different. Sorry for the mix up.


To give you an idea of the kind of music I'm looking for, I'll list a few songs:

Do I Wanna Know - Arctic Monkeys

R U Mine - Arctic Monkeys

Consoler of the Lonely - The Raconteurs

Icky Thump - The White Stripes

The Denial Twist - The White Stripes


I'm just looking for rock that is focused on catchy (but heavier/distorted) guitar riffs, simple drum beats and bearable vocals. I'm kind of getting into stoner metal which is sort of what I'm looking for, however the vocals are too heavy and they don't really appeal to me.

List a few artists with your favourite album of theirs and I'll give it a listen on Google Play Music.

Is Mud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=953PkxFNiko)). If you're just now getting into Primus, it's a good idea to check out their latest, Green Naugahyde ([Lee Van Cleef](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz8zICEafk8)). It came out in 2011, their first since 2002.

----------

As for Claypool, he has a ton of side project groups. They usually include saxophone, marimba and sitar and are less metal-oriented than Primus.

His first solo album, Of Whales and Woe, is fucking greeeeeat. I'll give you two.

[Phantom Patriot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MlBoXCZtsM)

[One Better](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NJZre-2QBE)

----------

The Frog Brigade's Purple Onion album is fantastic. [Ding Dang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaWOC5IXNxc)

----------

Then there's Oysterhead, which is Claypool, Trey Anastasio of Phish on guitar, and drummer Stewart Copeland from The Police. [Little Faces](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPWBKLRsdtY)

----------

That's just to start! There's lots more in there when you start digging, The Fancy Band, Holy Mackerel, and a group including Buckethead :D

Here's a primer for what sounds and textures to expect. He is most commonly known as a rusted gravel-voiced man who sings pirate-jazz but there are many sides to him.

**Early period:** Music of this time consists of a blended range of folk/country ballads, slow blues, vaudevillian, and jazz. The settings are generally seedy bar rooms, all-night diners, and street corners with characters who are either just trying to get by or struggling to get up. Life is depicted as it is and Waits is often drinking it all away. The mood is dark, somber, and lonely. It's always late at night. 

* **Closing Time** 1973 - Most who know Waits wouldn't even recognize him on this cut. Smoking had not yet destroyed his voice so it sounds very clean here. This album mostly consists of folk piano ballads but does venture into light jazz. This isn't as dark and somber as his later stuff but it ain't happy either. Though Tom has a full band on some tracks, the album is pretty stripped down and unplugged throughout. This is his most accessible record. If you want to get into Tom but are put off by his voice or weird stuff, this is a great starting point.

* **The Heart of Saturday Night** 1974 - Waits voice is still clean here and his music has picked more speed and texture. There is much more jazz and blues in this record. This one is mainly about getting the most out of a night out on the town (finding 'the heart of Saturday night') The ballads are still there but they are less folky. The other tracks are moderately upbeat. If you like well written lyrics, this one will suit you. Also very accessible.

* **Nighthawks at the Diner** 1975 - Live one-take recording in front of a small studio audience. Half of this record consists of  charismatic banter that is almost as musical as the songs themselves. Waits is very charismatic and shows skill as a comedian and actor. This one is very jazz oriented. Waits employs a drummer, upright bassist, and a sax player. His voice is a bit raspier here. Not as accessible as some may be put off by his character acting.

* **Small Change** 1976 - The first thing you will notice is that Tom's voice has been destroyed. Fortunately, he knows how to use this to his advantage. It really sells the characters he creates on this album: drunkards, low-lifes, seedy salesmen; he even takes on the point-of-view of a hooker on one track. He also injects film noir into the setting with spoken word-like pieces like 'The One That Got Away' or the title track. There's more of the upbeat jazz seen in the former album but it's noticeably darker in content and sound. For the depressing ballads he has employed orchestral strings. Come here after *Blue Valentine*.

* **Foreign Affairs** 1977 - This one is ""like an old B&amp;W film"" as Tom said of it. More film noir elements here. This one won't make a great starting point. Better to listen to *Blue Valentine* or *Small Change* which are in the same vein (and better executed to me). More strings here and also a vaudevillian style duet with Bette Midler (yeah...) I'm a bit biased on this one so maybe a commenter will have a better description of this.

* **Blue Valentine** 1978 - A slight departure in sound. No strings with the exeception of the first track (A rendition of *Somewhere* from *West Side Story*) this features electric guitar for the first time. Much more blues oriented with a touch of jazz. A good one to listen to if you want to get used to Tom's gravel voice. Come here after *Nighthawks*.

* **Heartattack and Vine** 1980 - This album marks a transitionary period and another change in sound. Tom is now rougher and more ragged. This one is half blues-rock scorchers (heartattack) and soft ballads (vine). Strings return for the ballads and Tom has added a brass section. This record has a bit more texture than the previous albums. I think this one is for the fans who understand Waits.  Not a good starting point.

**Middle period:** This era is marked by a complete change in everything people came to know Waits by. Tom stopped drinking and smoking and married a woman who introduced him to Captain Beefheart. The music here is very unique and stylistically different from his previous work. gone are the piano and string orchestras and barroom jazz. He now opts for obscure instrumentation and a more abstract songwriting approach. 

The next three albums are considered a trilogy:

* **Swordfishtrombones** 1983, **Rain Dogs** 1985, **Frank's Wild Years** 1987 - Twisted polka pirate jazz delta blues experimental backwater gospel lounge lizard parlor funeral industrial music. These albums are where the popular image of Tom Waits comes from. There is a lot of sonic texture here. Waits uses a range of instruments from maribas to banjos to desk drawers. *Rain Dogs* is widely considered to be Waits' masterpiece. I would start there then go to *Swordfishtrombones*. *Franks Wild Years* is a musical ""soundtrack"" with Waits playing the character of a wannabe big time Hollywood dreamer. It's easily the least accessible of the three but that isn't saying much.

* **BIG TIME** 1988 - A live album mostly consisting of material from the last 3 albums. He hams it up 'big time' here. 

* **Bone Machine** 1992 - Another change in sound. Waits darkest album. It's almost scary with themes of suicide and murder. The music actually sounds like the title. This album is 'all stripped down' and low-fi. Very percussion-heavy and blues-rock oriented. Industrial. This one is kinda standalone. 

**Late period:** Tom is older, wiser, and dustier. He's much more political, lyrically. Some of it critiques current events. The only one you should really concern yourself with is *Mule Variations*. The rest of them are better after you've heard the starters I mentioned.

* **Mule Variations** 1999 - A great place to start for his late stuff. Actually this is a good starting point period. This album is dusty, rusty, and abandoned in sound if that makes any sense... seriously, it sounds like it was recorded in a barn in the middle of nowhere's middle of nowhere. Some good gospel here but mainly genreless.

Note: ""This list is incomplete. You can help by expanding it"". That's all I'm going to cover for now. It's late and I spent too much time on this already. If anyone has other recommendations or insight on certain albums (like foreign affairs or his later stuff), post em' and I might add them to the primer.

I recommend starting with [Steady Rolling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AWCRkcCKm8) which is one of their more catchy songs, and then moving to [My Madonna](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1RETCMDoPY), [The Deader](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3n1qXH6FP0), and [Nothing to You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVOcFme-ZUQ) to get more of their compelling lyrics.

The Throes is their first album and my favorite, followed closely by their self-titled album released in 2007. Lately their sound has evolved quite a bit and they are exploring different parts of their range.

Now RXB got their start during the Third Wave Ska movement of the 90s and they fine-tuned each release into a really original sound. Their latest album could be described as a kind of progressive-experimental-punk. The beauty of RXB is that you have these two completely different styles on each end and you get everything in between.
A good starting point for this band would either be *The Resignation* or *...And the Battle Begun*. But if you're into more ska-like stuff I would start at *Halfway Between Here and There*.
One thing I've noticed about this band is that it really is music for musicians. Of all the people I've showed this band to, those that play and experiment with instruments got the most enjoyment out of this band.

I'll have to say, looking at their album list, Emotionalism is by far my favorite with their best songs on it, like Paranoia in Bb Major, and The Ballad of Love and Hate.

**Early**

* Please Please Me (1963)
* With the Beatles (1963)
* A Hard Day's Night (1964)
* Beatles for Sale (1964)
* Help! (1965)

**Middle**

* Rubber Soul (1965)
* Revolver (1966)
* Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)

**Late**

* The Beatles (1968)
* Abbey Road (1969)
* Yellow Submarine (side one) (1969)
* Let It Be (1970)





First off, the **Early** stuff is generally more poppy, more rock n roll influenced, including a bunch of covers.

The **Middle** stuff is where The Beatles start to come into their own and carving out a real niche sound for themselves; this is where the basis for the Britpop fashion of the mid 1990s, including Oasis and the ilk.

The **Late** stuff is where they become more experimental, trying out many different techniques and trying to be as inventive as possible.

So, it depends what sound you want, but from the eras:

**Early**

I would start with A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale

**Middle**

Rubber Soul

**Late**

Abbey Road

Decide which era is for you and expand.

This is my advices on where to start with the great Miles Davis. His discrography is so large, he embraced so many differents genres and styles that it's always quite difficult to pick you first album(s).

So there ya go:  
**1.** *Kind of Blue* / *Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet* / *Ascenseur pour l'échafaud*  
Theses are great albums to start with. It's the ""classic sound of Miles Davis"". It's not his first works as well, so you already get a lot of professionalism and a grasp of hist personnal style.

**2.** *Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet* / *'Round Midnight* / *Birth of the cool*  
Some of the less ""classic"" album. It already features some more abstract figures, that you'll understand better if it's not your first album.

**3.** And then, there are a *lot* of things you can listen to, which, although they are a lot more abstract, are very influential and powerful shit.
Electric/Modern music: *In a Silent Way*, *Bitches Brew*, *Tutu*...  
Modal and Post-Bop: *Miles Smiles*, *Milestones*...
Third Stream: *Sketches of Spain""...  

And then there's JUST SO MUCH you'll be able to appreciate!
Have fun, bitches!

a really dynamic and creative electrojamrock band that covers so many styles 
first things first... archive.org is your friend, in fact its quite possibly the best music website ever made. every taped live show ends up on there. great source of unlimited free music from a variety of bands.
I'm going to be really brash here and say if a bands worth listening to, there's a copy of their live show for free somewhere. most likely on archive. let's be real here you don't hear live recordings of most of the bands on the radio because quite frankly, most of them can't play for shit live.
onto the matter at hand....
album wise if you want to hear the evolution of their sound listen to em all!
WARNING
AVOID PLANET ANTHEM AND ASSOCIATED EPS LIKE THE PLAGUE. THEY ARE THE BASTERDCHILD OF TOO MUCH CHEESESTEAKS POOR HEALTH DECISONS, AND AN ATTEMPT TO BE CREATIVE. FAILS MISERABLY and takes away from the true GENIUs and talent of the band

excuse me for my behavior.  this isn't nam there are rules here. and they clearly state music suggestions. 
soooo.... go to archive and search a couple good dates such as 5/1/99, 12-31-99,5-21-99;
search haymaker 10-04-02 and 10-05-02
as for newer more electronic sounds 2-15-09, 4-17-09,4-18-09,4-20-09,,

2 - Circuital
3 - Evil Urges
4 - Z

The albums are all so good IMO that it's hard to go wrong with any of them.  It Still Moves is such a great album - every song is fantastic in its own right.  Slow to fast, easy listening to amazing guitar riffs, I feel this album is what created their signature sound (a mix of country/folk/rock/R&amp;B/melody/amazing voice).  The other three albums I have listed are VERY hard to judge, they are all so good in their own respect.  If you listen to their albums chronologically you can definitely hear the band evolve, and it is a positive evolution into Circuital.  If you don't listen to songs in their entirety you will miss some beautiful melodies.  

If you want to see them in concert, they are without a doubt the best act I've ever been to.  I've been to NUMEROUS genre and bands all throughout the spectrum for many many years and MMJ is simply electric.  They have such a profound appreciation for the sounds their audience loves - they played the better part of two and a half hours last summer and hit nearly every single amazing song I wanted to hear.  

Also if you like MMJ and havent checked out Jim James solo album Regions of Light and Sound of God it is also an excellent album, although much more mellow and in a different category than MMJ.

To someone new and wanting to check out more I'd reccomend listening to the following songs in the following order:
Can't hold us
Same love
Hold your head up
Vippassana
Victory lap
10 000 hours
The magic
Otherside
Falling
Im free 
As soon as i wake up 
Bboy
Wake up
And then my favourite The end

Some of his songs are really deap and some motivational and some just about his life or the world.In rap lyrics, thats really the only topics that are rapped about but the way he does it is... Beautiful in a sense.Macklrmore was the first artist to ever make me feel music and he scalled my body with the chills and for that i thank him.if anyone cares the first song i heard from him was the town.

My all time fav verse will always be the last verse of my oh my. It transcends the limits of baseball and touches upon the awesomness of memories and som much

Thanks if you read the whole thing, any comments on your fav mack song below.Lets discuss!",,False,,t5_2xpnz,False,,,True,t3_1hd3lq,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhereDoIStart/comments/1hd3lq/wdisim_gonna_pop_some_tags/,

Lights Out - 1977 - Their sixth and best overall studio Album

Strangers in the Night - 1979 - Live Album from the ""Lights Out"" tour
   - One of the great live albums of all time.

Walk on Water - 1995 - The ""classic"" lineup reunites and proves they still have it.

From there UFO has much left to explore with over 20 albums released.",,False,,t5_2xpnz,1372598127.0,,,True,t3_1hd2wb,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhereDoIStart/comments/1hd2wb/wdis_ufo/,
