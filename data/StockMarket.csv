Welcome to Reddits front page to the stock market!

This was an abandoned subreddit until earlier this year when I took it over. There was no activity and hardly any subscribers, but I felt the need for a more active stock market reddit (I mod r/investing), so I started posting here.

We are starting to see a lot more activity and contributions from traders every day!

What can you do to help?

We all follow our own little universe of stocks and financial sites. If you see something informative or potentially market moving, post it here! It is impossible for any one person to cover everything, so the more eyeballs we have out there, the better for everybody!

Browse over CNBC, Bloomberg, thestreet.com, optionmonster.com, find something interesting and share!

Do you have a question about a stock or a trade idea? Post it! 

Want to get a chart up or even draw some pretty lines on it? Some very easy sites you can do that with, try tradingview.com or freestockcharts.com. You can easily take a snap shot and insert it into your post.

While my personal trading style is rather technical heavy, yours does not have to be, in fact I encourage different methods as much as possible, it allows us to compare notes and help each other out.

Do not be intimidated if you feel your level of knowledge if below others, we all had to start somewhere! In fact, I will give karma to the dumbest question of the day!

Looking forward to reading your posts!

 *  you guys can chime in and see the trades live and ask questions
 *  makes it much easier for me, as i dont have to timestamp everything.

You can find a link the IRC channel on the side bar on the right hand side, or [click here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23reddit-stockmarket). 



**Registering**

If you're not familiar with IRC, you can post questions here and jcao will answer them. You will first need to register on the channel. [Here](http://www.deepspace.org/nickserv.htm) are some commands that will help you get setup.  



**Purpose**

The purpose for this channel is to discuss daily trading ideas/news throughout trading hours. All general questions/thoughts should be posted on /r/stockmarket. To be clear, we don't want this channel to turn into /r/investing ""Hey, I'm new to investing, what does shorting a stock mean?"". Not to down play /r/investing, but the channel should only be used for trading ideas and news only.

Also, Jcao is working on a marketbot thats pretty impressive. If you see him testing out his code on the channel, feel free to ignore. 



**Moderators**

Jcao and I will be moderating the channel. We will be on 99% of the time. The moderators of /r/stockmarket will also have admin control.



If anyone has any questions or suggestions, feel free to post. This channel is still a major work in progress, so all input is appreciated.

EDIT: 

Update in:

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) said it lost about $2 billion tied to synthetic credit securities after positions taken by its chief investment office were riskier than expected.

“This portfolio has proven to be riskier, more volatile and less effective as an economic hedge than the firm previously believed,” the New York-based company said today in a quarterly securities filing. JPMorgan declined 5.5 percent to $38.50 in extended trading at 4:51 p.m. in New York.

I'm looking for advice on a career move, and was wondering if anyone here had any additional information or experience with my situation. I submit to this subreddit quite frequently, but for some strange reason I find the need for a throwaway account. Below is a background about my situation.


So, all through college I was really interested in the markets. Involved with a bunch of investment clubs, extremely passionate about technical/fundamental analysis, really thought I knew what I wanted to do when I graduated. I ended up getting an internship in IB, and moved full time after I graduated. During that time, my technical skills probably doubled. The broker I was paired with was extremely helpful and resourceful, taught me a lot. A lot of my friends went to prop shops after college, but I was too scared. 20k starting salary while living in New York, while the rest of your salary is in commission scared the hell out of me.


3 months after working full time, I get laid off. This was around 2008-2009. I was pretty upset, but wasn't devastated. I was fresh out of college, pretty young, plus unemployment was sweet. I started looking for other jobs in the finance field, but was told to try different things. A lot of suggestions were to try a smaller company to get the experience. Try a different field, you're young you never know what you might like. Job offers come flying in (surprisingly) and I decided to try something different. I accepted a job at a Financial Analyst position at a Pharma firm. It was awful. Experience was really good, but I missed the markets terribly. I start trading while I work. It started off slow, but then i became pretty active. I decided a couple weeks ago I wanted to get back into the financial markets field and started applying.


So far, I've been on 2 interviews, and have a couple coming up. The ones I am particularly interested in are from prop shops I applied to. I had offers from a bunch of scam prop shops, basically 100% commission positions where you have to pay for their training course. There are a few where I can't find reviews on, Infinium, WTS, and Spot Trading. Does anyone here have any insight on those 3 companies? Can anyone offer any advice on trading desks in general? I'm still actively applying, but I really don't want to waste my time if I know the position isn't right for me.


Thanks in advance.

Stock: MHH - Mastech Holdings.  They [just announced](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastech-holdings-inc-announces-2-221500346.html) a $2 per share dividend on 12/21 payable to shareholders of record on 12/20.

I've read a little and had a few conversations with friends about how the share price will likely decrease by the amount of the dividend after the dividend is paid.  I don't know how accurate this is.

If I take, say, $10,000 and with half, take a Long position (to be a holder of record to get the dividend) with a stop loss at -5%, I should benefit from the dividend, lessened by the amount of the stop-loss delta.

If I take the other half and short the stock at it's current price, with the expectation that it will drop in-line with the dividend amount, I will gain from that change also, to the point I can select at will, until I pull the trigger (with a stop loss at +5% maybe, just in case).

Example: 

* $5,000 / 6.90 (current price) = 724 shares x $2.00 dividend = $1,448 pre-tax and fees gain.

* 724 shares drop to $6.56 per share, subtracting ~$250 from the gain.  New Gain: ~$1148.

* Short 724 hares @ 6.90; hold until price drops by $1.50 = $1,086 pre-tax and fee gain.

* Total gain on investment = ~$2,284.

Does that sound reasonable and feasible?

Bloomberg - S&amp;P 500 Posts Biggest First-Quarter Gain Since 1998
 By Rita Nazareth - Mar 30, 2012 1:49 PM GMT-0700

U.S. stocks rose, extending the biggest first-quarter advance since 1998 for the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index, as stronger-than-forecast growth in consumer sentiment and spending bolstered optimism in the economy.

Halliburton Co. (HAL) and Dow Chemical Co. advanced more than 1.2 percent to pace gains in commodity producers. Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the largest U.S. entertainment company by market value, climbed 1.8 percent after Lazard Ltd. raised its recommendation for the shares. Apple Inc. (AAPL), which has surged 48 percent in the first three months of 2012, retreated 1.7 percent today.

The S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.4 percent to 1,408.47 at 4 p.m. New York time, extending its quarterly rally to 12 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 66.22 points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,212.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.1 percent to 3,091.57. The measure still posted the biggest first-quarter gain since 1991 (CCMP), surging 19 percent. The Russell 2000 Index of small companies declined 0.2 percent to 830.30 today.

“There’s no reason to avoid equities just because they’ve gone up a lot,” said David Kelly, who helps oversee about $394 billion as chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. “People are less fearful of a global financial meltdown emanating from Europe. If you look at valuations and the potential for economic growth, those things tell me the market should have room to move higher over the next few years.”",,False,self,t5_2qjuv,False,,,True,t3_rlluo,http://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/rlluo/rstockmarket_and_the_stock_market_close_with_a/,

Anyone want to take a look at airline rates and think people are going to travel? Doesn't hurt Priceline though. Tickets that were $250 are now $50, Priceline soars.

Fucking Facebook is on a tear. Lulu, CMG, all the greatest hits are at least 2% gainers for no apparent reason other than, ""THE ECONOMY SUCKS, MORE STIMULUS""

Apple announces they are going to give their shitty employees at Apple stores a raise and the stock soars. I thought paying employees more is supposed to tank a stock because it means less profit. OH YEAH I FORGOT, everyone will work at an Apple store and buy Apple shit, ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SOLVED!!!!

We will never have a correction because the Fed will just step in and buy stocks, causing all the momo traders to buy so they don't miss an uptick rally. I'm having fun looking at all the parabolic 2 day charts. It's like praising the picture the neighbors retard gives you.

DAMMIT! I MISSED $5 TO THE UPSIDE OF FACEBOOK, I GOTTA BUY IT NOW SO I DON'T MISS THE RALLY!!!!

That is the only fundamental left in the market. Not missing a rally. Doesn't matter if it's bullshit. At least oil didn't go to $90 today, doesn't matter because gas is still selling for the same price as it was when oil was $105.

Either the insiders already know QE3 is going to be $2 trillion or they are really, really, stupid. I still don't get why stocks would take off before the money is handed out. Wouldn't you want to profit more off the free cash? Driving stocks up just makes it more expensive to buy more shares with Benny Bux.""

I'm an option trader. My strategy trades individual companies as well as indices. For the companies, I generally do not place trades when there are earnings within my trade window, and try to stay away from companies when there are mergers or other big news events.

I'm looking for a site (paid or free) that can give a relatively uptodate and quick summary of the company and its news. I use yahoo and google news but they have so much crap to weed through on the big companies, but its slightly better than looking at the wire.

My wife suggested some kind of news-cloud that highlights the big ""items"" being talked about, but I can't find any site that does this.

Does anyone know of a place where I can get a quick run down of the big happenings for a company? ",,False,self,t5_2qjuv,False,,,True,t3_14k48u,http://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/14k48u/quick_news_overview/,

1337189346.0,7,self.StockMarket,tq88o,Technical chart: AAPL $530-$540 target?,9,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/tq88o/technical_chart_aapl_530540_target/,"TL/DR - I think the $530-$540 range starts to bring buyers back.

Long version:

The big push in AAPL began in Jan when the stock gapped up $25 to the $450 range and took off from there. We call that a gap n go.

Since that was the launching point, I wanted to see the Fib levels from that point to the highs.

The 50% or halfway market between these levels is $540. 

Next I did some Elliott wave voodoo, assuming the bull stance on this would mean that this correction off the highs here is an ABC correction, if so then A=C (which is all neat and nice when that happens), that would put it around $532.
 

We also have a support  declining support level coming in around the same range.

This is what the technical analysts at the big firms will be showing their bosses. Whether they decide to act on this kind of stuff, we do not know, but in the $530-$540 range AAPL is $100 cheaper than the highs, which again, is a nice round number that might attract buyers.

1369590609.0,6,self.StockMarket,1f39n0,Help me analyze what happened with this options trade?,6,0,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f39n0/help_me_analyze_what_happened_with_this_options/,"I'm fairly new to options trading, but I've done my reading and understand at least the basic concepts involved.  I've been steadily losing money paper trading options due to one stupid mistake or another (and learning along the way).  

On Friday, May 24th, I correctly predicted a small intraday movement downwards in IBM, and bought Put contracts hoping to profit from the move.  However, even though the stock moved down as I expected, the value of my Put contracts actually went down instead of up!  Instead of taking a 4% profit, I took a 4% loss.  Here's the trades I made:

Buy 27 Jun 2013 200-strike Puts, filled for $1.61 (or $161 per 100 shares) at 12:33pm (IBM was $205.79 at the time, and the contract spread was $0.03)

Sell 27 Jun 2013 200-strike Puts, filled for $1.56 at 3:24pm (IBM was $205.51 at the time, and the spread was still $0.03)

Between the time I bought and sold, the implied volatility stayed roughly the same (changed from 16.7 to about 16.3, as reported by my trading platform), and the delta also remained the same (-27).

I've been trying to figure out how the Put could have moved down 8% lower than I was expecting.  Surely the time decay couldn't account for that steep of a drop in a mere three hours?  

Doing the math, here's what I expected:

(205.79 - 205.51) * 0.27 = 0.0756 expected gain in Put price


0.0756 + 1.61 = 1.68 expected value of contracts at sell time


(1.68 / 1.61) - 1 = 4.69% expected gain in Put price

What happened instead is that I had to sell for $1.56, which makes no sense to me.  Here's the [IBM chart with relevant parts shown](http://i.imgur.com/auEgWJx.png).

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — LinkedIn Corp. may have spooked investors on Friday with a disappointing outlook, but Wall Street remained relatively positive on the professional social network, with many brokers raising their estimates for the company.

Several also pumped up their price targets on the stock — which had soared more than 60% over the last three months until LinkedIn reported first-quarter results on Thursday afternoon. Many analysts paint the lower forecast as a hiccup due to a change in the company’s marketing services business and management conservatism.

LinkedIn  shares were down 9% at $183.34 in early trades on Friday. The stock had set a new all-time high — crossing the $200 mark — on Thursday prior to its first-quarter report.

To summarize the Feuerstein-Ratain results, they found that 21 of the 21 analyzed low-cap oncology biotechs lost share price after publishing phase III results.  21 of the 27 big-cap oncology bios did ok after phase III results.

Markets rallied at the end of the day to hold the lower bound of the weak up channel, but APPL earnings miss after hours will probably mean a test of the 200 DMA and/or support at the 1315-1320 range tomorrow.

http://i.imgur.com/4flZb.png

PPO and RSI show how little conviction has been behind the current rally, 3rd time RSI has crossed 50.  The market has been rallying in the face of a stronger dollar, but the long term correlation is negative.

The number of S&amp;P 500 stocks above their 50 day moving average turned sharply down over the last 3 days, and a retest of the 50% level seems likely tomorrow.

In relative strength, retail is holding support, but the more broad consumer discretionary has been in a clear relative weakness trend since the beginning of June.

Seeing significant divergence between S&amp;P 500 and several indicators, such as the Consumer Retail / Consumer Staples Relative Strength Indicator.  This indicates a defensive positioning by the market:

http://i.imgur.com/aTVb0.png

As well as divergence with the US Govt 10 Year Bond Yield:

http://i.imgur.com/mrM3G.png

This would lead me to believe a compression will take place in the near future, and that the current price of the S&amp;P 500 is inflated by bets that QE3 or additional liquidity operations will be announced by the Fed at the Aug 1 meeting.

If anyone finds this useful I could probably post these with commentary a couple times a week.  To learn more:

Facebook Inc., the world’s largest social-networking service, is aiming to file for its initial public offering as early as next week, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

The company is discussing a valuation of $75 billion to $100 billion, said two people, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven’t been made public. Timing for the filing is still being discussed and may change, they said.

The IPO would provide funds to help Facebook maintain its expansion and fend off competition from Internet rivals such as Google Inc. (GOOG) and Twitter Inc. The company has discussed raising $10 billion in the offering, a person familiar with the matter said in November. Facebook may set its price at the low end of the valuation range to entice investors and ensure the stock rises after the IPO, said Anupam Palit, an analyst at GreenCrest Capital Management LLC in New York.

1373579928.0,5,self.StockMarket,1i4113,Crude oil: is the party over?,5,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1i4113/crude_oil_is_the_party_over/,"For those who have been watching the price of crude oil tread ever higher, wishing they got in when the party was just starting, I think it's time to consider joining the party on the short-side.  In fact I took up such a position this morning.

But it's important to criticize one's own conclusions.  So here are my arguments why my trade is *wrong*

1. Oil broke into a new high territory a few days ago and there are no real resistance levels below $110.

2. The US Dollar's strength is starting to wane thanks to the Bernanke's jaw-boning.

3. Gold is making a technical bounce, and when that happens it can pull the other commodities along with it.

Offsetting those facts, here's my bear case:

1. There are two gaps waiting to be filled, one from yesterday and on from last week.  If you believe in that kind of thing, that should return the price of crude down to ~$103 then ~$101.

2. Contrary to popular opinion, the chaos in Egypt really doesn't have doodly-squat to do with oil. Some people were afraid that the Suez canal might be closed, creating supply problems.  What a fantasy; that will never happen in a million years.

3. Caught up in the fever, the market has been ignoring bearish news like [this](http://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/crude-oil-comes-off-16-month-high-after-bearish-iea-report-250152): [T]he IEA said that oil supplies from countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will rise by 1.3 million barrels a day in 2014, an annual growth rate that *""has only been achieved once in the last twenty years.""*

4. The inevitable downturn of the US equities market will no doubt revise 2014 consumption forecasts lower.

So, not sure how this will play out, but for better or worse I'm short crude. I do feel like I'm placing myself in front of a freight train, so wish me luck!

EDIT: formatting

EDIT2 (July 12): Ugh, I made almost 1% yesterday and that's been totally wiped away today, and then some, as crude blows through 106. I still like my trade though; don't want to be shaken out too easily. Waiting to see if there's a retest of the high.

EDIT3 (July 16): Sideways action before the Fed meeting tomorrow.  http://www.troll.me/images2/i-would-be-so-happy/if-crude-could-retest-10430-i-would-be-so-happy.jpg

Some risks/concerns are that the price will drop after the dividend is awarded. I have never read of anyone doing this before but I'm sure I'm not the only one who has thought of this. 

The biggest barrier to entry is building enough capital to reduce commission costs. I'll give a report on how it goes in March.

My uncle told me to invest in Ford because somebody told him to. At this point I have no idea where to put my money and I have no idea what kind of research I should be doing on companies.

Second:

http://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/x0u3e/stem_update_officially_up_more_than_100/

-------------------------------------

And now the latest update.

So we had the typical sell off after the good news of the first CIRM award of $20MM.   This sell off was helped by a well timed downgrade by Roth Capital which drove the pps down to less than 1.45.   I knew that Roth was not a real analyst.  In fact Roth was the last financier to STEM and this downgrade indicated to me that their services were no longer required.  In other words Roth exercised all their warrants and sold all their shares and knew STEM had more good news coming in September and wanted in on that too.  They most likely went to STEM asking for another discounted offering and STEM said no.  This looked bad from a PR perspective but since I knew what Roth was trying to do(lower the pps to buy more cheap shares) I immediately started buying shares in the range of 1.45 - 1.63 .  So while my original average of .90 was raised I was also adding more shares to the pot.  My final average ended at 1.30 when Maxim started coverage on STEM as a BUY and a target of 2.60.  Maxim is just a bigger and more respected Roth so I expect them to be doing business in the future.  As to when I'm not sure.  Hopefully they don't need them.   Maxim's coverage popped the pps and saved it from further decline which worked out good for me because I was out of cash. :)  Finally STEM announced they would hold a CC on the upcoming spinal cord results which drove the pps up in a frenzy.  I sold 1/4 of all my holdings which is considerable.  Mostly the shares I bought in the Roth downgrade event cycle.  @ 2.16 this past Friday.  I did this to hedge against possible bad news on Monday when the spinal cord results came out.  

Well it wasn't bad news: http://www.nasdaq.com/article/stemcells-inc-reports-positive-interim-data-from-spinal-cord-injury-trial-20120903-00062

The important part being:

""We are very intrigued to see that two of the three patients have gained considerable sensory function. The gains in sensation have evolved in a progressive pattern below the level of injury and are unanticipated in spinal cord injury patients with this severity of injury, suggesting that the neural stem cells are having a beneficial clinical effect. Sensory function of all these patients was stable before transplantation, so the reappearance of sensation is rather unexpected.""    


STEM is holding a CC tomorrow at 11:30 AM EDT to talk about this.  I encourage anyone interested to call in and ask questions.

Wednesday is the CIRM vote for another $20MM award for Alzheimer's.  The agenda can be found here: http://www.cirm.ca.gov/Agenda_2012-09-05/icocgoverning-board

The RFA we are interested in is: RFA 10-05.   So if you are listening to the call, pay very close attention to that.


Now back to trading.   So traders are fickle.  They tend to buy the story and sell the reality.  So we'll have to see how the market takes the spinal result news Tuesday in pre-market to judge it.  If it dips significantly I will step in and buy since we still have the CIRM award Wednesday which has an unknown outcome although I give it a high probability of success.  This is one reason I freed up some cash Friday.  

The key here is that STEM continues to bring in great trial results in high profile diseases while continuing to bring in non-dilutive cash via CIRM.  The last part is the most important.  Stem cell companies burn huge amounts of cash.  They usually raise money through very dilutive offerings through the likes of Roth Capital.  If that dilution does not occur you can expect big returns since this science is so exciting.  So right now by my calcs, STEM does not need to dilute at all this year if they get that award Wednesday.  Later in the year they are up for 2 more partnership awards from CIRM.   If they land all of these they won't need to dilute all of next year either!    The implication to shareholders is large.   Now having said that STEM can still dilute if they want and GERN did it all the time even though they did not need the cash.   So we'll have to be careful and take some profits but at the same time don't give up the farm of massive returns if STEM does not dilute.  I'll be constantly trading this one and will likely always hold a core position.  GL to those interested.


**Update:**

Well the party is about over.  The sub committee at CIRM did not recommend the $20MM  Alzheimers award.  So I doubt it will win an award Thursday.  They can over rule the review committee but it doesn't sound like it in this case.   I sold all my tarding shares I bought from 1.45 to 1.60 today and now have left just my core shares averaged in at .97.   I will most likely let these shares roll the dice unless I see a golden opportunity to sell tomorrow which I doubt.  I hope it goes up but the event stream is ending in the short term.

There are 2 more partnership awards at the end of the year but that's a ways off and in the meantime a no vote by CIRM only increases the chance of dilution.  Hope I'm wrong on that. 

Signing out.


**Final Update **

Sold all my shares.   Made a huge profit trading this but without that award coming there is a strong possibility they could dilute so I'd rather take my large profits now and maybe get back in after dilution if it occurs.   May even short it a bit heh.

Good luck to anyone still in.


**Update 3**

In case anyone was wondering I'm now buying CBRX.

http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/financialHighlights?symbol=C.N

I see 9 quarters of positive EPS's, and an expected positive EPS announcement on Monday of ~$0.88.  When an EPS of $0.31 was announced last December, the stock was trading at a low of 24.82, just $.36 down from where it is now.  

Further down the page, I see a price to book ratio of 0.42.  I am reading this to mean the price of 1 share of stock is 42/100 of what the physical book value of the company is.  Compare it to these companies:

http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/financialHighlights?symbol=JPM.N

http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/financialHighlights?symbol=HD.N

http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/financialHighlights?symbol=LOW.N

http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/financialHighlights?symbol=WDC.O

JPM has a ratio of .73, HD 4.40, LOW 2.08 and WDC of 1.11.  By comparison here, C seems way low on this ratio.

Beta for C is high at 2.5, which explains why it has dropped so quickly compared to the rest of the market, but also means it should explode when the market moves the other direction.

Current PE for C is 7, and the 5 year high PE ratio for C is closer to 55.  The PE ratio is currently at a 5 year low.  We're also nearing the 52 week low for the stock in general.

From a TA standpoint, I'm still holding out hope for a bull flag to make its run on Monday through Wednesday.  I also see C sitting on its support line:

http://www.finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=c&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d

So, give me a reason I shouldn't average way down on this guy.  What am I missing?  The only downside I can see is that the beta coorelation to the market is very high, and the S&amp;P seems to be falling hard with a possible target back below 1300.  I just have a very hard time believing it can get back to its June 4th low with no major bankruptcy announcements from Europe as were being expected back on this date.

**Edit:**  Just picked up another 150 shares at 25.33.  Wish me luck.

March 9 (Reuters) - A heavy burst of bearish option action in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc in the hours before Starbucks announced plans to launch a single-cup coffee and espresso brewer has raised eyebrows among some option market participants.

Option bets on a big move up in Starbucks shares and on a sharp drop in Green Mountain stock preceded the news.

""The level of aggressiveness that traders early on Thursday came for Green Mountain March downside puts was very suspicious,"" said Alan Thompson, options market maker at Timber Hill, a division of Interactive Brokers Group. ""It raised our eyebrows.""

The put buying in Green Mountain ""was off the charts into last night's announcement,"" said Jon Najarian, a co-founder of online brokerage TradeMonster in Chicago, who also noticed very strong buying of upside calls in Starbucks on Wednesday.",,False,self,t5_2qjuv,False,,,True,t3_qqdm8,http://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qqdm8/big_volume_in_gmcr_puts_before_the_sbux_news/,

Rule number 1.  the market is always right.  Smart money waits for the news to be digested by the market and lets Mr. Market tell them what it thinks before taking a position, retail gets in early on anticipation of the news event thinking it will go one way or another way *while in reality, retail has no way of knowing which way it will go until it goes and will be at the mercy of whatever Mr. Market decides*

Key example 1:  Greece ""default"".  We all knew it was coming, it was structured in a good way and the market has blown through most resistance levels on the chart and is probably going for high of the year, the market reacted to the issue last fall, and then shrugged it off, and has gone higher ever since. 

Key example 2:  Simple chart to determine when to get in after the news, where to put stops.  Here is GMCR chart from yesterday:

http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=GMCR&amp;p=5&amp;b=6&amp;g=0&amp;id=p48992316031&amp;a=260499568

See on the chart, how we opened at low and retraced to high before staying somewhere between all day?  That sets the high and low as resistance ad support, market has not yet made up it's mind which way it wants to go yet, when it breaks one of those lines, that is most likely which way it will go.  Wait for the break of one of those lines, and then trade in direction of break, with stop at break.


Disclosure:  I took my first long term hold position of the year on the recovery of the pullback from last week, I anticipate the market is not done going higher yet due to the hard and fast recovery, if I am wrong, I am wrong and the market was right, I have stops set at the lows of the pullback just in case.

Not so long ago, the mere sight of riots in Greece had us selling off as if the world was ending, now [Athens burns](http://rt.com/news/athens-burn-clashes-riots-145/) and we rally to new highs.

James K was a Global Strategist for a major financial instution, here is a piece he wrote on Seeking Alpha:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/376361-greek-default-and-devaluation-would-it-even-matter

Snippets:

&gt;the total value of Greek commerce in goods and services in the EU amounts to less than 1% of annual EU GDP. Besides, Greece exports nothing of critical importance to the EU that cannot be easily be substituted by other suppliers.

&gt;Another example of the importance of Greece to the EU: Simply writing off 100% of the Greek sovereign and private debt held by European public and private institutions would cost about 3% of total European Union (EU) GDP.

So while he goes on to explain this in depth, he does end off with something I agree with:

If one's a swing trader or market timer, me thinks one has to pay attention to things like this.

So now what? The mirror opposite. All 30 Dow stocks were down today and the same for the top 20 NDX stocks. I follow 50 stocks at all times that I call my ""nifty-fifty"" stocks and that list is signaling bounce time (or at least alerting that a bounce can come any minute). Personally, I'd prefer a couple more days down on the Nasdaq Comp, not necessarily as hard as today's drop, but two more because four consecutive days down (or more) very often mark a significant swing bottom. Haven't had a four-day decline in the Naz this year, even three days down in a row has been hard to come by...so tomorrow...probably bounce time.

The price is just under 225 from a close today of 196. Yesterday I decided to purchase an out-of-the-money May 195/205 bull call spread in order to speculate on Amazon beating on earnings. I paid $4.10 for this spread. To offset some of this cost, I sold a May 165 put for $.97.

165 is support and 195/205 is the 38.2%/50% retracement levels from Oct high to Dec low. I could have chosen a much higher spread like the 205/215 but I wasn't sure how much Amazon was forecasted to move. Normally I like to look at the IV but I didn't have time this time around. In fact, the 205/215 would have probably been a better choice because I would have risked less and probably made more.

Total cash outlay including commissions was $320. If Amazon went below 195 after earnings, I would most likely lose all of the $4.10 i paid for the spread. If Amazon went below 165, I would probably have to purchase AMZN at 165 but be paid $.97 to due so.

Tomorrow I will close the spread out with a nice gain... the 195/205 spread now worth close to $1000. And also Buy to Close the put for a near 100% gain.

From an earlier article and analysis on GRPN before it went public:
&gt; The products may be subject to federal laws including the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act), which may affect their stated expiration date, for example. (Maybe that’s why the company sends out e-mails reminding you to use your Groupons.) The company also has encountered unexpected state regulations, such as a notification from the state of Massachusetts that some restaurant discounts in that state might violate liquor laws. The company also mentioned potential regulation in Europe, which has laws governing “electronic money institutions.”

http://i.imgur.com/KTygl.gif

Back in Oct we saw one of the strongest reversal rallies in years. If you remember, we were all freaking out about riots in Greece and how the dominoes would start to fall as soon as Greece defaults.

That was Oct 4th, the day the panic was at its highest. We had a huge reversal in trend that day and the market soared 200 points over the next 3 weeks. 

Using the high and low of that powerful rally, I extended some fib levels outward and as you can see they cleanly set the support and resistance levels on the most recent high and sell off.

I liked this set up and I got some bear ETFs like SDS and FAZ in hopes that this was a more permanent resistance level up at 1374. Right now it looks like we may push above it, which to me, indicates an attempt at the 1400 level, which makes my SDS very sad. :P

1400 is interesting. Not only is it a psychological level (think Dow 13,000 and what a stink CNBC makes about it, S&amp;P 1400 is more important because the S&amp;P has 500 stocks in it, not 30 like the Dow), but its also the next fibonacci level.

Also pay attention to that rising wedge since Oct, the apex is nearing. Bears really do not have much to go on here except for a potential break below the wedge or below 1340, which ever comes first. That is the line in the sand for any technical trader.

Europe IS worse, its just a matter of time before this hits China and there magical month over month GDP growth.

--------------

China’s economic expansion would be cut almost in half if Europe’s debt crisis worsens, a scenario that would warrant “significant” fiscal stimulus from the nation’s government, the International Monetary Fund said.

Based on the IMF’s “downside” forecast for the global economy, China’s growth could drop by as much as 4 percentage points from the fund’s current projection, which is for 8.2 percent this year, the organization said in a report released today by its China office in Beijing.

The outlook expands on the IMF’s warning last month that the world could plunge into another recession if Europe’s woes deepen. Premier Wen Jiabao reiterated last week his government will “fine-tune” policies to support growth amid the region’s debt crisis and the cooling domestic property market.

But I once heard that when a market-maker gets a order for a put that they can't fill, they sell a call and/or buy the underlying stock (or something similar) to cover the put they wrote. 

What this could mean is that when investors get scared and buy puts to hedge, they could actually be pushing the stock price higher. 

This time around, VIX is lower than ever so it is very cheap to hedge. If the above is true then it would be a while before people get actually complacent, and it freefalls.

It seems to me that one should be able to do that by doing a convolution of the 1-day change distribution with a ""modulation transfer function"".

One should be able to determine the shape of the MTF by deconvolving the n-day distribution against the 1-day distribution.

Has anyone here tried that? 

I once knew how to do that shit. I even published a paper apx. 45 years ago deriving the transfer function of a vascular bed by analyzing what happened to a dye pulse passing through it. But I haven't thought about that stuff since! And I have no idea where the paper is!  :-(

As I remember, it involved dividing Fourier Transforms.

I'm still a beginner here, but I wanted to contribute.  Any constructive criticism of my post or idea is welcome.

[TTWO ](http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ATTWO)

Reasons:
1.They under performed over the last 2 quarters, driving their stock down over 50% since Feb, and lowered their guidance for 2013, and are now in the high $7.8x range from $15 previously, making this an ideal entry point if they move anywhere close to their former glory via these two forthcoming games.

2.  Borderlands 2 looks like it is going to be a pretty big, preorders already placing it above some high-profile games like Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne 3, LA Noire, Bioshock, and Civilization V.   Borderlands 2 is due out on Sept 18th, 45 days from now.

3.  The much-anticipated Bioshock: Infinite is due out this Christmas as well.  The Bioshock game has some large boots to fill, but from initial videos and commentary, it sounds like it might hit the spot. 


What do you guys think?  Buy before $8, ride the Borderlands 2 profit, stay on for the hype and buildup for Bioshock, and then sell off?  Others have mentioned a target of $17 but I don't want to get ahead of myself.  Anything over $10 would be gravy.
