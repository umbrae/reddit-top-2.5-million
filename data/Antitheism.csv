I assure you I am.

Why, I agree with all of the Nazi teachings.

Hitler is Führer.

Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten.

But not all Nazis fit into your catergory of ""bad"".

Most of us are good people.

I mean, you don't need to take *everything* Hitler says literally.

Obviously, it's bad to kill Jews.

Nobody in their right mind would kill someone simply because they were a Jew.

That part of Führer's speeches are metaphorical.

In fact, Hitler doesn't condone killing.

Ever.

Death is more of a metaphor on politics.

You wouldn't understand, you're not a Nazi.

Communists aren't that bad either.

I know Hitler says we should kill communists.

But you can still be a Nazi and disagree with some of what Hitler says.

I have a confession.

I've never actually read Mein Kampf or heard Hitler speak.

I get the gist of it though;

Aryan supremacy is important because Mein Kampf says it is.

Mein Kampf is right because Aryan supremacy is important.

Honestly, what don't you understand?

Besides, why not just join the Nazi party?

You don't lose anything.

If you don't want to kill Jews, you don't have to.

All you need to do is accept Adolf Hitler as Führer.

Nothing else really counts.

Where do you get off judging all Nazis by a few bad ones?

We're not all extremists.

Most of us are really tolerant.

But I assure you, I am a Nazi.

It's really rude to say I'm not one because I like Jews.

It's generalizing, racist, and it makes the good ones of us feel bad.

Besides, at least we can agree hat gypsies are bad.

What, so you want more gypsies on Earth?

You owe your life to the Nazi Party.

Look at the state of our government. Look at the state of our country.

How could you attribute that to anyone *but* Führer?

Not all Nazis are the same.

I'm a good person.

You don't need to take all the teachings literally.

The holocaust wasn't really *caused* by Nazis.

The people in World War Two just happened to be Nazis.

Besides, who are you to determine what makes a person a Nazi?

Ideas change over time, and so does the definition of Nazi.

I personally choose to be a Nazi, and though you don't think I'm a real one, I am.

So, World Ice Theory is hard to understand.

I get that. 

Personally, I believe in World Ice Theory.

But there *is* a lot of evidence for relativity...

Perhaps I believe in both.

After all, they really don't clash.

And this theory is as good as yours.

When it all boils down, I have the right to be a Nazi.

It's protected by my rights.

You can't tell me what to believe.

My opinion is just as valid as yours.

Just to clarify, there are many different types of Nazis.

And you can't judge us all based on a few.

Just look at me;

Am I not moral? 

Am I not good?

I am a Nazi.

I assure you I am.

You just wouldn't understand.

You're not a Nazi.

You poor brown eyed soul.

Please forgive my rant.,160,25,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/qywjc/tonight_i_went_from_atheist_to_antitheist_please/,"I was having dinner with my parents and brother, and somehow we got on the topic of the old catholic church we went to back when we were in school. I brought up the hilarious part of confirmation class where the teacher tried to tell the class that the communion was LITERALLY the body of christ and the wine was LITERALLY his blood. I questioned her. I said the crackers were made from flour, and the wine from grapes. They were only figuratively his blood and body. The teacher told me I was wrong. She insisted they were literally the blood and body of jesus. Needless to say, I called her bs on that and several other things, and stopped going to church. My parents were furious, and grounded me until I went to church again. After three months of being grounded, they realized I was serious, and was never going back. I was very religious before that, not that it means anything. Parents can make a child believe anything.

My brother and I had a good laugh about it, my parents did not. My dad attempted to make a point that there was no way I could know or prove that it was not literally the blood and body of christ, because they have faith that it is. I couldn't fucking believe it. My mom joined in on his side. It pained me so much to hear my intelligent father, and loving mother spewing such insane nonsense. They are very religious, and completely eat up every ounce of bullshit their church feeds them. AND IT FUCKING KILLS ME TO WATCH. How can people be so deeply brainwashed that they can ignore factual evidence. Not just to do their own research, but to just throw it out. Fuck that.

Why do we hold any reverence for these people? Shouldn't they be institutionalized? They claim to speak to things that aren't there. They claim the things talk back. THEY CLAIM THE THING DOES THINGS FOR THEM. THEY CLAIM THE THING CONTROLS EVERYTHING. They base ALL OF THIS off a fictional book that dates to the beginning of recorded history. Can't we round these people up? If you substituted any other word for ""god"" or ""jesus"" in the shit religious people say they would be sent to insane asylums immediately. Why is religion so much different?

Religion is a fucking cancer on the human race. Scratch that, it's worse than cancer. If I had the choice to rid the world of one, it would be religion, hands down. Religion is leaving the majority of the population in a never ending state of retardation. And yes, LITERALLY retarded. Because I know the goddamn definition of literally. And I know what I've seen from religion. It's fucking disgusting. I hope to live long enough to witness the fall of religion. I will dance on the rubble of every church, and cry tears of joy, for the next step of human evolution will be upon us.

1354829647.0,75,self.Antitheism,14elxa,I was asked if I thought the DNA evidence and human genome disproved the Bible by a Christian friend. This was my response:,90,15,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/14elxa/i_was_asked_if_i_thought_the_dna_evidence_and/,"To answer your question from the other day more directly, I would like to say:
Genetics has proven the Adam and Eve story to be purely a myth. Without the Adam and Eve story there is no 'Original Sin.' Without 'Original Sin' there is no need for 'Salvation.' Without a need for 'Salvation' there is no need for 'Jesus.' Without 'Jesus' there is no Christianity.

The whole of the religion is built on a story that did not happen. All the evidence contradicts it --100% of the genetics, fossils, cosmology, etc.
This particular narrative, like all other religious myths, is full of good things --placed there by their human creators. But there is no denying, given the evidence, that it is a human construct. It is prone to corruptibility and flaws. But it has a key feature. It satisfies our need to understand the world around us --it provides us with a narrative-- it yields a sense of purpose.

But a more realistic approach is to be scientific, not to abandon reason in the face of refuting evidence. If you get rid of religion, all the same questions are still there: What is my responsibility to my fellow man? How should I live my life? What is the best way to build a society? And the quintessential question: How can I determine the answer to these things?

The religious answer is always one of divine revelation --dictation-- fascism. The scientific answer is always one of reason. It may mean that you have to approximate the result before all the information is in --before there is a sufficient amount of evidence collected. But I'd rather be partially right and open to better explanations than to purport a failed hypothesis --one that is demonstrably false.

Ethics is something like this. The ethics of the Old Testament are horrible. The ethics of the New Testament are much better. This is not a testament to our 'creator' or to his divine 'grace,' but to our own ingenuity and growth. However, to say that even this is a perfect system is ridiculous. We can do better --and we should not accept what we are given just because of the 'authority' of the source, if it does not conform to reason and withstand evidence. For example, the views on women and homosexuals are lacking merit. 

So in my personal opinion, this is the religious endgame. While it is true that I cannot disprove the existence of some undefined, arbitrary deity, I can demonstrate things that are contradictory and would refute the existence of 'particular' deities. Jesus Christ for example is easy to refute with actual evidence (not biblical myths about what the historical figure supposedly said or did). Jehovah is even easier --he does not possess an absolute moral code but the claims are that he does.

So where does this leave us? Well, it leaves those who care about the answers to the questions we are still left with only one way to reach those answers. Second, it frees us up to focus solely on those things and not on some imagined order and some imagined will of some imagined dictator. Last, it leaves us with a responsibility to our fellow man --and in light of the potential and actual horrors of religion --its stifling effect on the use of reason and the accepting of truth, not to mention all the heinous crimes it permits and in many cases commands... it is of dire importance that we combat it.

* Wastefulness. When I say that, I mean, ""The opposite of thrift."" He denied people entrance into heaven simply because they wouldn't abandon their possessions on the spot. Would it be moral for me to tell a single mother that she'd be happier if she quit her job and lived in poverty? Would it be moral for me to convince everyone that the only way to get into heaven is to live without foresight or planning? No, I'd be considered an asshole.

* Thought Control.

No one has full control over their thoughts, but, hey, here's Jesus, and he says that you sinned when you had that one thought that one time. Thought censorship is ridiculous and Jesus is a douche for saying it.

What traits does he have on the good side? Be nice to each other. Wow, what a revolutionary concept. Don't you think society figured that out by themselves? Didn't they have to to get to have a society in the first place?

Basically you are allowed to criticize any ideology or person you feel like, but for some reason yet to reveal itself religion sits on a mighty pillar and must always be respected, not just accepted. To get an A (or the swedish counterpart) in the obligatory subject of world religions, one criteria is literally to ""show respect for all religions and religious people"".

On another subject, we all know how Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions. Once again I'm not certain how this is handled elsewhere, but if a child (&lt; 18) in Sweden is in need of one the parents have no say in the matter. This is of course the only sane thing to do, but it also means you don't acknowledge the possibility of Jehovah's Witnesses actually being right. If there was the slightest chance that giving them blood somehow doomed them, it would not be such an easy decision. 

The conclusion is that a lot of people think they respect other religions because they fit what they already think is right. Which is NOT the same as respecting the belief itself, because when the opinions truly differ, the other side doesn't really get a say at all. That's just not daring to deal with it.

Imagine it, being forced to have sex with some strange man and being treated as property, being violated again and again, this horrible feeling that keeps recurring, all given the okay by your parents who believe that there is an all-powerful, just creator and ruler of the universe who explicitly said that this is fine.

Imagine you've never made any usable amount of money in your life. You starve, you are sick, and you have no idea how long you'll keep living. Each moment you live is pain, emotional and physical. Imagine you're told you deserve that because you, in a past life you don't even have any recollection of, did something bad.

Imagine strange people arrive in your city, not to exchange goods, not to visit, but to kill your own people, and everything your people accomplished, because they didn't worship this different god the strange people had.

Imagine growing up and discovering that you are falling in love with someone of the same sex. Imagine that you get sexually excited at their body the same way a heterosexual person would at the body of someone of the opposite sex. Imagine that everyone around you feels that this kind of thing is a sickness, something wrong, something that shouldn't happen, the likes of pedophilia and murder, and you have to hide it. Imagine that the greatest feeling you have for another human being must remain secret because you can't even fathom the horrible things that will happen if you let it out.

Imagine thousands of people's still-beating hearts ripped out as blood sacrifice to the gods that people believe will die without enough human blood to sustain them. Thousands of daughters, sons, mothers, fathers, with every amazing moment that could happen later in their lives taken away in moments of ritualistic agony.

God was never a part of my life, I never believed in magic, I just didn't care.  I was able to think, so I thought.  

As I got older, I started to actually learn what religious people believe, I started to learn about the bible, and about persecution, about hate, and fear.  And after that, I decided that what I was, was an atheist.

Then I got a little bit older, and rights were being taken away.  People are hurt, shit on, beaten down, have their livelihood and happiness taken away from them, because ancient beliefs said that was the thing to do.

Right now its gays.  What about back when it was blacks?  When black/white marriages were illegal?  How is it that so many ignorant people just don't see the connection?  That we, as a race, are on the cusp of a scientific era that even I would call miraculous.  And Catholic hospitals won't give out birth control, because it's against their belief system?  They receive federal funding, yet will not comply with federal law?  There are so many loopholes, exceptions, so much slack given to religious institutions, because of a built in fear of offending someone, because in the back of their minds, weak-minded people are afraid of magic.

My father raised me with the attitude of simply ""There is no God.""  Now, he thinks ""well, maybe I'm wrong"".  He's afraid to die, he's afraid of what will happen to him.  Nothing.  His brain will cease to fire impulses, and he will never exist again.  As will I.  As will all of us.  There is no magical plain we deserve as we die, there is no reward.  Those who embrace religion, see a reward.  They see their life, the people they love, their family, and friends, as just a test.  To see if they deserve heaven.  They cheapen the world around them, while hurting strangers, solely on religious grounds.

After that, I wasn't an atheist.  I see the relative merits that religion has had in the past, I see that Christianity, Catholocism, Judaism, Vodoun, Grecian, Roman, all had something to offer a primitive society.  But now, in the year 2012, we are better.  We are smarter.  We don't need to guess why crops grow, or where the sun goes at night.  We have answers, we have science.  I am now an anti-theist.  Religion hurts people.  The rules it forces on innocent people are harmful, and for nothing.  There is no God, there is no heaven, there is no reward.  And I have grown to detest those who choose to live in ignorance, instead of embracing the truly wonderful world of facts.

This community should no longer be stagnant.  People think atheists are mean, and hurtful, but many don't know there's such a thing as being actively AGAINST religion.  So please, don't let such an important idea fall into oblivion.

He had a lot of anxiety issues and reached a point where he couldn't deal anymore. We tried as best we could to support him, but in the end he took his own life in a fit of depression. I won't go into details, but suffice to say it was very brutal, and the worst experience of my life. 

He did not have much family, and no one immediate to him, so it was left to us to deal with the aftermath. It has been a rough week and while our friends and family have been supportive that hasn't always been the case.

On several occasions people we care about, and don't want to hurt have made some pretty offensive religious comments in their attempts to be helpful. An example of this was being told, ""This was God's will to teach you a lesson you needed to learn."" 

Now, I don't know about you, but when I heard this I almost completely lost my shit. What kind of person thinks that my roommates life was worth so little that it could just be tossed aside to teach me something? Not only that, but what the hell am I supposed to learn from that?

This is just one of the many poorly worded,  unthoughtful, religious comments people have made since this happened. I know they were trying to make me feel better, and they had good intentions. I don't want to tell them off, because I don't feel that would be the right thing. Emotions are high right now, and I am not willing to make rash choices. 

How do I let them know that I don't want to hear any more without burning bridges and ostracizing the people I care about?

EDIT: Thank you all for your kind words. I have spent many hours debating how to deal with this situation. I know that it is not my place to dictate to others what they should or should not believe. Just like I feel it should not be a religious persons place to push their beliefs on me. I try to be understanding when I can, but my tolerance for religion is very low. I cannot support any belief that fosters discrimination and sells fear. For now I have decided to take the high road and let it go. It is not worth fighting about. After all they are only words. 

I don't disagree with any of you. Your points are all valid and things I have thought myself. Sometimes you just need to hear it from someone else to solidify it in your mind. Thank you all for helping me. We may be strangers to each other, but we share the common bond of the human condition. Wherever you are I hope you are well. 


EDIT #2: This has brought up an interesting conversation. One thing I want to point out is that when faced with someone dealing with a situation like this it is not always easy to know what to say, or how to act around them. If you have not been through something they are dealing with sometimes it's easy to feel out of place and awkward. After all, you are walking across a verbal landmine when dealing with their feelings. This is the impression I have gotten from the aforementioned people. I don't believe malice was the intention. I just think misguided ideas mixed with poorly thought out wording is more to blame. The people I am referring to are not inherently bad people. They are just people who have fallen back on their piss poor religious teachings (I prefer the term failings) to get the answer they seek. What I would have preferred in that instance was not a helpful word, but understanding silence. Sometimes I don't feel like sharing everything with everyone. I don't want to have to relive that event every time I am faced with a new person who wants to experience it vicariously through me. I try to take something positive from every experience I face, but in this instance I am failing to find the silver lining. He was 18 years old. He had his whole life in front of him and instead of accepting the help he was offered he let his pride get the better of him, and let his emotional problems consume him. He lead a short, tragic life, and he left behind the heartbroken people that cared about him the most to try and pick up the pieces. They say time heals all, but it has only been a week. Right now more than anything I just need people in my life to let me process this in my own way, and in my own time.

Here is a theologian discussing contradictions in the Bible. If this is the scholarly thought they have to offer, I'm not impressed. 

&gt;All four gospels contradict each other on the details of Jesus’s last moments and resurrection. The gospels of Matthew and Luke contradict each other on the genealogy of Jesus’s father Joseph. 

&gt;Or, there appear to be contradictions, such as how did Judas die. In Matthew it says, “He cast down the pieces of silver from the temple and he departed and hanged himself.” But in Acts, he falls headlong, he bursts, his guts rush out. It's a different story. 

&gt;But I don't really understand why people--**male atheists, I suspect**--sort of people who are like trainspotters. I don't understand why they spend hours compiling these long tedious lists of scriptural contradictions. 

&gt;We've known that the bible isn't inerrant since the late 17th century when philosophers and theologians did begin to notice that there were all sorts of contradictions and inconsistencies. So, these contradiction spotters, these great compilers, aren't merely behind the times. I also want to say, they are theological illiterates. These people make all sorts of category mistakes about the nature of god. 

&gt;Because, god isn't a heavenly man sitting behind a desk, compiling, more or less successfully, treatises about the nature and history of everything. In fact, as a theologian, I would want to say that god isn't another object that exists in the universe. In fact, **god doesn't exist at all.** God is existence. Or, as mystics might want to say, god is the only thing that exists. Therefore, god contains within god's self all things including contradictions.

This was spoken by Melissa Raphael-Levine, professor of religious theology. Aired on BBC Radio, *[Stephen Fry's English Delight](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tgd1b)*, August 25, 2010.

So, when someone says you are over-simplifying religious beliefs, you are actually doing them a favor. This is the nonsense under the surface.

The goal of the subreddit is to have discussions about specific topics about the tactics that our former religions employ to convert, control, and retain members.

Check out the subreddit sidebar or the wiki page for the current topics.

It is brand-new, and very rough. We need content, we need discussions. Although we emphasize people who were former members and missionaries, we invite anyone who has relevant input.

For example, I tried inviting /r/childfree, since many religions emphasize the Quiver Full lifestyle of getting married as young as possible and immediately having as many children as possible, prohibiting birth control and personal choice. The overt purpose is to raise an army of the next generation who will fight in Armageddon against non-Christians. It can be called a Christian Eugenics/Breeding program, with the sole purpose of out-populating rival groups.

The subreddit is looking for specifics, not generalities. Example: If you are a former Mormon, then talk about the specific things that Mormonism teaches or requires. We can then compile what Mormons do, and lay it next to what Jehovah's Witnesses do, and find the similarities and differences.

God can't exist in physical reality.

Many agnostics understand that gods do not – and cannot – exist in physical reality, so they create “Dimension X,” and place the possibility of gods existing somewhere “out there.”

Alternate dimensions cannot be invented that only contain gods, but rather must be a general concept that encompasses everything. The true argument put forward by agnosticism is not that “Dimension X may contain gods,” but rather that “nothing true can be said about our reality, because another reality may exist where truth equals falsehood.”

 In other words, the agnostic position is that any positive statement must be instantly negated by the possibility of an “opposite dimension.”

That was a bit of a short summary of the book ""Against The Gods"". If you want to read it in its entirety, and find out the effect of taking agnosticism to its logical conclusion, there is a free PDF copy here.

Edit 2: Thanks for the intelligent conversation that eventually occured. My apologies as most of the conflicts that occured were caused by not defining my terms, and using such an empty word as god. It would be more accurate to say that beings with contradictory properties are impossible, from which we can conclude that they do not exist.

Ok, so I'm going with a Dawkins meme-plex model here (lots of mutually supporting ideas that propagate together):

* Faith is a virtue
* Questioning is disrespectful of authority
* Authority should be obeyed
* Obedience is a virtue
* Kill unbelievers

In discussion with friends about this I keep finding myself drawn back to the first idea, that Faith is a virtue, and I think if a person can be brought to question that, then everything else they might believe is also called into question.

Its no coincidence that all religions require faith and promote it. They also seem happy to have little truces and cease-fires with each other, as long as the other religion also promotes faith. When religions come together in understanding, they call it inter-faith co-operation. Its as if they subconciously recognise that its more important to believe the statement ""faith is a virtue"" than to share other beliefs like ""my god is the only god"". Translated, its as if they recognise that the most important thing is that people accept that ""believing in things because you want to is just fine, doesn't matter if its true"" than ""my madeup thing is better than your imaginary thing"".

Its like religions are all agreeing not to call each other out on their bullshit. 

I mean, they probably view other religions as idiotic, wrong, delusional, embarrassing, corrupt, nonsense, or the devils work, yet despite this they are willing to work together sometimes, and promote the importance of faith, as if faith itself is the important thing.

While on one level I support inter-faith dialogue, mainly for its benefits in peace-building work in conflict zones, I also find it strange and fascinating. 

In terms of defeating religion, I think we waste our time poiunting out the flaws in christianity or scientology or mormonism or what-have-you. A new religion could form at any point, or an existing cult become popular, or a main religion splinter, etc. Fighting the symptoms, even successfully, might not get rid of the problem.

My best friend played a stunning set that blew me away (which is the reason I was in the church). Normally I do not find myself at churches unless supporting family or friends, which happens quite a bit here in Phoenix. Everything was going swimmingly - a mention of jesus here and there, but for the most part the bands stayed the course and just played a damn good show. Finally my friend and his band head on stage. They begin to set up and are just about ready, when the sound technician, which apparently was the churches pastor, ran up on stage and began to preach. 

Here is the just of what he said: ""We know some of you may not believe, and we wont judge you for it, but you should know that there is a battle going on. Evil demons are trying to kill you, take your life away, but jesus has a plan for you and if you accept him you will survive."" 

OK! Thats enough. I begin to shake, trembling with angst. My other friend who joined us for the show grabbed my hand and tried to calm me down. I was furious, mind you there were children at this event (6th grade and up), and I thought, ""What does it feel like to be a monster that preaches such horrible and sadistic things to children. Who abuses their trust and sways them into a deluded reality of fear and violence."" I am firm anti theist and I felt the need to stop this war monger, yet, just in time, my friend on stage looks me in the eye with that kind of ""C'mon just pull it together for me buddy"" look and I turn my head standing there in silence. 

I have never been more confirmed in my hatred for religion. The delusion that a war is going on is erroneous. Recruiting children is abuse. Lying to them is debauchery. How can such a disgusting pastor live with his illusions of grandeur? He is evidently maniacal. I had always enjoyed Mr. Hitchens and his motivational angst towards religion, but now I understand exactly where it comes from. A curdling swell of disgust in the stomach builds up, especially when children become a target, and the repulsive nature of Christianity becomes so evidently clear. 

Has anyone else had experiences like this? Actively repulsed my religion and incapable of doing anything? Interested to hear from you all.

I was going to post this last week, but then the events in Boston occurred and I thought it better to wait.

**TLWR**: Harris, Dawkins and Hitchens have come under fire for comments relating to Islam. Essentially, their harsh criticisms of the faith/religion/worldview/ideology of Islam were/are interpreted as ""Islamaphobic"" and bigoted.

[**Here**](http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/response-to-controversy2/) is Sam Harris' response to his critic's allegations of Islamaphobia and racism, in addition to several other arguments, including torture and collateral damage. It's a good read and I highly recommend it if you have the time. If you don't have the time, or reading isn't your thing, [**here**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY8fjFKAC5k) (~8 min.) is a video of the late Hitchens essentially describing the same inclinations (in regards to Islam/Islamaphobia). 

It is from this talk that Hitchens said that religion should be treated with ""ridicule, hatred, and contempt"", which is in line with the description on the sidebar, that 

&gt;this community is made for those of us who find religion repugnant to human progress, scientific literacy, and civil liberties in general. The community is designed for people who guide their beliefs and actions with reason...we don't afford religion any undue respect. We respect religious people as human beings, but openly criticize their beliefs without fear of reprisal or social backlash.

I think the backlash Harris and Dawkins are experiencing stem from the lack of organized condemnation religion receives today and the unintentional protection liberal theism lends to the fringes. Sure, there is much talk on inequality between believers and non-believers, and that religion is unnecessary but acceptable assuming it is in private, but the only people who are openly critical of it in all regards and noticed are very few and far between. Only a handful of names are really associated with antitheism, and the most vocal and prominent of them all passed away almost two years ago. Hitchens was a self-described anti-theist. Harris is critical of religion, especially Islam as of late, but doesn't appear to consider himself as an anti-theist. Likewise, Dawkins is very critical but hasn't used the term to my knowledge. 

A google search of antitheism just brings up a bunch of definitions, with /r/antitheism itself being number six on the return. If /r/atheism is the largest collection of atheists on the internet, then I would imagine this sub is the largest for anti-theists (arguments that /r/atheism is really full of antitheists aside).

So I ask, what can be done? I think Harris is correct when he accuses liberalism as being complicit by its silence in the rise of religious radicalism. There are dozens of sites dedicated to freethinking, secularism, humanism, and atheism, but I can find few that have a focus like this sub. Every few days, a post is submitted to /r/atraxi that is exactly the reason why I hold religion in contempt. The videos often have little to do with America or American Christianity, but all I see is a different side of the same die displaying different versions of the same untruth, and I think that making that connection with liberals theists more evident or obvious is the most important point to make.

It seriously pissed me off, I thought y'all should take a peek at it and be prepared for it. 

-----------------------------------------------

Apparently the White House referred to Christmas Trees as “Holiday Trees” for the first time this year which prompted CBS presenter, Ben Stein, to present this piece which I would like to share with you. I think it applies just as much to many countries as it does to America . . .

The following was written by Ben Stein and recited by him on CBS Sunday Morning Commentary.

My confession:

I am a Jew, and every single one of my ancestors was Jewish. And it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautiful lit up, bejewelled trees, Christmas trees. I don't feel threatened. I don't feel discriminated against. That's what they are, Christmas trees.

It doesn't bother me a bit when people say, “Merry Christmas” to me. I don't think they are slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto. In fact, I kind of like it. It shows that we are all brothers and sisters celebrating this happy time of year. It doesn't bother me at all that there is a manger scene on display at a key intersection near my beach house in Malibu. If people want a crib, it's just as fine with me as is the Menorah a few hundred yards away.

I don't like getting pushed around for being a Jew, and I don't think Christians like getting pushed around for being Christians. I think people who believe in God are sick and tired of getting pushed around, period. I have no idea where the concept came from, that America is an explicitly atheist country. I can't find it in the Constitution and I don't like it being shoved down my throat.

Or maybe I can put it another way: where did the idea come from that we should worship celebrities and we aren't allowed to worship God? I guess that's a sign that I'm getting old, too. But there are a lot of us who are wondering where these celebrities came from and where the America we knew went to.

In light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh, this is a little different: This is not intended to be a joke; it's not funny, it's intended to get you thinking.

Billy Graham's daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her: “How could God let something like this happen?” (regarding Hurricane Katrina). Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said: “I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we've been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?”

In light of recent events... terrorists attack, school shootings, etc. I think it started when Madeleine Murray O'Hare (she was murdered, her body found a few years ago) complained she didn't want prayer in our schools, and we said OK. Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school. The Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbour as yourself. And we said OK.

Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave, because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr. Spock's son committed suicide). We said an expert should know what he's talking about. And we said okay.

Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.

Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with 'WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.'

Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says. Funny how you can send 'jokes' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing. Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.

Are you laughing yet?

Funny how when you forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it.

Funny how we can be more worried about what other people think of us than what God thinks of us.

Pass it on if you think it has merit.

If not, then just discard it.... no one will know you did. But if you discard this thought process, don't sit back and complain about what bad shape the world is in.

My Best Regards, Honestly and respectfully,

Ben Stein

YOU PAY MORE, SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO.



With the US elections fast approaching, it's a good idea to keep vigilant for any breach by religious organisations of 501(c)3 rules and restrictions. Specifically to endorse or campaign against any particular candidate violates the rules and leaves the guilty organisation openly risking their tax exempt status.

This is highlighted in the case of Branch Ministries Vs Rossotti where full page advertisements were taken to discourage the voting of Bill Clinton. The only problem with this case is how obviously unambiguous it is, leaving much still to be tested in the courts.
Ironically when claiming they had been individually prosecuted and claimed their selection was a violation of the equal protection clause of the fifth amendment, the church produced ""HUNDREDS"" of articles by religious organisations endorsing or campaigning against specific candidates in an attempt to show how other religious organisations had breached the rules but retained their tax exempt status.

In the USA the church is not required to file forms 990 as other 501(c)3 organisations are.  Nor are they required to make these available for inspection upon request as other 501(c)3 organisations do.

In effect the financial arrangements of the church remain completely unchecked and wide open to all manner of corruption. Churchgoers will be unaware of the percentage of donated monies used for lobbying government over helping the poor and needy.  The amounts paid out to silence victims of child abuse remain concealed, along with all their revenue and expenditure.

IRS rules prevent any organisation from engaging in actively supporting or campaigning against a particular political candidate. Failure to abide by the IRS rules can lead to the revocation of an organisation as is shown in the case  cited above.
It is estimated anything from a quarter to a half of a typical American city or town's ""public"" buildings are owned by the church and despite many if not most being used for business purposes and not religious matters, they still enjoy complete exemption from property taxes. The property assets of the church runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars.


For some perspective here, property taxes at the state level make up approx 65% of revenue, and at this time of austerity for every person and every service by government, it's time this unfair privileged exemption is challenged and revoked from all religion.

Keep an eye out for any clear violations of the IRS rules where it concerns the endorsement or attack of any particular candidate. Keep newspaper cuttings, bookmark pages containing evidence of breaches and the breaches will be submitted to the IRS for their consideration, and action.

CHURCH TAX EXEMPTION,  IS CHURCH SUBSIDY. A subsidy paid in part by atheists to help religion afford its contributing $390 000 000 annually to lobby government on issues such as abortion and bioethics, to name just two.

I need to take a detour for a moment.

Mormons are quick to deny that paying tithing is required to go to heaven.

Let's disprove this denial.

According to the [""Preach My Gospel"" manual that all Mormon missionaries use to teach about the church:](http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-15-the-covenant-of-baptism?lang=eng)

- Baptism is required of us if we are to enter the kingdom of God 

- Baptism is necessary for us to become members of the Church of Jesus Christ upon the earth

- Baptism must be performed by one having authority (i.e. an ordained Mormon Priest)

By this, one must conclude that the LDS Church teaches that it is the only church that is allowed to perform legitimate baptisms that get you into heaven.

But, there are [requirements to getting baptized:](http://www.lds.org/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-prepare-people-for-baptism-and-confirmation?lang=eng)

During the interview with the Mormon Bishop, he makes sure that you will commit to certain obligations. If you do not commit to these obligations, you are not allowed to be baptized. These instructions are prefaced as orders from First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve, the two highest bodies in the LDS Church.

- Live the principles of moral worthiness (i.e. no sex outside marriage, no gay sex, no gay marriage)

- Live the Word of Wisdom (i.e. no booze, no coffee, no tea, no tobacco, no illegal drugs, no meat between Spring and Fall)

- **Commit to pay tithing.**

**TL;DR: Paying tithing is required for baptism. Baptism is required for going to heaven.**

-----

End of detour.

We now know that tithing is required by the LDS church for its members to go to heaven.

At some point, these private donations were develop the for-profit arm of the Mormon Church, which has ballooned into a giant web.

Property Reserve falls within this web, and is the corporation in question.

1. Mormons pay tithing to avoid hell

2. The Mormon Church buys properties

3. The Mormon Church sells expensive properties to its top leaders for $10

4. The Mormon Church helps them them sell the property

5. ~~Prophet~~ Profit

Normally, if you had an idea of how something happened, and your idea was challenged by a better-supported theory, you'd change your idea to either incorporate the theory if your idea still offered more explanatory power, or drop the idea completely if it did not.

Such is not exactly the case when theological claims to truth are challenged in the same way. The only recourse when a theological idea is proven completely wrong is to re-interpret the basis for the idea to allow the theory to co-exist with it, or attempt to discredit the conflicting theory by any means possible. Why they cannot change the basis for the idea is obvious - any admittance that the bible was wrong hurts its credibility greatly.

They cannot simply edit the bible, out of fear that it will lose its grounds for authority, which is the idea that it is holy: it must be seen as indirectly written, or at the very least inspired, by a God that has omnipotence, benevolence, and omniscience credited to it. Although I guarantee that the different sects of Christianity could never agree on allowing one group or person to edit the bible, even if they did, by inserting their own values, they would simply be calling attention to what I consider one of the bible's greatest weaknesses - that it is a reflection of human morality, not a source of it.

The only question left is, how much bending of the bible before it breaks? How many flimsy justifications, reinterpretations, and citations of mistranslations until it completely loses all validity among Christians? If they attempt to edit the bible to be more accurate to the facts and more reflective of modern morality, it could be the death of Christianity. If they do not, the encroaching acceptance of knowledge will eventually topple the resulting excuses.",,False,self,t5_2qq2r,False,,,True,t3_11awwp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/11awwp/is_christianity_doomed_it_both_must_and_must_not/,

You see posts preaching morality and comments bashing Christians right under them. It just seems like a huge hypocrisy to me anymore.

Now here is the issue.

Government still funds the church, priests etc. are still employed by the government. 

You become a member at birth if only one of your parents is a member. You need the signature of both to be deleted from the church registry before the age of 18. 

The ""state church"" is still not a legal entity that can be sued like the rest of the other ""belief organizations""

According to polls the majority of the population are either atheist or agonstic (54 %). Including those who say that religion is not really important in their lives we are up to 86%. How can this be !?! (2% of church members attend church on a regular basis)

People use the church for traditonal purposes. They get married in chruch, buried, confirmated and baptised even though the majoirity don't really belive in god. They do it due to tradition and don't really give a fuck.

The church could not elect it's own leaders until now. The government did it, and they elected curch leaders who where totally toothless. We have gay and female priests and a newly proposed law will make it illegal for priests to refuse marrying gay couples. 

Church services during Christmas hardly contains any christian content at all. In my opinion the church is smart and adapt to the audience (most people attend curch once a year (christmas) unless some relatives have died... Funerals etc.

Those who really are religous are not among the 80% of the population who are members of the church as they do not precieve it as christian enough. They are members of other more fundamentalist churches. Less than half of the 20% who are not members are atheists.

The church has been held by their ears so hard by the government that they could not really be controversial, now that they can elect it's own leaders they can. I would assume  they will stray away from the common values in our society now. 

if that happens i guess that most people will still not give a fuck and still be members as it gives no tax benefits for not being a member. However, we will most likely continue the trend with a decreasing number of people who are members in the church.

With the Bible, it has been mistranslated so badly as to be useless, because we can't know which parts are original and which have been influenced. If not mistranslated, it is contradictory and orders followers to do things that would get them sent to jail in modern society. If we ignore certain passages out of the Bible, then it loses its claim to absolute morality as we have assumed the role of God, determining what is right and wrong.

And finally, with God, an entity either nonexistent or so incompetent as to be laughable. Why do we drink and breathe from the same hole? Why do we need a constant supply of water to live? Why do things like cancer and Parkinson's exist? Any answer to these questions such as ""We have to learn it ourselves"" is unacceptable, since in the case of an all-powerful creator, we could have been born with said knowledge and saved a lot of pain.

They get credit for it because they do a better job of tying the good works they do to their creed. But according to a 1998 study, 82% of volunteerism by churchgoers falls under the rubric of ""church maintenance"" activities -- volunteerism entirely within, and for the benefit of, the church building and immediate church community. As a result of this siphoning of volunteer energy into the care and feeding of churches themselves, most of the volunteering that happens out in the larger community -- from AIDS hospices to food shelves to international aid workers to those feeding the hungry and housing the homeless and caring for the elderly -- comes from the category of ""unchurched"" volunteers.

I think what he's saying here is important..  also to [/r/atheism](/r/atheism).. so here it is, Carl Sagan's timeless wisdom nuggets.*


""In the way that skepticism is sometimes applied to issues of public concern, there is a tendency to belittle, to condescend, to ignore the fact that, deluded or not, supporters of superstition and pseudoscience are human beings with real feelings, who, like the skeptics, are trying to figure out how the world works and what our role in it might be. Their motives are in many cases consonant with science. If their culture has not given them the all the tools they need to pursue this great quest, let us temper our criticism with kindness. None of us comes fully equipped.

Clearly there are limits to the uses of skepticism. There is some cost-benefit analysis which must be applied, and if the comfort, consolation and hope delivered by mysticism and superstition is high and the dangers of belief comparatively low, should we not keep our misgivings to ourselves?  But the issue is tricky.  Imagine that you enter a big-city taxicab and the moment you get settled in, the driver begins a harangue about the supposed iniquities and inferiority's of another ethnic group. Is your best course to keep quiet, bearing in mind that silence conveys assent?  Or is it your moral responsibility to argue with him, to express outrage, even to leave the cab because you know that every silent assent will encourage him next time?  Likewise, if we offer too much silent assent about mysticism and superstition, even when it seems to be doing a little good, we abet a general climate in which skepticism is considered impolite, science tiresome, and rigorous thinking somehow stuffy and inappropriate. Figuring out a prudent balance takes wisdom.""",,False,self,t5_2qq2r,False,,,True,t3_q1btn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/q1btn/wise_words_from_carl_sagan_relevant_to_the_cause/,

I submitted a post a bit back about a Hassidic Jewish friend that wanted to debate theology and evolution. Here it is: http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/1ht5b6/debating_the_old_testament_with_fundamentalist/

It lead to a very, very interesting discussion.

For one, skepticism is actually greatly encouraged in Judaism! Just not directed at judaism. When the Quran was brought up, my friend **jumped** at the idea of proving them all murderous fools. Or even christianity, those were clearly the more deluded. Just not anything related to their holy book (he actually grew visibly concerned when I googled ""skeptic's annotated bible"" on his pc) because...

He admitted that if there is but one flaw in the holy book, it's not holy. Nevermind that it says that bats lay eggs, or that ants have a sense of property and assign tasks, if a flaw is found, we will fight to bitter tears to find an explanation no matter how desperate. Which really brings me to **the reason I made this thread**. The creation of Adam and Eve.

Anyone with even a cursory understanding of Judeo-Christian religion knows that man came first, then woman from rib. But Genesis says:

&gt;1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

Which is either a typo, a metaphor, or bsing as you go along. But there was no doubt in my friend's mind, who immediately explained it as:

&gt;of course, adam and eve were one body

&gt;&gt;like one soul, in spirit?

&gt;no, like siamese twins. Adam was front, Eve was back

I won't resort to reaction images. Just google one until it tickles your fancy. It took every ounce of my will to not shit myself laughing right now. The perfect god creator made the first (she)man a twisted moster with titties sticking out of his back, and a face in the back of his head. And he looked upon it and it was good. I imagine Eve had a POV every time her husband/mutant siamese twin brother took a shit. How lovely.

&gt;&gt;then what does the rib story refer to?

&gt;oh god separated them with a kind of plastic surgery

i can't... no more...

The Anti-Theist’s Tale


There once was a girl named Susie Small,

When news was tragic she would pray and stall.

She would pray to her “god” hoping for an answer,

But nothing happened; people were still dying of cancer.

She prayed for the starving, she prayed for poor,

She prayed for riches, fame, glory and much more.

Nothing came true as she awoke the next day,

She had to go to church where she prayed more on Sunday.

Every time she ate dinner she would say grace,

She always forgot to thank the cook, that’s just bad taste.

She didn’t thank the scientists, who modified her meats,

Nor did she thank the aliens that gathered the beets.

Oh silly Susie, she got in a car crash.

The doctors fixed her up and gave her ointment for a rash.

When she got home she said thanks to her lord.

She forgot to say thanks to the doctors that worked very hard.

Susan’s church and faith was very peculiar,

It was different from other cults that may seem familiar.

Yet they worshipped Yahweh so the government funded them.

Not only had that but Susan given them her life savings.

Giving would generate miracles said the priest,

Just use your prayer rug and you will be pleased.

Susan tried but only experienced disappointment,

She tried a bit harder; she thought she must be important.

She thought and thought why it wasn’t working,

She had a cup she was sipping, Kool-Aid she was drinking.

Susie grew tired from all of the thinking,

She cleaned all the litter boxes because all nine of her cats were stinking.

The next day was a breeze until she saw a commercial,

It was quite sad and a little controversial.

It was of children in Africa starving and in need,

So she dropped her ice-cream and prayed her creed.

“They need god in their lives.” She thought for their lives to extend,

But really they needed food and water, not an imaginary friend.

Every day this behavior would repeat,

Praying and wishing for something neat.

Some may say she’s wasting her time,

I would say she needs to hear about Sagan or Bill Nye.

The sad thing is there’s millions of Susie’s,

They only seem to linger and thrive in first world countries.

The moral here is to be skeptical and have health

If you want something done, then please help yourself.

It didn't really work and people keep telling me that it's a pointless debate. I feel very ""green"" in this debate because I don't feel like I get the opportunity to discuss these issues in an adult manner, as I spend more time fending off attacks than actually getting anywhere.

Thanks for indulging me.

---

I know that people hate Dawkins for a myriad of reasons, but if it weren't for him, I think that I'd be a very confused and lonely atheist going crazy in my own head.

So many people seem to interpret ""atheist"" as ""anti-theist"", meaning that I must be highly intolerant and hate anyone that has faith. There is so much stigma that I am led to feel guilty if I publicly express that I don't understand why an all-powerful being would write a book telling me how awesome he is and how I will be punished for not being grateful and accepting to play his game. 

I am still scared of being too vocal about religion - any religion - because it is so protected (even by law) and people misunderstand the intention behind discussing it casually or openly. People are so caught up in ""respect"" that they sacrifice understanding at the alter of this respect. The fear of blasphemy leads to huge self-censorship and the censorship of others.

Even if I am opposed to faith that doesn't mean that I lack humanity, empathy, or compassion. It doesn't mean that I attribute a different worth to groups of people that are different to me.

I picked up my copy of the Quran and started reading it from the beginning. This is from the second ""chapter""; there are a total of 12 verses (lines) from the beginning of the Quran to this part:

&gt;(from 2. Al-Baqarah)

&gt;Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.

&gt;Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.

&gt;And of the people are some who say, ""We believe in Allah and the Last Day,"" but they are not believers.

&gt;They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.

&gt;In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.

&gt;And when it is said to them, ""Do not cause corruption on the earth,"" they say, ""We are but reformers.""

&gt;Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.

------------------

How very useful for a book to start from the beginning by discrediting its opposition as deluded liars with whom you should not engage. And yet it seems to be an odd punishment of a loving God that gave us freedom to increase our disease and give us a painful punishment for our ""lies"".

If that is freedom and that is the truth, I do not want to be a part of it.",,False,self,t5_2qq2r,False,,,True,t3_yx2bl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/yx2bl/i_came_here_because_posting_this_on_facebook_only/,

Yes, Faux News, but it's not too long of a story. 

A rather conservative and Christian friend of mine posted this on Facebook along with his opinion. He called the group who complained about not receiving a discount whiners, etc. His main point was that a private business can serve whomever they want, however they want, and that others cannot interfere with that. 

I'm in agreement with that- private business is private, and should be allowed to do their own thing. The point I tried to make to him is this: if it were a Muslim group, or an atheist group, Jewish group, etc etc etc, that got the discount and the Christian group did not, religious discrimination would be called left and right. I feel that discounts should be given for a proper reason, such as civil service, and not because you believe (or don't believe) in one god over another. 

To draw another obvious parallel, if groups were given discounts because they were supporters of a specific racial supremacy- white, black, I don't give a fuck- society would flip it's lid. But it's okay to tell people that they are more valuable as customers because of their proclaimed belief in Allah or God or whatever?

Shouldn't anti-theism have a more gnostic component than atheism? (obviously ""blind faith"" would be retarded, I am saying more gnostic, not completely)

As anti theists we're going further than normal atheists, we actually fight religion, even if its just on an intellectual level. We can't 100% know, that there's no god, at least not on a scientific basis (except for Occam's razor) but still we're actively speaking out against religion. 

Does this have a gnostic basis (I am sure/I believe there is no god, so I have to fight religion) or an agnostic basis (I don't believe although I can't tell for sure, but it is my opinion, that religion is detrimental for humanity, so I fight it anyways) for you guys?

I actually think that my a(nti)theism has a gnostic basis. I have philosophically proved to myself, that there is no god, or at least not a god that even just closely resembles the god of any of the abrahamic religions. My favourite argument is, that the existence of a god only throws up questions but doesn't answer any questions:

For example: 

Why is there suffering? - Because our society isn't perfect and there is no higher being that prevents suffering, so bad behaviour like crime is viable. 

If you assume, that there is an all-loving god, it brings up the problem, that is stated in this [very famous quote](http://thinkexist.com/quotation/is-god-willing-to-prevent-evil-but-not-able-then/411189.html). 

Also, you can always explain religion by looking at how cults operate these days. Apparently one can trick people into pretty much anything.

The only question, that is really unanswered, even these days is ""What was before the big bang?"" And since religion can't prove it's explanation in a non-circular way ...

Anyways, this is not a scientifically acceptable kind of proof, but for my believe it is enough to say, that I am kind of gnostic atheist.

\begin{letter}{International Court of Justice \ Peace Palace \ Carnegieplein 2 \ 2517 KJ The Hague \ The Netherlands}

\opening{Dear Dr. Tomka}

I was recently made aware of the scale of the Catholic sex abuse scandal. Being generally too busy to follow the news in depth I had never before realised the scale of the problem. Rapist priests have been being moved around for decades, avoiding prosecution by the law of the land of whichever country they are in, with the Vatican, while knowing about most of the cases, doing nothing to punish the rapists - some are sent to a clinic for a few weeks perhaps and then moved to a parish were the congregation are unaware of past allegations against the priest in question.

My question to you is this: why has there not been a full investigation into the Vatican and the Catholic church? Since 2001, Cardinal Ratzinger had the paperwork of every molestation case put on his desk. Arguably, then, the most knowledgable person when it comes to the scandal is former Pope Benedict XI. I don't recall him ever informing the police of the names of any priests that deserve to be imprisoned. Thus it would seem that the whole Catholic church from the Vatican down is implicated in the scandal, and those commit child rape and those who protect the rapists from punishment deserve to be brought to justice.

It seems that the church believe their wealth and size can protect them. One recent estimate states that the church have spent \$2 billion on covering up the scandal, including settlements to victims. I feel strongly that it should be proved that the church is not above the law and not indestructible.

I look forward to your reply and any plans you have in tackling the issue.

However, it is important to know what religion is and how it differs from dogma. Entirely, dogma is singular whereas religion is plural. Specifically, dogma is a system or doctrine that is believed to be incontrovertibly true and is recognized only when one believes. This is harmless and almost impossible to remove, as there will always be someone with a mental illness ranting dogma. We can remove them easily and their dogma is clearly renounced and eliminated. Religion, in contrast, requires a group of people believing in dogma. This is more dangerous as it becomes harder for some to recognize their mental illness, as their ideas are justified by others. For instance, a small kid can understand a single person is crazy because they can see that they behave differently than the large majority ([since children are mostly feelers](http://www.actforyouth.net/resources/rf/rf_brain_0502.pdf)).  When a group of people agree to the crazy idea [it becomes difficult to distinguish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkJc6c3nKMw). This conformity is hazardous because it can make a rational thinker into a slave to their doctrine.  Therefore, dogma itself is not the problem, its religion (or a cult, I see no difference).

but I have a really important 
question... ",38,13,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/wfhq7/strongly_leaning_towards_antitheism_but_i_have_a/,"Obviously I'm new here. **If you just want to know the question, please skip to the end - this is long**.

I won't bother you with my interesting religious/mystical/bizarre/pagan phase/back to hippie phase/agnostic history, complete with brainwashing, indocrination, cults, culminating with the death of my mother who tortured me psychologically in a psychoesque manner and the recent dissolution of my family.

I begin here as an *Atheist Agnostic*. You will notice that this will gradually change in this very post.

Whenever I got seriously ill, or that one time I ate HBWR seeds to get high, and I thought I was dying, I was desperate and I was like, ""*yeah God, okay, I believe, I believe in the power! Alright mate, you win! I don't want eternal suffering please come on I love you God!!!*""

But that was like a desperate move to get out of a shitty situation, so I was trying really hard to convince myself that ""God is Love"" cuz he ""saved"" me from that hell of some serious illness, because my stomach has taken quite a few punches at my age. So in really really desperate times, I'd believe in God for a day, back to agnostic but like ""*God help me when I'm in shitty situations*"". When I say believe, it's a very vague and abstract concept, not faith. I don't have that, I never had. Hope is a different thing, though.

So if that is God then whatever it is is an asshole and I want to kill the motherfucker because ""Satan"" would be cooler. Killing him would free society from most, if not all of our current problems. 

Though in the HBWR trip after I calmed down it was awesome, I ""lost my ego"" and could suddenly see through all those filters of reality that people don't want to face - our completely **natural, animal nature**. Our ""true"" purpose, as I see it, is to advance as a species intellectually, as this is the only thing that makes us unique in any way. We must lose our myths, but we must not distance ourselves from nature - because we need it for our very own survival. We're literally made of nature, earthly and not. We can, should and must evolve alongside nature. I see only **religion** as our *animal nature* which we can and **must lose** as well. That trip was 8 years ago, 3 small seeds. I had forgotten all about it, but it came back with a vengeance.

I am gobsmacked that most people are brainwashed from infancy, and gradually interpret that world through filters, which are almost always lies and illusions, and this will always have a sad ending, which is death which frightens most people (not me) the idea of being meaningless and living only once.
Deal with it and let's move on as a species. Religion makes prisoners, I say enjoy your life and embrace your natural side. Science is an example of that, natural curiosity. Religion is a result of a denial of reality which has reached a point where it's used as an excuse, a crutch, a social and geopolitical  manipulation tool.

That goes back to primitive humans who had sacrifice and cannibalism in the beginning (we're still having it, along with slavery, but don't tell anyone). But now it's time to stop being childish and believing in ridiculous things. That's because it's either that or we'll suffer more unnecessarily, and humanity might soon be a thing of the past - and perhaps the entire planet as well.

I mean, **really**?

Science is our greatest achievement and has been/is actually helping mankind in a multitude of ways.

I'm sure we are intellectually advanced enough to figure out that if that bullshit tactic worked for millenia, but **it is not inherent in us**, it isn't working at all and just causing damage. I go to /r/worldnews and half or more of the posts are about some stupid religious conflict. Even if it's a war for control of a place, crazy authoritarian regimes, really it's all because of those silly lies.

I am becoming quite vocal about my hatred of religion and cults and I can't help it anymore. I say fuck religion, fuck cults, fuck mysticism, fuck ghosts, let's stop the bullshit. I am not in America but my country has lots of religions and it's fucking insane around here. This area of the city in particular, while diverse in its illusions, is great for money-making charlatans, outspoken religious fanatics, and well, fuck that.

Wait a min, am I leaning towards Anti-Theism or Nihilism? Not sure.

I am sorry for the rant, this makes me livid. I've experienced a lot of personal shit in my life because of this too. I guess I'll sum it up.

**TL;DR: How do I stop the problem of calling out ""God"" out of habit and a last resort in really desperate situations? *Even if I think it's time to abandon religion because it's not needed and damaging humanity itself, and I don't really believe in shit anyway.

Anyway, on with what I was going to say.

I have a few questions about anti-theism, and asked myself ""Who would best answer my questions about anti-theism? Oh yes, actual anti-theists."" So here I am, I may also be an anti-theist, but as of now I only have a basic understanding and can't really make a claim like that when I don't have all the facts. Without further ado, here I go.

1. Are anti-theists against belief in all Gods, against organized institutions of religion, both, or none of the above?

2. On what grounds do anti-theists oppose religion (and belief in Gods if that's the case, if not then please ignore this)?

3. From your pretty cool banner, I can see you're against superstition (such as luck, ghosts, etc.) Does this mean you're rationalists as well?

4. What's the reason for your hard stance against religion, rather than just being atheists and not having belief in God(s)?

Okay, now that I'm done with the questions. I will explain my stances and see if they line up with yours as you post them, or you can just confirm whether or not I am an anti-theist.

First off, I am not against people believing in Gods, people are entitled to their religious/spiritual beliefs. However, I do see their beliefs in their Gods or other supernatural beings as irrational, since their beliefs are centered around just that: beliefs. I do also have a distaste for religious institutions. Throughout history (and even recent history to an extent), they have been seen using their beliefs to justify oppression of peoples' rights, hindering the advancement of mankind (especially regarding science) based on their faith, and other things.

Next, you can see the reasons why I oppose religion, so I'm just going to leave that as is and not add more than I need to.

I am against superstition as well, especially the paranormal. While I find the paranormal to be quite an interesting topic, there is no proof from what I've seen there is no real scientific, peer-reviewed, and valid evidence proving that the existence of spirits contacting people from the grave and haunting places in the real-world. So I can't really say that I actually believe in the paranormal.

The fourth one is for you, I'm just curious as to what motivates you to do so. I myself, am not really against religion itself, I'm just opposed to batshit crazy, unproven, faith and belief-based things get in the way of things in the real world.

I thought I would see a smattering of their shit in posts. Instead I found everything I hate about Christian hubris in one post. How do I respond without being ""that atheist."" 

&gt;Morality is not innate, moral behavior is something that is taught. This is why god gave us the ten commandments and the teachings of Jesus Christ. We were given these revelations so that we may understand morality and right and wrong. The ideas of morality are not something we are born with. If we were born with these ideas we would not need to have this conversation. If moral behavior was something innate we would not have to debate this issue, because every five year old would act morally correct. Now I’ve never seen a five year old act in a moral way, unless they were taught. So without religion and the teachings of God we would wander this earth like wolves acting on instinct alone.
&gt;
&gt;The very civilization we live in that has given us the ability to debate this topic was created on the foundation of God. Look at the money we print, it says “in god we trust.” For years politics have been trying to separate church and state, like philosophers have been trying to spate moral behavior from religion and it doesn’t work. It won’t work because they are one in the same. They are dependent on each other. No human can be moral without being taught and religion gives us those teachings, and no country can be great with a strong moral foundation which also comes from religion. History speaks for itself! Every great super power on earth has had religion as its foundation. This fact can’t be argued, and the fact so many people want to disprove the idea of religion proves how powerful God is. People spend their entire lives trying to disprove something that cannot be disproven, and yet all I need is faith to confirm my belief. I don’t need experts debating my view or topics in college discussion boards. All I need is the feeling I get when I have God in my life and it’s so powerful, it needs no proof.
&gt;
&gt;Education will continue to try and disprove the teachings of God and the bible; however, sixty percent of the world’s population believes in God. That’s sixty percent of seven billion people believe in God. You would think that number alone would convince the non-believers that God does exist. If God himself came down and stood on earth for all to see, some would still say it was a trick. But when their time comes and death is staring them in the face, I would like to see if they stand by their beliefs, like I will stand by mine.
&gt;
&gt;Will you stand by your beliefs when the time of your death comes?
&gt;
&gt;Would you continue to renounce God if your child was dying?
&gt;
&gt;Would you tell your dying child that no greater place waited for them after death?
&gt;
&gt;How would we evaluate the morality of human actions without God?
&gt;
&gt;This would be a very difficult task. I guess we would have to come together as a society and determine what behaviors we felt we acceptable. But like in the video of Jessie Jackson, we would have to re-evaluate what was morally correct every couple of years.

The childish question ""why do bad things happen"" i think is simple but brilliant, if there were an omniscient deity who was omnipotent and loved us infinintely, why did my grand dad die, why does events such as the Cleveland kidnappings happen. The question may seem naive but i see it to be important, if god makes men do good things like charity then he must also be accountable for those three girls going through a 10 year fate that i find unimaginable. If he is so omnipotent then why not help those girls. 

The counter argument is that it is part of a plan. but if God has a plan then everything is predetermined then we have no free will. if everything is set out before us by god (presumably he is the one calling the shots) why set it out so three girls have to undergo three years of rape.

Of course some Christians will say everything is not predetermined and god has no say in the matter of human events, then what does he actually do if he has no power over anything in our world then can he really be called a god.

But i can use evidence to prove that the christian teachings show that god has a plan, thus everything is predetermined. Take the story of Jesus, the fundamental teaching of Christianity is that god sent Jesus down to die for our sins, then he immediately knew everything between then would follow eg. the persecution, the crucifixion.

I have to add after mentioning that point what that entails to Jews. God knew his son would die for our sins (further evidence of things being predetermined) so he knew the Jews would persecute him. From that we can only gather that he is either very bad at setting up scenarios (not very omniscient) or he wanted to exclude the Jews (his chosen people) from being followers of Christ and missing the teachings his son was destined to give.

                         Faith and Fundamentalism

Regardless which moral precepts you pick from the bible there are others who behave so differently it’s almost like they believe in a different god. You know them well, they are the ones who believe in a six day creation, discriminate against blacks, gays, Muslims, or anyone else that is different, and generally protest everything. They are the fundamentalists. They speak the loudest and despite being in the minority hold significant political power and influence many minds. How can these people read the same book you might ask? Despite their appearance they are actually the most rational believers. They take their religion so seriously they will follow it to the t. Why shouldn’t they? They have a book given to them by god himself, the creator of the universe, the highest being in existence. Everything they do should be influenced by Him. They interpret the bible literally because it doesn’t make any sense to them otherwise. “There are no contradictions, no historical errors, and no moral wrong doings. This is Gods’ Holy Word!” Faith comes before any kind of critical thinking for these people. Faith, the same thing every Christian professes, is the same thing that has destroyed their ability to accept reality. It ruins the individuality of the person and molds them into the collective flock. Indeed, faith, in large enough doses may not move mountains, but it can certainly move buildings. 

Let’s move beyond Christianity and look at the Middle East. What is so different about Islam that suicide bombing seems to pervade constantly? The large majority of Muslims professes no disposition towards violence and will say that the Quran does not either. “It’s the fundamentalists that don’t have the right interpretation!” But let me ask you this: What comes first to you, god or country? If you felt your religion was under attack from foreigners, would you fight back? Would you put on the armor of god and be a soldier in Lord Jesus’s army? “How magnificent to fight with the power of angels for a cause greater than all else! This is the ultimate purpose, to fight Satan and his devils! This gives more meaning to my life than anything else!” How could you resist, especially when you have spent your whole life around death and killing. It’s not about what verse says what anymore. You’ve put your faith in more knowledgeable Imams who defend the violence. Nothing can stop you when god is on your side! 

This is what happens with faith: Your interpretation of the world around you doesn’t depend on your internal morals or critical thinking skills; you have rejected all reason and evidence. You created a substitute for reality, an alternate world where you have all the answers. There is no more questioning, seek and ye shall find. Everything from the creation of the universe, to the beginning of life, and even the end of life has an answer that pleases you. It can be a source of great satisfaction if you’re good enough at accepting its’ pleasures, but it is dangerous enough to kill.

Stevens has finally pushed me to the breaking point; anyone else want to try?,24,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/uqq4m/father_clifford_j_stevens_has_finally_pushed_me/,"As I believe I mentioned in another thread, I've been engaging in some wild-eyed debates with theists of various stripes in Amazon comment discussions. In one I encountered Father Clifford J. Stevens, an 86-year-old priest who initially came off as quite well-read, intelligent and entertaining. However, as I politely attempted to engage him (others had already given up), it soon became apparent that his entire schtick was the classic Cosmological argument and he absolutely refused to directly address any rebuttal of his points, at one point replying to a lengthy rebuttal which I put a lot of time into: ""I cannot make my way through such a catch-all of observations."" He then began to both shift the burden of proof and become personally offensive with remarks like ""Show me the scientific foundation of your Atheism and I will go away, with all my contradictions. But you seem on an island of skepticism for which I certainly do not have a solution and will not try. I don't understand your anger at the world and mass confusion about what human life and existence is all about. What do you really have to offer?""

He also revealed to another poster (which I will make another thread for later - he attempts somewhere else on Amazon to prove to me that ex-Christians don't exist, which provides great amusement) that he's set up his own organization, Pere Lemaitre Foundation for Science and Religion, to ""do battle"" with Richard Dawkins' foundation. I know he also has another organization, the ""National Association for Embryonic Law"", which I'm sure you can guess the intent of. His last post was more obnoxious than usual and I'm rather sick right now and didn't have the strength or patience or frankly the desire to get tough with his arguments. I did post a small response, however. I was wondering if anyone else wanted to ""whack the pinata"" and have a go at the galaxy-sized holes in his arguments. The post in question contains such gems as ""...the first living cell, which no scientist can explain, and Homo Sapiens which turns evolutionary science on its head"". It also has what is essentially a concise summary of his completely unsupported argument that he repeats endlessly regardless of what the actual topic of discussion is:

&gt;There is only on definition of cosmic, biological and human origins 
&gt;that covers the whole enchillada and that is this:
&gt;
&gt;There is one First Being, possessing the fuill perfection of all being, 
&gt;Who of the abundance of His perfection, bestows being upon all that 
&gt;exists, so that He is not only the first of beings, but also the 
&gt;beginning of all.""
&gt;And its corollary:
&gt;
&gt;""God is not confined in time. He is eternala and witout beginning or 
&gt;end. His being is constant, ever present, never altering from past to 
&gt;future. Nothing can be taken away from Him, nothing added. And His 
&gt;name is HE WHO IS. His grandeur exceeds incomparablyl anything 
&gt;that we can know, for He is boundless""
&gt;And the instrument for discovering this is the human intellect and its 
&gt;reasoning powers, which you have reduced to the outgrowths of 
&gt;biology, perhaps the biggest mistake in science since Piltdown Man:
&gt;
&gt;""This is the earthly goal of man: to evolve his intellectual powers to 
&gt;their fullest; to arrive at a maximum of consciousness; to open tghe 
&gt;eyes of his understanding uopn all things, so that upon the tablet of 
&gt;his soul, the whole universe and all its parts maybe enrolled.""

I have a feeling he's drawing upon Aquinas, the old Catholic ""Baltimore Catechism"", or both. Note: Just checked Google, and yep, the man is quoting Aquinas. His arguments are not only stale; they're not even his.

What really pushed my button was his closing uncharacteristic aggressiveness:

&gt;Unless Atheists can do more than repeat endlessly God is dead and 
&gt;Science says so, you are forced into a cosmic, biological and 
&gt;psychological corner weeping your heart out for the days of wine 
&gt;and roses.
&gt;Give me and the world a better explanation for cosmic beginnings 
&gt;that crying in your own cosmic soup or shut up and go home to 
&gt;momma.

I've come to believe that when you get past his prose he's not really saying much of anything, but maybe someone else wants to have a go at the man who makes his ""...first battleground ... the books by eminent scientists like Richard Dawkins, Victor Stenger and Lawrence Krauss, who use their Science as the basis of their atheism. They are using their scientific credibility and their positions as scientists to give validiity to their atheism and that is not only dishonest, but scientifically unethical. "" I politely, respectfully, and very gently tried to discuss (not debate) the Big Questions with him, but I don't see much intellectual honesty on his part.

http://www.amazon.com/review/R4NJUMO5YJY4Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=1591026520&amp;cdForum=Fx15WE1CW55J9QR&amp;cdMsgID=Mx2GCTNZ68G2L5Q&amp;cdMsgNo=33&amp;cdPage=4&amp;cdSort=oldest&amp;cdThread=TxLOTH0BA9EIO4&amp;store=books#Mx2GCTNZ68G2L5Q

He wrote the one-star review of Victor Stenger's God: The Failed Hypothesis that this discussion is contained in. I should have realized from the review that Father Stevens is a man who ambles on amusingly and it's only later that you realize he never actually said anything. Maybe someone who's feeling better than I am right now will have the fortitude to try to pin him down on the faults of his arguments.

Finally realized I had to make a stand on religion and came to the conclusion that worshiping anything really limits who we are and what we can accomplish.

It was only yesterday that I finally made up my mind on religion... Previously, I have always been agnostic. I never really believed in God but if others wanted to, fine, that's their prerogative. I never really cared to ponder God and what it meant. About a month ago, I broke up with my serious girlfriend and she took it pretty hard. We got along great and are still friends but we just weren't compatible as serious partners. Anyway, the breakup pushed her to get closer to God and now she is completely consumed by religion. I thought maybe it'd be good for her, giver her a source of comfort and make her life more bearable and help her move her life forward. I never really expected these consequences. Her entire philosophy, her perspective on life has actually changed. I don't know how we can stay friends because of this... It's not that I have a problem with God or christianity, more likely it's the radical mentality that makes this impossible. To actually worship a god is such a foreign idea to me. Worshiping anything seems ridiculous. It is a radical departure from reality. I realized last night that this is what religion is. I've never had that frame of reference before, and being forced to face the radical mentality of christianity has made me come to terms with my atheism. I realized that theistic belief is actually detrimental to society and that it only serves as a crutch. Its like taking a shortcut in life. It's not true happiness.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is I really don't think the two mindsets are compatible, the antitheist and the religious. The core philosophies are radically opposed and I don't think I can ever see her in the same way again.",,False,self,t5_2qq2r,False,,,True,t3_124wm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/124wm2/is_it_possible_to_coexist/,

However, what is most surprising  people haven't recognized is that science is also a language. Not only is it a way to communicate to others, is given to all whether poor, rich, black, white, asian, indian, christian, or islam. That, must be the greatest things science has offered to us. However it is not surprising how much people accept science as a fundamental to understanding the world, but the struggle scientific denial is bringing. It is astonishing how many children play in their life not understanding how science how created our world and **fucking allowed you to be alive.**Anyways, what is important to know is that in a world we dont trust anyone it is fortunate to realize that person has scientific understanding, and is in the area of reason by his actions making him less crazy. For instance, if one person is learned the sociology or physiology he understands you're how you act and react and will use that information to make him feel more comfortable thus giving him trust from the second person.

&gt;How can we expect people who are committed to a particular faith, as a value transcending all others, to tolerate its open desecration? John Stuart Mill’s argument On Liberty says that we should tolerate even the speech we hate because truth is most likely to emerge in a free intellectual combat from which no idea has been excluded. People with passionate religious convictions think they already know the truth, however, and they can hardly be expected to have more confidence in Mill’s doubtful epistemology than in their own bibles.

I'm sorry you haven't had a good day but you are more than capable of having a conversation without resorting to verbal insults. 
No reason to be sorry for saying something. I'm glad to have a discussion with a good friend.

All this is, is a plot to control the masses, sway votes in the illusion of democracies we live in, and give comfort to the masses that their robotic life styles culminate into something greater than death.

“The Dutch politician Dion Graus has been accused of anti-Semitism.  He stated in a TV broadcast that Jews ‘torture animals, supposedly under the guise of freedom of religion’. According to the accusers he intensely insulted their religion. ‘This remembers us of the Second World War’ said the chairman Benoit Wesly of the Jewish Community in the province of Limburg. ‘The regime of Hitler started with a banning of ritual slaughter and ended with the gas chambers’.

Graus is allowed to voice opposition to ritual slaughter but saying that the Jewish religion allows the use of torture is offensive according to Wesly.”

.

For context: 
In 2011 there was a bill stating that non-anesthetized ritual slaughter should be banned. There was a majority ruling in favour for it in the House of Representatives but it didn’t pass the Senate.

.

This somewhat pissed me off (besides the Godwin and the slippery slope) that being antitheistic towards Judaism is now equated to anti-Semitism. 

Also, the opposition of the bill said that non-anesthetized slaughter was part of their religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam were represented) + according to Wesly you can call ritual slaughter torture but you can’t add the two up and say the Jewish religion allows animal torture.

Profoundly if not, you're missing out. The psychology of religion helps us understand the dynamics of religion and how they are harmful to society which help lead us toward their solutions.

Every element of religion creates such an atmosphere that is so manipulative that it is clear why it exports large amounts of corruption. Further in my study, I started to take the anarchist view. This is because religion by its definition, is a belief in a higher authority (Thouless 2-5). This belief, with its terrifying strategies, makes government and specifically nationalism a religion. I have learned that opinions itself are dangerous and risky, which is why having an opinion on big concepts is so potentially harmful that taking the risk is almost fatal.

In psychology, the behavior of a human is dictated by what the person is influenced by, at least, most humans (Thouless 16-17). Other humans, for some reason, don't acquire that skill, and become highly unsocial, less understandable of emotions, but higher critical thinking and logical reasoning skills. These people, called anti-conformists, are where we are in, for we don't conform to the ideal nature of society. The problem with conformist is they delay the enhancement of society b/c they are highly conform to the society they live in, and are less able to adapt or even register to change. This crucial point is why conformity is a digression in society then an advantage. 

Additionally, even though we do not know the answer to these questions, we do know what is wrong. 
In mathematics, there are problem were we don't know the value of something but we what it could not have been (Ex: Many things can fit inside a box 10 ft by 10 ft, but we know many things that cannot.) [^*\[3\]*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1A9vrsw6Hw&amp;list=PL9D9336926EF60BB0&amp;feature=plcp[)


Additionally, there is much evidence to prove that religion was a by-product of reasoning and logic which helped our survival but as society is ending agriculture era and in the middle of the industrial and scientific era, religion becomes a problem to forward the progression, and therefore will halt our expansion until religion is removed. [^*\[4\]*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer) [^*\[5\]*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_revolution) [^*\[7\]*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society#Information_society)

I have also figured something that strengthens my point to anti-theism which is that religion will not slowly go away. True, the major religions today will vanish in the next century or so, but religion as in the belief will not go away so fast.[^*\[6\]*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197) That belief will not go away until government goes away. Mathematically speaking, if you look at the rate of science and the rate of government the point where science educates humanity to think for them self and learn to manage themselves is the point the belief of an higher authority, will truly end. [^*\[2\]*](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/) However, this would certainty will not occur until the next 300 years and by then we will have 200 years where society will be halted, which the last time that happened, was the Dark Ages.[^*\[8\]*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_\(historiography\))


Therefore, within this century, the best way to lessen the suffering of humanity and stop another downfall of society is to remove religion during this time. Basically, we need to eliminate those traits (the traditional, rational, affective, and natural elements) that breed religion and then terminate it immediately, for the better if our society. So we know how religion is the wrong answer to life. However, my proposal is not a philosophical but a scientific one. I have clearly shown you how the belief in higher authority is repugnant to society that is a good enough reason to prove to me that religion is not right answer to society and unless you favor strongly in individualism a live you live alone, I suggest removal of religion for true progress.

If you need to understand what those traits specifically are or want to understand the psychology of religion personally you can find some in the sources.

to a leading professor of religious studies identify 
the roots of a 3rd great religious awakening. Since that 
time, it would be hard to miss the religious fervor that has gripped, paralyed even,
the US. The all too common, ""god bless us"" and historical 
distortions that the US  is a ""Christian"" nation. 
Let's just forget Jefferson was a diest  
and removed all the ""miracles"" from his bible.[1]

Despite this assault on reality to appease the 
religiously minded, the US has survived these culture assaults
before, lets not forget the 60s counter-culture 
followed the 2nd ""great"" awakening[2], though it took almost 100 years
for culture to swing back more liberal.

So I just want to know, when will it end? Assuming this current
fervor is the 3rd in a long historical series, when can we come out
from our hiding places and have conversations about how silly
religion is, without being lampooned? Is is possible in a country
that believes in religious tolerance (and birthed Scientology), 
to ever value intellectualism over theism?

I'm still new to reddit and honestly started reading it because of the atheist posts and I've found them really enlightening (among all the memes and facebook posts). I used to think that the bible was a story that a clever man came up with in order to get people to be lawful and ""good"" by fearing hell (never having actually read it). I thought that people who believed in religion were ignorant for believing it despite evidence to the contrary but that overall it was a good thing. I now consider myself to be an atheist, considering antitheism. I have to come to realise all of the negative implications that religion has brought us. I no longer think that fearing punishment from a higher power makes you more moral than anyone else. I think that religion has become a cop-out for many people, a way of transferring responsibility for their actions onto god who ""has a plan for them."" It also appears to be at the root of many of the global issues currently going on. Hearing about what is going on around me makes me glad that I was brought up in a household that promoted my curiosity and quelled it with scientific facts.
Yesterday however I was having a discussion with my friend, who was brought up catholic, about her beliefs. She said that she believes in evolution and that the earth is 4.5 billion years old and that the bible is full of metaphors and not meant to be taken literally. The part that got me thinking was that she also believes that god has a plan for everyone and that they must figure out what that plan is. My issue with that is, by the very nature of evolution and the origin of life, humans are almost an accident. It was not planned that we would come into existence and have superior powers of deductive reasoning than other species. A chance mutation occurred that happened to be beneficial. If god has a plan for us, then does that mean he has a plan for every animal too? Even the insects and plants and bacteria that have evolved just the same as we have? I doubt that she would agree with this (although I must remember to ask her) but I thought that this could spark some intelligent discussion.

For a while, I agreed to the concept, but there was something that didn't quite make sense. I pondered about this for a while until recently I got an idea. There is a reason why we spread idea, and reject ones that are false. If we want to continue to live in this world, we need an universal community which will propose to agree on ideas rationally. The huge problem is religion. To diverse our nature in to different ideology will create large misunderstanding of each nature and propose to cripple our society. Today, there is so much diversity that we look at ourselves not humans but men,women, Americans, Arabians, Muslims, and Christians. If we want to unite the world, we have to representing ourselves differently, but similar. Sure, we will have different ideas but that is not the problem. The problem is not allowing people to debate it out and come to an agreement, we cannot tolerant other ideas until we know it is truly the right one. Religion, argues to be more united to themselves and outcast others. Therefore, we have to remove religion to become a community. Right now, all we can do is make the next generation realize that from all nations, we are humans and we demand human rights. They must come to conclusion that they must think logically with an open mind. They must realize that on the full extent, this means we have to make sure they will be able to make judgement. Additionally, we need to feed them knowledge, feed them what they need to know, not what we want to hear. If the world wants peace, it need not to tolerate others, but understand why and when we need to tolerate or not. Lets create a world we want our children to live in; let's make the community.

EDIT: Remember, I posted this to see if the idea sounds reasonable and is a good one. I'm writing a book based on one of these, so that is why I didn't give a lot of explanations or actual ways to do this since it would be pointless to if the idea is flawed.

This wll obviously be a rant against religion, so theists: brace yourselves, another attack is headed your way!

Before I start, a few things must be said.
I will be referencing holy books several times, but cannot provide you with quotes or details, for I have never even seen a bible or quran or anything alike in real life, ever.
I attended a protestant elementary school, so I have some rudimentary knowledge, but don't call me out if I screw up content. 

Fun fact: one-sixth of all American non-religious people are Redditors. 

Every holy book emphasizes the ""fact"" that their god is a kind and peace-loving person.
Then, I ask you, why is there so much misery?!
Wars are raging all over the world, and such loss of life surely wouldn't be condoned by a peaceful entity.
Also, if this so-called ""almighty"" god is so kind, why do diseases exist?
The Beubonic Plague is responsible for whiping out half the European population in the Middle Ages, and diseases like cancer, typhus and AIDS are still at large. 
If god was kind, why did he not prevent the deaths of millions?
If he is almighty, why can he not erase these diseases from existence?
And why did he create them in the first place?

Drought, famine and poverty are making life in Africa horrible beyone description.
In the Horn, 30 million people face starvation because they lack fresh water.
No water means no irrigation, and no irrigation in a desert means no fertile soil.
Those people can't grow their own food because of this, nor can they import any, for they lack the money.
Africa, and to a lesser extent South-America have been ravaged by war, diseases, floods, famine, and cannot battle them because they're waist-deep in debt to the West.
Surely any god worth his salt would give these underprivileged lands the resources to climb out of this valley. 

Even we, the ""modern"" world, aren't immune to problems.
The recession that started in 2010 hasn't been contained as of yet, and has caused problems no one could have anticipated.  
Speaking of recessions: the Wall Street crash, directly responsible for massive unemployment and starvation on a global scale. 
If an almighty entity refuses to help us out in times of need, then he must be a sadist, for an almighty god can do literally anything, that includes restoring the economy.

More proof that god is a sadist:
Adolf Hitler: 70 million dead
Joseph Stalin: 40 million dead 
Mao Zedong: 60 million dead
Tojo Hirohito: 35 million dead
Wilhelm II: 20 million dead  
Kim Il-Sung: 5 million dead
The Crusades: app. 3 million dead 

Ah, the Crusades. Yet more proof that there is no god.
The Crusades were meant to save Jerusalem from the Islam.
There were 7 crusades, yet only the first was succesfull. 
 
You believers out there will no doubt blame every problem on the devil.

Is it not true that the bible says: god cast Lucifer down because he didn't agree?
That makes God look like some kind of dictator to me.
And what exactly did Lucifer disagree with? War.
The Devil wanted to end War! And God screwed him over for that.
So I ask you: who is the real villain? 

So according to religion, the devil causes all problems, and god is unable to stop his actions.
But the books never speak of the devil as being almighty, while god is frequently adressed as such.
If that is true, then why doesn't god overrule satan's wickedness? 
Because he doesn't exist, that's why.

God is supposd to have given mankind free will. Many people don't believe in god, but jehovah, allah or nothing at all. 
Why does he condone people to kill each other over something he himself created?

Just found this and thought you all might enjoy it. Hitch was one of the more surprising Anti-theists in my opinion, given that, though his name contained an infinite amount of raunchy stigma, he was still a rather laid back, enjoyable man. He neither came from a science background, nor studied it in his education, but he accepted it, meaning you don't need to be a *type* or *kind* of person to understand the gravity reality (He-he).

1376037771.0,13,self.Antitheism,1k0ku3,"Just joined, why I'm an anti-theist (long!)",18,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/1k0ku3/just_joined_why_im_an_antitheist_long/,"Right now I'm typing this from a room somewhere in a community of ""spiritual"" believers, where I have been living for the past 8 years, (since I was a teenager) thinking I belonged to a ""spiritual"" group not something religious (as we are told.) There may or may not be a keylogger on my computer (in a paranoid state, I think I'm being watched all the time) but whatever, I care not anymore. I was raised Catholic but left the church at 16. I moved into this community because there were people who supported me for the first time in my life. I have been living a false life at the bottom of the totem-pole here (I'm not a good faker, probably borderline autistic) (I'm non-clear as the Scientologists would say) but in order to not be homeless, and to have a shower over my head, I live in a forced obedience to my masters. In truth I am grateful, because before this I was living in severely dire circumstances (I was homeless) and running from an abusive family whom I have minimal contact with.

The reason I have finally decided to not only be anti-theist but anti-spiritual is simply from my observations and experience here. It has made it so clear to me that the delusions of ""higher-powers""  and a ""better-life"" are most often used to perpetuate toxic dependencies. False promises from complete illusions. Magic shows. . .  

Many of the people who live here are very toxic individuals. People who should have been kicked out ages ago stay on because they are higher up on the chain. A lot of people on the lower rung like me are ""lifers"" and they simply cling like tics to the place. They are ""more devoted"" than I.

Many people who have lived in this community have admitted to me they also come from abuse. There are more women here than men. 

Their past and my past have been re-creating themselves in the form of the ""helpless"" and the ""savior."" Except the ""savior"" holds us all on a very tight leash at the same time that we are not safe to express our real feelings and creativity (I.e. my ""ego mind"" creating my ""problems where there is no problems"" by having doubts), and yet this is what this whole place is supposed to be ""all about."" People come from outside and are encouraged to give donations to support this place, and when that happens, they get ""motivational talks"" that are all about ""love, gratitude and surrender"" and they get special treatment. And yet, when you are talking about the people on the inside like me, its a totally different perspective. 

I had always been anti-religion, but I was fooled by the ""we're spiritual not religious"" crap. 

I happen to be female as well, and I have grown doubly, infinately tired of the language of religion as it is (even in the case of godess worship) entirely created for men by men. When our ""guru"" goes on and on about sadhu's (he really really lookes up to Indian culture, which is a very very sexist culture!) and their wonderous experiences, powers and rituals, I know he means only men and I cry inside. Only the men have power here. Men chant the goddess name and yet, they can't even take care of their own children properly. 

For example: A new swami moved in recently, and when he moved in he had a dog with him. This dog was severely neglected. It stunk, its eyes were constantly dripping water, the animal would bark furiously and pee on the floor if it were left a minute alone. After a few weeks of walking the dog myself, the dog really liked me, and anytime it found me (even when the swami was around) this creature would run to my feet and sit down. This swami also has two children from another marriage, and having met both of his boys and the mother, all the family members are also very very unwell. By unwell I mean, when THEY had the dog over, they literally let the dog shit all over the carpet and didn't clean it up. The Swami btw, got a big suite on the top floor, and the 3 family members had to share one tiny room all the way at the other end of the hall. In this tiny room, imagine dog poo stains all over the carpet that were RUBBED INTO the carpet. (Luckily I didn't have to clean it but I heard tell of it from others after they left!)
 
And yet this swami spends hours chanting in his nice double suite. It literally breaks my heart. I can't accept him as a swami, he can't even take care of his own offspring or wife, those closest too him! His wife and children were later asked to leave because the wife was a recovering alcoholic who lapsed. YET, there are worse people who still live here, with even worse drug problems.

I realize this place is a microcosm of the universe, but I'm tired of being told, ""the world out there will eat you up and spit you out, you'll die if you go out there"" if I want to leave and yet when I say something like ""you know that wasn't ok that you told me how I should be living my own spiritual journey. . . "" well I just need to ""surrender"" because this is how the world is.  

I can't argue very well logically yet. I'm still stuck here in this place with very real feelings that this is wrong for me. I know religion is not the fault of people like me who were born into it and followed it out of blind ignorance and hope. I don't hate religious people. I hate the fact that believing in a power outside of yourself makes you open to abuse. And people being people, its basically guaranteed. Religion attracts people who are suffering, thinking that it is a highway to a better perspective or life. Instead its a den of leeches and tics. Ever asking for others to help you (who aren't your parents) is guaranteed high risk scenario. Doing it when its their business to be more than just your mentor, well watch out. . . there are a lot of snake-salesmen.

I remember reading one time that there is supposed to be a 20% or more percentage of religious clerics who are secretly athiest*. Well, I'm one of them. Here's hoping that I can someday get out of here and not instantly get sniped the moment I walk out the door! 

*EDIT: I mean anti-theist. But probably athiest as well (flat out anti-paranormal). I'm sorry, my aura and my iching and my guru and my angels told me so!

**EDIT 2: Sorry if it seemed like a cry for help! I've been homeless before so I know how to handle really tough situations on my own. Like I said before, its more my hope that people read this and understand 1) realize a lot of spiritual people are coming from abuse...the more fervent their beliefs the more its a reflection of a sad reality and you can't free them until they free themselves 2) that in my direct experience, religions create false promises for people who are suffering...and the language of ""self-help"" especially in religious groups (one could say the same for HR in corporations lol), it is generally used to keep the people down not uplift them, and this may be one of the most toxic things of all. ""Gas-lighting"" is the word that comes to mind.  Because if you start actually applying yourself to the ""teachings"" of self-understanding, you begin to go in these logical circles with people as they struggle to keep in line with authority, and they will pull the rug out from every effort you make to come to your own understanding.",,False,self,t5_2qq2r,1376076732.0,,,True,t3_1k0ku3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/1k0ku3/just_joined_why_im_an_antitheist_long/,

I always vocalize my opinions about religion to her, in a mature manner. I always give her some food for thought, and it does get her thinking. But she still stands strong with Jebus. I go to church with her occasionally to make her happy. But her parents tell her she's going to hell for even being with me.

They are discussing slavery in Exodus 20/21.

The theists rebuttal is simply that they were not talking about slaves, but a servant or employee.

Now sure if the video cut out before someone mentioned this, but I wanted to scream, okay lets say they weren't slaves, but employed servants.  How does that make it okay to beat your employee.

I would have simply said to that guy, ""Okay servant, as you are to your employer, would it be okay for your employer to beat you so bad you die in 3 days?  Is that morally acceptable?""

No, in all seriousness, that was said (in proper English) as a kindly joke at some point in conversation when I was a child, and I only bring it up to underscore that we were openly, consciously atheist, overtly unappreciative of religion for the BS it peddles, which is likely how the discussion ended up on religion.

Snippets / memories from my childhood:

At age 5, steadfastly refusing to pray to god in kindergarten at lunch time, the only kid in the class to object, and being so stubborn that my parents were called after school, and backed me up, whereby I was the kid who didn't have to pray at lunch.  Which was also awkward, because it meant I wasn't participating, which made me stand out.  Later grades didn't have teachers that wanted kids to pray.  It was early 1970's Canada, not uptight about prayer in school either way as I recall.

Might have been 6 or 7, playing with some kids in the neighborhood, getting in a big argument about god, me not really knowing what the hell they were talking about, them unable to comprehend someone who didn't believe in / think about god and thought it sounded stupid and said it made no sense.  (I still don't know)

My dad seeing the Joho's coming up our long driveway, tearing off his clothes so he could answer the door butt naked.

Shaking our heads (facepalm was still an unrealized gesture) at the fool who dropped off a big load of wood to us, and was preaching about the end of the world coming on a specific date in a few months, which of course it didn't.

My Grandfather saying 'grace' at dinner: Pass the butter, pass the meat, for Christ's sake let's eat!

My Grandma giving me a rare old book to read called [The Creed of Constantine (free to read)](http://archive.org/details/creedofconstanti00tich)

Suffice it to say, religion never made any sense to me, because I had no one to pound the nonsense into my soft little head at threat of humiliation.  And suffice it to say, I have no regrets, and this world looks very different to me than it does to many.

Over the years, I've come to realize the word anti-theist is really where my feelings are, I think that's inevitable given the shit that's being peddled in this world in the guise of religion.

1354380150.0,8,self.Antitheism,143vjy,Why hate religion?,51,43,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/143vjy/why_hate_religion/,"This is my first post on reddit, I'm not sure this is where I should start off, but this is an honest question, and I'm looking for respectable, well-mannered answers. I grew up in a fundamental/traditionalist Christian household. The church I went to it also extremely traditionalists, if I had to guess I would say that a majority of the attendees believe in a literal form of the creation story in Genesis. From a young age I found it extremely difficult to believe the teachings, I pointed out discrepancies between the Bible and history, the Bible and science, etc. From the time I was in eighth grade, until now, I have been in a constant search for some sort of religious identity/contemplating a lack of. This is my second year in college, and I go to a liberal arts university, it's a VERY progressive school, and yet a religion course is still required as a gen. ed. I was going to take a basic 100 level intro to Christianity or some bs class, but I found a 300 level that satisfied two other gen ed requirements (I say gen ed, but they have a bunch of different names and categories and stuff). Point is, the class is called modern and contemporary Christian thought, and it studies the theologies presented by ""modern"" (post-1900) Christian theologians. We covered some history of Christian theology of course, points in time in which scientific discoveries caused extreme scrutiny of biblical text, which led to new Christian theologies. In a sense, and I'm sure someone will misinterpret this analogy, it's the manner in which science reinterprets its data after discovering that it presented mis-information. The real issue is that many ""Christians"" were and are stuck in their traditions, and refuse to let go of them. If a rational person looks a most modern theologies, they'll find little they can disagree with. I'm going to offer the basic ideas of a few, and I would like to see what any anti-theists have to say. Again, I just want well-mannered, educated discussion here. 

“If we wish to take scripture seriously and see it as normative, we should take it on its own terms as a model of how theology should be done, rather than as the terms in which it is done.”
""It is evident in the book Christianity worships that it is the transformative power of God's love, not a text, that is the focus of Christian faith.""
-both of these quotes are from a book by Sallie McFague (Models of God: Theology for an Ecological, Nuclear Age) these quotes are used in her argument that Christianity has become a ""book-religion"" and lost it's true path.

Another theologian, Adolf von Harnack, said that the coming of the kingdom of God isn't in anyway a physical being ""God"" coming to earth, but the acceptance of Christianity by all humans. In a sense that the moral teachings of Christianity(specifically Jesus), in their essence, are moral values that promote a general well-being of all of humanity. At that point ""God"" is on earth because Christianity defines God as all that is good, and nothing else. He also denounces Christianity for it's traditions, this isn't a direct quote, but rather from a paper I had to write this semester- ""...traditions and church structures are not only unnecessary but arguably get in the way of what it truly means to be Christian. While Harnack believed that worship is important, he also believed that the current church went about it in the complete wrong way. Once again, they needed to remove their traditions from it. Harnack makes a similar argument in regards to the ""church's authority..."" - basically he thought the modern Christian church was full of hypocritical bigots, much like a majority of atheists do today.

Another well known theologian is Immanuel Kant - to sum up his theology (it's similar to Harnack in a sense), Kant believed that biblical texts were nothing but teaching mechanisms. Many of the stories traditional Christianity claims as history, start in the same way we tell our fairy tales (in those times, in that place, etc etc, compare to long ago, in a galaxy far far away), and most of them that start in that manner offer a unique insight into the human condition, or at least some basic moral lesson to be learned. Kant also proposed universality, or, don't do anything that you can't know would be O.K. for everyone in the world to do all the time. In that sense he believed that the Bible acted as a moral compass, but each man was responsible, through his rational thought, for finding his own path to morality. 

Given the three I listed (trust me, there's plenty more), the points I would personally like to make are this. Why do some atheists despise ALL religion. I won't argue there a vast number of hypocritical ignorant assholes out there who claim to be Christian. However, when looking at Christianity from the view point of well educated theologians (Sallie McFague studied at Yale I believe.. can't remember, but it was an Ivy League, very prestigious school) how can a person be against religion in the sense they portray it. The existence of God, in any sense, is debatable, in many modern theologies he assumes many forms, and has many roles, but the point of these theologies is to create a religion that helps people maintain a high morality, and basically nothing more. When used in that manner, and without the excessive tradition, dogma, bullshit, etc how can religion be viewed as a bad thing?

Again, I have no problem denouncing hypocritical and ignorant Christian beliefs. On the same note, the church I grew up in is home to some of the nicest, most caring people I know. One lady is in her 90's, has been widowed for 50+ years, lives on something like $200 a month, and yet donates to charities regularly, works in the local soup kitchen every week, and helps to stock the local food pantry on a regular basis. So my question is this, with the information presented, what reasoning is there to be against religion, in the sense of a moral guidance and ""safety-net"" of individuals to help each other as needed? I'm not saying people NEED religion to be moral, but at the same time, it can be very helpful. Similar to workout groups who keep each other motivated.

I'm still not sure what I believe, and I'm constantly searching, in the sense of a moral guidance I can accept some forms of Christianity, as far as a ""higher power"" I would currently say that I am some form for deist as well(but that's a whole new debate in my mind).

In closing I want to leave you with the strongest argument I have ever heard for religion. It also comes from Sallie McFague, and not a direct quote, but rather my paraphrase- Science and religion should not be compared, they are not even related. Science is a wonderful thing and gives us an ability to understand the universe we live in to degrees that are almost incomprehensible, and yet it's model is irrelevant to religion. You cannot apply science to human emotions, they can't be validated through science, if science were used to validate art or poetry those things would also be ""wrong"". Art, and poetry, arguably accepted by all as some of the greatest examples of humanity, and our best expressions of ourselves, aren't scientific in any sense. In the same standard religion cannot be validated by science, and nor should it ever have to be.
She words it much more eloquently than I ever could, but I don't remember the quote and am too lazy to look it up. The point is religion should be nothing more than a way of life, in which a person betters themselves and becomes the best person they can be. Modern educated theologians don't try to argue modern science, most promote it, but they find it irrelevant to religious beliefs. They accept that the Bible isn't a history book, but rather a moral guide, written by men, for men, in a manner that made sense in the time it was written. Again back to the first quote I used - “If we wish to take scripture seriously and see it as normative, we should take it on its own terms as a model of how theology should be done, rather than as the terms in which it is done.”

I doubt many redditor's will read through this entire post, but I'm clinging to hope because I would like some answers to this. Please though, look at the argument as a whole, if you pick out one thing, misinterpret it, and try to disprove the whole argument in that manner, I'll only respond asking you to read the whole thing, or telling you you're not any better than the hypocritical traditional Christian. I am pretty open-minded, and do sincerely want to hear opinions about this. I presented an ""argument"" in the form of a question, because I want new answers and differing view points, not because I want an actual argument. I've heard traditionalist Christianities side of the story my whole life, I've heard a decent amount atheism, but sadly I'll say a lot of it was uneducated in the sense they never looked into anything themselves, but rather took another's word for it, much in the same way a traditional Christian trusts another and ends up believing the earth is 6,000 years old. I've recently heard some modern Christian view points, and it has made A LOT MORE SENSE, but I don't want to stop here, so I'm trying to pick the brains of some anti-theists, please don't disappoint. Flames, hate filled comments, general uneducated insults, people who don't explain their beliefs, etc all count as disappointing, maybe I'll just respond with disappointing to those who offer nothing of value... I wrote all this out because I'm tired of a general mockery of all religion, I feel, that no matter what you personally believe, it isn't that hard to ACTUALLY have and open mind, and see the positive aspects of religion, not just the ways in which it was corrupted. Anyway, this post is long enough. Please read, digest, try to actually understand my view point, and tell me why you agree or disagree

My username is NexusXtremeOne, but you can call me Nex.

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset, I figured that given a few years, things would return to normal and maybe be even better that ever.

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, we were fed a metanarrative. A narrative where everything was right with the world, everything would end with a happy ending, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

However, I initially submitted to r/atheism but it just got a couple of down votes which I don't really understand.  

The article is talking about universities and sports but it all applies to religious institutions too and maybe even more so.  Religious institutions have even more reason to protect themselves at the expense of the individual, many even teach that.  

To me, this is a major problem with religious institutions and one of the biggest danger.  By that I mean - making the institution more important than the individual.  

http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/0712/Sandusky-report-Penn-State-the-institution-was-more-important-than-individuals

Edit: 

It seems surprising to me that so many people do not see this as a serious problem and possibly the root of a lot of problems with religious institutions.  Look at how easily they hid child predators and other abuses within the Catholic church.  It happens in other churches too.  I went to my parents church (Reformed Church of America) about abuse I suffered as a mission child and their reaction was not to address it or investigate it, they ultimately ignored me and I did not have the courage to pursue it further.  I am too old now and it is too far in the past to do anything about, but what about current kids?

What bothered me most was that they didn't want to hear about it.  They had no interest in investigating it.  They didn't want to know who were the abusers or who were the victims.  They had no questions for me.  I initially got some sympathetic responses, followed by total silence.  After making (shaming) some friends and family email the church (I don't actually know who did, if they did, no one would discuss it with me), I was finally responded to and sent the name of a therapist in another state and I think she was going to give me discount, whoop-de-do).  The response of religious people, including my parents, is to protect the church at all costs (they call that the ""greater good"").   

Which means that abuses are routinely swept under the carpet.  So long as they continue to maintain the attitude that the religious institution is more important than the individual, abuse will not be addressed.  How many other mission kids were abused when I was?  How many kids have been abused since then?  How many are currently being abused?  

Pedophile, sadists and thieves have the perfect haven in a church.  No one is more interested in protecting the church than its own leadership.  They would much rather protect the abusers than the victims.",,False,self,t5_2qq2r,1342360525.0,,,True,t3_wjt08,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/wjt08/doesnt_this_seem_like_something_that_especially/,

Bear in mind that all the statements below are my own opinions and beliefs; they're not meant to be taken as absolute facts by any means.

THESIS: Religion, and, more broadly, any belief in the supernatural, like ghosts, etc., is actively hindering human development by keeping us selfish. It is not just foolish and illogical, it is harmful and ultimately destructive.

So, here's the explanation: Humanity has a dual nature to be both selfish and altruistic. Both traits serve evolutionary purposes. Being selfish results from the desire for self-preservation, a perfectly normal and natural aspect of life. We fear our own demise, and that's okay. Altruism also preserves life, because without it we would self-destruct as a species. We take care of each other, and that preserves our genes the same way avoiding death does.

Religion (which, in this context will always be taken to mean the broad belief in the supernatural/afterlife) emphasizes and amplifies our selfish nature. It provides solace from that fear of death we all have. But, by doing so, it de-emphasizes the importance of the very lives we seek to preserve. I saw a TV show in which a devoutly religious person outright stated, ""I know this world means nothing; it's the one that comes after it that's important."" Because religion keeps people oriented toward their own self-preservation, they are unable to truly view themselves as members of a larger group (the human race). It codifies and solidifies the notion of ""us vs. them,"" giving legitimacy to the base animal aspects of our nature. It makes it nearly impossible to rise above our instincts and act like truly civilized beings.

Altruism in this context is a fundamental sense of membership in a larger group, of being connected to other humans in such a way that it informs absolutely every aspect of life. The best way I can illustrate this is to ask you, the reader, to look at a chair. What do you see? I'd say 99.999% of respondents would reply, ""A chair."" I, however, see the end result of the efforts of dozens of people: those who harvested the trees, those who cut the trees into lumber, those who shaped the lumber into the chair's components, those who assembled the components into a chair, those who manufactured the screws that hold the chair together, those who smelted the steel that became the screws, those who mined the ores that were smelted down, those who packed the chair for shipment, those who shipped the chair to the store, those who sold me the chair, etc. Yeah, that's a long list, but it's still not complete. And that's how I see EVERYTHING in the world. It's an awe-inspiring, humbling way to view reality; it also gives me a deep sense of connection to other people. It reminds me of just how dependent upon the efforts of others my life is.

If that type of perception were the norm instead of the exception, we wouldn't have genocide, suicide bombers, prejudice, rape, child abuse, etc. The pain and distress caused by evil actions would have the weight it deserves. We would find it nearly impossible to ignore the suffering of others. We could band together to solve global problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, etc. And it's religion, and its amplification of our selfish nature, that prevents such a perception from spreading.

This is a complex idea, and were I a more organized thinker I could probably turn it into a full-fledged book. Alas, I am not. It's merely something that has been bouncing around my head for a while, but I've never really expressed it to this degree. Re-reading it, I can see there are many facets to the concept that I haven't articulated at all, but I don't want this to become an unreadable wall of text. The basic gist is still there.

Your right to operate on our land has been forfeited by your rape, torture, and murder of our children, by your refusal to change and do justice, and by your betrayal of your own faith and public trust.
Depart, Now and Forever
If you continue to operate on our land after September 18, 2011, your clergy and officials will be in a state of criminal trespass and public mischief, and will be subject to immediate arrest and detainment by our Common Law Peace Officers.

We call upon all the members of these churches to honor this Banishment Order by withdrawing their financial and material support for these criminal corporations posing as religious bodies, lest they be found guilty of complicity with these crimes.

This Banishment Order will be enforced through direct, non-violent actions by our people to peacefully occupy the church properties of these corporations, and use them to house the homeless and feed the hungry.

We invoke the Great Law of Peace and the Sovereignty of our respective Nations as we proclaim the Permanent Expulsion and Banishment from our communities of the Roman Catholic Church, Inc., the Church of England, Inc. (Anglican-Episcopalian), and the United Church of Canada, Inc.

The family has nothing to barter with. Another night with no food.

The mother prays. She cries and she prays. Through the night, into the morning, promising her life, not caring if she goes to hell, **anything** she can do for God, for whatever Being is out there, for her child to live. Her beautiful baby.

We all know the bible story, but do we understand the whys?
Why was the tree of knowledge of good and evil ever put in the garden?
Why was Eve created so weak she would choose to eat of it?
The same with Adam? If man was really created in Gods image,
then why was he not able to overcome a simple temptation to eat of 
the tree? Did God knowingly destine evil to encompass the world?
If so, how can He claim to be so perfect, holy and righteous? If the
devil was created by God, and he was perfect before his fall, then
why wouldn't or couldn't God have prevented his fall (and mans) 
by his great wisdom?

There is a simple answer, but few may understand it. { the answer 
is not ,of course, as simple as if God is really not all powerful and
 perfect; or that He doesn't really exist )

When I was 4 or 5 years old, I asked my mother..
   .""Why did God make some men evil?""
The first clues to answer the questions for me came from certain 
scriptures. In Gen 3:22 "" ..man has become as one of us..""  I have
to conclude that the ability of man to have true faith, hope, love, and really
have freedom with creativity and choice he must have a knowledge
of good and evil. If you were like an assimilated robot, android, or
even a computer, could you really know, understand, or ever have 
the real ability to have faith, hope and love? In Rom 8:20    Paul
explains that the creature, ( man ), was subject to vanity, not
willingly, but by reason and in hope that the creature will
be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
liberty of the children of God. 

Thus although man was created in Gods image, he did not really become nearly  
like God until after his fall and his redemption. If you were a robot, wether you 
be evil or good, it would be by chance, so you should not be personally judged, because 
you don't have discernment of good and evil. If you can not agree to some absolute 
truths, then your simple minded concept of basing morality on reason alone is relativistic and has
blinded you to what  really is reality, because you do not have enough logical bases for your
imaginations There is a certain level of maturity that may need to be reached before you can
effectively judge between all good and evil? In Heb 5:14 the author writes..."".But strong meat
belongs to them that are full of age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised
to discern both good evil."".


So then, although God is righteous and holy, He may purpose some evil to exist, but not willingly.
You must understand the value of the spiritual goes beyond all material existence. So all the evil
that God allows is part of a process to create a greater destiny for man. In Heb 2:8
the author writes ""..You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in
subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things
put under him."" Thus there is process not yet completed.

1)The universe is running down, and something that is running down must have started at some point. The second law of thermodynamics states that the universe is running out of usable energy and that implies that if it was to be eternal we would already have run out of it.

2)The universe is expanding. This was confirmed through the Hubble telescope many years ago, and it is interesting to note that the universe is expanding from a single point, meaning the entire universe could be contracted back into a single point. Also, note that the universe is not expanding into space, but space itself is expanding.

3)The radiation echo was discovered by Bell Labs scientists in 1965. What is it? It is the heat afterglow from the Big Bang. Its discovery dealt a death blow to any theory of the universe being in a steady state because it shows instead that the most plausible theory is that universe exploded. With plausible I mean almost 100% assured.

4)Galaxy Seeds. Scientists believe that, if the Big Bang is true (first, there was nothing, then, BANG, something came into being), then temperature “ripples” should exist in space, and it would be these ripples that enabled matter to collect into galaxies. To discover whether these ripples exist, the Cosmic Background Explorer – COBE – was launched in 1989 to find them, with the findings being released in 1992. What COBE found was perfect/precise ripples that, sure enough, enable galaxies to form. So critical and spectacular was this finding that the NASA lead for COBE, said, “If you’re religious, it’s like looking at God.”

    No, they’re not. There are no calls for slavery, rape or murder in the atheist holy book.

    Atheists are most often called ‘militant’ when they passionately defend reason and advocate critical thinking. The bar theists set for perceived atheist hostility appears to be any atheist simply voicing an opinion in dissent of religious belief. In contrast, the bar atheists set for perceived theistic hostility is any form of religiously motivated violence or oppression.

    Atheism does not preclude someone from being argumentative or insensitive; those things are simply seen as being preferable to killing one another over an imaginary friend.

    A ‘militant’ atheist will debate in a University theater or appeal for the separation of religion and government. A militant theist will kill doctors, stone women to death, incite religious war, restrict sexual and gender equality and convince children they are flawed and worthless – all under the instruction of their imagined ‘god’ or holy book.

    It can be argued that there is no such thing as a ‘militant’ atheist, that the term is itself a misnomer, because there is simply no ideology or philosophy in atheism to be militant about. If an atheist is someone who lacks belief in gods, then a ‘militant’ atheist is apparently someone who passionately lacks a belief in gods. All other possible beliefs and ideologies – including the desire to oppress theism – come from outside atheism. This is in contrast to religious belief, which often includes a set of laws and commandments purportedly derived from a supernatural source which one can actually be ‘militant’ about.

    Note: ‘Militant’ atheism is most often confused with gosateizm (state atheism), which was based on the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. It was this ideology which was responsible for the oppression and murder of theists under several 20th century communist regimes. Atheism is simply a lack of belief in gods with no inherit moral, political or philosophical baggage..

    “I’m sorry if my insensitivity towards your beliefs offends you. But guess what – your religious wars, jihads, crusades, inquisitions, censoring of free speech, brainwashing of children, forcing girls into underage marriages, female genital mutilation, stoning, pederasty, homophobia and rejection of science and reason offend me. So I guess we’re even.” – Anonymous

    Where is god? (Interjection)

    Argument from non-belief.

    Why is it now that we have developed rational inquiry we hear only a deafening silence from a god who once supposedly engaged regularly in human affairs? Why does god not simply speak to us or appear before us as he supposedly used to? Why are we the losers in the dice roll of time? If a god places such a high value on us worshiping and believing then why not simply make its existence obvious to us?

    If one accepts the prevailing scientific understanding of the development of the universe, but also believes in one of the major religions, then presumably a god sat idle for 13.7 billion years – waiting as the galaxies, stars and planets formed. Then it watched with complete and utter indifference as modern Homo Sapians evolved, struggled and died for a further 100,000 years. Finally, a few thousand years ago, this god suddenly decided to reveal itself to several people in the most primitive, illiterate and remote portions of humanity in a completely unverifiable way – and then simply disappeared.

    If Jesus is God then presumably he is omniscient. If this is true, then when he allowed himself to be sacrificed, didn’t he do this with the knowledge that he was immortal? If so, then how exactly was it a sacrifice for him? What did he sacrifice?

    “If Jesus is the son of god, but also god himself, then he supposedly sacrificed himself to himself to save what he created from himself. He also, therefore, prayed to himself and begged himself not to require himself be crucified in order to appease himself and save the world from the wrath of himself.” – Anonymous
    Jesus was wholly good and moral.

    Assuming the figure even existed, this position is incorrect.

    “There’s no hell mentioned in the Old Testament. The punishment of the dead is not specified there. It’s only with gentle Jesus, meek and mild, that the idea of eternal torture for minor transgressions is introduced.” – Christopher Hitchens
    Atheists are close-minded.

    Being open-minded does not mean accepting claims outright, it means demonstrating the willingness to consider new ones. An open-minded person is receptive to new ideas, opinions and arguments and wants to discover their real truth-value before accepting them. Atheists are generally very open-minded.

    Unjustified belief in the supernatural does not automatically make someone open-minded and, conversely, disbelief (pending further evidence) does not automatically make someone close-minded.

    Atheists simply do not usually exhibit gullibility or credulity. They maintain a standard of evidence proportional to the extraordinary nature of certain claims. They are usually open to the idea of god, but so far unconvinced by any evidence or argument put forward to support it.

    “A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence” – David Hume
    Atheism leads to a worse society.

    Atheism and secularism correlate highly with the well-being of individuals and societies by almost every possible measure.

    Atheism is correlated with better scientific literacy, lower poverty rates, higher literacy rates, higher average incomes, less violence, lower divorce rates, lower teen pregnancy rates, lower STD infection rates, lower crime rates and lower homicide rates.

    Pascal’s Wager does not actually argue in support of the existence of a god, rather, it simply attempts to coerce insincere worship. There are several issues with this approach:
        Multiple inconsistent and contradictory revelations (Which god/hell?)
        Hell is incompatible with an omni-benevolent god.
        A god could reward reasoning/skepticism.
        An omniscient god would see through feigned belief as a result of coercion.
        If a god wanted everyone to believe and knew exactly what was needed to convince people, then why are there atheists at all? Is god unable to prevent transgression of his will?
        Infallible foreknowledge is incompatible with free will (Are atheists predestined for hell?)
        Most people adhere to the religion they were born into, they have not examined all other religions.
        What is the fate of the unlearned? What happens to people who have not encountered the specific religion in which hell is an issue.

    “Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.” — Anonymous

    “We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes.” – Gene Roddenberry

    I want to go to heaven.

    Argument from wishful thinking. The primary psychological role of traditional religion is deathist rationalization, that is, rationalizing the tragedy of death as a good thing to alleviate the anxiety of mortality.

    See also: Nobody can get into heaven, Hitchens on Life and Death (a must watch) Dawkins – We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones (a must watch).

    “I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking. The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there’s little good evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.” – Carl Sagan

    “I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” - Mark Twain
    I want to believe in God OR I just have faith.

    There is a truth and reality independent of our desires. Faith simply reinforces your belief in what you would like to be true, rather than what really is.

    In order to better under understand this reality and discover the truth we must look for evidence outside ourselves.

    Faith isn’t a virtue; it is the glorification of voluntary ignorance.

    “Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements – the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life – weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be today.” – Lawrence Krauss
    Believers are persecuted by atheists.

    Blue Laws. Anti-atheist laws. Discrimination against atheists. The written penalty for apostasy in most religions is death.

    Believers claim the victim and imply that non-theists gang up on them, or rally against them. No, atheists just look at believers the same way they might look at someone who claims the Earth is flat, or that the Earth is the center of the universe: delusional.

    The bar theists set for perceived atheist hostility appears to be anyone simply voicing a dissenting opinion or mentioning an inclination towards non-belief. Claiming ‘persecution’ is simply a deflection for theists who are unwilling or unable to deal with open criticism.

    When Atheists aren’t considered the least trustworthy group and comprise more than 70% of the population, then we’ll talk about persecution.

    Why can’t atheists just leave theists alone?
        Because religion has been, and continues to be, responsible for countless horrors throughout human history. See also: Religiously motivated animosity, violence and oppression and discrimination.
        For all the problems we face as a society, many theists choose not only to do nothing to help, but actually engage in sabotage by actively preventing solutions from being instigated, usually by supporting irrational political positions eg. stem-cell research, contraception, women’s rights, sexual equality and even global warming.
        Because belief in a god taps into mankind’s natural tendency to defer moral decision making to authority figures (including priests, prophets, holy books, popes, ayatollahs and imams). Acting out ‘God’s plan’ or ‘God’s will’ is a sure-fire way to absolve one’s-self of responsibility for one’s actions. 
        Because as a functional member of society it benefits everyone if your decision making process is founded on evidence and reason, not on superstition. Faith isn’t a virtue; it is the glorification of voluntary ignorance.
        Because religious superstition erects an absolute monarchy in a person’s mind. It teaches them to be satisfied with with not understanding the world and represents a surrendering to ignorance under the pretension of ‘divine knowledge’. Many of the greatest thinkers in human history have been repressed, sometimes forcefully, by those with faith. It is not skeptics or explorers but fanatics and ideologues who menace decency and progress. See also: Hypatia, Galileo Galilei, Giordano Bruno, The relationship between science and religion.
Note: The common theist response “Those people aren’t really [insert religion]” is an example of the No True Scotsman fallacy. If all the Christians who have called other Christians ‘not really a Christian’ were to vanish, there’d be no Christians left.

    “Men never commit evil so fully and joyfully as when they do it for religious convictions.” – Blaise Pascal

    An ad hominem deflection which demonstrates a failure to understand that atheism is simply a lack of belief in god(s), with no inherit moral, political or philosophical baggage, and thus no line can be drawn from it to the aforementioned ideologies. In the same vein democracy could be called atheistic. See also: Association fallacy, appeal to emotion and irrelevant thesis.

    Hitler was religious and publicly decried atheism. See also: Nazism and Religion, Reductio ad Hitlerum.

    Stalinism and Communism exercised gosateizm (state atheism) based on the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. Atheism was a means to an end, not a cause. See also: Soviet Union and Religion.

    Social Darwinism and Eugenics supplant actual natural selection with an nonobjective personal perception of ‘fitness’. They are based on bad biology (genetic variability is actually very important for a species) and are completely independent of atheism.

Note: Religion inspires theocracy.

    See also: Early Critics of Eugenics were biologists, Naturalistic Fallacy, Evolution and Philosophy, Talkorigins: Hitler, Stalin, Social Darwinism.

    “We were convinced that the people need and require this faith. We have therefore undertaken the fight against the atheistic movement, and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations: we have stamped it out.” – Adolf Hitler

    Catholic priests performing a Nazi salute.
    Belief gives life meaning/purpose OR Atheism is nihilistic.

    The question of life’s meaning and purpose is made no less important to an individual by not believing in a god. However, instead of asking “What is the meaning of life?” (which is begging the question) an atheist might ask “What meaning, if any, can I give to my life?”.

    Most things in life are worth doing for their own sake, they do not require an existential reason. Satisfying curiosity, experiencing love and friendship, acting charitably, delighting our senses and achieving personal goals all provide an inherit sense of gratification and purpose. Conversely, religion deprives life of any personal meaning by turning it into a form of serfdom, in which our only goal is to appease the whims of a supposed creator and follow its ‘plan’. Any impetus to seek knowledge and explore is removed because all the supposed ‘answers’ are provided.

    Beyond simple biological imperatives life’s purpose is what we make it and nihilism is simply one of many possible approaches. For example, Naturalism would suggest that one’s purpose is to ‘foster an environment in which the species can survive, either by passing on genes or memes’. Humanism suggests it is to ‘promote human flourishing’. Post-modernism suggests it is to ‘create complex structures and interactions for the purpose of joy and understanding’. Buddhism, which is fully compatible with atheism, suggests it is to “focus on the human potential to overcome suffering and achieve peacefulness”.

    Perspective is important, within each of our trillion cells we carry a genetic heritage, unbroken, stretching back over 4 billion years.

    The universe, in it’s silent dwarfing beauty, may not care about human life, but we do and our brief improbable time here may best be spent experiencing it’s wonders together, not in indentured servitude to an imaginary celestial dictator.

    See also: Richard Feynman on science and purpose [shorter] (a must watch), Dawkins – We are going to die… and we are the lucky ones (a must watch), A Reassuring Fable by Carl Sagan.

    “If nothing we do matters, then all that matters is what we do.” – Joss Whedon

    “The significance of our lives and our fragile planet is determined only by our own wisdom and courage. We are the custodians of life’s meaning. We long for a Parent to care for us, to forgive us our errors, to save us from our childish mistakes. But knowledge is preferable to ignorance. Better by far to embrace the hard truth than a reassuring fable. If we crave some cosmic purpose, then let us find ourselves a worthy goal.” – Carl Sagan
    Science keeps changing, it isn’t reliable.

    The suggestion that science is unreliable because it changes is akin to believing new maps are unreliable because cartography is improving.

    Science has demonstrably produced the most accurate and reliable models of the universe that mankind has ever known and it is upon those models that all modern technology, medicine and industry are based. Science only appears to be erratic because of sensationalist reporting in the popular media.

    Science keeps changing because the tools used to perform science keep improving. When the universe of available evidence changes, scientific theories must be re-evaluated. There are no absolute truths in science; all laws, theories and conclusions can become obsolete if they are found in contradiction with new evidence. However, a theory in science is the highest honor any scientific principle can obtain, for they comprise all the evidence, laws and models relevant to a phenomena. Theories are rarely proven incorrect and are usually refined on a time-scale measured in centuries.

    The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, intuition, and creativity. It is an ongoing cycle, constantly developing more useful, accurate and comprehensive models and methods, but not necessarily discarding old ones. For example, when Einstein developed the General and Special Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton’s Principia. On the contrary, if the astronomically large, vanishingly small and extremely fast are removed from Einstein’s theories — phenomena Newton could not have observed — Newton’s equations are what remain. Einstein’s theories are simply expansions and refinements of Newton’s theories and thus increase our confidence in Newton’s work while providing a deeper understanding. The very same relationship applies to Classical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics, and to Evolution and Genetics.

    Science is an exercise in falsifiability. Unlike religious dogma, which presumes the truth, the scientific method is a self correcting process, an ever sharpening blade.  The models used by science to explain observations and make predictions are simply the ‘most correct’ at the time. The greatest skepticism should always be reserved for inflexible positions whose proponents insist that they and their assertions are above question and examination.

Well here you are. Not a lot happens here, but what does happen seems good.

What I regard as hypocrisy is how atheists don't want to take the final step away from religion. I haven't celebrated christmas for 9 years now, and I boycott everything else that has to do with religious festivities. I don't give gifts and I don't accept them. Gifts are for nice people when they've earned them, not when the calendar says they're entitled to them. Instead I go out with my friend to get hammered on christmas eve. ""Then you still celebrate it in your own way LOL"". Following that logic, I celebrate christmas 30 times a year. Trust me, I really don't. I don't believe in it, I don't want to celebrate it - and I certainly don't want to entertain the religious folks' idea that they're giving me anything. So after explaining this to people, I often get the ""but you still like getting time off, don't you?"" followed by a shit-eating grin of ""I've got you!"". Having time off at the end of the year has to be tied to religion? Nice try, asshole. No summer vacation for you.

Anyway, this was kind of random and on-the-go, but I ask you to think about your choices if you still celebrate anything tied to religion. How about celebrating Darwin's birthday instead?

( I assume you mean about god) What do you think? (I'm going to combine this question with the one above it) Have you studied other books?

First, I want to talk about the burden of proof. The theists are the ones that are burdened with the proof of Gods existence. For example, if you accuse someone of killing their wife, then you would have to provide evidence. You cannot require the husband to give evidence to prove that he did not kill his wife, that burden of proof is on the accuser. In the same way, everyone is born an atheist and has no religious beliefs. Then religious people make the claim that God exists and then the child has to make a choice. IN the same way, theists have to provide evidence for the existence of God. And there is no proof of God existence, so the claim that theists make about God is invalid. For this reason, no one can ask someone to provide ""proof that god does not exist"" because then would we also have to provide proof that unicorns don't exist? No, first there has to be substantial evidence that God does exist before we go that way.

The reason I have these questions is because I see no proof in the existence of God. In the same way, I do not need to worry about unicorns or monsters when there is no proof for their existence. In the same way, the only thing that says God exists is in the Holy Quran. But what credibility does the Quran have? Only the Quran says how accurate it is but that isnt very credible. Say I had written on a napkin ""The napkin religion is true, because it says so right here on this napkin"". That isnt very credible but that is essentially what the Quran is doing. The quran is saying, ""I'm right because I said so"". If someone published a scientific article about a new discovery and the only proof that they give of this discovery is ""Because I said it was true in the article"" no one would give it another glance. Why do religious people go to their holy books when they are just as invalid? So my feelings about God existing are the same feelings I have with unicorns and fairies. There is no proof of their existence, so why should I believe them? I am searching for the answer, but even a whole book made for the existence of god (""Our God"") I could find very major flaws in all of his arguments. Even being in a very high position on the religious ladder, Hadrat Mirza Bashir Ahmad could not make coherent points.

And yes, I have read probably two islamic books every week while reading the quran every two or three weeks since I got to college. I read a different Quran everytime also. The reason I do this is because I am trying to get more knowledge about Islam. However, my biggest problem here is that I NEED to read more books. You may be confused as to why that is a problem. Islam teaches us that the Quran is the perfect book and you will not need another book to go about your lives with. Why do people insist everyone read many many more books and the Quran with commentary? That means you are adding to the words of God and the words of God are not sufficient. If you need more than the Quran than it isnt the only book you need and isnt the perfect book. Then muslims might argue that the Quran has many interpretations and you need more books to understand what the Quran says. But if the Quran is a perfect book, then how is it even OPEN to interpretation? In other words, how would anyone mistake the words of God for something else if the book is indeed perfect? All of that proves that the Quran isnt perfect. By that conclusion you come to verse:

[54:18] And indeed We have made the Qur’an easy to understand and to remember. But is there anyone who would receive admonition?

This also not just goes into Arabic. The second line uses the word ""anyone"". So whether you speak english, urdu, arbabic or hindu, the Quran and the word of God should be easy to understand. We know now that that particular verse is incorrect because apparently the Quran isn't easy to understand. Then what else might be wrong in the Quran? If the Quran is perfect and easy to understand for everyone, then why are there questions about the Quran? Why do we need commentaries?



USMAN:

Good to hear from you. Hope you are doing well. These are good questions (assuming they are in good faith in an attempt to learn) and we should definitely engage them.
First of all I think we have to address the scope of the problem. I think we have to acknowledge that there is no way to absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, prove the existence of god. If it were possible to do this, then there would be no one who would need convincing. There are many things that are very much suggested like man made climate change but because there is no one test for it, people can dispute it. So all we can do is provide convincing evidence that very strongly indicates the existence of a superior being and take people to that point but the rest is up to them. I think we have to make a distinction between the arguments for the existence of god and the arguments for the veracity of the Quran. We can look at the existence of god with many different arguments - from philosophy (ontologic argument), biology, physics (physics of immortality by tippler).

Richard Dawkins and others have argued that natural selection explains evolution completely but others point to irreducibly complex systems (such as the clotting cascade) that cannot be explained by natural selection. I think the symmetry of the universe is too elegant to be a random phenomenon. Mathematics is said to be the language of the universe and if theory is not elegant, it is often felt to be likely wrong - this is why Einstein said god does not play dice with the universe. I can give you additional resources to read if you want to explore these issues further.

As far as the questions about the Quran go, I am not sure where is he is getting his information. No one has ever said that it is the only book you need. Don't get caught is argument which is only partially correct in its assumption - yes we believe to be a perfect book but not that it's the only book needed. Advances in science, mathematics, physics are all independent of the Quran. However it is the moral teaching and the proof of revelation that is perfected in the Quran. Your friend in making a strawman argument - stating incorrectly that we believe a feeble idea that he can then knock down. Khalifa Rabia's book ""Revelation, rationality"" is a an excellent work not because it introduces new arguments but because it shows how the verses in the Quran are applicable to science and predicted events - it offers logical arguments showing the truth of the Quran. As far as ""anyone"" being able to understand it, the phrase ""men of understanding"" is often used to describe those who take heed- this person's arguments strike me as superficial - ask him to be more specific in his critique.

There is much more to say but let's start here.



ASAD:


Hope all is well with you at Pitt. I see that you are keeping yourself busy, mentally. As Usman bhai rightly pointed out the questions you raise are very important. One must get satisfactory answers to them, for they are the very foundation of religion and belief. This question has been asked by man of all ages and still eludes man of the 21st century.

This quest of yours could take some time until you are fully convinced and believe in a God. You are very intelligent in your reasoning and logical skills but just keep an open mind as we proceed with this endeavor. Keep searching and if you are sincere in your desire - you will attain it. If you are just trying to play an intellectual game and outsmart the 'ignorant' religious thinkers then it will be a difficult journey.
Let us begin with broadly defining what is meant by God. Let us assume God does exist. What is He or Who is He? I attribute God to be a CONSCIOUS BEING. Would you agree with that assessment? What does the word God represent to you?

What kind of proof would convince you that there might be a God? Are you looking for some scientific proof, some miraculous event, something supernatural, something tangible...? I would try to address these general principles first before getting into the Holy Quran and what it says. The Holy Quran itself is a great proof of the existence of God, but NOT because it says so. This could be a discussion in itself at some other time.
One suggestion I would make for you, in addition to the intellectual journey, is to ask God Himself. This may seem like a strange request, but please give it a try. What have you got to lose? Every night before you go to sleep, the very last thing you should do is ask Allah or God: People tell me that there is a God. He is the Master of the Universe, Creator of everything, the all Supreme Being. O God, I am in search of You. If You exist help me find You and lead me to You. Provide for me some proof that I know You exist.

Do this simple 15 second exercise each night, pondering over these words - feel free to substitute your own.

Hitchens only devoted one chapter of his book to Eastern beliefs where he discusses how Buddhism was used to convince members of Hirohito's army to commit suicide attacks etc and Dawkins book didn't really have any criticism of eastern belief besides saying that all supernatural belief is wrong.

I have a few issues I've found with Eastern Belief in my short study of it: 1. It teaches you to not trust rational thought, that feelings and perception are more important than the truth and that the truth isn't even a real thing. Mindlessness is one of the best attributes one can have, the highest of aspirations is to be able to sit for hours and literally think about nothing. 2. It promotes belief in the supernatural, mainly in harmful things like holistic medicine, being able to pray and meditate sickness away, using herbal remedies that do nothing, etc
3. It has been used to justify wars, uphold the divine right of kings (no one elected the Dalia Lama, he is a king by divine right) and push many to kill and die in the name of their beliefs. There are passages in the Vedas that celebrate the killing of atheists and commands one to kill the atheists they meet and see it as a good things. 4. People who follow Eastern beliefs use all the same defenses as Western religion ""No one takes that literally anymore"" ""We are a faith of peace, those who kill others or themselves are just extreme examples"" ""Isn't it arrogant to think science has all the answers"" ""we provide something people need to remain happy and stable"" etc.

I've thought of writing my own criticism of eastern belief but I decided to come here and see if someone smarter and more experienced that me has already done it.

Five things:

1. I apologize for not keeping things up to date and staying in better touch. Being new prevents me from communicating at a decent pace, even with my email confirmed. Also, there are times when I try to have a life outside the net. Take heart then, in the knowledge that I am seldom successful. ;)

2. The first plan of NexGen_Alliance was to be private and selective in who would submit posts, participate, etc. That plan is no longer feasible if the Alliance os to grow at a decent pace or gain the attention of those who might be interested. Hence, the reddit is now public. Soon, I will try to obtain the assistance of /pimpmyreddit and other such communities.

3. I come with this message bearing gifts. These texts will provide us with a starting point from which to brainstorm:

* https://rapidshare.com/files/291702503/BeautifulTrouble.pdf
* https://rapidshare.com/files/913044070/re-imaginingChange.pdf

4. A user by the name of keskiyonaurinko submited an excellent idea of setting up a kind of sidebar directory like /r/shitredditsays and its subreddits have. I will be in contact with /reddithax to figure out how to do it. If there are any other suggestions for the sidebar, such an inspirational description of the reddit, I am more than happy to hear them.

5. It has been made very clear to me that we need some kind of plan of action to effect change in the world. However, before we can quantify a plan, we must first quantify our goals. And before we can quantify our goals, we must quantify our concerns. We must number and itemize those things which is tugging at our heartstrings and compels us to join up. IMHO, we must focus our crosshairs on the following things:

* The idea that everything is somebody else's problem. ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_Else%27s_Problem#Psychology))
* Learned helplessness ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness))
* Cultural Hedgemony ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony))
* Instrumental rationality ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_rationality))
* Repressive desublimation ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressive_desublimation))
* Capture bonding ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome))
* The lack of fully mutual knowledge ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_knowledge_(logic)))
* Enforced dependency (A term sociologists use for the creation of a class or group of people who are forced to rely on another more powerful class or group for the essentials of life.)
* Reductionism in Education
* The Baroque Mentality (A mindset characterized by a focus on eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details)

In addition, it is my request that each reddit who recieves this post quantify their concerns in the comments. This post will also be on /r/NexGen_Alliance and people are invited to post their comments there also.

""dissent"" with memefication

Due to the selective pressure placed on the memetic populations of the the species ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum*** by Edwards v. Aguillard, the meme of creationism, or cretinism as it is referred to in the Scientific community, was forced to adapt to its more intellectually honest memevironment after the verdict. This resulted in a textbook example of punctuated equilibrium and directional selection within the ***Fundius bullshitus creationsimum*** species. 

Memes of ***Fundius bullshitus creationsimum*** that were particularly brown with discernible pieces of hay sticking out of its surface were quickly destroyed by the contagious predatory memes produced by the verdict Edwards v. Aguillard due to its obvious nature. This resulted in a massive directional selection in which only the more camouflaged members of ***Fundius bullshitus creationsimum*** were able to survive. This segment of the memetic population only represented about 0.0001% of the original population of ***Fundius bullshitus creationsimum***.

 This sub species of memes had been forced to adapt to a much less fertile environment, known as Apologia. In Apologia, the voracious predatory meme ***Scientismum rex*** predated upon more obvious members of the genus ***Fundius bullshitus***, resulting in directional selection to a less obvious appearance. This subspecies, which has been named ***Fundius bullshitus pseudo intellectualis inertibus*** and ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum fucus*** quickly spread into the memetic niches left after the mass extinction of ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum***. During this transitional phase of its evolution, this memetic population became known colloquially as **Crintelligent Designism**.

This population rapidly multiplied and enjoyed adaptive radiation until a second mass extinction event, known as Kitzmiller v. Dover. After significant selective meme-ing and memetic engineering, The Bullcovery Group had produced a particularly virulent strain of  ***Fundius bullshitus pseudo intellectualis inertibus***, that was almost undetectable to ***Scientismum rex*** when placed in Apologia. However, the Bullcovery Group had not counted on the use of sophisticated bologna detection devices, also know as scientifically educated brains, on scrutinizing their new meme. This let to its detection by ***Scientismum rex*** and subsequent predation. ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum fucus*** is now extinct in the wild and can only be found in special meme parks like Conservapedia and in habitats that are particularly free from free thought and reason, like the mind of an evangelical fundy.

**Tl;DR** ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum fucus*** is a critically endangered species.

It incorporates the popular red Atheist *A* into the Command and Conquer symbol for the Brotherhood of Nod. This may seem a little cliche, but the symbolism of the Biblical Nod actually fits us quite well. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Nod), the land of Nod is the place (mythical place of course) that Cain fled to after he slew Abel.He fled to get away from being cursed by God, which is something I think we can all identify with. The term ""nod"" is apparently the root of the Hebrew verb ""to wander."" The term nod itself has come to be identified from wandering away from God, which is what most Atheists and Antitheists have done. 

This is just a first draft. I am an amateur and I used freeware to make the logo. If any of you have suggestions or have just plain better ideas please describe them below.

1336717247.0,0,self.Antitheism,thtki,Religious Catalysts of the Great War (WWI+WWII) [xpost from r/Atheism],4,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/thtki/religious_catalysts_of_the_great_war_wwiwwii/,"If you watch educational television, have learned or are learning about world history in a public school or hear tales about the great war from a populist standpoint, you probably know about Adolf Hitler and the atrocities he had committed during his reign as the undisputed ruler of Germany.

However, in response to the common stories I am given, I feel that it is very important to circulate some less known information about why things got so out of hand, and why they were allowed to do so.

Before Hitler, before the first world war, Germany was technically the most advanced society in the world. They had the strongest economy, were the most advanced in terms of industrialization and had a great value for culture and the arts.

The culmination of their success was due to the efforts of one Otto von Bismarck. If you are unfamiliar with the name, the most important thing I can think to tell you about this man is that he is considered the father of ""Realpolitik"".

Realpolitik is the concept of applying logic to politics in order to understand the true motivations and probabilities of the actions taken by those around you (in a nutshell).

Bismarck was able to use this strategy to guarantee favorable claims of land and power over countries such as France and Russia.

Enter our first great religious catalyst:

The one major flaw to Bismarck's ideology was that he was an undying Royalist, and therefore blindly loyal to the Kingdom of Prussia. By the twilight of his career he was removed from power by a young, brash ruler; King Wilhelm II.

As is the doctrine of royal power, Wilhelm II thought himself chosen by God to rule the world, and in the support of the Austrian-Hungarian kingdom chose to wage a war that would jeopardize all which Bismarck and worked to accomplish.

Key differences;

Logic - Bismarck had tactfully chosen his battles and desired to secure a German nation which would develop on it's own as the world watched.

Divinity - Wilhelm figured angels would come down to help with the smiting.

After the great war had subsided, the rest of the world capitalized on the fear everyone was experiencing, and stripped Germany of it's power. Not only did they disband Germany's entire military force, but they went a step further and took away virtually every possible civilian method Germany had that would ensure economic growth and stability (ex- entire merchant fleet = ZERO foreign trade).

In the wake of these actions, the German people suffered what is known as Hyperinflation; For every $1 from the United States, a German would have to trade 4,000,000,000,000 marks.

Not only did this worsen living conditions, it set the German people into a situation that would force self destruction; a great deal of the nation had literally fallen from grace and had little to no understanding of how to survive in their current economic climate. If you are currently well off, or at least consider yourself to be in the middle class, imagine actually having to load an entire wheelbarrow with you hard earned savings in order to afford a single loaf of bread for your family.

Enter catalyst number 2:

Before they were known as the ""Nazi scourge"", the National Socialist German Workers Party -led by Adolf Hitler- was hard at work assuring the desperate German populous that they had the answers that would end the countries great suffrage.

For most Germans, the life they had become accustomed to had become a prelude to a future that was so horrific, they were willing to compromise their own logic in return for a false sense of security; they would believe anyone who seemed to be in a position to change their outcome, and Hitler was the most convincing man for the job.

With his wildly outlandish claims having greater sway over an irrational country than those who preached steady recovery, many of the German people were quickly convinced that Hitler's power was as divine as he had claimed; The solidarity of a religiously fanatical minority held control over a logically indifferent majority.

A persons ability to cultivate logic and practice reason is directly affected by the presence of reasonable circumstance in their everyday life. Religious zealousness is most effective and specifically aimed towards the ignorant, fearful, desperate and downtrodden.

We must give hope where the concept of prosperity is so foreign that faith has become an acceptable substitute.

    Science is an enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. The main role of observation and experimentation in science is to criticize and refute existing theories. Scientific knowledge is created by asking questions and testing conjectures/hypotheses against reality.

    Faith is absolute trust or confidence in a belief. Scientific theories are, however, inherently falsifiable – meaning they can be proven wrong. No claims of absolute truth are believed or need to be taken ‘on faith’ in science because none are made. True scientists say, “We are aware that our theories and conclusions are not perfect, just the best fit for available evidence”.

    Scientific knowledge is a form of justified belief grounded in empirical evidence and the demonstrable reliability of the scientific method. Faith is an unjustified belief based on fantasy, superstition and wishful thinking.

    Science converges on the truth via questioning. It’s solutions and explanations do not differ between nations or cultures because they can be tested by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Whatever knowledge science produces is valid throughout the world and the universe. Religion, on the other hand, diverges into a myriad of forms and beliefs.

    If all knowledge of science was lost, someone could figure it out again. What is true remains true, and anyone could discover that truth again using the same method that revealed it in the first place. Conversely, if every trace of religion were wiped out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created in exactly the same way again.

    Science is the pursuit of truth, not the presumption of it.

    See also: The faith cake (a must watch), Is Science a Religion?, Skewed views of science, If science worked like religion – Dawkins (a must watch).

    If God is the Potter, who are we to say what he does with his clay?

    Why would a perfect potter create an imperfect mold, order it to be perfect and then judge it based on the imperfections he gave it?

    Theistic arguments which assume god’s existence are logically valid.

    Simply because a logically valid argument can be constructed does not imply a true premise or true conclusion.

    All cups are green.
    Socrates is a cup.
    Therefore, Socrates is green.

    Although the above argument is logically valid, neither its premise nor conclusion are actually true. An argument is only sound if it is valid and its premise and conclusions are true.

    Assuming god exists, arguments against theist claims are illogical/fallacious.

    Things can exist in different contexts: God exists, in the sense that God is an idea that people have. Atheists can comment perfectly fine on the implications of belief and on god as a character without being required to believe in god.

    When atheists agree with the premise of god’s existence for the purpose of  showing the absurdity of a theistic argument, they may still question conclusions about god’s nature by debating the correctness of the inference. For example:

    God exists.
    Therefore, you should worship god.

    Simply because god may exist, does imply said god requires worship. In fact, a  perfect god should, by definition, require nothing. This is known as a non sequitur.

    “There is nothing more telling of a person’s fundamental lack of perspective and humility than an insistence that if they cannot reconcile their beliefs with reality, then reality itself must be wrong.” – Anonymous
    Atheists presuppose god’s non-existence when making counter arguments.

    Atheists do not presuppose god’s non-existence, atheists are simply unconvinced of god’s existence. Arguments made by theists can be refuted without appealing to god’s non existence.

    Arguments made by atheists against god’s existence, be they a priori or a posteriori, are not invalid due to the fact that proponents of presuppositionialism have failed to establish reason and logic as being dependent upon the existence of god.


One last thing…

    When I became convinced that the universe was natural, that all the ghosts and gods were myths, there entered into my brain, into my soul, into every drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling, the joy of freedom. The walls of my prison crumbled and fell. The dungeon was flooded with light and all the bolts and bars and manacles turned to dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf, or a slave. There was for me no master in all the wide world, not even in infinite space.

    I was free to think. Free to express my thoughts, free to live in my own ideal. Free to live for myself and those I loved. Free to use all my faculties, all my senses. Free to spread imagination’s wings, free to investigate, to guess, and dream and hope. Free to judge and determine for myself. Free to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds, all the inspired books that savages have produced, and the barbarous legends of the past. Free from sanctified mistakes and “holy” lies. Free from the fear of eternal pain, free from the winged monsters of the night. Free from devils, ghosts and gods. For the first time I was free.

    There were no prohibited places in all of the realm of thought. No error, no space where fancy could not spread her painted wings. No chains for my limbs. No lashes for my back. No flames for my flesh. No Master’s frown or threat, no following in another’s steps. No need to bow or cringe or crawl, or utter lying words. I was free; I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously faced all worlds.

    My heart was filled with gratitude, with thankfulness, and went out in love to all the heroes, the thinkers who gave their lives for liberty of hand and brain, for the freedom of labor and thought to those who fell on the fierce fields of war. To those who died in dungeons, bound in chains, to those by fire consumed, to all the wise, the good, the brave of every land whose thoughts and deeds have given freedom to the sons of men. And then, I vowed to grasp the torch that they held, and hold it high, That light might conquer darkness still.

    No, they’re not. There are no calls for slavery, rape or murder in the atheist holy book.

    Atheists are most often called ‘militant’ when they passionately defend reason and advocate critical thinking. The bar theists set for perceived atheist hostility appears to be any atheist simply voicing an opinion in dissent of religious belief. In contrast, the bar atheists set for perceived theistic hostility is any form of religiously motivated violence or oppression.

    Atheism does not preclude someone from being argumentative or insensitive; those things are simply seen as being preferable to killing one another over an imaginary friend.

    A ‘militant’ atheist will debate in a University theater or appeal for the separation of religion and government. A militant theist will kill doctors, stone women to death, incite religious war, restrict sexual and gender equality and convince children they are flawed and worthless – all under the instruction of their imagined ‘god’ or holy book.

    It can be argued that there is no such thing as a ‘militant’ atheist, that the term is itself a misnomer, because there is simply no ideology or philosophy in atheism to be militant about. If an atheist is someone who lacks belief in gods, then a ‘militant’ atheist is apparently someone who passionately lacks a belief in gods. All other possible beliefs and ideologies – including the desire to oppress theism – come from outside atheism. This is in contrast to religious belief, which often includes a set of laws and commandments purportedly derived from a supernatural source which one can actually be ‘militant’ about.

    Note: ‘Militant’ atheism is most often confused with gosateizm (state atheism), which was based on the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. It was this ideology which was responsible for the oppression and murder of theists under several 20th century communist regimes. Atheism is simply a lack of belief in gods with no inherit moral, political or philosophical baggage..

But guess what – your religious wars, jihads, crusades, inquisitions, censoring of free speech, brainwashing of children, forcing girls into underage marriages, female genital mutilation, stoning, pederasty, homophobia and rejection of science and reason offend me.

    Where is god? (Interjection)

    Argument from non-belief.

    Why is it now that we have developed rational inquiry we hear only a deafening silence from a god who once supposedly engaged regularly in human affairs? Why does god not simply speak to us or appear before us as he supposedly used to? Why are we the losers in the dice roll of time? If a god places such a high value on us worshiping and believing then why not simply make its existence obvious to us?

    If one accepts the prevailing scientific understanding of the development of the universe, but also believes in one of the major religions, then presumably a god sat idle for 13.7 billion years – waiting as the galaxies, stars and planets formed. Then it watched with complete and utter indifference as modern Homo Sapians evolved, struggled and died for a further 100,000 years. Finally, a few thousand years ago, this god suddenly decided to reveal itself to several people in the most primitive, illiterate and remote portions of humanity in a completely unverifiable way – and then simply disappeared.

    If Jesus is God then presumably he is omniscient. If this is true, then when he allowed himself to be sacrificed, didn’t he do this with the knowledge that he was immortal? If so, then how exactly was it a sacrifice for him? What did he sacrifice?

    “If Jesus is the son of god, but also god himself, then he supposedly sacrificed himself to himself to save what he created from himself. He also, therefore, prayed to himself and begged himself not to require himself be crucified in order to appease himself and save the world from the wrath of himself.” – Anonymous
    Jesus was wholly good and moral.

    Assuming the figure even existed, this position is incorrect.

    “There’s no hell mentioned in the Old Testament. The punishment of the dead is not specified there. It’s only with gentle Jesus, meek and mild, that the idea of eternal torture for minor transgressions is introduced.” – Christopher Hitchens
    Atheists are close-minded.

    Being open-minded does not mean accepting claims outright, it means demonstrating the willingness to consider new ones. An open-minded person is receptive to new ideas, opinions and arguments and wants to discover their real truth-value before accepting them. Atheists are generally very open-minded.

    Unjustified belief in the supernatural does not automatically make someone open-minded and, conversely, disbelief (pending further evidence) does not automatically make someone close-minded.

    Atheists simply do not usually exhibit gullibility or credulity. They maintain a standard of evidence proportional to the extraordinary nature of certain claims. They are usually open to the idea of god, but so far unconvinced by any evidence or argument put forward to support it.

    “A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence” – David Hume
    Atheism leads to a worse society.

    Atheism and secularism correlate highly with the well-being of individuals and societies by almost every possible measure.

    Atheism is correlated with better scientific literacy, lower poverty rates, higher literacy rates, higher average incomes, less violence, lower divorce rates, lower teen pregnancy rates, lower STD infection rates, lower crime rates and lower homicide rates.

    The Argument from Beauty fails to explain why some things are beautiful to some people and not to others, and also fails to establish beauty as something immaterial instead of being a subjective neurological response to stimuli.

    Human beauty is physical and psychological attractiveness, it helps us choose a healthy partner with whom to reproduce. Abstract beauty, like art, landscapes and music, are an artefact of culture and the way our brain interprets color, shapes and sound.

    The world is not always beautiful: decay/entropy in physical systems and disease/death among living creatures are natural functions of physics and biology. For example, there exists a species of worm known as Loa Loa Filariasis. This parasite lives underneath the skin and inside the eyes of human beings. Children and the elderly in tropical regions (usually the poorest) are the most widely affected. A slow, painful death is virtually certain.

    “Isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?” – Douglas Adams

    “The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all species are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.” – Richard Dawkins

    Smart person X believes in god or ‘You are not qualified’.

    Ad hominem + Argument from Authority.

    Invisible pink unicorns exist. You’re not an expert in them, so you can’t say they don’t.

    The validity of a claim, such as the existence of god, is not governed by the intelligence of the minds which hold it. Evidence and reason are the deciding factors.

    Sir Isaac Newton, one of history’s greatest scientists, was not only intensely religious but also believed in alchemical transmutation. Alchemy is, however, fully incorrect given our modern understanding of chemistry, the atom and nucleosynthysis.

    The fact that an intelligent person holds an irrational belief is simply evidence that our brains are able to compartmentalise world-views and models from one another, usually in order to maintain a state of ‘ignorant bliss’ and escape the discomfort of cognitive dissonance.
    The universe is fine-tuned for life.

    The universe is extremely hostile to life. Extinction events on Earth have nearly eliminated complex life on five separate occasions. Of all the species that have ever lived 99.9% are now extinct. Furthermore, normal matter like stars and planets occupy less than 0.0000000000000000000042 percent of the observable universe. Life constitutes an even smaller fraction of that matter again. If the universe is fine-tuned for anything it is for the creation of black holes [2].

    There is nothing to suggest that human life, our planet or our universe are uniquely privileged nor intended. On the contrary, the sheer scale of the universe in both space and time and our understanding of its development all indicate we are non-central to the scheme of things; mere products of chance, physical laws and evolution. To believe otherwise amounts to an argument from incredulity and a hubris mix of anthropocentrism and god of the gaps thinking.

    The conditions that we observe, namely, those around our Sun and on Earth, simply seem fine-tuned to us because we evolved to suit them. We cannot prove that all other possible forms of life would be infeasible with a different set of conditions or constants because the only universe that we can observe is the one we occupy. Indeed, modelling  suggests star formation (a necessary precursor to our form of biology) may be viable under a number of different universal conditions.

    Without actual proof of creation, naturalistic explanations for the properties of this universe cannot be wholly ruled out. It is possible an infinity of universes exist, all with different conditions and forms of life. The fact that our particular universe has the constants we observe may be no more to the point than the fact a hand of cards, dealt from a shuffled deck, is the one a hypothetical player observes. Though the chances of any one universe being hospitable to life might be low, the conditional probability of a form of life observing a set of constants suitable to it is exactly unity. That is to say, every possible universe would ‘appear’ fine-tuned to the form of life it harbours, while all those inhospitable universes would never be observed at all.

    “The universe is not fine-tuned to life; life is fine-tuned to the universe.” – Victor Stenger

    “Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, ‘This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn’t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!’ This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it’s still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything’s going to be all right, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.” - Douglas Adams",,False,self,t5_2qq2r,False,,,True,t3_qxod1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/qxod1/why_there_is_no_god_part_v/,

I notice many major religion's preach some sort of monist concept to some extent which I find pretty interesting.

I guess my personal beliefs can be described as:

I believe everything in the universe comes from a common source. I have no idea what this source is. I feel as though this sort of concept is ineffable and beyond normal human comprehension. But the best analogy I can describe is that this source is like a flashlight and the material world is the light coming from it. Nothing can exist without this source. The material world is imperfect by the very nature of having to be dependent on this source. Growth and decay and so on. I guess I respect that concept. I don't submit to anything in my life but I guess i'm thankful to have been lucky enough to exist. There is no point in having an inflated ego when my reality is so fragile and one of a kind as it is. And so I respect my surroundings and my fellow man. Nature and really the universe as a whole is a beautiful thing and I think existence is a beautiful thing. I don't really believe in Good or evil but I believe in Truth and deception for sure. And the philosophical history of humanity is basically centered around a search for Truth in addition to survival.

I suppose I also subscribe to idealism rather than materialism. I guess the best way I can logically integrate this is when I read up on some aspects of Quantum Mechanics. The theory that everything in our material world is derived from a single infinite wave and so on. But our minds play the most fundamental part in shaping our own personal realities.

But there are so many things that have yet to be discovered. Science can only examine the physical and material world. But everything beyond that isn't something we can examine. Just as our universe came from a singularity we have no idea what was beyond that. That is as nonsensical as talking about an ""outside"" to our universe. But of course it's very possible that there is an ""outside"" to our universe but as of now  those questions are beyond current scientific understanding.

    Agnosticism is the view that the truth value of certain claims is unknown or unknowable. It is a philosophical position not necessarily tied to god’s existence or non-existence. One can be agnostic about any claim. The word originates from the Ancient Greek ἀ- (a-), meaning “without”, and γνῶσις (gnōsis), meaning “knowledge” – “without knowledge”.

    Most atheists, including famous ones such as Richard Dawkins, fall into the category of ‘Agnostic Atheism’ – they don’t claim to know with certainty that god does not exist. Conversely, most theists are ‘Gnostic Theists’ – they claim to know with certainty that their particular god exists.

    When most atheists say “God does not exist” they are generally speaking in the same manner as when people say “Leprechauns/Santa Claus/Fairies/Unicorns don’t exist” – those things do not appear exist within contextual reality in which we find ourselves but, importantly, the statement is not necessarily an absolute one.

    There are, however, gnostic atheists who are certain no god exists and they generally point to logical problems that would arise from said god’s existence or evidence this universe is inconsistent with a god, for example:
        Infinite Regression
        Argument from Poor Design
        The Atheist’s Wager
        Non-belief Paradox
        Omnipotence Paradox
        Free Will Paradox
        Argument from locality
        Argument from Non-reason
        Argument from incompatible properties
        Fate of the Unlearned
        Problem of Evil and Problem of Hell

    See also: The Dragon in my Garage by Carl Sagan.
    What would convince an atheist of a god’s existence?

    A particular standard of evidence is required to prove any claim. This ‘standard’ is adjusted depending upon the nature of the claim. Since god’s existence is an extraordinary claim, perhaps the most extraordinary claim, proving it requires equally extraordinary evidence.

    The standard of evidence required to prove a god’s existence is immediately more than any personal anecdote, witness testimony, ancient book or reported miracle – none of which can be considered extraordinarily reliable. The human mind is also highly susceptible to being fooled and even fooling itself. One could be suffering from an hallucination or a form of undiagnosed schizophrenia, hysteria or psychosis, ruling out even our own senses as reliable evidence gathering mechanisms in this case. As strange as it sounds, misunderstood aliens might even be attempting to interact with us using extremely advanced technology. In fact, reality itself could be a computer simulation which we unknowingly inhabit.

    Every conceivable argument, every imaginable piece of evidence for god is not without some fatal flaw or more likely explanation which precludes it from being used as definitive proof. Note: This is not the same as being close-minded.

    There is, however, a simple answer to this question: God is what it would take to convince an atheist. An omniscient god would know the exact standard of evidence required to convince any atheist of its existence and, being omnipotent, it would also be able to immediately produce this evidence. If it wanted to, a god could conceivably change the brain chemistry of any individual in order to compel them to believe. It could even restructure the entire universe in such a way as to make non-belief impossible.

    In short, a god actually proving its own existence is what would convince any atheist of said god’s existence.

Ignores and does not eliminate the fact that something can seem incredible or unlikely and still be true, or appear to be obvious or likely and yet still be false.

    The world is the way it is. Reality does not bend to our personal whim and facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored. Our personal belief in something does not automatically make it real or true and, conversely, our lack of understanding of a topic does not make it false.

    Until we understand something we “do not know”. Positing a ‘god’ in place of admitting personal ignorance is an unfounded leap which demonstrates a fundamental lack of humility.

    The existence and non-existence of a god are not equally probable outcomes. The majority of things we can possibly imagine do not exist. Thus, belief is not as valid a position as skepticism when dealing with unsupported or unfalsifiable claims. Agnostic atheism is the most rational position.

    “It is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.” – Carl Sagan

    “God is an ever-receding pocket of ignorance that’s getting smaller and smaller as time goes on.”- Neil deGrasse Tyson

    There is no evidence god doesn’t exist, so belief is as justified or as valid as non-belief.

    Argument from ignorance.

    A common attempt to shift the burden of proof or ‘make room’ for a god. Represents a type of false dichotomy that excludes the fact that there is insufficient investigation and the proposition has not yet been proven either true or false.

    The failure to disprove the existence of something does not constitute proof of its existence.

    Belief is not as valid a position as skepticism when dealing with unsupported or unfalsifiable claims because all such claims would need to be believed implicitly. Agnostic atheism is the most rational position.


    Atheists should prove god doesn’t exist.

    Russell’s teapot.

    The burden of proof is on the person or party asserting the claim; in this case, the theist.

    Atheism takes faith / is a religion.

    Calling atheism a religion is like calling bald a hair color, or not collecting stamps a hobby.

    Atheism is simply a lack of belief in a god or gods, nothing more. If we deconstruct the term ‘atheism’ we find ‘a – theism’ which means ‘without – theism’ which, in turn, means ‘without – belief in god(s)’. It is, therefore, not a positive belief or a claim to knowledge. Instead, it is the default position of doubt, uncertainty and skepticism one may have regarding claims made by theists. Just as it takes no faith to lack belief or remain uncertain concerning any other imaginable claim, it takes none to doubt the existence of a god or gods. Every human-being ever born begins life as an implicit atheist and must be taught the concept of theism or, more commonly, indoctrinated with it.

    Atheism has no sacred texts, objects, places or times, no rituals or creation stories, no positive beliefs, central tenants, modes of worship or supernatural claims, no implicit or derived moral codes, philosophies or world views and no central organization or church. It fulfills none of the criteria that define a religion. See also: Atheism is a religion.

    Atheists may subscribe to any additional ideologies, philosophies and belief systems they choose, eg. Buddhism, Jainism, Universalism, Environmentalism, Pragmatism, Liberalism, Socialism, Libertarianism, Conservatism, etc. They may even appreciate components of traditional religion and spiritualism, including any supernatural elements unrelated to a god. Common among many atheists, however, is an appreciation for secularism, rationalism, humanism, skepticism, naturalism, materialism and freethinking – none of which are implicit or derived from atheism, nor necessary in order to lack belief.

    “To say that atheism requires faith is as dim-witted as saying that disbelief in pixies or leprechauns takes faith.

 Phenomenon X has a non-physical component.

    Baseless assertion. Unfalsifiable. How can you prove it?

    There have been numerous claims of the supernatural, none of which have ever been demonstrated to be true. Furthermore, these claims are often mutually contradictory, and people who believe in one form of supernatural or paranormal activity will usually not believe in others due to cognitive bias and wishful thinking.

    Proposing a non-physical explanation for an observed or imagined/fabricated phenomena is not a testable hypothesis and is therefore unworthy of serious consideration. It precludes any deeper insight or understanding and offers no means of distinction from any other possible supernatural claim.

    There are many as yet unexplained phenomena and anomalies in nature. The scientific approach to these is to say “I don’t know yet” and keep on looking, not to presume an answer which makes us comfortable.

    Note: This claim often represents a deep discomfort with uncertainty or ambiguity, demonstrating a lack of critical thinking or poor understanding of a topic. It usually coincides with credulity, which is the tendency to believe in propositions unsupported by evidence. See also: gullibility.

    “What can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof.” – Christopher Hitchens

    “I don’t feel frightened by not knowing things, I think it’s much more interesting that way … I have approximate answers, and possible beliefs, and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I’m not absolutely sure of anything. I might think about it a little, but if I can’t figure it out, then I go to something else. It doesn’t frighten me.” – Richard Feynman
    Materialism/Evidentialism/Science cannot recognise supernatural phenomena.

    Distortion of reality. Lack of Critical thinking. The Dragon in my Garage by Carl Sagan. What is real? What constitutes knowledge? Are all supernatural claims implicitly true? Why/Why not?

    A person who disbelieves for poor reasons is no better off than someone who believes for poor reasons. Disbelieving in astrology because a priest tells you to is no better than believing in a god because the same priest tells you to do so.

    Science observes the physical universe, makes models of how it works and then refines those models through further observation. When something interacts with the physical universe, such as through light, motion, sound, heat, mass or gravity, it becomes a natural phenomena and thus open scientific inquiry. If it does not interact with the physical universe then it cannot be said to exist in any meaningful or perceivable way. Furthermore, when supernatural claims become sufficiently nebulous one may ask if there is any substantive difference between them being true and nothing existing at all.

    Proposing the existence of an entity or phenomena that can never be investigated via empirical, experimental or reproducible means moves it from the realm of reality and into the realm of unfalsifiable speculation. The inability of science to investigate or disprove such a hypothesis is not the same as proving it true and neither does it automatically lend credence to any metaphysical or theological argument. If such reasoning were actually permissible then one could claim anything imaginable to be real or true if only because it could not be proven false.

    Relying on supernatural explanations is a cop-out or a dead-end to deepening our understanding of reality. If a natural cause for something is not known, the scientific approach is to say “I don’t know yet” and keep on looking, not to presume an answer which makes us comfortable.

    The Teleological argument , or Argument from Design, is a non sequitur. Complexity does not imply design and does not prove the existence of a god. Even if design could be established we cannot conclude anything about the nature of the designer (Aliens?). Furthermore, many biological systems have obvious defects consistent with the predictions of evolution by means of natural selection.

    The appearance of complexity and order in the universe is the result of spontaneous self-organization and pattern formation, caused by chaotic feedback between simple physical laws and rules. All the complexity of the universe, all its apparent richness, even life itself, arises from simple, mindless rules repeated over and over again for billions of years. Current scientific theories are able to clearly explain how complexity and order arise in physical systems. Any lack of understanding does not immediately imply ‘god’.

    Note: Crystallisation is one example of how matter can readily self-organise into complex, ordered shapes and structures eg. Bismuth.

    “The universe is huge and old and rare things happen all the time, including life.” – Lawrence Krauss

    “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” – Charles Darwin

    Affection, empathy and peer bonding increase social cohesion and lead to higher survival chances for offspring.

    “You do not need the Bible to justify love, but no better tool has been invented to justify hate.” – Richard Weatherwax
    God is the universe/love/laws of physics.

    We already have names for these things. Redefining something as ‘god’ tells us nothing. To use the word ‘god’ implies a host of other attributes and if you don’t intend to apply those attributes, using the word is intentionally misleading.

    “To call the world God is not to explain it; it is only to enrich our language with a superfluous synonym for the word ‘world’.” – Arthur Schopenhauer
    Science can’t explain X, therefore god/theism.

    God of the gaps. Argument from Ignorance.

    Simply because you or the scientific community lack a complete understanding of something does not imply a theistic explanation carries any value. Even if there exists some topic on which science can never speak, any understanding could potentially evade us forever – supernatural or metaphysical speculation would not automatically be correct. Uncertainty is the most legitimate position.

    Lightning, earthquakes, volcano's, disease, mental illness, speciation, planetary orbits and numerous other phenomena have been historically labeled ‘supernatural’ only to later be more thoroughly and elegantly explained by science. In fact, every mystery ever solved has had non-supernatural explanation. To suggest that science cannot or will not explain a phenomena, and that only theism can, is hubris of the highest order.

    Using ‘god’ to explain something explains nothing. God’s supposed powers and how they work are a mystery. An explanation is intended to clarify and extend knowledge. Attributing a phenomenon to the magical powers of a supernatural being does neither. Worse still, this presumption acts to prevent any deeper investigation, being little more than a form of blissful ignorance.

    Note: By using ‘god’ to fill gaps in their knowledge theists inadvertently provide a shrinking role for their god as science advances.

    Argument from personal experience.

    A result of our naturally evolved neurology, made hypersensitive to purpose (an ‘unseen actor’) because of the large social groups humans have and the way the brain associates pattern with intent.

    Humans have evolved a variety of cognitive shortcuts to deal with the mass of information provided by our senses. In particular, we tend to: filter sensory input according to a set of expectations built on prior beliefs and past experiences, impart meaning to ambiguous input even when there is no real meaning behind it and infer causal relationships where none exist.

    Personal revelation cannot be independently verified. These so-called ‘revelations’ never include information a recipient could not have known beforehand, such as the time and location of a rare event or answers to any number of unsolved problems in science. They are usually emotional or perceptional in content and therefore unremarkable among the many cognitive processes brains exhibit, including dreams and hallucinations. These experiences can even be artificially induced by narcotics or magnetic fields. Extreme cases may be diagnosed as a form of schizophrenia or psychosis.

    Spiritual and religious experiences are not only inconsistent among individuals but are variably attributed to different gods, aliens, spirits, rituals, hallucinations, meditation etc. The fact that medical conditions and other natural processes [2] can induce these experiences is evidence they are produced by our brain.

    See also: NPR Your brain on god?, Hardwired for religion?, Searching for God in the Brain, The Economist, BBC Doco, PBS Doco and Dawkins on the topic, Deconversion: Personal Relationship (a must watch), TED – How it feels to have a stroke (a must watch) and TED – Ramachandran on your mind.

    “You can tell you’ve created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do.” – Anne Lamott

    People who believe in god are happier.

    The claim that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality.

    Atheism is correlated with better scientific literacy [2][3], lower poverty rates, higher literacy rates, higher average incomes, less violence, lower divorce rates, lower teen pregnancy rates, lower STD infection rates, lower crime rates and lower homicide rates. It correlates highly with the well-being of individuals and societies by almost every possible measure.

    Studies on happiness outside of predominantly religious countries (eg. the United States) find little to no correlation between happiness and religious belief. This corresponds with evidence which shows social and community bonding, rather than spiritual engagement, explains why religious people report greater satisfaction with life. Atheists, by comparison, may also simply be unhappy with the level of distrust and persecution they receive from their compatriots.

My entire extended family knows that I am an Atheist. I have about 20 first cousins, and I don't know how many second cousins, and they all know that I am an Atheist. All of my friends know that I am an Atheist. Some of the first people I told in my family were Bible thumping science deniers. One of them was an engineer and very bright, but it's just what their Christian conservatism demands of them. I did all of this when I was still a minor and financially depended on my family.

I have never felt penalized for being an Atheist in any context, including my family. I find the Atheist community wonderfully humourous and intelligent, and I wouldn't trade it for the most vibrant Church group, since the most vibrant Church is the dullest chat room.

I do not understand why you Americans have such a hard time coming out. Nobody even cares about what I do or don't believe, nor do I go around talking about my Atheism. If it comes up, I just self-identify and move on. That's how I came out to the Bible thumpers. They are the ones you will end up coming out to because they are always the first to bring up the subject of ""God.""

I cannot comprehend someone throwing out a loved one because of their Atheism. Blood is thicker than water. Why should an ethereal meme trump a flesh and blood gene? Kinship is the basis of human relationships. Without it, we have nothing. To me, there is no better test for evil. If something actively breaks up tribes, the most fundamental unit of primate society, for some ideological reason then you know for certain that it is a mental disease. Know that when you are actively discriminated against for apostasy, the meme in your kin's head is being deleterious and viral. It is forcing them to override their most fundamental instincts to choose incantation and indoctrination than the simple chemical romance that binds us all.

You are not under duress. You cannot be jailed, fined, or killed for being an apostate if you live in the free world. Don't come out, just walk out. Walk out of faith like it's nobody's business - because it isn't. Raise your apostasy if necessary, or raise it casually when the subject comes up. There is no reason any of us should be ashamed of our apostasy. We all know the evidence, and more importantly, the law is on our side. If you feel that you have been unlawfully penalized for apostasy, sue. That is how the homosexuals liberated and continue to liberate themselves. If you are banished from your home, seek council or post on /r/atheism for help. There are millions of believers and non-believers who will take you in if your family chooses to Darwinize itself by banishing you.

I would like that changed to ""militant anti-theist"".  For the same reason we don't call bin laden a Muslim, we call him a jihadist, we shouldn't refer to Dawkins as an atheist, he is an anti-theist.  
  
Please edit the wikipedia article for Richard Dawkins, thank you.
