Can the average Joe buy the IPO shares at $35 (estimated price) and then sell them a week or two later at whatever price they are at?

I ask because I don't think that the share value will hold long term.  As popular as FB might be, still an internet company.  It might have a long term sustainability compare to MySpace, Groupon, or maybe even Netflix.  I remember that Google stocks came out like $100 a share, and quickly jump to about $800 dollars.   

I'm thinking, what if you were to invest $5000 in the $35 share, and then sell them at $100 (my guess) you would be making  $14,000 (minus fees and taxes).

That seems like a good investment....now the the question, is it doable?

* Mining sector on AIM only at the moment.
* It's not 100% so I have to get rid of false positives before sticking them up here.
* Do your own research.

**Edit**
Why am I doing this instead of making tons of money myself?

1. Because I'm an out of work PM in finance, and I'm bored.
1. Because I don't have funds to invest myself, so I felt like spreading the love.

I have a huge problem of my own ignorance. Back in 1999, I did some day trading and lost money. Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the tax rules and just failed to file income taxes. Then I left the States and am back now.

Well, the securities firm (Southwest Securities) filed $1.1million income on a 1099 (sales only). I need to reconstruct my buys (I have no documentation, ugh) to offset.

SW Securities is attempting to find my transactions. If they cannot, what recourse do I have?? I'm on the hook for a $300,000 tax bill which will ruin my life. 

How can I get my trading history if SW Securities doesn't have it? Is there any way to prove my buys orders??

If there's a 3D printing stock you missed a big run on, SGLB is your second chance IMO.

Any advice?,23,10,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/158dki/first_time_investor_any_advice/,"I'm an australian student of engineering with no experience in investing. I've recently saved up some money and set up a trading account so I'm ready to get started. At first I considered commodities (gold in particular) as the price is constantly increasing in the long run. However I was turned off by the high price as I could only afford a small amount which wouldn't lead to large growth. So then I considered silver as it's cheaper than gold but I'm guessing it will follow a similar positive trend. Then I started looking at silver mining companies as I figured I might as well go to the source and I landed on this one in particular:

Silver Mines Limited - http://www.silverminesltd.com.au/

The stock price is currently around 5c/ share which if I invest $1000 I would get 20,000 shares. It seems they've recently been granted approval to start drilling in January and I'm guessing if all goes well, the price of the stock will rise.

See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option 

My current preferred flavor of generating some extra income is to buy 100 shares of QQQ at a time (ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100), then sell a weekly call option at the same strike price. http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/qqq/option-chain

Here's how that works:

1. You'll see from the nasdaq.com link that QQQ finished trading on Friday at $72.58. For this example, we'll say I bought 100 shares at $72.50. Total spent = $7,250 + commission = $7257. 

2. Look on the option chain and find the call options (on the left) that expire on July 12. One call option gives the right to buy 100 shares of stock. In my case, I'm selling one July 12 call with strike price of 72.50. When I sell this option, I get what the market maker is bidding. This is currently shown in the Bid column as 0.56/share. On 100 shares, this is $56 - commission = $49. 

3. The person that bought my call now has the right to buy my 100 shares from me for $72.50/share any time between now and next Friday. If the stock is trading at $72.50 or less between now and then, they will not exercise this option and it will expire worthless next Friday. 

4. If they exercise the option, I sell the stock for $72.50/share (which is what I paid for it). I receive $7250 - commission = $7243. 

5. In this case, my profit is 7243+49-7257 = $35. This is 0.48%/wk, or 25%/yr.

6. If they do not exercise the option and it expires, my profit is $49. I turn around and sell the option again next week. $49 profit is 0.68%/wk, or 35%/yr. 

A more volatile market will command higher premiums for the options, but more risk for me on the downside if the stock drops. Obviously $35/wk is chump change, so this only starts to get exciting when talking about doing it on a larger scale.

I like to mess with the pennies a bit with my ""high risk"" money.  Take it or leave it, as it could make you rich or could lose it all.  Not for the faint of heart and never GAMBLE with what you can't lose!

Pacific Gold Corp is an alluvial gold mining company that owns mineral rights at several locations, the main one currently being Black Rock Canyon in NV.  They have been in business for quite a while, but ran into some problems along the way.  A few years ago, they started producing gold, but because they could not clean the gravel at an acceptable rate and return water... they stopped producing.  

The pps plummeted to .001 and they finally put out a PR saying what they needed to do (install Geotubes) and that they were at a standstill until they got financing and after they procured financing... they needed 6 months up and running.  Well, they got financing at 10% or convertible to .05 cents (the pps was about .026 at that time) and it is a bit over 6 months.

They have been given approval by the NDEP(Nevada Environmental protection) to begin production and we basically are waiting for the final PR... which I think will increase the pps, but there is more.  Here is a list of the things we have seen and are looking for.

*  The company ran out of money and stopped filing for a long while.  They were delisted, but exactly TODAY they were relisted as an OTC stock.

*  They installed the Geotubes that they were waiting for.  They have PRed that they are submitting plans to install 8-10 more.  The speculation is that they are already planning expansion.

*  They were given permission to begin producing, but we have not seen the PR that they actually ARE producing.  For what it is worth, a few people have said they have drove by the mine and there was LOTS of activity... including it appears conveyer belts.  Also, we have seen several pictures of the site as it has changed the past 9 months.

*  They have not diluted the stock in a long while.

*  We have seen confirmation from NDEP (the Nevada Environmental Protection agency) that work is being done on the site.

* They have updated the machinery so they should be able to pull more gold out of the gravel than they were able to previously.

*  They anticipate that they will pull out 480,000 cy of gravel in the first year of operations.  They also anticipate that they will see a recovery rate of .5g/cy... although in previous production and tests of ""low grade"" gravel, they recovered .11 and .18 g/cy.  If they can maintain the throughput of 480,000 cy,  they will generate  $2,790,000 at a minimum and if they meet .5g/cy, they will generate 12.7 million.  When they produced a few years ago, the operating costs were about $170,000/month.  Even with increased costs, they should be golden if they hit the production throughput.  As you can tell, there really is much room for error also.

*BRC is only one of the mines that they have... they have others that can be reviewed or leased out.

Obviously, there is lot's of room for this to suck also... as it is a penny stock, but my money is on this doing well... I think very well.

This sort of shot up today with news of the uplisting (25%) with good volume, but I think there is a ton more for this to grow.  I am going to sell my initial investment and play with the freebies soon, but I have huge hopes here.... life changer hopes.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback tomorrow and it might be a good addition on an intraday pullback.  

Anyhow, I hope you like the tip.  If not, I hope you appreciate the DD.... I love the pennies for the level of involvement and sleuthing you can get into.

With Apple releasing their earning reports tomorrow, I am interested in what you guys think. 

My questions are:

1. What are some things to look out for that will signal either a drop or an increase in stock values? 

2. What are other things in particular that I should look into prior, during, and after their earnings report gets released?

3. What are the general consensus of Apple holders and potential buyers? Should holders sell or buy?

Why I chose Apple is because it's most likely going to be widely observed and monitored. I am a total newbie to stocks, so I chose Apple as one of the companies I will be observing, and coincidentally their earnings report for Q1 is being release tomorrow.

Shorting the Apple stock,19,9,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g2s4x/just_finished_steve_jobs_biography_wish_i_read_it/,"This is going to sound like a rant but its really an observation and opinion.
After reading his bio I now understand why the stock plummeted from $700 to $400.

(My humble opinion)
Unless something drastic occurs, there will be nothing new from Apple going forward. Anything which appears to be a new release will be a refining on something which is already developed. Anything actually new which Apply might invent/release will be a complete flop. I do not see them reinventing any other industry like Steve did with Music.

There is a reason why Apple almost went bankrupt when Steve was ousted in the 80s, there is no one else who can take his place and move Apple in the same direction. I see Jobs leaving Cook in charge because Cook was the least horrible of all other choices not because he was the ""best"" of all other choices. (Cook is a great tech CEO, but he is no Steve).

Dont get me wrong, I love Apple and everything they have done, but that Apple was really Steve Jobs and now, its just a corporation with a lot of money, a lot of talented people, a good CEO and just like a lot of other tech companies.

*What I bought:* GTE (Gran Tierra Energy)


*Price Paid:* 6.34


*Why This Company:* Their earnings report came back showing production up and costs down. They think they might find more oil than initially set out to find. Their expansions not only look promising but are being paid for by their positive cash flow (company holds no debt I think). Lots of the overhead from last year was acquiring new land as they are a new company themselves. They are not an exporter (they just sell out of Columbia) So I like that there are less moving parts. BUT they do have pending agreements with governments in the region that could hurt or benefit the price depending.


*Why Now (Chart talk):* Looking at the 1Y..Big institutions started moving money out which started a downward trend which saw some resistance around the 6.50 mark but then continued down to 4.50 recently. Now however, the high volume moves come with an increase in price and the moving average is acting as support rather than resistance. The SMA, and MACD/Divergence are moving sideways.. with a few big fluctuations in price which might signal a change in direction. I believe that this stock will start a new upward trend... and so that's why I bought.


OK. So that's my thinking. But I'm new to this. What did I miss? I have no idea how to really interpret the P/E on this... are there red flags that you guys see that I dont? Am I doing anything fundamentally wrong? I'd appreciate it very much for any insight you might have into how big of a mistake I just made.


P.S. If this is against rules to talk about stocks you bought I'll take this down. I had to tell so people can critique what I actually did. Thanks!

For some reason on that day, the brokerage's system placed a second buy order of 100 shares (resulting in a short position as I had already sold shares). When I called them to complain as to why the short position (additional 100 shares) existed, the brokerage customer service rep. first said that I might have made a mistake when entering in data; then when I told him I didn't, he said they would contact the fraud department in case somebody compromised my account. The fraud department contacted me and said they didn't see any unusual IP addresses logging in or any signs of fraud and that they considered it to be a trade executed by me (I didn't think there was fraud, per se).  After I emailed Customer Service a strongly worded statement that I had nothing to do with that short trade, they went ahead and cancelled the short at no expense (""Sale Not Long Commitment""). Question is, do brokerages make errors in executing an order by entering it in twice when I entered it once? And do they routinely cancel short positions if you complain?

I've been looking at the company 'CPP' very closely, only to find that it has risen to 7.27 outside of market hours, and the sell price + the buy price have remained to the 4.50 and the 5.3 based on the site http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/c/cpp-group-plc-ordinary-10p?tab=security_details

However, another site such as

It could be something so so simple, just can't work it out.

1351967509.0,7,self.stocks,12ko1x,An Argument for Investing in Timber REITs,12,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ko1x/an_argument_for_investing_in_timber_reits/,"The two main goals of investing are capital preservation and capital growth.  The  timber industry , like any captive renewable resource, is an industry trusted for capital preservation.  The timber can be an engine for capital growth when unforeseen circumstances cause a rapid increase in demand for wood products.  Now is the time to invest in timber producers.

Investment in timber lands preserve capital because the demand for wood has been stable and growing for centuries.  In times of economic slowness  the demand for timber products for new housing and other large projects slows, but continues.  Demand for Timber products such as toilet paper and 2x4’s for home repair are relatively unaffected.  Timber companies can engage in the sale of non-core assets, especially forest land near metropolitan areas, to maintain profitability in down years.  An investment in timber lands is a good way to preserve capital.

When national economies are growing an investment in timber lands can also be expected to appreciate.  When people have jobs they want to buy a home, upgrade their existing home or add quality wood furniture to their homes.  Companies are willing to invest in growth and need buildings to support that growth.  People with a BBQ grill on a concrete pad in their backyard are going to upgrade to a wooden deck when they feel financially secure.  This is priced into the market due to the rapid gains timber REITs have seen over the past 12 months.

When there is large scale destruction the demand for timber increases rapidly.  This was seen  recently after Japan’s Fukushima disaster when the value of Timber REITs in the western US and Canada increased due to the expectation of increased wood sales to Japan.  I’ve looked at the pictures of the New Jersey shore before hurricane Sandy and I see beautiful wood houses;  I look at the pictures of houses in Trenton and I see wood flooring under a foot of water.   The value of timber REITs have remained stable and have not priced in this increase in demand.

Investing in a timber REIT provides capital to companies that produce timber.  It allows timber REITs to increase production of wood products used in rebuilding efforts.  Investing in timber REITs does not increase the demand for wood, but is an investment in the supply of wood.  An investment in timber REITs does not increase the cost of wood just when citizens of the New Jersey shore need wood products to rebuild their lives.  An investment in Timber REITs rather redirects capital to the production of wood products which should tend to hold down costs to our fellow citizens.  Investing in a timber REIT is an ethically correct decision.

Timber REITs provide a stable long term investment that provide capital preservation and this is priced into the market.  They provide growth during economic  boom years and the expectation of North American economic growth is priced into the market.  They provide growth following natural disasters in areas that can afford to rebuild and the effects of Hurricane Sandy have not been priced into the market.  Investment in timber REITs do not drive up costs for people affected by the disaster.  Timber REITs are undervalued in the current market.  I believe Timber REITs represent an unusual opportunity in the market.

All of that said, I am an engineer and have no training as a financial analyst.  You need to do your own research before investing.  I am currently long in PCH.

What would you guys want to see in it?,8,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3y55/i_want_to_make_a_simple_yet_realistic_stock/,"By simple, I mean not fancy. It wouldn't look pretty, but I want it to be as realistic as possible, to the point where anyone who made money on the simulator could actually make money on the market. So, I have a few questions.

How reliable are the the Google Finance stock prices? GF says NYSE and NASDAQ quotes are realtime (AMEX is 15 min delay, so I couldn't realistically represent trading the AMEX in my program), so would importing the current price on GF every .5 seconds or 1 second (not sure of the Google Finance API yet), and using the most recent value as the sell/buy price be realistic? If GF says a stock is at 13.50, would selling real stock at that second sell for 13.50? I'm only 17 so have never actually traded before, so I have no idea if it would or not, but I do know quite a bit about the market.

What features are absolutely necessary to make a realistic simulator? I already plan to include stop loss orders and basic stuff like that, but what else should I include?

Does stock for highly traded companies always have buyers and sellers at market price? I know there is almost always buyers and sellers, but I'm not sure if there are always open orders at market price, as I've never traded.

That's about it, if you have any tips/suggestions or questions or anything, don't hesitate to ask, I'm super excited about this project, as it's my first, so I don't mind talking about it ;)",,False,,t5_2qjfk,False,,,True,t3_k3y55,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3y55/i_want_to_make_a_simple_yet_realistic_stock/,

The market was down big, and oil was down nearly 5% with it.  This is the first sign of oil speculators running for the doors.  This is good news as the price of oil has been inflated because of speculators not wanting to be in the dollar so they keep it in oil.  Once oil can come back down to earth (say in the $80-85 a barrel range) gas will follow shortly giving the consumer more disposable income as well as corporations and therefore should help take the double dip scenario off the table.  About 8 weeks ago, I wrote an article about oil driving the price of the market and speculators keeping oil high and therefore helping the market correct.  Well we have seen exactly that.  I said I expected the price of oil to decline after July 4th weekend and we are only a few weeks away from that.  I would say I pretty much nailed that.  I am posting the article below from back then so you can proof it again.  Happy Investing!

Would this be a wise investment?

If not, what about STX (Seagate)? They are a leading producer of storage modules such as hard drives, disk drives, and solid state drives in the technology industry, which is rapidly developing. 

Thoughts?

I'm eager to learn, and I've been reading a lot about how the stock market works, and how to invest, as well as practicing on updown.com with some fake money.

With all the talk about decker, I read up on the company a few weeks ago, and I bought in with fake money on updown at $76.27—if it had been real money, I would have sold today for a nice 20% return. I'll have around $1,000 of real money that I could invest as of tomorrow, and I'm debating whether or not to throw it at Decker and see what happens. They closed at $91.18 today, and looking at how the company has grown over the past couple of years, it stands to reason that their stock will peak around christmas, and also around mid April. With Brady supporting the brand, competent executives, and the enduring cultural popularity, it seems like the dips lately have been more a reaction to the market in general than anything else.
 
My gut is that even at $91, decker is still a good investment, but since I'm brand new to this, I'd love to hear some other opinions—affirming or denying mine, any thoughts are welcome.

1275066465.0,7,self.stocks,c9403,Are using 'Stop Sell' Orders Becoming Obsolete thanks to HFT and market manipulation?,7,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c9403/are_using_stop_sell_orders_becoming_obsolete/,"Most modern day 'trading programs' advocate a stop loss of 8-10% of some market price, be it your buy point or adding trailing stops to protect profit.

However with recent market volatility, High-Freqency Trading, admissions by major trading firms that they made money every single trading day of Q1, recruitment of Quant, math and physics majors en masse, algo program trading and much, much more automated gaming of the market, I'm beginning to wonder if they are planning for the use of these stops and other well-known tactics as a way to further profit? 

I've watched the market and my current positions and with the use of IBD and VectorVest, added some stops to my positions, only to watch them be activated, sell the stock off, then we really significantly. Stocks/ETFS from EPV, VXX, Med and others will move violently through a support point, come back, and in the coming days move up a fair move. 

Over at zerohedge, most traders are out of the market or simply day-trading it waiting for the plunge. I think it will, we just won't know when. Anyone else seeing things like this occur? 

73%+ of the market is moved by algo, hft program trading, and major institutions, so we have to believe it is alot like many titantics wreaking havoc with smaller boats and we're just along for the ride, not trying to get caught in their wake and spilled over.

I was perhaps a little remiss in not doing a little more research.  I'm a value investor, so I based my decision on valuing the company.  I generally try not to time the market, although the lock-up expiration was a big factor in my decision.

I shorted several lots, with an average price of right around $61.  The stock opened at $55 and change 4/10, and has since made a big move upwards.

In any case, having shorted similar situations in the past, I know that it's hard to know when the party might end and the stock move into a more reasonable valuation level.

I discovered some interesting tidbits looking at the options market.  Workday is upside-down.  April expiry has a maxpain at $65 (it was $67.50 just a few days ago).  May expiry has a maxpain at $57.50.  June has a maxpain at $55.  This is not very typical.  I expect for growth stocks to see these flat to slightly up over time.

I have a suspicion that the market makers and the hedge funds are marching this stock up towards maxpain expiry next Friday (4/17).

Having been involved in the IPO process myself, it's possible some of the market makers have even been involved in setting up accounts to help Workday employees sell their stock.  It's possible they have convinced a lot of holders of the previously locked-up stock to hold the stock and instead lock in the price via options.

At some point this stock needs to start moving out of VC and employee hands and into funds and retail.  When that will be, I don't know.

As I said in my original post, it might be June before we see the bubble start to deflate.  Just thought I would share the picture of the landscape that the options market is showing.  I will probably add to my short position at $64 and above.

I have a close out target of $52 (although in the most rosy scenario from a fundamentals standpoint I think the stock is worth $40 or so, today).

My Dad complained that no one would buy a pencil for that price, but the man retorted “I only have to sell one.”

Geovax is one of several companies researching an AIDS vaccine.  The development of the first AIDS vaccine would be a boon to mankind and provide an incredible return to investors (speculators).  The search for an AIDS vaccine has been elusive and Geovax will likely fail if its search does not bear fruit.  There are other larger entities, such as Merck, pursuing an AIDS vaccine that may push Geovax’s candidate to the side.  Geovax may need additional funding to develop the vaccine and current stockholders may be diluted.  This is a very high risk / very high reward stock.

Geovax’s lead candidate is HVTN205.  HVTN 205 completed phase 2a trials “with our vaccines demonstrating an excellent safety profile and reproducible T cell and antibody immune responses.”  HVTN will next face a phase 2b trial to test its effectiveness.    To get to market Geovax would need to prove itself sufficiently safe and effective in the phase 2b trial and in a follow on phase 3 trial.  

I don’t have a good handle on the current status of Geovax’s competitors.  Certainly this information would be useful.

Geovax has 1.5 Million in cash as of 9/30/2012.  The company revenue is based on government grants and has access to 3.7Million in remaining grant funds.  The company lost $375,000 in the most recent quarter.  This gives Geovax about a year’s worth of cash at its current burn rate.  It seems likely Geovax would pursue a private placement deal similar to the one it completed in March of 2012.  
Details available at:  http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/GOVX.PK/key-developments/article/2504272 

I really have no idea how much revenue an AIDS vaccine would produce, but it seems like it would have to be an incredible amount.  The stock has less than 20M shares at a market cap of about 15 Million.  This stock could really move on positive news.  

The company has a product that is a potential boon to mankind.  The company faces stiff competition in the development of its product and may fail to develop a working vaccine.  The company has a low number of shares and a low market cap.  If you want to speculate, here’s one to look at.

More TVs are starting to have Apps on them which includes Netflix and Blockbuster. This makes a new market place for them to compete

More people are getting these TVs and more people are getting highspeed internet and substituting internet for cable. 

Will Blockbuster's Total Access offer more in the end?
What you do you like about Blockbuster that isn't offered by Netflix?

I personally like the pay-per-view aspect of Blockbuster but how can I can seriously justify their prices when Netflix clearly offers better value for my dollar?

I know all the basics like not investing in something that doesn't make sense and to never invest money that you can't afford to lose. One thing that has always confused me is the whole dividend paying thing. I understand that if you buy stocks you get paid your share of the profit depending on how many stocks you have. 

[According to Google](http://www.google.com/finance?q=activision&amp;hl=en) Activision stock trades at about 13 and pays 1.28 a year. Which means I'd have to wait a little over 10 years to see a profit. Is this correct? That just sounds so insane to me. Maybe I'm missing something. I don't know.

Now unless I'm doing the mathematics very very wrong, the market cap currently is 2,990,720,000 yen, which equates roughly to $30,000,000 US. Sounds like a lot of money, right?

Keep in mind, Zenimax raised 105,000,000 USD to buy ID entertainment who had at the time 8 different IPs with something like 20 different games and did not even self publish most of them, and Activision and EA spend close to 100,000,000 USD each year on marketting for their biggest franchise (battlefield and call of duty respectively).

Whereas NIS has publishes their own games on two separate continents, are ramping up to break into the PC market, have an extremely loyal fanbase, and a lot of their games would be aces in the mobile market, as well as the fact that they are continually generating new IPs, and that isn't even getting into the other medias that they publish (Anime and Manga).  For $30,000,000.

Now either I am missing something on a very fundamental level or all the big publishing company's (EA, Activision, Zenimax, Bandai Namco, Konami, Square Enix, 2K Games, Wargaming Inc, Capcom, Microsoft, a few others) are passing up a very good opportunity to expand their portfolio.

Finding ideas from stock screens simply doesn't cut it in my opinion.

I've been trading stocks since November 2011.  One of the things that sticks out in my mind in determining success is having a compelling thesis behind stock trades.

A couple of preface notes: I don't subscribe to charting, and although I know some people swear by it, I'd like to keep the discussion around fundamentals/business.  Also, I would like discussion to stay away from penny stocks as the risk/reward leans heavily towards risk in my view.

I was thinking we could get some discussion going in /r/stocks and people could post their best thesis (or theses) and we could discuss/critique/etc.  

I'll go ahead and start with mine, and I'm hoping others will want to share theirs as well.  At the end of the day the institutions control the market and I don't think Goldman Sachs is trolling reddit for stock thesis ideas (but hell you never know).

One of the other problems I have when making my thesis, is that when I sit down and think some up, and then do follow-up research I often find I am 6-8 months behind the point when I would have needed to come up with the idea.  From my perspective you have to be way ahead of the institutions on thesis ideas, because they are doing this stuff day in and day out.  

The other thing that boggles my mind is that current performance means nothing as compared to projected future performance.  A company can have a blowout quarter but if a new future projection is below the old future projection the stock will drop.

Warning: I'm going to list tickers here.  I'm not trying to pump my ideas, but I feel specifics are required in some of these cases.  Disclosures at the bottoms of the post.

Thesis #1: Ballast Water Treatment

I got this idea from a citigroup slide deck a few months back and [I think I] missed the boat on a semi-pure play on ballast water treatment - Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC).  Basically in shipping, when container ships/tankers/etc. come into port they have to discharge ballast water and vice versa when leaving port.  All kinds of marine life gets sucked into the ballast water and it's become a huge problem around the world with invasive species.  So apparently ships built in the US in 2014 or later will be required to treat the ballast water, and there are a variety of options to do so.  The US market isn't really what matters though; the most ships fly Panamanian flags.  Panama is essentially waiting on the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to mandate it for member countries and then most of the shipping fleet will fall into place.

Thesis#2: Water in general

I haven't had the balls to put money on the line on this thesis yet because it may be a value trap.  The thesis is, what everyone already knows, that basically water supplies around the world are becoming scarce/contaminated/strained.  The question is what is when will the sector pick up.  It's more a gradual, long-term play.  In general I don't consider an investment worthy if it doesn't generate ""alpha"" or gains above what the money would have gained in an index fund.
Possible tickers are: CCC, PLL, DHR, XYL, ERII, MWG, ITT, WTR, FLS, NLC, VE, PHO, ZWI, DJUSWU, PIO, AWK, PIIWI, CGW, AND, SBS, NWPX

Thesis #3: Commercial Airline Derivative Plays

I know, I know, I'm WAY late on this thesis.  Really I'm looking for derivative plays off the new Dreamliner and Airbus programs.  I brought shares of Hexcell after the recent conference call.  HXL makes the carbon fiber which makes up the structures of the new planes.  Basically the airline business is all about weight shedding to save fuel, and carbon fiber is the best way to do that and maintain the rigid structure required on airplanes.  I'm pretty late on this play as evidenced by the gap-up in the stock but I'm hoping that as the Airbus program rolls out the company will keep expanding as it has for the Boeing program.

The new automobile CAFE (fuel efficiency) standards which Obama signed into law this year may also have an effect. Slides I've seen from a GM presentation say that the $/lb must come down for carbon fiber, and until then aluminum is a more cost effective option for common passenger vehicles.
Possible tickers: HXL, ZOLT, CYT, Toray Industries (3402), HRS, HEI, HON, UTX, PCP, AIR, TGI, TXT

Thesis #4 - E-coupons

RetailMeNot (ticker:SALE) IPO'd last week and is the only publicly traded one out there right now.  I'm going to wait a quarter or two to see what the price does, as I don't want to get Grouponed or Facebooked.  I'm predicting E-coupons are the way of the future and coupon clipping will be dead in a decade.

I'll leave it at that for now.  Other thesis possibilities I have but haven't pulled the trigger and are late on are: Big Data (way late), 3-D Printing (overhyped), and The Comeback of Europe (I think it's bottomed, may pull the trigger on this via an ETF).

Disclosures: 
Currently: Long: NXPI (+96%), MAKO (-62%), HXL (-1%); 
Recently sold: Long: CELG (+89%), SRE (+38%), PM (+18%), SWHC (+1%)

I am new to stocks and after much research I decided to buy Autodesk.

I bought their stock a few days after May 16th. On May 16th Autodesk issued a Q2 2014 Guidance that were below analysts' estimates. Their stock price sharply decreased after that announcement, but then stabilized from May 20-May 30. I bought during this period thinking the dip from the Q2 2014 Guidance had passed and was accounted for in the stock price.

However, the price keeps going down. Not sure whether to sell or not.

Does the price of a stock effect your stock pick?

I don't understand the difference.  Holding 10 shares of a $100 stock is the same holding as 100 shares of a $10 stock. Through my broker, I still get charged a flat fee for trading either 10 shares or 100 shares... it makes no difference.

I have about 1600 bucks in a few different stocks. I had used a christmas bonus about 4 years ago and just wanted to play around.

1600 bucks is miniscule I'm sure to some of you. I am finding that it would be nice to pay off a credit card or something. However there is this nagging itch in my head that is worried that the second I sell them, up they go! This happened to me with netflix. I bought about 10 shares when it was like 40 bucks a few years ago. The stock jumped up to almost 200 and I was thinking it would keep going. Then it sank to about 70 so I sold it. Well, now its back up again. Yes I know its the nature of the beast but I'm looking for a more informed opinion on whether I should just dump them all and be done with it.

I have stocks in:

Cypress Semiconductor (11.4 shares)

Facebook (1 share)

General Electric (17.23 shares)

NVidia (20.11 shares)

Suntech Power (35.70 shares)

Alcoa (89.97 shares)

My biggest fear is Alcoa. As I was playing with the stock market (and honestly not entirely understanding it) I wanted to invest in companies I believed in. I feel that Alcoa (or it's industry) is something that will some day be worth something. But again, I could just use the money instead. 

Would you guys hold on just for the hell of it? or is this just chump change that would be better off used on something else?

We are developing a web application that aims to help serious investors manage their portfolios and perform equities research in more efficient ways than the tools that are currently available.

Because we are very interested in getting feedback from first time users, I'm not going to reveal the name of our company or product since those are very easily searchable as the product is in public beta and free to access right now.

It should take about an hour or so and will be done via screen capture using gotomeeting with a mic (or over the phone if you don't have a mic). We can't offer you any monetary incentive in return, but in return for your time we'll provide you with a limited free use of the app once it exits beta.

Yet despite promising research results, shares have wound down to around 3.15 over the last couple days. This confuses me, and I'm quickly realizing I shouldn't've bought a stock I understand this poorly, and I'm thinking I should jump ship in case it's headed toward sub-$2 52wk lows. Advice?

Edit: Thanks for the comments. I decided last night I'm going to sell if it passes yesterday's low of 3.05, but I watched it stall at 3.07 this morning and rise consistently since then (now at 3.22), testing new ceilings and setting floors every few cents. Should I set a stop loss limit? I don't like the ideal of selling at a low for such a volatile stock, considering how the previous day's lows tend to be tested and bounced off of, and I still want to believe that the positive drug tests reported recently are going to pay off... but maybe until I understand pharmaceuticals better I should sit this one out and take comfort in my long term tech investments. Sigh... I should have done a lot more paper trading before trying something like this, and learned more about selling than I did about buying, considering that's the hard part.

The market wandered along all day barely moving and once the FED made their statement which just sounded quite gloomy, the market decided to dive 80 points pretty quickly.  Very bad sign, there is more downside to come.

On top of that, oil jumped.  That is pretty counter-intuitive as well, but not in today's trader market.  Even though there is supposed to be less demand, the price of oil went up.  How is that?  Well speculators are jumping back in commodities for safety and because it is pretty inevitable that Greece is going to default at some level which will cause other European coutries to have to bail them out or at least the Greek banks and that will lower the value of European currencies which will cause US dollar to increase in value.  What happens when dollar strengthens in last couple years?  Commodities rise.  Higher oil compounds the issues because it pinches the consumer which inhibits any kind of growth.  I wrote about how my target price for oil was $85 or lower in order for the market to go up.  I have not left that thesis.

Ok, now that I have discussed why I think the overall market is going to go lower, let me add on my thesis on Netflix, and why I think it is a good short.  Netflix is a growth stock, doubling and doubling again in the last couple years.  Now any signal of slower growth, and the P/E multiple compresses.  Netflix has a P/E in the 70's for this year and in the high 30's for a forward P/E ratio.  In order to maintain those ratios the company needs to still grow quickly and this becomes much more difficult with the addition of stronger competition.  This is exactly what happened today with the announcement by HULU that it was hiring Morgan Stanley to help advise on putting itself up for sale in the market.  This means that they either are out of cash and need someone to come in and pay there bills which most likely would be a Netflix buyer; or they are seeing too much pressure in the future by the big boys like Amazon and Apple.  Either way this is going to be represented as bad news for Netflix as sellers are looking for any excuse to take profits and get spooked.

During the early morning it posted a high of 211.30 which is the all time high for the stock.

NFLX was fueled by a strong earnings report which revealed a total growth of 7.7 million users in 2010, and a total number of users surpassing 20 million. Early estimates in 2010 predicted that NFLX's user base would grow by merely 3.6 million users, however, the results were more than double those figures. The company reported  that earnings increased by 52% to $47.1 million and that revenue increased 34% to $595.9 million. 

The future for NFLX seems extremely bright as they continue to capture more and more users. Newer features such as instant streaming (hopefully more movies will be available for streaming) continue to propel the stock price and user base higher. 

My prediction: This stock will reach the mid $200 level by year's end. I feel that in the time being it will set a nice support level around the 200-210 level and then continue in its pursuit to the upside.

1294000041.0,6,self.stocks,ev240,I'm staring a website for alternative stock researching methods and would like to use /r/stocks as a sounding board and possibly get some more ideas,6,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ev240/im_staring_a_website_for_alternative_stock/,"I've been working on this site for a while in my head and finally started making it about 7 months ago.  It is coming along really nice but I wanted to get some outside perspective and possibly some ideas for what other info people might want.  If I do end up using anyone's idea I plan on giving them a free account for a year or so.

So what I mean by alternative stock researching is I don't want to just provide the same old stuff Google Finance and Yahoo Finance have.  I figure anyone can just go look there.  I will have that data but I'm not expecting people to pay me for it.

Anyway here is a list of what my program currently does

1.  Background checks on the Executives of a Company.  If the CEO has a DUI or is going through a divorce it could effect his concentration.

2.  How many Jobs they are hiring and what kind they are hiring for.  Figure if they are hiring that means they are expanding.

3.  Patent searches - this is kind of hit or miss right now but I'm hoping to figure a way to make it more exacting.  You'll get to see what patents the company are applying for.  The weird thing about this is it sometimes can royally screw up.  For example finding patents by Ford is really easy however people love to use Walt Disney company as an example so you get a bunch of patents unrelated to them.

4. Sentiments analysis of twitter, news articles, annual reports, and stock holder calls.  This pretty much means I'm going to try to tell you if they are positive or negative.  Going to also try to pull out themes kind of like a tag map.

5. Monitor their domain registration.  Try to figure out what domains they own.  If they register a new one that isn't being used that could mean a new product.

6. Monitor their online marketing.  What kind of page rank do their domains have with the search engines.  How many back links do their pages have.  What are the key words they are paying for in ads and how much are they paying.

7.  Reviews on how their employees think the company is doing on a variety of issues.  Also an overall score of their confidence in the CEO.  I wouldn't invest in a place where the workers think the CEO is a moron.  Also see how hard the interview process is.

I think this information does tend to skew to research on companies who have a big online presence and need that to make money.  However I think more and more companies have to at least make themselves known online.  Also I think the marketing data specifically is really interesting when you compare it to a company's competitors.

If you have any more ideas for what kind of data I can collect remember I'll give you free access to the service for a year if I end up using it which is a big thing since a lot of the places I'm getting the data from cost money.  It will probably be limited to the lowest tier though for the same reason.  I'd be willing to negotiate a higher tier if the idea is really good.

Right now the pricing I think is going to be tiered where at the lowest end you can track like 10 companies a month for a nominal fee tied into how much the data sources I use end up costing.  I update most of the data daily but you can't keep switching companies since some of the data like the background checks cost more and is unlikely to change day to day.  After 30 days then you can switch that slot.

I'm also going to offer credit if you fix the data I provide.  For example my script to find twitter users for a company uses a lot of guess work so if you provide twitter users I miss or report one that is a mistake it will give you some additional time.  That way I figure some power users will be able to use the service, even at the higher tiers, pretty much for free just by contributing to the quality of the data.  Just the nature of the beast is that I can't always guarantee the quality of all the data since the service is mainly automated so I will be looking for people to help with the quality control.

If you know of any competitors out there I'd be interested in seeing what other people are doing.  This site isn't ever going to straight up recommend stocks so I'm not sure those kind of sites would be my competitors.

Anyway let me know what you think.  Of coarse when I do finally go to beta I will be posting back there to let you guys try out the service.  It will be a free beta but I'm not sure how long it will last.  It depends on how much money I can get initially and what the data sources I use end up costing.",,False,,t5_2qjfk,True,,,True,t3_ev240,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ev240/im_staring_a_website_for_alternative_stock/,

WASHINGTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department sued on Tuesday to block the merger of American Airlines' parent company AMR Corp and US Airways Group Inc, saying the deal would hurt consumers by leading to higher fares and fees.
The $11 billion merger would create the world's largest airline. The civil antitrust lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The Justice Department was joined in its suit by several states, among them Arizona and Texas.
""The department sued to block this merger because it would eliminate competition between US Airways and American and put consumers at risk of higher prices and reduced service,"" Bill Baer, head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division, said in a statement.
""Both airlines have stated they can succeed on a standalone basis, and consumers deserve the benefit of that continuing competitive dynamic,"" Baer said.
AMR and US Airways did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suit.
The two airlines secured European Union approval for the proposed merger on Aug. 5 after promising to surrender slots at two airports, London's Heathrow and Philadelphia in the United States.
The Justice Department said it was concerned that if the merger went through, four airlines would control more than 80 percent of the U.S. commercial air travel market.
Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, the facility closest to Washington, would see especially high concentration as the combined company would control 69 percent of the take-off and landing slots, the department said.",,False,,t5_2qjfk,False,,,True,t3_1ka8mf,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ka8mf/aamrq_dropped_due_to_potential_lawsuit_by_the/,

1362002647.0,4,self.stocks,19crph,Reed's Inc. (REED); An Analysis,5,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19crph/reeds_inc_reed_an_analysis/,"I stumbled upon REED several months ago, and put them on my watch list.  To give a quick break down, they sell soft drinks and ginger drinks/candies, and also have a private label business.  They have products in mostly places like Whole Foods and Trader Joes.  Products in 13,000 stores nationwide.  I believe it's dropped low enough that it is well worth a buy.  It seems to me to be oversold and has lots of growth potential.  I unfortunately bought it right before it's dropped 15%, but I bought more to average down, so I'll be okay.

**Pros**

* Annual revenue growth for the past 3 years  [seen here from Google Finance](http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSEAMEX%3AREED&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=FF8uUbCNIKWyiQKKWA)

* Looking at the trendline, due to be come profitable this year

* Increased 2012 revenue 20% compared to TTM [article seen here](http://www.bevnet.com/news/2013/fueled-by-kombucha-reeds-inc-continues-growth), from $25 mil to $30 mil

* Anecdotal: I liked their product, it was delicious

* We seem to still be in the ""health craze"" cycle that's taken over the country in the past decade.  Their line of Kombucha drinks has touted a lout of healthy benefits, leading to them selling 750,000 bottles in 2012.

*  The Reed family holds several positions in the company and they hold a LARGE majority of shares.  They seem to be personally invested in the company.


* Has grown with basically no marketing.  They recently paired up with Snoop Lion, formerly known as Snoop Dogg, to promote their product on Twitter, seen [here](https://twitter.com/reedsgingerbrew)

**Cons**

* A large majority of their profits came from the success from their Kombucha line of drinks.  Their business is split into 3 divisions: Kombucha, private label, and other drinks.  The owner even stated that they relied heavily on the Kombucha line, stating ""In many cases, the sales of Kombucha in stores sold more than all other products combined.""  Will their other products begin to grow at the same rate?  Will Kombucha line continue to grow?  Can they ramp up production to meet growing demands?

* Their website looks like it was made by a 12 year old.  Although other social websites look more professional.

* When can investors start seeing profits?

So, that's my analysis of REED.  I would appreciate any insight and comments on the subject.",,False,,t5_2qjfk,False,,,True,t3_19crph,http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19crph/reeds_inc_reed_an_analysis/,

1. Where should I start with regards to ""due diligence""? I feel that since this is a speculative play, I would have to look at trial result history as well as cash on hand to fund current/future trials/operations, for example. 

2. What is the bullish case for this stock? Does it really have the potential to ""explode"" and reach over $10.00 per share?
