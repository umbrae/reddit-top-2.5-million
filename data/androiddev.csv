How to make people want to continue playing/listening/watching/reading/... fascinates me immensely though

I hope it's useful for at least some people :)

Almost all my questions were answered by stackexchange (thank god for stackexchange, seriously), and the main tutorial I used was http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/06/android-game-development-tutorials.html http://www.kilobolt.com/tutorials.html, very good stuff for beginners.

1369593420.0,146,self.androiddev,1f3cma,"I have 1.2 million downloads, here are some tips I've noticed with android games",174,28,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1f3cma/i_have_12_million_downloads_here_are_some_tips/,"Even the best game/app will flop if you don't manage it well. Here are some things I've noticed over the past year of creating / managing my apps.

- The biggest thing is make sure the app is fun to play. If you don't find the game fun neither will your users.

- Don't release an app before you're done with it. If you're like me you tend you rush the final stages of the app to get it to market soon, don't do this. Take an extra week or so to polish off all the rough edges of your app

- Try to keep the filesize below 25mb if possible. I've found that going above this mark limits the number of downloads. In a perfect world you would want to be around 5mb but that isn't always possible. Going too small though (&lt;1.5mb) can actually lower downloads too as users start to think that such a small app can't be too high quality

- Use some kind of worldwide leaderboard. You can make your own or use a 3rd party but people love to compete against one another. You just took a decent game and made it a good game

- Create a good looking icon, but don't assume it's the best you can do. You should keep track of your download numbers over the course of 1-2 weeks and then try a new icon for the same time period. Keep track of which one does the best. I would try at least 5 icons the more the better though. Developers almost never do this and they are ripping themselves off. Using this method I was able to increase my daily downloads over 100% across all my apps.

- Fill out every line in the ""STORE LISTING"" section off your app. I've personally found that by filling out every form field that it boosted my apps up quite a bit in the rankings. It could be a fluke...but hey it;s not that hard to fill out a few extra form fields and add some new screenshots for a chance that it works out.

- Incentivise ratings of your app but only after 4 times playing the app. If the user has played your game 4 times they probably like it so show a popup asking them to rate your app. In exchange you will give them some cool feature in your game. Doing so will encourage them to rate your app and since they like it they will probably rate it high. I only ever show 1 popup. Once the user closes it I never bug them again. 

- Fake it till you make it - Using services like getjar or appbrain to advertise your app will drive instant traffic to your app. If you spend 100$ on launch day it should boost your app into google's trending list. Once in trending you should see 1-2k downloads per day while in there. Once you fall out of tending you can use the same method to get in there again. This will cost some money, but you sometimes have to spend a little to make a lot

- Read your competitors comments and figure out what people like and what they don't like and create your app around these comments

- Offer in app purchases that don't force the users to have to buy them but it will enhance the users gameplay. For example if you have a sword and it does 10 damage maybe the in app purchase can be for a better sword that does 20 damage. 

- Don't be afraid of ads instead of paid apps. I've made close to 5,000% more off of ads then I have my paid apps. People download free games like crazy and every time they play the game you get paid. 


EDIT: MORE TIPS

- With the app icon even though you upload a 512x512 icon it's never seen at that resolution. On most devices it's seen much much smaller. I would make sure before uploading your icon you view it at 80x80 and make sure it still looks good. Most older devices will see your icon around this size.

- Submit your app to all the android app review sites. There are a bunch of them and most of them offer free versions. It may take a few weeks to get on the site, but hey it's free publicity for you. 

- Pick your 1 main keyword or phrase you want to target for your app and make sure you place it in your app title as well as in the app description.

- If you have a paid app and it's $0.99 raise the app to $1.99. Google released a good marketing video for the app store a few months back talking about how raising the price almost always brought in more downloads and revenue. They said people associate $0.99 apps to be cheap quality and would rather pay 1$ more for a higher quality app. They said not only that but you can drop the price by 1$ for a sale but if it's at $0.99 you can never drop the price

If you do some of these you should have a decent chance of making some decent money. If you do all of them you should have a really good chance. Keep in mind though that not every app makes it and sometimes you have to cut your losses with the app and create a new one.",,False,,t5_2r26y,1369618152.0,,,True,t3_1f3cma,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1f3cma/i_have_12_million_downloads_here_are_some_tips/,

Hi there!
For this first tutorial I think I will start off with a brief overview of 1. The different ways to develop for the Android system, and 2. The main workflow for an Android application.

So, jumping right into it, there are two main ways to develop for the Android system, they are the Android **SDK** and the Android **NDK**. SDK stands for *Software* Development Kit and NDK stands for *Native* Development Kit. The difference between the two is that the SDK is used to program Android applications in Java while using (mostly) Android specific packages, while the NDK is used to program directly for the phone's processor using native-code languages (C and C++). 

The SDK is what most applications are based on, it's the easiest way to program and has a lot more documentation. Applications programed in Java however, have to rely on using the Dalvik Virtual Machine, which is best described as a translator between your code and the processor itself. Think of this this way: If you program using the NDK you are programming something that the processor can directly understand, while if you program using the SDK you are making something that only the Dalvik VM can understand and that in turn has to translate all your code into a language the processor can understand. It's as if you are programming in Dutch but the processor only speaks English.

The NDK is typically only used in CPU-intensive applications and the most common case for it is to create direct OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) code to display 3D models. You have OpenGL wrappers available to you in the Android SDK but these act slower than directly coding in the NDK due to having to be translated by the Dalvik VM. The NDK as I said previously is much harder to program for, but it is a godsend for people who have OpenGL games on other platforms and want to translate it over to the Android system because they don't have to rewrite all their (typically C/C++) code into Java.

Please keep in mind that you can not solely create an application using the NDK, if you use the NDK you still need to create a front-end to your application using the SDK. Meaning you will have an application that displays the user interface and then calls on your NDK program to do the rest.

Almost all these tutorials will focus on the SDK, in fact, my C is so ugly that I might not even make any NDK tutorials. If anyone wants to do those at a later time, please feel free to do so.

That was a lot to go through at once so if you don't understand some of it, don't worry, it'll come up again later.

 

Now, in the last post I told you to follow the [official Android tutorial](http://d.android.com/sdk/installing.html) to setting up your Eclipse / Android workspace. If you have had any problems with this guide comment so and I will help you through it.

The site that has the last guide is the official Android developers website and it is amazing. Learn to love it.

One of the steps in that last guide shows you how to set up your ""Hello, World"" application. Using that application let's go through line-by-line and learn what's going on and how the Android lifecycle works. Here's a [handy little picture](http://d.android.com/images/activity_lifecycle.png) from the Developer site that demonstrates the lifecycle through a flowchart. Let's first go through the ""Construct the UI"" portion of that page because it's simpler than the other method.

    package com.android.helloandroid;
    
    import android.app.Activity;
    import android.os.Bundle;
    import android.widget.TextView;
    
    public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {
        /** Called when the activity is first created. */
        @Override
        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            TextView tv = new TextView(this);
            tv.setText(""Hello, Android"");
            setContentView(tv);
        }
    }

I'm going to ignore the import lines because Eclipse will take care of those automatically if you hit Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+O.

Line 7: 
    public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {

tells the VM that you are creating a *class* called HelloAndroid and that it *extends* the class Activity. This means that you are creating an complicated object that has different methods and variables you are calling HelloAndroid and that is it a subsect of the bigger class Activity. Activity's lifecycle was demonstrated in the picture linked earlier.


Line 9:
    @Override
this tells the VM that you are about to create a method and that this method will *override* a parent method. In this case, you are creating your own implementation of the onCreate method from the class Activity, and you are going to replace the default onCreate with your own. Because we are only overriding the onCreate method Android will automatically take care of all the other parts of the lifecycle that we are doing nothing about.


Line 10:
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
I should've probably mixed this in with the last line. But then again, this is a very important line. This is the method where all the magic happens, baby! You are creating a *public* (as in, your other files can see it), *void* (as in, it doesn't return any value when it's done) method called **onCreate**. Your method is also receiving a *Bundle* of information when it opens. This will be empty right now but if you had another Activity in your program you could call it from this Activity and pass along a Bundle of data to it. 


Line 11:
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
Every time you override a method you have to first have to call the the super class. This tells the system that you are in the onCreate portion of your application. If you ever forget to do this the VM will be nice enough to output to the log ""missing super call"" and then crash your application.


Line 12:
    TextView tv = new TextView(this);
You are creating a [TextView](http://d.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html) object and you are calling it tv. The TextView is being created with *this* (your application) as it's parent.


Line 13:
    tv.setText(""Hello, Android"");
If you clicked the link for the last line you saw all the different methods the TextView object has. In this line you are telling your TextView, tv, to set it's text to ""Hello, Android"".


Line 14:
    setContentView(tv);
Perhaps this line would be easier to understand if you put an (unnecessary) *this* in front of it, changing the line to:
    this.setContentView(tv);
In this line you are telling your Activity that the [view](http://d.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html) it displays to the user is your TextView called tv. TextView, by definition, extends the View class so it can be used in this case even though it says setContentView and not setContentTextView.

 

Bam. Have you tried running this application yet? Either in the Virtual phone that ships with the Android SDK or your phone? (If you want to run this on your phone you'll need to enable ""USB Debugging"" in the settings of your phone.) Did you run it? Isn't it great? Note that if you click the ""home"" or ""back"" button on your phone, it automatically calls Activity.onPause() and sends your application to the background. It does this even though you didn't Override the method and tell your application to this. This is because you extended the class *Activity* which has default actions for things that can happen in your application.

Aren't you proud of yourself? You should be. I feel like this is a huge first tutorial already so we won't discuss displaying your application via an XML Layout, but if you want to, feel free to follow the rest of the Hello, World tutorial on the Android website to see how that's done. We'll go over it next time.

If Android Studio is your first IDE for Android development, how intuitive has your experience been?  If you switched from Eclipse, how do you compare the two?

I migrated one of my applications from Eclipse to test the new IDE and couldn't find any major issues with it.  Since then I have migrated all of my applications and have yet to reopen Eclipse.  In my experience Android Studio starts slightly faster than Eclipse, although I had a number of non-Android plugins installed which may have contributed to that.

Testing applications (clicking ""Run"") seems to take roughly the same amount of time.  Generating a signed .APK file takes half the time it did in Eclipse, which is very nice as I have to release multiple variations of the same application.  Auto completion/quick fix is slightly more helpful in Android Studio.  For instance, when I create a new OnClickListener, the listener is generated with the onClick() function already in place.  In Eclipse, adding ""un-implemented methods"" required a second step.

I haven't explored the entire IDE yet, but so far my only issue is with Activity creation.  In Eclipse, creating an Activity would not only create the class, but the resource (.xml) files as well.  Android Studio creates a blank class for the activity and adds it to AndroidManifest.xml

No more ad money. I did nothing to increase my own traffic. I literally just sat back and collected a check. For whatever reason they decided I should no longer get paid.

--
At some point in time, Linux users/devs were fed up with the constant cluttering of their home-folder, that they created the XDG basedir spec[0]. While on the desktop/notebook I can live with the mess that are dotfiles, since by default all major filemanager hide them from your view until requested, I can not live with this on my phones ""sd-card"".

I usually don't mess with your files in your apps data-dir, so go crazy there, please don't do that in the space where I'm trying to organize my photos, music, ...

Quite a lot of widely used apps don't even let me choose the folder used for backups or additionally downloaded data. This clutters the view, accounts for excessive and unneeded scrolling and generally makes all processes involving file management a more time consuming task and also makes it harder to create custom backup scripts.

So please, I ask you kindly to clean up. Since the XDG spec already exists for the desktop, I'd be ok with just using that. I know, that not all filesystems in use, espacially FAT-XX, support hidden folders, I could live with visible folders as long as they are organized.

So please, drop your files in /{sdcard-path}/[.]{config,local,data}/yourapphere/stuff or at the very least, let me choose my own folder structure by giving me the chance to configure your storage paths.

Thanks.

I went through about 50 lessons at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUOWNXGRc6g starting last Wednesday.  By this past Tuesday, I felt I had learned enough and went ahead and developed a very simple app that I eventually published in about two days.

SOME OF MY BACKGROUND:

- I did take some basic courses in Java back in college, about two classes, but that was back in 2001.

- I'm fairly practiced in the ""copy and paste"" methodologies and Googling concepts for HTML, CSS, for various Wordpress Blogs I maintain.

Even if you're not as ""tech savvy"" as I am, I believe that you could develop your own app and publish it within a month if you have enough diligence and are willing to push yourself.

I'd actually say developing Android apps is MUCH easier than trying to develop straight Java.  I was thinking I'd have to learn Java before learning to develop for Android, but I think I saved myself TONS of headache by jumping straight in.

Android has a bunch of build in libraries that essentially speed up the development process and ease the learning curve!

I think I'd get more discouraged if I tried to develop a GUI for Android strictly using Java commands.  Using the XML instead makes things a lot easier (for a newb like me).

Anyway, now that I saw that developing isn't impossible (thanks to StackOverflow, reference libraries, etc :) ), I see that it's more about how much time I actually want to invest in developing apps.

Hi there!

In the previous post we left off right as the Android [Hello World Tutorial](http://d.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html#upgrading) got to the layout portion. So, let's start off there.

Your android application contains many folders (which you can see on the left-side of Eclipse). You have these folders: *src/*, *res/* and *gen/*.  src/ is the folder in which your source code resides. res/ is the folder in which all your static files (layouts, images, values) reside. gen/ is a folder which you will never have to touch, it has one very magical file in it called R.java, R is a file that is automatically updated each time you put something in the res/ folder and it is the link between your code and the static files. For example, if you have a layout .xml file called ""main_layout.xml"" you can use it by using the variable R.layout.main_layout.

Now, with that in mind, let's look at the XML code in the Android tutorial.


    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
    &lt;TextView xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        android:id=""@+id/textview""
        android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
        android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
        android:text=""@string/hello""/&gt;

So, what does this do? Well, the first line defines this as a utf-8 encoded XML file. The only object in this layout is a TextView (which you are familiar with from the last tutorial). This TextView is automatically sized to fill in the parent object, this means that if this TextView is the only thing in an application it will automatically enlarge to fill the entire screen.

The id of this TextView is set as ""@+id/textview"", you the @id simply means that this is an id and the + means that we are creating this for our own use, it is not a standard Android id. This line allows us to refer to this TextView from our code by using R.id.textview.

And finally, the text inside of our TextView is defined as ""@string/hello"" this means that in the file strings.xml (which should reside in res/values/) we have an object named ""hello"" and we want to use that object's value as out text.

Here's the contents of strings.xml:

    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
    &lt;resources&gt;
        &lt;string name=""hello""&gt;Hello, Android! I am a string resource!&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string name=""app_name""&gt;Hello, Android&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;

As you can see, we do have a string object named hello and the value is ""Hello, Android! I am a string resource"".

We tell our application to use this view by replacing the last three lines in our onCreate function from the previous post to:

    setContentView(R.layout.main);

See how much easier that is than creating the layout programatically? 

We could have also had more than one view in our defined layout. To do this, we need to use one of the container views the two most commonly used of which are [RelativeLayout](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RelativeLayout.html) and [LinearLayout](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/LinearLayout.html). If you are up for it, I'd like you to try to use a *LinearLayout* on your own to have two textviews in the application instead of the one.


We'll discuss that task later on next week, for now, on to more fun things.

First of all, Menus! By menus I don't mean a menu of buttons in your application, I mean what pops up when you hit the ""menu"" button on your phone. Remember last week when I was super excited about how you didn't need to explicitly tell your application what to do when someone hits the home or back buttons and how that was because the Activity class you are creating a child of has a bunch of functions built in? Well, adding a menu to your application is as simple as overriding two functions. First of all:

    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
        menu.add(0, UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER, 0, ""Dark Theme"");
        
        return true;
    }


We are overriding a function of the class Activity called onCreateOptionsMenu and what this function receives is a [Menu](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Menu.html) creatively called menu.

In our override we use the function menu.add() to add an item to the menu. menu.add() has four arguments. The first (in this case 0) is the group to which we want this item to exist in, for now always write this down as 0, we will go more in detail about it later. The second (in this case UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER) is a place holder for a unique number which you want established in the root of your class so that you can refer back to it in the other function we will override. The third is an integer that refers to the position of this item compared to other ones. The fourth argument is just the text of the item.


So far so good, right? Go ahead and try to add a few more items. I believe in you.


The second function we need to override goes:

    @Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        if(item.getItemId() == UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER) {
            // Do something.
        }
    }

The previous function was to add items to a menu before it gets displayed to the user, this one handles what happens when the user clicks on one of the items. The argument the function we're overriding receives relates to a [MenuItem](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MenuItem.html) which can tell us the id of the item hit.

Try to think of something to do with this button. The easiest thing to do in my opinion is to use the [Log](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html) class to send something out to logcat. This is done by:

    Log.i(""myTag"", ""Hey, someone clicked something!"");

Which can then be seen by either going to the Debugging perspective (Window --&gt; Open Perspective --&gt; Debug) and then look through the logcat tab. You can also do this by opening up a command line and typing ""adb logcat"". 

If you're a wild and crazy guy you could also consider defining the TextView used outside of your functions and using this menuitem to change it's text. You can get a handle on the TextView by adding this line to after your *setContentView()* function in onCreate:

    myTextView = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.textviewId);

Of course, replace *myTextView* with your variable's name and *textviewId* by the id of your textview as defined in the layout xml.



I was originally going to also discuss listviews in this tutorial but I feel like we just covered a lot and I'll leave listviews for a later tutorial.

I never gave much thought about validation until I did this enterprise application for one of my clients. The application had a dozen of forms will all kinds of validations, starting from required fields, regular expressions to server validations. And then validation became a pain in the neck and it was so annoying.

I tried googling for validation frameworks and there were a few which gave a *jump* start, however they were insufficient for complex validations or *forced* me to use their own **EditText** widgets. Being desperate and frustrated I began authoring this framework about 3 AM one day and in the next 3 hours ended up with something that was easy to use.

I posted it on [Github](https://github.com/ragunathjawahar/android-saripaar) (Yeah, licensed under Apache 2.0) and after receiving a suggestion from a developer on Stackoverflow I added annotations. Here are some of the examples that will clearly show you the difference when using traditional validation techniques and using the [Android Saripaar](https://github.com/ragunathjawahar/android-saripaar) UI validation library.

**Traditional - Required Field**

    String username = userNameEditText.getText().toString();
    int usernameLength = username.length();
    if (usernameLength == 0) {
            // Notify the user that username is required.
    } else if (usernameLength &lt; 3) {
           // Notify the user that username is too short.
    }


**Saripaar - Required Field**

    @Required(order = 1, messageResId = R.string.username_required)
    @TextRule(order = 2, minLength = 3, messageResId = R.string.username_too_short)
    private EditText usernameEditText;


**Saripaar - Email (Optional or Valid)**

    @Email(order = 1, messageResId = R.string.email_invalid)
    private EditText emailEditText;


**Saripaar - Email (Required and Valid)**

    @Required(order = 1, messageResId = R.string.email_required)
    @Email(order = 1, messageResId = R.string.email_invalid)
    private EditText emailEditText;


This is how concise your code could get when you use Saripaar and these examples just showcase the tip of the iceberg.

You can validate IP addresses, regular expressions, numbers, etc., Some of the salient features that improve productivity when you use [Android Saripaar](https://github.com/ragunathjawahar/android-saripaar) are,

    • Annotation support
    • Custom Rules
    • Complex Rules (And, Or, Composite And, Composite Or, etc.,)
    • Asynchronous validation (You don't have to worry about threading and AsyncTasks.,)
    • Rule only validation (If you are validating against a database or a network connection.,)


We use this extensively for our projects at [Mobs and Geeks](http://mobsandgeeks.com) and have achieved significant productivity in most of the projects.

[Saripaar](https://github.com/ragunathjawahar/android-saripaar) does a remarkable job of offloading the validation logic from your business logic thereby allowing to save a lot of time testing your code.

If you are someone who hates dependencies and has trouble with validations, give it a try.

In the settings you can define groups, they have a title, and a filename regex.
For example, a list of your activities would be named ""Activity"" and the filename regex matcher could be  "".\*Activity.\*""

If you organize your files consistently, this might save you lots of time.

Way better than distributing an apk manually to your testers. In case not all you are glued to GoogleIO videos, here's why it's great:

Advantages:

* All beta testers receive beta versions as **automatic upgrades**.

* _When_ the beta crashes, testers can **send crash reports** just like if it crashed in production. The reports and stack traces show up in the developer console.

Disadvantages.

* Like normal updates, it can take a few hours until everyone has received it.

Here's how you create a beta, or alpha, test in the play store:

1. You need to create a Google group or Google+ community **with your developer account** (make sure you're logged into the same gmail). I also have a Google+ Page, and creating the community with that did not work even though it is technically the same account.

2. In the play store, upload a beta apk. If you publish it straight from the beta-tab, it will be published in the beta test, not in production. You can at any time move an apk from being beta to production, back again, or remove it entirely.

3. In the beta tab, click *""Manage list of testers""*. Here you need to paste the URL to you community that you created before. Just copy it from your address bar.
At the bottom you find a special link that all your beta testers have to click. Publish this in you community or group.

The trick with the last link is that it only works if the user is already a member of you community/group. So tell them to join before clicking on it. It will lead them to a page with a warning and a big ""Become a beta tester"" button. Once they've joined, they will receive beta versions straight through the play store like normal updates.

So for example (**I am not fishing for testers**, just demonstrating):

If you have not joined my beta community [this testing link should be dead to you](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.nononsenseapps.notepad)

Whereas if you join the [community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/116491442198101285864), it works.

Also, an overly long postmortem.",71,21,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/nat6p/i_released_my_first_android_game_capricious/,"About a day or two ago, I released my first Android app onto the market. [Here it is, in all its glory. (i.e. none)](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.miles.android.circuit)


Anyway, I thought I’d write a little reflection/post mortem on the game and the development process. Wall of text incoming (by which I mean I’ve just spewed my thoughts onto the page without any regard to conciseness).

I started work on this game (Capricious Circuitry) a couple of months ago as a hobby, during my free time after school and weekends. I’d been thinking about making Android apps for a while before that, and I’d written down about 9 or 10 game ideas, of which I chose the one I thought would be easiest to make. Funny how the one I thought would be ‘easy’ was anything but.

The idea behind the game is you’ve got a bunch of power sources (which have a little sinusoidal curve on them – I think I was electricity in physics when I made that sprite), and you have to power a bunch of lightbulbs by routing the power through wires. The game is similar to both those games where you have to unscramble an image divided into blocks by swapping them around, and to a game called Cogs (actually, just looking at a video if it now, it’s eerily similar, more so than I thought). If that doesn’t help, [here’s a youtube video of a development version which should illustrate the idea well enough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39E09cRZU8M) (there’s also a bunch of other videos showing the development history of the app).

**What went wrong:**

1. The framework I created for dealing with different types of tiles was perhaps a bit too general and over-engineered. I created it with much more in mind than I actually used – I expected to include about 5 or 10 types of tiles, but all I really had were the power source tiles, the lightbulb tiles, wire tiles, and teleporter tiles. 

2. I found the Android layout system particularly arcane – I think I spent a large swath of time there trying to get it to do what I wanted. I think some of the problems stemmed from me not using any hardcoded widths or heights – only using fill_parent and wrap_content (which, I believe is what you are supposed to do). I think there are still problems with using hardcoded values, even if they are in dp, but I think creating several layouts for small, medium and large screens with hardcoded dp values might be preferable to the amount of time I spent fiddling around without using them. But then you also have the problem of, if you hardcode, say, a button to be 100 dp wide, even on the exact same device, if you switch locales, the translated text might overflow that 100 dp button. Getting stuff to be laid out correctly was probably my most frustrating experience with Android development. 

3. Since I’m only a programmer, not an artist, I decided to go with pixel art, because it’s something that I can sort of do (even though it’s still shit). However, I ran into a problem here with respect to how to scale it. My main game screen displays an NxN grid of tiles. This is scaled to be as large as it can.  Let’s assume I’m using GL_NEAREST scaling (that is, there is no averaging of pixel values – it will still look ‘pixelly’ and not blurred when scaled). The problem presents itself when I scale the board to a non-integer multiple. Straight lines will sometimes be thinner than other straight lines which should be the same. Other graphical fuck ups also appear, along the lines of what has already been mentioned. Now, I could only scale to an integer multiple, but that means the game view I present could be excessively small, hard to both read and manipulate on a touch screen. In this instance, I decided to bite the bullet and use GL_LINEAR scaling (on pixel art... the horror). I’d probably solve this by not using pixel art, or, by only using it in a game where I could just display more of the level, instead of scaling.

4. Tax stuff. Not much to say here. I wtf’d at what I was meant to put for what kind of tax I’m meant to charge on my donate version (so I just put ‘not charging any’). I live in Australia, so if anyone could advise me for what to actually put here, that’d be cool.

5. Switching between building the free version and the donate version. This is more of an annoyance than anything. I couldn’t find a good way to build both the donate version and the free version – that is, I’d have to rename a bunch of packages using Refactor-&gt;Rename in Eclipse and change a couple of other things to build my donate version (since if the package name is the same, the Android market considers it to be the same app). I did have two git branches, one for donate and one for free, I couldn’t figure out a good way to sync changes across them. In future, I’ll probably just write a script to this shit for me.

**What went right:**
First app, so there’s quite a bit less here than in the previous section.

1. The level creation process. It’s actually really easy to create levels the way I did it. You create a solved level in a map editor (specifically a program called Tiled). Then it goes through a bunch of scripts which convert the .tmx file produced by Tiled into a format my app understands. Then, using the infrastructure I’d already coded for use in my game (this actually required a little bit of refactoring to completely separate my model for my board from all android related classes – wasn’t that hard, as I was already using the MVC pattern for my game board), reads in the solved level, and then scrambles it. Although, I did this in a pretty retarded way, since I couldn’t be bothered thinking. Essentially, I scrambled the solved board by swapping a random tile and not revisiting any previous states for about 1000 iterations. Then I used a stupid bruteforce to solve it (was just a BFS – I thought about it for about 10 minutes, thought if I’d made the specification for what tiles are allowed less general, then I could actually make some observations and maybe get a dp for solving it in O(not shit) time) in a minimum amount of moves. I repeated that process about 20 or 30 times and chose the scrambled board which took the most amount of moves to solve. (my thinking here is that the larger the number of moves required to solve, the harder it is – not necessarily true). 


2. It got finished. Possibly the best thing that went right. It actually got done. Pretty much my first ‘non trivial’ (well, relatively) program to be actually done and released. Feels good man.

3. Error reporting. Possibly the most useful last minute addition I thought of. Looking back, I don’t know how I could have lived without it, or what would have happened if I didn’t put it in. I used ACRA (great error reporting framework, very easy to set up and get working). It sends me a full stacktrace a bunch of extra information, and some custom information I added, every time my app crashes. In the first day, I was able to fix 2 bugs just from the information gleaned from these error reports.

**The release:**
More nerve-wracking than I thought it would be. A few minutes after I uploaded, a friend told me that my app would only assume the portrait position on his phone, despite how the previous, non market versions, had run in landscape. Weird, I thought. But it’s quite difficult to debug something that weird, especially with no way to reproduce it, so I just decided to allow the app to go both ways (lol), that is, to be freely orientable by the user in any direction.

The next bug after that was users clicking ‘next’ after completing the last level. A surprising amount of reports came in from ACRA about this. I guess it’s because I said that the game was hard (truly, it is. It kicked my ass and I wasn’t even 30% of the way through the game), so they decided, well, let’s try the hardest level (which wasn’t actually the hardest. Quite easy actually. Again, problems with my heuristic of: the more moves it takes to solve, the harder it is), and after they completed it, they decided to press next. BAM. Exception. Fuck. Patched that.

Next bug took a while to present itself (in relative terms. More like a day, rather than 20 minutes). Some problems with GC silliness. I don’t entirely understand it myself, but I was getting OOM errors. I believe this was more due to a memory leak (i.e. my fault, rather than the GC being retarded). I had a bunch of bitmaps I was storing. Which I thought would get collected when I called Activity.finish() on my game activity. Apparently not. Anyway, I just called Bitmap.recycle() on them and then set the references to them to null. Furthermore, I set it so no activity would be recreated when the screen orientation was changed, so if there were still leaks, there would now be less of them. This mitigated the problem.

    &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" media=""screen and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 2.0)"" href=""css/xhdpi.css""&gt;
    &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" media=""screen and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5)"" href=""css/hdpi.css""&gt;

    &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" media=""screen and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 0.75)"" href=""css/ldpi.css""&gt;

Then I get an email from someone who's installed the app on a Nexus 7 and is just getting a blank line where the icons should be.

After some panic and a lot of digging, I fire up an emulator for the Nexus 7 to see if it's device-specific. And I discover that it has a device-pixel-ratio of 1.33. So of course, none of my CSS files are getting applied.

So a little warning to anybody using media queries to choose icons (or indeed anything else) and following the recommendations I was following, possible pixel-ratios aren't **just** those they quote. So you need to do media queries using -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio and -webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio if your app is to work on this (and possibly other?) device.

I spent many months learning and developing a Tower defense game. Although I finished pretty much all of the code and the game itself, I never actually managed to find decent art, and having no art abilities myself I abandoned the project. I have decided to put it on github as a nice full reference implementation of a game.

Also note, I have not gone in and cleaned up any code, done any kind of work or prettying up before posting it here, this is basically a random stopping point from when I got a little burned out and just ran out of motivation.. I wish I was gifted in art like some of you =)

Note not all the art is public domain, and some code was copied here and their, can't say the entire thing is able to made public domain. Also the game was built on top of AndEngine GLES1, which has a different license you can find here: andengine.org

Github link:
https://github.com/cstockton/epiris-td-example

Here is a doc I made so you can get a idea of some of the features:

--------------------------------

EpirisTD (BETA) is a innovative and new tower defense game. Currently 6 open maps allow building complicated mazes on THE largest maps available on the marketplace (2048x2048) pixels! You may build 50 Towers which include 5 tiers of upgrades, but don't worry once your towers are fully upgraded you may invidivualy boost stats and functionality of your towers, including damage, range, speed, affects, purity and finally access to each towers ULTIMATE.

Towers offer the most unique attacks on the marketplace, some will root enemies in place, stun them completely or silence them to prevent them from casting abilities. Did I mention your enemies are intelligent hordes of wizards and swordsman, who have unique abilities themselves, including removing your stuns and snares, healing eachother and offering boosts of speed or teleportation.

Achievements can be unlocked to earn you game points which can be redeemed to upgrade your towers and give special bonuses and affects. Fast forward and level skipping both available, challenge yourself by having a unlimited number of enemy waves spawning in paralell.

Currently a survival game mode that never ends is the only game mode available, but many more are in the works.

EpirisTD is in very early BETA and should only be downloaded by those who want a sneak peak of a work in progress and offer feedback for features and balancing.",,False,,t5_2r26y,1347155942.0,,,True,t3_zl0am,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/zl0am/i_am_releasing_my_full_reference_implementation/,

Getting on review sites/blogs makes a huge difference. A lot of them seem to be scams today trying to charge you for reviews.

I'm not sure if anybody has seen this before, but I noticed [Reddit is Fun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit) gave users the option to turn ads off.

I thought that was a nice touch. I left them on to be supportive. 

Then I was thinking that one of the big complaints about ads is bandwidth hogging - so I put a similar feature into my app.  Instead of just on/off, I added a ""Wifi-Only"" mode in the update I did last night.

Just putting the idea out there for people to consider if they hadn't thought of it before.

If this is old news, my apologies.

I came up with a trick/technique which I haven't found discussed online yet -- blurring mipmap levels, then picking between them using the *bias* parameter of texture2D(). This way we can increase/decrease the blur strength simply by sending a float uniform to the fragment shader; and otherwise everything renders as per usual (no extra draw passes or FBOs).

I describe the technique in brief [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/wiki/Lerp-Blur-Brief). I've included more discussion and LibGDX code in [this article](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/wiki/OpenGL-ES-Blurs).

I have two paid apps that get some sales, and one of the two apps has a free version that brings in a little bit of money from ads. My free app has &gt;10k downloads, but I only have about a 1% purchase rate on the paid version.

So, my question to you... what do I do next to get to my goal? More advertising? More web presence (maybe a Facebook page and Twitter account)? Put it on the Amazon marketplace?

**219,734** impressions filled. **667 clicks**. For a total of **$26.87**. This equals about **4 cents per click**, in effect.

The cost for this is that it annoys all my users all the time.

So that's it. Personally, I'm done with the AdMob 'scam', there's almost no money in it, and it lowers the appeal of our apps. 

My apps are typical freemium apps, and i make a lot more from sales of the full version. Unless your app is the kind that has hundreds of thousands of users, I would recommend you go the same path :)

In other words, I now owe Google thousands of Euros because they've sent way too much money to my bank account. I sent them an email through the contact form and I'm now waiting to hear back from them.


I'm located in Germany and I was prompted to provide SEPA account information at the end of June. Wondering how this mess is going to play out now, because Google is probably not happy about me having thousands of Euros of their money in my bank account.

This happened to me while I was following the getting started tutorial on the Google development site... very frustrating. Seeing as Android Studio is still in its early stages, should I stick with Eclipse? Or is it stable enough for someone who is just learning to get started with it? 

Right away I'm having trouble with the project structure in Android Studio, and how it differs from Eclipse. Can someone explain to me why  the project structures are different? For instance, why do I find my R.java file under app\gen\com.example.app\R.java when I'm working in Eclipse, but in Android studio I find the R.java in app\build\source\r\debug\com.example.app\R.java?

My hope here is to help out just-starting developers get on their feet and become more well known. 

If you were planning on submitting, or wanted to submit a friend of yours for example, we were hoping to ask for:

* quick developer bio
* features that the dev wants us to focus on when reviewing
* name and play store link obviously

From there we would do our best of having a nice round-up of a few small-time applications that could really help both the users and the developers out. Before I proceeded with the project and designing the page and whatnot, I wanted to know what you guys had to feel about the subject; as an Android user, how would you like to read articles like that on a website dedicated to giving out a helping hand to small-time devs?

You can sure as hell bet that ""Gender and Race Issues in Children's Literature"" gen ed course didn't help at all to come to that conclusion years earlier. This late realization put me in a jam amongst other graduates who did realize this is what they wanted and compete for the same types of jobs.

However, I'm having trouble visualizing and figuring out what exactly that entails. I'm hoping a few of you can guide me to the right resources. Right now, I'm unemployed and my java is shaky, but is the language I know best. What can I say, I'm a recent graduate with no real world experience. What can I do to prepare my self the best? Yes, I am coding and working that, but that is just more practice. I would like to incorporate the software development side (Best practices? I suppose) when I code.

**Andlytics**
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.andlyticsproject&amp;hl=en

Free app for keeping track of your downloads/reviews/comments on the Play Store. Get notified as soon as somebody leaves a review/comment - you can also reply to reviews straight from this app as they come in.


**Appmonger**
http://rectangularsoftware.com/appmonger/

Get notified of every new purchase and in-app purchase.
Allows you to group purchases by product id if you have multiple ones.
Lots of nice graphs for tracking your revenue before &amp; after Google fees.
Also has a nice widget that allows you to quickly view how much you've made in total/this month/last month etc. Compatible with old Google Checkout and the newer Google Wallet that most people have been migrated to. Far nicer than trying to track revenue via the Developer Console.


**FreshDesk**
http://freshdesk.com/helpdesk-tour/

After a while when your downloads rise and support emails start coming in, it can get messy and overwhelming. FreshDesk is a really nice to use and dead-easy to setup helpdesk that keeps track of incoming requests and allows you to setup some clever automation rules. Best thing, it's free for up to 3 support agents. 


**Google Analytics**
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.giant&amp;hl=en

Probably an obvious one, but the Google Analytics Android app just got updated and is really nice now! Including the SDK in your app is as easy as adding the JAR in and for the quality of statistics you get back it's a no-brainer. 


**QuickFile**
http://quickfile.co.uk

For any devs in the UK, QuickFile offers free online accounting that connects to your bank account, and automatically tags payments in/out. You can quickly upload expenses/receipts via your phone camera &amp; dropbox. It can also generate all of your P&amp;L / balance sheets in the format required for submission to HMRC / Companies House or that an accountant expects.


**Trello**
https://trello.com/b/UYNj6yTj/juicessh-roadmap

We use trello to publish an informal roadmap and keep our customers up to date with what we're working on. It also allows our customers to set the priority of what do by voting on items. It also means that when we get repeat emails for feature requests we can point them in the direction of the roadmap and show that it's already on our list.

1357405112.0,34,self.androiddev,160h3d,My app's been cloned! Can I do something more than flagging?,55,21,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/160h3d/my_apps_been_cloned_can_i_do_something_more_than/,"I've got a fairly popular fun app with thousands of daily users. Last night I got an e-mail from a chinese sounding name that said the following:

&gt; Hi Tmarki,
&gt; 
&gt; I've found someone stole you android app and cracked then re-published it on Google Play.
&gt; 
&gt; Please check it! The following link maybe help you.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, Google Play is not a security AppStore. You must be careful on this.

And then a link to the clone app. For reference, my app is:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmarki.trollphoto

while the cloner's version is simply:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmarki.trollphoto.zz

For their credit they created new screenshots and icon, but the expanded permission requirements hint at the fact that they probably added other nastier things as well.

On one hand it feels good that my app is popular enough to get cloned, but on the other it would probably be better to get it removed, along with banning the developer account which seems to only have cloned apps.

I knew that this problem exists before, but now that it happened to me I'd like to ask what can I do besides flagging the app and asking my friends to do as well?

Is there some hidden form or e-mail address where we can submit mass infringers like this?

Thanks!

I recently came up with some cool app and interface ideas, but since I’m a beginner in Android development, it’s kinda painful to make nice and useful apps just now. I’m about to widen my portfolio, and looking for developers who are in the need of app design or just lack the required skills to make good looking designs, assets etc.

About me:

* I’m a web and graphic designer since 10 yrs, I have the required basic skills to make something nice. I’m familiar with the actual trends, design patterns, UI requirements etc.
* I’m an avid Android user, and a wannabe app developer :)
* I live and work in Europe

What I can do:

* App design, UI design, icon design, logo design, anything design related in general

What I’m looking for:

* I’m mostly looking for individuals, startups, small companies etc. who have app ideas but lack the design skills, and because of that the development process is slow
* New apps or interface revamps
* Paid and free softwares are both welcome
* I’m mostly looking for app interface design works, but anything design related will do
* I’m not just into graphics, but more likely willing to design entire app interfaces, ui logic etc.
* I’m not able to design complex game graphics. I just feel that I don’t have the time and resources to do something like that. Small casual games might be okay though.

What I need in return:

* All the design work is free of charge. I don’t care if you make a fortune with your app, or just target thousands of free downloads. I sign papers, waive my rights if you need me to.
* You don’t have to credit me at all, but of course, I’ll be glad if you do so.
* I will include these work in my portfolio.

Just PM me if you’re in the need, I have some examples too. Thanks for reading.

Who wants to join together to create an open source alternative?  

A few needed points:  

* Notifications disappear when marked read from anywhere (ie voice.google.com)  
* Jelly Bean notification actions  
* Push  
* Contextual long-press action bar  
* Sensible back button  
* Better design  
* Tablet optimized  
* No phone number needed to sign in  

Of course, there's no API, but there are plenty of projects out there that are deconstructing the calls to create one. The best start is probably [voice.js](https://github.com/amper5and/voice.js); an API built with node.js. A more pressant library would probably be [Google Voice Java](http://code.google.com/p/google-voice-java/), but I don't know how old it is.  

We should start by just making a good SMS app; something more akin to the stock messaging app. Then, over time, add voicemail, settings, and such.

**Edit**: Sorry for the delay, I'm working in Switzerland until January. Timezones and all that.

**To Help Out**

I've started a GitHub project page. Let's work on gathering information and syncing up. Everyone who wants a better app is welcome and encouraged. Ideas are needed as much as code.

I just published my first app to the android market after two months of development, and it feels GREAT. No-one's even downloaded it yet (according to my stats page) but since it went up last night I've been unable to sit still because I'm so excited.

I've been a professional software developer for almost three years since graduating university, working for service companies who develop software for clients. During that time I've shipped several products but my reaction has always been 'meh, time to move on to the next thing'. I've never really been excited about releasing software that I've written. Most of it was boring enterprise-level stuff that I'm sure is really useful but lacks creativity and flair and is ultimately 'uncool'.

I've been playing with android dev since I picked up an HTC Dream (G1) in August '09 or there abouts. It's been a hobby on and off since then, every few months I'd dive into it for hours a day, then burn out for a little while. Some days I'd get home from looking at code all day and not want to touch Eclipse ever again. Projects would be left untouched for months on end. Turning your passion into a job can be tough like that.

All my rambling is leading up to this point: Now that my app is out there in the wild, I feel GREAT. I published it late last night and my hands were shaking as I uploaded it to the market. I've never been this excited programming before. All the work I put into coding, finding bugs, fixing bugs, learning some UI and graphic design? Worth it. Totally worth it.

I'm a freelance web developer working from France, and I also have a bit of experience with android. I'm getting paid to work for my clients, but I'm not developing softwares or apps that I could sell myself.

Lately, I've been thinking about developing multiple income sources. On the long run, my goal is to create a reasonable (a few hundreds of €) and passive stream of income, i.e something that would not depend of a client's good will. I'm considering starting to work half time for my clients, and half-time for myself.

So, I've got a few questions:

0) Is this the best place to ask?

1) How hard is it? How much time and effort should one invest to create such an income stream? Does this sound a reasonable goal to you?

2) Is developing and selling an app can create long term income, or does it create a burst of revenue before getting forgotten?

3) How much time do you spend promoting your work, instead of just coding?

However, not only can you watch variables, but you can watch ""expressions"" as well. Literally, adding the expression ""status == 2"" will evaluate whether the variable status is equal to the value 2 and the ""value"" column will show true or false.

Taking that a little further, you can do something like this:

new java.util.Date((long)event.endTime).toString()

and it will show the current date in the value section. You can use any variable available in the current scope as parameters to different functions that will be evaluated on the fly. It's really powerful. I would have expected this from something like .NET and Visual Studio, but it blows my mind that this kind of real time evaluation is available in Eclipse.

You guys probably all knew about this already, but it blew my mind at least. :) More of a Java dev tip than Android dev, but useful nonetheless.",,False,,t5_2r26y,False,,,True,t3_vi22k,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/vi22k/helpful_tip_for_devs_using_eclipse/,

I (shamefully) watched them for hours, finally deciding it could only be better if I was able to take it with me on the go.  So I decided to make an android version.

Honestly, it's not the greatest demonstration of a proper genetic algorithm, but it's fun to watch I think, and was a good learning exercise.  I just wanted to post it here for people interested in either physics with box2d/libgdx or the basics of genetic algorithms, in the hopes that it will help someone out.  You can do whatever like with the code, but as it is largely a port of [HTML5 Genetic Cars](http://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/), I'd ask that you give his project a look over as well.  And respect any wishes he may have regarding the code.

I don't make any promises about the stability, but if you find issues I'd be more than happy to merge in fixes.

Enjoy!

What I'd like to see is one or more nice-looking app themes made available under a loose license (CC maybe?) that app developers can use without much effort to improve the look and feel of their apps.

I've been googling this for the last couple of days but to no avail. Has anyone had any luck finding app themes/styles to use in their apps? Would anyone be able/willing to contribute to a shared set of android app themes?

I had some downloads, not a lot, it was ad supported, not a paid app.
  
Never declared I was officially supported by NASA, so I don't know why they tell me I'm impersonating someone, and for the violation of IP, every picture is always accompanied by their copyright notice if present in the original page-
  
Moreover on the APOD site, at the [About APOD](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html) page, there is this declaration:

""We are aware of several ""new media"" venues that carry APOD-related content. Most of these are done on a volunteer basis and are not supported directly by APOD or NASA. In sum, APOD considers these to be mirror sites that make classic APOD content readable not in a different language -- but with different technology. Some of these venues might partially support themselves by carrying advertising next to uncopyrighted images. This seems OK to us and we have therfore given them permission to use APOD text as it seems to give a broader reach to APOD's educational mission. Please note that neither APOD nor NASA receives any part of any advertising revenue.""
  
As they declared the we can use advertising next to uncopyrighted images, I decided to not place any banner next to images, but the only banners visible where in the textual screen of my app (like the explanation page that describe the picture, or the archive list).  
So why remove my app only now, after 2 years?
  
What should I do?

This is an open letter to the Android/Linux/Networking and Free Speech Community Developers. I had an idea for combining two or three projects that could make the Internet truly free. There are three projects that seem to me to be destined for each other and those are Mesh Wireless, Phantom Protocol and an Alternative open top level root DNS System. Now it seems to me that any Android or Linux Device could participate in a Mesh Network and also could run the Phantom Protocol on top of that. With enough Free Speech advocates utilizing Android and projects like Open WRT a robust and reasonably fast anonymous network could be built that spans the world. Or at least great parts of it. Utilizing one of the new Alternative DNS open root systems. It would probably be beyond any one Governments control.

It would be great if there could be some positive discussion around this, don't just drop by to report problems without offering solutions, thats pretty intellectually lazy ;)

I don't mean to be all touchy feely but I am not sure how else to get the message around that the world needs something like this. I'm not going to make too big a deal about it, but I will cross post to here in a number of other sub-reddits. If you know anyone who is into developing protocol stacks maybe send it there way, it can't hurt right?

Thanks for listening.

I've decided to put it online with the hope that others might find it useful for learning how sensors work and how sensor readings can vary across devices. The app is not compatible with older devices (but everything upto and including honeycomb should be fine).

[link here](https://github.com/imacg/SensorFun)


**features**

* enumerates all sensors on device
* tells you which sensors are the default for a sensor type
* displays static sensor info (manufacturer, version, etc)
* gives raw output of sensor values
* displays sensor update frequency


**future features**

* data logging to file
* graphs
* UI improvements (tablet layouts, fragmentation, etc)
* compatibility with android devices as far back as API7
* ability to request different update frequencies

EDIT: if anyone has any specific feature requests I would be happy to oblige.

The script will appear in a new Android top-level menu.

I'm definitely going to be using this script; I figured I'd share it. I might work on expanding it in the future.

I just wanted to see what people thought about my new app, Giganticon.  It's a widget which lets you put HD giant icons on your home screen.  The first two icons are free, and a tip for redditors is that you can unlock a free third icon by clicking on the cloud when you're asked to upgrade.

[Here's the Play Store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabetaubman.giganticon) and [here](http://gabetaubman.com/projects/giganticon/) is my website which describes it a little bit more.

Hope you enjoy and let me know if you have any feedback.  Already planned for future versions are:

* Optionally adding labels to the icons.
* Allowing setting of custom icons even if a HD one exists.
* HD icons for the built-in apps like SMS, Phone, Camera, etc.  (I'm working a designer to replicate those icons since HD ones aren't available.)
* Support for icon packs (if you have a favorite one, let me know).
* Allowing other types of gigantic widgets such as calling a person or texting a person.

Video of glitch: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCcyP--AMWk&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player)

Recently a user reported this bug to me that they found with their 4.2 device. Without getting into too much detail about my app, it basically puts out a bunch of buttons that you can then press and set an alarm (if you're curious about the app: [90night](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonathannakhla.sleeptimecalculator)).

**So what is the glitch? Here's a quick rundown of it all:**

* User uses an app that has the ability to set alarm
* App sets alarm using 4.2 stock alarm app
* 4.2 alarm app appears. Alarm appears to be set with toast notification showing and the alarm app showing to be on
* BUT there is no alarm icon in the top right next to he time/WiFi/data icons
* Alarm never goes off because even though alarm may seem like it has been set, in reality it hasn't

**How do you (as a user) fix this glitch?**

* Once an alarm has been set by an app, simply change anything in the alarm (by turning it on/off, changing it to repeat and back, changing the label, etc) or changing anything in one of the other alarms

**How do you (as a dev) fix this glitch?**

* Somehow let your users be aware of the glitch
* A more practical fix would be when creating your intent, to also pass through the ability to skip the UI if they're on 4.2

As you can see this is a very serious issue since setting an alarm usually means that you want to be reminded of something important. I apologize if my app caused any of you to wake up late due to this glitch.

I have designed a few applications for school, research, and in my internship, but I consider myself still very inexperienced in large-scale, professional software engineering. I am wondering how to improve my development methodologies to ensure well-written, modular, extensible code and creating an easily maintainable res/ setup. Typically, for work we meet in a smaller group with a ""back-end"" engineer (the guy writing our REST services and so forth), a graphics artist/designer, and myself. These meetings end once we have a satisfying set of lo-fidelity mockups. I do both programming and implementing the artist's graphics/layout designs. 

After I setup a new project with Git and known maven dependencies, I have mixed feelings on how to approach the project. In general, I find myself starting in the res/ folder before any programming is done. I'll import some standard values  (margins, padding, company color schema, ...) and theme boilerplate code (since I don't have colorized, high-fidelity mockups at this point) to view my work. Then, I update the Manifest, including all known activities in the mockups. Finally, I work on creating layouts/activities one at a time until it all connects together.

The issue I run into a lot is that, activities &amp; fragments often contain repeated code that isn't separated out until I refactor later. However, this can get a bit overwhelming if I find myself refactoring in many places. My general approach is that, if I refactor immediately after I find myself repeating myself.

Eventually, assets and high fidelity mockups start coming in and, if the activity is implemented, I'll redefine the layout roughly (but not pixel-perfect at this point). When it comes time to review progress (especially with my boss), it seems easier to sell a ""prettier,"" but an incomplete app. I worry that the time I spend here, can sometimes be a huge waste of time if we decide to change the core design of the app around that activity. 

As more and more of these features get thrown in, and constant refactoring gets put into place, I find myself doing sanity-test testing work on Genymotion to check for huge programmatic issues. Once the application is mostly/fully functional, we review again. If there are substantial changes to make (something just doesn't seem to work right/nicely) then the previous process repeats itself. 

Finally, I work on custom animations and pixel-perfect layouts. During this time, I'll also take breaks to start writing out a larger testing suite than what I had before. Once most of the testing is out of the way (done by mostly myself, but also by coworkers testing each other's work) there's one ""final"" review. 

After this is still unfamiliar to me. I don't publish work to the playstore because it's intended to be distributed privately (school, internal work apps, etc). Typically, I make sure proguard is configured correctly and release the signed apk internally via e-mail. 

I feel that our design process is rough around the edges. Particularly, I still feel uncertain about the following:

* How/When/Who to handle testing?
* Should the app be polished as I go along, or should I get the overall programming ""core"" finished first? 
* At what points do you decide to handle code review?
* Do you handle formal documentation along the way, do you frontload it? do you do at after development?

&gt; Hello,

&gt; We are committed to providing you with a consistent and reliable payout experience while we introduce new forms of payment to better serve your users and create more revenue opportunities for you. In order to do so, we are shifting our payout date to 15 days after the month’s end.

&gt; Starting in February 2013, we will transition you to a schedule from being paid two days after the end of the month to 15 days after the end of the month.  In an attempt to ease the transition, we will make two interim payments before you are completely shifted to the new payment schedule as follows:

&gt; - February 2nd: Payment for January sales
&gt; - February 15th: Payment for February 1 - 13 sales
&gt; - March 15th: Payment for February 14 - 28 sales
&gt; - April 15th: Payment for March sales

&gt; And every month after, you will also receive payment on the 15th.

&gt; We remain committed to offering a best in class marketplace for developers to sell their apps.  These changes will allow us to ensure users can buy your apps and we can transmit payments to you in a reliable fashion.

&gt; If you have any questions, please contact Google Checkout Merchant team at http://support.google.com/checkout/sell/bin/request.py

Sometimes, when these requests fail I get the error ""UnknownHostException: andidogs.facebook.com"" or similar. Since I created this app in four different variants (separately with four different cross-platform frameworks for my thesis), I'm quite sure this has something to do with Android's SDK or system.

I don't have any clue where this is coming from, but it scares the hell out of me!! This is serious shit. Doesn't matter if the hostname is replaced by ""xyz.facebook.com"" or ""xyz.nigerian-scam-website.org"". Do you have any ideas?

Some diagnostics:

* This happens quite rarely, until now I had it with two variants of the app (native Android SDK, and Titanium framework, both using the same underlying Java methods for networking)
* The request actually goes to xyz.facebook.com which does not exist
* ""getprop net.dns1"" commands gives me 192.168.15.1, my local router's IP (correct)
* AVG Antivirus didn't find anything
* Don't know how to get DNS cache content

**UPDATE:** Just tried if this would happen on the emulator as well, and found something else in the app built with the Titanium framework. It tries to do the request over api.appcelerator.net as a proxy it seems (related: [What does api.appcelerator.net do?](http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/84061/what-does-apiappceleratornet-do), and I have ""&lt;analytics&gt;false&lt;/analytics&gt;"" in my settings)! I double-checked my DNS cache and the Wireshark results. This is the request:

    GET /my/webservice/query HTTP/1.1
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    User-Agent:
    Host: andidogs.dyndns.org

If you have a S4, go to settings-&gt;More-&gt;About Device and scroll down to the bottom. Notice the SELinux status, once its knoxified, from what i'm told, it changes from permissive to enforced you can no longer get root access.

The Knox Agent on the device will kill any attempt and force close out the application that attempts to write to root. Also, from Odin you can no longer update ROM's unless signed by Samsung.

During the past few months, I have been learning **a lot** developing my first more serious app. (I have a not-so-serious [quiz application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dabbe.dota2quiz) with 12000 downloads which I do not maintain). 

When I began my project, I knew nothing about e.g. databases, http requests and not as much as I know about the android project as I do now.

I have developed an application called [The Story](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dabbe.thestory.free) ([Full Version here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dabbe.thestory.full)). It is a word game where you begin a story and type a few sentences, send to your friend (up to 4 players per story) who can only see the last eight words and is supposed to continue your story. This goes back and forth until the rounds you have chosen in the start are over.

Even though I am a developer, I have designed everything myself. From database structure, to code, to icons and visual design. (No graphical designer friends :()

There are limitations (of course) and things that I aim to fix, a few of them are listed in the Google Play description.

I would appreciate it very much if you would try out my application and let me know what you think!

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/PzDfF#9mbhO)

The main features:

* Browse any subreddit
* Swipe between images to go backwards or forwards (new images are loaded automatically)
* Ads can be disabled.
* Toggle Nsfw images on/off
* Supports decoding Imgur URLs and albums
* Sort by age and category (Hot, Top - All Time, etc)
* View a post summary with title, upvotes, subreddit, comments, submitter
* Pinch-to-zoom on any image
* View animated Gifs
* Share posts with other apps
* Supports 2.1+
* View the full post on the Reddit Mobile site (or open it in another Reddit mobile app)
* Images are cached to avoid repeated downloads, available cache size will vary by device.

I am trying something new with this app i'm calling ""RateWare"".  Ads can be disabled at any time via the settings menu, in exchange for disabling ads I ask that users rate the app in the Google Play Store.  It works on the honor system, you don't have to e-mail me for a key, all I'm really looking for here is more ratings and more reviews - whether they be positive or negative.

I tried to find other examples of RateWare on the market, but I was unsuccessful, if anyone has encountered other examples I'd love to hear of them.

I'm releasing the free version with the features above, and later a Pro version that includes additional features like:

* Logging in
* Loading subscribed reddits
* Upvoting and downvoting posts
* Saving posts
* Saving images

It will be a bit of a hybrid between freemium and ad supported apps.

Where should the state be stored and how? Should I use the bundle of onSaveInstanceState, shared preferences (probably not because I don't really need persistent storage for this, and it would make storing custom objects very annoying?) or onRetainNonConfigurationInstance and most importantly, why?

---


I'm scared and very excited right now. My baby or, in this case, piglet is finally out in the light. It's still unfinished and that, unfortunately, might hurt market ratings, but I need to get more feedback from more users. I was sending it out to my friends, but usually only 2 from 20 would report something useful back.

So here it is: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.snottyapps.pigrun

Disclaimer: I'm just an amateur-ish programmer and even worse designer/illustrator, but I try to do my best!

I'm using simple SurfaceView approach, but I'm thinking about trying out GLSurfaceView if that would help to get a better drawing performance.

Also, Admob seems to hurt performance a lot, even on faster devices, when it changes its adview (no ad rotation, just same ad changing text). Is it possible to do something here?

---

1_1 Update:

* fixed an issue which caused game to restart if keyboard state changed
* fixed (I think) ""music-out-of-nowhere"" bug
* fixed a landing glitch which enabled piglet to do a triple/quadruple jumps

* added an exit button, which quits an application with System.exit(0) (later on I'll add an option for advanced users who like this kind of behavior as opposed to what is actually recommended)

* changed the flow of jump (is it better now?)
* decreased speed boost and made it shorter

---

1_3 Update:

* fixed a bug where pig could ""land to deep underground""

* fixed a bug where pig could jump ""through"" obstacles

* changed action handling. It may fix ""Galaxy Nexus"" issues or it may ruin everything for some other device

* playable area now expands to fill larger screens (tck tck Galaxy Nexus)

* added help (kind of)

* redrawn ground (will probably redraw it again in future)

* added some minor visual improvements

---

1_4 Update

* added, hopefully, magical text: android:xlargeScreens=""true""

* fixed a little glitch in ground/grass animations

* optimized ground/grass drawing 

* added: settings section

* added: option to switch touchable areas

* added: options to toggle some drawable objects (might improve performance in slower devices)

* styled buttons a bit

* can't remember more, it's 5:30 AM.

**UPDATE:**

For people who are curious where I've made it with this so far:

I searched around a bit further and found [**this**[1]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LtMNut_U2Dj5mcsgGVjVYBXj6hs5VyKbHw6Rhoa8EDM/pub).  It shows how to customize a listview to look like a Card View. Perfect and native.

I've never worked with custom listview items, and have only followed the first 100 of the [TheNewBoston tutorials[2]](http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=6).  Therefore, I only know listviews as used in `public class MainActivity extends ListActivity{}`

and not extending just `Activity` which is what I need for my app. 
 
*eg. I will need [tabs and actionbar[3] ](http://www.survivingwithandroid.com/2013/06/android-action-bar-with-tab.html), above the custom ""cardview"" listview*

Lastly, I found [this youtube video[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJl1wpptl3A) that explains how to use a custom listview and he sets up an custom adapter, but doesn't explain any of the adapter really.

Can someone help me piece together a sample card view that looks exactly like what they've got in [[1]](http://www.androidhive.info/2012/02/android-custom-listview-with-image-and-text/) with some kind of image like what it's got?  They leave quite a bit out, unfortunately.  If you don't know how to do custom listviews and ListViewAdapters (me), it's really difficult.

I've just released as an open source repo on Github [ActiveTextView](https://github.com/laurencedawson/activetextview). This class adds the following options to links within TextViews:

* Long press menus when links are clicked ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/5vIiH.png))

* Fixes a critical Jelly Bean bug which causes the standard TextView to crash (http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=34872)

* Allows the developer to override the on link clicked behaviour, currently in TextViews, when a link is clicked it will automatically open the browser. This now can be overridden if you want to display an in app browser or something similar

Again, I've licensed it under the Apache 2 license so feel free to use it in your projects.

**I'm just having one problem, HTC devices on 4.0 onwards are not responding to the clicks. I had complaints from reddit sync users who also noted that this was happening in reddit is fun so decided to open source my implementation in the hope we could fix this.**

Thanks,
Laurence

**edit** I've updated my solution, if anyone has a HTC evo 4g it would be great if you could test the APK and let me know if the links work:

New providers arrive, others disappear or have issues paying their developers. So share who you're using now, who you used before, and how things are setup in your app.

Personally, I've been with admob since day 1. The permissions my app requires to serve ads is pretty important to me, and they only ask for android.permission.INTERNET while many other providers ask for location information which many of my users would not tolerate. Are there any other good providers out there that don't ask for location information?

Admob has been pretty good to me. The per-click revenue might not be the highest, but I have solid 95%+ fill rates and I've always received my payments on time. I have ads set on a 30 second timer, so based on certain actions a user makes in my app, it will either show a new ad, or if an ad has been up for 30 seconds, I hide it and make sure they get at least 30 seconds of ad-free time. This keeps ads out of the users face for 50% of the time, and also gives them a taste of what the app is like without ads if they decide to spring for the pro version.

I've also heard about adwhirl, and how it lets you serve ads from a central location from different providers. What have your experiences been with this? From a revenue standpoint is it worth integrating admob with another high cost-per-click ad provider?",,False,,t5_2r26y,False,,,True,t3_ydvdm,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ydvdm/lets_share_our_experiences_with_ad_providers/,

I should mention that I'm the ""Android expert"" at my workplace. Fortunately, no one asks me anything because I'm the only one working on it. 

Now that I've done a bit of playing around with Android, I've begun thinking about venturing into doing a bit of app development of my own, both as a hobby and in hope of making a bit of extra income there. 

My real question here is about hosting databases and webservices for apps to use. Obviously a lot of apps need to connect to a central server/service/database, and that whole side of things is where I've always felt most clueless. I've done bits with HTML, PHP, Javascript, ASP and all that stuff, but the actual hosting etc kind of boggles me. 

So... anyone care to offer a few tips? Where do you go for your DB, where do you go for your services? Is it the same place? How much does it cost? What are the pros/cons of using some sort of cloud-hosting service, like Microsoft's Azure (I ask this because the project I've been working on in my day job uses webservices and DB hosted on Azure)?

Edit: **Update**
So I'm pleasantly surprised by the amount of responses I got.  So let me give you a little bit of what I'm trying to do here, and the next step.

A buddy and I started our own LLC, [GhostApp Studios!](https://market.android.com/developer?pub=GhostApp+Studios&amp;hl=en), wanting to get into Android development.  Two major problems we've run into are: 1) Simply not enough time.  This isn't something that starts paying right away, so we have to do it in our spare time, which tends to be pretty tight. 2) The learning curve.  I can learn from the tutorials and examples, but it takes longer (see 1) to do this rather than being able to talk and ask questions of someone who knows what they're doing.  So, my thought was there are probably others in similar situations, and I created this reddit post.  Talking things over with my friend, we realize we can't hire anyone in the traditional sense, because that takes money.  However, there must be some way of doing this (note, we are in Arizona if someone has some ideas).  I know some people expressed the idea of doing something open source.  I think we can probably work something like that in too.  So for the next step, I created a [google group!](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/devs-of-reddit) that everyone can join.  I started a thread just trying to get some basic background info to see what we are working with.

My questions revolve around the things that you need to do AFTER you are done developing the app. So lets say, i just finished coding it, it runs good, it works, its ready for release, what do i need to do.

1. First would be to name it, how can i name it? where do i check to see if the name is already taken or something. 

2. How does the whole pay thing work? if i make a simple app and put it up for 99 cents, and choose to let people get a refund within 24 hours, what happens with the cash? like...at what point can you spend the cash without worrying about having to issue refunds, i mean, whats the whole legal thing with that?

3. What happens when you wanna update? does google provide some type of easy way to update things?

4. Creating a programming and publishing a program are 2 different things, I mean its one thing to make a program, but do I gotta worry about naming conventions? does the package name have to be something specific to google? or can I name the package name w/e I want, as long as it has my app name in it im assuming. 

Basically its small stuff like this that I still worry about, shit that has to happen after the coding is done. Ide love to hear from somebody who has published an app, just make a quick list of things that he did after he was done coding, from compiling, putting it into apk form (if that is what you do) and submitting it to google, how long of a wait, common problems/mistakes.

1348200933.0,18,self.androiddev,108el0,ListView lazy loading memory pitfalls and image caching tips.,26,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/108el0/listview_lazy_loading_memory_pitfalls_and_image/,"I'm working on the Android version of my company's next big release, and rewriting a codebase from scratch is an amazing learning experience. I started Android about 6 months ago on inherited, terrible, buggy, crashy code. 

Almost all of the crashes were out of memory errors, so eliminating those was top priority for the new version. Writing the image cache was a big part of this effort. I am just going to detail a few things you can do to make your image heavy app perform beautifully.

* Avoid ever having full large bitmaps in memory. Making your Http client stream straight to disk would be best. You can also write the byte array to disk as fast as possible once it downloads.

* Scale your images from disk by using the BitmapFactory.Options parameter inSampleSize. Google provides a handy method  that can calculate a recommended inSampleSize for your sizing needs in the [documentation](http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/load-bitmap.html#load-bitmap). If you use this method, cache the scaled bitmap. Decompressing with an inSampleSize that is not a power of 2 can have a performance impact. Only do it once per image size.

* While on the topic of BitmapFactory.Options, set inPurgeable and inInputShareable to true. This will allow your Bitmap's pixels to be garbage collected when memory is short. The bitmap will keep a shallow reference to its source enabling it to redecode itself quickly when its pixels are needed again.
    
        BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
        options.inJustDecodeBounds = true; // only calculate the size of the image
        BitmapFactory.decodeFile(bitmapFile, options);
                
        options.inJustDecodeBounds = false;
        options.inSampleSize = calculateInSampleSize(options, targetWidth, targetHeight);
        options.inPurgeable = true;
        options.inInputShareable = true;

        Bitmap scaledBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(bitmapFile, options);

* Use an LruCache for your in-memory bitmap cache. Do not make the mistake of limiting your cache by the number of bitmaps in the cache. Override the sizeOf() method of LruCache and return your bitmaps byte size. 

        // for older clients    
        int byteSize = bitmap.getRowBytes() * bitmap.getHeight();
        
        // api level 12+
        int byteSize = bitmap.getByteCount();

* I encountered one pitfall while populating my list view asynchronously with my brand new image cache. Scrolling was smooth and image loading performant, but the Samsung Galaxy S3 kept memory crashing on me. I kept weak references to all my ImageViews in my callbacks. I couldn't possibly be leaking so much memory. I turned to Google and I learned that ListViews have a scrolling cache enabled by default. In your xml just set android:scrollingCache to false (or in code). My memory usage on the S3 now stays steady and constant while scrolling. There was no noticeable performance hit from disabling the scroll cache. Keep your ListView items light.

* Use a ThreadPoolExecutor and Runnables to limit how many threads you are using at a time. On my medium-larger sized app with a lot of photo downloads, I have 2 threads for small images, 1 thread for larger images, and 2 threads for image processing and fetching from disk. Too many threads slows scrolling to a halt. This also prevents you from accruing a massive amount of in-memory byte[] arrays from downloading 100 images at the same time.

* **Always** perform disk operations asynchronously.


Would love to see more tips and suggestions from other devs.

She was bed ridden for nearly a year and still has a lot of screws in her leg. (God bless her). So you see, I never want to turn my phone to silent because if I get a call anytime day or night I want to get the call and be there. However, I did eventually turn my phone to silent for a few nights to finish up the project and yes, my mother is doing fine even though I turned it to silent. The project wrapped up, got launched, and the client is happy.

Because of this, I decided to develop ""Do Not Disturb"" for myself. So the idea is I can set time periods where if people call or text me my phone will not make a noise except only for the people I add to a whitelist. Kind of like call screening. So yeah, that's the idea and here is the app:

https://market.android.com/details?id=com.musselwhizzle.dnd.pro
and 
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.musselwhizzle.dnd.trial

So now that I have it released, I'm trying to get it reviewed and get the word out. I think a lot of people are like me with an elderly parent, or perhaps parents with kids, or even businessmen in meeting but still need to get that important call. But alas, it hasn't been reviewed yet. Do I need to pay for reviews? Some places like AndroidPit charge for reviews. Is this legit? There are a lot of other places like that charge. My first instinct is that I shouldn't be paying for a product review. 

So what do you guys think? How can I get the word out better? Is there any tricks to getting it reviewed? Should I pay to have it reviewed? If you happen to download the app, did you find it useful and easy to use?

Thanks gang. I appreciate you taking the time to read. 
Cheers!

One app will share download numbers (yay) and ratings (which may be worse from the free crowd).

One app will save the user data from the free to the paid version.  This is a benefit for my app.

Two apps will be easier because I won't have to worry about in-app billing code.  I've never used this, so I don't know how much complexity it will add.

The way Android was designed enables many things the app-centric iOS can only dream of, and for some reason google isn't taking advantage of it.

The core idea behind the Web is the hyperlink. With a simple URI (previously known as the URL) you can identify any piece of content and link to it. No piece of content lives in a vacuum, it refers to and is referred by other content. I don't really need to point out how powerful that idea was, just look at the Web now, and how much money Google has gained from organizing it.

All of Android is structured to reproduce the Web. Intents are the personal, modern-day, URI. With Intents and Intent Receivers, everything you do on your phone is supposed to be about dealing with data. Content Providers extend that idea, and give your phone it's own, local, Web of data.

Apple brags about how many apps are in the app store, I say let them have that title. Android isn't about apps, it's about organizing your life. Why Google isn't trying to push this idea, I don't really know.

What can I do to troubleshoot this issue? Some things I've tried so far include - uninstalling the app from my phone/emulator and doing a fresh install. Cleaned my project and all libraries it uses. Using the newest support library. I've updated all of the libraries. I've double, triple, ..., n-le checked the build path. I installed the Android Studio (grasphing at straws, thinking surely, this must be Eclipses fault) and tried to execute it from there and still, my app fails.

I removed any mention of Acra from my app, thinking that could be the culprit, but basically, the first piece of *my* code that my app tries to execute, it fails.

In certain cases we were inserting ~10,000 records in our SQLite database. 

Previously we were using     

    SQLiteDatabase.execSQL(String)

That too within a loop.

Using this method on the database meant that the insert process for ~10,000 records took around 30 mins.

Today we changed the method to this,

    SQLiteDatabase sqliteDatabase = db.getWritableDatabase();
    
    sqliteDatabase.beginTransaction(); //Statement 1
    
    String sql = ""INSERT INTO "" +""Table_Name(nameOfColumn, nameOfColumn2) "" +""VALUES (?,?)"";   
    
    SQLiteStatement insert = sqliteDatabase.compileStatement(sql); // Statement 2
    
    //Start loop
    
    
    insert.bindString(index1, value1);
    insert.bindString(index2, value2);
    insert.execute();    
    insert.clearBindings();   
 
    //End Loop
    
    

    sqliteDatabase.setTransactionSuccessful();    
    sqliteDatabase.endTransaction(); 

The time for the insertion of 10,000 records decreased from 30 min, to 15 seconds!

It was astonishing. Mind you that we didn't know what this method did, only that the Google search for ""Add ArrayList to SQLite database, Bulk Edit"", turned up a result that contained this code &amp; my teammate copy/pasted it. 

I looked into these methods, to ascertain why this was happening. 

First I think that the ""magic"" lies in Statement 1, i.e. The `beginTransaction()` method. The method API documentation states that it opens the database in `EXCLUSIVE` mode. This means that the lock on the database is gained only once and is released once we call `endTransaction()` or when the method fails.

Which in the case of using the `execSQL()` method in a loop means that the lock is gained and released each iteration of the loop. Whereas in the former case the lock is gained and released only once. This would defnitely save time. 

Second I think that in Statement 2, since the query is compiled only once and loaded once, this would also decrease time since compilation is not being done multiple times. However, the part where the values being inserted are changing is still very vague to me, I have a hunch that the values keep changing behind the scenes within the variable stack.

I could most definitely be utterly wrong about all this. That exactly is what the point of my post is. 

I want to know if I have understood this correctly, and if not, then how much wrong am I?

I am a lowly Field Services Representative for a major tech company and I have managed to get myself nominated to convert a website to an Android App. When finished this app will be used by 2-5k people working for a national account.

I would like to get paid a fair amount for my effort, or find some way of monetizing the situation above and beyond my $15/hourly pay. Software development is not in my contract and I am working on my own time but I am doing the work with corporate assistance.

My boss has offered me overtime pay for any work I do on the app, but the extra $100 a week or so for 6 months (approx $2400 total) seems paltry given the circumstances.

Do you think I should do the work and just add it to my resume, or should I lobby for a payout upon completion, or a set fee, or what?

Stay Awesome, Reddit!

What HTML5 framework does /r/androiddev prefer?,22,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/s9y01/jquery_mobile_is_slow_what_html5_framework_does/,"I'm building a cross-platform app, so I want to stick to HTML5/Javascript.  jQuery Mobile just about is good enough, and I'm sure I can customize it with enough hacking around to not look like a jQuery Mobile app.  The problem is even with transitions turned off, it isn't an *instant* response when selecting buttons even in the most basic skeleton.  The pro? The community is large enough, and it gets larger all the time because everyone knows about jQuery so it isn't about to go away.  If anything, eventually they'll finally get it optimized for Android.

The other frameworks like Sencha and DHTMLX do feel very responsive in the test applications.  The problem? Sencha Touch 2 has piss poor support for Windows dev and no support for Linux dev.  It is also another 'iPhone First' design like jQuery Mobile.  DHTMLX is one of the most native feeling ones out there, but it isn't the most intuitive and the community support is very small so it has a steep learning curve.  There's also a smaller and newer one like jqMobi, but there is almost no documentation. But, it is based off of jQuery, so it's somewhat decent to learn.  It has a very fast and smooth feel, but its still too new with some serious *small* but major bugs.

So what do you all prefer?  I know this has been asked, but not in recent months and this is such a changing technology that I think its safe to ask again.  And don't say, ""you can't have your cake and eat it too"", because there are a growing number of very clean and native-feeling HTML5 apps coming out all the time.  I personally feel as these libraries and methods get better, we can get a true cross platform development going that isn't subjected to waiting months on end between an iPhone -&gt; Android release (and even our friends in Windows Phone). 

LinkedIn is one of the best examples in recent months, and it works so flawlessly.

I have noticed that the creation of layouts is just the same as with Eclipse.

I have only created a game with Unity For Android before, so this would be my first normal app.

I have no problems with grasping the concept, or the code, but I do have a problem with creating Layouts. I can throw controls on the view, but I want more than that. I want to create what I have in my mind. I want to create a beautiful app.

What are all the properties for on the controls? I haven't been able to find any tutorial or any documentation about it that goes deeper than just the basics. Most tutorials are about the code, and that is something that I don't have any issue with.

Just trying every single property is also not really an option because of the nature of development. It takes to long to 'run' an application because of the need of the virtual machine. 
My programming time is sadly enough limited, but my reading time is a lot less limited (Hooray for a smartphone :)). So any tutorial or documentation online would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR; Any good tutorials or documentation about creating nice looking layouts?

The framework itself seems handy, and kind of useful. 'One language to rule them (mobile devices) all' and all that. One and done. But, it works by allowing the developer to write essentially one website then using phonegap to make it work locally on multiple devices. That seems like its trying to much for too many. Just using Java, I know I can make an app for Android both efficient and secure, not to mention cool looking. With phonegap? Shmeh, it seems like it wouldn't allow Android to thread it correctly and force all HTML, Javascript, and CSS to be processed through the same pipe. 

I'm not great at HTML and CSS. Java however? Pretty good at it. So to me, it just seems like a framework for people who can't code using Java or C. I'd like to be convinced otherwise.

I have 3 apps in various stores (I think they're all in about 10 stores so far) and this Monday I got an email from one company asking me if I'd sell one of the apps to them. The app in question has over 10k installs and is a free app. The app is ad supported but it's not really making me any money. I think I made a total of $350 from it which is quite terrible and in line with what I've made with my other two apps.

The company in question is offering me $0.25 per install which means they'd pay me around $3k. I think I can negotiate that number up a bit too.

After some back and forth emails and after some googling, I have a strong suspicion that the company in question is buying apps and installing spyware into apps so that once the user updates the app, they send all of the private info that they can get back to them. I imagine they make a nice profit from it somehow but I'm not sure how. They have a large number of apps in the store (over 100) and most of them were bought from others.

So my question is... should I sell? I'd really like to make a sale to recoup some of my investment and to finally make some profit... but I'm not sure what to do about the possibility that I'm aiding info thieves.

Hi all..
I'm a hobbyist Android developer and I'm stumped as to what triggers the HTC One X(and I assume the other ""One"" phones) to display it's soft menu button on the screen.

Common sense tells me that it should display for apps that aren't optimized for ICS, but my application is.

On the 4.0.x emulator, I have the overflow button only on the ActionBar(before optimizing for ICS, I had the overflow on the AB as well as on the navigation softbutton panel.

On my physical device, a Galaxy S Vibrant running a 4.0.3 ROM, I have the proper AB, and the overflow is not displayed since it is activated by the legacy capacitive menu button.

Those two cases seem correct. I've also implemented Google's compatibility libraries to make everything play nicely on pre ICS devices as well.

However, on the HTC One X, my app displays the overflow button in the AB as well as the soft menu button on the bottom.
Looked at the HTC dev site to see if there was something specific I needed to know, but I don't see anything in the way of documentation there, and even their OpenSense SDK didn't seem to be available to me(Eclipse gets a 401 when trying to download, even though my login/password work properly on their website. ..not that I'm optimistic about it holding the answer to this problem)

So I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similiar experience trying to adapt to the One X.. and if so, and you've solved it,.. what was the issue?

Thanks!

EDIT: for the benefit of anyone else who might stumble on this.. here's the solution(at least in my case).

1) Please don't copy and paste from tutorials, especially ones you have seen online, page encoding may not match and therefore when you copy and paste quotation marks can change and cause things not to work.

2) Google stuff, in this case it didn't help much, because of point 4.

3) Ask for help. Seriously ASK. Give us as much information as you can, try and give us any information that may not seem stupid. It will all eventually help. Subtle stuff can be useful.

4) When you find an answer, LET PEOPLE KNOW. Don't say nothing, don't say ""Found the solution"", if you've found places from step 2 where there is no solution, go to those places and update it.

I have been finding my app (paid app, $1.00) on more and more pirate app sites hours after posting new release. This app does cost money for me to host the service, which is why I charge a dollar for it.

What ways can I better protect my app from piracy? I'm releasing my app for API 9+, so I cannot take advantage of the new JB app encryption.

Is there any way to better protect while not hindering users with license checks? My app is generally left running and not stopped and started often, so perhaps a license check wouldn't be so bad?

I really just want to understand the best options for myself and users and I can't find clear developer options anywhere.

Piracy isn't a huge problem for me right this moment, maybe about two percent, I'd just like to get a handle on it before it becomes a bigger issue.

As a follow-up, how are these guys able to post a pirated version of my latest release so quickly?

Now I want to make sure the user experience is the same all the way down to gingerbread devices, so I want to use ActionBarSherlock. There is very limited information for doing this. I add the library as a dependancy to SlidingMenu and change all the ""extends __Activity"" calls to ""extends Sherlock__Activity"". But now SlidingMenu won't build. I get a bunch of errors about

So I have this app that talks to a server via rest APIs. I was just wondering what the best practices are for fetching new data from the server. 

I tried looking into using GCM to notify the app when there's new data to be fetched but I found that the push notifications from Google arrive at different intervals (some times instantaneous, some times after a few minutes, some times only after I restart wifi/mobile data)

I also considered doing polling at intervals, but I fear that this might cause significant increases to battery usage.

My hunch is it is a user of a competing app, watching for my updates, then updating his comments.  I don't know of any reason why a user would keep an app they hate just to update a comment without some other reasoning.

Recently I took an extension class for Android programming, which helped immensely.  Since then I've published one really basic app ('Flu Aware').  I'm continuing to read books and code, but wanted to work on programming full time.


Reddit, what's your recommendations and experiences with jumping into a programming role?  At what point do I know enough that I can start applying to junior Android programming positions?


There's a lot of nonprofits out there that I feel can really benefit from having current technology to help solve some of today's social problems.

It'd be nice to get a better idea of what I can look forward to in the future from some long time developers. So here goes:

I've been an app developer on the market for a little over a month. I have 7 apps currently out on the market, if you're curious you can see them all here: 

http://moneybagssoftware.blogspot.com

Of those, only 4 of them get consistent sales every day, I think you can make an educated guess and figure out which 3 aren't selling. I average 12 app sales a day. This translates to $8.40 a day after Google transaction fees. I've made around just over $300 since I started developing for the market a month ago.

Interesting notes:

-Where your app is located on the Android Market's search results list is a HUGE factor with regards to sales. Recently, all of my apps were raised a few notches up on the search list (my flashlight was on the first page of search results) and the sales boost was tremendous. Unfortunately this was short lived, all of my apps returned to their original positions in the search results and my sales changed back as well.

-Obvious but still worth noting, user reviews can make or break an app's sales. My massager app has literally gotten 0 sales since it got a bad review :(

-The Android Market SUCKS for developers, no way to respond to user reviews at all. Users have left comments so dumb it's impossible to articulate my rage sometimes. It blows that one bad review can have such a sudden and dramatic BAD affect on app sales.

What I'm most curious about is how do sales do over time? Do they stay consistent or do they just slowly taper off and die?

Luckily, their system is pretty robust already and not apt to change much at all.

How should I approach them with this?  Their current app in the market has 3 out of 5 stars and has low functionality and is just very amateur overall.  On their blog, they even mention how app updates are ""rolling out"", but that has stalled out for over 6 months now.  On the other hand, they seem like a very progressive, forward-thinking, innovative company.  They've held YouTube contests for publicity, for example.

This app has a lot of income potential, significantly more than their existing product.  They don't offer a freemium model at all, mainly, which would drastically augment their income level for various demographic reasons.  Most people would not pay for an app like this, so they are missing out on 3/4 of their market.

I have implemented many of the feature requests in their low rating comments.  In an ideal world, they would just buy me out, but realistically if I can just take a royalty from the app's revenue or vice-versa that would be fine by me just as well.  It would also be simple for them to Cease and Desist me and continue doing what they are doing, but they would miss out literally on 7 figures a year, instead of now where they are currently making a thousand dollars a month at best.  (This app is in a niche that supports a yearly subscription-based payed version on the freemium model).

Any thoughts on how to approach this and try to partner with them?  It turns out they are headquartered in my city, so I could meet in person in theory, but for practicality I can contact them through their website.

I come from the command line and I'm really only using Eclipse / GUI / Windows for the Android specific tooling.. so while the Git CLI gives me pretty much every thing I'd want, I don't think I'm expecting too much from EGit.

I'll lay out a few issues I'm having.. maybe I'm missing something and can be pointed in the right direction here? 

[This is the view](http://i.imgur.com/F3EBV.png) I'm having the most frustration with. 

* *""No Repository Selected""* - How do I select one then? I *have* had this screen populate with my repo, and I *think* it has something to do with the *Repositories* view. But I'll be dammed if I can figure out how to select the one repo I've been using so far.
* How do I stage part of a files changes, ie a `git add -p &lt;filename&gt;`? When I did have the above view populate with my working dir. it didn't seem to have an option to stage a partial. This has become a pretty critical part of my git work flow and I'm kinda hurting without it.
* How in the hell do I even view a diff of my current working-dir.? This is again a big part of how I work with git.

There's more, but they're my main pain points. Like I said, am I just missing something? Or is this plugin just not up to par? 

What are you guys using for tooling in addition to the Android Eclipse stuff and maybe EGit?
