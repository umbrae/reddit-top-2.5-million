1359679885.0,368,self.jobs,17ny7s,If I knew over a year ago what I know now - my advice for job seekers,409,41,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17ny7s/if_i_knew_over_a_year_ago_what_i_know_now_my/,"The last 18 months of job searching have been horrific for me. I've spent almost 20 years in IT, and have never seen anything like this. I've had 5 paycuts in my job, and make 10% less now than when I started. I started looking a loooonnnnggg time ago, and wish I would have known these things before. My wish is that this may help someone. 

Here goes :

1. It's a numbers game, but not what you think. The conventional wisdom is that you apply like crazy and hope for the best. This isn't true, because honestly, it's what everyone else is doing. Hone in on what you want, or where you want to do it, and drill down via various methods to find what you want. Focus your energy this way.

2. Linkedin is your friend.  This falls under a couple of topics:
   a.  Join groups specific to your field, and participate. Recruiters will post jobs here and nowhere else. Its how you build a professional network. In fact, one software group I'm a member of flamed and unsubscribed someone who dared ask a technical question, since Linkedin is for building a professional network and job hunting.
   b. Watch status updates for contacts on your phone. If someone lists a job (which is how I found mine), contact them and apply. If someone updates they got a job (or updates their profile to indicate their new job) it tells you two things. First, the company they moved to is hiring, and second, the company they left has an opening.  Use this to your advantage.
   c. If you found a job you want (by narrowing your focus), use Linkedin to find someone at the company and get info that way. Ask anyone you know in a hiring position and they'll tell you that they get hundreds if not thousands of applications for a job opening. No one can reasonably get thru all those apps. They want referrals from existing employees.  Use this to help you.

3. Volunteer, Volunteer, Volunteer. EVERY SINGLE TIME I was called on my resume, my volunteer work came up. This means something for recruiters. IF you are out of work, hiring managers want to know what you did with your time off.  Fill it.  Second, I used my volunteer work to round out my skill set, and got real world, practical experience that ultimately led me to be able  to move into a new role in my new position.

4. Join groups that have to do with what you want. Find them on meetup, or thru professional groups and user groups.  Go to meetings and make connections. Again, inside referrals are how you get jobs. The old school way of applying on-line and hoping for a call back is becoming obsolete. Make yourself known to people in your field, even if you are a noob. People will think of you when positions open up.

5. Help other people whenever you can. It will make you feel better about this whole process, and it WILL come in handy eventually. 

6. Never give up. This process was horrific, humiliating, and discouraging for me. I took a break for a couple of weeks to recharge my batteries, because I knew my desperation had to be showing, and I'm sure it was.  A break can do wonders, but do it with an end point in mind  because as heartless as it sounds, no one was going to get me a job but me.  Move forward even though at times its painful.

Ok, sorry for the wall of text.  Good luck redditors. And thank you for helping and comforting me, even tho I haven't been here long.

1373853968.0,362,self.jobs,1ib8x4,I used to work in HR and reviewed thousands of résumés. Here are my tips based on that experience (which involved a lot of me getting pissed off at really bad résumés). Happy to answer questions.,426,64,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ib8x4/i_used_to_work_in_hr_and_reviewed_thousands_of/,"*(My experience is entirely in the US; other regions may have different preferences. This advice is geared towards those who don't have years of full-time experience and are applying to entry-level-ish positions,  i.e. your average in-their-20s Redditor.*

*Also, the usual disclaimer: Every employer is different, and there's no one-size-fits-all list of rules for résumés. Use your head, and get opinions from other people.)*

**1. Your résumé must be one page.**

There are CVs (curricula vitae) and there are résumés. A CV can be however long it needs to be: its purpose is to tell an employer pretty much everything about you and your work history. If an employer wants a CV, they'll explicitly ask for it.

A résumé is like a one-page magazine ad. Its purpose isn't to tell everything about you — it's to make you stand out from everyone else. It will be glanced at for 3-10 seconds, during which you must interest the reader enough to make them keep reading or you'll be discarded. 

It's made even more difficult by how a résumé is *unlike* a magazine ad: instead of being printed in color and sandwiched by interesting articles, it'll very likely be printed in black and white using a crappy office printer and sandwiched by several dozen other résumés in a big stack. This leads to Point 2...

**2. Layout's really freaking important.**

Each item should have no more than 3 lines of descriptive info below it, whether that's 1 one-line bullet point and 1 two-line bullet point, 3 one-line bullet points, or one three-line paragraph. (3 lines is a *maximum*, not a recommended amount.)

Your résumé should be only black and white/grayscale. It will be printed out along with several hundred other résumés using a crappy black-and-white office printer. The colors will appear as gray, which doesn't attract the eye.

Many web-safe and/or sans-serif fonts (like Arial) don't read well.

Balance your blank space. Too little and you have a wall of text that will never get read. Too much and you look like you have no experience and/or no idea what you're doing. Have 1"" margins on all sides, use no smaller than 11pt font with regular spacing, and leave a blank line between each item/section.

For each work/education experience, this is the order in which the following should be presented to the reviewer: company (or school) name, job title, job date, job location.

**3. Don't include any info that goes without saying.**

You list ""bank teller"" as one of your job experiences. That's great! You don't need to explain on the résumé what your duties were — unless they were something beyond what a normal person would expect a bank teller to do (you led a major marketing campaign for your bank in your town that increased revenue by $50K) or accomplish (you won Employee of the Year).

Ditto for the vast majority of retail, sales, and food service jobs.

**Also**, you probably shouldn't include work experience from more than 6 years ago unless it's very relevant or you've working full-time specifically in your field for more than 6 years. If you've graduated from college, you probably shouldn't include your high school on your résumé.

**4. You don't need an ""Objective"".**

Everyone's objective is the same: ""to get a job"". Rephrase that however you will, it'll still read like fluff, won't add any value, and will just take up valuable space.

**5. If a verb doesn't describe a concrete action, you probably don't need it.**

*Leveraged, developed, contributed, managed, coordinated, produced, brainstormed*... These are all ""fluff"". They rarely add any meaning to your résumé and detract from its read-at-a-glance-ability. *Co-authored, lectured, built, cooked, taught*, etc. are physical actions.

For example, instead of writing:

*Managed company's Salesforce database and organized and maintained data
Produced high-quality vector graphics using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, and added to company's website using intermediate HTML, CSS, and Javascript*

...just write:

* CRM software: Salesforce, use and back-end development

* Vector graphic design: Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator

* Static web design: HTML, CSS, Javascript

**6. ""Qualifications"" should be mostly proper nouns.**

Certifications you've earned, software you've used, and so on. Things that ARE NOT QUALIFICATIONS:

*Hardworking, motivated, creative individual*

*Mathematically and technologically-savvy*

*Friendly and outgoing personality*

**7. Your grammar, spelling, and punctuation must be as perfect as humanly possible.**

Some other HR people with whom I worked didn't consider this to be so important. Every single time they hired someone whose résumé didn't have immaculate language, that person ended up being a less-than-outstanding employee.

Having perfect language conveys to the reviewer that you're smart, you know how to communicate, and you care enough about this position to triple-check your résumé and make sure there are no errors.

1370390462.0,286,self.jobs,1forak,"One full year of unemployment, 717 applications, and crying myself to sleep every night- how I finally got the jobs + tips + statistics",313,27,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1forak/one_full_year_of_unemployment_717_applications/,"Hi everyone! I finally landed a full time job!

Me: M.S in education 4.0, B.S in comm &amp; business 3.8. Six internships to my name. 

Basically, I was used to success and not achieving for the past year was really beginning to put me on a bad, bad path.

**Websites I applied to:** Linkedin.com, linkup.com, monster.com, careerbuilder.com, local help wanted site, indeed.com, craigslist.org, snagajob.com, specific company websites I was interested in using a bookmark folder

**Number of applications:** 717

**Number of interviews:** 7

**Ways I got the interviews:** blindly applying online (4), a recruiter finding my resume on careerbuilder (1), networking (2)

**Number of job offers I received**: 2 simultaneously- both were the positions found through networking.

**Things I did**: Looked at meetup.com for networking groups in my area, attended job fairs (waste of time IMO), looked up everyone in linkedin, purchased linkedin premium (worth the free trial to send inmails and express you interest via another route), checked above sites literally multiple times a day, tailored resumes and cover letters *usually* (ironically, 2 of my 7 interviews were from generic cover letters and resumes, go figure).

I love the chrome extension boomerang- it allowed me to write emails and inquiries and then send them the following morning at whatever time I wanted- I always chose 8:28- giving them time to clear their inbox but making me look eager.

**How I eventually got the jobs**: Both of my offers occurred today and they were the only 2 times I ever successfully networked. The worst part in job hunting is hearing NETWORK! I didn't feel like I had a network. Nobody knew anyone. Everyone loved to shout the word network at me, but nobody said how and to whom. When I read the word networking in this subreddit, I would literally fistpalm. It just sounds so easy and IT ISN'T! Eventually, I began literally mentioning my job search to anyone that would listen, in any context that was even a little remotely appropriate. At my Aunt's 50th birthday? Anyone who asks me how I'm doing I'd respond with ""good, still looking for a job"" - if they gave *any* opening like ""how is it going?"" and / or ""what are you looking for"" I immediately told them the types of jobs I was seeking. **My biggest piece of advice is when people ask what you're looking for, do not say 'anything.' It doesn't give people a chance to think about who they might know. Try to be vague without sounding vague. For example, I said I'd love a desk position at someplace like a college, or a doctors office, or anywhere with 9-5 hours.** Eventually, I caught my first break at a funeral. I was chatting with a grieving relative of a friend and dropped this line- he put me in touch with someone he knew, and guess what? This is the job I ended up taking. My 2nd opportunity for networking occured at a college graduation party- a random women overheard me talking and put me in touch with someone. I *literally* told anyone about my search who asked. Hey, they're asking, right?

My second big piece of advice, which I read on this subreddit and constantly had to repeat to myself was **shy people don't get jobs**. In my aforementioned story, I was put in touch with people. Those interactions took me weeks- I called them as much as I thought was appropriate without being overly annoying. I am not shy, but I often feel like I annoy people with my emails and calls. I eventually had to suck it up. You HAVE to call and check on your applications, you HAVE to follow up with more emails- it's the reality. Remember, you're not their priority. They have work and things going on - what is a big deal to you (finding a job at their company) is just another day in their life for them. Be prepared to step outside your comfort zone. I did not check up on all 717 jobs via phone, but only the ones where I felt like I was a particularly good fit.

Once you get the interview, that's a whole 'nother ballgame.

I literally went to bed in tears almost every night. It seemed like everyone had a job but me. I was jealous of people on this subreddit making posts like this- because they had something I didn't. It's so hard to not know when your big break is coming- but you won't be unemployed forever. It's not a reality. One day , you'll find something. I hope all of you sooner rather than later. I wish there was a magic pill or format but that's the worst part- it's unpredictable, no two hiring managers are going to want the same type of letter or resume, and what works for one person may not work for another. This economy sucks, being unemployed sucks, and writing cover letters and resumes for hours on end is the worst. I sincerely wish everyone Good luck, and I hope this helped even one person.

Another girl was told that she was coming for a System Analyst job. Everyone ended walking out of the room.

They say you can make $15/hour base pay, and you don't need any experience. This sounds great right? Perfect Summer job! That's what I thought.  I applied for a job with this company online, and they literally called me back 30 minutes after I applied, which is absolutely crazy; that never happens.  The person I talked to was very vague about the job description. She then told me the only open available times to come in for an interview was the day they called me or the next day.  So they scheduled an interview and I was psyched that I got an interview and all that.  So then I googled the company because I realized I had no idea what the company did.  Turns out if you google Vector Marketing you end up with a bunch of forums and pages telling you it is a scam.  I was shocked and researched further.  Turns out they sell kitchen knives from a company called CUTCO.  I also learned that every single person who has gone in for an interview says the interview  is the easiest interview ever, then you go in for a group interview and they give you a long presentation about their knives.  Now to actually work for this company you have to buy a set of the knives to use as demonstration knives.  It costs around $100.  So before you would even start you are in the hole 100 bucks.  Then I learned that you have to schedule ""appointments"" by your self with no help, and what I mean by that is you have to first rely on friends and family, and then you just have to find people by yourself, with no help from Vector.  Also these appointments are how you get paid, $15 per appointment.  So all in all, don't fall for this. yes you could potentially make money off of this, but you would have to work extremely extremely hard to get the money.  Don't fall for it like i did.

Everything goes swimmingly (or apparently so), good atmosphere, I think I answer everything sensibly, am prepared, etc. Towards the end of the interview, we have the following exchange:

**Interviewer:** So what salary range are you looking for?

**Me:** I am currently competitively remunerated.

**In:** Ok, well you must have some idea what you want to be paid

**Me:** I think at this point it is more important to make sure I am a match for the position and that we're a fit. If not then the salary issue really is irrelevant.

**In:** (chuckles) Well okay, do you not have a number in mind?

**Me:** I am looking for a competitive salary.

**In:** Do you mind me asking what you are currently paid?

**Me:** Well... do you mind me asking what your budget range for this role is? [credit to some recent thread here on reddit]

**In:** (chuckles again) No, that's fine. Our budget is X... to Y.

**Me:** Ok, that's interesting. Yeah, that was about the range I was looking for. [hint: it wasn't. The average between X and Y is 12k more than my current salary]

**In:** So do you have any questions for me?

I graduated in May and have yet to find a job. (I'll note that I am not just mass applying for any open position, but trying to be somewhat selective to avoid doing a job that I know will make me miserable such as call center jobs, etc) 

So far since May, I have experienced the following:

* 2 companies called and canceled my interview the day before because they filled the position. 

I think this is rude. Sure, they might have found a great applicant or had a great interview with someone, but what about me? I was never given the chance to prove myself.. this also goes for how many other people they had scheduled an interview with and canceled it on them.

* I had a company schedule a phone interview with me. They gave me a 3 hour time frame and then never called. I e-mailed them, (did not have a phone contact) and they e-mailed me back the next morning and did not apologize but told me the position was filled. 

I thought this was extremely rude. I sat around for 3 hours waiting for that damn call. I hate phone interviews more than face to face interviews because you have to represent yourself in a different way and I find that to be highly stressful. It still ticks me off that they wasted my time and didn't even bother to call and inform me before or during the time allotted for the phone interview to tell me the position was filled.

and finally...

* I got a call back yesterday for a job I applied for. She did some basic screening questions with me. Then she announced that I would have an interview today. Yes, announced. I wasn't asked if I could come in today or if it would work, she simply stated it as a fact.  As polite and apologetic as I could, I told her that I couldn't come in today or tomorrow as I was going to be out of town, but that I would be available all next week starting on Monday. There was silence for a second, she sighed and very bitchly said ""Well.. this is the ONLY day you can interview for this position.. so you need to decide if you want a shot at this position or if you want to go on a vacation.""   I was stunned and instantly pissed off.  When I applied for this position, I made a note somewhere on my application stating there are certain days in which I cannot interview. So clearly, she didn't bother reading the whole thing or she didn't care. 

Anyway, I went off on her. I said, ""I did not give you permission to talk to me like that. Frankly, I don't want to work with a company where they have someone as rude and bitchy as you recruiting people. And for your information, I am not going on vacation, I am going to see my Grandpa who is dying from Parkinsons."" And then I hung up on her. 

I realize I should have taken the high road on the last one, but it really just made me angry. 

Is this normal? I mean the shitty way employers seem to be treating applicants or do I just live in an area where everyone is rude?? 

**Edit: I'd like to point out that maybe the tone of this rant is being misinterpreted. I am not bitter or raging with anger, but rather, I am more shocked that this is happening. I also would like to mention that I realize I have not been looking for a job very long and I realize that some of you might have been looking longer. I apologize if my post/rant come off as being entitled or anything. I wrote it very early in the morning and I think I misrepresented my intentions. I wish you all luck in finding a job that you enjoy.** ",,False,,t5_2qhnd,1374784667.0,,,True,t3_1j0xwx,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1j0xwx/i_am_sick_of_employers_treating_applicants_like/,

I go to a top 5 school, have an excellent publication record in high impact journals, a nationally-recognized fellowship, and internships at top tech companies.  I figured few people would be able to match my resume, so I decided to not use my network to start and just see what is out there by applying online/going to career fairs.

What I found was shocking.  I had many phone interviews, and by far the most difficult ones were with mid-tier tech companies (companies well-known in the industry but maybe not to the public as a whole).  I was often quizzed during the very first contact.  Despite being very qualified for several of the positions in that I had previous work experience as well as related research, I had no on-site interviews from this group.  I also had phone interviews with a few top companies that were outside my network.  The phone screens tended to be less technical and more resume-focused, but I still only had one on-site interview, which went terribly.

Finally, after a few months, I was feeling really worthless with how the job search was going, so I began to ask old labmates and my old bosses at a particular top company what kinds of jobs were available.  I passed my resume onto them, and within a week, I had a hiring manager e-mail me for an *on-site* interview.  Not even a phone screen.  When I get on-site, my interviews consisted of either of very chummy people explaining how the weather was so great, or alumni from my school asking how so-and-so is.  There were very few technical questions.  It was as if an invisible hand was guiding me to this position, although I was no more qualified for it than previous countless jobs I had applied for at other companies.  The real kicker was that the salary they offered was about 20% higher than what I could have hoped for at another company.

I am still shocked at how much my network helped me land a job.  I honestly thought my qualifications would speak for themselves.  The whole process has made me sad.

Edit: There's a little bit of a misconception about what kinds of jobs EE PhD graduates get.  Although a PhD is required for many research positions, they are often preferred for senior design or development positions.  For example, my job title is a flavor of Senior Engineer, and the company required a PhD.  Whether or not one is actually required to perform the job is, of course, debatable.",,False,,t5_2qhnd,1365531727.0,,,True,t3_1bzmlz,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bzmlz/recent_phd_just_landed_a_job_still_shocked_at_the/,

I've heard of today's 20 somethings referred to time and time again as the ""Entitled Generation"" and other similar demeaning labels. I think when I was on my way to university this label maybe fit. I was brought up thinking that the process was to get a degree, get an entry level job, and work your way up from there. 

However, in my second year, 2008, I realized that the job market was going to be a little bit harder to get into than that, so I started to work harder. I began getting near-straight A's, I became vice president of my university newspaper, I got a high profile internship in the federal government. 

At the tail end of this internship in 2011 I began applying for jobs but received nothing, not even an offer for an interview for basic administration jobs, so I figured I'll have to work harder. I sank tens of thousands into earning an advanced MSc from a top European school, thinking that might give me the edge to get me a job where my basic duty would be answering phones and typing reports. However, at the conclusion of this degree, I still did not receive a single offer for a job interview.

I ended up going to work in China, where there were jobs and where I could add experience that might just give me that edge. After one year here, with the bank all over me and my $700 a month salary barely covering my minimum payments, I've been back applying to jobs in North America again, still nothing.

I'm ranting about my frustrations because I know I'm not the only one in this situation. Those that graduated with me last year all appear to be in similar positions, stringing together internships in the hopes that they might just catch on with someone eventually.

So I recently found an internship that looked pretty awesome and I figured it would help me hone some skills, learn some new ones, and help me figure out what to do in the meantime.

I had two interviews with the company and they loved me. I felt pretty good about the interview process and the company too. I said everything right until they told me that this interview only pays a $100/week stipend.

I told them that's fine, but I could only work 2 days a week at that amount because I'd have to keep another job to be able to live in New York City, where I'm currently at. They really liked me but by the end of the second interview they negotiated with me to try to get me to work 3 days a week. I did some quick math in my head and figured that I'd probably need to work a seven-day week at both the internship and my other job in order to manage that, but I really thought the internship would be worth it. They thanked me and said that I'd start a week from Monday.

Then after I send a thank-you note for their time, they send me an email that says they decided that they aren't actually going to consider me anymore--they want someone who can work Monday through Friday, 9am-5pm (40 hours a week). For a $100/week stipend??? No chance!!!

I wrote back and told them that this was not only ridiculous to expect a COLLEGE GRADUATE (they were only looking for college graduates!!!) to work that much a week and earn that little. I was so frustrated I even said to them that they were exploiting their interns if they expected that (I didn't receive quite a nice reply back haha).

Anyway. I KNOW as a college graduate I'm worth more than that, and this isn't even about being ENTITLED. The fact is, I would be making $2.50/hour, which is not at all even close to minimum wage, at a job that would give me some skills I could easily pick up at a fair-wage paying job.

All in all, I'd rather be underemployed for a few more months than slave away at a job that exploits its interns. I hope I'm not the only one who feels the same way. For all of you looking for jobs, trust me--I know it's tough because I'm going through it now too. But there is no way that as a human being with a college degree, or a human being in general, I can accept to work for $2.50 cents.",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_1jlfu5,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1jlfu5/anyone_else_sick_of_exploitative_internships/,

1342329459.0,188,self.jobs,wkysr,After being unemployed for 1.5 years I finally got hired. Here're some tips that helped:,221,33,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wkysr/after_being_unemployed_for_15_years_i_finally_got/,"1. Stopped smoking weed. I hate to admit it, but it was holding me back. I wasn't applying enough, I would make judgment errors when writing emails, and just in general wasn't motivated enough to really stand above the rest. p.s. I was a big time stoner, and just quit cold turkey once I was fed up with myself being un-productive.

2. I attended a resume building workshop and re-did mine. The main thing was to condense a 2 page resume into one jam packed with all the info. In a nutshell: white space on a resume is dead space. Fill it!

3. At the top of my resume I had 3 lines that I would edit slightly for every new job position I'd apply for. Including a title, right under my name that would clearly state **&lt;position title i'm applying for&gt; for &lt;company name&gt;** in the lines I would list some key skills I'm proficient in that directly speak to the job requirements

4. started mailing Thank You cards by snail mail. I would thank the person who interviewed me, but also add a legibly hand written paragraph on some extra stuff i would bring to the position that wasn't in the resume. Like Enthusiasm and ability to mesh well with the team. And also a personal sentence that speaks to the specific person I am sending it to. 
In fact, this job offer I got, was one that I knew from the phone interview that I had in the bag. And this time, I mailed the thank you card to the HR lady instead of the interviewers. I mailed it before I accepted the offer (was waiting to hear back from other companies so I kept them waiting a week). After I accepted, she got me a higher offer without me even asking for more money. I attribute this to the card I sent.

5. Changed the way I did phone interviews. I prepared canned answers for the usual questions one gets, like: Tell us about yourself. What would you bring to the table? How much money do you want? I followed the tips on this site: 
http://www.pongoresume.com/articleTopics/29/interviews.cfm

6. Utilize cover letters. My cover letter has the same header and fonts as my resume. First paragraph is about what I'm applying for, mentioning I am experienced and establishing interest in the company and position. Stating I'd be a strong addition to the team. Second paragraph is how my experience is relevant, and more examples of how I could help the company. Third paragraph is the ""call to action"" offering my resume, link to my reel, and request to prove myself worthy.

7. Before an interview I would spend 1-3 hours researching the company, past projects, successes, press releases. And if I knew who would be interviewing me, research the people them selves. LinkedIn is a great resource for that.

8. Network. 
 - LinkedIn. If you have a decent LinkedIn network you can see if you know anyone at companies you're interested in. If you don't you can still get introduced to them by people you do know.
 -  Strangers. I would approach strangers, politely, if I thought I heard them talk about something relating to my field and introduce myself.
 - Attend job fairs, conventions, expos. Come prepared with resumes and dressed professionally. 
 - Utilize your school's job placement department.
 - Basically try and use every resource you can think of at your disposal to get the scoop about jobs in your area, and/or to get your resume seen by them.

Edit: added 6-7.
Edit 2: added 8

The job I got is my first ever officially Senior titled position, with a salary to match. 

Hope this helps!

",214,39,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/110obe/got_my_dream_job_at_a_fortune_100_company_without/,"A little backstory. I posted this earlier this year. http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vezi8/rjobs_i_need_some_advice/

I am an engineer with a master’s degree. And in this economy it is hard to find a job. Since r/jobs has helped me out a lot, I thought I’d give back.


**Before applying for jobs.**

* Lock up your social networking sites except LinkedIn (facebook, twitter etc.) from public eye. 
* Update your  LinkedIn. Open this to the public.
* Update your resume.
* Schedule an hour a day for job application until you get an offer.


**During job application**

* Mass application kind of works. I applied for 168 jobs on a Saturday. This took 10 hours. 
I received 3 phone interviews out of which were one of the companies I recently got hired into.
* Be honest 
* Writing cover letters suck but a customized one for each company works.
* Resume should NOT contain pictures, references and general skills (good learner, hardworking etc)
* Resume SHOULD contain your technical skills, education, work experience (projects in case of recent graduates), your address, certifications, and phone number.
* When applying for jobs in your field, make sure you use key words relating to the job. For example, a mechanical engineer may use AutoCAD or Solidworks as a skill. This will help in getting those damn resume parsers to catch your resume.
* Make sure your spelling and grammar are perfect. NO COMPROMISE.  
* Use auto form filler like RoboForm to make your life easier.


**Phone interview**

* When scheduling a phone interview, choose a time when you are completely free and in a noise free environment. This scheduling would give you time to research the company.
* Make sure your charge up your cellphone battery. (I lost an opportunity when my cellphone battery died DURING an interview)
* Address the interviewer by name.
* Be prepared to describe your current situation, what you are looking for and what you can do for the company.
* Ask at least 4 questions relating to the job. 
* Ask what the next steps are. 


**During an actual interview.**
 
* Dress and look smart. First impressions are absolutely important.
* Be relaxed and provide the interviewer with your resume and a visual resume (google it).
* Provide the resumes in a folder with your name labeled to it.
* Again be prepared to describe what you are looking for and what you can do for the company based on the job description.
* Give firm handshakes.
* Always be honest and confident while answering questions. If you do not know a something, say you don’t know. Employers can easily figure out if you are making stuff up.
* Always remember to get their business card.
* Send a thank you email within 8 hours of the interview.


**Post interview**

* If you do not hear back from them in a week’s time, email them for an update. 


Waiting is part of the game. I had to wait for about 3 months before I received an offer.
Hope this helps. Good Luck on your search. If you have tips I may have missed, please post them.


**EDIT:** [One day one job](http://www.onedayonejob.com/) is a great tool for entry level grads.

Shortly thereafter, I received an invitation to interview for a MUCH better position with a different company. I just graduated from college, and this interview is for my dream job.

Silver lining is I think I will get an offer for this dream job! I'll hear back from the hiring manager later this week.

&gt; In the meantime, it is time for the next step. As we mentioned in the application, this position is all about having a ""get things done attitude"" and right now I really need your help getting something done. Specifically, we are making some big decisions in the coming weeks about Artsicle's next steps and need as much input as possible from artists all over the country. We've created a survey to be used as a baseline for interviewing artists.  I've included details below - shoot me a note when your interviews have come through. 

&gt;Details: Interview 6-12 artists located in the US (but outside of NYC). There are about 20 questions in the survey below, which you can ask in person or on the phone, or you can email the survey. We don't want to blast this (no social media please), but you can cast a wide net to friends, family, hometown, etc and the type of artist can vary as long as the work is visual (vs performance). 

It looks to me like the company is trying to use eager intern applicants to conduct free market research. I don't mind writing a few pages or completing a small task to show off my skills (start-ups routinely give a real-world performance test), but this is taking advantage and perhaps the worst business ethics I have ever seen.

I also have an AA degree in General Studies. I decided to attempt to land a job, as I've read about how grad school can end up not being cost effective, and I lack ideas for what program I want to join.

Every day, I go on CareerBuilder and do searches. I usually apply to 2-15 different jobs depending on how busy I am that day. Thus far, I have landed a few phone interviews, only two in-person interviews, and have gotten a ton of emails usually stating *""We have chosen to pursue candidates that better match the job qualifications.""*

I currently work the grocery store job I have had since age 17 (I'm 22 now). Every day I show up there kills my self esteem and makes me feel like shit for busting my ass and paying for a useless degree.

I haven't been helpless in this, in addition to CareerBuilder, I have been recently started going to temp agencies to find a job. I had my resume critiqued and revamped it. I've done my research on how to write a winning cover letter and how to conduct myself in an interview (phone and in person.) I've also been networking to try to find something, but so far no nibbles.

When I job hunt it appears I am unqualified for everything that requires a BA. Psychology jobs don't pay much more than my grocery store job (uggh) and all others require experience that I do not have.

The way I see it, I have a few choices. 

* I can either keep applying like a mad man and losing my soul working a job I'm extremely overqualified for.
* I can join the Navy to serve my country. (Quickly becoming a very attractive option, but I don't want it to be a fallback plan--that's dishonorable.)
* I can pursue my Masters in something and possibly be in the same pickle in 2-4 years.
* I can give up, drink and smoke myself silly, and die.

Basically, fuck! What would you all do in my situation? Does anyone have any advice?

**Edit:** In the mean time I guess I'll add that I started bettering myself. I've been doing NoFap, quit all of my habits, started weightlifting/getting more fit, and have been more active.

**Edit2:** This has gotten a lot more replies than I thought it would. I thank you all for the wonderful advice, viewpoints, criticism, and stories you have shared. It's been an eye-opener for me and I'm extremely fired up now. There is hope, especially with hard work!

Nightmare interview rant.",182,29,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11emsd/well_i_just_got_super_fucked_by_a_middle_school/,"I was called for an interview for a middle school English position in Hillsborough County, FL on Wednesday. They wanted to interview me Friday (today). Usually with education, if you get an interview you're doing pretty well. The woman understood that I would be driving for quite some time (I told her it was a 7+ hour drive) and she still implied that it would behoove me to interview. She said that the principal was very interested in my app. After a couple more phone calls which seemed very positive, I took the interview. I thought I had it in the bag. 

I drove seven hours to get there. Seven. Fucking. Hours. When I got to the school, I had a very cold reception. The secretary who had sounded so cheery over three phone calls didn't even look me in the eye as she handed me a clipboard and said ""Fill this out.""  No hello, no ""How was your drive?"" When I met the principal, it was pretty much the same. She asked, ""Drove from Georgia, huh?"" I detected no warmth. After some brief chit chat,  the principal told me I was under qualified before the interview began in earnest. I was, of course, confused and said ""If you look in the system, I'm listed as qualified."" She took offense to this, looked me up, saw that I was qualified, and continued to go on about how I wasn't qualified. All questions she asked me, she wouldn't allow me to answer. I don't remember much of the questions because I was too busy realizing that my long drive was for naught. I do know that I would start answering questions and she would keep interrupting me to say that it was useless to try and use ""educational jargon"" and she just kept talking about how she's an expert at rooting out ineffective teachers, how much hiring power she has in the district, and how, again,  I am under qualified.

I was able to answer one question. My answer ended with me saying that I would always try to engage in discourse with the students. After another rant from her about ineffective teachers, she said that I wouldn't be an effective teacher because I didn't say anything about engaging the students in conversation. 

She then told me that she had four or five way more qualified applicants. 

It became quite clear that this job was not going to be mine. I asked (politely) why she couldn't have done a preliminary phone interview, and said that I shouldn't have had to  drive 7 hours to be told I wasn't qualified. A phone call would have sufficed. She got very offended by this, and said (and I quote) ""Well the way this conversation is going, it really doesn't look like you'll get this job"". That was quite obvious. She went on to imply that her time was too valuable (unlike my worthless 15 hours of driving and three days missed subbing work) to be bothered with anything like phone interviews and qualification checking. She then told me to get my head straight before I applied to any more jobs in the district. 

She also said that she ""didn't even know what I looked like"" until I got there (I'm Asian, she's black... Wish I had a tape recorder going). 

I called human resources afterwards and told them all this. They checked my file and confirmed that I was, indeed, qualified. The gentleman who heads up HR seemed equally confused and said that he would discuss the matter with the principal and invited me to speak with him the first week of Nov. (when I move down) so that he can talk to me and then call his principal friends to try and help get me a job.

Most of this applies to anyone looking for work, not just the new kids on the block.  As a bit of background, I'm an HR professional who has done more than my fair share of interviewing and hiring at all levels, and also someone who has been out of work for an extended period of time before.  I may not know everything, but I'm not new to this.  Some of this is constructive advice, some is a bit of tough love, so without further ado

**1)  If you think you don't have a job right now, you're wrong.**  Looking for work is a full-time job.  I just don't have the time should not be a part of your vocabulary.  You should be scanning every web-based job board on a daily basis, set up search alerts for new postings, research the companies that you apply to.  Research companies you want to apply to that aren't hiring yet.  Set up a Linked In profile and see who you know that's connected to any jobs and ask them for ideas.  Go to networking events, mixers, whatever.  Customize cover letters for every application.  If you're done with your search and on reddit by noon, you're doing it wrong.  That being said, don't burn yourself out either.  It's ok to take weekends off or sleep in.  If you're in a negative cycle, take some time to yourself to get in a better state of mind before you dive back in.  

**2)  But it's been FOUR MONTHS!**  Job searches take time and patience, especially in the current economy.  Everyone, including hiring managers, know this by now, so don't be afraid that your resume is now ""stale"".  And keep that in mind when you get discouraged or think that certain strategies aren't paying off.  These things take a long time.  During the mid-2000s, I read a study that said that for every $10,000 in annual salary you want, your job search will take a month.  Meaning it would take an average of 4 months (during the biggest economic boom since the end of WW2) to find a job that pays $40,000/year.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess it takes longer than that now.

**3)  Network your butt off.**  Seriously, go out and find a meeting, invite someone out for coffee.....ANYTHING, just so long as you do it.  The single greatest asset you can have in a job search is someone who will vouch for you.  The more people you know, the better your chances are.  Find groups in your area that cater to your field and go to every meeting you can.  If there's more than one, join them all.  Make it your goal to leave every meeting with at least 5 business cards from people you didn't know before.  Call or email all of them, make dates for coffee or lunch or an in depth phone conversation.  Ask questions.

**4)  Know the difference between networking and begging.**  Despite how you may feel, plenty of people would actually love to help you, they just don't know how.  Most of them don't have a job they can just offer up.  But they do have knowledge, experience, advice, constructive criticism and a network of other people you might want to know.  Ask about those things; tell them you're just trying to learn and develop yourself.  And have a perspective or a specific area of interest to ask them about.  Even if you have no idea what sort of job you want, ask them about whatever industry and position they're in as if that's the exact job you want.  Nobody will ever know if you're lying.  And remember that flattery, while totally shameless, is also incredibly effective.

**5)  Just because you aren't STEM, doesn't mean you're useless.**  It seems that conventional wisdom around here is that if you don't have a job, go get a CS degree.  For most people, that's an awful idea.  Education is great, and if you can get it, I encourage it, but just because you have a philosophy degree and like using the internet, doesn't mean you'll enjoy being a database architect, or be able to find a job as one.  If your life's dream is to work with computers all day, then by all means get to it.  But if you're simply unsure of what you want to do, don't sign up for 4 years of school and a mountain of expenses because some programmer on a web forum told you he makes six figures and nobody at his office understands how to do his job, so he's unfireable.  There are easier ways to get a job you don't really care about.  

**6)  Appearance and attitude count.**  Dress the part and be pleasant.  It's astonishing how many people still don't understand this.  If you're going into an office building for an interview, wear a suit.  And for pete's sake, act like you're happy to be there.  You are, aren't you?  I mean, this is the first interview you've had in 2 months and the pay is $10,000 a year more than you'd need to cover your bills....shouldn't that be exciting enough to elicit the occasional smile.  

**7) You aren't special (on paper.)**  I see a lot of posts asking ""how do I convey in my cover letter that I'm the type of person who does X?""  The honest answer is you probably can't.  When reading applications and resumes, all a hiring manager is thinking is ""What proof do I have that this person can do this job?""  If you've got the experience, then hard-sell.  Play it up and re-write your resume to include whatever keywords are in the job ad.  Either you have that kind of work history or you don't, but this is where networking can really help.  Simply saying you're a hard worker doesn't count for much, but if Shelly from Accounts Receivable says ""I know a guy who'd be great for this, he's a hard working dude"" you may find yourself getting a phone call.

This is a bit long, but I beg you to read it:

I was listening to a report on NPR where they looked into the rampant unemployment.  They interviewed a man who said that *everyone* on his street was unemployed.

I started thinking about how that entire neighborhood could save itself, if all those poor families pooled their resources, sold all their houses and bought a small hotel which they could all live in and operate.

It then occurred to me that in many ways, reddit is a tighter community than most neighborhoods.  I certainly interact more with you folks than I ever have with my next door neighbors.

So what if all us unemployed/underemployed redditors pooled our resources and skills and tried to start some sort of business?

In this day and age we all can pretty much agree that offices and face-to-face communication are not at all necessary for a business.  We could all (potentially) play vital roles from wherever we call home.

I'm an attorney, and I believe I could deal with the legal aspects of setting up an organization/corporation (though I would be learning on the job).

If we all are willing to do some work for free (I know I am), who knows what we could build?

So how about it folks?  What skills do you have that you could contribute?  Does anyone have an idea of what services we could perform or what products we could create?

I'm certain that there are dozens, likely *hundreds* of redditors out there who have very impressive skills that are completely wasted in the current economy.

I guarantee that among us there are underemployed web-designers, graphic artists, etc., who could give us a very respectable and professional web presence.  I also guarantee that the *employed* reddit community would likely help us in our endeavors, buying any goods or services we could reliably offer.

I think we have a real opportunity to be the first online community to do what *""real""* communities have done in the past... pool resources based on nothing but common geography.  Except that our common geography exists only in cyberspace (excuse the 90's terminology).

So please, redditors, if this is a project you're interested in starting with me, tell us all what your skills are, and share any ideas you might have.

I have Tourette Syndrome and was forced to quit my job at Ihop last month after my manager began drastically cutting my hours and making me feel guilty for having having Tourettes. When my tics started my manager asked me how long they lasted and I told them they varied. I did not curse, or hit or anything awful I made simple squeaking sounds one every few minutes and most customers and employees never did seem to mind. When my tics started ( They got bad from stress of the holidays ) My hours were drastically cut from 35 to about 20 hours a week and kept going down. If I came to work and my tourettes began flaring up ( Which again this never seemed to bother the customers ) I would be sent home. As a waitress making only 1.55 an hour, I would sometimes come to work make only 3 dollars in tips and be sent home. Ihop took out 58 cent an hour out of my check for employee meals yet In five months of working their I could count on two hands or less how many breaks I was actually given. My manager harassed me about my tourettes making it seem like if I didn't get better he'd fire me. I once even heard him say "" I've been giving her crappy sections hoping she would quit. "" to an assistant manager. The final straw was a Thursday night, knowing my tourettes were bad my assistant manager let me stay there, as he hardly ever sent me home. I was scheduled for the next day and needed the money but I knew the general manager would be working. I kindly left him a note telling him that my tics were bad but I wanted desperately to come work and if he would allow me to stay the entire day to please call me cause I could no longer afford the gas to come to work only to be sent home with 2 - 3 dollars in my pocket. He never called, and that is when I realized if I was going to have tourettes, they did not want me there. It was actually costing me at that point to come to work. I was loosing money on the gas, versus how much I was having to make and I ended up having to quit last month. Now even with three years of college, excellent computer skills, and communications skills, I am without a job.

In some cases these can be great characteristics for career fields; however, they can also lead to poor job security. I was let go as an Assistant Health Services Coordinator for the Orthopedic Division of a large hospital due to a dramatic increase in budget cuts. When I was first let go, all of my friends and family tried giving support by saying I will find another job and not to worry, you’re in the healthcare field! There are tons of healthcare jobs! This may be true for many people, but I am not an RN or LPN; I am ultimately an acting manager within the healthcare industry, with less than 2 years of experience outside of my degree. 

I immediately began applying to every relevant position I saw, including a few which were half way across the country. After 4 months and roughly 80 applications, I received my first call back – only to be shot down on the spot because they were looking for 5+ years of experience when it clearly stated 2 on the job position. Another 10 months go by and I literally started to hit rock bottom and losing hope. I realized there was something wrong with my process, and needed to try a new approach. All of the career advice blogs and websites said networking is key to finding your career. Yes, of course networking is important… but how the hell do you begin to network when you don’t know anyone in your career field? I started by telling everyone that I was looking for a job. Everyone. Every family member, friend, cashier, bar tender, and waitress I encountered found out that I was looking for a job. It started to surprise me how often someone would say that they know someone with a relevant career as to which I was searching for. 

A cashier at my local grocery store had a cousin which worked as a hiring manager for a regional hospital. The cashier gave me their contact information, and I drove home with rising hope. I started to email my cover letter and resume to the hiring manager when I realized that my resume may be another result to my nearly non-existent call backs. I searched for a few ideas and [found a resume template here](http://www.kukook.com/CVTemplates/Executive/tabid/97/ProdID/24/CatID/11/Executive_CV_1.aspx) that was already populated with Healthcare information. So I downloaded it, modified it with my information, and sent it over. I was called in for an interview 3 days later, and was once again employed 2 weeks after that.


**My Advice:** Network by telling EVERYONE you are looking for a job, perfect your resume, and don't get discouraged. You will find one...

**Edit:** I'll clarify a little that I am certainly not calling myself a professional at job searching. I simply changed my approach. I originally started by scouring Monster, Careerbuilder, Indeed, etc for new listings and sending my resume and realized that didn't work, so I went on to networking. I also believe my choice of resume had a great response.

6ish weeks ago, I hate my job. My new manager is making me miserable. I need to get away from this person and this company. I start looking. I take a few interview calls and they all go well.

There is one specific company that I have several phone screens with. They all go well. This is over the span of a week. I get invited to go on site for 3 hours (during a work day) at this really amazing company. One you all interact with every day. It goes really well.

I get back to my office, and my manager tells me at the end of the day that they have heard what's been going on (seeking new job, planning resignation) and that its time to part ways. I had one foot out the door and the manager beat me to it. Crap now I have no job, and if any of my other interviews fail I'm totally screwed.

The next day I'm invited back to another round at said amazing company. At this point I haven't signed any termination papers, agreements, etc. I'm feeling completely dejected, low, crappy, numb. The firing was really traumatic for me. 

I ask everyone I know if I should mention what happened. People who recruit, people in hr roles, people I know who had the same job as me, etc. Everyone says the same thing: don't volunteer the information. If you are explicitly asked, tell them.

Makes sense to me.

No one explicitly asks me if I'm still at the other company. I explain ""the reason I started looking for a new job is (insert why I wasn't happy)""

Interviews go well. I land a new job a day after getting fired, making way more money, and a company everyone knows. I accept. I fill out the paper work for a bg check, and am honest about all dates, and specify that I am currently self employed.

I start working there.

3 weeks in I am confronted by a manager that interviewed me at my second onsite (after I got fired). Manager somehow heard what happened at last gig. Said manager claims that I was not forthcoming and should not have beaten around the bush. Should have just explicitly laid it out. I apologize, over and over, explain exactly what happened at my last job, and say I can provide dozens of references from the last company to corroborate what happened. Literally got fired because I was interviewing at the company I now work at. Didn't know what to do. Didn't want anyone to feel bad for me. 

Manager understands the position I was in. But still, has to think about it.

Thinks about it. Decides to fire me.

Broken. 

What now? Do I tell every single person that interviews me what happened at both situations? Do I just tell the recruiters? What if they ask what I've been doing in between job 1 and now (since job 2 won't be on the resume, obviously)? Job 2 will show up on the background check, so there isn't really any hiding it. Also, which is my priory salary? Job 1 or 2?

I studied hard in high school, went to the best university in the state. Luckily, I got a few scholarships to cover some of the costs, but also got a few loans because ""hey whats a few hundred a month, when you're making 43k a year"" (average starting salary of my major when I started college (now its 27k)).

I graduated with honors, participated in a few clubs and organizations, and worked all the years I was in college. Sure it was waiting tables, and irrelevant to any career, but I was in college, THAT IS THE TIME YOU HAVE A WAITING JOB. My major doesn't even have internship opportunities until the summer after your JR year, and they were all unpaid, which I couldn't afford.

After graduating I knew I was entering a tough economy, but I've spent months, upon months, upon months, searching, finally a few months ago I found a customer service rep position paying $10 an hour for 25 hours a week, which was getting me by at the time, until, get this, I was laid off. Wanna know why I was laid off, because of the sudden increase everyone could work in summer now that they are out of school (I was the newest one, and my employers knew I wasn't in it for the long haul). Now I'm about 2 months away from my first student loan payment, and I'm struggling to know where my next meal comes from.

I'm tired of submitting resumes, tired of writing cover letters, tired of phone interviews, and the occasionally crushing in person interview where I am let down.

My last day of college was on May 9th 2011. I have been unemployed for 46 days.
 
**Step 1 - Resume:**

My resume was 1.5 pages. I wanted to include everything so I started submitting my resume to online job boards. And no response…
I did research on how to perfect my resume and stumbled upon “resumes should not be more than 1 page”. It needed to be shorter...
I work in advertising and know the best way to get your message across; limit the amount of words and make sure each word is “powerful”. This is where I needed to be creative.

**TOOL #1:TWITTER!**
You can only send 140 characters at one time, right? 
I opened up Twitter and copy and pasted each resume bullet point into the “What’s Happening?” box to see how many words I had used and reduced the words to fit into the 140 characters mark. Using this tool helped me re-word all of my bullet points and reduced my resume from 1.5 pages to 1 page with room to spare.
I continued to tweak my resume and knew I had hit the “golden resume” when I was contacted by a recruiter a day after I submitted my resume. 

**Timeline:** The resume process took me about a month.

**TOOL #2:LinkedIn Job Seeker Account**

The premium version is a MUST! It’s ~$35 a month and I had it for 2 months. Why? It allows you to contact recruiters – I got multiple phone interviews by using InMail feature asking recruiters if positions were still available. Sometimes they responded and other times they didn’t, but it helped me be proactive. 
The paid subscription allowed me to be a *“featured applicant”*, if I applied directly through LinkedIn my resume would be “at the top” for recruiters to see. Just another way for me to stand out – I don’t know if it worked or not, but hey I didn’t have anything to lose.
 
**TOOL #3:Google Docs Spreadsheet**
I used Google Docs to help keep track of all:
*dates of when I submitted the resume, 
*position applied for
* link to job description
*notes on who I talked to, the position and how I felt. 

**Step 2 – Phone Interviews**

I made sure I was in a quiet area, with a clear desk, resume for applied position and job description printed out. 
This is my weird tidbit but hey it worked!
*I did vocal warm-ups about 15 minutes before each call. I googled “tongue twisters” and read them aloud to warm up my voice. It helped. 
*I made sure I was dressed well, complete with a button up shirt and tie. 
These little things helped me feel more comfortable, and of course, tried my best to smile while on the phone. 
If I felt like I messed up I always made sure to write down what it was so I could make sure I didn't make the same mistake twice.
At the end of each call, ALWAYS ask what the next steps are! 

**Step 3 – In-Person Interviews**

Ok, this is where I screwed up.
After my 1st, 2nd, 3rd in-person interview I was starting to wonder why I was not getting any offers. I sent follow up emails to all of the recruiters and 2/3 responded with “they were looking for someone with more experience”. 
I was confused because I had gotten my resume looked at, had phone calls with recruiters but despite all of that success I was not getting any offers – what the heck?!

**I realized I was the problem.**

I was not prepared for the interviews. Maybe it was because I was so drained from trying to be perfect on the resume and phone interviews that I thought “if I got this far, its going to be easy now”. 
I had read behavior questions online and knew the basics of what was going to be asked when I went in, but I didn't practice - I thought I could ""do it on the fly"".

My problem was my inability to articulate EXACTLY what I had accomplished when interviewing. I struggled to answer questions like “how do you manage your time?” or “this position relies on analyzing lots of data, how would you go about this?”

I would answer with “well I used checklists, calendars, and my watch to keep track of the time…” and “I look at data all the time currently, so its part of my daily routine…”

These answers were not SPECIFIC; they were general, and frankly poor answers. So, I spent **hours** practicing interview questions with specific examples. I worked on communicating my answers as fluently as possible, working on getting rid of the “ums” and “uhhhs”. I worked on getting straight to the point and not rambling. 

My 4th interview I tested the waters with my new approach, I went into the interview with research to present to them and tried to answer questions professionally. I was still weak in being specific but felt like I was slowly improving.

My 5th interview was when it all came together. I spent the weekend researching and learning all I could about the product/business – I even wrote a blog post about it and made sure to bring copies to the interview. But most importantly, I worked on communicating my answers with specific examples.

I went into the 5th interview **PREPARED!**
I answered all the questions with “…sure, for example when I was working at XYZ I did THIS and THAT which resulted in THIS…”. 

Practicing and practicing some more, I worked on my weakness to the point where I no longer considered it a weakness. And it worked! 

A day later I was contacted and offered/accepted the job.

Find a job ad. Respond to job ad. Go to LinkedIn and see if I have connections there (ie. know someone who knows someone). If I knew someone I asked for an introduction. If I didn't I looked for either the hiring manager, if I knew who they would be, or someone in the department I was applying to. I would then stalk them to find their work email address (or guess it) and use a verification tool to validate it, if possible. I then wrote a personalized email about myself, offering to meet for coffee, etc.

I didn't do this for every job. I applied to numerous jobs every day, but only positions that were either really good fits or I was excited about would get this treatment, since it is so time intensive.

I also extended the formula by making a list of companies I want to work for and seeing if they had open positions in my line of work. Whether they did or not, I got in touch with someone on the inside and introduced myself.

I used a fairly generic résumé that I adapted slightly only to the opportunities where I was really interested in the job. I also had a generic cover letter I adapted slightly as well. 

I work in the marketing industry and somewhat senior level. I moved from a mid-size city (Portland, OR) to San Francisco four months into my unemployment for more opportunities. In Portland I didn't get any interest at all. In SF I had five interviews within the first month so this was an excellent choice.

The new position pays more than I expected, though it comes with a two hour daily commute.

To those still looking, please stay strong...remember that lifelong employment is a thing of the past and we will all suffer through bouts of unemployment for the rest of our lives, so we need to stay adaptable, bold, and keep a healthy cash reserve. And network like motherfuckers.

I won't be going back.

There were so many examples of his idiocy throughout the day, but it was his rudeness and lack of professionalism that take the cake.  There were three new hires, we all sat for three hours today waiting for him to show up. 

I asked another employee if he had a manual on how to use the phones, or any of the equipment in the office that I could read while we were waiting. Nope.  Nothing.  So we sat and waited.  I ended up cleaning Maria's office and realized that she left behind all kind of mementos, that she likely just walked out of the job. No mother leaves behind their handmade Mother's Day card from their kid.

We got no explanation for the delay except that he was in ""a fucking meeting about Maria.""

We were told to watch the company policy videos (30 minutes) and I pointed out to him that none of the computers had speakers. He told me all knew hires had to sign a statement saying they watched the videos, so I had to sit through them without sound.  There was no text or graphics on the screen.

Then I was trying to email the corporate attorney some much needed information he had been requesting for two weeks, and the email wouldn't work.  My ""boss"" said that email was overrated and I should just rely on the telephone.  I'm not kidding.  ""You're not Wadsworth, call the guy.""

Every time I would ask him a question about something very basic, he would respond that I didn't need to know that. When I suggested I really did since a client was asking, he told me I should just make up whatever would get them off the phone quicker.

There are tons more examples, but the whip cream on the turd was when he yelled at me as I was leaving.

I'll be sending him an email tonight and telling him I won't be in tomorrow or ever.

Can't see the point of going on.,126,21,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bxb6e/mature_university_student_feeling_incredibly_down/,"I lost my job back in 2010 at 26 years of age. I drove a forklift in a warehouse. The factory closed down around the same time I inherited about $40,000. I had no qualifications so I saw it as an opportunity to go to university to make a better life for myself.

I'm now 29 years old and coming to the end of my third year in university, after this summer I have one more year to go before I graduate in 2014. 

I recently interviewed for a summer internship where 40 positions were available. I was told by HR they interviewed 45 people and I still couldn't get the fucking job. I would take a guess and say most of the 45 people interviewed were 20-22 years of age with little work experience.

Since leaving high school over ten years ago I've had 10-15 interviews for entry level office jobs and I've never once got a job or a second interview. Last year alone, I had 4 interviews and didn't ever get a response. Any job I've ever worked was manual work through a family member or friend.

This last rejection hit me the hardest as I had almost a 90% chance of landing an internship and for once getting a break and I still couldn't get it. Even though my grades are good I'm starting to question whats the point. I obviously come across terrible in interviews so when I finally graduate at 30 I'll have no professional experience just low end manual work so I'll probably struggle to get a job then too.

On top of this I'm single, money is tight and I live hours away from my few friends and family. All I really seem to do now is study and go to the gym.

Can anyone offer me some advice?",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_1bxb6e,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bxb6e/mature_university_student_feeling_incredibly_down/,

They didn't understand the frustration from not being able to contribute, from interviewers/offers failing to follow through or even just being dishonest, or the hopelessness that can set in.

I feel like a total failure, and I'm only 2 years out of college, so I don't have much experience with this. Any help is appreciated, but please don't reprimand me for how it happened — I already know full well I shouldn't have done it.

**The Story:** I worked at the corporate HQ for a large company known nationwide in the US. When this happened, I was there for about 3 months, which is considered a decent amount of time to be employed there since most people were recently hired.

Last week, our team had a company outing. There was drinking before and during the event at a bar and at the venue. We all knew drinks would be expensive during the event because of the venue. To get around this, I managed to bring in my own drink from outside into the venue for myself and other members of my team, even though the venue does not allow outside beverages. Some of my coworkers and I drank what I brought and had a good time. I didn't think much of it since others seemed to enjoy it.

The next day, my boss (who was at the event with me and knew what happened) approached me saying that his boss had found out about it. I didn't know that what happened was a real problem for the company considering my boss seemed ok with it, so I felt shocked and embarrassed to hear this. Yet he assured me that this was just a mistake, he would take care of it, and everything would be ok.

Two days later, I get called into my boss' boss' office, along with someone from HR sitting in. Without them giving me any chance to explain that I had no intention to violate company policy, they said they were letting me go. Then a loss prevention guy came in, took my badge, and led me out of the building. It was the most humiliating experience of my life.

Now, I just feel crushed and cheated. I never knew such a small mistake (in my mind) could lead to such consequences. I would have never done it if I knew it violated company rules. This all happened yesterday and I have no idea what to make of it. I'm 24 years old and I know that this will not be good for my career in many ways, even if I can get interviews...

What do I tell future employers if they ask if I've ever been fired? Do I tell the truth or lie?

When employers ask where I'm currently working and I say ""I'm unemployed"", what do I say to justify it?

What do I tell my friends and family when they ask what happened?

**TL;DR: I was fired for bringing alcohol into a venue where outside beverages aren't allowed during a company outing. After the meeting where I was fired, they made me leave before I even had a chance to explain myself.  I don't know how to find another job without being currently employed.**

Something I seem to get a lot, almost always word for word is ""McDonalds is always hiring"". This phrase seems to be pretty common, to the point where I think people honestly believe it to be some sort of universal truth, here are some reasons and thoughts as to why this is not true, and if you say it; please stop.

1. The one McDonalds in my area, after talking with management, gets roughly 80 applications per each open position. Taking this information, we can also gather that, on average, roughly 79 people did NOT get the job. 

2. McDonalds tends to specifically search for one end of the employment extreme or the other. What I mean is that they either target people with prior experience in food services OR people with no job experience. The reasoning behind this is that people with no prior experience are easy to mold, and that people with prior food service experience bring a sort of perceived value.

People in the middle of the road however have both of these working against each other.

3. Possessing post secondary education really of any kind seems to also work against you. It is not unusual to not get hired due to the belief that you will not say long, even if in practice this is not true.

These are some of my thoughts on the subject. Any others? ",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_1ez3rg,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ez3rg/anyone_else_tired_of_the_mcdonalds_is_always/,

I'm family friends with one of the people that works there.  Here's what he had to say ""You were the top candidate, most impressive, most qualified, and by far the most prepared.  You were on the very top of our list and there were long, heated discussions about your opportunity here but we picked two other candidates simply because they lived in the area.""

Even though I tailor my resume to each workplace I apply to even if it is a entry-level job (McDonalds at the least.) I have also four years of general volunteering services (From kitchen assistant to grounds maintenance) and I always check up on my application after turning it in consistently. But to no avail I never have gotten a job, except for an internship for a camp that already knows who I am as a person.

Now I want to move on from my internship and find a job elsewhere, it's been a month of job hunting and thirty applications later called in each business and about 3/4th of the places I applied to just hired the position.

So I worried about the smaller things like my ethnicity and age. Those things were way off and just after making an earlier post on here decided to see what would come up if I googled myself. When I did I found multiple profiles in sites such as Formspring, FB, Bebo and Myspace that I had made in middle school and my first two years of high school that are pretty embarrassing. Most of them consisted of things I wouldn't even associate myself with now and didn't remember having until now. I realized that a simple google search probably prevented myself from getting a job for the past three years.

I already have emailed most of those websites to see if I can deactivate all of my old accounts as I had lost all of my passwords to those profiles. Anything else I have not done?

The company I work for has been circling the drain since I started back in November. I'm heading up their collections department. I send invoices, call customers, do customer service for follow up jobs, take payments, the whole shebang. In January,the CEO, my boss, asked me to try to collect from a customer in bankruptcy. I flat out refused and told him that no one else in the company could solicit the customer for payment either. I've also explained the rules and procedures for repossession, which he has flat out ignored. 

Before repossessing equipment on an account, we have to notify the customers of why they're out for repo and give them a chance to pay. Instead, the CEO has been telling technicians to just show up and either get money or equipment without the notification. He did this without my knowledge. When I found out I immediately called the office (I work from home, 200 miles away form the office) and told him that he can't repo people without notification, again. He straight up told me that he didn't care if what he was doing is illegal and he would do whatever he possibly could to get money. If I didn't like it, I could find another job. 

I think that was the final nail in my coffin. I'm pretty sure its only a matter of time before he fires me for not being a ""yes man"". What the hell do I do? I have documentation of this through email. If he fires me can I still collect unemployment?

So, I sent an email to HR stating that I want to figure out a way that I can leave with both parties being happy. They stated that they were willing to let me resign with the reason being ""incompatible situation"". This means that I can quit and still receive unemployment benefits, COBRA, a month of continued health care and other benefits. I also stated in the letter again that my boss made me work a day during FMLA without any threatening language around it. 

Today I agreed to the terms of separation and put in my resignation asking for 3 weeks continued employment so I have enough time to iron out another working situation. HR got back to me and said they are willing to let me go today with 3 weeks severance under the situation stated above. I emailed my new company and told them I will be available Monday. They said to give them a week to get things setup and that they are very happy to have me aboard. 

Anyway, thank you tons r/jobs. You let me know if I really had any legal hook into my old company and great advice about how to leave. If I had not negotiated the terms of leaving I would have not qualified for any benefits after leaving nor any amount of severance. 

Great situation for everyone!

There's nothing overly amazing about the role, but it provides interesting work, a good salary and flexible conditions.

We typically get 80 or so applications when we advertise, but this time we received almost 200. Probably indicative of the job market here and many other places.

As per the title, the field of candidates was very competitive. Sure, there were the typical pile of generic 'blanket' applications that didn't come close, but about 100 of the applicants were in the mix. Within that group were about 40 that were really promising.  

We ended up interviewing 10 candidates, which meant I left about 30 or so applicants on the table that I would have had no problem interviewing or hiring. That meant we had to send our standard 'thanks, but no thanks' letter to 30 people who in an ordinary round of applications would have been selected for interview in a heartbeat.

I'm not writing this to remind anyone how depressing the job market is. I'm writing this to remind people not to be discouraged by these letters. If you put in a decent application, the rejection letter means someone was better on paper. It doesn't mean you were not close. Sometimes you were very close.

My advice is to keep interning, volunteering, sweeping floors, networking and doing whatever you can until you make up that distance.

The following is a list of things we, the young, graduated, and unemployed wish you knew.

We are not lazy.  We have done what all the articles say, and we have treated looking for a job like a job.  We have applied for more than 100 positions at this time.  We have had interviews, phone interviews, follow ups, you name it. None of them have panned out.  

Please do not look at the gap of employment in my résumé as a reason not to hire us.  If anything, it is a reason to hire us.  We appreciate the value of a job, and certainly more than we did after we’d been searching for a month.  We are not just working hard to find a job, but are willing to work just as diligently to keep a job.  We are the people that will go above and beyond and will never give up.  Otherwise we would have by now.

Offering only entry level positions that are internships and not extending internships to non-students hurts.  We will prove our willingness to work while working for free.  But you have to let us.  75% of positions we come across that are not internships or part-time expect 3-5 years of experience.  To bring you that, we need your help, and we are willing to be molded.

For those businesses that take the time to reply to applications, thank you.  We’ve spent hours writing, rewriting and redesigning our résumés and cover letters, and not to mention we have likely spent significant time filling out your online application.  There are businesses that take the time to respond to every applicant. You can too.  At least let us know the position is closed so we can move on to the next thing.  It endears us to your company even more, and even if you don’t hire us, you may get our business in the future. 

As always, we thank you for your time and consideration,

I try not to get involved too much in HR, but from time to time there are jobs that we post for that I do need to review and be in on the interviews. As a loving Redditor I would like to give out some points that many job seekers, especially young ones fail to capture.

* We have no idea how many jobs you have applied/interviewed for. Take every application and interview serious.

* Sending out bulk resumes to various companies is worthless. If you are going to send your resume to 10 companies posting in a specific field you still need to customize every one depending on the job requirements. We can tell who is just sending out resume's and who is taking the time to make sure they their resume has addressed all of OUR job criteria along with a custom cover letter pertaining to details in our posting.

* Take the time to make your resume look good, is it easy to read and write a little bit about what you did at all your previous jobs. Now this is important, DO NOT SEND WORD or TXT files. Make a PDF and give it a real name not Resume.DOCX, try Bob_Smith_Resume.PDF. PDF's are cleaner, faster, easier and it show another small level of giving a crap.

* Add your other talents to your resume, I am ok with them being hobbies. It helps you stand out when I can remember the one with the guy who can juggle chainsaws or plays competitive poker. I would stop short of showing off how much Reddit Karma you have collected, but when we are reviewing hundreds of resume's anything small to make you stand out over everyone who has listed WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT, QUICKBOOKS as their skills. 

* Job Hoppers - We are very wary of you. If you show as many jobs as you have been in the workforce we are not interested in spending the time to train you just for you to always be looking for something better. If you were working multiple jobs at the same time or were doing contract work, make that VERY clear. If you have 8 different jobs over 9 years consider taking off some that were only a couple months long. Or if there were just seasonal work make that VERY clear.

* Low experience applicants, yeah it is going to be a little tough to stand out in the crowd and that is all the more reason to make what little experience you have had look great. Also really take the time to add in all those other talents and random skills you may have.

* If we actually give you an interview spend a couple minutes researching our company, it will pay off. Also write down a list of questions you may have about our organization as during the interview you may bet fluster and forget. 

* Dress up regardless of the position being applied for


There are tons of other suggestions that I can offer and I would be happy to answer questions you may have, but really know that in some cases we as the job posters are just as frustrated trying to find good employees. A position that we have been advertising for the past 2 weeks has yielded 120 applications, we offered 15 of them interviews, 5 actually showed up for their interview and only 2 showed interest and enthusiasm for getting the position.

I'm sure a few of you use this and/or have heard of it, but I thought it was brilliant.  

Basically, it emails you when a new keyword on Craigslist pops up for a specific category.  I live in NYC where there are hundreds of jobs posted a day, so when something I'm interested in specifically comes up, I get an email and then BAM I'm on it (opposed to searching the same 5 keywords over and over each day).  

Example - I work in administration but would like to get into holistic healthcare.  So when the word 'holistic' or 'alternative medicine' pops up in Admin Jobs in NYC, I get an email.  4/5 times its a good match for my skills. 

Could be useful if you were looking for anything else on Craigslist, but I've been on top of getting a resume to really sweet looking jobs thanks to this.

I'm actually writing this post on behalf of my friend. She's worked at a small company for the past year, under 2 of the founding partners. Neither are very nice, and though they also don't pay well, have kept her employed with the promise that they would be more profitable soon.

However, in the past 2 months working conditions have taken a turn for the worst. It's clear that the business is not making enough money to support it's overhead, which involved long days, and no additional pay. Within the last month however, both of these partners have becoming outwardly hostile towards my friend, writing derogatory emails, calling her a bitch, telling her how ""dumb"" she is. As my friend has access to the company income and spending statements, she can see that they are very short on funds. It is assumed that these mean techniques are to make working so unpleasant, that she will quit, and they will not have to pay unemployment. She has not, however, quit.

So, today, the 2 partners approached my friend and told her that she is required to put in her 2 weeks notice to leave. Not having another job, and nothing lined up, she refused. They told her that she can either put in her 2 weeks notice, or be fired on the spot (today). Again refusing, my friend told them if they fire her, she would collect unemployment, to which they responded that she is 2 days short of collecting unemployment.

So, as this is extremely frustrating and unjust, I am wondering if there is any LEGAL action that could be taken here. I'm willing to talk to the bureau of labor, the better business bureau, or anyone else that can help with this. Is there anything that can be done?

**TLDR: Friend is forced to put in 2 weeks notice to quit her job. Company refuses to pay unemployment. Is this illegal?**

Edit: Partners just sent her an email with a note along the lines of ""thank you for informing us of your intent to leave the company. We wish you all the best."" - Clearly trying to make it appear on record that she had given some verbal notice of her leaving. Again, not something she did or wants to do.

Edit #2: Just spoke with my friend on the phone. She is forwarding all derogatory emails to a third party email account, as well as to mine. She is also taking screenshots of all text messages (that were apparently also derogatory). She's also replying to the email with something along the lines of ""I apologize for any misunderstandings that may have occurred outside of my knowledge but I do not have, nor have I ever had, any intention of resigning.""",,False,,t5_2qhnd,1371512021.0,,,True,t3_1gjmeg,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gjmeg/is_this_illegal_company_is_firing_my_friend_by/,

Basically, I called out two managers in defense for basically doing incompetent work after they both tried to scapegoat me for their own mistakes.  The problem is, they're 2 out of the 4 middle managers in my group and I have to have a working relationship with them.  

Their response was to put together a lengthy, vague, and poorly documented complaint that I promptly shredded word for word, with supporting emails, in my response.  

The problem now is that I need to have my work ""assessed"" and they're responsible for a large part of the assessment. The problem is that in this assessment, they've basically been giving me  assignments with intentionally missing, contradictory, and misleading instructions.  When I send it to them, they throw up their hands and say, ""Well, you should have asked me.  It's your fault this is wrong.""  Then, when I've asked them to clarify their expectations, they've gone to their superiors and told them that I was being confrontational, asking questions about things I should know from experience, wasting their time, (blatant lie, but too much detail for upper management to investigate) and questioning their intelligence by asking stupid questions. I don't know what to do at this point. How do I deal with this before getting fired?

tl;dr:  Managers are intentionally giving me bad instructions to get me fired, then telling their managers I'm asking wasting time if I try to ask questions to figure out what the hell they actually want done

I have always seen the ""Make money from home"" positions, and have blown right by.  But unfortunately scammers have gotten a little more elaborate.

I applied on craigslist to be a ""Direct to Consumer Graphic Designer"" for an international chocolate brand's US office.  I noticed 2 weird things off the bat, but everything else (description, requirements) seemed fine.  The two things I saw were 1.) they misspelled the german name of the company in the middle of the description and 2.) Compensation said ""starting at 12.""

I dismissed the misspelling because everyone makes mistakes, and I ignored the compensation because there was no way this position was starting at $12 an hour so I figured it was some copy/ paste error.  I sent over my resume and cover letter.

The next day I received an email a human resource manager of a recruiting firm named Ruth G (no last name given beyond ""G"") asking for me to fill out an application online for further my candidacy. They gave me a pin # for hirescreen.org.  The email header said:  ATTN: Jack XXXX, Re: Applying for XXXXX &amp;amp; XXXXX's Direct to Consumer Graphic Designer position. The ATTN and rejected html should have been heads up.  There was also a spacing error in the email like t his. 

Anyway,  the giddiness of getting an email back spurred me to start filling out their online application.  I get to the last page and they asked me to go to creditreport.com and get my credit score to verify my identity. Thats when I called XXXXX  chocolate's office and they said they do not use craigslist at all or recruiters.  

Today I received another recruiters email with the same header.  This time it went from offering me a job to just degrading to a prepaid visa scam link.

The short version is simply to look out for weirdness especially on craigslist.

1359607168.0,88,self.jobs,17m0jp,"After over 500 applications and over a year of looking, I finally got a job! Here is what I changed and it worked for me.",105,17,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17m0jp/after_over_500_applications_and_over_a_year_of/,"I just wanted to let you guys know out there looking for a job to not give up. One of the biggest things I learned over the past year and half is to be patient and make sure you PRACTICE! In the last 2 months I have gotten more interviews than I did prior to changing my thinking. And this is how:

1. Act like you got the job - I went into every interview in the last two months thinking I got the job. It boosted my confidence and I did a lot better than I thought I did. Prior to this I went in thinking I am not qualified or that there is someone better than me. That just stressed me out more and effected my interview negatively. 

2. Go in there thinking you don't need the job - I went into the interview doing this but at the same time thinking I got the job if I wanted and wow...things changed. I got 4 offers within 2 weeks as soon as I started doing this. I am starting a graduate program so I went into the interview thinking ""whatever, if I don't get it then I have my masters program."" Find whatever your ""graduate program"" is and use that to help boost your confidence and reduce your stress.

3. Know your resume in and out. Make sure it has no mistakes. Make sure you know every detail on it. And make sure you practice the question ""Walk me through your resume.""

4. Make sure you know the answers and practice them to those typical questions listed everywhere online. One of the big ones is ""Tell me about yourself"" or ""What is your greatest strength and weakness?""

5. Make sure you tweak your cover letter to the specific job. I used to just use a generic Cover letter and just change the company name and position. I changed it to include keywords from the posting. I started getting a lot more responses for my apps!

Just remember to stay positive, be patient, and use every interview as a learning experience to do better on the next one.

EDIT
I have a little bit more time to write out some more tips so here they are.

1. Experience is very important. For months I didn't get anything except part-time interviews. At first, I discarded those opportunities but then I needed money. I took these jobs on doing part-time work that related to my field. When it came time for interviews/applications, I had something to talk about. I was able to show that I have experience and that I am willing to put in the work (I was working 3 part time jobs at once). This also gives you opportunities to network. I was able to get 2 referrals through my part time positions.

2. GPA. My GPA was low (2.5ish). I messed up my freshman and sophomore year but then I got my act together and tried to bring up my GPA as much as I could. I kept thinking this is what kept stopping me from getting any calls for my apps but it wasn't. I never put my GPA on my resume unless they asked me. There were a few companies that rejected me because of it but majority didn't even ask for my GPA. I had many that asked about my GPA and why it was low. I explained to them the real reason and they very somewhat understanding of it. So don't let your GPA bring you down.

In relation to number 4 above. Look up common interview questions for the company. You can go to Glassdoor.com and type in the company name. It will give you salaries ranges, company information, jobs, employee reviews, and INTERVIEW REVIEWS. These interview reviews list questions the candidates were asked, the process, the position, and other information. This site helped me a lot! I prepared answers to the questions on the site and 6/10 times those questions would be asked. Make sure you have solid examples for questions. When asked a question I would always think of PSR. Problem - Solution - Result. I would state the problem, the solution I came up with, and the result of my solution. This is short but informative at the same time. Plus it shows your problem solving skills. ",,False,,t5_2qhnd,1359676421.0,,,True,t3_17m0jp,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17m0jp/after_over_500_applications_and_over_a_year_of/,

So, for years before college, and all through college, everyone in the science and engineering industries were freaking out “There aren’t enough people going into science/engineering!” – “America needs more engineers, we won’t have enough” – “No one is going into Science/engineering. Will America fall behind technologically!?!?!1!!1?1!one”.  

Well. Guess what? I loved math, I loved science so I got my degree in Structural Engineering. I worked my ass off, studied, got an internship working 30+ hours a week. 18-22 credits a semester, I gave up so many things. And I did it! I graduated with my degree in Structural Engineering! I took the F.E. and passed! I was ready! … but guess what?   

That’s right. No jobs. Where did they go? No one could tell me. Were they coming back? “I don’t know” was the response. Well, wait, I was told for 8+ years these jobs were needed, in fact, it was a matter of national-fucking-security that I be some sort of scientist or engineer. And here I am, and there’s nothing! I have to work part time at fucking McDonalds and even then, I can’t afford my school loans. You tell me it’s because there’s just not enough money, no one is building, no one is investing. I call Bull Shit. I think people are hoarding money, and genuinely just don’t give two fucks about our economy or it’s direction.  

Now, I understand the economy sucks. But here’s the deal. It will come back, and when it does, you know what will happen? Your company is up shit creek with no paddle. Why? Because instead of INVESTING in younger engineers and training them, you sat on your stacks and whined that you were no longer making 40billion a year, only 10 billion. And that just wasn’t enough for the Jet AND the M3.   

So guess what. Fuck you. Fuck all of you and your stupid companies. I hope in the end, America becomes an intellectually and technologically bankrupt society for lack of caring and investing in those willing to sacrifice their time and money, for those that were willing to invest themselves into a part of society that clearly no one gives a fuck about.   

Have fun explaining to your grandchildren why there are no serviceable bridges left the country, and why there are no roads in the year 2030. **I’m out bitches!**  

**TL:DR** - Fuck every single last one of you.

I am 6 weeks away from graduating from a law degree. I went to one of the *least* prestigious law schools in my area. I am not in the top of my class nor am I going to graduate with any extra commendations. However I am currently employed as a judicial assistant/clerk.

I didn't get this job by being the best in my class, I didn't get it because I was the most intelligent or the most creative. The sole and only reason I got the job is because during my law degree I made some good connections. Don't get me wrong I did some pretty crappy jobs, I volunteered a LOT, I worked LONG hours for little money and I spent a lot of my 'free time' trying to catch up on school work but I did it all knowing it would pay off eventually. 

So, my advice to you is to start getting experience ASAP. Even if you have to go to the court and volunteer for six months (I did!) even if you go weeks, months without a day off (did that too) just start getting experience and most importantly NETWORKING with the higher ups in your field. It will mean that when there is an entry level job that required 2 years experience, not only will you most likely have the experience, but you'll also probably know the HR guy, and your future boss, and some of your future colleagues.

Top of my class, commencement speaker, Phi Beta Kappa and all that. No job offers. I stayed in my school town all summer, working for the school and looking for jobs. Got a few interviews but no offers. 

After holding on as long as I could, I moved home, to a small town that is really big in the summer for tourists, and kinda big in the winter for Snow Birds. I was convinced that I wasn't going to be able to find anything in this small town. My parents moved there while I was in school, so I have no friends and no connections. My father wanted me to join him on his truck, and become a truck driver. It makes a lot of money but it was down there with sewage treatment as far as what I wanted to do.

Last Sunday he called me and woke me up, offering me a bunch of incentives to come work on the truck with him, including an Ipad (which is funny, because I'm the farthest thing from an Applefan girl ever, and have never expressed a desire for one). As I was about to resign myself to working for him for the next year, just so I could make a dent in my Loans, two companies called me, offering me interviews. 

One was part time, it was offered to me and I accepted, but they are waiting on my drug test. The second is a full time assistant manager. I've been hoping and praying all weekend that the second job would call and hire me before my drug results got back to the first job... 

THEY DID. I start work tomorrow at the full time job. I will most likely have to ""Quit"" the barista job- I haven't started working for them, so it shouldn't be a big deal. After I call them, I will send a thank you note for the interview and the offer. 

TL;DR - Two jobs got offered to me in my home town, in one of the worst states for unemployment. Today is my birthday and the call for me to start tomorrow for the full time job just came.

I've spent 6 years in the Air Force, after 4 years of working in retail sales/guest relations. I'm being honorably discharged with a squeaky clean criminal background. I've been making a VERY good salary of $48,000/yr and due to the sequestration and what seems like a dim future for the DoD, I'm not going to reenlist. 

I have an Associate's Degree and 75 credits towards my Bachelor's in Business Marketing. I applied to and landed a job at a presitigious PGA Tour golf resort, where the HR director constantly repeated that I am ""a viable asset to the company"" and they will ""do everything they can to keep me"". This gave me confidence that I would receive at least a manageable wage, though I anticipated a slight cut.

After two incredible interviews and four days of patiently waiting, I received a call for an official job offer and they were **gladly** offering me an hourly rate of....$9.40. I didn't know how to respond. except through a *polite* ""you know that's a $30,000/yr pay cut for me, right?"" She didn't seem phased and continued on with what I could do to move up in the company in the future. We discussed what my **minimum** livable wage would be, and I insisted that after I budget, I could scrape by on $15-16/hr. This was apparently way too much to ask, and she politely declined, saying that kind of rate was for someone who has been with the company for 10+ years. She still wants me for the job, and is calling back today for a follow up. 

I'm not one who feels like I'm entitled to anything by any means, I've worked from the bottom up in every company I've been employed by since I was 14. But I honestly feel insulted and degraded by her offering a high school wage for a veteran. What is the best way to politely tell her that I cannot take the job because of the incredibly low offer, while still getting the point across that her asking price was incredibly disrespectful?

Downvote all you want if you feel that I am acting incredibly stuck up. But I feel I am 100% in the right. Thank you in advance.

AMAA.,93,16,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nsrfy/how_i_tripled_my_response_rate_to_applications/,"Hey r/jobs! Thought I'd share my success with you in hopes that what I did can maybe help someone else land a job.

**My Story:** 

I finished my master's degree (in writing) in August of 2010 and have been looking for a ""real"" job since. I was underemployed (working two part time jobs and barely making ends meet) and getting very little response to applications all of last fall/spring. I actually got a job I was really excited about in Nov of 2010 (through a friend) but had it taken away at the last minute for circumstances out of my control. It sucked. This past summer, I had an opportunity to go out of the country for 2 months. When I got back, I moved in with my parents and revamped my search. The small tweaks I made significantly changed the response rate I was getting, and I just accepted a position that I'm super excited about with a decent salary and great benefits. It can be done, even in this economy!

**The Numbers:**

I made a [perty graph](http://imgur.com/a/5WwLE#0) detailing the difference between my two periods of job searching. In the first period I applied for 28 jobs and only got 3 responses: two telephone interviews and one in person interview/hire (through a personal contact, the job mentioned above that fell through.) In the second period I applied for 35 jobs and got 10 responses, 5 of which I would qualify myself as a ""finalist"" for. [Here's a more detailed break down](http://imgur.com/a/5WwLE#1).

**My Methods:**

I want to start by saying all of the jobs I applied for with the exception of two (one in the first period and one in the second) were positions that I found through online search engines. Both jobs that I was personally recommended for I got responses to, so if you have contacts, work them! But if you don't, it's not the end of the world. 

I relied primarily on craigslist and idealist.com, and to a lesser extent indeed.com and higheredjobs.com. Because I have a pretty diverse skill set (so was applying to jobs in three very different markets: education, writing, and communication/web marketing) I did not put my resume online for employers to find me; I didn't want to limit myself and I wanted to control what of my background employers saw.

I would search for jobs 2 or 3 times a week, but not more or I would start to stress myself out. In between the searches, I applied for the positions. I had 3 basic resume templates going, which I would further modify to fit the specifics of each individual job. Same with cover letters: I would reuse parts, but each letter was individually crafted to fit the specifics of each job description.  I spent a minimum of an hour on each application, usually more like 2-3. If the job did not have a specified date of first review, I tried to get my application in within three days of when it was posted, a week on the outside edge. If it had been more than a week and I hadn't applied, I took the job off of my list; my time was better spent looking for more recent postings. 

**The Changes I Made:**

1. My resume. The biggest difference in the response rate is, I believe, due to my resume. First, I revamped the look so it was more modern, and added just a hint of color so it popped. I wanted it to stand out; people judge you not only by what's on your resume, but how professional it looks. I googled creative and unique resumes and used them as inspiration for my own. Second, I changed my job titles. I've primarily worked for very small companies, with sort of vague job titles. I basically made them sound more important without lying. If an prospective employer contacted one of these old jobs, my ex-bosses wouldn't care that I'd called myself an ""writing specialist"" instead of a ""tutor."" This won't work for everyone because some companies are very grouchy about such things. Here is a version of my [old resume](http://imgur.com/a/5WwLE#3) and one of my [new resume](http://imgur.com/a/5WwLE#2), with very similar content. You'll note that I have a 2 page resume, which some people rail against.  I did not find it to be a detriment, but I also made absolutely sure that my most important qualifications were all on page 1 (work history and education.)

2. The types of jobs I was applying for.  When I finished my master's program, what I really wanted to do was teach freshman writing/comp at a university or community college. I soon found out that these jobs are VERY competitive right now, especially in the areas I was looking (California.) There are so many professors currently out of work that I was competing against people with published books and 10-15 years of experience for entry level positions; I didn't stand a chance! I broadened my search to include other educational positions, non-profits, and some communications positions and I had no problem finding interesting sounding opportunities in these areas. Think slightly outside your box of knowledge and you'll have way more things to apply for - this also gives you an angle to take into interviews. In the job I just accepted, I sort of branded myself as an outsider candidate; I knew that I didn't have the ""traditional"" background, but showed how my unusual experiences would bring new ideas to the organization.

3. Local address. During my first period of applications, I was living in LA and looking for positions in the Bay Area. Without thinking about it, I put my LA address on the top of my resumes/cover letters because, well, that's where I lived! I could have easily gotten in my car and driven the 6 hours for an interview, but I don't think that employers knew that. They're getting hundreds of resumes for each position, and just looking for any reason to throw yours into the no pile. In my second period of applications, I asked my cousin (who lives in San Francisco) if I could use her address, and she agreed. Of course, this caused some issues when it came to interviewing (as I was living in Colorado at the time) but I always managed to figure it out. If people brought it up, I admitted it was my cousin's address and said I was splitting my time between there and CO. I used the hell out of my frequent flier miles going back and forth for interviews. I did include my CO address on applications where I knew it wouldn't matter (usually for larger companies who are looking for the best employee regardless of geographical location, and with the resources to fly you out to interview in person.  The job I ended up getting I used my CO address on.)

**tl;dr:** making my resume pretty, looking for positions slightly outside my expertise, and strategically using a local address helped me triple my response rate to applications and ultimately land an awesome job.

* Applications require home address (may include past), personal cell number (or multiple contact info), SSN, and they haven't reached the background checks yet. For most employers who talks of treating job hunting like going on dates, these are information that you wouldn't nonchalantly hand out to the stranger across the dinner table. 

* They go on to ask about job histories. Some, which you are SUPPOSED to hide despite your accomplishments and how it has shaped you to be the employee that you are. The rest are judged vehemently based on partial information. Even then, you are supposed to reduce them down to a bunch of buzz words (not the meaningless, inflated ones) and numbers. To truly showcase your career biography, is job-hunting suicide.

* Between all the blogs and the books of ""experts"" yelling at the applicants, there is no room for individual variance. Dress a certain way, answer it like that, make sure to not write that in there...Any hint of the individual being him/herself is considered toxic and unwelcome. 

* This would be even worse than the applicants who TRULY aimed for a particular organization to work with. It's been your top choice and maybe you've built your whole academic careers around this organization and its subject areas. Or it caught your eyes just as you're about ready to charge out there and make a difference. Or you were willing to move across the country for that opportunity! In the end, you're supposed to just deal with the fact that it's perfectly acceptable if they treat you like another number and toss you out haphazardly.

* You lead your own life. Sometimes things don't work out the way they do. It happens but you've learned to deal with it as a growing human being. You bounce back and still get the job done. The employer, however, is not interested on any level. A simple typo, a late appointment, a slip of the tongue about your private life, and you're done for. In their narrow viewing glass, any event caused by something out of your control is obviously an egregious violation to the moral and ethics that is being the perfect worker. You are deemed less from then on. 

To the organization, with the occasional employer that whines about having *too many* applications to go through, they certainly have their reasons. ""Don't take it personally"", from their perspective, means that shit happens because of numbers, deal with it. But to the applicants, who opened up so much about themselves and put their livelihoods on the line, it's not about being singled out and purposely denied a job - the phrase means being treated like less than a human being.

Like a lot of you guys, I went through my own job search hell. Saying the job market is rough is an understatement. That being said, I finally landed a great high-paying job at a good company after six months of rejection.

I have a ton of great experience. I've worked in a variety of positions, some of them very high-pressure and high-visibility. Unfortunately I had a few things working against me:

* 1) My job experience was all over the place. I worked in a bunch of different fields. Even though I'm good at what I do, my resume screamed ""Jack of all trades but master at none.""

* 2) I had a huge gap in resume after my last job 15 months ago.

* 3) Due to a lot of early success, I was coming across as overqualified for a lot of positions.

* 4) I was fired from two jobs and had issues when companies demanded references from those specific companies.

I applied to well over a hundred positions, had 20~ first round interviews, 15~ second interviews... I even had 3rd &amp; 4th round interviews that fell apart due to problems with the reference checks.

**All that changed when I decided the honest approach wasn't working. I decided to fudge things on my resume.**

What I did was pretty simple... 

* 1) I made up a fake position (at a real company) to fill the gap on my resume. I was very careful to say it was a contract position so it could not be verified by W2s or through HR.

* 2) I matched what I did at that job to whatever job I was applying to exactly. Example: If it was a sales position, I had the best damn sales experience you'd ever find. I was careful not to exaggerate to the point of impossible, but I made it sound impressive for sure. I also made sure to only apply for positions I am knowledgeable and experienced in. I wouldn't want to fake my way into something totally over my head, after all!

* 3) I asked a close friend to act as the reference for me. In this case, he owns his own business so he let me use his business on my resume. But if you don't know anyone who would let you do that, a totally fake reference at a real company is a viable second option.

After I blasted that resume out I had 10 interviews the following week. Within a month I had 4 offers to pick from. I even passed background and reference checks.

I just started with the company and they're delighted to have me. My whole job search turned around when I decided the honest approach wasn't worth it anymore.

In that job, I was making $36,000/year. Even before that, I was sending out resume's because I knew my job security was shaky. I got a call back from a very large company in my field. They were going to pay $65,000/year for the same thing I was doing at my first company. I was one of only 3 people interviewing (or so I was told). 

The company is located in a big city so I asked about parking. They told me I could park on-site. I looked it up, it was about a 45 minute drive, but I left an hour and a half early in case of traffic, etc. When I get there, the address they gave me was technically correct, but the parking is on the other side of the building, which is a different street. Everything is one way in this city, so I had to drive around in a huge circle to get to the parking area. 

When I get to the parking area, there was a gate with a card reading machine that said ""swipe your badge"". I obviously did not have a badge, but there was a speaker phone for security. I pushed the button and got someone. He said ""employees only."" I told him I had an interview and he just repeated ""EMPLOYEES. ONLY."" So then I had to back out onto a busy street and look for parking. 

I finally found a place to park after 20 minutes of looking, and it cost me $10. I had to walk roughly 10 minutes back to the building and by this time I was 5 minutes late. I get to the security desk and  I told the security officer (a different one than the one I talked to on the speaker) and told her I had an interview with Mark. She told me there was nobody here by that name. I showed her the e-mail, and she just repeated, again more sternly ""Sir, I just told you there is nobody here by that name."" Just then a guy walks through the door. He says ""Oh! You must be CIthrowAway. Im Mark, I have been waiting for you!"" I look back to the security officer and she just sighs heavily and gave me the ""whatever"" hand gesture. 

Then Mark interviewed me and asked me questions about my experience. He cut me off every time after about 1 sentence and asked me another question. At the end he just said ""we'll call you if you match our needs"" and left. 

I was basically like WTF. I felt crazy because I had no idea what just happened. This is a legit company so it isnt like they dont have it together.

I received a pretty generous job offer after being unemployed for many months and after seeking the advice of family and friends was tempted to just accept the offer as is. 

Personally, I HATE negotiating. Although it has served me well in the past it makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it. My awesome husband kept urging me to counteroffer so after accepting that the company won't renege on their end just because I asked for more money I wrote up a counteroffer and they accepted! I will now be making an additional $3,000 per year at a company I am very excited to work for.

I'm sure some may say I should have asked for more since they accepted so easily, but I am still super excited and will be more confident the next time I need to negotiate a salary.

1358550827.0,71,self.jobs,16ug8c,"Frustrated and desperate, I decided to conduct a little experiment. I'm not proud of what I did but I thought I'd share the results. (Also, AMA)",92,21,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16ug8c/frustrated_and_desperate_i_decided_to_conduct_a/,"After firing hundreds of resumes into the void with no response, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to do something that I'm in no way proud of and is totally deserving of the hate I'll get from this subreddit: I posted a fake job ad for an entry-level office admin position just to see what I'm up against. After mashing together a generic job description for the position and creating a fake email address for a recruiting company (using gmail), I posted the ad to the Craigslist hiring section for my city (large metro area, Pop. 2+ million). 

My intent was in no way malicious - the ad was pulled after about 6 hours and I deleted each resume after reading it, and I certainly do feel guilty about it. However, it was *very* educational and I thought I'd share the results.

Now, there is some element of selection bias to using Craigslist, but it was the only way that I could post an ad with the minimal amount of verification. I'm sure I would have gotten much different results if I had posted it to the more professional job boards, but I'm sure their verification process is much more efficient than CL's.
_____________________________________________________________

In the 6 hours the ad was posted, 24 applications were received. The ad was posted on a Wednesday afternoon. Each resume was glanced over for about 30s and then binned. Here are the results:

In the ad, I specified that applicants were to attach a resume but purposefully didn't ask for a cover letter:
 
- Only 2 provided one with their resume, in addition to introducing themselves in their email
- 60% just put a 2-3 paragraph introductory blurb about themselves in the text of the email, 
- 25% just wrote a paragraph or less (e.g. intro + contact info)
- The rest only put something along the lines of ""Hello"" (literally just that) ""My resume is attached. [First Name]"" or ""Re: [Position Title]""
_____________________________________________________________

General Observations:

* I purposefully specified that resumes had to be submitted as a Word .doc, which all of them were. **~70%** of the resumes lost their formatting when viewed in Google docs. 

* Despite advertising the job as ""entry-level"" (min. 1 year of experience) and listing a salary just above minimum wage, about 20% of the resumes I received were from people with 10+ years of experience, 2 with 20+. They were also by far the best in terms of quality of writing and presentation.

* The better resumes (IMO) were the ones that only listed 2-3 positions with detailed job descriptions, as opposed to the ones that gave every job they've held in the last six years. I really didn't need to know you worked at Wendy's for a summer during your undergrad.

* Formatting: the best resumes were the ones that seemed like they had the most white space on them. Good use of space + simple descriptions were the winning combo. 

* Although I shouldn't have to scroll to the second page past your education, objective, skills and list of qualifications just to see your experience. Nor should each job description take up 2/3rds of a page (it was a five-page resume)

* Quite a few people applying with indirectly relevant experience and then not putting any effort whatsoever to justify it in their cover letter/blurbs

EDIT: Here's a big one -&gt; since I was using Gmail, people who emailed me *from* a Gmail account had their Google+ accounts show up next to their name. I didn't click through to any of them, but an actual recruiter might be tempted to if they're using gmail themselves. I know nobody actually uses Google+, but keep that in mind.
____________________________________________________________

Greatest sins: 

- Non-Title Sentences That Were Written Like This.
- Inconsistent dates (i.e. Nov-Dec 2012: XX, 12/12-Present: YY)
- A really stellar resume that was titled ""[Applicant Name] - Oct. 2011""
- Or resumes with titles that screamed generic resume like ""[Applicant Name] - Administrative Resume"" or ""office resume"" or ""Resume - AA""
- Positions listed with no actual description of what they did in this position, especially if the positions before/after it did. (Although some did do this for their non-related experience -putting it in a separate section of the resume - I don't see recruiters having a problem with that.)
- Terrible or inconsistent formatting
- Inconsistent bolding of words/titles - i.e. **Position A, City A** - **Position B,** City B.
- Repetitive job descriptions - i.e. it was obvious they had copy + pasted the same description for different positions with similar duties

OK, this got a lot wordier than I had planned. If I remember anything I left out, I'll add it to the list. Go ahead and AM(A)A about it.

**Major EDIT:** u/AllenPinkerton submited an NPR article about someone who did the exact same thing, on a wider scale.

* If you do apply online, cold calls to that company's HR work (This is how I got my interview that got me the job). Call asking to talk to the HR department and mention that you have applied for the position and ask if there's anything else you should know.  
* Know as much about the company as possible. What they do, their products and brands, their upcoming projects and what you like the most about what they do.  
* Send thank you emails to all the people you interview with. I was told my the person who hired me that it is a courtesy he rarely sees.

My wife even says that further down the road we could integrate connections where you can offer to mentor a certain number of similar people to yourself and help them enter into jobs at your company or others that may be of the same industry.


There is just too much BS out there and people are getting sick of it. I want to make a job site by the people and for the people.


Is there a site like this? In addition, if I just small budget it and build it in wordpress or phpbb will people come? How should I lay it out?
I really want to help people because I do not like the suffering going on right now.

1323473242.0,73,self.jobs,n6u6q,22 hour work day yesterday and I got fired for not calling-in today,89,16,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/n6u6q/22_hour_work_day_yesterday_and_i_got_fired_for/,"I was not a good fit for this place.  I had previous jobs and didn't come from fast food like everyone else there so I wouldn't just do whatever I was told.  They refused to buy the software needed for our data analysis so they insisted that we go through **hundreds of thousands of lines** of data by hand and I expressed how ludicrous that was.

Anyways, the straw the broke the camels back happened this morning.  I left for NYC yesterday morning at 3AM.  At the last minute they dumped additional work on me that I told them I would not be able to complete, especially if there were problems.  Everything went smooth til I started to follow our new procedures, then shit got fucked up.  But, I got through it.  I called my manager to let me know that I was not to be able to get to additional work that they wanted me to because I ran into problems.  I explained in full detail what happened, what went wrong, how I fixed it, etc.  Then he went into a rant about how it was important, do some of it, get a later flight and that's when I cut him off, it was obvious he didn't give a shit and I said I would figure it out.

So I change my flight from 6:30 to 9:00 (Delayed til 10), I arrive at the second location and begin my work. My coworker calls and says he needs some of the equipment I have first thing in the morning, I say I just got started, I have late flight and I can't do that as I don't have a building key.  Come to find out this was just a ploy to get me to drop the equipment off and get it out of my possession.  I get everything done, get to the airport and get on my flight.  

This manager is the definition of a micro-manager.  He once demanded that I give him a summary about how everyone acted in a sales meeting with a vendor ""Who was the most verbal, inquisitive and who contributed the most?""  WTF?  I told him that I did not feel comfortable answering that and I don't appreciate being put in that situation. So since he was always going behind everyone's backs asking about everyone, I knew damn well that he knew I changed my flight and that I texted my co-worker at 1:30 AM this morning.

He calls me at 9:45 and I'm just getting up, still feel like garbage.  Asks where I am, so you did end up changing your flight  (Where he later admits that my co-worker does indeed tell him that I am on a later flight) and you need to come in still.  I ask him if he was joking and I said that's simply not going to happen.  He says he feels more comfortable with the expensive equipment being at the office rather than at someones house.  It being here all last weekend should have been a huge hint to me that something was up.  He's taking a half day and that I need to bring it in by noon.

I arrive at the office and he tells me that because I didn't call-in this morning and inform of my late flight (That he knew about all along) that I'm not a good fit and there needs to be constant communication.  Yeah, ok, I dropped the ball on letting you know, but I was more focused on getting the task at hand done and just how the fuck I was going to get back home that night.  And since I didn't call, that I am no longer employed there.  23 hours, two cities, completed tasks at hand (and more) and you're firing me because I didn't call you?  ""Well if you would have called me, I would have realized that you worked 23 hours and you could have come in at 10 today""  Just because you pay me salary and get out of paying overtime, doesn't mean you can work us however long/much you want.

Anyways, they were an odd group.  I had to submit 2 news articles per week (Tracked in a spreadsheet) and write commentary about them to the entire 9 person company.  We would get special tips and training videos on the one piece of software they actually bought and we had to write up summaries and discuss them over lunch, not a company lunch-meeting, they would require us to go to lunch and everyone pay separately even me who always brought my lunch.  And we had to do these videos and news articles while were doing that data analysis and flying around the country collecting more data.

Now I just need to worry about health insurance for my kids and wife.  She has a pre-existing condition which rules out individual policies and they were too small of a company for COBRA.  When I lost my last job I could at least COBRA.

So, I basically found my dream job. I couldn't have been happier. The job was at a company that had a significant voice in the entire industry as a whole. I'm being vague here on purpose. I was working for the top guys in my industry. 

Few months later.. I got fired. I deal with depression and anxiety a lot and had to commute very long hours which would often cause me to be late (despite the company's flex time policy). Miscommunication played a large roll in it as well. The largest reason I was given for being let go was that my work just wasn't good enough and I didnt put enough hours into it. That shook me personally. I left somewhat peacefully, thanking them for my time and then just walked right out the door, stone faced. I haven't spoken to any of them since. 

This has really fucked with my head.  I had tried to apply to other related companies but working at a company that is so well known in their industry makes it incredibly difficult. Word gets around and I'm somewhat forced into changing careers. 

I've pretty much given up. If anyone has any similar experience or ideas, I'd really love to head them. 

I really just imagine interviewing, ""oh you worked at X?! How was it there? Why did you leave?"" .... ""Oh well I was fired because they felt my work just wasn't up to par"" I know it'll get brought up in an interview and I dont want to tell the whole story, but the short version is just ""I sucked...""

I wanted to give people a heads up about an email I got recently from millsandjohnson.com that I think might be praying on desperate job seekers. Here was my experience:

I checked my inbox to find an email alerting me that my application for the position of ""Data Clerk"" had been reviewed by a recruiting firm, Mills &amp; Johnson, and that they wanted me to fill out a pre-interview questionnaire before scheduling an interview. I didn't remember applying for that position, but I've sent out a lot of applications, the job title fit with what I was applying for in general, and the email even said the job was in the correct city, so I figured, ""What the hell? Can't hurt"". 

The questionnaire was pretty standard, no sensitive information - name, phone, email, no SSN or credit card or such - and the questions all seemed like standard interview fare (""Describe your ideal workplace"", ""List five adjectives that describe you""). Then it got fishy. On the last page, I was asked to follow a link to an external site to complete my credit check. I would a ""customer reference number"", which I should then enter on their site to finalize my application. When I clicked on the link, I was taken to creditreport.com, the evil reincarnated zombie corpse of freecreditreport.com, and a known scam. My suspicions aroused, I did some Googling on Mills and Johnson and found nothing. I tried calling the company and was told that the line was busy and should leave a message. The fact that they don't have call waiting seems pretty suspect for a company whose About Us page claims they operate in 15 countries. Seems like this was all just a scam preying on my desperate desire to find a job.

Three weeks ago I was interviewed for an IT position as a Support Analyst - everything about it seemed great. The company is growing, and they don't have enough staff to meet the demand. Interview went really well, and I was told that I was favored above all the other applicants. Few days later, I get the job offer. About a week ago, I go in to sign paperwork - contract, tax forms, benefits, etc. All good to go! I start on January 2nd!


Unfortunately not so. I got a call today that they changed their mind, and removed the position. I inquired as to what happened, and the person talking to me had very few details to give. They ""might"" rehire in Feb or March, but couldn't say for sure. I was outraged and wanted to know more, so I called the Vice President whom interviewed me, but he was out, so I had to leave a message.

At the last one we sat down with consultants and they went through our resume, job history etc and they go through the database and suggest jobs for you to apply to.  The conclusion of my consultant was that I am unemployable...

My problem is I have a solid work history doing project management in the construction industry before making the jump in manufacturing and product development.  At my last position I had a 5 person engineering in our Shanghai plant reporting to me and on an org chart was on the same level as the Plant General Manager reporting to the CEO and President.  I won national level awards for my product designs and closed multimillion dollar contracts with Fortune 500 companies.

**The issue is I don't have a degree.**

I was told I should start applying for entry level jobs and remove a lot of my achievements and dumb down my responsibilities and such.  Normally I would think this is insane but after applying for hundreds (literally hundreds I keep a log) of jobs and still not getting anywhere I am willing to give it a shot even if it means taking a job I'm not happy with.

I am consistently told 1.) I was overqualified 2.) Even though the job I apply for is exactly what I was doing before I'm not eligible because I don't have a degree or 3.) No response.

The easy answer here is 'go back to school' and as much as I would love to do that I can't.  I currently live out of my car since my apartment lease came up for renewal and I couldn't provide proof of income (unemployment doesn't qualify), can't get financial aid because my father makes to much money and is a believer in the 'you pay for your own way' line of thinking which I tend to agree with but screws me in this situation.  Student loans aren't really an option because Stafford loans won't cover tuition and I don't have enough credit history to be approved for a traditional loan.

I'm kind of at a loss now and becoming really discouraged so any advice would be great.

It's not free to start out, but it's a good job.

All you need is a Bachelor's in anything. The major does not matter.

Some districts don't even require you to be credentialed at all. You can sometimes pay money for a 1 year waiver to see if it's what you really want to do. This means if you think you'll find a job before the year is up, you don't have to worry about taking any of the tests. 

In California, I took the CBEST test without even studying, and passed everything with above average marks, it's not hard stuff. It's mostly High School Level Proficiency. 

This job is perfect for when you are looking for work because you aren't forced to take a job every day. They call you usually from a phone system, or sometimes you can even go online and see jobs that are posted in the future. This allows you to still job search, go to interviews, etc. without having to take leave really. 

Not to knock Substitute Teachers or anything, but it's pretty much glorified babysitting. The teacher leaves the instructions for the day, and you follow them.

The best part, is that most School Districts are **HURTING** for subs. I went back to my old School District, and it's awesome seeing all my old teachers and giving back to my High School.

The pay isn't extremely well or anything, but at 90 bucks for a full day, and 45 for a half day, it's good pay for what you have to put in. 

Anyway, I thought this might help some people that are looking for work these days. I know it's hard, after 6 months I finally found a part time job that sort of relates to my major. You can all get there, and Subbing can help you!


**Edit**: After reading some of the responses, I should apologize for miselading some people.

Yes, you do have to do an extensive background check. My district paid for my fingerprinting and live scan to be done. 

I had to pay the waiver fee becuase I didn't have a credential, so that was about $75 if I remember correctly. 

I also had to get a TB test done, that was $12 at my local clinic with the forms from the disctrict. 

I should have said this depends obviously on the location. I live in the central coast of California, and all of this area is desperate for Substitute Teachers because of all the mandatory training days and meetings teachers have to take days off for. I guess I was just really lucky? There was a bulletin put out in the disctrict, and I applied, went to a 4 hour orientation, and did the required paperwork. Each district is obviously going to be different.

All I meant this post to be was an out-of-the-box idea that some people might not have thought of. It was meant for those, like me, who are having a hard time finding a full time job with benefits. My area's jobs are spread so thin, that if I didn't sub, I would be underwater in debt, even living with my parents. I didn't really mean for this to be anymore than an idea for people.

You obviously are going to have to call your district up and ask them if they need subs, and what the situation is like. It sounds like a lot of crowded cities have low demand and high supply of teachers, mine is not like this.

Additionally, while at first I was focused in HR, my real love and interest was in training and development. I had experience with it in the military and thought that if I wanted to get into that field as a civilian, I had to go entry level HR. However, in various threads and pm's, I realized that I was selling myself short when it came to my skills. From other veterans posting and so forth, I realized that I could better leverage my military training. 

Finally, I thought I'd hit a dead end in regards to finding a job that didn't dump me based on my credit report. Again, the great people in r/jobs helped me field questions about my poor credit in a way that made it look more like a positive. I reframed my credit issues as a product of the current economy, rather than my poor choices (both of which are very true, I made some really stupid mistakes.)

First of all, I graduated in May with a BA in English. This was the first of many mistakes. I have been employed with a library for 2.5 years now and make $10.86/hour. 

I had been thinking of going back to school for Speech Language Pathology, but the program is so competitive that it seems like a waste (400 applicants, 20 are selected) to gamble away an opportunity to work full-time. Two full-time jobs are open in my building and I am guaranteed to land at least one of them; however, the idea of accepting a job that's going to make it probably nearly impossible for me to do anything more lucrative in life depresses me. The cost of living, in my area, doesn't seem to be horrid (I still live with my parents) but 20k/year isn't impressive. It isn't even ""good."" 

The position in my department (I know what to expect in regard to work) is the same thing I've been doing for two+ years and I interact with the public on a daily basis. The shifts are a few 8-5s and a few 11-8s and either a FRI. or SAT. The other position is upstairs and I would not have to deal with the public, I'd work 8-5 MON.-FRI. and have no weekends. I'm also a decent-looking single twenty-four-year-old who has no outlet for meeting people (The last guy I dated works in my department which is why I'm considering jumping ship on my department to work in another one; long, unpleasant story = lesson learned) so I worry that going upstairs to work in solitude is going to spell out my future as a cat lady. The hours, however, are better - so I have no idea.

**TL;DR** Basically, I never thought I'd be mediocre. I always saw myself as someone who had decent earning potential and as a person who'd really be something someday. Accepting this job means accepting that I'm probably not going to go too far in life, but I need to do something solid (and not gamble on a program that's going to cost me a FT job with benefits if I don't get in).

1348605667.0,63,self.jobs,10gwp5,Some Free Interview Advice.,80,17,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10gwp5/some_free_interview_advice/,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. They seem to be so specialised now that there's probably one called /r/freeinterviewadvice.

Getting to the point. The other week I attended some free training on how to handle interviews. The person running the event was very experienced and had interviewed people for about 10-12 years.

I thought I'd pass on the advice in the hope that it helps someone. Maybe you don't have any events near you or something like that. Anyway, here we go.

1. **Always** take a copy of your CV/resume with you. Fairly straightforward but he mentioned that not everyone does this. Even when interviewers don't ask for it they still like to see it there. His top tip was to carry it with you into the interview, not in a folder or something like that, and place it on the table straight away. You don't even have to give it to them, just having it there is enough. It shows that you are confident and it's almost like you are saying, ""Yeah, there it is. There's my proof that I can walk this.""

2. The advertisement for the position pretty much tells you what they're going to ask. Again fairly obvious but I am just regurgitating the info he fed me. So...  ""You must be a good team worker."" You will be asked about team work. Easy.

3. Answering the interview questions. This is the bit I was most enthusiastic about because I never knew how to answer them. This was honestly the most valuable thing I took away. He says pretty much every interview has a scoring system. Usually there are a total of 5 points to be earned per question then the total is tallied up at the end. Having the highest total doesn't mean you're guaranteed the job but following this properly means you'll be somewhere near the top of the list when they're considering who to hire.

The structure for a good answer goes like this. Here we'll just use, *""What is your experience with working to targets.""*

* 1 point - Simply tell them. Straightforward. You tell them how competent you are/how much experience you have. Or some other variation. Apparently a lot of people just stop here. Don't do this. Examples will be below the points if I can figure out how to format it.

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets.""

* 2 points - Elaborate a bit. Where did you gain some of this experience? Doing what?

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets. When I worked at X our team were given sales targets to hit.""

* 3 points - Introduce another example. Different if possible but if not it can be in the same area.

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets. When I worked at X our team were given sales targets to hit. I also had to work to a *lot* of deadlines when I was at university/college.""

* 4 points - Prove the benefit or show the outcome of your skill/ability. Relate it to your second given example.

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets. When I worked at X our team were given sales targets to hit. I also had to work to a *lot* of deadlines when I was at university/college. But I found that staying organised meant that the projects/essays/whatever were always handed in on time.""

Most good interviewees apparently fall into the 3-4 area. But a really good answer will exceed the criteria.

* 5 points - To exceed the criteria you need to show how your skills have helped other people or the business you worked for.

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets. When I worked at X our team were given sales targets to hit. I also had to work to a *lot* of deadlines when I was at university/college. But I found that staying organised meant that the projects/essays/whatever were always handed in on time. When I was delegated tasks to be completed in small groups my ability to work to targets helped us achieve one of the best marks for X project.""

Realistically you can't exceed the criteria on every question but when you can it will score some big bonus points with the interviewer.

I feel like I'm really underselling how good the advice was. I won't name the company so I seem like some sly promoter. BUT! In literally my first interview since applying this advice I got the job ( I've since left). I was looking for a good few months before applying this advice and had no success. That's why I don't want to put it down to coincidence. I could tell the interviewer was impressed with my answers, or at least it felt that way.

SO: Anticipate the questions through the job advertisement. Answer with some semblance to the format given.

You guys have my coworkers' and my gratitude.**

I was working at a marketing office as a sales. We have a team of 5 people and we all started at the same time. We worked here for about 2 months then last last Tuesday our manager came out of his office and said we're all fired. This was all the president's decision and we were not warned or anything. He fired the whole team on the spot and said we don't have to come in the next day.

so that very Friday was also payday. I got a direct deposit check for that Monday and Tuesday we worked but no money for the whole week before that should have been included in that check. We asked our manager about it and he said he'll tell the president to mail it to us. It's been a week now and still nothing. The president keeps trying to push the topic off when someone asks. And I just heard he fired everyone else at our office today. 

We all feel that it's because of our young age that he thinks it's alright to basically screw us over but I don't want to keep asking him and pretty much beg him for our check. He'll just keep brushing it aside.

What legal actions can I take right now?

My opinion wasn't that influential, if at all, in the ultimate decision, but it was cool to see resumes and ask interview questions.   

I didn't get to comb through lots of resumes, I was just handed the ones that I would be sitting in the interview for.  However what I did notice are things that should go without saying.

Presumably I got the already vetted resumes since we were calling them in for interviews.  Despite this barely any of them were tailored at all for the position.  They were mostly from recent grads, and were very vague resumes with no feeling of what the person actually wanted to do.  Worse some of them were tailored for a job that had nothing to do with the job they were applying for.  What this said to me was, this person, if hired, will not stay.  My take away is, it would not be difficult to be ahead of the crowd by tailoring your resume more.  It seems most job seekers are playing a numbers game.  So you may be able to differentiate yourself by playing a quality game.  

Interviews: To be honest most people did better here, but again many smacked of being unprepared.  Though most demonstrated they had at least looked at our website, they couldn't easily answer questions about situations they might encounter in this job.  My company does market research, so one of the things I asked is to describe to me cases in which they have researched difficult to find information.  This should come easy to anyone with a liberal arts degree, yet this question would stump interviewees.  

Lastly, no interviewee had good questions to ask, that made me feel as though they didn't care about their fit for the job.  Its in both parties interests to have good fits for open positions.  They would normally ask what the dress code was.  No questions about long term promotion potential, or any sort of career development.  No questions about our company culture or management style.

What the actual fuck?",85,19,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wjy9p/i_quit_my_longterm_job_to_take_a_new_job_and_they/,"I graduated from school in 2010 and got a full-time salary job (with full benefits) within 6 months...I was there for 1.5 years, but wanted to get a new job because this place had some changes in management; pay and job growth was too slow; it was just not really going anywhere.  SO, many job applications later, I got a new job that was a bit of an upgrade, but certainly not my dream job. I felt comfortable there though.  

Well, I was only at this job for 6 weeks.  And yes, I could tell that the workload there was a bit slow, many times I didn't have a ton of stuff to do - but there were times where I was kept busy, and I feel as though I was successful with projects given to me during that time.  Yesterday my main boss pulled me into his office (he can't speak English well), and just kept repeating to me ""bad news"" ...""business too slow""...""you find new job ok?""....

uhh, yea, after it sunk it what he was telling me, I pretty much snapped and kinda yelled things along the line of ""why the hell did you hire me in the first place if you're unsure that I could stay!?"" ..""don't people normally hire temps if business is bad?"" ... ""I had a job that I was at for over a year and QUIT to come work for you""  ...Yeah, it was not a pretty conversation; they also tried to turn their financial woes on me, saying that I 'over-qualified my skills', but I know for a fact that they were just trying to make excuses; every project I did they expressed satisfaction with.  I never once over-qualified my abilities.

Yeah, maybe it's against the rules to go off on a boss like how I did, but I don't care, I felt like I needed to stick up for myself in this situation.  I could be understanding of it all if I did something that justified me getting fired, but in this case I've never known of any company to be so financially irresponsible and careless with hiring an employee.  This isn't the mistake of forgetting to give someone a christmas bonus check - this is literally fucking around with a persons life.  I've never felt so disrespected, used, and tossed out.

Now, it's back to the grind of finding a new job, and ideally it will be something much better than what i've experienced.

1328713614.0,65,self.jobs,pgaj0,After only two months I landed a job in my field that is not minimum wage grunt work with no real experience or even a bachelor's degree! Thank you r/jobs for your great advice!,74,9,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pgaj0/after_only_two_months_i_landed_a_job_in_my_field/,"Thursday I was called back after submitting my resume for a social research job (I am a Sociology major taking a year off from undergraduate studies) that pays decently well above minimum wage for not requiring a bachelor's, much experience or too many special skills.  I had the first interview on friday and the second interview on tuesday and was called back this morning and was hired.

Basically, I will be a field interviewer for a large study funded by the State of Wisconsin with a good potential to be hired on for continued employment for other studies. I drive around Madison, WI for interviews but other than that set my own hours and work from home.

The advice that I gleaned from r/jobs and applied to getting the position is pretty extensive, but let me try to recap.  

1) Use r/resumes, but take advice with a grain of salt.  Realize there are a lot of ways to format a resume. Look at other peoples' resumes and think about if they are clear and organized well and use similar styling.

2) Your second draft of your resume is not your final draft.  Rework it many, many times and save each draft. Someone might tell you your most recent draft is not as good as a previous one, it happens.

3) Dress your best.  I had interviews for fast food, retail, $80,000/yr military jobs, etc and I wore the same thing to every single one.  Black pantsuit (navy might be better even), pressed white shirt, conservative jewelry, no nail polish, light makeup, black closed-toe shoes.  It doesn't matter what you are applying for, dress like your career depends on it.

4) Research bad interview habits. I never knew I bit the inside of my mouth during interviews until I read about bad habits.  Get to an interview ten minutes early at least. I always practiced answers to probable questions in the shower or car ride to the interview. NEVER wing an interview.

5) Be aware during an interview. Don't start a sentence without knowing where it is going. Interviewers don't mind if you think about a question for a minute before answering, but don't plow into an answer without knowing where you are going.  Be mindful of your hands (aka keep them on the table), posture, your smile and ""ums or uhs"".

6) Practice your handshake. I don't care if you are a football athlete or a 98 lb. girl if you shake hands like you are a dead fish you are going to put off your interviewer right away. Firm! Make eye contact!

7)  If someone asks you how you feel about handling a responsibility or how you would deal with a situation don't make up a hypothetical or just respond, ""Good"" or ""I can do that"".  Draw from your experience, give examples of how you have done related work.  

8) Always be selling yourself. Don't say things like: I need the money, I want the skills, I need the job for my resume, or I want to get my foot in the door in the industry. 

9)  Follow-up with a thank you no matter what and a phone call if they don't get back to you.

10) Don't give up! Granted, I was very lucky to get a job so quick but I was rejected from many a higher paying job that, looking back, I realize I would have hated. I was going for the money and not the long term benefit to my passions and goals.  Interviewers can tell when you have thrown in the towel. Pump up with good music, dance around your house, or stop on the way there for ice cream or another favorite treat to get your mood up!

1316276047.0,66,self.jobs,kiqfr,Resume tips from a hiring manager,76,10,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kiqfr/resume_tips_from_a_hiring_manager/,"I'm a manager who is trying to find a bunch of good folks. 90% of the resumes I receive stink.

The best advice I can give is: Spend a lot of time on your resume. This is your one shot to get my attention and you have around 30 seconds to reel me in. 

* Proofread: I can't tell you how often I see resumes with typographical errors, filled with jargon, or that don't make sense. I'm looking for folks with an attention to detail and an error on a resume is inexcusable. You should have at least 5 people proofread your resume, make suggestions, etc. Friends, family, the internet, etc.

* Watch your tenses. It drives me nuts when someone mixes tenses. Even worse, I've seen a few resumes where the person's current job duties are in the past tense, and their past jobs are in the current tense. Pick a tense and stick with it. 

* Unless it's on paper, ignore the advice about keeping it short. I'm looking at your resume on a screen. I have a scroll wheel on my mouse and I know how to use it. I recommend a ""project based"" resume. List your position, some high level info about your duties, and then show me the projects you worked on. The header can be the name of the project and a short description. Try to use numbers and facts for impact. ""Project X - Led 10 member team on a 25 million dollar project to replace legacy system.... resulted in savings of 5 million dollars per year."" Under that, list the duties you had for the project. This also feeds into the next point:

* Search Engine Optimization. Almost every company is using electronic recruiting systems. Many of these search by comparing the job description keywords to your resume. As an example, if the job is for a Business Analyst, make sure ""Elicited requirements"" is in your resume much as it can be. This applies to the point above. If you ""Elicited requirements"" on all of the projects you've worked on, you've just included that phrase several times in a project based resume. On the other hand, keyword stuff is bad. I've seen resumes along the lines of: ""A good business analyst is a business analyst who analyzes requirements."" 

* Be a little creative with the formatting. When I was searching for a job, I used a blue color scheme on my resume. There are many templates out there that can help, but the last thing I want to see is 4 pages in the same color, font, and font size. It feels like work. Try to format it so the most important information jumps out. 

* Make your resume applicable to the job. I see a lot of resumes where the applicant doesn't even bother to change the objective objective. I've seen objective statements that mention a desire to teach children, drive trucks, etc. Spend the few minutes it takes to write a specific objective. Even better, keep a version of the resume for each career track you're applying for. If you try to make one resume for all the careers you're interested in, you'll appear to lack specific skills, or even worse, desparate! Yes, this does take time, but if it's your job to find a job, you should be spending ~8 hours a day on it. 

* Make sure your objective is skewed to how YOU will help the company. Objectives like ""I want to find a position that will help me hone my writing skills"". To me, that says I'm paying you to learn how to write, until you're good enough to go and fine something else. Much better would be something like ""I would like to find a position where my excellent technical writing skills will improve efficiency, quality.....""

* If you don't like the idea of the objective statement, consider using a ""Summary"". Either one is your chance to let your personality shine through and get the hiring manager interested.

* Unless you're delivering it in person, don't rely on the cover letter. It's unlikely they'll be read at all, or only read after you ""hook"" me with the resume. If I do read it, and it ""smells"" like a boilerplate letter, you've actually lost credibility. Overall, make sure it's not a ""Re-tread"" of the resume. The cover leader should be high level and it should include information about the company, position, etc. Think of it as a sales brochure. Example: Instead of ""My C++, PHP, HTML, XML... experience is ideal"", do something like ""My extensive experience with multiple programming languages...""

* Watch your e-mail address. Make sure your e-mail address is something professional. firstname.lastname@gmail.com is ideal. I see a lot of resumes with e-mails like buffguy69@aol.com. That's an epic fail. 

* Keep tweaking and testing. Learn from your experiences

Hope this helps!

Let me just start off by saying I'm tired, so sorry about the quality.

I started working for a web startup a while ago, and really enjoyed the job. Not only did I enjoy it but was given plenty of room to grow. This lead to me learning a lot and getting really involved. Eventually, the company wanted to consolidate to save money and become more efficient.

Out of 20 employees in our branch, I was the only one offered to come help transition operations. Basically, my job was to do everything we did in our US office, but in a lighter fashion. It was really fun and exciting!

As we went through this restructure, I was able to make everything I did really efficient. So much so, that it wasn't really necessary for me to do the work any more. I had it so down, that I was able to get others to help me out, and get my duties done in half the time, without my involvement at all.

So I was promoted up to the highest non-upper management position within the company, which was a huge honor! Unfortunately for me, the position wasn't a great fit. It was extremely stressful, because I didn't realize I'd be working 14 hour days which is something I just wont do for my own sanity. Also unfortunately for me, my former position no longer existed, as I consolidated it into other departments. So I had the option of either taking a really low position job, or resign, and wait until another position opens up elsewhere in another company owned by our parent company.

I decided that after nearly 2 years with no vacation, I could really use a 2 month vacation. So I decided to fly back to the USA and relax for a while. I NEEDED IT SO BAD!!!

A few days before leaving, I started noticing weird vibes from the upper management around me. Whatever, I leave in a few days, and it's probably just the weather. So I thought nothing of it.

----------------------

Any ways, while I'm back home, I keep in contact with my old manager and keep trying to follow up with him on the status of finding another job within the other company. I kept getting told he was looking and was forwarding my resume. 

Time goes on, and I start getting impatient, it's been almost 3 months now, and nothing is happening. So I get aggressive and finally get a call from one of the managers... The first thing they told me when I picked up the phone was, ""Circ-Le-Jerk, I will never recommend you for a job, much less forward you a resume."" WTF...... I didn't see that fucking coming. 

Let's go back a little bit. See, right after I found out I was leaving, I caught back up with an old friend I knew. She worked for another web company that my companies founders had really bad blood with. She recommended that I should apply to her company, just to see if there is anything that I may like. Maybe they'd have a really good offer.

Now, I didn't really think this was much of a big deal. People in the tech industry tend to go between companies all the time. However, I didn't realize, this would be my undoing, considering the bad blood between the founders.

Apparently, as I found out during this phone call, I intentionally BCC'ed the entire HR department of my old company when I applied there. From their perspective, I did it intentionally, and was a huge insult to everyone there. It wasn't so much me looking at other companies, it was because it looked like I was rubbing it in. 

From my perspective, my BCC to my friend ""Jobe"" was very similar to ""Jobs"" and I accidentally let GMail autofill the contact to jobs@company.com

I recently had an interview that was arranged through a friend, and had the following conversation with an interviewer:

Interviewer: we like to look for loyalty in our employees.  How do you show your loyalty to an employer?

Me: I'm sorry can you clarify?

Interviewer: well we like to hire employees who are interested in the long haul and aren't looking to make a quick buck

Me : Oh, ok, umm, well I think there is something to loyalty and mutual respect between employers and employees...*[rest of answer]*

Why is this relevant, well said company recently laid off over 1,000 people.  They have a long history of laying off people in bad times and hiring them back at lower wages in good.  I knew this and I know the risk, but the job was interesting.  But SERIOUSLY loyalty is a two way street.  You have this reputation and have the gall to ask about my loyalty?  You are asking because you clearly want to recruit people who are loyal to you beyond what is in their interest, you want an employee that you can take advantage of.  You are being sued for age discrimination because you laid off people near retirement and my loyalty is your concern?  Loyalty is earned, as is respect, from both ends.  I see lots of articles on here about 'why you didn't hire me'.  Honestly, many people are in positions where they don't have the option of rejecting jobs, but even those forced to accept a position will be instantly looking for better options when a publicly disloyal company is asking about their loyalty.  Its a setup and a trap and people aren't stupid.  Respect me and be loyal to me (and yes this starts in the interview process) and you will see the same in return.  Don't, and well don't be surprised when we level the playing field and take our cues of action from how you treat us.

This will be long, I hope someone reads it. 

In 2010 I received my degree in Art History, regardless of the grim outlook on jobs and the jokes made about that specific degree. Of course, near the end of the school year I was feeling a sense of dread at the glaring lack of jobs for that field. After graduation my wife and I moved to Oakland, CA to stay with my Aunt while we looked for work. After months we were lucky to get jobs at a pizza parlor, which was funny since that was the job I had before entering college. A month or so later my wife got a job with the Exploratorium in SF, I followed shortly, although my position was part-time and temporary. At this point we were doing better, feeling a lot better, but were still stuck at my Aunt's house (a halfway house in reality).  

After about 6 months in, I got a tip and applied for a museum in San San Francisco. After just a week or so and two interviews, I was the new full time web and graphics guy. My wife and I moved to SF in a friends spare room, and I was able to walk to work in 10 minutes. It was pretty amazing. Out of 30 or so Art History grads, I was one of the few that was actually working in a museum. 

Well, after a few months the job started to show some negatives, as all jobs can do if you let them, but these were getting bigger. My job description was quite large, but I was really only doing the same few tasks over and over again, every day. I could do anything else happily, but once other departments learned I could do these repetitive tasks, they all started asking me to do them. So it was Groundhog Day in a museum setting. I started to dwell on the fact that I was doing the same tasks over and over, barely ever spent time in the actual art portion of the museum, and was really doing a job that anyone with some computer knowledge could do. My degree opened the door, as many say, but it could have been a degree in anything. I just got more and more depressed, and then started looking for other work. 

I ended up landing a job for an online technology school, one that teaches coding, and moved my family an hour away from SF. It was a pretty good raise, was in the education field which I also enjoy, and was in a nice city. This place though, was truly a mess. Regardless of any negative lens I could be looking through, they were doing some unscrupulous things, and the student was the last thing they cared about and frequently mentioned it. I was now away from art of all kinds, working with greedy and cruel coworkers, and was not in a position to add anything positive the lives of the students of that school. After 6 months of trying my hardest, I finally succumbed to letting my disappointment shine through, and I was laid off on Halloween. The trick was on me. 

In just a weeks time we had to pack up and move back to my hometown, a place where the unemployment rate is about 14%. We are now living on my unemployment check, with my wife, daughter, and myself in a 1 bedroom apartment. In the past 6 months I have turned in over 100 applications with only 2 interviews. My wife has turned in 100's and has had 1 opportunity to take a test, just to get an interview. I finally got a part-time job, but its 18 hours a week and if my unemployment goes away, we won't be able to keep going. With school loans, car payment, meager bills, and our habit of eating food for sustenance, this job is just not enough. 

In between work, and constantly looking for jobs, I think a lot about that museum job. I can't remember anymore why I was THAT unhappy. Sure I did repetitive tasks, and wasn't doing exactly what I thought I would be, but it paid well. My family had health care, we had extra money to do fun things, my coworkers liked me, and we lived in the Bay Area. So I think the lesson I learned, and I hope what stands out about this story, is that it would have been a good idea to sit down and really think about my feelings. Was I really that unhappy? Or did the start of my unhappiness just put me on a path to get upset about every little thing, and make an ok job worse and worse? I see a lot of posts about being unhappy at the job, and many of them could be that persons time to leave. I guess, I just hope that no one makes the same mistake I did. I think about that job a lot, the future I could have had, and most importantly how I changed my families lives. It's really sad to think that it was all changed simply because I wasn't as comfortable as I thought I should be, especially in an economy like this one. Don't be like me.

He mentioned that my results were 'low' and he needed to call each reference to make sure they did not incorrectly grade me by confusion.

Three weeks later after he said this, I get the following email:

""Unfortunately, due to the initial reference checks and other changes happening in the unit we will not be able to continue the hiring process.""

I am not sure if I had one bad reference out of the five, but it was really odd that this happened. I know for a fact that most, if not all, of my references would say anything bad about me as I am still in contact with them to this day and emailed them beforehand if I could use them as a reference. I am still confused if they actually hired internally and tried to cover their ass since they sent me a job offer (written) by confusion and said my references were too low.

Anyway, just wanted to throw this out their as another oddity in my job hunt. I was so close to getting the job, it was a real heart breaker, especially after getting a verbal and written offer.

Mock interviews are great! Looks up questions for your field, answer them and say them outloud.
Tell your family and friends about upcoming interviews. Their prayers, well wishes, luck dances, whatever will help you build confidence!

Apparently the hiring manager threw a living fit because he'd called in several people to conduct the interview and I was ""wasting his time."" (Like actually going to the interview when I had no intention of taking the job wasn't?) I wouldn't be surprised if that got me blacklisted, and you can see how stupid blacklists are. 

**#5 Automated Resume Processing:** Do you ever go through your spam folder just to check that you hadn't missed anything important? Do you do that more or less often than you go through the resumes rejected by your automated resume processing system written by the lowest bidder to make sure it's not kicking out people that would be perfect for your company? 

**#4 Drug Testing:** As indicated above, this is usually set by corporate headquarters, so not much you can do here. But it's a ridiculous policy. If someone comes into work drunk or high, you fire them. If they show up on time and do their job, why do you care what they do on their off hours? 

**#3 Background Checks:** I strongly support legislation requiring disclosure to applicants of background check reports used to disqualify them for a job, so they can verify the records. But here's the question: did you run background checks on the people who are telling you who you should hire? Probably not. When the background check process was set up, did you go straight to your manager and insist they run a background check on you and fire you if anything bad comes up? If not, do it right now. If you don't want to, then you don't trust the system you're using to screen employees. 

Yeah, that's smart. 

**#2 Social Profiles:** Give me the names of your roommates from college and all your yearbooks and let me decide if you can keep your job. If this seems like a bad idea, then why does it make sense for people you hire? Why? Because when *you* had a red cup full of puregrain alcohol in your hand at 18, that was a long time ago and it was just a party. But when the poor schmuck you're interviewing has a photo on his Facebook page with a red cup in his hand, we'll just assume it's his eighteenth beer of the night and he was getting ready to drive home and rape someone's daughter. It's safer that way. 

**#1 Being Unemployed Means Staying Unemployed:** This nonlogic is truly too stupid for words. Stuff happens in this economy - jobs are cancelled, people are laid off, and sometimes people just walk out of bad jobs. And maybe they didn't just take the first job that came along - they're looking for the right fit. Isn't that what you ""write me a cover letter that shows you love me"" types want to hear? 

Also consider  that someone who put a gap in their employment on their resume is the one that's being honest, as opposed to ""contracting"" or ""running my own business"" or the other things we've learned to cover with. As for ""maybe their skills are fading"" - if you're hiring a professional who's got nothing but free time on their hands, why would you think they won't have better skills than someone who's stuck in a treadmill job? 

As I have indicated - these are all the result of knee-jerk reactions to just make the job easier without any actual consideration as to whether they are actually having the desired effect. It's the equivalent of handing someone a hundred resumes to review and they just grab the top half of the stack and shred it because who wants to hire people with bad luck?

The job description actually sounded like it was written with him in mind.  His initial phone interview was a slam dunk, and the follow up interview with two of the firm's partners went extremely well, by all accounts.

A week later, one of the partners phoned to thank him for participating in the interview process, but had to regretfully inform him that they selected another candidate.  He was pretty devastated, and bitter.  It was a job he really wanted, and thought for sure he was a shoe-in for.  When he told me about this, I advised him to write a thank you note to the firm, as difficult as it might be at this point.  

He asked ""Why?"".  I responded ""For a number of reasons."":

* It reflects graciousness on your part, especially at a moment when most people aren't very gracious, thus differentiating you as someone unique.

* That graciousness will elevate your stature in the eyes of the people who passed you over, and might even make them question themselves for having done so.

* If things don't work out with their selected candidate, that gracious thank you note might just propel you to the top of the list of rejected candidates worth revisiting for a second look.

* It might make them realize what a quality candidate you are and spur them to see if there's any other openings at their firm that you might not have been aware of and which they now feel you might be a good fit for.


He begrudgingly agreed and asked for my help in crafting the note.  I told him it should pattern itself on the following structure:

* Acknowledgement of their decision
* Expression of disappointment (without sounding devastated or bitter)
* Sincere wishes for success with their selection
* Expression of thanks for the opportunity to interview with them
* A request to keep him in mind if things don't work out with their selection

He followed my advice and immediately received a response indicating that he was at the top of their list to contact if their selected candidate didn't work out.

**TL;DR - If you get passed over for a job, take the time to write a thank you note.  Almost no one does it, and it's a great way to stand out from the crowd.**",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_z09bo,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z09bo/writing_a_thank_you_note_after_being_passed_over/,

My name is Jon and although you might not know it yet, YOU have just received a very special opportunity to make your business infinitely more awesome. You see, even though I rock as a bartender, hold a college degree from a major university, and have 5 years of full-time, international bartending experience, I JUST relocated to Michigan and currently find myself unemployed.  I wish to remedy this situation by making you (as well as me) lots and lots of money. I must, however, give fair warning about a particular issue before I proceed with wowing you. You see, although I have advanced through the ranks quickly at every bar I have worked at, receiving rave reviews, I do NOT have blonde hair and large breasts. Yes, I am one of the unfortunate few that is forced to try and bartend while dealing with the cumbersome burden that is the male genitalia.  Do not let this discourage you when deciding my viability as a future employee! Why not? Because I just happen to rock as a member of the hospitality industry.  Prove it, you say? Well, just consider these awesome and informative facts* about myself that are in no way made up or embellished.
 
1) My smile has been evaluated by psychiatrists as a potential alternative to prescribing anti-anxiety medication. 

2) I have made chocolate martinis that are so unbelievably delicious they have completely cured individuals who are suffering from clinical depression

3) I have been known, on multiple occasions, to literally charm the pants off of people. Rest easy, however, because although I have this ability, I adhere strictly to health codes and will do my very best to keep customers clothed. 

4) I work so quickly and efficiently that scientists had to add addendums to various laws of physics.
  
5) I have been told by multiple sources told I am the most special boy in the whole wide world**

6) I am the bartender your establishment deserves, even if I’m not the one you need right now. 

7) As a depiction of my wizardry behind the bar, I present the following video evidence of myself in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjR-rFqXFls

8) Not only am I housebroken and play well with others but I also I do not have a bedtime or family obligations. This means that I have negligible schedule restrictions and will be able to devote my full attention to your establishment. 

9) I once met David Hasselhoff at a random bar in Costa Rica.

10) I was the first one to complete my ServeSafe bartending qualification. In all fairness there were only two of us taking it that day but it still made me feel studious and knowledgeable.  

11) I have such a detailed working knowledge of wine and craft beer that I am absolutely certain I could convince the Most Interesting Man In The World to drink something besides Dos Equis and enjoy it. 

12) My phone is equipped with a state of the art alarm, which means that barring any unexpected encounters with a rift in the space-time continuum I will always be on time. 

 So as you can see, I should definitely be your newest employee. I invite you to give me a call or send me an email to set up an interview.  You won’t be disappointed, I promise! I’ve also attached my formal resume just incase you would like to further explore my qualifications without my obnoxious witticisms.

1376430638.0,58,self.jobs,1kb2dy,My first experience from the other side: I'm a newly minted supervisor and I just went through a pile of resumes and invited folks on interviews. I was surprised at what drove my decisions.,70,12,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kb2dy/my_first_experience_from_the_other_side_im_a/,"Let me just preface this by saying I AM NOT A HUMAN RESOURCES PROFESSIONAL. I'm a working professional who supervises a team of 4 to 6 people and I was asked by my HR person to go through resumes and applications to invite people to interview and fill a spot on that team. This is my first experience at something like this and I'm completely untrained in HR, so I thought I'd make this post and give you a sort of first impressions/inside look at the other side. I figured it's likely that many of you are applying to jobs where someone with no HR experience or training is making these decisions as well. This is only my perspective from the first time doing this and it may be very specific to my job and profession, but I thought sharing anything might be good, even if it just starts a discussion and lets me process this better so I can improve myself for the next time I'm hiring. I've spent my whole life on the other side of this as an applicant and it was really interesting and weird to be on the employer/interviewer side of it. I did things that my applicant self probably wouldn't like, but my supervisor/interviewer self felt justified in doing. Here are just a few things I noted. 

**-The details matter.** You all know this already and it's nothing new but it was weird to see it first hand. It was always a fear of mine as an applicant that I'd find a minor spelling error on the resume/CV that I'd just submitted to a couple dozen places. And guess what, somebody misspelled ""fasinated"" on the first application I looked at and I still tried to give them a fair shot but it was hard (I asked myself if she would have been a good candidate anyway just to be fair and she wouldn't have, but it was certainly a bit of a shortcut I could have taken). I judged people for seemingly trivial things (i.e. font choice, resume layout, unprofessional e-mail address, etc.). Those things were definitely not make or break errors, but it was just an annoyance that they had to overcome. 

**-Brevity is the soul of employment.** I probably didn't spend more than 60 seconds looking through any given resume + application packet so resumes were getting skimmed and not fully read. Bullet points and brevity are your friend (and I immediately realized all my past resumes/CVs were not friendly in this way and smacked myself because, as you can tell from this posting, I'm wordy as fuck). I work all day and don't have time set aside for HR stuff and I had to look through about 30-40 applications over my lunch break. I don't have time to read every last detail about the last job you had. Tell me in a couple bullet points or I'll make up my mind on the few words I did skim what I think you did in that job/internship.

**-Certifications and licenses matter.** This may be profession specific, but if you actually take the time to get certified or licensed in a field that you are working in, then you are much more marketable on the job market at large, and in this case, as a professional in the agency I work for. It may cost you up front in money, time, supervision, or whatever to get licensed/certified but these things matter. The specific job I was hiring for could be done by somebody with or without a bachelor's level license/certification. But even though I knew that, I always leaned more towards people with these licenses/certifications because they are just much more flexible. I didn't want to hire someone and then have them unable to help the team out because they can't perform duty X because they aren't licensed to provide duty X, even if duty X isn't their primary responsibility in the job they are applying for. As an applicant, I'd be shouting ""aww come on, then either say you require a license or don't give applicants duty X as a responsibility"" but as a supervisor I understand it. I'm dealing with it right now trying to cover for team members who left and whose spot I'm filling. There are some other team members that can't cover certain duties because of this lack of certification, so flexibility is huge. 

**-Take applications seriously.** I understand it's easier to write ""see resume"" instead of hand writing your whole job history. I think it's stupid and redundant from both the applicant and employer side, but the tiny benefit that it did give me was a consistent format for evaluating job history and skills. Peoples' resumes are all over the place in formatting and experience. I was able to pare down the last couple people being considered for interviews easily because I could put their applications together and compare their job histories and skills with a consistent format (unlike resumes).

**-Apply for a specific job.** The applicant in me hates this one. As an applicant you try to be open to so many job opportunities because you just want to work. You may be open to just about any job at an agency. I understand casting a broad net as an applicant, but I did judge people when on the application it asked what position they were applying for and their response was ""any available"" or listed 3 or more positions. Again, I checked my bias and tried to make it past this and I don't think it hurt the people that cast the broad net as much as it helped the ones who applied specifically for this position. Also, when I'm hiring for a specific position and I see resume objectives that are so broad they could apply to anything from airplane pilot to janitor to President of the United States, it doesn't really tell me why I should hire you for this job that I need done.

**-Don't try to say what you think we want to hear, because we don't know what we want to hear.** I always tried to think when I was an applicant ""what would the supervisor or HR person want to hear"" and I now realize that is very difficult to predict. There's no good answer to this. Reading these resumes and applications, I didn't really know what I wanted to hear, but I knew it when I heard it. So I guess the advice would be to get out of the supervisor and HR person's head. They don't even know what they're looking for. Stay in your own head and write what makes sense to you in the context of the position you are applying for. 

**-I judge where you went to school.**  Online colleges weren't immediate rejections, but they would have needed to make a lot of ground up in other areas for me to overcome this (and none did). I understand life happens and some circumstances make online school your only option, but if you can go to a good college or university and graduate that takes a bit more of a commitment and effort (maybe not true, but that's the perception). I didn't do too much judging like small liberal arts school versus community college transfer versus big state school types of things because I actually think each of those has excellent merits. I could see where others might though.  

**-I judged your GPA too.** I don't have much to go on and only 60 seconds to do so. If you had a 2.0 GPA, sure it's possible that you had to fight and struggle against a learning disability or some other extraordinary external circumstances and getting C's was actually a huge success, but I'm more likely to make the assumption that you're a ""I'll do the minimum I have to do to get by"" kind of person. It's unfair, but I don't have much else to go on in 60 seconds. Again, not a deal breaker but you better show me something somewhere else that makes up for it. 

I'll qualify all this by saying that I was aware of the unfairness of these things and actively worked to give everyone a fair shot and put myself in their shoes. I actually went back into my NO pile after being a bit more aware of the bias at the end and rechecked the first half that I had looked at and one of them ended up getting an interview after I reevaluated. So even somebody aware of the trivial and wacky nature of this whole process needed a self-check to get it right. I didn't just throw a font/format I didn't like in the NO pile if that's what it seems like, but it was a minor annoyance that wasn't a good way to start. I'd liken it to falling behind in the first quarter of a game. You haven't lost, but you have to make up some ground. 

Anyway, a lot of this probably isn't news to you at all. I've probably read these points many times when I was applying, but it makes sense to me now being on the other side.  Some of these things maybe you just can't do anything about and maybe these points just make you feel worse. Sorry about that. Just thought I'd share my experience. And this was obviously just the interview selection process. If I have a free minute to get another post in next week, maybe I'll share my thoughts about the actual interviews as well. Good luck guys.

1296750888.0,58,self.jobs,fekt6,I just finished reviewing more than 15 resumes for 2 entry-to-mid-level IT positions. Here are my thoughts.,62,4,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fekt6/i_just_finished_reviewing_more_than_15_resumes/,"I just finished reviewing more than 15 resumes for 2 entry-to-mid-level IT positions ($50k - $60k / yr). I am not going to bring in all of the applicants for an interview for a 1 hour interview with another hour of prep and wrap-up would take an entire week of my time. I have a division to run and I simply can’t afford to do it. Some of them are getting interviews and some aren’t.  So, here are a few tips for prospective job hunters.

1.	For god’s sake, proofread your resume. This is the first work product you are delivering and it is a direct reflection on the impression of your future work products. If someone’s resume is un-readable, I don’t want to worry about un-readable work going forward. This does directly impact your chance at an interview and a job.

	a)	Press F7 and run spell check. Also, look for spelling mistakes that spell-check won’t catch. I’m pretty sure you did not actually oversea the project team.

	b)	Check your grammar. If your grammar isn’t that great, have someone check it for you.

	c)	Use consistent tense. Previous work was in the past tense and current work is in the present tense. 

	d)	Use consistent formatting across your resume. Don’t switch from all bullets to all paragraphs then back. 

	e)	Line breaks are your friend. 300 words in a giant block of text is not going to get read. 

2.	Most places upload resumes into an HR system which spit-out a format-scrubbed text file to the hiring manager. Make sure your resume looks good when it’s stripped naked. Copy paste to notepad to see how it looks. Bullet points in particular tend to look strange when converted.

3.	If you use an acronym, spell it out then put the acronym in parenthesis. I know what a VPN is, but I have no idea what the EFRINS division does at your previous employer.

4.	If you were a contractor at a client, make that clear. 

	BIG COMPANY XYZ via CONSULTING COMPANY ABC

	or

	CONSULTING COMPANY ABC: PROJCET ALPHA at BIG COMPANY XYZ
	
	If I have to guess, it makes me doubtful.

5.	If you have a degree, list the school and the major. Don’t make me guess. If you haven’t graduated, make that clear. If your major is not related to the job, list it anyway. If it’s in anyway unclear, I’ll have to guess and that too makes me doubtful. 

I know a lot of people who think “But my skills should speak for themselves” or “I’m applying for an IT job, writing skills are not necessary”. To them I have two things to say. First, remember this is a competition. Your resume is being compared to the ones I read before or after yours. All other things being equal, I’m not going to try to plod my way through your mud-pit of a resume when the next one on the pile is clear and concise. It’s going in the no-pile. Second, communication skills are absolutely necessary for an IT job. I need standard operating procedures and business cases. I need my IT person to explain things to my accountants. If you can’t write, I probably don’t want you on my team.

Remember, your resume is your foot-in-the door. If I can’t read it easily, I probably won’t read it at all.

They want something like $300 to remove the picture, and then, from what I've read, the owner will put it up on another one of his mugshot websites and you will have to pay them to remove it from the new site. This seems like extortion and I do believe this is an abuse of the right to public information.

Any help would be appreciated. I've emailed Google, not really expecting them to do anything, but it was worth a shot.

Yes, it pays great and has amazing benefits, but working nearly 16 hours a day, no vacation and being constantly verbally abused is not what I signed up for. 

Take today for instance. I just got chewed out by my boss telling me that I should've informed him of the system issues I was having earlier so he could've taken a look at it. I did. I sent him 8 emails in the morning, none of which he responded to. 

That's just the icing on the cake. I can't get a hold of my bosses. None of them. Ever. We need to make a decision on a service package by today, and NO ONE is around to do a final call. We had to push back our meeting with our big clients and now I'm getting the heat for it? 

I'm done, seriously. I'm under so much stress that I can't even focus anymore.  I've absolutely HAD IT. 

How do I quit? I've never done it before. We're mostly a telecommuter company, so I don't see my bosses more than once every few months. Can I send an email? How does this work? I also now need to look for a job, which sucks. I want out more than I need a job. That's how much I hate this job. 

Quitting is however, going to cause a lot of problems for the company. There's a lot of tasks that I'm responsible for that no one else has the skills for.

Hey. I want this position, but I don't have experience. I understand the area of expenses and am willing to work for $12/hour to make up for the lack of experience.

We are all salaried employees, so none of us get any overtime. Just the promise that our efforts will be remembered in the future.

From speaking to friends, they too are seeing people forced to work well beyond 40 hours just to meet the minimum requirements of their jobs. These aren't people trying to impress the boss or get ahead on their work, these are people who are forced to work 12 hour days because thats what their job now requires.

I am 26 years old. My brother is 32. I talk to him about it and he said when he started, things weren't like this. Yeah, the young guys were often forced to pick up the slack, but this wasn't a regular thing, and they were compensated for their time.

I luckily haven't had to work much more than a 55 hour week, but many of my colleagues are pushing 70 hours every single week.

I know that technically there aren't any laws being broken. When I signed on with this company, my job offer stated that I may be required to work some extra hours. However, it seems ""some extra hours"" means 3-4 extra hours each night and a few on weekends. I had a wedding out of town a few weeks ago, and I felt that I was looked down upon by my superiors because I stated I would be completely unavailable all day Saturday.

Is this the new normal? I feel like people are forced to work long hours because employers know there isn't much else out there at the moment.

* LinkedIn account- made connections, got recommendations, applied to positions and checked consistently for new postings

* Signed up and applied to other postings on other job boards such as simplyhired, indeed, monster, etc...

* Edited and made sure my resume was as good as it could be

* Had 3 different cover letters for the three different types of positions I was applying for and would modify and edit it to make it unique for the job I was applying for
 
* Reached out to all my network connections
 
* Woke up early, showered, dressed, coffee- treat the job hunt like a job, 8-5
 
* and most important*** I made a person website. Buy your name at a .com domain and put a personal video introducing yourself, a picture, an ""about me,"" your resume, references, portfolio, etc...
 
* At the interview, have a resume on resume paper and in a clear report cover


In my final interview, I was with the CEO and the first thing he did was compliment me on my website and told me that was the reason I was there amidst the 900 applications they received for the position. He said the there were so many generic cover letter, terrible resumes, or no cover letters. Anything you can do to differentiate yourself and show tenacity is going to get you a shot to interview.

One last thing I can say is to be friendly and personable in the interviews... do NOT be a robot. They want to hire people they want to be friends with. They will most likely hire someone personable even if they are less qualified than the robot.

I ended up helping out three posters, to the tune of about $130 last night. A hungry family, a lonely girl and a guy who'd had a shitty day.

After spending 2 hours trying to order for them (being in the UK is a pain), they got their om noms and I eventually went to sleep.

I woke up to an email from Paypal, saying that my account had been limited and that they needed more information on recent transactions. They also requested me to send in more documentation and confirm other details. I did everything and called them up - they said they would expedite my review and I would hear back shortly.

30 minutes later, I receive an email saying my account has been closed, indefinitely - and that I could not appeal. I instantly contacted someone I know who used to work for Paypal, who put me in touch with someone fairly high up. That person got the account reviewed again, and in the end - I received the same email with a ""THIS DECISION IS FINAL"" message appended. The reason I was given is that consultancy and freelance work is apparently too high a risk for Paypal.

I'm just throwing this out here to warn all of the people in /r/jobs, /r/forhire and reddit at large - of why Paypal has all of those rumors behind it, it turns out they're true.",,False,,t5_2qhnd,True,,,True,t3_mfpwk,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mfpwk/a_tale_of_paypal_pizza_and_why_the_former_sucks/,

 - Was laid off not too long ago, due to business being slow.

- Was told that there would be a cooperation with unemployment benefits.  That's cool, because I need that money until I find a new job.

- I filed for unemployment - it was verified as a valid claim on my benefits website/profile, everything seems to be going smoothly, I should be getting my first payment next week.

**** (This is where it gets weird and I'm kinda confused):  I get an e-mail from my ex-employers recently, saying that they would like to offer me a months worth of severance money, but in order for them to do that, I would need to sign a contract saying that I was fired/terminated (*instead* of laid-off).


I don't feel comfortable signing anything, and also I'm not an idiot - I know that signing something which states that I was 'terminated' will hurt my chances of keeping unemployment benefits.   The advice I've gotten from friends is to not even respond to their e-mail, so I haven't.  It's been 10 days, and within that 10 day timespan, I've gotten two further e-mails from them, saying that not only do I need to sign this termination letter to get the severance, but *'in order for my unemployment benefits to be approved, I NEED to sign this termination contract.'*  Umm really?  Because that smells like complete BS...i've never heard of anyone needing to sign a contract to get benefits.

I believe they are trying to trick me into signing the contract so that they can get out of dealing with my benefits (and having their insurance premiums go up).  I STILL haven't responded to them, even though they've sent me 3 pushy e-mails so far.  I don't believe that I have an obligation to reply to them, and if it says online that my benefits are deemed valid and will be in my checking account soon, then isn't that all that matters? 

Basically, I came here for some insight because I've never had to deal with anything like this before.  Am I doing the right thing by not responding to their badgering e-mails?  If the state has approved my unemployment claim as being valid, then is that all that matters?  Are what my ex-employers doing even legal - i.e contacting me on my personal e-mail address and saying ""you must sign this contract in order for benefits to be approved"".  It sounds like a shady lie, yes?

I love my job. Seriously, I have a blast at work and I'm paid decently for what I do. That said, the politics at this company are a little wonky. Its a small company with small company intrigue.

I usually stay out of drama and try to keep a positive attitude. That said, some things were/are going on that is trying to make 1 guy's job so hard that he quits. Having just spent 2 years looking for a job, I can sympathize that this seriously sucks. I ended up saying things I shouldn't have that pretty much let this guy know what's going on. I should have anticipated him blowing up about it. 

In short, in trying to help a guy keep his job, I'm now probably going to lose mine because I spoke to him about it. Worse, since I was told specifically not to tell him about this, I will probably be fired ""with cause."" This means not only no paycheck, but probably no unemployment either. I could lose my car, my house and my boyfriend who has patiently stood by my side for the last several years as I finished school and struggled to find a job. I was upfront and honest with him when I got home and now he's not even speaking to me.

All this because I felt bad for the guy. If I do keep my job, I'm just going to keep my head down and pump out work and pray I can hold on for one year and/or until I can find another job.

**TL;DR/Moral of the Story: Empathy doesn't pay the bills, so keep your mouth shut if you want to keep your job.**

**Edit to update** Yep, got fired. Basically, the guy is filed suit against the company today. I was terminated with cause for insubordination.

This is a huge feat and I want to acknowledge your success. I do have a bone to pick with the statement, and it's not a personal slight to you by any means.

I'm getting tired of reading these ""feel good"" motivational poster one-liners. It doesn't do anything for me, and frankly it's starting to get a little offensive. Yes, it's joyous, and there might be some facts behind them; but feeling that way seem to be a luxury that new hires can afford, now that they don't have to trudge through the poverty and kowtow to interviewers anymore. It's a constant reminder that I didn't win the lottery of jobs this week. You can only stay motivated and positive for so long, when you KNOW there's a position that you'll be hired into one day, but no one else is giving a crap about it.

I see that some of us have gone *years* before getting an offer (nowadays that's still not a guarantee!), and I'm approaching that point myself. I feel like an ass every time I work myself up to a frenzy, trying to convince myself that this is the one, then later not hear anything back from them because I probably sneezed in the wrong direction during the interview - and I'm supposed to feel bad about that and work on my interviewing/interpersonal skills for future disappointments.

I was laid off last year, packed up my life from my little Southern town and moved to NYC.

I finally met with a recruiter and within a week of meeting them I've found my first full-time job!! 

I'm feeling such a mixture of emotions right now. I'm so incredibly excited to find a job again. To feel productive again. To have health insurance again (it's amazing how paranoid a 27 year old can be about potentially tripping and breaking an ankle, or having my dog accidentally pop me in the face and break my nose). 

Part of me feels lots of guilt though - I'm not really excited about working. I think it's because I've been out of the loop for so long and I've gotten so used to late late nights and late mornings. Not really having a schedule or things I *have* to do. I'm hoping once I get used to the routine I'll equal out again. I feel incredibly lucky though to finally be able to pull myself out of this hole of equal parts depression and self loathing.

Just a tip for people to keep trying. I have been unemployed for a year this month. I have kept myself up with the support of a girlfriend and various odd jobs repairing vehicles and doing yard work for friends.

I have been responding to ads, signs, suggestions, etc.  I have redone my resume multiple times, I have worked on interview skills.  Between my school schedule, prior experience normally not applicable to a job that fit my school schedule, a shaky job history, tattoos, whatever reasoning they gave, I have been getting turned down for jobs left and right. But I kept trying.

This past week, I went to places that fit my experience or skills, advertising open positions or not. I managed to get an interview on the spot with a manager of a place that was not advertising any open positions after filling out an application. We started as a formal interview, a couple minutes in, we stated talking like old friends. He was blatantly honest, told me what he didn't like about me, but told me what he did as well. We had a long talk and I was told a position wasn't open at this time, but as soon as one was open, I had a place to work. I was told it could be anywhere from a week to months, just depends what happens.

I honestly thought this was just another ""Thanks for trying, good luck out there."" type of comment, but still left maturely and friendly. I got along with him so no reason to let my frustration get in the way.  

2 days passed, then yesterday, I was having a drink and chicken wings on the beach with a couple friends and I got a phone call.  Could barely hear who was on the phone, walked outside, and it was the same manager asking me if I wanted to come to work.

1333570921.0,54,self.jobs,rtgcl,I have a high-paying job in an organization based on lies and fear.  Is this normal?,59,5,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rtgcl/i_have_a_highpaying_job_in_an_organization_based/,"A-hoy-hoy, r/jobs!  This is largely a rant - I'm frustrated to the point of crying because I just can't understand why this is all okay.

I'm deeply distraught about my current job situation, and I would like to know whether this is just the reality of working in industry, or whether I should get my ass out of this particular job.


I work at a biotech company developing a platform for diagnostic assays - vague, I know, but I definitely can't be specific.  My job entails developing assay chemistries to be used on this platform.  It's similar to academic research, but much faster-paced because it tends to be based on pre-existing formulations.  My team is under a ton of pressure from the CEOs to churn out developed chemistries as fast as possible.  There are a good number of criteria and design constraints that must be met for each of them (%CVs must be below X, variability must be less than such-and-such under such-and-such conditions, etc), but they're not so stringent that I would say they're ready for validation.


I'm completely new to industry and chemistry is not my strong suit, so I tend to be partnered with other chemists and we meet with my boss and our team adviser together to discuss results and direction for each project.  I have come to understand that in these meetings, it is recommended to be extremely selective about what you tell the bossmen.  As in, ignoring the bulk of the evidence we've gathered that suggests that the formulation is not working, and instead present the one graph that looks okay and tell them that everything's passing with flying colors.  I have to look them in the eye when my partner says these things and smile and nod.  Once the lie is in place, I then have to back it up with data that is simply unattainable and I get shit from my boss for it.  At this point my boss has lied to the CEOs about the degree of progress made on the project, so now HE'S under pressure to get results out of me.  


This is apparently common practice for everyone here.  We all lie to each others' faces about the ""science"" so that we look better in the short term (it's not science if you're ignoring the data you don't want to see), when in reality we're building a non-functional product.  The CEOs reward those who tell them exactly what they want to hear, and punish (fire) those who bring them problems and suggestions for improvement.  Even supervisors who try to repair the system by holding their employees accountable for their data and give honest information to the CEOs - they do not last long here.  Everything is image-driven because we're all aware we could be fired for not being optimistic enough.  I can think of two people in this entire company who care about the truth behind their work.


I firmly believe this system is going to drive the company into the ground, because the CEOs are training everyone to lie to them.  When they try to implement this product, it's going to fall apart because there's just no accountability.  I can't stand it.  I've stayed in this job about 6 months now because it pays very well, but I'm running out of steam.  I hate chemistry (my degree is in bioengineering), and I hate this company.  I left at noon today because I couldn't keep myself from crying.  Seriously.  I hate lying to people and I hate discrediting myself by pretending I'm okay with it.  I'm afraid of speaking out.  This entire organization is hollow and fear-based.


Is this how all industry jobs are?  If so, I will be looking for a change in careers.  Science should be about seeing reality and using it to make informed decisions and inventions, not about warping it to promote yourself.

**TL;DR: The company I work for rewards those who lie and fires those who are honest.  Is this normal?  ~~Should I leave?~~ I will be quitting as soon as I have another job lined up.**

Edit:  Thanks, guys.  This is my first job, and I was seriously afraid that this was what companies are like everywhere.  I value myself much more than I value these peoples' approval.  I've already submitted resumes to 4 companies in my area since lunch, and I will continue to search until I find an employer who takes their product and their employees seriously.

I'm creating a throwaway account and creating a post - I hope this will help y'all with your job searches.

I'm currently a manager for a company and I'm hiring for another team member. This is a very typical entry-level, 35K administrative position in a large city. This might sound like a job you have applied for! I'm new to the management role and this is only my second time hiring, but I hope this will give you insight as to why I pass on resumes.

1. No relevant experience with no cover letter - I read a resume first. If there is no obvious experience or background, I look for a cover letter to explain why someone wants this position. I'd say &lt; 10% of all applicants submit a cover letter. If no relevant experience and no cover letter, I figure they are throwing resumes in the wind and hoping something will stick. I pass on.

2. 5+ years of experience in any field or education beyond a Bachelors - I understand this is a low-paying position and the #1 reason applicants withdraw their application is because of the pay. If you have a graduate degree and/or are a seasoned applicant, big chance you will not settle for 35K. I move on.

3. Does not live close to the area - just like with reason 2, I've had applicants withdraw their applications because they are not willing to move or commute long distances for a 35K position. If someone mentions in a cover letter that they are looking for positions in my area specifically, it's something I'm willing to consider.


Here are some minor reasons why I've passed on resumes before:

- Typos. Blah! Proofread!

- One guy talked in his cover letter about how he battled alcoholism, lives in poverty and needs a job to take care of his sick mother. It was too much personal information and I felt very uncomfortable after reading that.

- One guy sent in a hardcopy of his resume when the instructions are very clear to apply online. I don't like applicants who ignore instructions... his resume was ignored.

Right now she's applying to local grocery stores. As a medical transcriptionist she was able to work from home and made about $40,000 and year and now I see her looking at minimum wage jobs. Not that there's anything wrong with minimum wage jobs, because I know that's better than some people's situation, but I feel like my mom can do more than that and I just don't know how to help her.

It's 13 pages long so I will post them 1 at a time so that everyone on here can benefit from them. Please feel free to add to this if you found more advice to help people be more successful when interviewing for a job.

**Overview** 


* 70% of a successful interview is enthusiasm, excitement, and energy. 1: Smile 2: Stay positive 3: Use 60-80% eye contact 4: If you don't know what to do with your hands, talk with them 
* 20% of the interview is selling you 
* 10% of the interview is the close. 1: The interview is a sales call and you're the product 2: Ask questions 3: Overcome objections 


**Before the Interview** 

* Dress in a plain navy or dark colored business suit
* Men: White shirt and conservative tie, dark socks, formal, well shined shoes 
* Women: Light colored blouse, conservative pumps (color of suit), light colored stockings 
* Research the company 
* Arrive 10-15 Minutes early before an interview 
* Bring a copy of your resume 
* Prepare a copy of any references 
* Bring a pen and notebooks to take notes before, during, and after the interview
* Prepare questions to ask  during the interview 
* Greet everyone in the office with a smile and hello 
* Fill out all applications neatly and completely
* Greet the interviewer with a smile and by their last name
* Give a firm handshake 
* Psyche yourself up! It's ok to be nervous or a little frightened. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain! 
* Be prepared for the interview because you won't get a second chance to make a first impression

* Don't get too comfortable, remain professional and on guard 
* Don't ever say anything negative and be careful when talking about past and present employers 

**After the interview**

* Jot down notes to help you remember the highlights of the interview (questions, your impressions, your performance). This will help you in future interviews and writing thank you letters

Everyone keeps talking about job creation. But the real problem lies with the jobs that all ready exist. There has been a profound change in the workplaces of the US, an insipidis pervasive change of employee/employer relationship that has made a lot of people feel they are worse off than they were four years ago. But like a frog in a warm pot of water we didn't protest as the temperature got hotter and hotter. We are at boiling point, and have scarcely looked up from our cell phones to notice.
People talk of worker's rights. The real discussion is of respect for workers, creature comforts, fair compensation, and a reasonable workload. Does anyone remember Holiday bonuses? Younger employees sit wide-eyed to hear tales from the seasoned about checks large enough to shop with, and parties where there was food and alcohol. There used to be a time when as a worker announced they were leaving, the employer would immediately begin to find a replacement and, get this, actualy offer that person more money or benefits if they were a valuable member of the team. Now the holidays pass with a buffet line that crosses two time zones. While most employees take a tray back to their cubicle, others chew in sober silence as holiday music spikes anxieties about money during the season. Empty chairs seem to be a theme of this election. But no one is talking about all of the empty chairs on the job. No employer wants to make headlines for mass layoffs, so they use a surgical technique. Pick key positions that are high paying, usually because these personnel foolishly dedicated their lives to the company and have reached the top of the payscale, and simply eliminate them. Another strategy is to hire inexperienced workers into a department then tell seasoned recruits that they can only offer a minimal salary that is ""commensurate"" with the department. It's a buyer's market so the seasoned aquiese to avoid starvation as the practice has become pervasive. At the same time as workers leave, the company strategically drags it's metaphoric feet even posting the position, let alone setting up interviews and actually hiring and training. This process can take six months or more and in the meantime that work is unapologetically divided amongst other workers without compensation, or even acknowledgment of their extra burden. At that point they will eliminate the position all together if the others seem to be handling the burden without gripe. Hhhmm, gripes. Used to be a time when an employee could bargain with the employer to eliminate gripes and restore satisfaction to that employee. Now the axiom is ""Everyone is Replaceable."" All those seminars about management and retention and workplace dynamics are suddenly irrelevant. A whole science of job culture that promotes productivity has died. Productivity is expected. Resistance is futile. If you don't like it, there's the door. And so the masses go through the motions, each muttering to themselves and to each other the sweetest words an employer can hear, ""You're lucky to have a job."" Game over. The world really hasn't changed that much, but the facade has crumbled. The employer doesn't even have to bother to act like they give a crap about anything you think, want, or feel. They look in our face and say they are going broke and must tighten the purse strings for survival while they post record profits and earn fantastic salaries. Who are you going to believe? Them or you lying Nasdaq eyes?
So from what eternal hellspring does this new non-culture of the workplace sloth towrds us? The corporation, of course. It's interesting to note that throughout the RNC, the only time the word corporation was used it was to say that they are people. In the DNC Elizabeth Warren let the word slip out, if she hadn't she may very well have imploded. The corporation, as a person, has been likened to a sociopathic psychopath by psychiatrists examining the goals, motives, and actions of the corporation as a whole. A corportation was once a group of people with a common goal, say to build a bridge, who wanted to venture into a large project while minimizing personal liability. After the single-minded goal was accomplished, the corporation would dissolve or move onto another specific project. Now the reason for existance is the mindless,constant race for more and more profit, growth is the euphamism they use for unapologetic greedocracy. When the goal is to maximize profits, the money turns into filthy lucre as it rolls in over the carcuses of ethics, respect, cooperation, and fairness that are laid to waste in the perfunctory pursuit of the perpetual modern corporation. And the most dejecting and immobilizing reality of today is that we don't seem to mind it.

* Student loan debt in the US tops $1trillion, ensuring most students will remain wage slaves for the majority of their productive years.

* Employers universally complain of a skills shortage when they're actually refusing to hire &amp; train entry level employees, and refuse to pay competitive wages.

* Young people as a group have been hardest hit due to above mention point with employees

* Some say the economy won't fully recover for years, if not decades

* Some employers are finding that they can do more with less by working their remaining employees harder after 
laying off the rest. (Because for the employee it's either ""Work harder for less, or join the unemployment line."") This in turn reduces incentive to hire more people, compounding the problem.

* Older employees are working longer and delaying retirement as they either lost their nest eggs, or are unable to retire for other reasons, further exacerbating the upward mobility problem for everyone else.

* With the glut of applications, the qualifications for just about every job are being raised. Ie. If it took a HS diploma, it now takes a BA. If it took a BA, it now takes an MA, etc... I wouldn't be surprised if I opened the paper to see an entry level job ad for a janitor that requires a BA and 10 years experience.

What I don't hear anyone talking about is the endgame results of the current situation. What is going to happen in 5 years because of this? In 10 years? In 20 years?

I've yet to see anybody put all these things together. I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it myself. The whole thing just sounds like a recipe for utter economic and political disaster. What happens when an entire generation can't get good jobs and are simultaneously wage slaves? What happens to society when you remove all their earning/spending/scientific/creative/productive potential because they're trapped flipping burgers part time just to keep their heads above debt? What happens to all the people who don't have a college education and are unable to get jobs that used to not require said education, but that are now filled by desperate college grads?

The resume critiques, the interview tips, venting of fellow job seekers frustrations, and the overall community really helped me get through this job market.

I had around 70 resume submissions in the past month alone, and one just happened to work out. 4 interviews and one phone call later, I was offered a position at an amazing company with tons of growth opportunity.

Im off to sign the contract but will return in a couple of hours with my job hunting tips. Again, thanks!


**Edit**: So I guess after 6 months of searching, I do have some tips for you guys. These worked for me, but YMMV.



1) Stay in Shape - this has been discussed before, but it really helps you burn off stress. This made a huge difference in my demeanor when I interviewed, and is a topic of conversation during the interview (""Oh, you went on a hike this morning? Where did you go"", etc.). You being poor does not mean you cant go on a run, hike, or a nice walk or swim.

2)  Get into a routine - wake up and make it a habit to apply to at least a couple of jobs a day. It's a way to stay sane.

3) Work your network - Keep your ear to the ground, see if there are openings at companies that your friends work at. Don't come off desperate thought, make sure the job is a right fit for you.

4) Keep LEARNING. - Lynda.com, Wikipedia, TED talks, and youtube are your friends. In my downtime I learned SPSS, SQL, and Spotfire whenever I had some spare time. That's three new skills I got to add to my resume just because I had some free time.

5) Your going to have a ""pity party"" once in a while, and that's OK. Just keep it short and get back to hustling, because getting a job nowadays involves a lot of hustle!

6) You have fairly little control over what job your going to get. Case in point, I got my current offer from a job my girlfriend randomly forwarded me. I almost didn't even apply. Take every opportunity you stumble across, even if you think to yourself ""there is no way I would get this job"".

7) Post your resume on r/resumes. Have redditors rip it apart and rebuild it until you start getting responses from employers. I formatted my resume about 10 different times before the fish started biting.

8) No more ""uhms"" during the interview. It makes you sound unsure of yourself. Take a moment to mull the question over.

9) In an interview, when you are asked a question, don't give your life story! Give an elevator pitch...spend 30-60 seconds answering the question and THAT'S IT. When I get asked a question I spend about 5 seconds making an outline in my brain with 3 bullet points, spoke a little bit about each bullet point, and then explain how they are relevant to the question and tie it in to a central thesis (if applicable). **Don't ramble**. If the interviewer wants to know more, they will ask.

10) Re-read number 9. Yes, its that important.

11) Don't feel guilty for taking a break. Sometimes you've fired off so many resume's you lose count. After about 2 weeks of this it gets debilitating. Go grab some (cheap) beers with friends and vent to them. That's what friends are for! They will listen, and it is therapeutic.

and most importantly...

12) Don't give up.

I'm a recent graduate with a BA in Animation and I've been looking for a job in my field (or anything related) for over 7 months now. All my dreams of finding a job out of college have been slowly destroyed by each rejection email that I have gotten over these months. 


I have applied to close to a hundred jobs now, and the only thing I have going for me at the moment is an unpaid internship at a media firm with no promise of full-time hire when the internship is over.


I have lived by myself, without any income for 5 months now. My boyfriend has been supporting me financially by paying for my rent and buying my food. I don't feel like myself anymore because of this. It's not right to me that he should pay for my rent/ expenses, and it makes me feel 'kept'. I feel like I am immensely in his debt, and that the relationship is not even anymore.


My boyfriend has always supported and encouraged me, but throughout this time he has been saying things that aren't realistic for me (""Oh, don't worry! Somebody will find your art and hire you right away."" or ""You can just open your own animation studio!""). He has never had to look for a job because his family owns food businesses. I feel like he doesn't know the severity of my situation. When I accepted the offer for my current internship position, he didn't take it seriously, joking about how he could just come to work with me and hang out. I understand his view on this unpaid internship (that I feel like I might be overqualified for), but it beats sitting at home every day and doing nothing with my life.


In the end, I feel like I have the right skills and passion to work in my field, but nobody seems to want to give me a chance to prove that.

Last week I was ready to give up.  I still had interviews last week and this week, but I wasn't too hopeful.  

The place I'm going to work for, I interviewed for 7 different positions over the past couple of years.  I was going to stop applying there because even though I would interview there, I wouldn't get the job.  I talked to my friend who works there and he talked to the 2 people interviewing me.  When I went into that interview, it was very friendly and they mentioned my friend a lot.  

I'm good at getting interviews, so here are my tips for the job hunt:

1) Consistent effort is key.  Print out a calendar or make one in Excel.  Every day that you apply or go on interviews, shade it in green.  This lets you see when you are slacking.  

2) Try and see if you know people in the company that can put in a good word for you.  

3) Make a list of companies in your city.  I put them in a spreadsheet and then I would check their websites every week.  This will let you see jobs that don't get posted to Indeed.com. 

4) Speed is key.  The fresher the job posting the better.  I wouldn't bother with postings more than 2 weeks old. 

5) Put your resume on Monster and Careerbuilder.  I got contacted from some recruiters through there.  2 got me temporary positions and 1 got me another offer. 

6) Have some type of routine that gets you out of the house.  I have 2 group gym classes on Tuesday and Friday.  I would lift weights on Wednesday and Saturday.  This gave me something to look forward to every week.  

7) Eye contact during the interview.  If you are shy or have bad eye contact, make an effort to make more eye contact than you normally would. 

8) Make the interviewers like you.  This occurred to me halfway through the search.  The other people interviewing should have the technical skills, what will set you apart will be your ability to get the interviewer to like you. 

9) The job you are interviewing is the one you want.  When they ask about your ideal job or where you see yourself in 5 years, don't mention something totally unrelated to the position you are interviewing for.

After a depression of 4 years, things finally seem to get a little better. I haven't worked for more than 3 years now. Never applied for a job. I was just too messed up. Stayed at home the whole time, avoiding human contact. The worst thing is, nobody knows that I'm depressed. All they know is that I haven't got a job since 2009.

I still feel like crap, but at least I'm taking action now. I came to realize that nothing will change if I don't take action. It was a long pity party, but I'm tired of it now. 

The only problem I'm facing now is, what do I tell my future employer? Tell him that I've been depressed for 4 years or lie and tell that I worked somewhere?

Any ideas?

Now that I'm in law school, I don't want to be a lawyer.",59,7,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/s07xo/always_wanted_to_be_a_lawyer_now_that_im_in_law/,"I honestly have no idea if this is the proper subreddit for a question like this, so if I'm in the wrong place, I apologize. Anyway, on to my issue:

Ever since I was probably in the 7th or 8th grade, I've wanted to go to law school and be a lawyer. I never wavered in this desire. I went to college straight out of high school and got my degree in Business Administration, because I was pretty sure I wanted to go into corporate/transactional law and because it was a good catch-all degree. I thought about maybe taking a year off after getting my degree, but I had accumulated several student loans that I could only continue to defer if I went straight into law school, so I did just that.

I'm now almost done with my first year of law school and I've come to the realization that I don't have what it takes to even finish getting through law school, much less be an actual attorney. I won't go into crazy detail about what made me realize this, but suffice it to say that law school and being an attorney takes a level of commitment and hours that I just don't have. I didn't study hard enough or pay close enough attention in class my first semester and subsequently got only average grades which put me just below the 50% mark in class rankings, and it's looking like this semester will likely be a repeat of that.

So, knowing this, I think I've determined that law school is not for me. But the problem is, I have absolutely no back up plan. Being a lawyer is all I've wanted to do since middle school, so I never planned any sort of contingency. I have a degree in Business, but I honestly don't feel like I know anything about it. I feel like that degree didn't really give me any useable skills.

So, reddit, what do I do? I'm completely at a loss and am kind of freaking out, because not only am I 23 and have no idea what to do with my life, I also have a rather large amount of student loan debt racked up between 4 years of undergrad and a year of law school. The only thing I've ever even considered as a back-of-my-mind-day-dream other than law school was doing voice acting, specifically for video games. However, after doing some quick research, that is apparently an incredibly hard industry to break into and, outside of some heavy involvement in the theater program when I was in high school 5 years ago, I have no training or experience in it whatsoever.

So, reddit, any advice you can give me at all would be much appreciated. Feel free to ask any clarifying and/or follow-up questions.

I've done all the mock interview nonsense and I always score high, my career services (one of the best in the US apparently) doesn't know whats wrong with me.  I've had actual companies mock interview me as well, and they've always said that I did a good job.

My resume is great, I have references, I have alot of extracurriculars in college, and I have awards and honors as well.  I was also active in volunteering in my time unemployed.  

I just don't get why I'm not hired, whenever I ask they say that someone else was a better fit.  I do all this stuff where people analyze me and they say I'm good, yet when I deliver the same thing to the actual hiring people I get a no.  

I'm not terrible to where they turn me down off the bat, I've gotten to a few final rounds where I get brought out to headquarters.  

I've had close friends give me an analysis, and they think that it may have something to do with having a non traditional name that may be kind of funny.  

That and I hate all the fake BS and sometimes it shows.  I admit that I have a very short patience when I recognize that someone is trying to get me to jump through hoops and do the old song and dance.   But I still do my best to upkeep it.  

I'm not someone who is unlikeable though, I can make friends fast and I was popular in high school and pretty known in college.  Every group interview I have, I end up becoming friends with fellow interviewees, who end up keeping in touch with me and I do use them in my network.  

**TL;DR:**  So my question would be, when you go to career services and they say your resume and interviewing is great, and then you mock interview with actual employers and they tell you that you did a good job.  Yet, when you go to the actual interview they tell you no...

what can you do?  

That and before I was getting interviews left and right, like 4 or so a month.....  now they're increasingly harder to come by

The worst part is seeing others who have jobs, not making myself out to be conceited, but **I feel that I deserve a job over some of the people that these companies hired.**  One of the girls that got hired over me is not smart at all, just really good at being dumb and bubbly.  Which would be fine if it was retail or something, not a number crunching finance position.  And no, that is not a generalization that she's dumb and manipulative **SHE AND HER GROUP WERE CAUGHT PLAGIARIZING** off of my roommates final project.  The school let her slide with just an F on the project, and she gets hired over both me and my roommate.....  Why the fuck would companies hire people that are crooks like that and leave the rest of us hanging high and dry.  

On a side note, both I and my old roommate aren't weird or anything at all.  I dress very well in name brand clothing, carry myself well, have good grades, active socially not just within my own group but through clubs and frats and stuff too.  So its not like I'm some smelly socially inept kid that walks into an interview with an oversized suit I bought from JCPenney the day before.  Although since graduating, I've become less social and more pissed and bitter everyday.

I am a frigging wreck mentally, I haven't dated anyone in years, I'm almost 40 and I have nothing in my life to show for how fucking hard I've worked to just survived.

I have a hearing disability and had to bust my ass to be the only one in my family to get a college degree ON AN ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIP.  While my parents paid for houses and cars for my little brother, I have been absolutely clawing my way to some sort of life.

I've had enough of this.  I got laid off yet again Thursday, the company shut down and is selling all its assets.  I'm not even surprised anymore.  I have no safety net, no one who gives one iota of a shit about me (it's true what they say about fairweather friends...when I was doing great financially everyone wanted to be mine, now they've disappeared).  

I'm tired of calling and interviewing and kissing ass and pretending like I know where I want to be in five years when all I want IS TO BE FUCKING EMPLOYED.  I worked so effing hard to get an engineering degree by sheer brute force, helping others along with their careers and lives and FUCKING NO ONE bothers to try helping me.  If anything, I deal with nasty backstabbing coworkers who will happily throw me under the bus if they have a chance...and then twist the knife as I try applying for other companies only to hear they said some nasty shit about me WHEN I NEVER PUT THEM DOWN AS A REFERENCE.  WHO DOES THAT????

I have never said anything bad about anyone I've worked with to anyone, even though I have been sexually harassed (I'm a guy), verbally sworn at loudly in a work environment, threatened with legal action if I didn't take a 2/3rds paycut with NO HEALTH BENEFITS.  

I kiss peoples' assses, I easily get through resume review and phone screen, but when I show up in the office, a 40 year old with hearing aids, people immediately glaze over.  Nobody takes me seriously even though I could work fucking miracles if needed.  Seriously...one company hired me and immediately told me they had NO funds to pay for the projects they hired me for.  SO I WENT OUT AND FOUND THEM.  AND found a dev company to do the fucking work.  AND managed every single element of the product with NO support from senior management.  Seriously, my VP Product NEVER EVEN HAD INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE, and he's the one who continues to find work while I struggle to survive.  

I am tired of beating beat up and chewed out.  I'm buying a fuckin gun this week.  I've had it.  ",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_1f2fg8,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1f2fg8/ive_had_enough/,

Now I'm rethinking things, I starting looking for the company, and there's almost no information on them, no online rep whatsoever, a few scattered almost empty linkedIn profiles and their free-template like homepage.

I was thinking on calling directly to their offices, to see if someone answers, yes I've been thinking their an hoax company, but then again (yes the idea has crossed my mind, if your a crook, you can have false offices and all.  An ex employer whom I asked for help told me he verified that their paying their taxes, but also said that it might be an elaborated hoax.

That is the worst case scenario, the more realistic one, is that they're an exploitative company, I've heard terrifying stories about tech companies that hire Mexican developers, and do not comply with the contracts, stop paying your salary if get out of project, there are pretty worrying clauses in the contract specially one that says that they will sue you by 20k if you get fired or not work for them for 24 continuous months, to pay for their expenses.

In all, I want to ask for a way to verify the companies legitimacy, in turn my fears are true, I want to see if I can get out of the contract without getting sued and without affecting my tourist visa (I don't care about the NAFTA work visa) and further 'processes' with the US immigration/government.

One of the first things in the contract said something about starting being valid once the employee reports to work. 

Thanks for any help, if I need to add more info please ask, but I cannot disclose too much, you understand. 



UPDATE 1:

Yesterday happened a very disgusting thing, they called after a week without contact to tell me I had an interview with a client of them. To which I reluctantly agreed, it was just a few hours before the interview, but 5 minutes before the it they called me again, and said that they sent me an email, it was a highly modified resume of mine, with a lot of lies, on my experience, tools and such, the worst part was that they modified two of my former jobs completely, from one language to another, a complete distinct tool set.

They even asked me to lie and say that I was already in the US for a month, and that my visa got approved for 2 years instead of two. I was shocked, they asked me if I agreed, to which I say nothing out of disgust.

I took the interview, but did not lie, I recorded the whole thing. I have a second interview next week. I told this to the recruitment agency in Mexico that put me in contact with them, they arranged a meeting between them, me and the company. I gues I'll tell them there I don't want to go with them, see how they react, if they thread me or if they agree to release me without fight because they realize their 'contract' is weak if we go to court.

I just want to be sure that they can't do me anything legally, and that I won't get in trouble with the US govt because I got a work visa and never actually worked there (of course I wont use it for anything, not even border crossing) 


UPDATE2:

This is the dreaded clause I was telling you about:

Liquidated Damages Prospective Contractor acknowledges that Company, in its attempts to locate and secure projects with its clients for Prospective Contractor to perform, will be forced to expend extensive time, effort and resources. Should Company make an offer to Prospective Contractor to execute an Employment Agreement (defined below) during the Term of this Agreement, and Prospective Contractor refuses, or is unable to execute the Employment Agreement due to other employment obligations or its inability to legally work in the United States,Company shall be entitled to liquidated damages in the sum of $20,000.00, which represents Company’s best estimate of the fees it would have otherwise received from its Client if Prospective Contractor performed his obligations under the offered Employment Agreement.

I actually had my two weeks notice with me and was planning on handing it in, but a situation occurred where I just said enough was enough.

In the past 3 months we have lost so many employees that the amount of overtime was ridiculous.  I'm in the health care field and we have mandatory forced overtime.  

In the past 3 months I've had around 20 forced shifts.  

Around twice a week I was being forced to work from 10pm to 5pm the following afternoon and then expected to come back again at 10pm and work until 9am.  

I was burnt out, exhausted, and the company has shown no concern for anyone, refusing to hire more staff.  The most recent schedule has over 50 shifts OPEN in the next two weeks and we have barely 60 staff all together (who are of course already working their own normal shifts).  

Monday morning I was told I was being forced again and I just lost it, told them they're going to have to force someone else because I quit and then walked out.

That's probably more information than needed to answer my main question, but I needed to vent.

So I gave them my two weeks notice on may 4th. My last day was may 18th. 

My paychecks are issued twice a month, on the 5th and the 20th. 

My paycheck on may 5th was not only a week late, (actually the 12th), but they had removed **20 hours of overtime**. I have a photograph on my phone of the time sheet (with the overtime) with the signature of the owner. They said they ""could not afford to pay me the overtime"" at that moment, but ""had every *intention* of paying me"" what was owed. 

The paycheck that was supposed to be issued on the 20th has not been issued yet. I have contacted them multiple times on email and phone records. They say they ""are doing everything in [our] power to get you the money""

I have 3 days worth of pay that will supposedly be on the June 5th paycheck. 

The people running this business are idiots. They have done nearly everything wrong I can think to do (why I left) and I KNOW they LIE to employees to smooth things over and keep them working. I KNOW they owe money all over town as well. I also KNOW that they are indeed **broke**. So the thing about not being able to afford paying my overtime at that moment was probably true. 

However, that's not my problem. It is their responsibility to pay me what they owe me in a timely manner. I **need** this money. $1,500 may not be a lot to some of you, but it is to me. That's like a months pay in my income bracket. 

So how long should I wait before taking this to court? I can't wait that long, but I also don't want to come off as a total asshole trying to ruin them. When should I go to small claims court? How does that process go? Do I need an attorney or do I just speak with a clerk? Obviously if the cost of taking them to court outweighs the money owed, it wouldn't make sense. What should I do?

Edit: a word

Edit: **UPDATE**
I called the Washington state department of labor and industries! They said I can submit a formal complaint as early as the day after I was supposed to be paid. Since I have a few hours on a pay check that is due on the 5th of June, I will submit my complaint the following day in order to make sure all the money they owe me is on one form. 

With my complaint they encouraged me to send copies of my pay stubs, emails between myself and the owner, as well as the photographs of my time sheets. (I have all of this)

They said that my (previous) employer will have 60 days to respond to the complaint. If they have not paid me before that time has elapsed, legal and financial penalties will occur. 

Justice will be done!

Edit: **Update 2**

Email to former bosses:

Dear buttfuck1 and buttfuck2,

This email is to inform you that one week from today, on June 6th 2013, I will be mailing a Worker Rights Complaint Form #F700-148-000 to the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries for my missing wages. 

This form will highlight the 18 hours of overtime ($326) removed from the check issued on May 5th, the missing check for 78.5 hours ($942) that should have been issued on May 20th, as well as my final check for 18 hours ($216) that is due on June 5th. (All of these totals are before taxes)

I hope to hear from you soon.

But most companies don't even respond to my applications. Most of them I've been just applying through the internet. I customize each resume, each cover letter, have people proofread my entire application, and nothing. 

I've attended a bunch of networking events in my industry to meet people and advertised career fairs. People are very nice but it never seems to go anywhere.

I've tried randomly messaging people on linkedin for informational interviews and nobody will respond. That seemed like a dead-end route.

I've tried searching through my school's job boards but again, nothing comes through. Most companies still don't respond. 

I've told all my friends and almost everyone I know (even those NOT in my field). At this point everyone and their grandma knows I'm looking for a job.

It's been exhausting but so revitalizing! Here are the details:

I started my job search on June 15th, a month after I graduated with a BA. I packed up everything I owned and moved into a cheap subleased apartment on the south side of Chicago, about 4 hours from home. I sent out anywhere from 1 to 4 résumés a day for about a month. However, I can effectively negate the first two weeks of searching because I was using a pretty bad résumé. I was looking for jobs that held steady 9-5 hours so I could continue to pursue my creative endeavors in the evening and not have to worry about wonky scheduling conflicts. Because I had experience as an admin assistant, those were the sorts of jobs for which I was applying. I was using Indeed and Craigslist exclusively.

On July 15th, panic started to set in. I had received zero responses, positive or negative, and I knew I didn't have a lot of money to kick around. I started learning about temp agencies, so I gave them an application. I applied to 3 staffing agencies, which I found through Yelp. One agency never contacted me, and 2 set up interviews. The first interview went okay, but subsequent interactions with the agency (in addition to a lack of work) drove me to stop contacting them. I'm not sure exactly what happened, but when I stopped reporting my availability they just sorta let me drop off without another word.

The second agency, though, was a real gem. My recruiter is an absolute doll and really helped me out. She started me off with some super-short (1-3 day) assignments. They weren't glamorous but they put some money in my pocket and they actually helped me to learn more about the huge companies I had been applying to.

August came and went and I was still doing some short assignments with my recruiter, but they came with regularity so I could count on at least having them money to pay the bills. Finally, she got me an interview with a company that she thought would be a good fit for me. She was right. We did a phone interview, the owner and I, on the first of September, and by the following Friday I had been hired on as a data entry and admin support position. The company is exactly what I wanted - small, flexible, nice, and progressive. My first week of work was like a dream come true!

I had one other interview, which actually happened the day before I got hired. It was an interview with the company of the only contact I had in Chicago - so YES, contacts work. The fact that the interviewer could only describe the job as ""hectic with minimal support"", however, only made me want the first job more. Lucky me, I think I tanked the second interview (possibly on purpose) and got offered the first job.

I'm so far past cloud nine right now, I can't even believe it. I found a new apartment and the pieces of my life seem to have fallen into place. The job is temp-to-hire, so you better believe I'm working my ass off to impress.

If I can answer anyone's questions, feel free to fire away!

Wouldn't it be helpful to know what you would actually be doing in a given job?

When I was in college I was completely lost and did not know what to expect in my post college career. I majored in computer science but I had no idea what my job would entail on a daily basis. It turned out to be quite different from my expectations. I believe a lot of people are in the same boat. 

I have an idea for a website that will showcase daily activities for a variety of professions. For example, how much time does an architect spend actually design buildings vs doing paper work, getting permits, picking out lightbulbs, etc. If you're interested in the design part of architecture but then found out that most of the time you're actually doing paperwork, then you might think twice about pursuing this path.

I have created a quick sample page of what kind of information the site will provide. Here it is:

[http://jobsamplepage.simplelander.com/](http://jobsamplepage.simplelander.com/)

Please do not pay attention to aesthetics, just the type of content. I literally put this together in 2 hours. I'm looking for feedback on whether people are interested in this type of thing and what kind of information they want to see.

Here's what I learned, even after doing this many times before...

- Keep your resume active on search sites. Recruiters generally search for ""new resumes today"", so edit your resumes *every morning*
- Don't craft a resume and stop. This was my big mistake. If you're not getting calls, keep editing it. Do massive rewrites, change the layout, change the length. Change the amount of detail. Try resumes targeted towards different jobs (sales, writing code, DBA, etc)
- Try different things in your resume. Remember when your resume coach or whoever said ""keep it professional""? Fuck that. Just for the hell of it I changed my resume to a one-pager with pictures of the covers of my books. That got me a **ton** of phone calls from recruiters who would then say ""your resume doesn't say a lot about your experience - do you have a more detailed one?"" 
- Try everything. If the phone's not ringing, you can't do worse. 
- When recruiters do call, seek feedback on your resume. Don't argue - just make the changes they suggest. 
- Apply for every job you can find. I ended up with about a dozen resumes for different jobs and different perspectives. Sometimes I just chose one at random to send in. 
- Always write a cover letter. If there's not much of a job description, just describe yourself and what kind of job you're looking for.
- Be honest. If you have a disqualifying factor for some jobs, tell the recruiter up front. Once you've engaged them, if you're up front about stuff, they're more likely to go shuffle through their files for you. 
- If you're a fast learner, don't be afraid to cram the night before on something. Also, if it's a phone screen, keep a window to Google open - you never know when just a glance at a word the interviewer is using is enough to knock something loose.

Also, recruiters have told me the job market is starting to open up, albeit slowly.

Upon observation, current employees/job-fillers are playing this card to effectively shut down conversations to new grads and job-seekers. Rather than explaining the process behind what makes an environment and procedure part of the ""real world"", it's said with arrogance to put people down. (As a side note, this is also used in discussions where one person assumes the other knows nothing about the field, and do not want to disseminate the differences in opinions.)

I don't like to bring my personal opinions into things, but I'm doing so to draw a point. I get that sometimes what students learn in the classroom will not pan out, outside of the campus. I'm also not saying that events which happen in the field are invaluable and not worth examining. But, there really is a disturbing trend with job-fillers dominating the field with whatever practice they want, then say people won't really get it, or need to step in line, because it's just ""the real world"".

Often, ""the real world"" actually mirrors classroom vignettes, only with unforeseen circumstances. If your project is being stymied because your fiscal calender and the one of your sponsors start at different dates, effectively conflicting the funding allocation, THAT'S a real world situation. If you don't make your projected quota this month, because it's the flu season, and many of your employees have succumbed to catching colds, THAT is a real world situation - something that is out of a group's control, no matter how well the preventative protocols have been established.

It is **NOT**, ""Oh, I'm suddenly going to decide to base my hiring decision on the color of your suit, or how you eat in front of me."" Nor is it ""I don't *feel* that personality assessments are worth my time and money, so I'm not going to use it based on that opinion"". The real world is not based on job-fillers narrow world-view and personal feelings. These are things that can be replaced by doing research or just going to conferences to sit and listen. To tell others to step in line based on things with no factual backing, at such an arrogant level, is actually called ""being a bully"", or ""a lazy dick. 

This forum is designed to bring in a variety of viewpoints to have a healthy discourse, to equip the readers with the capabilities to have a fair set of knowledge to make their own decisions. So, let's stop just throwing words around or have preconceived notions just because job-fillers have made their own set of rules from thin air.

1306651521.0,50,self.jobs,hmpb6,How hiring works - Resumes,56,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hmpb6/how_hiring_works_resumes/,"I think there is not enough information out there on how hiring works.  It seems like most of the information available is from a recruiters point of view.   My experience is as a hiring manager, my goal is to create great teams and see people succeed.  Here is my small effort to give you some insight into the process.  This is such a complicated process I am starting off with how your resume is reviewed.

My point of view is for jobs in a professional setting, generally in the technology industry.  It is not that different outside of my small world, but each company and industry is unique.

This is still a simplified view of the process, I'm leaving a number of people out that may be involved in the process.

Job Req - One way or another a manager has a job opening.  This might be a new position or an opening due to an employee leaving the team for any reason.  The best are due to internal job transfers and new positions.  Part of my job as a hiring manager is to not lose the job req.  In larger companies sometimes not filling the position fast enough will mean losing the position.  This is where temps and contractors are helpful when needed.  ""Try before you buy""...

Job Description - Someone creates a description of the job and the required duties.  This is usually done by the hiring manager.  At this point, the exact role is rarely 100% defined, unless it is in a team with high turnover.  This is also when the job is explained to recruiters and agencies.

Resume Collection - Resumes come into recruiters via postings, referrals, and agencies (sometimes).  The recruiters review resume's and forward the ones they think meet the requirements to another group of recruiters, or sometimes the hiring manager.  Some recruiters will collect a number of resumes and send them all at once, and some send them in as they come in.  Recruiters only want to forward on qualified resumes.  They look for keywords, experience at similar companies with similar titles, and any other guidance they have been given.  The recruiters work really hard to only forward resumes that are at least close to being a good fit.  

This is the first stage of why it is SO important to explain how YOU can do the job that was posted.  Recruiters do not care if their name was on the cover letter.  They want to know the hiring manager won't complain that the resumes they receive are crap.

[Agencies] - Here is my small pitch for Agencies.  If an agency has a history of success with a company, the resumes they submit tend to get forwarded quickly with minimal review.  They are also often presented in a way that the hiring manager prefers.  Good agencies ALWAYS explain why you are right for this role.  Usually they either replace your objective, or just provide a decent cover letter.  They may make minor formatting changes to your resume.

Hiring manager resume review - [me] Depending on what is going on resumes are reviewed as they come in or in batches.  Out of everyone in the process I have the most leeway to determine what happens next and how fast it happens.  My only goal in reviewing resumes is to determine if you have the potential to do the job I have available.  Depending on the role, the hiring manager may see a couple resumes a week to dozens.  

The review process of resumes can last anywhere between a few seconds to a couple minutes.  There is a rhythm developed after reviewing a few thousand resumes.  Staying with the industry standards for the format will only benefit you.

With enough experience the hiring manager will know what resumes are worth following up on.  It's very hard to explain, but certain resumes click and you know this is the person to follow up with.  These are usually resumes that either show similar experience, or the candidate has explained why they can do the job as posted.  The odd thing is that even with a bad resume, it is easy to see that you might be a good fit.  I am not hiring for someone who is good at writing resumes  (usually).  

Just keep in mind, my job is to build a team that can meet our business goals.  I've already done the time and I am not worried about how you introduce yourself to me.   I've seen every version of you are a team oriented professional looking to contribute that you can imagine.  I'm usually not that interested in the personality traits you think you have.  

I know that to build a good team, YOU need to be able to do most of the responsibilities in the job description, and *I* need to make sure I can keep you challenged and help you reach your ultimate career goals.  Your job in the resume is to convince me that you can deliver.  This is done by demonstrating your  experience and expressing your interest in the job I have posted.

I've tried retooling my resume several times, calling recruiters, coaxing my connections, cold calling, you name it...i'm still stuck without a job. 

Where i stand now, and what i've learned: 

1. Have had 3 interviews, none from any biopharma companies. First was a non-profit charity (which i got because of connections, and wasn't even the suitable candidate for), the second was a market research corporation (which i, my mistake, wasn't entirely prepared for - i've never written a business case before - but again, my mistake) and a third for a food corporation (and i'm waiting to hear back from them). 


2. All the other bio-tech places i've applied to have either not gotten back to me or are STILL (read, 3 months after applying) reviewing my application.

3. Job opportunities in Toronto especially in biotech are the absolute dismal worst. 

4. Trying to get a job elsewhere in the country or elsewhere in the continent is stupidly hard unless you physically move there ... which is even harder to do if you don't have money. 

5. Wanted to share with you a statistic: for one job i applied to, there were 300 resume's sent to the HR, out of which 15 were sent for interview, for one position. 

I need help, and advice on what to do next. I thought that if i could get something in biotech/industry, it would replace the necessity to do a PhD. Now, it seems i'll have to do a PhD, and will have wasted a year of my life doing nothing.

/r/jobs, any advice? 


EDIT: BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE i just REALLY want to thank /r/jobs for all the advice thus far. From interview advice, to resume advice, and everything in between. I honestly don't think i would have even gotten a single interview had it not have been for you guys/gals.

I hope everyone who is still seeking for their next challenge keeps their chins up and knows that they'll get there soon!

I've also relocated both internationally and then within the country for this job, so I have experience in both these aspects of job hunting.  I wanted to share my experiences with the fine folk of reddit who have helped me in various stages of this process, in the hope that my advice could possibly help others find success.  Here's my most important tips for job hunting (tailored especially to people looking for relocation opportunities)

* ***Catalogue your activities***

During my job search, I applied for 174 jobs in total.  I know this because every time I applied for a job, I would write in a speadsheet detailing the following for each job:

- *Date of application*
- *Company*
- *Position applied for*
- *Industry Sector*
- *Location City*
- *Location State*
- *Method of Application (e.g. Linkedin/Email/Monster/Etc)*
- *Did I save a custom cover letter? (Yes/No)*
- *Contact Name of Hiring Manager/HR*
- *Any other Notes on Job*

This cataloguing of the jobs ensured that I could look back each day and each week to see if I was hitting my metrics in job applications.  Generally I'd aim for 6 - 8 *GOOD* job applications each day. I'll get into what I would classify as a *GOOD* job application shortly.  The process takes about 2 minutes per job, but is very useful.  If I hear back positively or negatively following an application I also catalogue this on the spreadsheet (by highlighting the row red or green &amp; updating my comments).



* ***Location Specific Resumes***

This is a tricky area.  If you're looking for a job local to the city you're in, no problem.  Use your address on your resume so they know that you're local to the area.

When I got to the US (and before I arrived), I had the challenge that I was ready to relocate throughout the country at short notice.  Making employers aware that I was *really* available to relocate quickly was difficult.  I had one HR manager tell me that they have countless numbers of applicants who they will interview that state they are ""ready to relocate"" that then renege on this when they consider the challenges in actually upheaving their life and moving across country.  My best attempt to counter this was the following:

Make Resumes for the 5 places you'd like to live the most.  Use friend's addresses or random places off 
google maps (if you're anxious about using someone's address look up a house for rent on trulia and use that instead.  Then make a blank one (no address) for places that fall outside of your target cities.  Use the appropriate resume and in your cover letter, address the locality if it feels right (e.g. ""I love the city of _____ and I am looking forward to continuing my career here""). If questioned in interview about your location, say you used a friends address and give a definitive date that you're looking to be available for work at that location.

If locations were not within the 5 cities picked, use the blank resume and make sure that you have ""READY TO RELOCATE"" somewhere on the resume, and also that you write it after your address on any online forms you fill out for the job application.


* ***Custom Cover Letters***

I got this down to a fine art by the end of my application process!  Every job that I applied for, I endeavoured to write a custom cover letter addressing my candidacy for that role.  What I found is that after time, I had built up a set of cover letters that pretty much covered all the variants of jobs I was applying for.  These could be tweaked and occasionally chopped together to create a good cover letter for most roles. Every once in a while I also threw in a complete oddball one to try and shake things up (e.g. be very casual with the cover letter, or tongue in cheek with it).


* ***Unique Resume + Online Profile***


With the prevalence of internet applications, there are hundreds, or thousands of applicants for each role.  

//**EDIT 1 **: One of the early things I discovered in this process is that different employers have different requirements, and some will find it easier to work with a .txt based resume, while others will want a slick .pdf or nicely formatted word document for visual emphasis.  Creating a version of my resume in notepad that I could quickly copy pasta content from when prompted in online application forms was a great time saver.  Sometimes, the employer also asks for a .txt version or word version of the resume.  I'm an Adobe InDesign guy, so my resume was done in InDesign and then .pdf'ed, but I maintained a .txt and also a word version that I could use if they didn't accept my .pdf   Also, make sure to keep under 500kb because for some reason they mostly didn't allow attachments any larger.//

Anything you can do to set yourself apart is vitally important. I have had two recruiters tell me that ""my resume was just so different they couldn't stop coming back to it"". I had used interesting fonts and some graphical design elements that were non-standard, and this helped me to stand out enough for them to contact me directly. Additionally, I had about 3 people critique my resume and tailored it based on their recommendations.  Wording is very important in resumes, and using the right keywords can make a big difference.


One easy tip here also is to buy a domain of your last name (if its unique) or something relevant to yourself but professional, and then use google apps to setup an email address at this domain.  Its pretty simple to do and there's online guides. For about $5 a year, this recently introduced service by google is a great way to stand out from the pack (and you can still use the gmail interface with the name).

Personally, I also made a website displaying some of my portfolio work (I'm in marketing and did a bit of practical design work on brochures etc).


 PM me if you'd like linking to my resume and I'll happily do so.


* ***Multiple Touch Points***

This is a KEY factor to getting somewhere with your job search.

Sites such as Linkedin allow you to often identify who the HR manager and the Hiring Manager are in any particular company.  Sending them a note to say hello and introduced yourself is a very good way to stand out from the pack. My success rate with Linkedin ""inmails"" is probably 25% responses, which is not great, but  that is a lot better than response rate from sending resume + cover letter alone! 

Consider paying the $20 a month for premium on linkedin because you can send up to 5 InMails a month (might be 10 actually?), and also it shows salary estimates for positions, which can be very useful if you're searching in multiple states where salaries for the same role fluctuate greatly.  For these reasons, I always looked on LinkedIn with preference when job searching as my primary site. After exhausting linkedin each day, I'd generally troll Indeed's huge number of added jobs (as they amalgamate a lot of sites).  I would also occasionally check through all the industry company's in my target sector (this is longwinded and boring but can pull up jobs fewer people have applied for because for whatever reason they fell between the cracks) 

If you can figure out their email format, even better.  (most companies use something like firstname.lastname@company.com), of even if they don't, they'll probably have redirects that work with this naming convention. Check the email contact of a press release article by the company and use this naming convention when you ID the hiring manager and/or HR manager!



* ***Networking IRL***

I've seen a few posts on here from people saying that you should tell EVERYONE YOU KNOW that you're looking for a job.  While this might not be a bad idea, especially for certain types of job, if you're looking for a manager role or above, you're going to have to get by on your merits a bit more.

If you can afford it or live close to a city where they take place, GO TO TRADE SHOWS.  Go to a trade show and show an interest and/or experience in that industry's products and services.  Talk to people, if the conversation develops, then let them know you're shopping around for a job in that industry.  Its amazing how many nice people you can meet at trade shows, and people are much more receptive there than anywhere else.  For some of the very large companies, this can be one of the only ways of really getting a foot in the door.

If you work in a specific industry and apply for a job, knowing there'll be a trade show soon that you can visit, offer to meet the hiring manager there! It shows initiative, interest in the industry, and convenience for the manager because they'll already be at the event.

Another piece of advice here is bring business cards + examples of work.  Resumes get lost and forgotten at trade shows because they don't fit in a pocket with the wad of other cards.  If you think your resume will get kept by the guy... it may do, but it probably wont!

After meeting someone at a trade show, ensure that the next point of contact is down to YOU.  They will have 2-3 days of meeting hundreds of people, you may fade to the background of their consciousness.  If you make sure to email them or call them the following week referencing your discussion and proposed next steps, this will bring the meeting back into their mind quickly.



=======================


That's about all I can think of at the moment. I know this is a bit long, but I hope it is at least somewhat helpful to people still searching.

I'm 45 years old, and I live in hell.  

I dropped out of college after three years.  The Engineering program was too tough for me, and heavy partying finished me off.

I got a job in a sign-making shop at the college, doing general labor and supervising student employees.  

In the late 1980's, the shop got its first PC.  I taught myself how to program, and soon became the in-house tech guy for the shop.

After awhile other shops started coming to me for their tech needs, and eventually my position was expanded to cover several shops.  I continued in this mode until a few years ago, when our college (which is on the small side) finally got serious about providing centralized campus-wide tech support.  They hired an IT manager from the corporate world, and all the little guys like me were transferred to a large support team under his direction.  

With this centralization came specialization.  Before the change, I was managing servers, writing code, providing end-user support.  After, all I did was write code.

Our new manager aggressively started hiring top-notch talent.  Experienced systems programmers from big-name tech firms with well-regarded, widely-known (in the field) achievements.  Young whiz-kids with PhD's whose entire daily lives revolved around computer science and programming.

So now, our department consists eight world-class programmers - and me, the college drop-out within spitting distance of fifty years old.  Everyone knows that I'm not up to standard, and though by and large this fact isn't mentioned, it's made plain in other ways.

We have two department meetings a week: Monday mornings to plan the week and Thursday afternoons to report our progress.  Each meeting is a new slice of hell, as my progress amounts to a fraction of anyone else's in the department.  Often, I report little or no progress, since I've been working on modifying a particularly tricky bit of code of one of the other guys.  The guys are generally a well-heeled polite bunch but I can see the subtle expression changes and uncomfortable tension in the room, a veiled mixture of pity and distaste.

This feeling of professional inadequacy plagues me every day.  Some days, knowing that the effort will be extreme and the results miniscule, I'm unable to work at all and accomplish literally nothing.  Monday through Thursday is a staircase of escalating despair as the progress meeting gets closer.  The bottom drops out, and then Friday through Sunday escalates similarly as another week in hell approaches.

The environment at my college is pretty forgiving, and so I haven't lost my job, yet.  Still, they could give me the axe at any time, and I wait for it to fall. I know that I don't belong there, and I have thought about - even fantasized - about changing my career, or at least taking another job more in line with my capabilities.  But Fear and Rationalization keep me there.

Each day I live with this oppressive undercurrent of inadequacy and dread of my workplace, but objectively I know that I'm fortunate to have a well-paying job with benefits.  I desire to be free of this coward's life, but rationalize it by treating my work purely as a money-maximization endeavor.  I forsake satisfaction and respect from my peers for the money, which I mostly save in anticipation of the axe, which could (and by rights should) come at any time.

Although I have hinted at my situation with my one or two friends/acquaintances and family, they are forced to conclude I've kept my job through *some* degree of merit.  But, when axe day does come, their intuitions will be confirmed, and my already questionable esteem in their eyes with fall even further.

My more impulsive thoughts welcome the axe.  Losing my job would turn the page and provide some hope for personal redemption and fulfillment in my remaining years, without having to overcome my defensive reflexes which assure me that I will have made ""a terrible mistake"" if I were to pull the trigger myself.



**tl;dr**: Trapped by money and fear in a job I don't deserve, destroying my soul.

1329473762.0,45,self.jobs,ptq0a,Just got a job offer today. Want to share what I did.,56,11,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ptq0a/just_got_a_job_offer_today_want_to_share_what_i/,"I've been lurking r/jobs for a while, gleaning tips here and there for use during my job hunt. I received and accepted an offer for a GREAT job today, and wanted to share with you the steps that I took to get to this point. Maybe they'll help someone.

Firstly, I decided about a year ago that it was time for me to change careers. I have been fortunate to not have been unemployed at all, but I was (am still, for 2 weeks anyway) in a job that I HATE with the deepest, most burning passion. Anyway, the first thing I did was seek out education resources to help me get started in a new field. I completed a 10-month training course at a local technical college in an industry specific (oil and gas) program. I finished that program in December.

Before I finished the program, sometime in October, I started to get my feelers out. My network in that industry was non-existent, but I utilized the people that were part of the program, and some of those leads led to others. I started sending out my resume way before I actually finished my certification. I made a couple of direct HR contacts, and sent my resume to those places as well. 

One day while trying to think of other places to look for job listings, etc. it occurred to me to look on the industry association website. I'm trying not to be too specific, because it would reveal my location, but the industry has a local chapter of professional membership, and they have dinner meetings and stuff. Anyway, they had a jobs section posted on their website as well, and I found a listing that matched my skills and fired off an email to the department manager (Bypassing HR! Yay!).

About a month and a half and 2 interviews later, and I received my job offer today.

So, a few bullet points from my experience:

* New training is good. Especially when switching careers.
* Networking does help, even if you have to start from scratch. You might have to be a little obnoxious. But don't forget to send thank-you notes.
* Submitting applications to webforms on company websites is pretty much worthless.
* Look for outside-the-box places for job postings. This job wasn't posted anywhere else except the associations website.
* Patience, patience, patience. The 2 interviews and month and a half wait were excruciatingly painful as I just wanted to KNOW RIGHT NOW, but it all turned out great in the end.

So yay new job! I hope this helps someone.

**Edit:** A question below reminded me of something else I did that has been really helpful. The last class I took as part of my certification was a resume and interviewing class. I maintained contact with the lady who taught the class. She helped me polish my resume further. When I got my first interview, I took her to lunch beforehand and she helped me prepare and answered my questions. She is an HR professional with over 20 years of experience doing hiring for major corporations, so her insight was invaluable.",,False,,t5_2qhnd,True,,,True,t3_ptq0a,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ptq0a/just_got_a_job_offer_today_want_to_share_what_i/,

",54,11,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jdeab/thank_you_reddit_you_were_my_only_hope_and_now_im/,"Reddit, Thank you! I graduated at the end of 2010 with a degree in Mass Media and Communication (M.A.) and, as a lot of people predicted, couldn't get an employer in my area to give my a sideways glance let alone a job. Somewhere around application 150 I started getting depressed and wondering if my 7 years at university were worth the 80,000 I invested in them. 

After a couple of months of melancholy, I started trolling the forums here, let Reddit rip my resume to shreds and got some good advice. One of the other users PMed me and suggested I start trying each day to educate myself a little bit more. The idea being that if I'm taking a brake from working then I should make sure that each day I'm becoming more attractive to employers. I took the advice and started spending as much time working on job skills each day as I did on writing resumes. 

Since I have a passion for both, I started focusing on improving my 3nd and 4th languages and getting a bit more up to date with web design. The result was a working fluency in my 3rd language and a job as a web content manager/ multimedia producer for a European tech. start-up, which is attempting to expand their coverage into a new country/market place. 

Reddit, thanks for the advice and the support. It really did help me get though the last 3/4 year. Also I can't stress how much the suggestion helped to use unemployment as a chance to re-tool and come back into the job market with a more attractive resume. It got me my job and with a community like Reddit at your back, it's easily enough to find resources that will help you develop yourself online with little or no cost.

I have a B.A. in film and video studies and had the opportunity to use my skills to make web videos as a part of a marketing and promotions team as a temp for 1.5 years until the position ended and other marketing employees with less video production experience but greater marketing experience took over the role. I enjoy making videos have not kept my skills fresh.  

Since then, I've worked 3 years as a substitute teacher.  I have had the opportunity to work short-term and long, including an October-June gig, a September-February, and a September to December. Teaching is really cool, but as someone from a family of teachers I cannot see the merit of returning to school to get a teachable major and credentials (2-3 years) for the return on investment, especially as public education becomes more and more about teaching how to test well.  I have also worked as a student supervisor at a recreation facility (3 yrs) , taught swimming lessons (many years), been an assistant at a non-profit (over summer) , edited a master's thesis, and assisted with computer sales for a popular computer company (1 year).  

Because I am a contract sub I am given ""reasonable assurance"" of employment for the following fall and will not receive unemployment if I quit, so appear to be stuck doing this until I can find something else.  I am an excellent money saver, as I never know when my next gig is, or how long it will last.  My #1 goal is have steady employment that would allow me to move out of my parent's  basement.  I would like to achieve this as soon as possible, but recognize that more education may serve me well either before or after landing another job. 

I've applied for work as an administrative assistant, patient rep, and similar titles and am not getting a bite.  I'm dreading summer's arrival, feeling like more work is not just around the corner. 
I like being active on the job if possible, enjoy working as a part of a team as well as alone, can write, speak, and train.  In college I did not know what to major in and waffled along without a goal until I found a major I could succeed at while working. In high school I was good at science and math, but did better with languages and art.  My LinkedIn network has endorsed me for: Editing, Video Editing, Reliability, Public Speaking, Training, Teaching, Customer Service, Adobe/Mac, Research, and Social Media. 

I'm open to anything: suggestions of what skills I need to get hired now, what programs I should consider going back to school for, to what jobs and regions I should be applying to.

I was getting ready to drive on an overnight 4 hour (each way) trip this day.


-------------------


It began when I show up for work Monday morning to find the owners wife standing there in the parking lot. I think I've seen her face to face a dozen times, so this was strange. I asked her what she was up to she says that she's coming on our trip. Bemused (she knows nothing about our industry) I asked her what she'll be doing with us. She informs me that she'll be supervising us for the next two days. Let me restate that she knows NOTHING about what I do and has never been in charge of anything in my industry.  She is *just* qualified to clean up after us when we're done (not sexist, really true).

She starts looking at me, perhaps noticing the astonished look on my face, and openly challenges me with ""Get used to it, I'm half owner now"" (remember the other partner left). At this point I'm floored, so I look for comic relief (it's the way I keep my shit together) and turn to my co-worker and state ""Good, we need supervision!"". As if she was waiting for this she shoots an openly hostile ""are you being smart with me!?"" I reply that I am not... I was, but it wasn't helpful so I retreat.

At this point I can tell I need to remove myself from the situation - remember, she knows nothing about what I do and isn't qualified to supervise me or the trainee under me - and she's telling me she's half owner so she can do what she likes.

I pretend to forget the keys to my work truck, apologize and tell them I'll be back in a couple of minutes (I live close by).

I call the owner (husband) and ask him, conversationally, what his wife is doing with us today. He firms up that she is going with us. So then I ask him about her supervising my trainee and I. He says that she can do whatever she wants to do.

My shoulders slump. I tell him that if there is anything else I can do today I'd like to switch. I can't work with her - she is openly hostile towards me and I can't see spending a 4 hour car ride with her as a constructive thing to do. He says that she's an employee of this company and I'll work with here or I'm fired. 

I don't think he was ready to hear me say ""ok then"" and accept the termination, and it feels good to be free but DAMN! that was a messed up morning.


**TL;DR: Small company - owners openly hostile wife now my supervisor and there is nothing I can do about it - pull rip cord - Win! (sort of)**

EDIT: clarification

EDIT 2: Lots of talk of me having balls to do this - please don't put yourself in this situation. As mentioned in this post, always prepare before leaving by getting another job. This is a bad situation and I could have made better decisions here but what is done can't be undone.

Most of the stuff I'll say here isn't anything you won't read anywhere else; I'm just gonna say I've lived it, and it's true.

***RIGHT NOW***: Get a LinkedIn account. Create a full profile. Add everyone you know. Keep it fresh - spend some time there every week. Join groups and participate. Build your network - it's better to have a safety net *before* you lose your job. 

- The first day you're unexpectedly jobless, dig in for the long haul. Assume the attitude of someone who's been unemployed for six months with no end in sight. Details follow.
- Be open with the whole family. Tell the kids you don't have a job, and times are going to be tough for a while, but everyone needs to do their part. If it's the fall, warn them immediately that it may be an austere Christmas. 
- Cancel/downsize EVERYTHING. Drop your TV service (cable/satellite). Cut back on your cell phone service as much as possible. If you have kids and they've got unlimited text or data plans, cancel them. 
- If you're a convenience food family (hot pockets, frozen pizzas, etc) switch to proper shopping and cooking. It's way cheaper to buy good beef, chicken, pork, etc, and spend some time in the kitchen than buying frozen crap. 
- Quit soda &amp; beer. Drink water. It's better for you anyway. 
- Stop renewing magazines. 
- Review your entire household budget. Get two months of bank records and look at where your money goes. Start slashing. 
- Review all your automated payments. You probably want to cancel them all and go to writing checks (switch to a credit union if your asshole bank charges for checks). Nothing like having a finely crafted plan to keep a bunch of creditors happy get wiped out by an automated mortgage payment that could've waited a month. 
- Call all your creditors and tell them you're unemployed. Ask about structured payment plans or forbearance options. You may not need to go there on day one, but know what your options are. 
- Always answer the phone to talk to creditors. Talking to them and telling them you're unemployed will always result in a better situation than ducking phone calls. 
- Cancel every credit card possible, consolidate them down to the lowest-interest ones. But make sure to keep some credit room. 
- Replacing a transmission costs $4,000. Keep in mind the possibility of needing emergency funds. 
- While you want to go as austere as possible, try not to go full Charles Dickens. Perhaps budget for a family night at the movies or an inexpensive restaurant once a month. YMMV. 
- If you were a one-income family and your kids are relatively self-sufficient, time for the other partner to go find work. 

Essentially, cutting your expenses as early as possible extends your survival time. 

Job hunting:  

- Get accounts on every job board. Update your resume *every day.* Recruiters generally look at resumes posted in the last 24 hours. 
- If the phone isn't ringing, hack up your resume. Change things around. Leave your resume comfort zone. If nobody's calling, you can't do worse. 
- Hiring *sucks* in the winter. If you're jobless after Halloween, start preparing to be unemployed until February. Don't give up hope, but be prepared. 
- If your experience is a bit broad, then have several targeted resumes - try to focus the resume towards the job you're applying for. 
- Write cover letters. They're stupid, but there are recruiters and hiring managers who won't read a resume without them. 
- If your expertise lends itself towards online expression, build a website and start expressing. You've got the free time now - use it. 
- If you are only getting a few calls, and they're all lower incomes than you're used to, start interviewing. If nothing else, it lets you keep your interviewing skills fresh. But take the first job you can, even if it pays 3/4 what you're used to. Because it's still more than you're making otherwise. 
- Don't job hop. If you *do* grab an underpaying job early, plan to spend a few months there while you sharpen your job hunt. Don't try to stair-step your way up - grab one job early, stay there until you make the final leap to where you want to stay. 
- Keep a calendar on your desk. First of all it's handy for scheduling interviews, but also - every day write down how many days you've been out of work. It's far too easy to drift along and suddenly realize it's been three months and you haven't really done much to find a job. 
- Be proactive. After going through job sites and ensuring your resume is up to date, think about places you would like to work. Research them a bit, look for folks you're connected to on LinkedIn who work there or have worked there. After you've done the research, send a well-written targeted cover letter and resume to a hiring manager and to their recruiter. They may have a job req that's not posted yet, or they may remember you when they have an opening. Bottom line is that it doesn't cost you anything to do this. 
- If you're interviewing for suit-type jobs, you need at least two suits. One for the first interview, one for the callback. 
- Get a copy of [""Selling to VITO""](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580622240?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andmyaxe-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1580622240 ""Amazon Associates link thingy""). It's about the sales approach to access executives, but there's a lot of good advice that flows over to a job search as well. 
- Just my personal experience, may not apply to you: do **not** take the axe to an interview unless it's necessary for the job. Really doesn't go over well. 

- Stay on a regular schedule. If you're a night owl, time to switch to ""early to bed, early to rise."" Sorry. 
- Your job search should take the morning. After lunch, work on some work-related hobby. Get certified, build skills, work with new tools, etc.

I have been employed in a high tech field for a number of years.  I recently began to consider other opportunities (within the same field however different industry) so I placed my CV on several job posting sites.  

I was contacted by a recruiter for an opening.  The description of the job was a bit specialized but was overall a good fit so I sent the recruiter the requested information (e.g. experience with X, experience with Y, whether or not I have a masters degree, etc).  Subsequent to that email I spoke with the recruiter via the phone and, per request, I stated my desired salary range.  

Shortly thereafter the recruiter sent an email wishing to confirm the salary range that we spoke about.  Part of this confirmation requests that I include one of the following; last four digits of my Social Security number or my driver’s license number.  Is this a common practice for recruiting?  Thus far, I have not been requested such information at such an early stage so I come to you r/jobs and seek your advice as to if this is common practice.

Thanks for your help!

First let me thank everyone who provided some really great advice right when I needed it.  I brought several copies of my real resume and highlighted the pertinent bits so I could more easily hand it over and be nonchalant.

It was a three stage interview with different groups of people (Hiring manager, engineers, and HR), each with their own reactions.  The hiring manager was completely indifferent - almost dismissive.  he didn't care about the specifics, experience, or details - just whether I was competent and could do the work.  

The engineers were split.  One didn't care, the other outright said they were looking for someone with more experience.

HR actually preferred the recruiter's resume, since it was easier for them to read (i.e. a little stripped down and more tailored to the job posting).  Go figure.

The interview was....OK.  I was a little uneasy given the resume mix-up and, between that and some other things going on in my life, I didn't prepare as much as I should have.  That became uncomfortably obvious at probably the most important part of the interview and I'm sure my combination of ignorance and stage-fright left a bad impression. I felt pretty awful about that.

Afterwards, the manager staged a few hypothetical situations I might encounter on the job to see how I would react to various things.  I aced that.  He seemed a bit confused about me not being able to satisfactorily answer some basic questions, but be more than capable at performing the job duties.  We'll see what comes of it.

Regardless of what happens, this has been a valuable learning piece for me and I feel wiser for the experience. Again, thanks to everyone who lent their advice.

My name is David and I am a native of New Jersey. I spent my younger years slacking severely and goofing off and thus was kicked out of high school at 17. As a result I was kicked out of my home and forced to find a way on my own. I spent the next 2 years squatting in an abandoned house without electricity or hot water. During this period I met the love of my life, a Filipino girl named Grace who would become just that for me, my saving Grace. She took care of me and loved me unconditionally regardless of the fact that I was bum. 

 One day I remembered that my uncle had started a small savings account for me when i was small and so I tracked him down and gained access to the account, pulling all one thousand some odd dollars out of it. I used this money to get my self and my squatting mates ( my cousin and his girlfriend ) out of this hell hole and put a deposit on a two bedroom apartment across town. We planned to hold this 1,200 dollar a month apt. with the money we had from our minimum wage mall jobs. Sadly this lasted only four- five months. My roommates never paid a cent towards rent and we lost this apartment and I developed quite a lump of debt. By the age of nineteen I left my two bedroom apt (my cousin ran away across the country and his girl left him) and went to live with my girl at her parents for the next couple of years. The entire time I lived with her was a secret to her parents, so I spent all my days hiding under beds, jumping in and out of second floor windows, and sleeping in her car when we couldn't sneak me in.

 At the age of 21 we both landed a pretty decent job working super market renovations and soon we had saved up enough to try and get our own place! We currently still live there but.... my job fired me for speaking negatively about a man who was part of another company that we were working along side of.

 Now, rent is tight every month and I still remain a man child with no high school diploma or license. I've filled out over 20 applications in the past week alone with no luck. Every morning the hunt for a job brings me to tears and I fight back the idea of ending my life constantly.

 I know this is no ones fault but my own. I know that I have to fix this by myself. I've never desired to better myself for my own sake. I have realized that my worse fear isn't losing my apt, it is letting grace down and never becoming anything and living a meaningless life.

I've had this new job for a while, and it's no thanks to this subreddit or any of its speculators. Getting this job was the result of doing everything *opposite* of what is commonly featured here. I do not say this to be arrogant, but to offer a possible theory that, sometimes, it's all just dumb luck.

* It wasn't through a networked contact.
* I didn't write a cover letter at all, much less a tailored one.
* My resume was text-heavy, featuring more than two or three bullet points describing my accomplishments in detail.
* My interview was just a formality - it didn't matter what color my suit was, or how I answered their questions. 
* I didn't write a thank-you note. Not that I even had the chance - I received an offer before I got home from my shift that day.

They wanted me because of my skills and abilities. Ones that I possessed *even right out of school*. It annoyed me somewhat that, while these guys were so eager and ready to integrate me, many others thought I was not even qualified for entry-level work. Yet, it is a relief to find a career-starter that appreciated me because of what I know and what I can do, rather than how well I kissed their asses during the entire process.

I would not dare have the ego to assume that any of my actions led to my employment, so I will not lay it out in a tome for others to follow. As a matter of fact, a huge factor in giving me an offer was due to accessibility in funding to continue certain projects, not how impressive I was during the process. I just want to say, for those struggling job-seekers, it is not impossible for this to occur. There are real hiring personnel out there that appreciate what you already have, and perform professionally to bring you out of the pool.",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_wsje1,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wsje1/i_won_the_lottery/,

Update to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lvl91/sneakily_abusive_and_untouchable_boss_what_do_i/) four months ago. Since I posted this, the other editors who were considering quitting have left the paper - one quit, and the other was ""let go"" for unclear reasons. I stayed on as long as I could for the good of my staff, but I can't do it anymore.

When I leave, I'll be the sixth senior editor to leave the paper this year alone. The editorial staff is all practically new. For the past two months, the paper has been relying heavily on me to keep it going. At the same time, however, the editor-in-chief has been laying blame on me for things that aren't even remotely my fault (e.g. two typos in the headlines of another section made it to print? Totally timeofthedecade's fault).

I'm going to leave my letter of resignation (carefully written to avoid even mentioning why I'm leaving) on my boss's desk as soon as he okays my pages, and then I'm walking out. It's technically my 2 weeks notice, so he'll be able to ask about it on Monday.

Thanks, r/jobs, for the support you've given me. I wish it hadn't come to this, but I can't stay here and be abused, devalued, disrespected, and harassed at this job anymore. My boss from my other job has sympathized with the situation and given me both a raise and a promotion for when I return to full time with him. So this has got to be the best thing I can do right now.

Two hundred miles of twisting, mountain roads.  Two hundred miles of traffic, of bland countryside, of strung out meth heads who may not even have a driver's license to begin with.

At this career fair, there were exactly five booths.  Three of them, I had seen from a similar fair I'd attended two weeks ago.  One of them wasn't even hiring, but was hoping to get people back into school.  One of them was for the city government.  They would not accept my resume, because they wish to hire solely from the online application system that I have spent the last two years pounding my head and heart and soul against to no avail.

I spent 45 minutes at that fair talking to an accountant from out of state.  He was possibly the most incredibly dull man I've ever met in my entire life.  I listened to him ramble for nearly an hour, solely because he hinted that he may know a friend of a friend of a friend who might have something that wasn't even potentially full-time.

That accountant was the most success I had today.

I had other plans lined up, of course.  I'd charted out all the big corporate headquarters within my field, and hit them after lunch.  Most had terrible phone mazes that lead nowhere, or voicemail from hell that would never be heard.  A precious few, I'd actually talked to people on the inside, and I was tentatively hopeful.

An office worker of IBM let me in, but they just pointed at a 'no soliciting' sign and threatened to call security, when I asked them where HR was.

Hewlett Packard wouldn't even let me in.

Intel is what I remember the most.  Its front desk was manned by a squat balding man.  When I asked him where HR was, he laughed in my face.  He got that gleam that shines in every sadist's eye when they have a tiny bit of power to abuse.  His voice dripped with sarcasm.  ""It's called _the internet_.  We don't hire _anybody_ on site.""

In my first 3 weeks at this job I made a simple scheduling error with a package delivery. No money was lost, and no clients were affected in any way. When my boss found out he tore me to shreds over the phone. I just basically sat there and took it. Needless to say I was terribly upset afterwards. Since this was my first 'real' job, it also left me confused.

Is it normal for bosses to yell at their employees over honest mistakes?

Should I have handled the situation differently? (during and after the yelling) How would you have handled it?

My team is small and I rarely have to hire people. But, I had an opening and got to go through the process over the last few weeks. I thought I'd share to let you see how decisions are made sometimes.

I picked 5 resumes out of the stack HR gave me based on relevant experience. Not necessarily perfect, but close enough that I know they could learn what they need to know. The people I didn't pick for interviews either had resumes without much detail or experience from less credible companies. 

4 of them accepted the interview and one had just taken another job. 

The first candidate was older than I expected based on his résumé, but seemed very qualified. I knew right away I wouldn't hire him, though, because he seemed like he'd be bored at the job. His experience was a lot more fast-paced than this job would be. 

The second candidate didn't wear a suit, and I noticed, but she was still one of my finalists. She also brought up her kids in the interview. But, she seemed eager and like she learned quickly. I though we'd work we'll together based on personality. 

The third candidate was my boss' favorite and she was well-suited for the job. She seemed competent and nice, but I'm hoping to change the position over the next year and she seems like the candidate for now and not the candidate for a year from now. There was nothing wrong with her, though, and I think she'd do the job fine.

By the time the last candidate came in I was pretty sure I was already hiring the second one. But, #4 blew me away. She had really great examples of work, even though she talked way too much. She doesn't have some of the technical skills, but she seemed eager to learn and had some ideas I wouldn't have thought of myself. I think she'll be a good balance for me even though I don't see us being friends outside of work. We didn't have much in common besides liking what we do. 

#2 and #3 are the only ones that wrote thank you notes and neither note stood out. They seemed typical.

I don't want to say I lucked into the position bc I did work very hard to make the most of the opportunity presented and have all the skills of someone in a similar position despite only being in the industry for a couple years.

1352229367.0,42,self.jobs,12qt7z,"Been unemployed since June, really depressed that I can't find a job, and my best friend just got a job at a place I applied despite already having a job. Need some advice.",54,12,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12qt7z/been_unemployed_since_june_really_depressed_that/,"So like I said in the title, I've been unemployed since June. I was laid off from my previous job where I was a children's book illustrator. I loved that job and the people there, but the management made the decision to get rid of some people here and hire people in the Phillipines. It sucks, but that is just the facts. I have done a really good job of not focusing on that and being bitter, I think.

I have a Bachelor's degree, and I have a really good work history. I have a great resume and portfolio, not to mention great references and even a reference letter from my time as an illustrator. I worked in a restaurant as a server, a cashier, and dish help for 6 months. Then I got a job at a retail store where I did just about everything in the store. I opened and closed most days, did office management, handled warranties and returns, gave superb customer service, etc. I did that for 3 and a half years. After that I got a job shortly after graduating college at a publishing company where I worked for 11 months as a children's book illustrator, then they laid off 24 people (me included).

I'm not sure what, if anything, I am doing wrong. But I can't seem to find a job.

Well, I guess that's not entirely true. I could probably find a retail job if I was looking, but I am trying to avoid that. My 3 years of work experience during college was a retail store, where I was miserable. I am a great employee and great with customers, but I really hate doing customer service work in a retail store. I hate the hours, working weekends and evenings and not seeing my friends and family. I really, really don't want to go back to retail hours and experiences for a job.

Is that all I have?

Unfortunately, I live in a state where there isn't much call for artists or illustrators. What jobs are available are scooped up pretty quickly, or they are so honed and specific that I don't have the skills for it and nobody is willing to train me, despite me being willing to learn. My college experience was great but because I wanted to stay close to home I didn't get the experience needed for specific skills or software to be in the industry I want to be in. I plan to go back wither for a Master's or at least to take specific skills and get experience with the programs I need (for example: Maya or Flash). The problem is, I don't have the money to go back to school. I went through my first college experience without racking up any debt, and I refuse to take loans and do so for my second bout.

I am planning on moving in a few years to a place that has the industry I want to get into more heavily, but I am barely affording to live in a state with a lower cost of living right now. 

I am looking into administrative type jobs, clerical work, on top of illustration or graphic arts. I did a lot of clerical work in my retail job for 3.5 years because I handled just about everything related to the job as I was the only employee and my bosses left me alone most days while they dealt with their life and the higher end parts of their store. I really enjoyed the clerical work, but no one seems to be interested in hiring me for that.

I thought I was going to get hired into a bank, working in loans in the back office, and it would have been perfect for me. My friend applied to the same place (because they were hiring tons of people as they opened new branches, etc). He ended up getting a job there, and I haven't heard back from them in 3 weeks now. It's safe for me to assume they don't want me. I am just really depressed about this whole thing.

What is wrong with me or my resume or whatever that I can't get a job? I don't blame my friend for wanting to leave his job at Wal-Mart, but I'm upset that he was able to get hired somewhere when he HAS a job, and I am drawing unemployment. I don't want to be drawing unemployment, I never did, but it's necessary for me to pay for my rent and car payments. I would rather have a job. I am working with tons of recruitment agencies that aren't doing a damn thing to help me find a job, despite my constant emails to them. I am applying to more than the required number of job searches each week to look for a job.

I don't know what else to do.

**TL;DR** - I don't know what I am doing wrong to find a job. I need help, and I am really depressed about not being able to find one. I really don't want to work in retail again, and if I do get retail work I will have to take two jobs to support myself. Is that really my only option?

Success!,54,11,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iv4z8/two_months_and_8_interviews_later_success/,"I just went through a grueling interview process with one of my favorite ad agencies. Yes, **eight** interviews with the same company over a span of two months. But I followed the steps from advice given here in jobbit and they offered me my dream job today!


* Networking: *Check*. I was contacted by them because a mutual colleague had passed on my résumé to them.

* Researching the Company: *Check*. This was actually pretty easy, they were already a favorite of mine but bringing up some campaigns I admired and their recent awards sure helped.

* Thank You Notes: *Check*. Since I had to come back so many times, I hand delivered each handwritten note.

* Follow-Up: *Check*. There would be some long periods in between some of the interviews, of course I didn't check in every day but after a week or so it helps.

* Equally Listen as Much as You Speak. *Check*

* Always Be On Time. *Check*


Additional Advice:

* Be enthusiastic about your industry. Not just wanting to work within it, but reading about it and actively following it. Not only that, you'll learn a lot about what people in that industry are currently doing and how they got there.

* Bring a notebook. Taking notes will help you remember what you discussed so you can bring it up in your thank you note. It'll also help you remember any additional questions you may have.

* Remember everyone that you meet. The receptionists at this particular company happened to be twins, and I remembered both of their names. They represent the company since they're the first ones you meet, and they interact with everyone there. Be nice to receptionists and they'll return the favor.

* Dress to impress and have a firm handshake. I was complimented on both of these: first impressions are everything.

* Prepare for anything. I live in the city and it's the dead of summer. It comes as a bit of a challenge to find something nice to wear but light enough so you don't get sweat stains. I packed with me: a washcloth to wipe down excess sweat, a pack of gum to thwart coffee breath, ten copies of my résumé, an extra shirt, and an umbrella.

* Be Patient. Keep yourself busy. I took up volunteering while on the job hunt. Not only did it free up some free time, but it was karmic rewarding and made for some great stories.

Skip forward 2 months, mid-life crisis takes over and my boss actually decides to quit. Now, I'm 2 months into the probation period for my ""assistant XX"" and the company decides to make me ""XX""... with another 3 month probation. So basically the probation period for this whole thing would be for 5 months (wtf, almost half a year).


Normally I'd be cool with it (since I'm being promoted), but my salary is only going to be adjusted after the probation period ends. In this case, that would mean I had a lot of extra duties piled on me for 2 months... with no pay increase. Considering talking to HR and the manager, but I don't really want them to seem like I'm just doing it for the money (although it's kinda true...).

I interviewed for a position at KPMG the other day.  It's 5 miles away from where my wife and I want to live (where there are very few jobs - most people commute into the city which is about an hour on the train), is in the field I studied in grad school (I would say that I have a lot of experience for the position but I'm not super passionate about the work), and would obviously pay pretty well and have growth opportunities.

I interviewed with three different people (half hour with each one) and tried to get a sense of the work environment from each.  The first person was a Director and without me bringing it up, he said bad days at the office would probably keep me there until midnight or 1am.  The second person was an Associate Director who said he has two kids and generally works 9am-5:45pm and works another hour from home each night.  The third person was also an Associate Director and said that it's a demanding job and that it's not uncommon to get an e-mail on a Saturday night asking for something to be done by Monday morning.

In the end I did not get it, but the agency kept my resume.  Now, before I start my story, I will say I have never worked with a staffing agency before, I have always dealt directly with the company involved.

A couple of weeks ago, a lady from this agency contacted me wanting me to meet with her about a position locally that she felt I would be a good fit for.  So I met with her, and she told me she once again said that she felt like I would be a good fit and would recommend me for an interview with the company and walked me out telling me that we would know more by the end of the following week and the company should get hold of me by e-mail or phone.  She never said to contact her if there were questions or that she would be who contacted me.

I have talked to a few friends in the business world (These are big name companies too) who stated that it would be a great position and that I really need to make myself noticed.  All recommended sending the company an updated resume geared more towards the position.  

A side note - I am very well qualified for the position and I wanted them to see this.  My other resume did not really show my skills related to this specific job.

So late last week I sent a short e-mail to the administrator who I was told was doing the interviewing and just expressed my interest in the position and wanted to drop her an updated resume/reference sheet, and thanked her for her time.  

The next day after sending the e-mail, I received a call from the lady at the staffing agency who told me that the company wanted to interview me and immediately started chewing me out for sending an e-mail directly to the company.  She said she had just gotten a phone call from the company chewing her out because I contacted them.  She told me that ""You don't do this in the business world""  She wanted to know what I thought I was going to accomplish by doing this, why didn't I contact her and told me that she had to get me out of this situation, and was able to still get me an interview.

I would answer her questions, to which she would just argue with me, I even apologized and she told me that I ""didn't need to apologize to her, I needed to apologize to myself.  She didn't give a rats ass if I got the job"" after this.

I was led to believe that my name would be given to the company and this would be the last I have ever heard from the staffing agency.  I have always heard that you need to make yourself stand out, that is what I was trying to do by updating the resume.  I did not go all out in the e-mail I sent.  

Well in the end, it worked, I got an interview, but I am trying to figure out what I did wrong here.  It has been a number of years since I have had to interview for a new job, so my question is, is it no longer a good thing to put yourself out there to be noticed? 

Maybe I am trying to make myself feel better, but my only rational thought about this butt chewing I received is that my name was NOT given to the company, they saw my resume and called her wanting to know why I was not on their interview list.

So my friends of reddit, if my mistake was going out on my own, over the agency, I plead guilty.  In my defense, I never have had an agency contact me, and like I said earlier was led to believe this would be the last I heard from them.

If I messed up otherwise, what did I do wrong?

I am soon to be PhD graduate who survived 15 months of severe depression and now need career advice.,55,16,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1eil7b/dear_redditors_i_need_your_advice_i_am_soon_to_be/,"Hey Redditors I am in need of some serious help. 

I have been battling severe depression for the last 15 months and only now the fog is kind of lifting. I was towards the end of my PhD when my depression struck and as I was hospitalized for about 8 months I had to take an extended leave of absence. My professor was nice enough to allow me to finish when I got better but the project unfortunately was in a very competitive field and my results have already been published by a competing lab. So I have been suggested to write up my thesis without any publications as that is accepted here for a getting a degree. I have a lot of laboratory experience and also have been the elected representative of my graduate school and have been the head of an organizing committee which has successfully organized international symposiums for 3 years with prestigious speakers from around the world including Noble Laureates.

My depression was the result of certain repressed memories from my childhood (sexual abuse by my older sibling and cousin) making an unwelcome appearance in the conscious part of my brain. I went through intensive trauma therapy and had to work very hard to get back to my 'normal' life. 

Now that I am trying to pick up the pieces of my life I find myself in a ridiculous position where suddenly my career does not seem as bright,  my once wide social circle has shrunk down to a core few and everyone is busy accomplishing things while I am stuck in one place. 

I feel like I am done with being in the lab 24/7. the past 15 months have obviously changed me as a person and my research which was a very big part of my life is no longer something I identify with. I no longer see myself doing a postdoc and working in academia and discovering brilliant things in my field. It was a very hard decision but I realized that I don't want to spend the next 10 years in a lab. Having said that I still love science and cannot imagine leaving the field altogether. I have an excellent bachelors degree and two masters degrees and lot of experience in labs around Europe.

The things that still make me happy are editing my colleagues/students written works as well as promoting the exchange of ideas between scientists or students not just within my discipline but across the varied fields of science.  

I would love to join either a scientific journal/publishing house or manage an international graduate school. This is where I need your help Redittors, any suggestions of what kind of job I could look for. What career opportunities are available for someone who wants to remain in science but give up the lab.

I'm having a shitty enough day thanks to a soul crushing interview at Circle K I had today. I have been job searching in Arizona for a full-time job for over two years. Over this time I have had maybe 10 interviews. All of which basically came to a screeching halt followed by a ""thanks for coming down, we'll give you a call if we decide to hire you"", because when asked about reliable transportation I tell them I ride the bus. This wouldn't be a problem, except the bus system is shit and their mission statement might as well be ""I'll get there when I get there"". Also, I am an obviously gay man living in a state where the only thing more horrible than that are Mexicans, Sex Offenders, and Murderers. On top of all this, I suffer from depression, ADHD, tourettes, and short term memory loss thanks to brain surgery I had when I was a kid. This lowers my tolerance threshold for putting up getting yelled at (being criticized doesn't bother me, but being called worthless by a manager will cause me to quit on the spot). Every day I job search, it just demotivates me because every starting level position requires 2 years experience or a bachelors degree in anything no matter how irrelevant.

That being said, I do have a few things working for me. I have just under 2 years of customer service experience. I feel that I have a lot to offer, despite my dispositions. I am very enthusiastic when I am working and I am upbeat and energetic every day (even on my crappiest of days I still put on my happy mask and nobody will even know). I don't even know what to do anymore and sometimes I fantasize about packing my shit and moving to California or some other state where there are a lot of career opportunities.

----------------------------------
Edit: TLDR: I am dealing with two sets of catch 22s... First is that I can't get a job without having experience, and I can't get experience without having a job. The second catch 22 is that I can't get a car because I don't have a job, and I can't get a job because I don't have a car. On top of that I am dealing with psychological issues stemming from brain surgery and I am gay in a dominantly homophobic state.

If this is the case then I do apologise, it was never my intent.

***First a bit of background information***

Im a 25 year old bloke living in England and I feel at a complete loss.
I left college with a few A levels to my name and never made it to university due to some personal issues with family at home ( I pretty much needed to go into employment during college time to help keep the family going)
After college ended I shifted my part time retail job into full time and moved out of my parents house as soon as possible, getting out of a toxic environment but basically tying myself to the 9-5 in order to fund it.

Since then I've bounced around from job to job (closures and redundancies have kinda tore the place apart) making sure I always had money coming in to support but not really getting anywhere long term.

Fast forward to now and there is only one big employer left in my small town, I have worked there for 6 years now and I absolutely detest it.
The pay is not actually terrible for the responsibilities given but the work is the most mind numbing that I have ever encountered (and this is someone that spent 2 years working tills in retail in a small population town for 9 hours a day) and to top it off my boss is ludicrously incompetent.

Typical comments from her include :
""I'm moving you to 10pm finishes because we all need to pull together for the good of the department, no exceptions - oh? why haven't I done the same for the others? well they are older and deserve more respect""
and
""Sometimes I need to make an example of staff just to make sure that everyone is kept in check - and this time it's you""
And this is some of the tamer stuff.

Of course I've made complaints and asked to be moved around but the level of managers above her dont give 2 shits as long as the numbers from the department come through okay (which they do because we actually ARE efficient at our job despite how miserable we are made to feel for it) and in order to move departments you need to have a positive recommendation from your current team lead - something she will never give because she knows she wouldn't be able to get away with half the shit she pulls on me towards other more 'respectable' members of staff.

To make it worse we were all asked to voluntarily change our contracts to allow us to work any time between 7am in the morning and 11pm at night, as somebody who has a lot of outside of work activities in order to compensate and justify the hell that place puts me through every day, in the form of martial arts training, gym schedules, poker nights and 6 a side soccer twice a week I flat refused, allowing work to have control over my private life was just one step too far! 
But of course after i failed to volunteer i was taken into an office and basically shouted into changing it, stating that in 3 months time my current contract ended, and that this new flexible one was the only actual contract renewal I was going to get, basically do it or you dont have a job.
Not being an idiot and wanting to still have a job, i begrudgingly did it.

Now i'm trapped - I have a wonderful girlfriend of 7 years who I dont get t spend any time with because her normal shift pattern is the direct opposite of the ones i normally get put on. We have our own flat which I NEED to stay in employment for us to keep, and i can't do any of my personal out of work activities because this contract allows them to change the shift im working with no notice (for example, working 7 -4pm one day then being told im doing 2pm - 11pm the next)

There are no other recruiters in the area and every other job i've applied for has either been a step sideways or I have not got it.

I'm done taking jobs solely because they are not the place i'm at right now, i've made many of those 'not really an advancement' transitions before and I'm at the stage where i need to be sensible and make sure any action I take is working towards something that is actually worth my time.

***Now on to the actual question.***

As much as I hate this place I am not an idiot, I know I am very fortunate to have a job at the moment and will not throw it away for the sake of moral high ground, however I want to get out and I want to go towards my interests. My two main loves are writing and technology, both of these things are hobbies I do in my spare time and have a lot of home taught experience in IT maintenance and networking, but without any real qualifications in those areas convincing an employer that I'm worth their attention even for an interview is hard.
I've considered going back to college and brushing up on my skills - but I cant take time out from work, and night classes are not a total set thing given my work schedule fluctuations. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to make myself more employable or brush up in these areas? After being in the 9-5 (if im lucky) for the past 9 years I feel genuinely out of the game and want to do anything i can, even if its in my own time to try and work towards a career.

I understand that we can't all have jobs that we want, and that  if we all were to happy in our employment then there would never be those people doing the necessary jobs that everyone hates, but i'll be damned if i'm not going to try and push my chances on getting at least amicable employment.

Sorry for rambling a lot, never intended the post to spill over to this - but 

**TL:DR - Stuck in despicable job for several years and feel out of the game, can't rely on family for support and looking for a way to brush up my skills or start my own path towards working in writing/tech based jobs**

1346800212.0,44,self.jobs,zd18t,I almost unsubscribed to this subreddit this morning on account of me being employed for 5 months.  Found out I will be laid off this afternoon.  Freaky.,50,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zd18t/i_almost_unsubscribed_to_this_subreddit_this/,"This morning I went to work all cocky and confident, thinking I'd unsubscribe to this subreddit.  After all, things have been going well at work, I enjoy my coworkers, I kick ass at my job.  This afternoon I found out that our contract will not be renewed (human services sector) and that we will be out of a job effective October 31.

I've been kicked around a lot since I graduated in 2010.  I've held 2 jobs (and been unemployed in spurts) and both jobs ended due to contracts falling apart.  In this time period my mental health and finances took a severe hit.  I just recently returned to a point of sanity and relative financial assurance when this went down.

We had an abruptly scheduled meeting offsite, which set off big red flags with me.  We were also told we could go home after, which also seemed suspicious.  When the HR people began walking into the room I began to hyperventilate.  As soon as they said the contract will not be renewed, I brown down crying.  Luckily, I was not the only one.  We were then taken back to meet with the HR team to discussed exactly how this would go down.

I've got say, as much as being laid off sucks, this could have gone way worse.  The contract ends October 31, giving me 2 months to get another job.  I had not been looking at all.  I absolutely love what I do.  I have the utmost respect for my bosses.  Wherever they end up working, I will certainly consider.  I also was explained to why the contract was not renewed and the reality was that the county's needs were too different from our mission, which I can almost respect because I've worked for nonprofits who will do whatever unconscionable contortion in complete contradiction with their mission to please some contractor, which in turn makes life miserable for me as an employee because as someone who works in human services, I cannot abide enforcing certain policies that I do not think are in my clients' best interests.  Everyone was really kind.  My manager who was, for completely unrelated reasons, to be moving to a different contract in the coming months told me to seriously consider working there.  The agency also said that they may begin hiring for positions that were supposed to wait until 2013 to begin.  

The last time I got laid off, I had 2 weeks notice and it was totally personal between me and the supervisors (who incidentally were fired 2 months later).  I fell into a bottle and didn't climb out for quite some time.  I had a bit of a nervous breakdown.  I freaked out and drove around the desert for a while rambling nonsense into the voice recorder function on my phone.  I called suicide hotlines.  I did not think very highly of myself.  I got myself therapy, resolved some damn issues, got myself a job and moved on.

I'm hoping that I can either a) get an outside job before November 1, b) be hired by whoever the new vendor is for that contract.  c) get a job with my current agency.  And I'm hoping I don't go crazy this time.

TL;DR: Being laid off 3 times in 2 years bites, but at least this time I have time and my employer wasn't super dickish about it.",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_zd18t,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zd18t/i_almost_unsubscribed_to_this_subreddit_this/,

1335301280.0,43,self.jobs,sqkkn,[Last update to] my boss threw a hissy fit.,48,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/sqkkn/last_update_to_my_boss_threw_a_hissy_fit/,"Reddit, it has been an interesting couple months since this last post: http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qjh0f/another_update_to_boss_threw_a_hissy_fit/. First, my ex-boss lied to the unemployment office and said I quit--even though he told prospective employers that he fired me when they called to verify employment. Luckily, the case worker at the unemployment office determined that I was fired (after four weeks of back and forth), and my ex-boss had to pay up. Also, I demanded that he pay me for all my wages and, while he paid me the overtime, he has yet to pay me for my vacation hours. I'm still trying to decide whether or not I want to pursue a case against him for this.

Fifty applications and 10 interviews later, I did find another job in my field. I made sure to really keep my eye out for any red flags during the interview process this time and feel really good about the group of people I'll be working with. When my new employers asked me why I left my last job, I was honest about how I was expected to do the work of three previously full-time positions in 20-30 hours per week and how I couldn't do quality work in that amount of time. I never had to tell them that I was technically fired, and they were super understanding about the reason I gave. I start tomorrow and couldn't be more excited!

Even though I've had a hard time being unemployed these last couple months, it's amazing how much happier I've been. If your job isn't a good fit, it's so easy for it to eat away at you. For the last month at the firm, I would come home every night and cry. I was making the most money I have ever made in my life, but I never wanted to go out. It really messed with my self esteem, too, being told that I wasn't worth the $19/hr my ex-boss was paying me even though he was charging his clients $105/hr for my services.

Now, I know that I hated those posts on r/jobs that were like, ""I found a job! Now do this, and you'll get one too,"" but these tips really helped me and I feel obligated to pass them on. 

1.) Dress for the part! The night before an important interview, I laid out my outfit: a gray skirt, gray tights, blue button-down, and blue scarf. I made sure my shoes were shined and my backpack was clean and went to bed. The next morning, I started to freak out because my outfit wasn't really professional enough for a corporate attorneys' office. So, just hours before my interview, I picked out a conservative black pencil skirt, white button-down, and black blazer, and then I topped it off with nylons and a professional tote that fit all my paperwork. The whole outfit cost me a fair amount, but it really boosted my confidence, and that showed during the interview.

2.) Thank you letters! For every interview I had (even phone interviews), I sent a thank you email and snail-mail card to every person who interviewed me. One interview was with a panel of five people, so I went home that night and wrote five personalized emails based on the specific questions they asked me, and then I sent them--in addition to the receptionist who gave me all their information--a thank you card. Granted, I didn't get a second interview with them (the job was seriously out of my league considering my experience level), but they made sure to call me soon after and let me know they appreciated my thoughtfulness.

3.) Further your skills! I was getting very restless staying at home every day filling out applications, so I looked for a class that would allow me to keep on top of my skills while passing the time. I found an InDesign course at my local community college and signed up. I didn't really have the money for it, so I called my alma mater and asked them if they had any professional development funds available for recent grads. It turns out they did, and they paid for $200 of the $275 I needed. Even though I already had a lot of design experience before this, taking the class helped me learn more about the little bells and whistles of the program, it got me out of the house, it allowed me to build up my portfolio, and it showed my new employer that I am self-motivated.

4.) De-stress! This one is so hard to do when you don't have the funds. When I'm unemployed, I put everything on my credit card, so I know how guilty it makes you feel to spend a little money on yourself--but it's seriously important. I made an effort to go out every once in awhile on the cheap. For instance, my favorite local bar has $2 Tuesdays. So, instead of going out with friends on Friday and Saturday, I would go out Tuesday nights, have a drink or two, and then invite my friends to make food with me at home on the weekends. And this brings me to my last suggestion:

5.) Let your friends help you! I have always been very self-sufficient to the point that it is difficult for me to accept help. But when you find yourself unemployed, swallow your pride a little and let your friends do their part. I always knew I had a great support system, but it still amazed me just how far they went to offer a helping hand. They insisted on paying for things I felt foolish spending money on (like movie theater tickets), others sacrificed going out for staying in, and my SO really showed his support by offering to move into my 1br apartment with me for awhile so that I could afford rent. It made me feel really special to see their kindness in action, and now that I have a job, I will be sure to pay it back (and forward).

I've been out of a job for quite some time. Laid off in 2008. I've been in school for this whole time pursing marketing and recently came across a rather awesome opportunity to intern for a major visual-tech company. 

I landed an interview, aced it, followed with an email and a phone call...the feedback I was given was that my interview went ""very very well"" and my presentation was ""excellent."" I was told that, ""You are the number one candidate."" Mind you all this for an $8 dollar an hour Mon-Fri, 8 hour a day internship. So, all this is great news to know that I was the first to be interviewed for this position and that the interview went well. Thursday I find out that they are calling my professional references, so to me, this is another good sign. Things are moving forward. 

Friday comes and on this day, I was told that they would have finalized who they want for the position. Of course things are looking good for me or so I thought. I get a phone call towards the end of Friday from the company, I excitingly pick up the phone only to hear, ""Unfortunately, we have decided to go with someone else because they have internship experience and they've done it twice before.""

What in the hell is ""internship experience?"" Isn't the whole point behind an internship to gain experience, so why hire someone who has done it twice before, why doesn't this person not have a full time job by now? 

Super bummed about it. I really needed this. Is there something else going on here? I don't understand...

Am I right in thinking this is a little odd? Anyone else go through something similar? 

EDIT: I'm not trying to be some complainer talking about how I didn't land this job, but more so the implications of how strange it is. I understand that there are tons of people out there right now in the market looking for a job and that such a thing I went through happens everyday to said people, but in this case I really did just feel it was strange. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention that this was a 2-3 Month internship. There was no absolute promise of going full time/salary after the internship period, however it was mentioned to me that they didn't want whoever is hired to simply just disappear and that they would attempt to find a position within the company that one could full-fill.

My SO and I just picked up our lives and job in South Texas to move to Denver, CO with the promise of a stable, similar, good paying job. He's been working there 3 weeks. Well, she got the pay part right. 

While what he's doing now is in his field, it's not at all similar. He was completely misinformed as to the job duties. On top of all that, he was told this position was incredibly stable with a low turnover rate. The, nearly, exact opposite is true. His coworkers are conniving, outright hurtful (one of them actually called him a faggot because he mention his elbows were cracking in the dry Denver air), and refuse to train him in any way for the position he's in. 

It's become pretty clear his coworkers are already looking for a reason to get rid of him. Management is less than concerned about this. 

If we were in any other situation I would tell him to flip all of them off, cuss them out, and leave the experience off his resume. But, being that he brings in a large majority of our monthly income, we just moved half way across the country and signed a two year lease, and we're pretty broke because of it, I'm looking for a way for him to acclimate a little better. I think if he can get into the good old boys club life would become immensely easier for him. At least until he could find something comparable in pay in the area.

I have been churning out applications, resumes, and cover letters like crazy since fall semester (graduated in spring) and the best I've got was a preliminary group interview for a Software Developer I position, and a phone interview (but did not make the cut for an in-person interview...) for a Sales Management Trainee position.

I'm not too enthused about the developer position and I am positive that I do not have the programming knowledge of some other candidates and as everyone knows the Information Systems major has huge holes compared to a CS or SE degree.

Ultimately I REALLY want to get into a Sales Management Trainee position and begin chipping away at my MBA preferably in Global Business. My rejection for the Sales Management Trainee said they were going to pursue candidates whose qualifications more closely match their needs... What could I possibly be lacking for a TRAINEE position? Literally all of my work experience has required a great deal of interaction with customers/guests/clients. It wasn't a ""sales"" position, but the experience was as close to a sales position as I could get in my geographic area.

I'm living in WV right now and I'm applying for positions everywhere... Pittsburgh, Cleveland, DC, Virginia, Texas... everywhere.

Would I be better off putting my MBA goal ahead of my job search right now, then trying to find an internship in the area of the school I go to? I just feel like people are thinking I'm too qualified for a super entry-level position, not qualified enough for an actual career position, and not taking my seriously that I want to relocate and travel as much and far as possible.

* Write great cover letters that sell you as a candidate
* Address Key Selection Criteria scrupulously - 200-500 words per item, using the Situation, Action, Result model
* Use KSC to collate examples/stories to address the same points in interview (interviews often re-phrase the same points as questions)
* Apply for appropriate work - the better the fit of what you apply for the more likely you are to get it, and the better you will be at it
* Apply when you are feeling good about yourself - when I am down I don't have ANYWHERE near the same level of confidence and don't do as well.
* Be yourself in interviews - no point them hiring someone that you aren't going to be able to be all the time.
* Research the organisation well, and show that you have this knowledge, take in whatever information you can during the interview and also apply that knowledge in your answers (they LOVE this)

Management never listened to anything suggested by the staff and when things failed, they took the opportunity to declare emergencies requiring that they hire outside contractors, rather than fill vacated positions or provide adequate training. Then, when the consultants would come in and make the same recommendations as the regular staff, management would gush over them and pat themselves on the back for wisely hiring the contractors. It was soul-crushing and professionally stagnating.

My SO (of 3 years) and I are having serious difficulty getting started out of college.

We both went to engineering school, I am Mechanical and he is Chemical.  He shines on his resume - internships, 3.5 GPA, research experience, and one contract as an associate engineer.

I got a low-ball offer for a go-nowhere company in another state doing RF Engineering that uses absolutely nothing I learned in school, and have been here for 19 months.  My SO moved here with me after his contract ended in hopes of finding something or perhaps going to grad school (grad school didn't work out.)

He has been applying to approximately a dozen jobs a day, every day, for 19 months.  His resume is top notch.  He has cover letter writing down to an art.  We are very aware that every online job application gets submitted with 1000 others into the black hole of the internet.

**The problem:**

I think one of our major problems is that we have no networking.  We have exhausted all family members and friends of family members (nobody in our small family is in engineering).  We have bothered our old professors to no avail.  Most of our friends aren't working, but rather chose the ""go to grad school to ride out the recession"" tactic of life.

It seems like everybody I've talked to who has gotten a job, has gotten it via some friend or family member contact.  We have none of those.  We've heard of those young professional meetups - do those work?

And to top it all off, we totally suck at this.  I am shy in general, and my SO has issues with anxiety and talking to people.  The awkwardness of social situations is enough to make him physically ill or panic.  The idea alone of going to random meetups based on various hobbies makes me cringe.  However, we know we need to push these excuses aside and get down to business.  

**So the question is: How does a person network, starting from nothing?**

All advice appreciated.

1330998378.0,42,self.jobs,qjh0f,[Another update to] Boss threw a hissy fit.,50,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qjh0f/another_update_to_boss_threw_a_hissy_fit/,"Most of you saw this coming after I posted two weeks ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pvo7g/long_update_boss_threw_a_hissy_fit_and_humiliated/. I was fired last week.

After my last post, my ex-coworker, who I got along with really well, talked to my ex-boss. Apparently he confided in her and, without saying these words exactly, he told her that he planned to fire me later that day. He could tell by her reaction that she wasn't happy about that, and he really respects her, so after a long conversation, he agreed that he would keep me on and stick to the original plan of making me salaried with benefits. He called me into his office later that day and told me all this (although not about the nearly firing me part). We agreed to work on communicating better from there on out.

That was a week ago last Friday. I went home that day feeling like my job was safe and that my ex-boss and I were turning over a new leaf. But I was very wrong.

Now for a little more background: I was paid on an hourly basis for my probationary period. Everyone else in the office was salaried and got comp time. When I first started, my ex-boss told me he would like to ""pay"" me comp time instead of overtime as well. And because I was essentially working 2-3 previously full-time jobs, I always worked longer than 40 hours per week (which he knew about). On Tuesday, the 28th, as I was gathering employee hour totals from my coworkers to do payroll, I asked my ex-boss if I could count 8 of the 30+ hours I had saved as comp time toward the day off we had for President's Day. Everyone else in the office got holiday pay, but as I did not yet have benefits, I thought I could use my comp hours. I asked my ex-boss, and he said he would have to think about it.

The next day, Wednesday, the 28th, my boss still did not talk to me about becoming salaried. He was going on vacation beginning at noon on the 29th, so I knew I had to ask him about it again before that. He told me the week before that if he did not sign me up for insurance by March 1st, I would have to wait until August 1st. So, at the end of the day on Wednesday, I asked my ex-boss if it was a good time to chat, and he said yes. First, I asked again what he thought about me using my comp hours for President's Day. I had to do payroll the next morning at the very latest and didn't want to get paid for 72 hours instead of 80 if I had 30 hours in the bank. I didn't whine or anything--just asked. He told me no. He said that, as an hourly employee, I wasn't entitled to benefits of any kind yet, and he had been a very generous employer to tell me that I could get comp time for extra hours worked in the first place. I didn't mention overtime. It took all my energy to do this, but I swallowed my pride and moved on to my next topic: getting benefits. I asked him if there was any paperwork we would have to go over the next morning to make me salaried. He said no and that he would take care of it. He also mentioned (again) that he thought I was overpaid and that he wasn't happy about the situation at all. He cited the binder incident (http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/phau6/boss_threw_a_hissy_fit_and_humiliated_me_in_front/) as the reason he didn't think I was worth keeping on, but then he explained that he was going to take the chance anyways and hope his investment (i.e., me) would eventually pay off.

The next morning, he called me into his office and handed me a new memorandum of employment. At first I thought this might be the paperwork to make me salaried. But, oh, no, it wasn't. I was holding a contract that, if I signed, would make me a part-time, on-call introductory employee. The contract stated that I failed my introductory period (again, the only example my ex-boss had of me being a shitty employee was the binder incident) and that I would have to go through another one. And, in the meantime, work 30 hours or fewer per week. I asked my ex-boss if this was negotiable at all, and he said no, very coldly. He said I was still eligible for benefits but that I had to pay for 20% of them (while everyone else got them for free) and that, if I worked under 30 hours per week, they would be cancelled. When I asked if my hours would be cut, he said he would need me for the next month to train my admin replacement and that, afterwards, this was likely.

I told my ex-boss that I didn't think this was a part-time job and that the editing aspect alone was a full-time job. And then I mentioned that I hadn't said anything about my workload when the research analyst quit and I absorbed all her duties. He snatched the memorandum out of my hands, screamed at me that I was fired, and kicked me out. He hardly even let me pack up my belongings.

Now that I've had a few days to recuperate, I realize this was all for the best. While I'm stressed out that I'm jobless, I no longer feel like I want to die from lack of worth, which is a huge improvement. All that being said, though, I have no idea how I start my new job search because now I have to explain why my last job ended. I'm not stupid enough to use my ex-boss as a reference, but still, how do I explain getting fired? I can't trash his management style or say it was a hostile work environment without sounding like a whining quitter. And it doesn't make sense to say that I love to edit but also thought it was time to find other opportunities. So how the heck can I explain what happened? Is there a positive spin to all this that I'm missing?

On another note, I talked to a lawyer after I got fired to see if I had a case, even though I was an at-will employee. The first lawyer I talked to offered to pursue this pro bono based on the fact that my ex-boss made discriminatory comments like ""no girl your age should be making what you're making."" He also told me that I should've been getting overtime instead of comp time because I was hourly. He also dragged out of me a few other potentially illegal practices. Further, I spoke to a woman who quit while I was there, and she told me that my ex-boss has been sued numerous time by employees. But is it a terrible idea for me to pursue this? If I win, I'll be the girl who sued her last employer. If I lose, I'll be the girl who tried to sue her last employer. Either way, isn't this worse than being fired in the first place, at least in the eyes of my next employer?

Which brings me to my last question. My ex-boss hasn't yet paid me for 10 of my overtime hours. (By the way, he now admits I should've been getting paid overtime instead of comp time.) And he also hasn't paid me for any of my accrued vacation time either, which is at least another 10 hours. I gave him my hour totals the afternoon I was fired. I was smart enough to make copies of my time cards when things started getting rocky. My ex-boss said that he plans to review my hours and will pay me accordingly this week. But isn't it illegal to wait this long? Oregon law states that he has to pay me by the end of the next business day, which would've been last Friday.

Reddit, this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. If you have any idea as to what I should do next, it will be very appreciated. So far all I've done was apply for unemployment and sign up for a temp agency. Otherwise, I've hardly gotten out of bed.

1329710584.0,44,self.jobs,pxbly,Some tips from a recent graduate,50,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pxbly/some_tips_from_a_recent_graduate/,"Hi guys,

I just started my first ""real"" job after graduating in June of last year with degrees in Econ and Math. I've learned a lot from this subreddit and I thought I'd give back and share some of the things I've picked up during my job search:

1) Don't be lazy with your resume. You should constantly be looking for ways to make it better. Make sure you get feedback on it from friends and family and places like r/resumes. Keep it concise and don't make it longer than a page. Also don't send out the same generic resume to every single job posting you apply to. You really need to tweak it for every type of job you're applying for.

2) Take advantage of your contacts. Make sure that everyone you know is aware that you're looking for a job. You'd be surprised by how many people are willing to let you know if they hear of an opening. I got my current job because a friend of a friend sent in my resume. Out of the 25 or so jobs I applied to through a contact, I got 8 phone or first round interviews. Out of the 500+ random job listings I applied to online, I only received 2 phone interviews. It's MUCH easier to get an interview if you apply through a referral. Take advantage of your network!

3) Don't stay at home all day -- try to get out and do stuff. Look for places to volunteer or try to find a part-time job. The first few months after graduation I spent 90% of my time at home and I eventually started getting super depressed. There were days when I would barely get out of bed. But I eventually got a job as a server and it helped a ton. Yeah, it wasn't the most glamorous job and I occasionally had to deal with some shitty customers. But I got to feel productive and social and I ended up meeting some really cool people. I even had co-workers who were in the same situation as me (recent grad, living with parents) and it was nice having people around who could relate to me. Plus it's always nice to have some money coming in.

4) Spend as much time as you can preparing for every interview. You really need to spend lots and lots of time looking up potential interview questions, thinking about what your response should be, rehearsing your answer, etc. It's insanely hard to get an interview. But once you do you're way closer to getting the job. Don't waste the opportunity.

I really hope this helps. Good luck!",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_pxbly,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pxbly/some_tips_from_a_recent_graduate/,
1328759769.0,40,self.jobs,phau6,Boss threw a hissy fit and humiliated me in front of my coworkers.,51,11,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/phau6/boss_threw_a_hissy_fit_and_humiliated_me_in_front/,"I started working for a small firm 2.5 months ago. I love the work itself and my coworkers, but I'm not getting along as well as I'd like with the owner/director. He is very friendly with his other employees but seems very cold toward me. Even though I'm getting great feedback from coworkers about how much they value my skills, my boss only has negative things to say--despite the fact he told me he plans to make me salaried once my probationary period is up at the end of this month. 

Anyway, I was already a little worried about our working relationship, but now I feel much worse: earlier this week, we had to send out an important proposal involving two documents: one made up of four binders and another only two sheets of paper. The whole thing was very particular, and if something went wrong, it was my head because I'm in charge of production. I knew the deadline was coming up a couple weeks ago, and I'm in charge of ordering office supplies on top of my main duties, so I purchased binders and tabs and restocked the drawer of Fed Ex supplies. The day before we sent it out, I printed the eight CD labels I needed, the 12 different mailing labels--basically, I did everything I possibly could have done in order to prepare for the next day.

My boss wanted to send the document out Monday afternoon via Fed Ex even though it wasn't technically due until Wednesday afternoon. By Monday morning, I had done my part, so I waited for him to send the final document to the printer so I could start production. He finally did that around 11am, and then he left the office for two hours. During that time, I fixed the glaring errors he neglected to check for, and I assembled the document accordingly. Two hours later, everything was put together, but I ran into a slight problem: the four-binder proposal had to be sealed in its own box, separate from the two-page proposal. However, the four-binders were so bulky that my packing options were a little limited if I wanted to fit that box inside another box with the sealed envelope.

Just as I was brainstorming my options, my boss came back, looking pissed. Before he even took off his jacket, he asked me in an annoyed tone if I was finished. I told him I was but that I was about to look for another box to fit the binders in. At this point, we had 2 hours to call Fed Ex for a pickup or 3.5 if I wanted to drop it off at the store. But my boss went ballistic. He tore apart the supply closet, taking out obviously-too-small envelopes and trying to stuff four binders in them. While he was doing this, I suggested that I try to fit the binders in a medium Fed Ex box and then stuff that inside a large Fed Ex box so the two proposals could be sealed separately. (That was going to be my first step before he came in.) But he didn't listen. He kept tearing apart the office and swearing very loudly all the while. And that's when things got nasty. As he was going on his rampage, I was picking up all the ripped envelopes he threw all over the floor, and then he started screaming at me.

""You didn't prepare for this!""

""This should've been taken care of yesterday!""

""What have you been doing all week?!""

""Are you fucking crazy?!"" (This one was after I asked if we could send the two proposals separately; the guidelines only said they had to be sealed separately, not that they had to be mailed together.)

At this point, I had used up most of my energy trying not to cry and not getting defensive. And then I once again offered to try to fit the binders in the medium box first. This time he listened, and what do you know--they fit! I called Fed Ex to schedule a pickup, and all was well. However, then my boss came to my desk, told me ""You're lucky that fit,"" and then proceeded to joke about how ridiculous the proposal guidelines were with my coworker three feet away. 

He did not apologize then or since. At this point, I won't hold my breath. 

So, here's my dilemma: I want to let it all go and feel good about where I work, but ever since this incident, I have zero respect for my boss. And it's really difficult to take orders from someone you don't respect.

On a similar note, it's clear my boss doesn't respect me either. He is very friendly toward everyone else in the office, but he treats me like I'm a child. Granted, I am the youngest one in the office, the only unmarried person, and the only employee fresh out of college, but don't I deserve basic human respect? I don't need him to like me, but I want to be spoken to with common courtesy, and when something is out of my control, I don't want to be screamed at when things do not go according to plan.

So what do you think? Should I confront him about it? Move on? Any other advice? Also, what should I do if he brings this up during my review?

I just got a rejection from a job I wanted so badly. I had two interviews, I'm a perfectly qualified candidate, and one of my close friends works there and was the one who hooked me up with the opportunity.

This is another in a long LONG line of jobs I've been rejected for over the past 14 months, since being laid off from a job I loved. At every single interview and every single job opportunity I've networked my ass off and made sure I had contacts in my target organization who vouched for me and got my foot in the door. This was not easy, it involved many awkward emails and phone conversations, and me awkwardly asking people who were basically strangers to stick their neck out for me. 

I'm not complaining about jobs that I apply for online, and don't hear back from. Obviously I get why that doesn't work. But these opportunities where I'm not only well qualified, but I also have every personal ""in"" a candidate could hope for?

I have a shitty dead end job now that I hate, and I make less than I did when I was on unemployment. I just started a grad school program that I'm very excited about, it provides all sorts of great networking opportunities. But why do I feel like its all bullshit? Why isn't networking (which is the only job seeking advice people give me) working???

TL;DR - Just got turned down for the millionth time for a job opportunity in which I was well qualified, and had networked my way into a great foot in the door. If applying online anonymously doesn't work, and networking doesn't work...what does?

**EDIT: Thank you all for your advice and input. This has been a great outlet for improving myself, and for blowing off a little bit of steam. I think it's become obvious that networking is NOT bullshit, just something that is imperfect. There is no magic recipe for getting a job, and a whole lot of reality regarding tough economic times and my own personal shortcomings. I need to continue to search within my personal networks for job opportunities, and use my professional connections and graduate school to enhance my standing in the minds of potential employers. I'm not giving up, and I appreciate the support from everyone. I really REALLY look forward to the day where I can come back to this post and PM everyone who reached out to me that I got a badass job and everything is better. Thanks again.**

*EDIT 2: Well, interesting turn of events. Just last week I got contacted out of the blue from my former mentor from a job I had 3 years ago. This is a guy I've stayed close with, kept in contact, and asked for numerous recommendations. He took a new position and reached out to me to join him there. I start on Monday. I owe it all to networking (and good interviewing). Networking is NOT bullshit. Let me repeat Networking is NOT bullshit. Like anything else in life you just have to stay at it.

Should I suck it up and find a way to cope, or quit?",52,14,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/15ujed/new_job_at_call_center_is_making_my_depression/,"I'm a recent college graduate who has been looking for tech writing, copywriting, or proofreading positions for over a year. However, aside from a few freelance jobs and a few short contract positions, I haven't had much luck. After an interview for a good position was abruptly cancelled last month, I sort of ""snapped"" and did something I swore to myself I would never do: I went to a family member for help. She was able to get me a part-time position at a call center where I basically work as a telemarketer and try to push sub-par credit cards onto customers. The pay is barely above minimum wage, but with a dog-walking business I work for during the day, it's a decent amount.

The problem? I have pretty bad social anxiety and depression and this job has very quickly turned into my own personal hell. I have a particular problem with talking to people on the phone, especially when they don't want to talk to me. Every time a shift is coming up, I inevitably do a mental countdown. Twelve hours before I have to go back there, eleven, ten, etc. I get paranoid about how I handle calls and lose sleep over it. If I make a sale, it haunts me because I know I just helped them sign up for a crummy product. I've worked for customer service before, so I'm no stranger to selling services to customers, but in those cases the customer has always sought ME out. I don't feel right calling people in their homes. Sometimes when I worked at a movie theater I felt bad for pushing the large popcorn on people, but I never left work feeling like a shitty human being.

I know I'm overreacting. I know the problem isn't logical, but that doesn't stop it from existing. I haven't been this mentally down since my last year of college and my thoughts have recently taken a turn for the dark. My first instinct is to quit, but it's only been a month, I do need the money, and I don't have many other options. (Maybe I could go back to the theater...) I just don't think nine bucks an hours is worth hating my life every time I go into work. It is a somewhat transitory job and it's not uncommon for employees to leave after a few weeks or months.

I'm writing on behalf of my dad, and was hoping to get some advice on helping him to get a job. He unfortunately has three strikes against him, which have so far proved insurmountable. 

First, he's a few weeks shy of sixty. Second, he's been out of ""official"" work for about three years. I say ""official"" in quotes, as he has been trying to keep a freelance business going to try and bring in some money while he's tried to find work, but the field is just to small to support a family with. That leads to the third strike: his experience. He, for most of his professional life, has been doing small instrument repair, mostly surveying instruments. However, those have been moving more and more into the realm of the computerized, leaving fewer and fewer of the instruments he knows how to work with in circulation, and thus, fewer that need repair. The recession and drop off in construction didn't help at all, naturally. 

He has his strengths. He's good with his hands, detail-oriented, great working with other people (especially customers) and dedicated when he's working on something. But his skills are all based off of practical, on the job experience, and he hasn't had any formal education past high school.

In his three years of job hunting, he has been called to a grand total of two interviews, neither of which ever contacted him afterwards. I'm starting to give up hope that he'll ever get another job, and I think he is too. This whole situation is really killing my family. The only way that they've been able to keep from drowning is through a) my mother's disability, b) my dad's unemployment insurance (before it ran out, at least), and c) an inheiritance from my (maternal) grandfather, which they had hoped to put into a second house to rent out. That money is being eaten away, however, through living expenses and through some repairs that are really needing to be made to their current house, and the idea of a second house to help fund their retirement is just crumbling before their eyes. This is especially hard on my mom, who *can't* get a job, and is feeling more and more worried and depressed about the situation. Honestly, I'm starting to worry for their marriage a bit, with the only cold comfort being that neither on could really afford to divorce the other. It's a really, really sick feeling.

I'm doing what I can to help out. They loaned me some money a few years ago to keep me afloat when I was going through a rough patch, and I'm paying them back as quickly as I can afford to, but it's not enough. I've tried to think of ways to help them out, but I'm coming up with nothing. My dad needs a job. He needs health insurance. My family needs help, and I can't think of anything else I can do. Hopefully someone here might be able to think of something I haven't.

I'm sorry to dumping a sob story on you guys right before Christmas, but the lack of finances have taken a real toll on the the family's Christmas spirit, and sort of brought everything to a head. The general mood here is anything but festive. I just don't know what to do.

I have always given my all at work and worked my ass off. I am extremely polite to customers and have always gone the extra mile in my job.

 My latest job has not yet given me a set salary, despite  already having started work. I have talked to them about it but they admit that they do not have very much business and my salary will be likely a lot lower than industry standard. On top of being underpaid and doing my regular job duties, they expect me to grow the business so they can afford to pay me what I'm worth. The thing is, that is exactly what my last boss said.

So far the interview process has been pleasant, but what I'm reading on glassdoor tells a different story. 

A good 80% of the company's reviewers are saying the work is underpaid/overstressed and there are serious disconnects between the base workforce and management.

Now logically, it makes sense to me that glassdoor would mainly contain negative reviews...as the only people that end up on glassdoor are those who are looking for work themselves and thus dissatisfied where they currently are. But the ratio of negative/positive ratings and the low range of reported salaries for the position I'm applying for vs. other large companies in the same industry concerns me a bit.

Should this data be taken with a grain of salt, or should I accept the idea that despite having profitable earnings and a high consumer rating, the company has some serious HR issues and is not somewhere I want to report to for work every week?

I don't really have any contacts inside the company or within the field itself, so right now glassdoor is pretty much my only resource. One of the managers who gave me a phone interview described the department I was applying for as having a relatively low turnover rate (of 20% or lower in a 10 year period), but I'm having trouble believing that given the long work hours the job demands and low salaries/ratings reported on glassdoor.

Now, I've only been here for about 6 weeks, but a job at a competing company in town in the same business opened up that is just a bigger, better job.

The interview went down and I told my boss afterwards, and he was understandably upset.

1) The job is great for me because I'd be dealing more with people I connect strongly with.

2) I am intimidated by one portion of the job that is kind of ""behind the scenes.""

3) I don't want to burn any bridges. I took the job I have now saying I expected to be here for more than a year, but 6 weeks in this opportunity arises. I didn't plan on it. Both are great companies, but where I am now owns more of where I WANT to be down the line. The possible job offer would help me build the skills to get there faster, but would probably reflect poorly on me for leaving like this.

I seriously have no idea what to do or how I got here. The conversation with my boss (who is out of town all weekend, so we can't discuss it all) really rocked my confidence.

I've been on here for sometime trying to draw some comfort. I'm ~1 year our of college so not seasoned and already on my 3rd job. I was basically laid off twice (amazing luck). My new job may be temporary but at least it's something.

I've learned a lot about job hunting after doing it so much. 1st job was 100+ applications. 2nd job ~90. This job ~80. I am not an engineer or a comp sci major. People never begged me to work for them when I graduated. Job hunting IS a full time job with overtime.

So what I've learned or at least what's worked for me!

* One size fits all resumes and cover letters work. I've spent about half an hour before customizing cover letters and never received a response ever.
* Following up 1 week later works. Yes, people actually do forget about you, and it isn't always cause you aren't worth speaking to. I've been interviewed by places that needed to be bothered.
* Stalking people works. Can't get a company to talk to you? Stalk their employees on Linkedin! I don't mean creepily but generally showing interest in a company. Plus you're getting to know people in your field. All you awkward penguins can at least email right?
* Keeping very good records of who you contacted and when will help you so much. I have a giant spreadsheet (which is why I can give accurate numbers on the jobs I've applied to) on who I've contacted. I don't accidentally end up emailing the same company, I know when 1 week has passed to follow up, and I can keep track of out comes of each application. This was very helpful when I needed to job hunt again.. and again. The places I applied to fresh out of college that ignored me now answered me!
* Spam works. Find every company you'd be willing to work for and send your resume any way you can. People of course are best. I have yet to work somewhere that posted an opening! That's right! None of my jobs have had openings listed. I just used google and went at it. Eventually someone says yes.

* Sometimes it is honestly a blessing if you lose you job. No like seriously. Straight out of college it really is take what you can get. I didn't start out making much. It took a few months before I could live comfortably. Changing jobs is the fastest way to make more money by asking for more at your next position. Best part is you aren't a job hopper because it isn't your fault you were laid off.

tl;dr: Generic cover letters, following up, stalking, spam and crazy record keeping help the job hunt so much. ",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_yqh45,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yqh45/job_hunting_success_advice_inside_since_this_is/,

i was on the phone with my car insurance company regarding a hike in rates, and explained (essentially) ""i understand it looks like smaller payments if i break it down to monthly, but in the long term that's more expensive and i'm going to be unemployed shortly - but i need the car to run legally and inexpensively so i can find a new job."" (i live in an area where public transit is not an option and the only things in walking distance won't pay near as much as my current office job.)

upon hanging up, unsolicited advice of **""*don't tell them you're unemployed*""** was given - why the hell not? my credit is awesome, they can check my work history for reliability, but i need someone to understand that i can't pay Y amount when i only have X coming in right now. nevermind the rudeness of your ""ear hustling"" in the first place... now, if i'm looking for quotes, i'm putting in that i'm employed (because i am, for another week), but i wanted to know if there was anything that could be done with my existing account on that front. i'm not saying i'm doing this with every facet of my life (hell, my doctor tried to help by giving me 3 monthly prescriptions at a time instead of once a month - but the health insurance denied it, must do mail-in, blah blah), but there are a few key ill-timed payments due right now!

Even in r/jobs there's different opinions and stories of what's worked in the past for specific individuals, but the fact of the matter is there's no cut and dry way to get any job, just like there's no one way to find a good boyfriend (or girlfriend). Different hiring managers look for different things and what works for one department, job or person won't work for the next.

So what's a job seeker supposed to do? After a while you start questioning every little move. Was my cover letter not personal enough? Not professional enough? Was there someone out there willing to work for $1 less per hour than me? If that interview went so well, why aren't they calling? Did I fidget too much? Was I too eager? Did I come off as desperate? Did they NOT LIKE ME enough?

It's enough to turn a smart, dedicated and positive job seeker into a crazy person. Luckily, I'm fully employed in a position that's allowing me to pad my resume quite a bit, but I've hated the company pretty much since starting (only took it because I was desperate for a full time job) and have been in various stages of the job hunt for years. It's draining. And all the advice out there can be confusing. 

I feel like this is how people who really want a relationship feel like. I already found a wonderful person to be with, but I don't think I'll find a job the same way I found him (which, interestingly enough, was at a job I didn't like too much... so I guess good things come from sucky jobs too). 

Thanks for the vent. Been on the hunt for a long time now and sifting through all the different pieces of advice of what's worked for so-and-so doesn't get easier. If the economy wasn't so shitty and I wasn't so lucky to even have the job I have I'd have quit a long time ago, but honestly I'm tired of just taking a job to have a job.

1338142149.0,39,self.jobs,u7ij1,Exit interviews - where's the line between being honest and burning bridges?,40,1,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/u7ij1/exit_interviews_wheres_the_line_between_being/,"I am about to put in my two weeks notice this coming week after being with a very miserable group of a large company for almost two years. I've been nothing but polite and obedient while there, but I'm ready to let it all out. Problem is, being a professional, I don't want to be burning bridges already. However, I'd like to be honest so upper management can see the group has major issues.

Points I would like to touch on in the exit interview:

* The annual review system is flawed. I was told by my manager ""We do not give out Exceeds Expectations ratings unless you're getting promoted"". What's my incentive to give EE-level performance if I know I will not get the proper acknowledgement?
* Lack of proper feedback. I was not told about any areas needing improvement verbally or in writing in my review yet I only received the minimum increase. I cannot develop professionally without proper feedback on how to better myself within the company.
* No respect for our personal lives. Vacation requests submitted 30 days in advance as required by group policy were frequently lost or forgotten about. I've received phone calls on days of my personal time off asking where I was, despite having submitted the request 30 days ago and reminding the group I will be off during the weekly meeting.
* Unprofessional atmosphere. The managers frequently gossip about others loudly and indiscreetly in the office or in foreign languages they think we do not understand. This creates an unprofessional and uncomfortable working environment.
* Disregard for safety. Safety is not emphasized with the field personnel and individuals have been discouraged from submitting Near Miss incident reports by management.

What do you guys think? What can be worded differently or should be omitted? Should I be honest but possibly make enemies? Or should I just be quiet and let the group continue their downward spiral?

EDIT: I am also considering not writing any of this in the exit interview and keeping it cordial (our exit interview is an online form). But instead, speak verbally with the HR rep, particularly about the safety issue and unprofessional atmosphere. Do you guys think that would be better than doing so in writing?

****
Thanks for all the excellent input. I'm now considering being cordial in the exit ""interview"" (online form) and sitting down with the HR rep for 20 minutes. Many people here brought up the good point that 1) They haven't changed for 20+ years so why would they change now? And 2) They probably won't listen to me anyway. But they points I DO want to mention verbally to HR are:

1. Safety. Other departments and the company as a whole promote reporting incidents and close calls at all possible opportunities to make others aware of potential dangers. I can't believe I heard first hand a manager telling a tech to NOT fill out a report for a very minor incident. That is an absolute disregard for the well being of the staff and encouragement of safe habits.

2. The gossiping and public crap-talking by managers. It's a hostile environment suit waiting to happen.

When you go down to the second tier you find two sites that aggregate from many others. Indeed.com and simplyhired.com are very similar from my experience and I have had success with both. 
A step down from these two sites are monster.com and careerbuilder.com. They have a huge number of job postings but rarely lead to anything substantial. At the very bottom we have craigslist.com. I have a feeling many people will disagree with this but that is just my opinion.

Four years ago, I left a steady job to follow my passion for literature. I attended a top MFA program, met some great people, and went $40,000 into debt. After graduation, I moved back home to revise the novel I turned in as my thesis. Sadly, the project turned out to be a failure.


Now I feel stuck. And a bit overwhelmed.


My parents have been great about supporting me, but it's time to move on. I want to find a career and pay off these loans. I want a place of my own.


Unfortunately, I'm facing a few obstacles:


* I don't know what I can do, job-wise, with my degree. Teaching is an option -- but it's notoriously difficult to find a teaching gig without having published a novel. Copywriting is another option -- but I don't know how to break into the field. I don't have job experience or a portfolio.


* Because I want to continue writing fiction on weeknights, I'm not interested in a job that demands one work in excess of forty hours per week. This includes ""entertaining clients"" after hours.


* To avoid compounding my student debt, I don't want a job that demands additional schooling.


Any ideas?

I had been living with my parents for four years after college.  The only job I could find four years ago was down the road from their house.  Parents, mercifully, agreed to let me live with them for a few years ($300 rent, though) so I could save some money.  I actually managed to pay off my student loan debt in that time.  I am now debt free.

But I think I might have fucked myself over, career-wise, by accepting a low-skill, low-wage position and staying there as long as I did.   I was doing data entry for an HR department.  Did a few other HR things for the department, nothing major.  Got only a few feel-good, cosmetic ""promotions.""  Was hired at $28K, left at $32K.

It was at a big media company that I thought would look nice on my resume.  I was hoping they'd hire me to be an entry-level writer or editor.  They had one or two such openings each year.  But, for reasons beyond my control (my boss and I didn't get along; boss was in charge of all hiring for the company), that didn't work out.  So I left.  Didn't want to live at home anymore, anyway.  So here I am.

I've taken this new job through a family connection.  It's more data entry/filing, this time in a giant file room for a law firm.  This scares me.

Am I setting myself up for doom by accepting a job for less money and no hope for new skills or advancement?  It's not actually working for the law firm but rather a contractor that handles their paperwork.  The hiring manager said I was overqualified and hinted at the fact that they're eventually looking for a supervisor of the department—but I don't want to be a fucking supervisor of the filing room.

I was making $32K at my previous job.  Now I'll be making $31K.  I was lucky to find an apartment-share for $650/month, which is about a third of my take-home salary, which is nonetheless really good for NYC.  (Many people pay half or more.)  But it's still a shitty ratio.  I'd love to be in the quarter-of-monthly salary territory.  I'd love to also make above $40K someday.  Oh, to dream….

On a positive note, I like my new roommates.  My new 25-minute commute also makes me happy.  And living in the city, finally, after numerous false starts, also makes me very happy.

I just don't know how I'm ever going to do to get out of this low-wage, low-skill cycle.  I feel like I have no way out, like I'll never be able to make enough to feel secure or feel like I'm moving in a good ""career path"" direction, never mind feeling fulfilled and like I'm doing something I enjoy.  What do I do?

1.) How long should I stay there for my own good, career-wise?  Would it look bad if I left after a month or three months if (by some miracle) I got something better?
2.) How much time, if any, do I ""owe"" this new firm without reflecting negatively on my family connection—my stepmother—who got me this job?  This required some string-pulling on her part.  (She called up HR and, in her words, ""begged"" them to offer me a job.)  She is not a lawyer or higher up.  She's just a secretary in their back office.  She assures me that ""they're watching and will look out"" for me.  But I'm skeptical.  This job is technically off-site.  It's in the basement.  I won't be interacting with the lawyers or anyone in the company.  And to be honest, I have no interest in being a lawyer or paralegal.  The hiring manager pretty much knows this and still hired me (he knows my step-mom and likes her a lot).
3.) What the fuck else is out there for me?  I'm lost and terrified.  I feel like I have no marketable skills.  The only things I'm good at besides writing, thinking analytically and researching (woohoo, liberal arts degree) is photocopying, collating, VLOOKUP on Excel, eating shit, showing up on time, and using the numeric keypad to enter strings of numerals into a machine.
4.) What resources are out there in NYC?  Anyone know a good career coach or networking group or something?
5.) Time for grad school?  Having another degree gets you more money, I know from my previous position in HR.",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_162gvw,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/162gvw/about_to_take_a_job_for_less_money_no_hope_for/,

I was hired out of school to work at a top bank where I spent 3 months working and the last month and a half going through rigorous training. On a training exam I scored an 86% after tons of preparation – a couple days later I had a meeting about it, VP said “this is Herpderp Bank, you can’t just scrape by in my group with an 86.”  This test score wasn’t the red herring for another issue in any way and my boss was honest about it. I worked hard and shouldered a lot of responsibility for my team, was on very friendly terms with everyone, and other than having a disappointing test score (I guess an “A” was where the bar was set) I was fired within my first 3 months. : (

I’ve been on several interviews since this occurred 5 months ago, and I feel like despite having a great resume at great companies, everything on paper about my last job is a BIG red flag to my next employer, even though it is completely undeserving. It didn’t used to worry me as much, but now that I’ve been unsuccessfully applying and interviewing for 5 months straight to no avail I feel like I need to change my strategy.

My last job, and why I left is a substantial talking point in any interview. No interviewer wants to hear more than a minute of excuses on the topic even if they are valid. How would you handle this talking point in an interview if you were in my shoes?

I was hired as a 6 month contractor in November 2011 at a large company (it was my first job out of college, I was ecstatic). After 4 months I spoke with my manager about going full-time. She explained that there wasn't headcount for FT, but I could contract another 12 months and they would work and get the headcount by the end and I would be converted when my contract expired. I accepted because I enjoy my work and contracting wasn't bad.


Fast-Forward to last September, I asked my manager how the process was going, and she said they were working on it, and it seemed very promising, and I shouldn't look for work elsewhere. Then same thing in December, that I didn't need to worry. Then again in January and February the exact same thing. 


Note that I was told my contract would be 18 months total and I couldn't contract after that by company policy; so I would have to convert by mid May.


Come March my manager tells me that the company is in a hiring freeze, they have been all along. And that there will be no chance of headcount coming before my contract is up. But that there is a second option, where I become something called ""Casual Ongoing"", basically a different type of contractor. The plan is to go to that until September when the hiring freeze is ending, then I can convert to FT


Though I'm not happy, I have no other options and say I'll take it and extend my time until I can convert; it's better than nothing. 


Beginning of April rolls around and I find out my contract was only through the end of April, not mid May. And then later that the casual ongoing is not even approved by HR. It's just an idea they had heard of, but it's far from a sure thing.


Now I am two weeks away from my last day of my contract, and it appears I will not be extended in any form, despite repeatedly being told I would be. I have had interviews elsewhere, but I don't have a job lined up. 


I have been told that my bosses boss didn't try very hard to get anything done, and that converting me was never really a possibility. So it sounds like I was just told this so I would work harder. 


Big Rant, but I trusted the company to tell me the truth, but they lied to me straight up.

The really short version of the story is that I was recruited by this firm from another job where I was very successful with the promise of training and advancement. I did want to move forward in my career and felt somewhat stuck at my old job.

Instead of training I was just given a ton of work and expected to figure it out by myself. When I did ask questions I was always told to go ask someone else. I felt like a human pingpong ball.  I was starting to get it, but not quickly enough to please my bosses.  I was never given any formal warnings or feedback on how to improve my performance, but I knew it wasn't going great.  Also the company culture was awful and I dealt with all sorts of inappropriate comments and behavior on a daily basis (my boss threatened to spank me, made comments about women, etc.).  I worked there just over 9 months. I was already looking casually because I hated it so much, but wanted to stay there long enough for my employment history not to be messed.

Last week, I went for an interview for a senior admin role at a new, very small, elite university. Ten minutes into the interview, they realised I was too over-qualified but perfect for another role they’re trying to fill as a career adviser/counsellor. This completely floored me as this was a role that I’d been seriously considering over the past few months. When they showed me the job spec, it was pretty much my dream job: chance to teach, help young people, carry out research, etc. It seems too good to be true. And the salary is at the very top of my expectations.

Went for a 2nd interview a few days later and totally aced it. Got great feedback from the first interviewer how she really liked me and thought I would fit perfectly with their team. I was on cloud nine! I still have two more interviews with the company though, and this is why I’m in need of advice. The first is with the CEO and a senior manager later this week and a 2nd one with the convenor of a professional skills course next week who the successful candidate will be working closely with. 

The recruiter just called though and said there’s some concerns about my lack of ‘real world’ work experience. Essentially, they see that I’ve worked for 2 years as a Research Analyst for a commercial real estate brokerage (i.e. agents buying/selling office building and helping clients with leases) and 2 years in the construction industry (as an office manager). They’re ideally looking for people with ‘broad experience in the working world, possibly in the financial sector’.

I’ve already begun formulating responses regarding my experience with students (I taught over 350 undergraduate seminars + I have tons of experience counselling and mentoring youngsters) and the fact that I have lots of office experience under my belt.

Reddit this is my dream job and I’m so close. How can I convince senior management that I have what it takes, even though I’m not an investment banker or financial analyst.

**TL;DR – Interviewing for my dream job but the client is concerned about my lack of relevant and amount of work experience. How do I convince them to hire me?**

Edit - thanks for all the very useful feedback. I'll incorporate much of what you say into my preparation. Things just got a little more pressurized though a few hours ago. The recruiter tells me they now want a state in support of my application, explaining in detail (well...one single page) how my previous work experience is of value to them. I'm going to use an old cover letter and lay out all my reasons for why I should be hired. It's frustrating because the client originally told the recruiter they want people with HE experience (check) but oh yeah can they also have this and this and this. On the plus side, the HR manager really likes me and seems to be really supporting my application. If I get this job (or whenever I get a decent job), I'll be sure to post my job hunting experience on here. What a roller coaster ride its been. Anyways, thanks for the comments. It's reassured me I'm not in this thing by myself.

-Looking for work since June, graduated in Dec 10 with a B.A. in Econ.

-Have related experience 3+ years while a full time student.

-Been applying to positions varying from analyst, economist, marketing/advertising, controller etc.

-Most local places wouldn't give me the light of day and then a huge global company gives me a mock project to analyze/present and flies my across the US on their dime as part of the interview process. Honestly you never know, all of these places are so different.


**My tips:**

-Have a standardized resume, give one line explaining your job duties and the rest being accomplishments. Clean design and ALWAYS send it as a pdf if possible.

-Have a standardized cover letter, bullet points of your credentials at a glance and relating them to the position description and mention how you would like to interview and explain what you can do for their company.

-Use resume paper, I use Southworth cream 18lb or 24lb available on amazon.

-I'm gonna be frank and some people might not like this, but I think if a place is interested in you they're going to be all over you, like next day calling or a couple of days depending on the size of the company. I've sent countless resumes and cover-letters and some places just aren't going to give you a chance. It sucks, but it is reality. I was overqualified or had ideal credentials for places and never heard a word. If you have to pursue a place for a chance that is a bad sign in my eyes.

-Practice your interview answers, and by that I mean know how you are going to respond or think about your answers beforehand. If you went through the process like I did you'll hear the same questions over and over. Don't practice it in front of a mirror you creep.

-HR people are good at faking in interviews, they've faked their way to the top, don't judge how well your interviews went, you're wasting your time.

-Fuck Taleo applications, these are the places where you sign in with an individual login for each company and fill out the same standardized application with job history/education and it takes like 30 minutes. I've gotten 0 calls back from places with Taleo implementation.

-Use indeed.com sort by date, and don't use craigslist.

-Job market is tough right now, these places want experience without paying for it. If you're a young cat like me sometimes you're competing with people who are very overqualified but have hit tough times in this economy. Do 3-4 applications a day. If you spend your whole day applying and don't hear back you're going to get depressed, keep busy doing something else. Just keep applying regularly.

1313378620.0,38,self.jobs,jj007,I’m 23 and I am miserable at my job. What are my options?,42,4,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jj007/im_23_and_i_am_miserable_at_my_job_what_are_my/,"The title is a pretty basic TL;DR. For the details, read on.

I’m 23 years old, and I’m a full-time data entry clerk. The pay is modest, but the job is stable and includes benefits, paid vacation, etc. Sounds ideal, especially in times like these and for someone my age. I was unemployed for more than a year before I landed this job, so I am infinitely grateful for what I have now.

But I hate, hate, *hate* this job and everything about it. I am watching myself become cynical and bitter and wretched, and the root it is my job. My family and social lives are fine, but this job is destroying my soul.

Part of the problem is that I still live with my parents, and I desperately want to move out. I could probably afford it (with a little sacrifice), even though I live in the NYC suburbs and housing is absurdly expensive. But my commute now is about 10 minutes each way, and it seems senseless to start paying my own rent when my present accommodations are so near my workplace. (This isn’t just a rationalization, I promise – I really do want to move out. But I’m frugal to a fault, and it strikes me as a senseless expense.)

I’ve been sending out résumés for months and have already used up all my personal days (and one of my sick days) on interviews that led nowhere. I wouldn’t dream of outright quitting this job unless I have another reliable prospect, but I don’t know how to make room for a productive job search when I’m already working full time – e.g., what do I tell my boss if I need to miss work for an interview? I don’t want to burn any bridges or raise suspicions at the office, even though I plan to escape as soon as the opportunity arrives.

So, what can I do? I embrace the chance to “pay my dues” in the interest of gaining some future advantage, but this job is a dead end. This is a company I don’t want to work at, in an industry I don’t want to be in, in an office in the middle of the suburbs – and I hate being a domestic suburbanite at 23. And “data entry clerk” on my résumé isn’t going to open any doors in my preferred industry, so it seems like every day I spend here is just a day of wasted youth. I’m a bright, competent, ambitious guy, I have a bachelor’s degree with numerous honors (though the degree is in English – a poor choice, looking back), but I feel trapped.

Pardon me if I sound melodramatic; I’m sitting here Sunday night realizing that as soon as I hit the pillow, the next moment I’ll be conscious will be when my alarm clock goes off in the morning, and it’s a dreadful prospect. Any advice (or condolences) is much appreciated.

**EDIT:** I'm tempted to go down the line and personally thank everyone who responded, but that's a little silly. So, let this be a catchall thank you to everyone who's written back. I'm grateful for the sympathy, the encouragement, and the assorted other sentiments, and I am heartened to learn that other people have the same problem I have.",,False,,t5_2qhnd,True,,,True,t3_jj007,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jj007/im_23_and_i_am_miserable_at_my_job_what_are_my/,

No one seems to be unemployed like I am.  

I've had about 10 interviews in the last month, with an active apartment lease at the school for a few months despite graduating and dwindling funds.  

I got turned down by a ton of companies in a variety of finance and management positions, including Pepsi, Macy's, ATT, etc.  I've even made it to final rounds with some banks that ended up turning me down (Deutsche Bank, etc).  

As of right now, I have nothing going on.  I landed an interview for apple store position and it is set for in 3 weeks.  

It seems like I'm exhausting my options.  Any advice to keep going?  


EDIT:  

I am currently volunteering right now. 

I didn't do much in terms of internships and stuff, I essentially held a regular job at a movie theater for a year or two in college, and I volunteered at a job in Orlando to learn the ins and outs of a business for one summer.  But I don't know how much that can help, and if it still counts as experience.  The manager will still vouch for me


EDIT 2:  

It also doesn't help that scumbags who land the jobs tend to try to rub it into those with us who are still searching.  I feel as if HR tends to pick douchebags, only one bank that turned me down can I say made a fair hiring decision from what I was able to see.  

I'm not being sour either, I feel as if HR overlooks alot of qualified candidates (not just myself) and picks those that are not as capable.  From personal experience, I found that retail recruiters love to hire the dumb blonde stereotype.

We pay salary plus commission, our top sales rep makes about 2K+ a month, and the other one who is leaving make around 1.8-1.9K a month without really trying (since she's leaving). We are a small firm with one office and good space. We have nice desks and computers, and the office environment is clean. 

So, we put out a job ad on craigslist (maybe not the best place?), we specifically put that Sales Experience is required. We get about 15 resumes, and two candidates we like. We call, no answer. Leave a voicemail. Now it's day two, call again, leave a voicemail for both, *again*. No response.

We have spots to fill, but it's either no one answers their telephone, or they don't show up for their interviews. Back in february we were hiring, we set up 14 interviews, and only 3 showed up. Seriously! I don't understand, is it that people make more money on unemployment? People don't want to work? What is it? This is so infuriating. I see here everyone looking for jobs, and I'm thinking, ""WTF? Why can't I find these people."" We offer a salary, be-it small, but the commission is the cake. I think that's what scares people off. 

Is it my ad? What is it? I honestly do not understand, should I list my ad on career-builder?

EDIT: I apologize in advance if this is the wrong place to post this. 

EDIT 2: Okay I get it, it seems like lousy pay. But we do offer incentives, bonuses etc. I guess I should have mentioned that. Some of the feedback here is informative, but some of it almost seems personal. This is not to offend anyone. I would appreciate constructive criticism, but on average our sales force is making $15.00-$17.00/hour. 
9-5 with an hour lunch, Mon-Fri. Saturdays optional. 

EDIT 3: To add, this industry has suffered as it has become more and more competitive and there are companies out there doing this for next to nothing. 5 years ago when I was working for someone doing this, my take home was around $3K after taxes, but over the past 3 1/2 years since we opened up, I've had to keep up with my competitors doing jobs for a $50 profit. Fly-by night companies coming to steal clients and shutdown shortly after. It's hard to compete and at the same time offer great pay. I would need to have rockstars of a salesforce to keep up. When doing the interviews I'm brutally honest because I don't want to waste my time, or theirs with training, I tell them, ""It's rough in the beginning because you don't have a pipeline built up. You should expect $1600 your first month with 30 jobs"". Our reps close around ~45 a month and gets to and above $2100-2300/month.

My ad simply states 'salary plus commission'. No mention of $$$$ amount. My top sales person is the only salesperson right now of 2, which may be a reason that's the only example I have at the moment. I started this company to get rid of what my employers were doing to me. Raking in the cash and not offering incentives. But being the employer I see that they did what they had to do.

I wouldn't have even said anything about it, only she mentioned it to me herself, and said ""I didn't know how else to refer to you."" 

Thinking that she needed clarification about my job title, I said that in the future correspondences, I would prefer to be referred to by my job title, which is Office Manager. She thanked me for my input, and for letting me know about my preference, and I thought the matter done, congratulating myself for having a boss open to feedback. She's been great while training me, complimenting me on how quickly I picked things up and generally being positive and upbeat.

Friday morning, she called me into her office and said that what I did was insubordination, and that I could not speak to her like that, because she was the owner of the company. She said that I did not deserve the title of Office Manager, as I was only doing half the duties of the position. (I am still in the 60-day probationary period for the position). She said that I didn't even have a car (which was NOT one of the requirements for the position. I was even upfront about that fact, and she said herself that it would not be a problem). She said that there was no room in the company with someone with an ego problem, and if I couldn't get an attitude adjustment over the weekend, then I could just not show up to work next week. She then sent me home early, like a disobedient kid, because she couldn't get caught up on work while worrying and thinking about if she offended me. 

There were other red flags before this-- they advertised an $18 hourly rate for the position, but said that because I was inexperienced with the software they were using at work, they were only comfortable offering me $16. I agreed to the decrease in pay, because they said that they would increase it after thirty days depending on how quickly I picked up the software (I wrote this in my job acceptance email, and she agreed to this). I was supposed to have an informal job evaluation on Friday, but she sent me home and said that we would have a formal job evaluation next week instead, should I decide to come back. Obviously I no longer feel confident asking for the two dollars, even though I've mastered the software, and I also no longer feel like I have any job security, because if she feels like she can fire me by asking to be called by the job title they hired me for, how is she going to react when I fuck up bigtime, like with the spreadsheets or software?




TL;DR - Boss is an insecure, underqualified micromanager with shitty communication skills who nearly fired me over a non-issue. Have savings, can quit job, but would like to keep it. Should I stay or should I go? 

Any advice on how to conduct myself during the performance review also appreciated. And if anyone could clear up whether or not what I did was actually insubordination, that'd be great too thanks. 



**EDIT 5/5/2013 1:27AM:** I do have an escape route, you guys! I'm not planning on burning through all my savings. I only accepted this job because it had more flexible hours than my old job (which was a 9 to 5, the hours for my current job are 7:00-3:00), which I needed because I was taking a 12-week Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) course, which finishes three weeks from now. I already have a job offer lined up with the organization that's been training me. 

I'm about 90% sure about giving her my resignation on Monday. It's not that I can't work with her-- she's made it very clear (by sending me home early and preventing me from doing my job) that *she* can't work with me. I'll put in writing: ""Although I would have liked to give you two weeks notice, as stated in the company's employee manual, but because you said last Friday that if I felt that I wasn't a good fit for the position, I could leave next week, I've decided to take your advice and resign from my position, effective immediately.""

I'm almost positive that I'm getting fired in two hours.,48,11,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vznwu/well_shit_im_almost_positive_that_im_getting/,"I'm in sales.  Have been for years.  I've only ever gotten fired from one job and it was because I walked out.

I had a lousy Q3 last year and had a bum month in April.  Got the talk in May, but did spectacular that month.  Also did well in June on my services goal and grew a lot of my business, but missed a $15k product goal by $1000.  The boss has been sulking around all day and won't look at me.  I've got a prescheduled development meeting in an hour and a half.

Well, back to the drawing board.  Maybe it's time for a forcible career change.

Edit: Disaster averted!  For now ..

Edit 2: Sorry to keep people hanging.  No firing today.  No firing tomorrow or next week either it doesn't seem.

I sell for a regional IT firm that has grown during my tenure from a smallish operation that was based in our metro area to a statewide operation with a focus on the western half of one of the larger states in the union.  I'm a slave to two masters, so to speak, in that we're a dual proprietorship with one owner being more technically minded and the other being focused on outreach and sales.

For most of my tenure, the technically minded owner has been away working on special projects and I've been under the charge of the other owner.  The sales minded owner has been in the mode of business development and growth and by the time that the technical owner was back on the scene, the business had grown to its current size and had the inevitable problems that accompany a medium sized business acting like a ma and pa shop, namely inefficient systems and a lack of direction.

Because of these problems, the technical owner has been clamping down on all aspects of the business in order to try to reign in the issues and has had a sort of 'off with their heads' mentality when it comes to employees that aren't meeting expectations.

My story is this:  I had missed three consecutive months of goals last July, August, and September.  This was after being hired the previous October and being handed a book of recently acquired business (acquired by acquisition, if that doesn't seem redundant to anyone) at the end of my first quarter with the company, Q4 2010.  Most of these clients had been neglected by the previous business (people don't sell super successful businesses for cut rates, after all) and required a lot of hand holding to get back into the fold.  Unfortunately, they also raised my recurring revenue to a point where the systems said that my personal goals should be raised.  The problem arose when the next quarter came and due to the intensive management that the new clients had required, my funnel wasn't full and my sales never came.  Hence a bum third quarter.

Flash forward to March of this year.  Our largest client (or my largest client) of the acquired clients (as well as my overall largest) has a major equipment failure on our watch and we have to again manage their transition to a different kind of system.  The recovery from the disaster and the engineering of the plan to move to a new system takes the better part of March to complete.  In early April I sell the project, which is very, very heavy on services but extremely light on product.  In that month I triple my services goal because of it, but the product goal is far from where it needs to be, based also on the content of the project.

In May, once the previous month's numbers are in, I have my scheduled development meeting and am told that because of the missed product goal that I will be let go if I don't meet all goals for the remainder of the quarter.

I missed my product goal by about $1k.  This didn't seem like a big deal at the time since the service goals were more than there and that's keeping all of the delivery folks working.  My boss came in sulking, wouldn't speak more than a few words to me and generally seemed like he was avoiding me.  I also knew that our scheduled follow up to the ultimatum meeting was today, so a put two and two together and figured that I was being canned.  While this was unfair, I knew that I hadn't lived up to all of my expectations and they were within the right to make the call.

Well, after this was written, I nicely confronted my boss and asked him whether we were still scheduled to have our meeting today.  He surprised me by saying that we would need to move it to Thursday to accommodate the pre-holiday busyness.  I responded to this by asking him what his opinion of my previous two month's performance was and we had a fairly brief, but involved conversation covering it and he made it very clear that he was happy with my progress and that, while there was a steep road ahead, he had no plans to let me go in the near future.

While I'm irked that the sort of thought that prompted this post was the kind of thought that I was having in this circumstance, I'm also relieved that I won't have to look for another job for the time being.

I’m sure you have loads of resumes and cover letters to sift through so I’ll keep this brief. I saw your posting on [job site] looking for [job title] and I’d like to throw my hat in the ring.

I’m an account  executive. A good one.

But we both know the real trick is to find just the right personality fit; just the right person to service your client. Hopefully that’s me. 

I’m bright, motivated, creative, intelligent and outspoken in a no-holds-barred-but-you-still-like-me kind of way. I’m one of the few people who still values integrity, honesty and character. I can treat a client to a nice dinner, hold a thoughtful conversation and close a deal, then go home and tweet, Facebook and post on Reddit about the latest Tigers score. I know what SMH, FTA and MT mean, and how to dance to Gangnam Style. 

So. There it is.

I’d love to hear about your agency culture, the clients who need an account person, and the amazing work being produced by [Company name]. If you think I might be a fit, let’s talk more.

I originally applied for the position over a month ago and after contacting tons of people in the company just to find an HR person (because nobody was replying back), I manage to get in contact with  the recruiter. There's an informal phone interview and then I land a case study/test type thing. Which I apparently failed.

I don't get any feedback on my writing and can't figure out why I failed but that's not even what's bothering me; What bothers me is that I thought I was such a good fit and (almost) everything in the job description pertained to my previous experience that I thought I would be a shoe-in. I also had confidence in my writing, at least enough that I thought I'd get to another interview phase. 

But I received the rejection email today and the whole thing is done. I had already visualized leaving my current company and working on newer, greater things. It's extremely rare that I find another opportunity like this and I feel like crap because I put all my eggs into one basket. Now, I can't even find any energy to look for other jobs because they all seem pale in comparison.

I tell this as a warning to others in the same situation who may feel pressured into accepting an offer that is not right for them. 

It was in May of last year and I'd just graduated from college with a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. I had already been looking for jobs for about a month before the recruiter from Insight Global contacted me. I hadn't had a lot of luck with interviews and was beginning to become nervous about the situation. I was getting interviews, but receiving no offers.

She vaguely described the position mostly just stating its title and asked for my information. I responded in kind and didn't hear back from her for a couple of weeks. I had many other interviews and resumes out at the time and it was easy to lose track. 
The position was for the build team which meant fixing build breaks all day long which I wasn't overly excited about so it fell to the back of my mind. 

Two weeks later, I get a call from her and she sets up a phone interview, and then an in-person interview. When I arrived for the in-person interview she informed me they had a mix up with their system and had sent the wrong candidate before, which is what I assume the two week delay was about. 
I proceed with the interview, they ask me one brain teaser from the Sunday paper, I figure it out, and that was that. I was a little disturbed since I had heard Microsoft interviews were supposed to be difficult and yet this was the easiest interview I had had since graduating. Red flag #1.  
After the interview she called me on the phone asking how I thought the interview went. She then asked if she could accept the offer on my behalf ... I said no. Red flag #2. 
A day or so later she calls saying that Microsoft would like to hire me and if I would accept their offer. So far, I hadn''t been informed of the exact compensation, I knew it was a contract position, but little else. I had lots of questions about benefits and wanted to get them answered before I signed any contracts. She gave me a phone number to call was forwarded to her manager and thats when I found out the truth...

I was to be a contractor employed by Insight Global to do work for Microsoft. The pay was $17 an hour, no paid time off, no health benefits, with the contract to be ""reviewed"" in 6 months. I wanted some time to think about my options and asked to see written documents. They refused to provide them, I asked for the weekend to think about it, and they refused to give it to me. They wanted me to accept the offer over the phone right then and there. They were trying to bully me into accepting this position and I knew it. I declined their offer. 
The next day I received this email from the recruiter:

&gt;I just got a chance to talk with my account manager and understand you have declined the opportunity with Microsoft under Bob’s team. I have to say I am disappointed with the nature of the situation. A lot of time and consideration was taken out on our and Bob’s end to get you an interview. To even get an interview with Microsoft right out of college is a very grand opportunity. When it comes to rate, it is not negotiable after the interview process, this is why we talk about it at the beginning. I appreciate the questions that you had but for future reference those are things to ask before the whole interview process even begins. It looks bad on our part to present a candidate to a hiring manager only to have them try and then negotiate terms, especially when they have already been discussed. This is not only unprofessional but is good to know for your knowledge when interviewing in the future. I do hope you take this experience and find a position that is suitable for you. Have a good weekend and the best of luck!

Obviously she was upset. I come to find out that there was a limited amount of time that Insight Global had to fill a particular position for Microsoft and because of their error with the first candidate they were now completely out of time. Which is why they refused to let me think about the offer. They made a mistake, then they took a gamble and they lost. I have never heard of a programming job where the compensation was ""non-negotiable"" let alone being obligated to accept it verbally without prior knowledge of benefits. 

Two months later I had two competing offers for twice the pay, full health care and considerable paid time off. The place I work at now throws a free beer party every Friday and I couldn't have been happier with my decision to reject that offer. 

So in bullet points here are my tips:

* Know your worth: Read average salaries for your area if you're offered much less there is a reason and it might not be you

* Nail the interview: Interviewing is key to getting offers. If you're coming out of college like me, think of them as final exams for your major and you'll be in the right mindset for preparing for them.

* Beware of Recruiters: They *can* help you find jobs, but its not their job to give you a good one. Most are paid on commission. 

* Practice interviewing : Accept interviews for jobs and places that you may not actually want. Don't interview at your dream job first, you have one chance and you're going to make mistakes your first time through.

Here's my situation, I graduated from college this past May. I already had a job during my senior year and upon graduation, they took me on board for full time. However, they don't pay enough so I can support myself and have had to find an extra job. I get paid one dollar more than the intern and I've been at this job for over a year- i feel like in this economy, I should be happy that I even have a job, but it still rubs me the wrong way. I've made some mistakes, especially when I overloaded myself with schoolwork in my last semester, but things are going much smoother lately.  I understand that I will probably have to work two jobs for a while since I'm just starting out but I've also  figured that since I'm salaried and not hourly, Ill be lucky to get 4-6% of a raise, which amounts to about $2k extra a year. I will be needing to find a way to pay student loans; i can't do so with even two jobs. So I'm putting out feelers on the job market in case another opportunity comes my way. 

My questions are: 

- In general, if you apply to a job, does the potential employer contact your current employer in any way? 

- If I'm asked to interview with a company, what are some general guidelines on how to make time to fit that into a work week?
   
- if I have to step out of the office to interview, would I say something along the lines of, ""I have an appointment at such time.""

- any other tips would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much!

2008 was a blur for me, I think I was struggling with social anxiety issues which inhibited me from finding work, 2009 I got onto Youth Allowance for finding a job which didn't seem to work that well. In 2010 I started a course for Games Design (what I was interested in at the time) which ended in 2011, however I did partake in a 6 month quality assurance internship for an independent game studio (relevant for data entry). Still, it's a very difficult profession to find work for, so in 2012 I spent the first 6 months looking for any job without Centelink's assistance and again I was unsuccessful, couldn't even land an interview.

How to get HR to lay me off?,48,15,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/19ufft/hostile_work_environment_how_to_get_hr_to_lay_me/,"In the last 3 months my newest manager has created a very hostile work environment. Within the first few weeks of being my manager he scheduled a meeting with me during my FMLA to discuss my yearly review. He said I was in the bottom 10% of his employees and that I sucked all around at my job (the gist anyway). The meeting took about 1.5 hours. That was in December. At the time I asked for a road map so I could prove myself to my new manager and he said that I should just work harder and be a self starter. Pretty much he said that it was up to me to improve my performance and that I should need less guidance. 

In the next 2 months he has given me conflicting direction on what I should be focused on with one day telling me to stop working on something then the next day asking why that same thing had not been completed. It got pretty irrational at times. 

Fast forward to last Friday. He tells me that he was going to give me a road map but that I suck so much at my job that he doesn't see the point and that I should take the rest of the day off to contemplate quitting. He wrote his list of grievances down in an email. I sent back a reply with my version of events. At that point I figured I was either getting fired with cause or laid off. 

Monday morning HR calls me. She tells me that she found out about the Friday meeting and understands that it was pretty rough for me. That she is going to require that my boss provide me with a month long road map to get me up to speed. 

The first task on the road map is to create a complex task that he usually gives new hires to improve their skills, do this Friday. I say OK, and my plan was to ask someone in the company how they did it and use that as an example to complete my task. By my own bosses admission the task usually takes new hires 6-8 weeks to complete. So, when I approach my co-worker - I am told that my boss specifically told my peers to not help me or work with me in anyway and to tell him if I ask. I approached HR and my boss about it and he started back tracking. Since then he has enacted other subversive efforts to keep me from completing my road map.

At this point I am ready and willing to leave the company. However, when HR lays people off they provide 6 weeks severance pay. Now I just want my 6 weeks severance pay and go somewhere else. I should be able to pick up another job within a few weeks and have some very good leads worked out because I have seen this coming for a while. 

Also, I am a young white male so I do not fit into any discrimination categories that I can think of.

I put out 40 resumes (since I was in no hurry to leave my current employment) and got 12 phone interviews out of that. From the 12 phone interviews, I got 5 in-person interviews. From those 5 in-person interviews, I was offered 5 positions. I finally accepted 1 of those 5. 

1- Prior to my search, I was on the search committee for a new supervisor. I used that as a case study in good/bad/indifferent interviewing styles. I paid attention to their body language, word choices, and dress. From there, I chose the ones that I felt would best represent me and my beliefs, personality, and ideas to add to my repertoire. 

2- I took one of the most successful candidates from that pool and used their resume as a template for my own. The one I chose had a brief introductory paragraph and 5 bullet points highlighting my relevant skills in place of the second paragraph. The third paragraph discussed my previous work and school experience and why I though my skills fit their position. PROOF READ every letter before you hit send.

3- I prepped for each phone interview by researching their website and choosing questions specific to their department. I also added a few questions that were based on things they mentioned during the interview. This helped to illustrate my listening skills as well as my continued interest in the position.

4-During the phone interview, I repeated key phrases and ideas that they mentioned, including wording they used in their questions. This has repeatedly shown to [build rapport](http://www.thenlpcompany.com/practical-rapport-building-for-interviews/), and confirm comprehension. 

5-At the end of each interview, I expressed my continued interest in the position and asked when I could expect to hear from them again.

6-Preparing for the in-person interview was similar to the phone interview. I did more research on the department and the key people I would be meeting with. I read up on anything they'd published or initiatives they were known for. 

7- I chose a suit that was ""classic"" (just a plain black suit) and a shirt under it that showed some personality. Your color choice should reflect your personality, without making you seem aggressive or boring. Choose classic shoes that are free of scuffs, as well.

8-During the in-person interview, I used the word/phrase repetition again. I chose not to bring pre-prepared questions. Instead, I riffed on ideas that they discussed and asked for more information about that. For example, one director discussed assessment as a key initiative they would be working on, so at the end, I asked a question about what they were currently doing with assessment and how I might be able to assist in moving the department forward.

9- Smile. Be confident.There is nothing sexier than confidence. Often hiring is based on the arbitrary idea of [whether someone wants to be your friend](http://career-advice.monster.ca/job-interview/following-up/real-reasons-you-didnt-get-job/article.aspx?WT.mc_n=Ycanada_YToday), so ask what they like to do. Talk about items on their desk. See where they like to travel. 

10-At the end of your interview, ask this very simple question: ""When do I start?"" It sets the tone for them wanting to please you by giving you the position, and it shows them you are serious and committed to the job. 

11-Thank you notes. I know, I know, there's a lot of good arguments for why you shouldn't send them, but think about it this way: if you send a thank you (at least to the boss and hiring manager or person who scheduled your interview) they are reminded of you as they consider candidates. The more they think of you, the better. 

I hope this is helpful. Please feel free to ask me any questions about my search or experience. And good luck with YOUR search :)",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,t3_v3w9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/v3w9v/how_i_got_a_job/,
1336562730.0,36,self.jobs,tejjq,UPDATE: Redditors I need your help. I'm at risk of losing my dream job.,40,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tejjq/update_redditors_i_need_your_help_im_at_risk_of/,"Original post is [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/sq2ca/redditors_i_need_your_help_im_at_risk_of_losing/). So I went for my (third) interview with three senior managers last Wednesday morning. The interview was tough especially when it became clear that I lacked the career advisor experience they were looking for. I tried to convince them that much of the technical knowledge they were asking (i.e. how they application procedures differ between a multi-national bank and a hedge fund) were things I could learn on the job but to no avail. Needless to say, I wasn’t very surprised when they called a few hours later to say that I was unsuccessful for the role. 

Luckily, however, my passion for higher education, combined with my diverse range of experience in sector, convinced them to hire me for an admin post, with some career advisor elements thrown in. I still had to go for a fourth interview yesterday which was mainly a formality and a chance for them to give me a few admin proficiency tests, which I easily passed.

So after seven months, my job hunt is finally over. It took a lot longer than I thought and was pretty tough handling the excitement of finding a suitable role and then the disappointment of not being selected. Still, everything worked out pretty much as I’d hoped for: I have a job in the field I want, working with a great team, with plenty of opportunities for promotion and a salary dead on my expectations. Here are some of the things I learned along the way…

1)	Keep in regular touch with your recruiters. I had seven of them working to find me a post. Only two of them were really any good but they were very friendly and really worked hard. It also helped that I popped in occasionally to say ‘Hi’ and just remind them of who I was and that I was still searching. I think recruiters are more inclined to work hard for you if they like you (and you have desirable/marketable skills).

2)	Know yourself. This is by far the most important one in my mind. If you have a comprehensive understanding of what you’re good at, what types of tasks you like and what you dislike then you’re much more likely to recognise an opportunity when it presents itself or, alternatively, avoid applying for positions you really aren’t well suited for. The Myers-Briggs Personality Test was really helpful for me in this regards. I learned that I’m an ENFP which really aided me in figuring out what my ideal career might be.

3)	Similar to the above – take advantage of books such as What Color is your Parachute and other job hunting guides. Parachute had a whole bunch of exercises aimed at teaching you about yourself which really helped me figure out what I wanted to do. It’s also a good way working on your job hunt when you tire of sending out applications and filling in forms at the end of a day.

4)	Don’t let a new job opportunity excite you too much. This way, if you’re unsuccessful, the disappointment won’t erode your confidence. This is easier said than done I know but too many times I got really excited about a role, stopped sending out as many applications as I could have because I was sure I’d get an interview/offer, and then was completely crushed when it didn’t happen. 

Thanks to all of you for your support and encouragement. It’s a relief to have the process over and done with. **For those of you still hunting, hang in there and stay positive. You never know when your luck and perseverance will pay off. It did for me.**

**TL;DR - I got a job**

It gets worse. Here's the story.

My third choice employer blatantly asked how much money my first choice is offering, and which job I would prefer (1st is offering more, and would be a better job, but I can't be picky right now). I'm a noob and didn't consider this situation before it happened, so I told 3rd choice that I can't make that decision until I really know the two companies, but that I would likely prefer the my first choice if pay was similar. I also told 3rd choice the salary that I asked from 1st choice. BAD BAD BAD!

They set up an interview anyway, and it was all going smooth until my flight got cancelled. Fuck. Turns out that instead of rescheduling the following Monday, they decide to say ""no thanks, if you get this job, you will likely leave soon because you prefer the other company."" Uh, I haven't been offered either position, so why are you jumping to that conclusion, I said. I ended up practically hanging up on them.

Luckily my first and second choice employers are still in the running.

**TLDR:** Never tell a potential employer any details about other places you are looking at, especially compensation and which job you would prefer.

The lesson I learned? You basically have to lie*. It sucks, I'm trying to be honest, but honest people get fucked.

1332208246.0,35,self.jobs,r4f3e,"6+ months unemployed, 9 failed interviews, but I started my new job today. Here’s what I learned about looking for a job...",36,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/r4f3e/6_months_unemployed_9_failed_interviews_but_i/,"**1. Interviews are mostly useless to companies, so use  them to your advantage.** I assume a lot of HR people are going to disagree with me on this, but I think interviews serve very little purpose. Being good at interviews and being good at your job are (for most people) two very different skill sets. So the person who could do the best job for the company may be rejected because he or she happens to speak too quietly or has a limp handshake. I mean sure, interviewing can weed out terrible candidates, but most people can fake politeness, professionalism, competence, and sanity for an hour or two.

Luckily you can use this to gain an advantage over more qualified candidates. Seriously, if you practice your interview skills, then you can snag that job out from the clutches of the guy who is clearly more qualified than you.

**2. Don’t take rejection personally.** So you’ve been waiting in anticipation for weeks after your interview. You thought it went well, and are really excited about the company. Then you get the dreaded email: a terse, generic message informing you that they’ve gone with another candidate. It’s a pretty big blow to the ego. But please, do yourself a favor and don’t take it personally. More important, don’t let it discourage you.

The truth is that you have absolutely no idea why you were passed over (unless by some miracle they provide you with feedback). Sometimes HR just needs to fill an interview quota. Sometimes a hiring manager had already intended to hire a friend but just conducted some sham interviews in an effort to look unbiased. Sometimes there is not even a position available, but the company just wanted to see what kind of talent was out there. These things probably happen more than you’d expect, so don’t take it so personally - think of it as an opportunity to improve your interview skills. In the end, I think perseverance is what’s needed for a successful job search.

**3. Recruiters/temp agencies are a mixed bag, so have reasonable expectations.** I probably spoke with a dozen recruiting agencies and most of them were a complete waste of time. They just want to get you entered into their database so they can claim to have “over ____ amount of active candidates!” Then you never hear from them again because they don’t actually do much recruiting in your field. On the other hand, some are extremely helpful even if they can’t land you any interviews. One extremely nice recruiter practically re-wrote my resume for me.

So read the advice on r/jobs about recruiters and approach them with some skepticism. But if you find a really nice recruiter then latch on!

**4. Try to learn as much as you can about the company culture before the interview.** This sounds obvious, but it’s definitely a mistake I made. In one interview I was going on and on about how I learned (in my last job) how to deal with unexpected problems. A lot of the time, I explained, upper management was either absent or too busy to deal with problems that arose in my department, so I learned to use my own judgement to squash problems in their tracks. I thought it was a great little speech, but the interview informed me that this is *never* to be done at this company -- any problems not specifically outlined in procedural documents were to be turned over to senior management, no decisions were to be made without them. Oops. I wasn’t offered the job.

Do it at the end of the day or end of the week.  Put as much detail as possible.  It will advance your career.

**Example**: you are a cashier at a local gas station.  write down how many customers you handled (estimate), how much cash you handled, how much inventory you did, etc.  write down anything uneventful.

**Example 2**: you are a sysadmin at a business.  write down the progress of all your projects. keep track of hours you worked or had to be on call.  were there any fires you had to put out?  what did you learn this week?  write it all down.  Try to put things in terms of money generated or saved.

Two reasons why this will advance your career:

1. When it's time for your job review, you will have specific facts to back up claims that you are a good employee deserving of a raise or promotion.  You can say things like ""I generated $1000 in revenue this month."" Or ""I put in 100 extra hours last month to make sure we hit a deadline.""  If you hadn't written it down, you would have forgotten all the details and wouldn't back up your claim that you deserve a raise or promotion.

2. You're resume becomes a breeze to write.  Now you have a lot of examples that demonstrates why you are an excellent employee.

They say they only ship products to customers once they have received payment, but it takes a month before an international money order clears in Russia, and this causes a delay for their customers.

So they are looking for someone who will cash cheques at a local bank. Keep 5%, and send them the rest via an instant payment system like western union or money gram.

I'm a college student, pursuing part-time work to help me pay fees that aren't covered by my financial aid. I only need 15-20 hours a week. The rest is either spent studying or in rehearsal. 

I applied to a Bed, Bath, and Beyond and got an interview. I go through the process, explaining my situation and being completely honest. I tell them I'm in class during the day, so I won't be available. On my job application, I listed that I was available Tuesday through Sunday from 4pm-11pm. I have rehearsals on Monday from 6pm-11pm and Saturday from 2pm-6pm (I'm a theater major). Pick any 15-20 hours from 4pm-11pm. He gladly obliged, said it's admirable to pursue an education. I was hired on the spot, filled out all the paperwork, and told my schedule will be emailed in about 72 hours. Fantastic.

Just got the schedule. Here's what it says.

1. Saturday (July 6th) - 10:30am - 7pm
2. Monday - 8am - 5pm
3. Tuesday - 8am - 5pm
4. Wednesday - 8am-5pm
5. Thursday - 6pm - close
6. Friday - 8am-5pm
7. Saturday - 10:30am - 7pm

Why did this happen? How could they tell me these things about admirable pursuit of an education, then blatantly ignore all of it? The only shift I'd be able to work on that schedule is Thursday, 6pm-close. I'm in class from 8am-4pm, I cannot possibly work this schedule.

What is going on here?

**EDIT** - Hey everyone, thanks for all the replies. I wasn't so much whining and complaining, but more looking for advice. Basically, I was asking if they can do this and just disregard everything? Should I assume I have to look elsewhere since they seem to be unable to compromise and have no problem lying directly to my face like I'm crazy? I should have expanded further before, but there is no training program. I was told that on a Saturday or Sunday, I had to come in and watch a few videos, go through a few computer modules, and the rest of the training is live fire on the floor (I'm a sales rep). It's only disappointing since I've been unemployed since April because the last job kept trying to squeeze in more hours than I could handle in college, so they let me go as well. I made it so clear in the application AND interview.

I called today, they said it could have been an error, so they'll check, make a new schedule, and I could come get a paper copy. I said okay. I go to get a paper copy, here it is: http://i.imgur.com/H0Sl6Ls.jpg

So, I guess I won't be taking the job? They scratched off a Monday, which is great, but nothing else changed, and they even added an 8-5 shift on Saturday. I asked the manager if this was the correct schedule, he looked it over and said ""yes.""

Background: I graduated last year, majored in science, have been working in a lab 10 months. 

1. My boss is emotionally unstable, highly volatile, unprofessional, and immature.

2. My boss was dishonest with me.  My boss led me to believe, by having me draft my own job description, that I would be a research tech in a permanent, benefited position. My position evolved into that of an administrative/personal assistant on an indefinitely temporary line (I was never offered a written contract). 

3. When I expressed concern about the change in my position, and the fact that I was never consulted or informed until after the fact, my boss told me this was the only job for me and that if I wasn't satisfied I should apply to other jobs.

4. I applied to other jobs, heard back from one, got through 3 interviews, and was unofficially offered the position. While I provided other references, my potential employer insisted upon speaking with my boss. My boss flat-out told me that she wouldn't support me or give me a good reference. My boss said: ""you told me you would leave when you applied to graduate school, and this isn't graduate school."" I urged my potential employer to speak with my other references. SIDE NOTE: Yes, I did inform my potential employer about my current situation with my boss, citing ""personal and professional differences"" and ""a realization that my current job does not align with my career goals."" 

5. I found out today that I didn't get the job. Potential employer apologized for putting my current job in jeopardy and said ""confidentially, I think you deserve a more supportive mentor."" 

This is my first job out of college- while some other co-workers might be willing to give me references, I know my boss never will. I also forgot to mention that I moved across the country to help my boss relocate her lab. I have been a good employee, an integral part of her team, and she doesn't want me to leave.

Last September I interviewed for a position at my dream company. They had a hiring freeze at the company two days after I interviewed (my luck!!). During that time at my current company, I completed a really big project and ended up getting a ridiculous 20% raise to about 74k two weeks ago.

The company that interviewed me back in September called me up telling me that they are considering me for the same position again as the freeze is over.

What exactly should I do? I talked it over with my wife, and she said that it'd be a terribly rude thing to quit my current company after giving me such a large raise. However, this other company is larger, giving me more opportunities to grow, as well as offering to pay for my graduate studies.

Background Information-

I am a civil/environmental engineer graduating this May. I was lucky enough to figure out precisely what I want to do during my 4 years, but have found that this limits my options quite a bit. (I want to consult/design wastewater or potable water treatment systems) As a result, I've been looking into working in countries aside from the US. Options include English speaking countries (I would assume UK US and Australia are my main options here) and Chinese speaking countries (China, Taiwan, HK, etc.)

I applied for a position in the marketing department of a large-ish company around Thanksgiving. The husband of an acquaintance of my mom's is high up in the company, so I contacted him after applying and he told me he'd make sure my resume got seen.

Not long after (early December) I got an email from a woman with the title ""Recruitment Specialist"" saying my high-up contact had forwarded her my resume and she'd like to have a phone interview. The interview went ok but not great in my opinion, but she ended it saying ""I will pass on your resume to the marketing department by the end of the week."" I wrote her a thank you email a day or two later, and about two weeks later a follow up email asking if she'd had a chance to pass my application to the marketing dept. No answer. I assumed I hadn't gotten it and moved on.

In March I got an email from a different person with the title ""Corporate Recruiting Manager"" saying she'd recently gotten my resume from the high-up contact and wanted a phone interview. It seemed a little weird to have a second HR/recruiting interview, but it's a big company, it'd been a few months, maybe they hired someone who didn't work out and they went back to old applications, whatever. She asked very similar questions to the first interview and overall it went very well in my opinion, but she didn't say anything indicating that she knew I'd been interviewed before. She said I'd hear back in about two weeks. I never heard anything.

Now I have a third email requesting a phone interview with a different person. Her title is ""Recruitment Associate"". This email also mentions that she was recently forwarded my resume by the high-up guy, and doesn't mention anything about the fact that this isn't my first interview.

In theory I really want this job, but does this indicate that the company is a mess to work at? Should I say anything about being interviewed already or just go with it and have my third first-round interview?

**TL;DR I applied for a job 6 months ago and interviewed but didn't hear back. I interviewed again a few months later with someone who didn't seem to know I'd interviewed already, and didn't hear back again. Now I'm being asked to interview again with another person who doesn't seem to know that I've interviewed not once, but twice already. I'm confused.**

1357668465.0,33,self.jobs,1670l0,My girlfriend is coming home crying from stress at work and I don't know what other advice to give her. Can anyone help?,36,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1670l0/my_girlfriend_is_coming_home_crying_from_stress/,"She's been under a lot of stress lately, coming home crying and venting her frustrations often. I've tried to console her but I can't do anything about it, other than to give advice on how to deal with it. The problem is that I've never dealt with what she's going through, so I don't know how to actually help her. Here's the situation:

My girlfriend (lets call her Sarah) is very complaisant and accommodating, which allows some people who are very rude and argumentative to walk all over her without regretting much of anything. She works at a major studio company for a small department that's very secluded by outside interference. She has worked there for almost 3 years, along with her three friends (who she's known since they were kids and helped get them hired to work almost literally beside her). Recently, in the past year, almost everyone in her department has antagonized her because she doesn't join in on the self perpetuating drama they create and maintain in the office.

Her manager is a 40+ year old woman who loves drama and uses her corporate hierarchy status against anyone who she would deem useless to her. Then there's the former friends who have used their old relationship with Sarah against her, making her look bad by spreading rumors and forming a group against her at work. It all sounds like some immature high school crap, involving social politics and such. But the manager and her lemmings have already pressured two good and honest workers to quit through fear of having their careers ruined. And Sarah is beginning to worry that she's next.
Things from spreading rumors, to brown nosing the manager and gaining favor whilst blaming department mistakes on Sarah, to forcing her to be part of their daily ritual of drama stories about other people in the company. It seems like they're using whatever resources they can to driving her insane and keeping her on a leash at the same time. It's even worse because she's known her coworkers for over a decade, and has kept in touch with them as close friends for years. And now they've all abandoned her. I mean these people are so vengeful that they bring their personal feelings and grudges to work, even when Sarah has disconnected from them in her life. She can't even go to HR to complain about it because she'll be blacklisted by her manager.

Now my girlfriend is doing what she's been doing for the past year, which is putting on a fake smile and nodding to anything anyone says, just to stay out of trouble. But it's beginning to get to her. I've told her to find another job, which shouldn't be so difficult for her since she has the credentials and experience, along with many great references to back her up. But the issue is still with her manager. This woman is very dedicated to shaming anyone who leaves her department in bad taste. And she can smell the scent of fear.

I've already told her to build up a tougher shell against this type of stuff, and loads of other cliche advice about having to deal with this everywhere in life. When she comes home, I try my best to relax her and make her laugh, but I can tell that she's having bits and pieces of her soul sucked out every time she goes to work. Her friends and family tell her to suck it up but I think her finding another job would be better. The only things that stop her from quitting is that 1) She absolutely loves what she does and the company she works for and 2) Her evil bitch of a manager would probably take it as an offense and plan to shame her to any company that she might want to move to (she has a lot of connections).

What can she do? Or what should she do?

**TL;DR Girlfriend is being driven insane by her managers and coworkers (friends she helped get hired) and now they're almost ganging up on her and trying to get her fired.**

1340814946.0,31,self.jobs,vowqm,I'll donate a percentage of my salary to charity if you help me find a job in LA (x-post),49,18,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vowqm/ill_donate_a_percentage_of_my_salary_to_charity/,"Reddit, I need a job.  In Los Angeles.  Tons of people need jobs, and I'm not necessarily any more worthy or qualified than the next person, but I am desperate.

So, in exchange for your help finding me a job, I will offer something in return:  **I'll donate a percentage of my salary to the charity of your choice*.  For at least a year.**

I'm not even that picky.  My criteria are simply that it be at least a step above retail (I'm fine with office work or customer service), and that after all the money is given to charity, my take home is at least $15,000 (which is actually a little more than I'm living on now).

**Now for the important stuff: The percentage given to charity:**

* 5% Just for getting me a job
* 5% If it's in the film industry
* 5% If it's within 3 miles of me, 4% for 4 miles, 3% for 5 miles, etc. (La Cienega &amp; the 10)

This can easily turn into a couple grand going to charity.

**About me:** I'm a smart, hard-working 28-year-old who's never been fired from a job.  I don't do drugs, if that matters to you.  The reason (I believe) that I'm having trouble finding a job is that I've been working freelance for 4 years and almost all of my references have expired.

Right now I make money as a freelance script reader/editor.  I love this, am very confident in my skills and would love to continue in this industry.  I've worked on film sets, helped out at production companies and done just about everything to scripts that you can.  However, I didn't go to school for it, so it's hard to get my foot in the door.

I also have a history in over-the-phone customer service and office work.  While I'm most passionate about film, I've done well working jobs like these.  As much as I love my freelance business, the fluctuations and dry spells are wearing thin, so a straightforward steady employment sounds really welcome right now.  I'm a quick learner and can adapt to about any job you guys can find for me.

I don't think Reddit is my personal army, or that this is the best way to get a job.  As I mentioned before, I'm desperate.  I've been applying for jobs daily for months now.  I've thrown myself out there in every way I can think of.  I'd have been schmoozing at GRMuD if I hadn't found work on Craigslist cleaning out some very creepy guy's garage for $50.  I make enough money to pay rent and eat, but I'm getting close to the breaking point.  I've got a bank account with less than $10, and due to some medical issues, my parents aren't a safety net.  I don't want to give up and leave this city, or the people that I love who live here.  Since I had this idea, I've held off on asking for your help for months, until it's finally hit the point that my ""worry"" side of the scale outweighs the ""look like an entitled ass"" side.

Writing samples for my script coverage, resumes, references, etc. are available on request.  Please ask me if you have any questions.  And since Los Angeles is all about headshots, [here I am] (http://i.imgur.com/mdtxJ.jpg), so you know you won't be hiring a terrifying internet stranger.  Beard is optional.
