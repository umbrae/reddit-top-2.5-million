I've graduated, but back when I was at school I was a captain who saw a gay teammate really struggle with whether to tell us of his sexuality, and it made me regret that I hadn't taken more preemptive steps at the start of the season. You know how when you played freeze-tag as a kid there was always a safe zone, someplace you could catch your breath before heading back out into the game? The frisbee field has a chance to be that safe zone. On the other side of the world, Ultimate Peace is trying to make friz a safe zone for Palestinians and Israelis. For me, ultimate was a safe place to be ridiculously nerdy but still participate in athletics. I know to a lot of us it almost goes without saying that you don't need to worry about homophobes or misogynists or racists or whatever when on the frisbee field, but it's not always clear to newbies. So maybe at one of your first practices of the year in the circle beforehand when you're making announcements, casually mention that on your team it doesn't matter whether you're gay, straight, polkadotted, whatever. Say it explicitly, proudly. Let it be known that your team is a safe zone. As a white heterosexual guy, lord knows I don't have much to stress about, so the least I can do is give my friends who need it someplace they know they can relax and be themselves without fear. It all probably sounds silly, but I really wish I had done this back in the day.",,False,,t5_2qnym,False,,,True,t3_yrw8y,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/yrw8y/to_all_college_players/,

A big thanks to the ultimate community over the last few years for supporting the development of all things NexGen. It’s been a blast working for you! NexGen turns three sometime this year and as we face a rapidly changing media landscape in our sport I’d like to take a moment to answer any questions you have about NexGen, NGN, the Tour, anything, etc. and solicit your feedback for what you’d like to see in the future.

I’m also raising awareness for our in-house event the West Coast Cup, which is a potential direction for NexGen in the years to come. Learn more at http://westcoastcup.ngnultimate.com or see the [article](http://skydmagazine.com/2013/08/west-coast-cup-experiment/) in Skyd Magazine.

Feel free to start posting questions now or if you’re a procrastinator wait until noon Pacific Time on Tuesday, August 13 and I’ll answer them then.

Upvote this text post for visibility, and post in the comments about tryout dates I have missed or details people may want/need to know about teams.

I have compiled this list from reddit posts, RSD posts, and various other internet spots. It is hardly a complete list, but let's make it better for everyone's sake. These are sorted in no particular order.

I have also started adding in disc associations where you can possibly find other teams that have no tryouts or to find summer leagues to play in in addition to a club team. If you know of any others, please let me know.

Currently **98** teams listed.

1315486393.0,86,self.ultimate,k8rj6,You don't need to get any glory to be the most important player on the field.,93,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/k8rj6/you_dont_need_to_get_any_glory_to_be_the_most/,"In light of a few of the posts I've been reading recently, I felt the need to point something out that may not be apparent to many players:

You don't have to be ""That Guy"" to be a great ultimate player.

What I mean by this is that there are many players on a team who are the heart and soul of their team, without always showing it off.  As a coach, I get asked many times how players can improve their game because certain players often feel that they aren't contributing since they aren't the ones involved in the glorious, big plays and I then remind them, as I am reminding you, an NFL QB without a good supporting cast, still sucks.  Here are some examples of the types of players I mean (chances are good that, if you are a good player who thinks they need to get better at something, you are one of these types, who I would put on my team anytime):

""Possession Handlers"" - you guys are the bread and butter of a team.  Often found in an ""Apex"", ""Reset"" or ""God"" type position, these are the people that you rely on 100% of the time.  They always make good decisions, are not selfish, do not look for glory, and rarely do anything risky.  The catch and throw the swings, make easy upfield passes, are always there for the dump, directing traffic.  These players are always playing within their game, and although they may seem conservative, their team will rely on them to do what's best for the team.  These are the type of people who need to be involved in politics, doing what's best for the team, and not what will make them look good.  These people throw 95% less turnovers than the ""Stud"" handlers.

""Shut down defenders"" - These are players who are seemingly forgotten, especially be people watching the game.  Did you see them lay-out for a D?  No...they didn't have to...nobody ever threw it to the person they were defending.  They don't need to sky the offense because the disk is never thrown near them, as they are occupying all the useful space.  Rarely getting point blocks, but never getting broken, these defenders make championship caliber teams.  

""First cutters"" - In many offenses, especially in zone, flat (""ho"") or split type offenses, players must work in pairs (or, surprise, as a team) to create holes and make open spaces happen.  The ""First Cutter"" is the type of player who make sure they move the defenders out of the way, creating lanes for the other cutters on the team.  The most frustrated player on the field, the First Cutter never sees their handy-work pay off, as they are never thrown the disc, but the reason they never get the disc is due to the fact that they draw double or triple teams.  With perfect situational awareness, Lana (a skill that cannot be taught, by the way), these players see the field how it needs to be, and they make the magic happen, these players are the motor of the offense, making sure the handlers have an available receiver at all times, sacrificing their own glory to allow the flow to continue.

TL;DR - Have confidence in your own game, know your role on the field and dominate it like it is nobody's business - your team may not thank you, but they should, and everybody knows it but you (until now)",,False,,t5_2qnym,False,,,True,t3_k8rj6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/k8rj6/you_dont_need_to_get_any_glory_to_be_the_most/,

For the past 5 years I have worked full time as a strength and conditioning coach. I have worked in private facilities, at D 1 and D 3 varsity facilities as well as at the National Strength and Conditioning Association in COS. Currently I train out of Mike Boyle Strength and Conditioning in Boston.  MBSC is an amazing gym with the best coaches in the world. We were rated the Mens Health #1 Gym in America in 2010.

I am the strength coach for the Boston Ironside Ultimate frisbee team and owner of Explosive Ultimate and Morrill Performance.  

Aside from business and coaching I am devoted to a life of consistent improvement and building towards reaching the human potential.  I live and breathe movement, learning and having fun in the process.  I like to teach what I learn and have made a habit of doing so.  My love for curriculum development began by teaching 4 classes while working at the University of Northern Iowa. Body Building, Heavy Resistance Training, Total Body Conditioning and Ultimate Frisbee! I have leveraged these curriculum development and teaching skills 
to build my Explosive Ultimate curriculum and teach lessons to my athletes and my YouTube and newsletter subscribers.

While coaching full time I have accumulated a massive collection of strength and conditioning text books and research articles.  I have condensed 68 of these references into the categories Strength, Power, Speed &amp; Agility and added 160 videos and over 100 photos to create my first book [The Foundation](http://strengthandconditioningfitness.com/shop/the-foundation/
). We are officially releasing it today 5-14-13 and I couldn't be more excited!

Anyone who knows me knows that I thrive on positive relationships and seeing people grow and reach their goals.  It is my hope that my friends and members of our growing community will take time
to learn the EU curriculum and read the Foundation. This will allow us all to grow together as a community, speak a common language and edge closer towards reaching our potential as athletes.  In addition the supporters of the book and EU will have a major upper hand in understanding the future content and products I will create. #KeepUp! 

I am thankful for this opportunity and looking forward sharing any insights I can!  

OH! and you can call me Timbo! :)

**THIS IS NOT AN ORDER THREAD**. 

Currently, this is a grassroots effort to get **sublimated jerseys**. We have:

a designer, [fx101](http://www.reddit.com/user/fx101),

a [FIVE Ultimate Rep](http://www.reddit.com/user/theFIVErs),

a bunch of interested redditors (who have commented below),

me (just some guy), and

[this badass jersey](http://i.imgur.com/4Mh6q.jpg) that fx101 created to use as a template.

The process will take some time. Please **make design suggestions** here.

For those interested in the cheaper, easier, and quicker option, we will be starting a **(re)order thread** for the [previous design](http://imgur.com/f9Szs). Five still has the designs, and only needs 10 people to do an order. 

So for now, please hang tight. We will be in touch with those that have shown interest. There will be an order thread for the old Narwalh (sp?) design. There will be a separate thread for the full sublimation jerseys as well, once we get licensing approval.

If you're an artist/designer or know someone who is, now is the time to come up with a design!


*Suggestions / Guidelines:*

* Snoo, the reddit alien is a good starting point (though not required by any means)
* *some illustrated Snoo examples:* [1](http://i.imgur.com/gBtSXQw.jpg) [2](http://i.imgur.com/N4NWaoY.jpg) [3](http://i.imgur.com/QYRtE.jpg)
* the [reddit logo](http://www.reddit.com/about/alien/) should appear somewhere, or there should be space to add it
* submissions can be digitally created or hand drawn/painted (I'll work with you to digitize the design in the case of the latter)

Submit designs to josh@reddit.com (and post them to this thread if you want community feedback).

Any questions, post in this thread.",,False,,t5_2qnym,1367281028.0,,,True,t3_1ddc5k,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/1ddc5k/design_the_official_reddit_disc/,admin

I met a guy this weekend who is biking across Canada playing ultimate. I biked the first 25 km with him. He asked me to write a guest-post on his blog about the ultimate scene in Halifax (where I live and his trip began). I linked to my post specifically, but check out his whole page. I'm just trying to help spread the word.

I have a feeling the numbers will not be possible, but hold your breath. I'll try to answer any questions you have about these shorts, just PM me, that will be faster and easier. I'm going to do a little research into screening and some copyright stuff surrounding the reddit logo and other symbols. 

I'm going to try and answer each of the questions asked individually, but if I don't get to you, PM me. 

If and when Five gets on board, we'll have a design contest, with votes and the like. I'll have my original two designs as well as any others that are submitted. Watch this space for updates. 

Thanks for being awesome guys!

Here's the design again: http://i.imgur.com/BwbW1.png

EDIT (again): Here's an email I got from Five.

&gt;We would love to do an order for Reddit as long as you guys order above our minimum of 15! It would be processed as if you were a team: you'd fill out an order form where you could specify size and we'd send you a quote and mock-ups to approve. Similarly, we would hold you responsible for collecting payments and making sure the balance was settled before we shipped. The only complication over a normal team order, which ships to one address, would be adding a shipping charge for each address you wanted to ship to. If all the all the shipping addresses are domestic we could likely charge a flat rate for all shipments. However, international orders cost a lot more to ship and would complicate things a bit.The shorts as they stand now would require about 6 screens, making them about 34$ + $4 for shipping. We could try to get the crest down to 2 or three colors and that would save a bit of money. Do you happen to have a vector file of the Reddit crest?

cheers,
Kip and the Five Crew

So there it is. From what I read, the screening is going to add some surcharges. I will send another email asking about numbers...in the meantime, I'll make a post with the design thread, watch the ""New"" tab and post your design. The full rules will be listed in the text of that post. 

Also, does anyone have any experience dealing with trademarks and emblems, and if so, could they help me move that particular aspect along?

1366851742.0,61,self.ultimate,1d1u8i,USA Ultimate limits new players: a high school player's point of view,72,11,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/1d1u8i/usa_ultimate_limits_new_players_a_high_school/,"As college ultimate glows temptingly in the future, we're struggling to keep our high school team alive. We're a top 3 team in one of the more competitive states, but we depend on getting random seniors to play each spring to get that far in States. However, USA Ultimate, or at least our local tournament director, is getting stricter and stricter about memberships and having rosters for USA Ultimate sanctioned tournaments.     

I'm a firm believer that it's hard to understand ultimate at a competitive level until one experiences real tournament play, and this weekend, we have State Qualifiers, which is a great opportunity to get new players involved since it is an easy tournament for us. We want to build a better future but the team, but we also always have a lot of new seniors who quit lacrosse or soccer to play ultimate.    

We play only two USA Ultimate-sanctioned events in the spring, so these new players have to play $30 for two tournaments, for which they also need to pay $15-20 each in tournament fees (we receive no school funding). This adds up to $50-70 for one season of play, which is fairly steep for anyone trying to figure out if they want to play seriously.   
I think that the cost of youth memberships greatly limits interest in the sport. I miss the UPA days when memberships were much, much cheaper ($11 intro rate, anyone?) and you could also pay $5 per sanctioned tournament if you didn't want to get a membership.    

High school is a great place to start playing, but I think USA Ultimate is looking for their funding in the wrong place. Most players begin playing ultimate casually, and in college, there are many ways to do this—intramurals, clubs, etc.—but in high school, schools are lucky to even have any team at all. The team is the ""casual"" level of play in high school, and asking high schoolers to fork out $30 for something they view as a new hobby just to compete is turning people away from the sport.     

Possible solutions, or alleviations of the problem:  
-Bring back the pay-per-tournament option  
-Have memberships run from Aug 1 to July 31—this way, a player entering the game in their senior year pays only once for membership, not twice. This also applies for college-level memberships.    
-Stop fucking charging us so much.  

Basically, this has been an irritated rant. I might just be being a little bitch about supporting our sport, but I honestly think this is preventing people from playing. I've paid my membership for four years straight and seen the price rise every year, but that I feel as if the team has a bleak future because we can't get new players interested.

1339168053.0,59,self.ultimate,urngx,A note on highlight reels,71,12,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/urngx/a_note_on_highlight_reels/,"Hi r/ultimate,


Lately, I've noticed a lot of posts of highlight reels from high school and college level frisbee.  It's great to see the game expanding at these levels, but to call the videos ""highlight reels"" is a misnomer.


A true sports highlight has a lot of action or has a great play.  For example, Beau's skying of catch of three guys at the 2009 USAU Club Championships had a lot of action and Andrew Fleming's lay out catch at 2010 World Clubs was a great play.


In my opinion, good highlights include (but are not limited to):

- A huge sky on O or on D

- A great lay out on O or on D

- A great mark

- Breaking the mark effortlessly

Bad highlights include (but are not limited to):

- A catch in the end zone by a player who is uncovered

- A misthrown pass that is D'ed

- A predictable huck

- Any player catching a routine pass  


A good highlight can also be ruined by poor camera work.  Any highlight worth including in your reel should be unobstructed and fully in frame.  A great layout D that is unclear because your grandpa forgot he was holding a camera makes for a bad highlight.  Make sure we know what's going on and we can get a feel for the play.

Here are some examples of good highlight reels (by no means is this list exhaustive):

[Nick Lance Callahan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7tkegQmLII)

[Best of women's ultimate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fguRqolq9-I)

[Greatest highlight reel ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq3pg0JcJSI)

[2007 UPA highlights Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wDvuBTj8Vk)

These highlight reels are all 3 - 5 minutes in length.  It is tempting to include all of your teammates in your team's highlight reel, however, the videos become long and tedious to watch.  A good rule of thumb is that your video should be one song's length long. 

With these tips in mind, you can create a better highlight video; one that shows how great your team is and one that's more exciting to watch.

Thanks

Hopefully this will decrease the financial risk of running a tournament and will give players an opportunity to purchase gear they otherwise wouldn't have access to.

I'm planning on launching the site in January, and right now I am simply looking for two things. 

1) If you have surplus tournament merchandise you want to get out of storage and sell, I would love to hear from you. You can contact me by email at AlexWelcing@rediscable.com

2) If you have suggestions or requests for features you would like included on a site designed for selling ultimate gear, I'd like to hear it. Feel free just to comment with your suggestions so we can crowd source some ideas here.

Does this sound like something you would be interested in? I'd love the feedback.

Thanks,

* There will be fireworks coinciding with the open ceremonies; they will take place alongside [a pretty cool festival.](http://www.raleighconvention.com/works/)
* Pro-tip: ~~Bring an umbrella and rain jacket. Based on the 7-day forecast and the way NC has been getting hit for the past several days, rain would not surprise me.~~ Looks like the week of thunderstorms has passed. Might want to still bring that umbrella, though - it is very hot and sunny, and shade via trees is sporadic.
* Pro-tip: Bring a disc and some sharpies for autographs. There will be players from around the world, and an internationally-signed disc would make any collection look ridiculously cool. I personally will be trying to get at least one signature from every country.
* edit: **BRING WATER.** If there was one thing USAU did wrong, it was the water service for guests. While each field seemed to be stocked with plenty of water, the coolers were set up in a way that catered to players but not fans. Additionally, tournament HQ and the vendor area had zero water coolers, and volunteers (who were driving around golf carts filled with the coolers) seemed to be rather unsure of if it was okay to distribute water to guests.

**Vendors:**

* Merchandise: ~~Does anyone know if Five, VC, Spin etc will be attending to sell schwag? edit: Spin and AB Pro are sponsors, so they will~~ edit: Vendors I saw: TFDA, AB Pro, Spin, VC, Five, USA Utimate. Freebies were decals, keychains, Five had wristbands. Spin had the largest selection of jerseys, USAU had the largest selection of discs. USAU also carried some DVDs of older footage, pretty cool. In addition to the vendors there is a ""speed disc"" throwing station - similar to that of baseball games - which seemed to attract a lot of social attention.
* Food: See page 10 of the [event guide.](http://www.usaultimate.org/assets/1/Page/2013%20USOpen_EventGuide_web.pdf)

&gt;Dear Connecticut Constitution family,

&gt;It is with great sadness that we are forced to announce the indefinite suspension of all team operations as of 2:00pm EST this afternoon. This decision comes at an inopportune time as we journey through the inaugural season. This has been a journey dotted with success after success for our team and our franchise. The Connecticut team is one of the premiere franchises in the league both in victories and in fan attendance. The AUDL has sued the Constitution and the Rhode island Rampage and that suit has caused us to spend an enormous amount of money protecting our rights, instead of allowing us to use those funds for our operations.

&gt;During May 2012, we became aware of the sale of both the New York City and Boston territories, and together with the Rhode Island owner, we challenged the League to answer why we were not approached about these sales prior to the League selling these territories inasmuch as both of these new teams existed within our owned territories. The territory ownership area is governed by a Territory License Agreement (TLA) that was created, signed and approved by the League. This territory agreement allows us to own an area that includes a 100 mile radius. New York City and Boston are within our territories.

&gt;We sought answers to our concerns numerous times and felt that the TLA was clear and that no other team could exist in our area. After numerous attempts to get clarification from the League, we suggested that this might need to be addressed by attorneys. Unfortunately, the League decided that instead of taking this to a discussion, they elected to file a suit against us. This lawsuit was filed from Michigan, and includes a number of allegations within their suit. They allege that the contract they wrote doesn’t mean what it says, among other items.

&gt;We have been forced to retain attorneys in both Connecticut and Michigan to answer their allegations, protect our territory and to seek additional clarification over these claims. The costs to defend this lawsuit have robbed us of necessary operating funds needed to complete our season and caused us to rethink the value of the partnership we sought to create with this League.

&gt;The League, almost as quickly as it filed the suit, has stated that it will consider withdrawing the suit and rescind the New York City territory although in almost the same breath the League has offered to withdraw the suit and keep the territory and offer us no compensation for the taking of our territory, a territory that we have cultivated all season. The League continues to be silent about the Boston territory.

&gt;Our organization cannot absorb the cost of these attorney fees and continue operational costs. In addition, we have requested that the League reimburse us for the attorney fees and the League has stated that they are not willing to do that. The League has decided to suspend discussions with us and simply report that we ‘are unable to finish the season’. We adamantly deny this callous statement.

&gt;Therefore, we are forced to indefinitely suspend our operations until the League withdraws the suit, rescinds the territories and makes us whole for these attorney fees. Our team will continue to operate as a unit during this suspension and we are ready to play on and we will continue our season as soon as we can get this issue resolved.

&gt;Regrettably,

&gt;Bryan Ricci CEO

Lyle not only allowed people to camp on his property, but would host the huge party, grill food for everyone, and keep people safe.  Lyle is a Grinnell College icon, not just for the ultimate team but for everyone at the campus from his work in the dining hall.  

For anyone who ever attended Elephantitus, Lyle was one very big reason that the tournament could happen.  

Recently it was announced that Lyle has cancer.  His disability payments are running out, and he cannot return to work. Everyone at the college is saddened, both alums and current students.  We are all doing what we can to help Lyle and his family through this time.

If you ever went to Elephantitus, and especially the party, you'll know Lyle is the man.  If you are feeling generous and would like to help, here is a link to a donation page for his family:  [Help Lyle](http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/lyle-needs-our-help/69527?fb_action_ids=619125964666&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map=%7B%22619125964666%22%3A288701064609734%7D&amp;action_type_map=%7B%22619125964666%22%3A%22og.likes%22%7D&amp;action_ref_map=%5B%5D)

I found a brief paper from 2006 that was wasn't very detailed. It listed muscle strains/pulls, ankle injuries, knee injuries, and shoulder injuries as the four most common. The study only polled 135 people and didn't gather detailed data about specificity of the injuries. For example, ""knee injuries"" are all lumped together without specifying whether it was a mild LCL sprain or a full ACL tear. 


So, because I apparently have too much time on my hands (or, more likely, because I'm bad at time management), I threw together my own survey. If you've got 5-10 minutes, fill it out. I've got it set up so that after you complete it you can see the results.


No personal information (beyond age and sex) will be recorded. I'll post the full results when I close the survey.


**Survey link**: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kqFsO939SE3CDMaZ3OkhpxKIiGR5WAKnyXVewUzP33Y/viewform


**EDIT 1**: For those of you who haven't yet taken it:

1. I forgot about hip injuries. Please list those in the last text box.

2. Please only include injuries directly related to Ultimate. This does *not* include injuries due to lifting, track workouts, or whatever else you do to train for ultimate that isn't part of a practice, game, or tournament. 

**EDIT 2**: Preliminary results. Top four injuries as results come in.

20 respondents: muscle strain/pull 70%, knee 55%, ankle 55%, arm/hand 35%

40 respondents: muscle strain/pull 68%, ankle 65%, knee 60%, arm/hand 40%

260 respondents: muscle strain/pull 65%, ankle 61%, knee 43%, shoulder 30%

321 respondents: muscle strain/pull 66%, ankle 62%, knee 45%, arm/hand &amp; leg/feet tied at 37%

360 respondents: muscle strain/pull 67%, ankle 61%, knee 46%, leg/feet 38%

375 respondents: muscle strain/pull 67%, ankle 61%, knee 45%, arm/hand &amp; leg/feet tied at 38%

511 respondents: muscle strain/pull 66%, ankle 61%, knee 45%, leg/feet 38%

525 respondents: muscle strain/pull 66%, ankle 61%, knee 46%, leg/feet 39%

540 respondents (4x original study!): muscle strain/pull 67%, ankle 61%, knee 45%, leg/feet 39%

575 respondents: muscle strain/pull 67%, ankle 61%, knee 46%, leg/feet 39%

**Edit 3**: For those of you listing your injuries in this thread: Your answers will not count towards the final numbers unless you also take the survey.

There are exchanges to fill every niche -- recent exchanges included Star Wars, Adventure Time, and yarn and socks for example.

On their [blog](http://redditgifts.com/blog/view/simple-pleasures-condiments-star-wars/), they have encouraged Redditors to suggest new exchanges on the [RedditGifts facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/redditgifts) You can see plenty of existing suggestions already on the page.

I think it would be sweet if RedditGifts facilitated an Ultimate-related exchange. Posts about trading Ultimate items crop up in this subreddit all the time. Some ideas: discs/frisbees, jerseys, shorts, hats, posters, DVDs, Ulticards, spikeball nets, etc. And the Ultimate community is large enough that an exchange would hopefully yield a lot of participants. (Maybe we could also expand the exchange to ""everything disc"" so disc golf players and frisbee enthusiasts could participate too?)

If you're interested, [post on the RedditGifts Facebook page and let them know!](https://www.facebook.com/redditgifts) Given that there are a lot of messages for other niches, we'll need to have a lot of users posting to stand out.

I've been the resident rules lawyer on all my teams for quite some time, and I thought it was time to clarify a few points for everyone.  Here's how this is going to work:

I've compiled a few points from the 11th edition USAU rules that I've seen players screw up.  I'll provide my interpretation of the rules, followed by relevant citations.  Discussion/questions are welcome.  Please understand that I'm only referring to USAU rules here.  If you want to compare/contrast with WFDF, feel free but please clearly note that you are so doing.  If there is no annotation, we will assume USAU.

How did I choose these points?  They're mostly stuff I have seen players screw up.  A few of them are points from the rules that I thought were abstruse or not well known.  One or two are things *I* didn't know before I went carefully through the rules.

I'll post the first one today, and two more each weekday until I run out.  This will last over a week, unless people get sick of it/don't care.  Any suggestions on how to make my posts better will be welcome, as well.

1367874163.0,43,self.ultimate,1dtely,Let's talk about the MLU spectator experience,51,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/1dtely/lets_talk_about_the_mlu_spectator_experience/,"Honestly, I've been pleasantly surprised with how watchable MLU games have been.  I'd been predicting that players would stop playing Frisbee and start playing Referee, like they do in soccer, but that hasn't happened so far.

But I've got to say:  the MLU need more camera angles, better camera operators, and better commentators.

As far as the operators go:  Watch the Week 3 Portland-Vancouver game.  The camera work is brutal, and the lone camera fails to capture a number of important moments because the guy is asleep at the switch or something.

On that topic, more than one angle is crucial and would help make the game more accessible to non-frisbee-players.  Don't just blindly follow the disc around.  Zoom out at show us the stack, because that's where plays develop.  60 minutes of footage just framing three handlers doing endless dump swings isn't a great spectator experience.

Commentators that aren't abysmal will help in this regard, too.  First and foremost, the commentator's job is to elucidate on-field events for the audience.  That's not happening at the moment, and the experience of watching the game with commentary vs. without commentary is largely the same, especially if you understand the ref's hand signals.

For the videos that go up on YT, go back to the instant replay every now and then and show us the deep cut that set up that goal.  Show us why ABC was able to make that great offensive play because his defender was out of position.  Show us where his defender should have been to stop that play.

Simply shouting out the names of the players who have the disc is lazy commentating, and doesn't help deepen the audience's understanding of the game, and therefore does not make ultimate more accessible to the general public.",,False,,t5_2qnym,False,,,True,t3_1dtely,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/1dtely/lets_talk_about_the_mlu_spectator_experience/,

Celeste lost both of her legs while Sydney is in critical injury. You can read about the family here: http://www.lowellsun.com/todaysheadlines/ci_23036408/lowell-mom-daughter-seriously-injured-boston-blast

Registration is tentatively scheduled to open Wednesday, April 24th. Cost is $26 per person, paypal only. We will take the first 100 players. If space is still available the day of the tournament, players may come first come first serve at $30, cash only. All of the money will go to the family minus any out of pocket expenses which we expect to be minimal (eg., jerseys). More information can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/events/340918649363311/

If you cannot attend and still wish to donate, you can! http://www.gofundme.com/7OTGL We are in the process of establishing rewards for people. Tentatively, these include a special green jersey and NexGen ""George Stubbs"" autographed posters from the 2012 tour. 

As an additional bonus, if we reach our grand goal of $10,000, the UMass Lowell ultimate team will shave my beard (which has been growing without a single trim for 9 months) an added incentive.

Five's screen printing (sublimation is not yet done on shorts :[) website is linked [here](http://fiveultimate.com/team/customization/). This will allow you to get an estimate on cost and any design restrictions. 

RULES:
Designs must be posted here, in comments. In the comment, please include a link to the design (pref. in .png format), the estimated cost, and if you play for a team, list that for us!

The design with the most upvotes will win. If the design needs to be altered (copyright issues, printing issues, etc.), that will be done with the artist of the winning design. 

Designs must include at least one of the following: Reddit crest, the tetx ""reddit.com,"" the text ""r/ultimate,"" the laying out alien, or upvote/downvote arrows. AT LEAST ONE MUST BE INCLUDED.

Designs must include a spot for custom numbers. While this may or may not be possible, a spot should be in place. 

**THIS CONTEST WILL END ON WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8th, 2012 AT 11:59PM. No Exceptions.**

EDIT: Thank you all for your wonderful submissions. As of right now, I'm going to put this on hold. Some people have had some great ideas about how to proceed, I realized I kind of rushed into this. I'm sorry I've cut some corners by only going to one company. I'm going to explore some options concerning printing and copyrighting. The order this needs to proceed now is this:

I'm going to find some other options for printing (Spin, Gaia, Savage, BreakMark, etc.).

Once I have a pretty good idea on limitations, I'm going to try this again, with the same contest layout, but perhaps through an external site. 

Once a design has been picked, I'll submit it to the powers that be (Reddit copyright gods) and see what they think.

The artist and I will make any changes necessary, and post the final product. 

The printing company will begin to take orders, and once the order period has ended, they will produce them.

Thanks you guys SO MUCH for all of the support this has garnered. I feel like this is a great way to express how we feel about reddit and ultimate. Stay tuned for updates, and keep thinking of designs!

Our community has been growing. We're up over 8400 subscribers, and even if our growth rate stays linear, we're due to hit 10000 before the end of the year.

I've been promising for a while now, so I'm proud to unveil our first cut at [community guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/wiki/rules).

We have several goals with these guidelines. We want to:

* Give people an idea of what to expect from this forum and its moderators
* Prevent our subreddit from devolving into non-ultimate related or very loosely related to ultimate nonsense
* Continue to keep our subreddit free from abuse of all kinds
* Clarify our spam policy

These rules are a draft, and are up for public discussion right now, so if you have questions, suggestions, disagreements, etc, put them below.

At the moment, I and the other mods moderate very little, mainly just removing spam and rare abusive/offensive comments.

The main difference you'll see going forward is that we're going to be aggressive in deleting jokes and memes. Our intent with this policy is to make /r/ultimate into a high-quality forum for discussing the sport, not a  place full of inside jokes.

If somebody is interested in running a weekly joke/meme thread, please let me know; I'm happy to tolerate that, but I'm not interested in it myself. (I'm going to leave Zoidberg alone (why not?) to celebrate the new guidelines. I would delete it tomorrow.)

This would also be a great place to suggest improvements to the subreddit! Please let everyone know your ideas.",,False,,t5_2qnym,False,,,True,t3_1jhukq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/1jhukq/introducing_rultimate_community_guidelines/,moderator

I'm waiting to hear back from FIVE about costs for a reorder, but the [original order](http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/p8x1j/reddit_jersey_order_being_placed_on_feb_7/) was **$35 (US) per jersey** (including $4 for shipping, which ended up actually costing closer to $6). Five **is able** to ship each jersey separately, for around $1.50. This is a big plus. 

[Ampro's badger jersey](http://www.amprosports.com/designer/Custom-Badger_2120.php) will cost around **$15** before shipping. This includes numbers on the back. Jenny tried to dissuade me from pursuing the option to have each jersey shipped separately (""that's not what we do best"" - but hey, they're a regular UPS stop...), but said it's possible. 

As far as I can tell, *either option would require all of the money up-front*. Kickstarter.com has been suggested as a possible way to collect money via a reliable third party. I'm open to any suggestions.

I went through the final stats for each team at D1 and D3 nationals (open and women) and calculated how often a team converts a possession into a score by dividing the number of goals by the number of possessions (goals + turnovers). The USAU stats are pretty thorough, but probably imperfect at best and I may have had made some mistakes along the way. Here are the averages for each division at nationals:

D1 Open: **49.6%** (High: Ohio-58.7%, Low: Washington-39.2%)

D1 Women: **34.5%** (High: OSU-45.6%, Low: Ottawa-22.5%)

D3 Open: **45.1%** (High: Wake Forest: 53.6%, Low: Brandeis-36.7%)

Many of social sport leagues seem to focus on coed leagues only, and single gender sport league are never as successful as coed (social aspect I guess).

What have you guys seen in your cities, college or teams, that has helped increase popularity of the sport among women, and in turn recruited more women to the sport? Has a women only league helped recruit more women who then crossover to coed?

First, we really appreciate that you all feel so strongly about sublimated kitty cat shorts.   We always appreciate it when people speak up about current or future products and this is no exception.  These shorts are subject of hot debate in our office right now.  If you really want them to be sublimated shorts sold in the online store, then read on.

The problem is twofold:
1. We can only produce sublimated shorts in large quantities
2. All the posting on Facebook is beginning to like trolling, so we aren't convinced of true demand for these shorts

To Fivers who actually make decisions about what to put in the online store it seems Facebook appears to be overrun with trols.  This is mostly because there are so many posts by just a few people, and everyone goes through and ""likes"" every post by other kitty cat people.  Even if this isn't trolling, there are only about 20-30 people asking for kitty cat shorts on our Facebook.  

We can only make sub shorts in very large quantities, and we would lose money if only 20-30 people buy them (and we'd be stuck with a bunch of left over kitty cat shorts), so this seems like a risky option to us right now.  If you want kitty cat shorts in the online store, you need to prove that we'll sell least a couple hundred pairs.  

Facebook posts are not a very reputable way to prove something like this.  The way we see it, it's easy for people to jump on the bandwagon and write a silly post, but when it comes to dropping $25 + shipping, we believe that demand will be much lower.  If you want to prove that there is demand for sublimated kitty cat shorts in the online store it would need to make people put their money where their mouths are, but we'll leave the brainstorming for that system up to you Redditors.

**Here's the good news**: if you want kitty cat shorts for your team or group of friends, we can make a team order of screen printed shorts with a cat on them!  The minimum order is 15 and screens only cost $2.50 each, so the bar is actually pretty low.  Plus we do free art, so you won't have come up with a design and shipping is free within the US.

I know that screen printing is not the same as a sublimated design, but I think it's your best shot for kitty cat shorts in the near term.

Again, thank you for your interest. Hopefully this will help you guys get organized and legitimately prove demand.

Good luck, and we'll see you on the field,

Christian
For the Five Team

Having attended several tournaments I've been fairly disappointed. I expected a level of professionalism, a little something extra that would be brought to tournaments that wouldn't be provided by a college team. Yes, the caps went off on time, yes the fields had cones and everyone got bagels but is that something a college team couldn't have done? Why are we taking these local tournaments out of the hands of colleges that often use them for fundraising? 

The tournaments I've been to felt very cookie-cutter, unoriginal and extremely bland. Nothing special was brought to the table. Often times college teams add something special (dance competitions at Centex, a steak dinner at Steakfest, Pineapples at D-1337) that make the tournament slightly different and unique from others. Why are we allowing this generic brand to come in and take over what makes our sport so unique?

I've also been disappointed with the way tournaments have been run, let's take a look at Atlantic City Invite this weekend (full disclosure, involved with a team attending). While the seeding isn't terrible it's definitely off and has changed 5 times in the last 24 hours. You'd think a professional company could have the schedule set by at least the monday beforehand (to take previous weekends results into account) and remember to look at head-head matchups as well as common opponents. Disappointed. And what about that schedule? Pools A, B are obviously power pools but losing either pool automatically kicks you out of the championship bracket? Seems like those teams on the brink would benefit (from a final standings position) of being in the lower pools and winning their way up against weaker teams (TL;DR no matter what two seeds from 13-20 will finish higher than two teams 1-12 making it impossible for seeding to hold).

It's also been brought to my attention that Ultiment is snatching up fields before college teams have a chance to book them making it impossible to host their annual tournaments. I understand it's a business with a first-come-first-served philosophy but booking fields for 1.5 months so local teams don't even have the option of hosting a tournament seems slightly ridiculous.

In the last 8 months or so I've had a growing sense that each time I see a highlight reel its mostly composed of D's on mediocre offense, goals scored by hucking to wide open receivers or layout catches to make up for bad throws.

As I see more and more videos like that I keep thinking that those really aren't highlights and they detract from the truly awe worthy plays.

So I'm curious:

Hit me up if your tryna win a championship or something idk if your in the position or not i just got asked to pitched for club baseball as well so my schedule for sports is tight but Id be able to make the games.

Backstory.

I'm a freshman at a school which is very, very competitive in ultimate.  I have almost no experience (pickup maybe 5 times before) but I've wanted to play, so I've gone to the pickup games for the past few days.  Playing against people who are infinitely better than me was hard, there was a while where I could make no plays, and my defense was flat out terrible.  But today, I finally made one decent play, one of those clusterfucky group throws where it goes up, and I just made the grab.  

That one play made all the difference, having people tell you things like 'nice play' boosted my confidence, my defense started improving, and I even made a couple decent cuts.

I've got a long ways to go, but for anyone having a hard time, it clicks eventually.  Keep trying your hardest until you get that one play, or several plays, even if you've had a dry streak.  Think about what you are doing and how to change it to make it better.  But above all, and even when you make a mistake, tuck your head down, and keep giving 100%.",,False,,t5_2qnym,False,,,True,t3_ki7ca,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/ki7ca/for_anyone_just_starting_to_play/,

The [MLU](http://www.youtube.com/user/MajorLeagueUltimate/videos), on the other hand, has tons of uploads, including full-game footage **for free**, highlights and interviews. Secondly, their footage is much better quality. It looks professional whereas the AUDL footage is hard to find and limited to shitty home camera stuff or highlight videos of the Windy City Wildfire AKA Brodie Smith funtime look-at-me team.

At first, I thought *How in the hell are they going to make this work? They're not even using a Discraft?* Now, I'm thinking *Wow, this is fun to watch!* The AUDL needs to step up their marketing strategy because MLU is really making it seem as if there won't be two professional leagues for long.

I'm struggling right now and need advice.  In my area, many schools have Varsity teams, but we are a club sport.  The team is only about five years old, and I have only been coaching for a year.  Because there is no ""incentive"" to play (students do not get ""sport"" recognition and do not receive PE exemptions in their schedule,) we average about 3-6 players per practice.  Those that are serious are quickly losing hope and motivation and are considering quitting the team.  We want to develop interest by scrimmaging with local high schools, but we barely have enough who are ready and willing to play.  We are green and struggling, and I fear we're on the verge of total collapse.  Please help with recommendations.  How can I develop interest in school and incentivize staying involved?  Many thanks.

Two weeks later, after failed phone calls and emails left unanswered, it became clear they had been defrauded and would never be seeing tickets nor their money. Somewhere in Mexico, someone had committed the biggest Spirit foul imaginable."""""" http://www.outwittingtheweasel.com/

I've played with quite a few of these girls through the *famoso* [Acapulco Hat tournaments](http://www.acapulcotournament.com/league.php?scriptName=HOME&amp;leagueID=9678), and know first hand how difficult it can be to earn money there.

[GDP - per capita (PPP): $15,100 (2011 est.)](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html) ... so imagine you get scammed out of ~10% of your year's salary trying to get to Japan for WUCC.

""How can you be so stupid?"" is a common question... let's just say that Travelocity and Orbitz don't make it a priority to sell tickets in Mexico and leave it at that.  The travel market is nowhere near as accessible as it is in the U.S. and the short of it is, the scammer bought 1-2 tickets ""correctly"", and walked with the money for the 9 others.

I'll say straight out, playing on the co-ed teams with these girls was the best experience I've ever had.  Many of them were better than me (just real solid throws and catches) and I've been playing for 10+ years.  Playing with them changed my perception of what co-ed ultimate could be like, and has definitely encouraged me to throw as frequently as possible to the women on our beer-league teams.

So, they're the real deal, and I'm super excited that they've ""gone back to zero"" and recouped what they've lost through donations.  It's still going to be a rough road, but I'm proud to be a part of a community that steps up to the plate like this and hopefully this helps you feel a little proud of the ultimate community at-large.",,False,,t5_2qnym,False,,,True,t3_tgu8q,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/tgu8q/you_like_feel_good_stories_9k_international/,

A. A pick can only be called if it occurred when the players were within 3 meters of each other

B. A pick can only be called if the defender is actively reacting to the offensive player

C. A pick can only be called BY the defender who is picked

D. A pick can only be called IMMEDIATELY

E. After a pick is called, the player picked can catch up the RELATIVE distance they lost.  This means that if you were 6 feet behind when you called the pick, you get to catch up to 6 feet behind.

F. After a pick is called, if the disc is returned to the thrower, everyone goes back to where they were when the call was made or when the throw was made, whichever was EARLIER, and *then* the picked player catches up.

G. ""Affects the play:"" if you call a pick, you must decide whether it affected the play or not.  If you were right behind and could have layed out to prevent a catch, then say ""affected the play,"" and the disc goes back.  If you were two steps behind and you weren't going to get there anyway, say ""didn't affect the play.""  You still get to catch up (remember, relative distance), but the disc stays with the receiver.  Why would you call a pick if it didn't affect the play?  So you can get the mark on quickly.  ~~If the pick didn't affect the play and *won't affect the next one*, just yell ""play on.""~~ Edit: as pointed out by epicmoustache, unless your team has possession after the result of the play, don't just yell ""play on.""  Play still stops, you just say ""didn't affect the play,"" catch up the relative distance lost, and play restarts with a check.

Citations:

IIG. Guarding: A defender is guarding an offensive player when they are within three meters of that offensive player and are reacting to that offensive player.

IIG(exp). A defender who turns away from an offensive player and begins focusing on and reacting to the thrower is no longer guarding that offensive player.

XVI.C.2.A.2. If the offense called the infraction after the thrower began the act of throwing or if the defense called the infraction, play continues un-halted . Players should announce ""play on.""

XVI.C.2.A.2(exp). There is no stoppage here! Continue playing and announce ""play on"" in this situation.

XVI.I.1. A pick occurs whenever an offensive player moves in a manner that causes a defensive player guarding an offensive player to be obstructed by another player. Obstruction may result from contact with, or the need to avoid, the obstructing player.

XVI.I.2. A pick can be called only by the obstructed player and must be announced by loudly calling ""pick"" immediately after it occurs.

XVI.I.3. ...the obstructed player is then allowed to move to recover the relative position lost because of the pick.

XVI.I.3(exp). ...if the disc is returned to the thrower, everyone resumes the locations they occupied at the earlier of the time of the throw or the time of the call.

XVI.I.3(exp). Then the picked defender catches up the relative position lost because of the pick. If he was trailing by 9 feet, then he gets to catch back up to 9 feet away, but does not get to set up right next to the offensive player.

It is a violation to call for the disc as a defensive player!  I've actually seen people throw to the other team.  If this happens to you *or a teammate of yours* (here I am especially thinking about your less experienced players), call ""Violation,"" even after you/they throw it.  Hold firm, and mention rule II.C. explicitly.

-----

Citations:

II.C. ...A defensive player may not ... call for a pass from the thrower.

II.U. Violation: Any infraction of the rules other than a foul.

XVI.A. An infraction may only be called by a player on the infracted team who recognizes that it has occurred, unless specified differently elsewhere. The player must immediately call ""violation"" or the name of the specific infraction loudly.

XVI.C.2.B.1. If the infraction affected the play (XVI.C.3), play stops and the disc reverts to the thrower unless the specific rule says otherwise.

XVI.C.3. An infraction affected the play if an infracted player determines that the outcome of the specific play (from the time of the infraction until play stops) may have been meaningfully different absent the infraction....

If a defensive player loses a catch block due to ground contact, it counts as a block, *not* an interception and a turnover.  This means if you're on defense and you layout, catch it firmly, and then lose it when you hit the ground, it's a block and your team gets the disc.  It's the same deal if you sky someone, and hitting them or the ground causes you to lose the disc.

However, if you catch the disc and *deliberately* put it down, or it's live or in play and you're on offense and you pick it up and put it back down, that *is* a turnover.  Likewise if you hand the disc to another player, *even if you're carrying it back from a bricked pull*.

II.F. Ground contact: All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being off-balance. Items on the ground are considered part of the ground.

II.O.2. Loss of possession due to ground contact related to a catch negates that player's possession up to that point.

XII.C. A pass is intercepted if a defensive player obtains possession of the disc, but if the defender accidentally loses possession of the disc before or during ground contact related to the catch, the pass is considered blocked rather than intercepted.

We have an hour practice and end with a 20 minute scrimmage (which is a terrible experience when every pass is a turnover).

But for the first 40 mins, we try to keep them active and occupied.  Right now we do:

 * Start with pairing up and throwing
 * Run a lap, stretch for a few mins
 * Throw the disc through a hula hoop
 * Run out and make an in-cut
 * Run in and make an out-cut
 * Throw with a mark (disaster)
 * One on one offense/defense (I throw)
 * Scrimmage(disaster)

If anyone has any experience with kids, input would be GREATLY appreciated.  We're not looking to build a team, it's just an after school program for kids.

You can read about Watterson's resistance to merchandising [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes#Merchandising).

The line is *out*.  If you are straddling the line, you are out-of-bounds.  If any part of you is touching the line when you gain control of the disc, you are out.  If you catch it in bounds, your momentum can take you out-of-bounds (running, diving, or falling) as long as the disc is fully under your control before any part of you touches out-of-bounds.  If you catch it while jumping, diving, or falling and bring the disc fully under control while still in the air, you are considered in bounds if your ""first point of contact"" is fully in bounds.

As everyone knows (and I hear they might be changing for the next rule edition) if you jump from in bounds, catch the disc, and throw it before you land out of bounds, it's legal and called a ""World's Greatest,"" or just ""Greatest.""  However, if you jump from out-of-bounds and catch it, it's considered out-of-bounds, even if you throw before you land or land in bounds.  This is because you transfer your in/out-of-bounds status to the disc when you catch it, and your in/out-of-bounds status changes when you land, not when you take off.

This applies only to catching.  Once you've established a pivot (which must be fully in bounds), it's perfectly legal to pivot out of bounds.

If the field is unlined (as most are at a low-medium level), the imaginary boundary line is *as thick as the markers*.  This means that when you're sighting the cones for in/out calls, the *inside edge* is what's important.  Cite rule II.J if challenged on this.

-----

Citations:

II.J. Line: A boundary defining the playing areas. On an unlined field, the boundary is an imaginary line segment between two field markers with the thickness of said markers....

IX.A. The entire playing field is in-bounds. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field and are out-of-bounds.

Seriously, I look goofy. 

I don't know how to throw convincing fakes, i'm afraid to not stare right at my receiver. haha it's bad.

Best perspective has no really quantitative description in the rules, but it is definitely *limited to onfield players*.  In general, I've mostly seen it used to refer to someone who was close, paying attention, and frequently able to sight down the sideline.

At training sessions, I throw passes just out of their reach to try to encourage them, but they never do. At games, I tell them that they need to lay for those discs just out of their reach. Their response?

""I know, but I just can't""

They say that they have a mental block, like they just don't process that it is a possibility at that moment in time. To be fair, I understand that flinging yourself out into space is a strange concept to non-ultimate players (what other sport do they really lay out in?), but it is a necessary skill for high level play. When they mention that they just don't think of it, I tell them that when I lay out, it's not planned. If laying out is what needs to happen to get my hand to the disc, it happens.

My question is, how do I help them past that mental hurdle? How do I get laying out into someone's arsenal? Any help would be appreciated, as since I am currently on IR all I am doing at training sessions is working with new players.

It'd be awesome to trade with someone from here because it's an awesome little community we've got going. The Jersey is made by UK company Lookfly and is size M. It's a really nice jersey and the size is pretty nice. I'm 6'4 and it fits perfectly, maybe a tiny bit short.

Let me know what you think anyway! Cheers!

Edit! I completely forgot that I also have a spare paid of shorts from the summer, also Ireland gear. They're lookfly size L and they're really nice. Pic coming.

But I landed pretty hard, with me ending up curled up in pain. I could barely move for a good 30 seconds. The main places that hurt were my upper chest and abdominal area. Based on what I've seen though, people who lay out just get back up, wipe off their shirt and keep playing. Is there a way to minimize the impact on the ground? Or do I just keep practicing until I get used to it? Because if so, I might just give up on the idea of laying out.. My chest hurts just thinking about earlier today.

1317649092.0,28,self.ultimate,kzbzi,Phred's rules series #5: States of Play,35,7,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/kzbzi/phreds_rules_series_5_states_of_play/,"[(introduction)](http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/kva96/phreds_rules_series_introduction/)

There are three states of play: In Play, Live, and Dead.

In play: once the disc has been pulled/checked in, it's in play until it goes out of bounds, there's a dispute, or an infraction.  It is still in play after a turnover unless it goes out of bounds.

Live: Players can move around at will, but the thrower may *not* throw until he's put the disc into play.  To do so, the thrower establishes a pivot (where the disc was if he's picking it up), and touches the disc to the ground.  You *do not have to offer the disc to the other team for a check* if the disc is live.

* A disc is live following a turnover if it landed, was caught, or rolled out of bounds.  It is also live if it is turned over in the endzone.  Hustle (or saunter) it back to the line, establish a pivot and touch it to the ground.

* If the disc lands or rolls out of bounds on a pull, the disc is live.  You do not have to offer a check when you put it in, and if you drop it bringing it back, it's a turnover!  (I have never seen that enforced, but it's explicit in the rules).

* When bringing a live disc to the front of the endzone to put into play (if it went out of bounds in the endzone, was turned over in the endzone, or a pull rolled out of bounds in the endzone), you again needn't check it in, just touch it to the ground.  You must walk straight up to the endzone line from where the disc came to rest or went out of bounds, but you are free to sprint or to saunter (if you saunter too slowly beware of delay-of-game calls, which will be covered in a separate post).

Dead: After something more interesting happends, the disc is dead.  Players are not allowed to move around (or must reposition themselves afterward) and restarting play requires a check.  There can *never* be a turnover while the disc is dead.

* Foul calls, violation calls, travel calls, pick calls, stall calls, time-outs (including technical and injury), and *discussions* result in a dead disc.

* To emphasize this point, if a newer player requires an explanation of something, the disc is dead.  If there is a rules dispute, the disc is dead.  If the teams cannot agree who had best perspective, the disc is dead.  Your team cannot turn it over while you are arguing about a play!

* An offensive check is either the traditional offering of the disc to the defender, or if one is not within reach, a touch on the ground and the loud announcement ""in play.""  To self-check, the defense must first acknowledge readiness!

*  Occasionally, a dead disc comes back into play with no offensive player starting in possession.  This requires a defensive self-check, which is just like an offensive self check with the roles reversed and no pivot (just put the disc on the ground and the defender doesn't have to touch it).

The Continuation Rule will be its own post, as will the stall count after a check.

-----

Citations:

R.1. A disc is in play when play may proceed without the defense's acknowledgment. An in-bounds disc on the playing field is in play. The disc is subject to a turnover. To put the disc into play at a particular spot on the field means to establish a pivot at that spot.

II.R.2. A disc is live when players are allowed to move and the disc is subject to a turnover, but the thrower cannot make a legal pass (e.g., walking the disc to the spot where it is to be put into play). For a live disc to be put into play, the thrower must establish a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, touch the disc to the ground, and put the disc into play.

II.R.3. A disc is dead when play has stopped and can continue only with a check. The disc is not subject to a turnover.

II.S. Stoppage of play: Any halting of play due to a call, discussion, or time-out that requires a check or self-check to restart play....

II.S(exp). Play-halting calls include ""foul"", ""violation"", ""travel,"" ""pick,"" ""stall"", etc.

VII.9. After a pull, whichever player takes possession of the disc must put it into play. If a player drops the disc while carrying it to the spot where it is to be put into play and it contacts the ground before the thrower regains possession, the other team gains possession of the disc at the spot on the playing field proper nearest to the drop.

VII.10. There is no stoppage of play when putting the pull into play. If the disc is to be put into play at a location other than where possession was gained, the thrower starts play by touching the disc to the ground after establishing a pivot at the spot on the playing field where the disc is to be put into play.

VIII.D.3.a. The marker restarts play by touching the disc in the thrower's possession. If the thrower attempts a pass before the marker checks the disc, the pass (whether complete or incomplete) does not count and the thrower regains possession.

VIII.D.4. Offensive Self-check: If play is to restart with a check, but no defensive player is near enough to touch the disc in the thrower's hand, play restarts with an offensive self-check. To restart play using an offensive self-check:
		a. the defense must acknowledge readiness; and
		b. the thrower establishes a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, touches the disc to the ground and loudly announces ""in play.""

VIII.D.4(exp). Determine this distance [the distance that requires an offensive self-check] based on the thrower standing upright and extending the disc toward the marker.

VIII.D.5. Defensive self-check: If play is to restart with a check, but no offensive player is in possession of the disc at the appropriate spot, play restarts with a defensive self-check. To restart play using a defensive self-check:
		a. the disc is placed at the appropriate spot on the field;
		b. the offense must acknowledge readiness; and
		c. the defender closest to the disc loudly announces ""in play.""

X.A. If a turnover results in a team gaining possession in the end zone that they are defending, the player in possession must immediately either:
		1. put the disc into play at the spot of the disc (to fake a throw or pause after gaining possession commits the player to put the disc into play at that spot); or
		2. Carry the disc directly to the closest point on the goal line and put it into play at that spot. If this option is chosen, the player taking possession must put the disc into play at the goal line. Failure to do so is a travel.

X.A.2(exp). The player may carry the disc at any speed, constant or variable, while not unreasonably delaying

XIII.B. For a live disc to be put into play, the thrower must establish a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, touch the disc to the ground, and put it into play.

XIII.D. If a dispute arises concerning an infraction or the outcome of a play (e.g., a catch where no one had a good perspective), and the teams cannot come to a satisfactory resolution, play stops, and the disc is returned to the thrower and put into play with a check (VIII.D), with the count reached plus one or at six if over five.

XIX.D. If a dispute arises on the field, play stops and is restarted with a check when the matter is resolved.

XIX.E. If a novice player commits an infraction out of sincere ignorance of the rules, it should be common practice to stop play and explain the infraction.

EDIT: Fixed the distinction between in play and live following a turnover.  Thanks, Emanon.",,False,,t5_2qnym,True,,,True,t3_kzbzi,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/kzbzi/phreds_rules_series_5_states_of_play/,

We could do something like best article of the past year, best ultimate website, best photo, best highlight, best fulll game video, best logo, best team name, best team website, etc. We could have a category as a comment with people making nominations as a reply to it and upvotes and downvotes can determine the winner. It might make more sense to take the top two upvoted in each category and have a runoff. We would end up with an amazing resource with the best examples of every part of ultimate that could serve as a great collection of best practices. 

I thought of this idea because a friend of mine is trying to develop a website for her women's team and I was considering posting a thread to gather the best ultimate websites to draw inspiration from. I then realized it would be awesome to be able to see the best example of all aspects of ultimate. I love sharing and using best practices and I think there's a ton of room for sharing them in the ultimate community with the [college women resources](http://cwuresources.texasultimate.org/) page being the best example.

I know Skyd already does their own best of but I don't think it would hurt to have a seperate community generated list.

What do people think?

EDIT: Just to be clear this wouldn't be the actual voting thread but a discussion of whether enough people would be interested in participating to make doing it worthwhile and for it to be a somewhat decent representation of /r/ultimate.",,False,,t5_2qnym,1352327876.0,,,True,t3_12tiwe,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/12tiwe/rultimate_awards/,

We are Zach Weiss (former AMP player), Zac Hilton (former Bashing Pinatas player) and Elliott Isaac (former Prion player) and we want to let you know about a new club mixed team that will be forming out of Charlottesville this season.

Below are the dates and times of our events:

Competitive Scrimmage on Sunday, May 5 from noon to 2 PM in Charlottesville
Competitive Scrimmage on Sunday, May 19 from noon to 2 PM in Charlottesville
Open Tryouts on Saturday, June 1 from 10 AM to 2 PM in Charlottesville
Open Tryouts on Sunday, June 2 from 10 AM to 2 PM in Charlottesville
Open Tryouts on Saturday, June 8 from 10 AM to 2 PM in Charlottesville

We are currently in the process of obtaining field space for these events, but they will most likely be held at [Carr's Field or Madison Bowl Field](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204966597499905249057.0004d87b17b52e9d65c28&amp;msa=0) on the University of Virginia grounds. There is parking available nearby at the Culbreth Road Parking Garage, which is also pinned on the map.

The competitive scrimmages are not required, but if you can make it out then we'd love to have you. They are a chance for us to see everyone and have some fun playing high level ultimate before our official tryout period.

If you plan on coming to one or more of our events, or if you'd just like to be kept in the loop on team developments throughout the tryout process, please fill out this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Yv1t32YiAtHIAFp-cRzCdtnp2BdZTUWqGTH4wjiKvow/edit). We'd love to see you at all of our events, but we understand that might not be possible. Just let us know if you have a conflict and can't make it.

If you have any thoughts or questions, feel free to email us at zach.l.weiss@gmail.com, zachary.a.hilton@gmail.com, or elliott.w.isaac@gmail.com. We hope to see you there.

First and most important, *TDs often mess with this*.  If the tournament you're at says ""one TO a half plus a floater, no TOs after soft cap,"" that's the rule and you best follow it.  Here are the rules if nothing else is specificied:

1. Each team has 2 team time-outs per half.  They don't carry over.

2. Overtime starts when the losing team ties it up one point short of the game total (14-14 in a game to 15, for example).  Caps do *not* affect when overtime starts.  As an example, if you're playing a game to 11 when the soft cap goes off and they set a point cap at 9, overtime will never occur in this game; it would start at 10-10, but as soon as the leading score 9 the game is over; overtime doesn't begin at 8-8.  When overtime occurs, *all remaining time-outs are thrown out* and each team gets one more.

3. If you call an injury, you must either leave play or use up a team time-out, *unless you were injured by someone on the other team*.  This rule is often ignored or misapplied.

4. After a goal is scored before the pull, any of the 14 players on the field can call time-out (although you can't call timeout between a pull and a re-pull).  After a pull, only the thrower in possession can call a time-out.  They do so by making a ""T"" with their hand and the disc and saying ""time-out.""

5. If you call time-out and you don't have one, it's a turnover and a dead disc.

-----

Citations:

V.C. Overtime begins when the score is tied at one goal less than the game total (e.g., in a game with a game total of 15 goals, overtime begins when the score reaches 14-14).

V.C(exp). Overtime begins based on the predetermined game total and is unaffected by time caps. If a time cap applies and makes it a ""game to 14,"" then when the score reaches 13-13, it will not be overtime.

VI.B. Team Time-out: Each team has two team time-outs per half in a standard game.

VI.B.1. Each team has exactly one team time-out in overtime, regardless of whether any time-outs remain from regulation.

VI.B.3. Any player may call a time-out after a goal is scored and before both teams have signaled readiness to start play. Time limit counts between points are suspended for 70 seconds. A time-out may not be called between a re-pull call and the ensuing pull.

VI.B.4. After the pull, only a thrower with possession of the disc that has survived ground contact can call a time-out. The player must form a ""T"" with one hand and the disc, and should audibly say ""time-out."" The time-out begins when the T is formed. The disc is then placed on the ground at the pivot spot.

VI.B.5.c. The player who had possession of the disc when the team time-out was called restarts play with a check at the pivot spot, and the marker resumes the stall count with the word ""stalling"" followed by the last number uttered before the time-out plus one or 9 if over 8...

VI.C.4. If the injured player does not leave the game after an injury time-out, that player's team is charged with a team time-out unless the injury was caused by an opposing player....",,False,,t5_2qnym,True,,,True,t3_l4a89,http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/l4a89/phreds_rules_series_10_timeouts/,
