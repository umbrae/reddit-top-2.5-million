Total lie. They are laying off 50 people, not 200, and have been slowly closing their operations down since Sept. 11, 2011. So they announced the company will be closed by 2015 in 2011:

 **Research in Motion Ltd - 3,000**


These layoffs were announced in June of 2012. Not because of the economy but because they create a product that has lost demand since other competitors have sold more goods:
http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2012/11/08/research-in-motion-cuts-jobs-at-irving-headquarters/

**Lightyear Network Solutions - 15**


These aren't layoffs...they are permanent in an effort to downsize a company that has been losing money for a long time. 
http://www.wkyt.com/wymt/home/headlines/Company-lays-off-workers-in-Pikeville-177766221.html

**Providence Journal - 23**


This is a newspaper that has seen its circulation decline from 90,085 to 83,733 in a year's time. They have been regularly laying off employees like every other newspaper across the country as less Americans get their news from newspapers and choose to get it free from the Internet and television: 
http://www2.turnto10.com/business/2012/nov/08/providence-journal-announces-more-layoffs-ar-1233784/

 **Hawker Beechcraft - 410**

This company declared bankruptcy last year and sold to a chinese company in July of 2011. This recent round of layoffs was 170 people and their business has been in decline since 2008. They make luxury private jets for rich people and I'm assuming the rich can only own a certain amount of private luxury jets at one time:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120802/us-hawker-beechcraft-layoffs/


 **Boeing 61,000**

Boeing expanded it's business dramatically during the Iraq war with HUGE contracts with the defense department. As the war came to a close, they saw their business decline. I guess if you want constant war, Boeing would always be making billions from the government but this is their official statement: ""Boeing said the changes were *not* a response to the threat of additional, across-the-board U.S. budget cuts due to take effect on January 2, or the outcome of U.S. elections, but represented another step in its continuing drive to ""be more competitive while investing in technologies and people.""
So the company itself is deying it has anything to do with the presidential elections and that they layoffs were planned and expected:
http://www.catholic.org/business/story.php?id=48428

 **CVPH Medical Center - 17**

This hospital received $3.2 million dollars in federal grant money to keep their doors open but their expenses exceeded their revenues by more than $400,000. They simply don't know how to run a business apparently. 
http://www.cvph.org/news-and-events/news-detail.aspx?newsid=45

 **US Cellular - 980**

This was the result of a sale of a company to a competitor. Sprint (cell phone company) purchased US Cellular to eliminate a competitor in a certain market. This was a planned sale that took place over the past month, it just happened to be announced on Wednesday. It takes longer than one day to sell a mult-million dollar company:
http://www.wirelessweek.com/News/2012/11/carriers-Sprint-Buys-US-Cellular-Midwest-Markets-for-480M/

 **Commerzbank - 6,000**

This is the funniest one so far. This is a bank from Germany and Poland that has absolutely no connection to the U.S. or Obama In looking for official layoff reports, I found this statement from the bank from Nov. 8 where they announced they are investing $2 BILLION euros in their company. Sounds like growth to me.
https://www.commerzbank.com/en/hauptnavigation/presse/pressemitteilungen/archiv1/2012/quartal_12_04/presse_archiv_detail_12_04_9794.html

 **Iberia - 7,000**

This is the second funniest because it's an airline out of SPAIN that has no connections (or jobs) to the U.S. Spain's economy has been sinking harder that the U.S. since 2007. Absolutely no connection to America or Obama:
http://www.theworld.org/2012/11/spains-iberia-airlines-announces-layoffs/

 **Momentive Performance Materials - 150**

This is a TEMPORARY LAYOFF. All of these jobs will be reinstated in two weeks, as reported by the owner of the company here:
http://www.tylerstarnews.com/page/content.detail/id/508789/Momentive-Inc--plans-temporary-layoffs-for-150.html?nav=5008

 **Brake Parts, LLC - 75**

These layoffs were disclosed on Oct. 29. I'm afraid that was a full week BEFORE Obama's re-election. Absolutely no connection here:
http://www.tylerstarnews.com/page/content.detail/id/508789/Momentive-Inc--plans-temporary-layoffs-for-150.html?nav=5008

 **Gameforge Berlin - 20**

I'm not even looking this up. If people are stupid and desperate enough to blame Obama for the layoff of 20 people in Berlin, Germany, they are idiots. But then again, I wonder if they even realize that Berlin is in Germany and not in America. Probably not.

 **Vestas Wind Systems 1,700**

Huge lie. First sentence in this story reports the layoffs to be 200 and not 1,700. Blatant lie there. It should be noted that this is a company from Denmark and not an American company. EDIT: I stand corrected on this as I found a quote from the article: *The combined layoffs, plus some attrition and relocations, have reduced Vestas' Colorado workforce from 1,700 to 1,200 this year.* So we can assume the total number of employees is 1,700 (the amount the email suggests was laid off) and that the numbers laid off amount to 500.
http://www.denverpost.com/recommended/ci_21754574

 **Husqvarna - 390**

This is a company based in Sweden, again absolutely no connection to Obama or the U.S. In fact, the  majority of those affected are in Sweden or where their products are made in Poland:
http://www.appliancemagazine.com/news.php?article=1626614&amp;zone=0&amp;first=1

**Ericsson - 14,000**

This is another funny one. Ericsson is a Swedish company (like Husqvarna) and those layoffs are in Sweden. They are not 14,000, they are 1,550. Pretty big difference:
http://www.i4u.com/2012/11/sony-ericsson/ericsson-swedens-job-announces-cuts

 **SRA International - 222**

Another blatant lie. These layoffs were planned, (like another one) on October 29, 2012. A full week before Obama was re-elected. Here is all the info to prove that:
http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/11/06/sra-international-to-lay-off-222-in.html

 **PerkinElmer - 75**

This company is moving operations overseas to save money on having to pay Americans a livable wage. The governor of MA tried to talk them into keeping the jobs in America but the company refused to discuss it with them before making the decision to outsource their jobs:
http://articles.courant.com/2012-01-18/business/hc-perkinelmer-layoffs-20120118_1_transfer-jobs-perkinelmer-global-stage

 **Majestic Star Casino and Hotel - 80**

THIS is a company trying to destroy their union. Their workers are in a union and their contract ran out Oct. 31st. The company has made more money this year than they did last year but they are still cutting jobs despite making more money. A quote from the union representative: “These out-of-state owners who control billions are coming to Indiana and taking away our jobs,” said Coleman. It is also worth mentioning that these layoffs were *announced* on Nov. 6th *before* the election was officially over and anyone knew who won.

http://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/lake/16200678-418/layoffs-hit-garys-majestic-star.html

 **Center for Hospice NY - 80**

TOTAL LIE: This company is renovating its current location and these layoffs will occur NEXT YEAR and they will be TEMPORARY according to the person in charge:
http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121106/CITYANDREGION/121109477/1002

**Bristol-Myers - 500**

Numbers are wrong. It's 470 and everyone agrees that this is the direct result of mismanagement under CEO Lamberto Andreotti...quote from the story: ""nominee for worst chief executive of the year.""
http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/bristol-myers-slash-480-sales-related-jobs-nj/2012-11-06

**Lower Bucks Hospital - 500**

This is one of the biggest lies: THIRTY people were laid off. 30. Not 500. And the layoffs occurred on NOV.5, THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. People who believe this stuff are idiots. Ironically, the CEO mentions in this article that they have **750** people on the payroll. Eliminating 500 of those seems kind of out of the question.

http://levittown.patch.com/articles/lower-bucks-hospital-lays-off-30-employees

 **Oce North America - 9**

I couldn't find a single news article to back this up with any kind of facts at all. Enough said.

 **Corning United Blood Services Gulf - 150**

Again, there is absolutely not a single news story to back this claim up anywhere. If it happened, there would be a press release. Right wing blogs are announcing this with NO reference or citation.

 **Atlantic Lottery Corporation - 16**

This is a Canadian company and these layoffs were announced NOV. 5th, a DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION.
http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2012/11/05/nb-atlantic-lotto-layoffs.html 

 **Welch Allyn - 10% of manufacturing work force**

These layoffs were announce on September 10th, almost two full months before Obama was re-elected. These are going to take place over THE NEXT THREE YEARS in a restructuring effort:
http://www.qmed.com/news/welch-allyn-initiates-global-restructuring-including-layoffs

 **Dana Holding - 12% of work force**

This is a total lie as well. The company released a financial report on Oct. 29th, 2012 and only said they were considering layoffs with NO specific numbers mentioned. The only place I can find this is on rightwing blogs, again, with no citations or references to any specifics. The company's report on Oct. 29th announced NO layoffs.
http://thurbersthoughts.blogspot.com/2012/10/dana-considering-layoffs-as-obamacare.html

 **Stryker - approx 5%**

These were announced on June 25, 2012  and it's in response to trying to compensate for a new 2.3% tax on medical devices as part of the new health care act. I don't have to tell you how little 2.3% is and there is also no indiction that it would be 5% of it's employee force. The latest news says 'more than 100' positions would be laid off.
http://www.massdevice.com/news/stryker-begin-new-york-layoffs-ahead-medical-device-tax-wall-street-beat

 **Boston Scientific - Unspecific (sic) amount**

These were announced in AUGUST and were a direct result of a change in management and a new CEO.
http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/29/us-bostonscientific-layoffs-idUSBRE87S0Z120120829

 **Medtronic - 1,000**

ANNOUNCED SEPTEMBER 6TH, 2012 as a result of the company restructuring plan.
http://www.massdevice.com/news/layoffs-medtronic-cut-another-500-jobs-hopes-saving-125m-year

 **Smith &amp; Nephew - 80**

This company is based in LONDON and these job cuts in Memphis were announced in September. This is the only real story I could find about it:
http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/ArticleEmail.aspx?id=64753

 **Abbott Labs - 550**

Announced on October 17th, about TWO SOLID WEEKS before Obama was re-elected. The facts hurt, I guess: Half of these workers being laid off are in EUROPE. Even though they are laying these people off, the overall amount of workers at Abbott Labs has grown due to additional acquisitions of other companies. Full story here:
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/abbott-labs-cuts-550-jobs-more-layoffs-planned-2012-10-17

 **Covidien - 600**

This is funny. The company denies any reports of layoffs in May of this year, no real news of layoffs since then:
http://www.thesunchronicle.com/mansfield/covidien-denies-layoffs-report/article_a55f54db-b925-5b86-b246-136f2178e487.html?mode=story

 **Kinetic Concepts - 300**

This was announced on JULY 13th, 2012 as part of restructuring after a $6.3 billion dollar buyout in 2011.
http://www.massdevice.com/news/report-kinetic-concepts-lays-300-more

**St. Jude - 300**

This was announced NOV. 2, FOUR DAYS before Obama was re-elected. I wonder if Romney would have won if these lunatics would be blaming Romney for the job losses that occurred 4 days before anyone knew who was going to be the next president: It should also be noted that the company blames poor sales of defibrillators and pacemakers, not on the economy.
http://www.startribune.com/business/176871351.html?refer=y

 **Hill Rom - 200**

This is ANOTHER company where the right wing blogs continue to report a layoff in these numbers (200) where there is absolutely no real news source or citation for this. Repeating something over and over doesn't make it true. Just look at Fox: They said Romney would be elected for the past month 1,000 times. Didn't make it so. I would put a source but since there is no source for this, I will leave it alone

 **Darden Restaurants - 3%**

This is the company that owns Red Lobster and the Olive Garden. All they are doing is cutting back hours so they aren't forced to cover employees' medical insurance. Typical big business: Just like Walmart: Wring your workers out for all you can get, work them JUST under the amount of hours where they would be provided some kind of health care security. Just a shitty company more than anything else but no reflection of the election at all but more of an attack on the new healthcare law.

 **JANCOA - 350**

Utter lies. Jancoa is a janitorial outfit in Cincinnati, OH whose owner testified against the new health care law in congress. Funny that this reports she is laying off 350 workers when the owner herself REPORTS THAT THE ENTIRE COMPANY EMPLOYS 320 PEOPLE. Absolutely no layoffs reported anywhere from this company as of Nov. 9, 2012. Maybe it's republicans' wishful thinking?

Hear me out.",476,117,326,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/12ogrk/republicans_of_reddit_consider_voting_for_gary/,"I am so fed up with the politics and candidates that the Republican party has been pursuing for the last several years.  I wish I could still call myself a Republican but I just can't do it anymore.

Practically every post on Reddit I see from a Republican says something like ""I wish the Republicans would focus more on fiscal responsibility and free trade, not so much on culture and class wars, not so much on god, guns, and gays.""  Well guess what?  The Libertarian party is all about that.

I'm pretty sure Obama has this election in the bag and always has.  But even if you think it's still close, ask yourself, even as a conservative, do I really want Mitt Romney as President?  He has said nothing specific and has only thrown out soundbites on both sides of every issue, just saying whatever he can to give Fox news a good show and keep people angry enough to vote for him.

I'm not saying I expect or even really want a true Libertarian President any time soon.  And I'm not affiliated with Johnson at all.  But a message needs to be sent to the Republican Party.  Get back to conservative economic policy.  Stop focusing so much on stoking people's hatred.  Give us real thinkers and leaders as candidates.  Stop letting Fox news bully you into doing whatever gives them ratings, and go back to caring about the people of this country, *all 100% of them.*

It was just a few years ago that Republicans had control of government in this country like never before.  President, both houses, majority of governors, and so on.  I was so hopeful that it would usher in a new era of rational, conservative government.  And what was the first thing they did?  Made a national spectacle out of the issue of euthanasia.  And it's been downhill from there.  They are out of control now, losing seats and favor as they veer off into more and more crazy outlandish tactics and sink lower and lower into what they'll abuse and exploit just to get people to vote angry.

If Gary Johnson got a small but significant percentage of votes, even if it wasn't the determining factor in the election, it would still send the right message.  It would let both parties know, especially the Republicans, that people are fed up with the Republicans promising financial freedom but only delivering blue laws, while the Demcrats promise civil freedoms but only deliver on redistribution.  It would force them to to actually deliver on the issues that most conservatives, moderates, and Republicans actually want to see from their government.  Make the Republican Party want to earn your vote back, and show them how they can do it.

So tomorrow, Republicans, vote Libertarian.  It really isn't throwing your vote away.

EDIT:  Fox News is already reporting that Romney lost because he wasn't conservative enough.  This is crazy.  It's going to keep getting worse.  The Republican party is going to keep getting crazier, moderate Republicans will keep voting for them because they ""don't want to throw their vote away,"" and meanwhile the Democrats will keep winning and will be able to get more and more liberal.  Republicans need to stop letting their party bend to the will of Fox News, and send a message that we want moderate conservatism without the social agenda, not crazy rape theories and gay-bashing.

It used to be that I could come here and actually learn a bit, or at least hear viewpoints that I did not previously consider. These are fewer and more far between. In their place are childish posts about how terrible one party is, but my party is so awesome and better.

I loved this place because it brought intelligent Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, and all kinds of other people together to think about the issues and discuss them thoroughly. I find myself coming here less often because that discussion isn't as frequent.

1350496680.0,267,self.PoliticalDiscussion,11n2vs,"Mitt Romney's answer to ""How are you different from George Bush"" ",340,73,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/11n2vs/mitt_romneys_answer_to_how_are_you_different_from/,"Mitt Romney was asked the question: ""Since both you and President Bush are Republicans, I fear a return to the policies of those years should you win this election. What is the biggest difference between you and George W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself from George W. Bush?"" 

I broke down the 4 parts of his answer, and compared them to statements from George W. Bush.  Here is how different they are:


&gt;I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else. That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.

**-Mitt Romney**


&gt;Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. And here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction is through technology...Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025. By applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a petroleum- based economy and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.

**-George W. Bush, 2006 State of the Union.**


&gt;Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't. I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America. It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.

**-Mitt Romney**

&gt; My administration will foster democracy and level barriers to trade. If elected, my goal will be free trade agreements with all the nations of Latin America. We can do so in cooperation with our NAFTA partners. We should also do so with Chile, and Brazil and Argentina, the anchor states of Mercosur. We will also work toward free trade with the smaller nations of Central America and the Caribbean.

**-George W. Bush, reported by AP, Oct 31, 2000**


&gt;Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didn't. President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years. He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large. So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.

**-Mitt Romney**


&gt;We must balance the federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need to do is impose spending discipline. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009--and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years.


**-George W. Bush, 2007 State of the Union Address**


&gt;And then let's take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small business. That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down on small business. I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.

**-Mitt Romney**


&gt;We cut the taxes on the small business owners.	If you want the small business sector to grow, if you recognize two-thirds of new jobs are created by small businesses, it makes sense to let small businesses keep more of the money they make. After all, when a small business owner has got more money in his or her treasury, you're likely to expand your business. You talk to some of these business -- the folks who won the business award, I said, how many jobs -- how many employees did you have five years ago and how many do you have today?

**-George W. Bush, Addressing Small Business Week Conference, April 16, 2006**

**EDIT**  Okay many of you are saying the exact same thing, so I'll address it here.  This is not meant to simply show that George Bush and Mitt Romney are similar based on the quotes.  Yes, one could probably do something similar with any two candidates by taking quotes out of context.  BUT Romney's quotes here are in the specific context of **differentiating** himself from George W., that was the question to which he was responding.  I'm simply showing how he failed to differentiate himself at that specific time.

* actual fact checks, e.g. Senator's Smiths latest ad is misleading
* requests for fact checks, e.g. Request to fact check Senator's Smith's claim that he has lowered taxes for all his constituents.

Let me know if you have any other ideas.

1347540693.0,234,self.PoliticalDiscussion,ztiew,Reviewing all of the current reported facts around the YouTube trailer that incited the Libyan embassy incident. Something seems to be very suspicious here.,282,48,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ztiew/reviewing_all_of_the_current_reported_facts/,"I've been reading every article I can find about this incident and trying to piece together the facts. Based on what I've been reading, I'm strongly starting to suspect that this YouTube film itself was part of a larger incitement plan. I'm not sure to what extent and how it might be connected but there are some startling questions raised.

Here are the key reported facts about the film itself:

* The cast and crew stated that a man going by the alias ""Bacile"" and claiming to be an Israeli Jew told them they were making a historical drama. The director is at the time claimed in [the Craiglist casting post](http://www.mooncasting.com/us/casting-feature-desert-warrior-los-angeles/) to be someone named ""Alan Roberts.""


* The crew and cast stated [the involvement of several middle eastern men in the initial production:](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1255908--does-sam-bacile-really-exist-innocence-of-muslims-director-could-be-coptic-christian-with-a-checkered-past)
&gt;Klein said he didn’t know the real name of the man he called “Sam,” who came to him for advice on First Amendment issues. About 15 key players from the Middle East — people from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan and Iran, and a couple of Coptic Christians from Egypt — worked on the film, Klein said.


* Despite their involvement, the cast is selected to be largely white Americans without any particular formal acting training appearing in brown face make up.


* The actors are given alternate fake scripts that feature scenes that would visually match the inflammatory sequences but carefully packaged to completely conceal the film's content. Every effort is made by the 'producers' to hide, deceive, and trick the cast and crew from the actual intent and plan of what is actually being created. After several scenes are recorded with these actors, [the scenes are manipulated and re-dubbed to recast it into a blatant anti-Islamic caricature mocking the prophet Mohammed](http://gawker.com/5942748). 


* These scenes are cobbled together into a 14 minute YouTube video, but it is unclear at this time if an actual full film really exists or the entire effort was to manufacture the short YouTube clip. [There are now major doubts whether it was ever intended to be an actual film or some kind of larger hoax.](http://theweek.com/article/index/233263/does-the-movie-that-provoked-the-libyan-slayings-even-exist) Further doubts are cast when [claims that it was once screened in Hollywood fail to check out.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/world/middleeast/origins-of-provocative-video-shrouded.html?_r=3&amp;hp&amp;pagewanted=all)
&gt;He said the film had been shown at a screening at a theater “100 yards or so” from Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood over the summer, drawing what he suggested was a depressingly small audience. He declined to specify what theater might have shown it, and theater owners in the vicinity of the busy strip said they had no record of any such showing.


* When news begins to break and reporters attempt to contact someone named ""Bacile,"" [the man via phone impersonating him tells any reporter who will listen that the movie was created at the behest of ""100 Israeli Jews"" who gave him ""5 million dollars.""](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/09/12/161003427/what-we-know-about-sam-bacile-the-man-behind-the-muhammad-movie)  No evidence of any kind supporting this claim has been found.


* The man impersonating Bacile is revealed to be Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, an Egyptian man living in California. He pleaded no contest in 2010 to federal bank fraud charges and served 21 months in federal prison. [He has been operating under several pseudonyms. Federal court papers show Mr Nakoula’s aliases include Nicola Bacily, Erwin Salameh and others.] (http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/jewish-director-of-prophet-muhammed-film-sam-bacile-may-be-alias-of-egyptian-fraud-convict-8134746.html)


* When confronted by an AP reporter he continues to claim that Bacile is a real person who is a Jewish Israeli and further claims that he himself is a Coptic Christian.
&gt;""Nakoula denied he had posed as Bacile. During a conversation outside his home, he offered his driver's license to show his identity but kept his thumb over his middle name, Basseley. Records checks by the AP subsequently found the name 'Basseley' and other connections to the Bacile persona.


* Two key players in this drama, Terry Jones and Sam Klein say that they were contacted by this man under his alias and asked to distribute and promote this film. Both are known for anti-Muslim rhetoric and Jones himself is known for inciting violence through past incidents. This is what helped create the massive confusion about whether the film was created by Coptics or Terry Jones or whoever. It now appears clear that all of those people were brought in after the creation of the video, spoke only briefly with Bacile, and were told to promote the video at a certain time. [They also appear to have been misled about the identity of the real creators:](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/muhammad-film-consultant-sam-bacile-is-not-israeli-and-not-a-real-name/262290/)
&gt;Klein told me that Bacile, the producer of the film, is not Israeli, and most likely not Jewish, as has been reported, and that the name is, in fact, a pseudonym. He said he did not know “Bacile”‘s real name. He said the man who identified himself as Bacile asked him to help make the anti-Muhammad film. When I asked him to describe Bacile, he said: “**I don’t know that much about him. I met him, I spoke to him for an hour.** He’s not Israeli, no. I can tell you this for sure, the State of Israel is not involved, Terry Jones (the radical Christian Quran-burning pastor) is not involved. **His name is a pseudonym. All these Middle Eastern folks I work with have pseudonyms. I doubt he’s Jewish. I would suspect this is a disinformation campaign.**”


* Both men are asked to promote the YouTube video around the date of the attacks, 9/11. Though the video has been online for months at this point, and completely ignored. [Terry Jones, publicly known for inciting violence is brought in at this point:](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h0mrl3Q2GBDz-IB8AR9YyByWKqPw?docId=80b06a6ab90443feb4d91aefb6674cc6)
&gt;Pastor Terry Jones of Gainesville, Fla., who burned Qurans on the ninth anniversary of 9/11, said he spoke with the movie's director on the phone Wednesday and prayed for him. He said he has not met the filmmaker in person, but the man contacted him a few weeks ago about promoting the movie. ""I have not met him. Sam Bacile, that is not his real name,"" Jones said. ""I just talked to him on the phone.


* Reports from eyewitnesses and officials come in from Libya that the deadly attack on the US embassy appears to have been pre-planned. It's said that the attackers appeared extremely professional level and that the protest outside appeared relatively peaceful and largely used as [a diversion until the actual attack began.](http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-us-ambassador-killed/index.html?hpt=hp_t1)

&gt;Captain Fathi al-Obeidi, commander of a special Libyan operations unit, said his men and an eight-man U.S. force came under attack after American survivors had left the blazing consulate and moved to an ostensibly secret location in an isolated villa. The villa came under an intense and highly accurate mortar barrage.
“I really believe that this attack was planned,” he said. “The accuracy with which the mortars hit us was too good for any regular revolutionaries.”


* Some analysts are suggest the violence stemming from the video clip was far from spontaneous.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 5 PM EST:**
 
* [Wired has uncovered information that the listed shell company that managed the film was named ""Pharaoh Voice, Inc""](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/anti-islam-flick/all/) and run by someone named ""Youssef M Basseley"" likely another alias of Nakoula. 
&gt;L.A.-based actress Cindy Garcia, who played a role as the mother in the video, listed a “Sam Bassiel” as the film’s producer on her resume. Crew member Jimmy Israel was given the name “Abnob Nakoula Basseley” for registration with the Screen Actors Guild. A company behind the casting, called Pharaoh Voice, Inc., listed a “Youssef M. Basseley” as its president.  
[Corporate listing here.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Hawaiian-Gardens/pharaoh-voice-inc/44853277.aspx)

* Nakoula nows denies any involvement in the film's creation stating:
&gt;Nakoula told the Associated Press he managed a company that produced the video, but has since denied any involvement in the film. “I’m a gas station worker, I didn’t work on it, I know nothing about it. They need to blame someone,” Nakoula later told the Telegraph during an interview outside his Los Angeles home. But on Thursday, federal law enforcement officials said that Nakoula was in fact Bacile. 

* In July of 2011 — the month after he got out of jail — Nakoula started casting actors for “Innocence.”

* [WIRED article cites](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/anti-islam-flick/all/) several other aliases uncovered being used by Nakoula. Matthew Nekola; Ahmed Hamdy; Amal Nada; Daniel K. Caresman; Kritbag Difrat; Sobhi Bushra; Robert Bacily; Nicola Bacily; Thomas J. Tanas; Erwin Salameh; Mark Basseley Youssef; Yousseff M. Basseley; Malid Ahlawi; even P.J. Tobacco.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 6 PM EST**

* We now know somewhat of the process on how the video was spread in the key regions. [Both the U.S. promotion by Jones at the request of Bacile and the promoting within the middle east and Egypt specifically appeared to happen at the same time.](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/09/egyptian-outrage-peddler-who-sent-anti-islam-youtube-clip-viral/56826/)
&gt; The original trailer of Innocence of Muslims was posted to YouTube by Bacile in July, but **never gained attention until last week when it was translated into Arabic and linked to by an Egyptian-American Copt Morris Sadek in an Arabic-language blog post. Around that same time, Koran-burning Florida Pastor Terry Jones began promoting the film to practically no effect in the U.S.** But it did gain the attention of a Glenn Beck-style TV pundit in Egypt: Sheikh Khalad Abdalla, a host on the Islamist satellite-TV station al-Nas.* On Sept. 8, Abdullah lit the match that set this entire international incident in motion and broadcast an offensive clip of the trailer in which a man playing Muhammad calls a donkey ""the first Muslim animal."" 
[Here's the fateful moment of Abdullah on TV playing the clip.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnM_NuW0r9M&amp;feature=player_embedded)


* 3 days BEFORE the embassy attack and before the Bacile/Nousak interview with AP in which he claimed to be Coptic, the story that the video was created by ""Coptics"" was already circulating the middle east.
&gt; Shortly following Abdullah's broadcast, views of the video began increasing rapidly and Cairo news outlet Youm7.com reported that the leader of an Egyptian political party ""denounced the production of the film with the participation of vengeful Copts.""

* Bacile/Nakoula's YouTube account appears to have favorited a video from Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar:
&gt; Sam Bacile, didn’t do much with his YouTube account, besides uploading two clips from the “Innocence of Muslims” film, but he also commented in Arabic on an Egyptian video discussing his movie, and [last month he had favorited a video from the Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar attacking Ibrahim Issa and defending the Salafis](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DjVszAn4GAyzgsjtkJONg/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=15). A video defending Salafism is an odd choice for someone who claims to think Islam is a cancer to add to his favorites.

&gt;**Anti-Muslim Movie Maker a Meth Cooker: The man behind the incendiary film, Innocence of Muslims, has a criminal record that includes a narcotics conviction. According to a source close to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula was arrested by the L.A. Country Sheriff's Department on March 27, 1997 and charged with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.** He pleaded guilty and was sentenced on Nov. 3, 1997 to one year in county jail and three years probation. The D.A.’s office said he violated probation on April 8, 2002, and was re-sentenced to another year in county jail.  Nakoula had been registered to vote as a Democrat from 2002-2008, according to the L.A. County Registrar Recorder’s office. In April of 2008, he changed his political affiliation to American Independent.

* Los Angeles law enforcement officials [had already been monitoring Nakoula, including during the event claimed to have been the film's sparsely attended ""premiere"" in Hollywood.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/13/mohammed-movie-s-mystery-director.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=cheatsheet_afternoon&amp;cid=newsletter%3Bemail%3Bcheatsheet_afternoon&amp;utm_term=Cheat%20Sheet)
&gt; The director didn’t watch his creation the night of the premiere. Instead, he sat by himself at a nearby restaurant, staring intensely at the theater, the law enforcement source told The Daily Beast. What he didn’t know was that he was being watched by officers. **“You are monitoring the people in the area for behavioral characteristics, and he was displaying them. Normal people don’t act like that. He was across the street, on the opposite side of the block, so he could view what was going on. He was sweating and focusing in on the entrance. He was watching what was going on around and who was going in,”** the source said.


I believe there's very strong evidence here that a low cost, high concept plan was at work to manufacture this video.

The vote failed 205-217. Only 12 votes short of a ""Yes"" vote majority...thats 12 votes out of 422 voting representatives. And according to reports, the whitehouse made a huge lobbying effort against the amendment a few hours before it went to a vote. 

All this week, the top-upvoted comments on every post that I read (about the amendment) were comments about what a joke this all was &amp; how it would never happen - Well, yesterday was the first congressional vote over domestic spying since secret NSA programs were recently made public, and it was a damn close vote. I'm sure many of the ""Yes"" votes were cast because it was the right thing to do, but I'm also sure many ""yes"" votes were cast out of representative's fear of their constituent's outrage.

Most of the representatives that voted ""No"" on the amendment today will be getting flooded with angry emails &amp; phone calls about it for weeks and they'll get an idea of how many votes they'll lose in their next election if they stay on the wrong side of this issue.

So if you're on Reddit &amp; you feel the urge to post a comment about how nothing can/will change when it comes to government surveillance - ***Don't*** - and instead spend that time on an email to your elected representative about today's vote on defunding NSA programs instead.

* Christopher Dorner, the ex-LAPD officer now on-the-run murder suspect, claims to having been fired for crossing the “blue line.” The blue line is the unofficial code of conduct amongst all officers to protect their brothers and sisters in the force, even if that means being silent in the presence of illegal activity. Chris Dorner’s manifesto, as people are calling it, contains allegations of a culture within the LAPD of perjury, crime, and falsities. Dorner was battling depression for multiple years prior to his killing spree against LAPD officers and their family. In a story that contains hot societal questions about high power guns, mental health, police conduct, corruption, and football related concussions, it is built for national news.

  
  


*Societal Reaction*:

* The divisive circumstance surrounding Dorner’s actions and words is readily apparent. Christopher Dorner is stirring strong emotions in people due to his perception as an intelligent, kind individual with a strong moral compass, but one who has now committed heinous acts of violence. The manifesto’s has spurred people to voice their discontent with police ethics of conduct. People hailing Dorner’s actions have upset many as well. 



*Analysis &amp; Discussion*:

* The crux of the issue is not being focused on. What people should be focusing on in the Christopher Dorner saga is not the how but the why. Why are so many people in support of the message that police conduct needs to change? Dorner is not some extreme outlier in our population. He is not dissimilar from many individuals who learn about him in the media. The truth is this: we live in a dysfunctional society, one which inevitably creates dysfunctional people. Dorner is the product of an environment that doesn’t value justice or equality. Everyday Joes are finding themselves relating to a man who is hunting the LAPD, has killed one officer who was on the board that fired him, and attacked another. 


* The individuals who are upset about those who support the ex-officers’ actions or his words should be more upset about the fact that an environment is present that even allows so many to relate to this individual. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter whether Christopher Dorner is viewed as a good person or not, the conversation about police conduct is being brought to a conscious level. This is only a single event in a larger trend, however.

* The distrust and discontent of the United States government by its citizens is only growing and is seeping into public life. The fact that so many sympathize with an at-large murder suspect reflects the notion clearly. Societal tension is progressively getting worse in response to a government that allows certain individuals to live by a very different set of laws than everyone else. It is important in stories like Christopher Dorner’s, that caption the attention of many, to put everything in the context of society as a whole.

**Bradley Manning**

Note: Apply ""allegedly"" to all of this. So if he actually did what everyone thinks he did.

Yes, I know, everyone is very happy about the whistle-blowing he did. But the guy did release tens of thousands of documents, including documents that had nothing related to whistle-blowing. Documents that included things like our diplomats bitching about other diplomats and world leaders, something that's not likely to help us build diplomatic ties now that they're out in the open.

More importantly, Manning released the [Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Foreign_Dependencies_Initiative), a list of all the places America is vulnerable to terrorist attack. Now available for anyone to see, including every last person on the Earth who'd want to do harm to America.

Even if you agree with Manning releasing all that other stuff, that doesn't excuse him from releasing stuff like this. Stuff that has no value as ""whistle-blowing"", but *can* be used by our enemies to hurt us.

And for everyone who says, ""well, it's not treason"", I've got news for you, because under our laws, it *is*. Amongst the charges levied against Manning is a charge under the Espionage Act. [One part in particular](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793) is damning:

&gt;**Whoever, lawfully having** possession of, **access to**, control over, or being entrusted with **any document**, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note **relating to the national defense**, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, **willfully communicates**, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same **to any person not entitled to receive it**, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;

This, Manning did without question if he truly did leak these documents.

But ""treason""? ""Treason"" is a strong word... What's the US Constitution have to say about that?

&gt; Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, **giving them Aid and Comfort**. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.

Ah, yes. Well, I imagine revealing a list of prime targets qualifies as giving them aid and comfort.

If he leaked these documents, by our laws, Bradley Manning absolutely *did* commit treason.

For those concerned about the ""Right to a speedy trial"" thing, you might be interested to read [this](http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2011/01/motion-to-dismiss-for-lack-of-speedy.html). It's a post made by David E. Coombs, Manning's lawyer, detailing RCM 707 and UCMJ Article 10, which deal with the right to a speedy trial and ""reasonable exclusions"". The long and short of it is, there are some cases when a court can grant extensions, *especially* when it's a trial of a military officer and *especially* especially when it's dealing with state secrets. And while there's certainly an argument to be made that the US government has abused its ability to request extensions, that's not yours, mine, Manning's, or even the prosecution's decision to make - it's the court's.

Also, regarding Manning's detainment, at least a part of the poor conditions he's been detained in are to some extent his own damn fault. He made a joke about committing suicide to one of his guards. Well, that's about as smart as making a joke to a TSA agent about a bomb, isn't it? [Here](http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2011/03/truth-behind-quantico-brigs-decision-to.html) is Coombs' post regarding the subject.

Now, the reaction to this comment was extreme, no doubt. It allegedly didn't follow regulations, and Coombs was right to complain, and most likely also right that this *was* mistreatment of Manning... but to call it abuse is stretching things, I think. They have an extremely high-profile prisoner. Imagine how it would look if the guy joked about hanging himself with his underwear, his guards did nothing, and then the next morning he was found dead, hanged by his underwear. Now imagine the pile of shit that the guard who didn't respond to the comment would be in. According to various posts by Coombs, apparently the folks at Quantico were very apprehensive that something might happen to Manning while he was in their care. So apparently, they went overboard in their desire to make sure he was safe. This doesn't excuse it, of course, but those who seem to feel like he's being intentionally subjected to torture are maybe being a bit hasty in their judgment.

Incidentally, after he got transferred from Quantico to Fort Leavenworth, [here is a description of his typical day](http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2011/05/typical-day-for-pfc-bradley-manning-at.html).

.

**Guantanamo**

First off, yeah, Guantanamo sucks and human rights violations suck. I'm totally with you there. For any on the *other* side of the political divide who've seen how expensive it is and think it's some sort of country club, I have news for you - it is on an island in the middle of semi-hostile waters. Everything needs to be shipped there, and because of this, *everything* is expensive there.

However, the big thing I often see here is how Obama hasn't closed Guantanamo. What a liar, right?

Well, except almost immediately after taking office, he signed an [executive order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ClosureOfGuantanamoDetentionFacilities/) directing it to be closed.

Well, then why's it still open? Ugh, because shit, that's why.

When his people got to Guantanamo, what they discovered was that [the paperwork was a terrible mess](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/24/AR2009012401702_pf.html). Of course we now know that many detainees didn't even have paperwork. Anyway, Obama directed his people to get the paperwork in order so we could start actually prosecuting these people. You know, according to the law. And it was around that time that Republicans started making a stink about how terrorists shouldn't be tried in courts or housed in prisons on American soil, ""not in my backyard"" bullshit... and then Democrats lost the supermajority and Republicans have been using the filibuster like a blunt weapon ever since.

In 2010, Obama had to sign the military budget, like the President does every year. This bill includes the funds for everything the military does. Our wars overseas, all of our military installations, all the paychecks our soldiers get. It's a bill that *has* to get passed, especially during wartime. You can see it [**here**](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ383/html/PLAW-111publ383.htm). Republicans would not let it get by Congress without section 1034, which forbids the President from using any funds to move detainees from Guantanamo. In fact, they made it a part of their party platform's 2010 Congressional campaign promise list that they wouldn't let Guantanamo detainees be moved.

Obama, knowing how important the bill was, signed it, hoping he could work out a deal with Congress to do something about that section... because he kinda' needed the hundreds of other pages in that bill to get passed. 2012's military budget had the same section, and he once again signed the bill, knowing we couldn't just not have a military budget.

You might argue, he could have threatened not to sign it, I suppose. Republicans are, after all, very protective of their defense spending, and Democrats generally not so much. But Republicans would have continued to stonewall, and I'll bet you anything that the line they'd use would be ""Obama cares more about terrorists than he cares about our troops!"", and given the way the public sees things, his poll numbers would shoot down the tubes. Which, in itself, isn't horrible if it *accomplishes* something, but the Republicans would have milked it for every penny, all while refusing to give an inch. For them, it'd be two birds with one stone - prove to your voters that you're keeping your promise of not closing Guantanamo, and make Obama look like a terrorist-coddling, troop-hating Liberal.

That's the way things will continue to be, until either Republicans stop filibustering everything they don't like, or Democrats regain a supermajority in the Senate.

**""Insurance rates are rising since Obamacare went into effect!""**

I have spent a [considerable](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx) amount of time reading through this bill, and I [continue](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vrt9x/obamacare_pointbypoint/) to do so. I'll try not to be redundant by repeating the content of those here, but there is one bit of recent information I've come across, and it puts a damper on the claims that insurance premiums will rise because of the bill.

First off, last year, they *did* rise, and quite a bit. Something like 9%. Which seems like a lot, until you [look at the last decade](http://facts.kff.org/upload/jpg/enlarge/3%20Percentage%20Increase%20in%20Health%20Insurance%20Premiums%20Compared%20to%20Inflation1.jpg). For half of that decade, prices shot up just as much, if not more.

But that's not good news... that just means that nothing changed in 2011. But something *did* change in 2012. In 2012, our premiums only went up [4%](http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/11/pf/insurance/health-insurance-premiums/index.html), which is a *huge* accomplishment. Now, it's far too early to say if this is a trend, and given that most of the big changes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act puts into place don't happen until 2014, it's hard to say just what will happen to premiums then... but for now, the rise in insurance premiums is actually *slowing*.

.

So... yeah. just wanted to put that out there.

After a positive response to [my previous effort post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/19s5fm/hugo_chavez_busting_some_neocon_myths/), I've written another. 


Reading the newspapers, we see that Hugo Chavez was an authoritarian demagogue. A [“would-be dictator”](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/opinion/hugo-chavez-departs.html), no less. Why then, did he and his party win 15 of 16 elections in just 14 years? In other words, why was he so popular?


Unlike most people who talk about Venezuela, I don't want you to just believe me, I want you to check up on me, to scrutinize my figures to within an inch of their life. That's why I've given you links to everything. Every effort has been made to use unimpeachable, international sources such as the World Bank, United Nations and respected polling organizations such as Pew Global and Latinobarometro, who are used frequently in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and the Economist. This is to make sure there can be no questioning of the data. Note* this is an analysis of successes, not failures. If I get a good response I'll consider doing analysing failures, of which there are some, although many supposed failures have been [debunked already](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/19s5fm/hugo_chavez_busting_some_neocon_myths/).

**Venezuela Before Chavez**

Despite producing more than $300 billion of oil wealth between 1958-1998, the equivalent of 20 Marshall Plans, the majority of venezuelans were living in shocking slums. By the 1990s, quality of life indicators for ordinary Caracas residents were slightly below Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. Between 1970-1997, workers' incomes declined by 50%, while poverty doubled between 1984-1991.
There was widespread repression, with the previous 3 presidents all using censors and all suspending constitutional guarantees. The two main political parties, almost indistinguishable in ideologies shared the oil wealth between them, blocking out any third parties. Just in case, they rigged elections anyway, as [89% of Venezuelans believe.](http://i.imgur.com/CubSa3w.jpg) The LA Times' Bart Jones commented that the guy who came 4th in the 1993 election may have got the most votes. (Jones, B. Hugo!, p. 184.) Inflation reached [103%](http://i.imgur.com/uSq7BFY.jpg) and there was considerable repression, like the infamous [Caracazo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracazo) where Jones describes “mass graves” filled with “mutilated corpses” of all ages. “Tied up corpses” with “bullets in the back of the head” and Red Cross workers gunned down in the street (Jones, Hugo, p.124). 




**Poverty**

This is the big one. It is often mentioned in passing in the press, but never explored. Let's do so. According to the World Bank, [poverty has halved in 10 years](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC/countries/VE-BR?display=graph) while [extreme poverty has dropped by nearly 3/4](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY/countries/VE-BR?display=graph). Here they are juxtaposed with Brazil, a country lauded for its achievements in reducing poverty. Given Venezuela's population, that equates to around 10 million people (1/3 of the entire population) pulled out of poverty. Both the [United Nations Development Project](http://i.imgur.com/cdaFIOv.jpg) and the [World Bank](http://i.imgur.com/eKaova1.jpg) agree that unemployment dropped from over 11% to under 8%.
Child malnutrition has [dropped by 2/3.](http://i.imgur.com/OeoP3DQ.jpg) Fully 1.2 million children were malnourished when Chavez came to power) Venezuela's [GDP per capita](http://i.imgur.com/w6nZxIy.jpg) has skyrocketed, as has [GNI per capita.](http://i.imgur.com/ShvUryJ.jpg) However, these measures only take into account financial improvements. It is to non-financial improvements we now turn.


**Health**

Chavez has accomplished the herculean task of creating a universal healthcare system from out of the ground. Health expenditures per person [have tripled.](http://i.imgur.com/Wn2MDia.jpg) As a result, child mortality has [dropped precipitously](http://i.imgur.com/aSSxUNd.jpg). The number of public doctors rose 1,100%, from just 1628 for the entire nation in 1998 to 19,571 in 2007. These doctors had given 225 million free consultations by 2007(Source Cannon, B. Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution, p. 93). 51,000 forgotten Venezuelans were given operations to restore their sight. 

**Democracy**

Voter turnout in the 2012 elections was over [80%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012), higher than any US election in history. Under Chavez, nearly two and a half times as many people vote as in the 1990s. (1998 turnout: [6.3mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1998), 2012 turnout [14.8mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012)) 
 Jimmy Carter and the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Carter Center recently stated [“the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.”](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=8935#.USvSHnMnty4) The European Union Election Observation Mission agreed, saying [“the system developed in Venezuela is probably the most advanced in the world to date”](http://embavenez-uk.org/pdf/fs_democracia.pdf). Canadian NGO, the foundation for Democratic Change gave the Venezuelan election [78/100(very satisfactory)](http://democracychange.org/2012/10/2012-fda-global-electoral-fairness-report-on-venezuela/). It gave the 2012 US election [54.5/100(unsatisfactory)](http://democracychange.org/2012/10/2012-fda-electoral-fairness-report-on-the-united-states/) One year pre-Chavez, only [11% of Venezuelans claimed elections were clean.](http://i.imgur.com/1JOmBJZ.jpg) By 2006, [2/3 believed they were.](http://i.imgur.com/BdT8eFj.jpg) Venezuela has by far the largest number of political parties in Latin America, and their confidence in them is the [highest in the region](http://i.imgur.com/c7B0Me0.jpg). This is in contrast to a 1990 poll which found only 4% approval of parties. (Source: Buxton, J. Case Studies in Latin American Political Economy, p. 177) In 2002, [80% of Venezuelans believed “my vote influences policy”](http://i.imgur.com/6uRqNRB.jpg). Venezuelans were asked to rate their democracy, on a scale of 1-10, [by far the most popular answer was 10.](http://i.imgur.com/an0pd2n.jpg) Venezuelans believe there is [slightly more freedom of speech in VZ than in Spain.](http://i.imgur.com/hD8PQxY.jpg)

**Women's Rights**

Venezuela was an uber- machismo society (think “Mad Men”).  The new [Constitution](http://venezuelanalysis.com/constitution) was written with gender neutral words. Housewives' work is officially recognised as work and housewives get paid by the government to work. The women's bank was set up to provide loans to women. There has been a 500% increase in the amount of female representatives in parliament. It is a loong way from a feminist's dream. But it has considerably improved.


**Economy**

Venezuela's economy has more than [tripled in size since Chavez took office.](http://imgur.com/X6DaqGO) In Foreign Affairs, the flagship US political science journal, Bernardo Alvarez shows that DataAnalysis published a report which found a [445% income increase among the poorer classes of Venezuela and a 194% increase for the upper classes](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64459/bernardo-alvarez-herrera-and-francisco-rodr%C3%83%C2%ADguez/revolutionary-road) due to the huge economic boom driven by the state. Venezuela's stock market is [the highest-performing](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/stock-market) in [the world.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/31/venezuela-best-stock-market-2012) Venezuelans are the [most optimistic about their economy in Latin America.](http://i.imgur.com/HPVlVlu.jpg) Contrary to what you might have heard, Venezuelan inflation has [plummeted since Chavez took office-](http://i.imgur.com/XZKvxxP.jpg) down from 103% one year pre-Chavez to just 18.6% this year. This despite a large increase in spending power. How are they doing this? They must be racking up huge debts, right? [Wrong again.](http://i.imgur.com/dohx0dT.jpg)


**Education** 

Thanks to [Mission Robinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Robinson) more than 1.5 million forgotten Venezuelans have learned to read and write for the first time. ([Jones, B. Hugo!, p. 8](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ek1R2g29xeIC&amp;pg=PT12&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false))
Despite its small population, Venezuela has the 5th largest student body in the world, having tripled to 2 million in 2010 (7% of population) ([S Brouwer, Revolutionary Doctors, p. 147](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DjjW_XAkE4AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=revolutionary+doctors&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QYs7UdKOBo7Y7AbVxYGIBQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=university%20enrollment&amp;f=false)) University education is free in public universities. Nearly half a million street children are now in school and [dropout rates are very low.](http://i.imgur.com/KVJ335h.jpg)


**Equality**

According to the GINI index, in 1998, Venezuela was the most unequal country in the most unequal region in the world. In contrast to the USA, inequality has [dropped from 0.49 to 0.39](http://venezuela-us.org/tablas/gini_e.html). [(Numbers confirmed by this BBC article)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19813533) to become the lowest in Latin America. 

**Integration**

Venezuela has taken the lead in integrating Latin America. Organizations like [CELAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Latin_American_and_Caribbean_States), [Unasur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unasur) and [ALBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_Alliance_for_the_Americas) have been formed to help integrate Latin American nations. Venezuela is, by a considerable margin, [the most admired country in Latin America.](http://i.imgur.com/yZFMfwH.png). In 1996, it was only [the 6th](http://i.imgur.com/OH2qWcd.jpg).

Most of these [highly](https://www.google.ca/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:VEN&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=gdp%20venezuela#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=eg_use_elec_kh_pc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:VEN:COL&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=889142400000&amp;tend=1267833600000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) accessible [facts](http://www.latinobarometro.org/latino/LATAnalizeSample.jsp) are [easily available online](http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/11/05/section-2-national-conditions-and-the-global-economy/), in [English](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/).

It took a while, but now Cuba finally allows its citizens to (mostly) travel freely about the world. This comes as part of a package of reforms introduced by Raul Castro, including right to ownership of property such as houses and farms, licensing of small private businesses, etc. 

If we want to accelerate Cuba's standard of living (it is already [pretty high](https://www.google.ca/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:CUB&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=cuba%20life%20expectancy) for comparable countries) or at least help liberalize their society somewhat, we have to open the door to trade with this island nation. 

It makes the USA seem like an elephant that's scared of a mouse, to be afraid of trading with Cuba today. Nobody's perfect, especially not national leaders, so why the hell do we still cling to this senseless embargo on Cuba while Fidel Castro happily smokes cigars into his 80s? Having outlived Reagan, JFK, Nixon and LBJ, how long are we going to wait? 

It's time to change. El bloqueo is no longer working. The Cubans have managed to make a society that has a life expectancy of Canada with only using 10% of the resources. This is all *in spite* of the US blockade, barring them from the biggest market in the world.

Where were the killing lines?  He mentioned Romney's lack of specific positions, but glossed them into random paragraphs on other topics.  He should have brought these out and hammered Romney with them.  What about Romney's time at Bain?  I can't believe that he didn't smack Romney down on jobs creation.

These are just random examples.  If we regard 'winning' the debate as 'most improving one's position in the campaign,' I'm picking Romney as the winner, simply because Obama didn't do a damn thing.

FFS, I was planning on using today's debate for class tomorrow.  Now I need to make a new lesson, because this is practically worthless.

EDIT: A number of people have rightly pointed out that a lesson can be made on how not to be boring, how not to miss opportunities, and just how not to debate in general.  This is fair enough, but good lessons are productive and engaging, and I know from experience that ""don't-do-this"" type lessons are just not as interesting and productive as ""do it like this"" type lessons.  We'll be talking about the debate in class for sure, but let's just say it didn't provide me with the material I'd hoped it would.

**Edit 2**: It's really funny how many people are still messaging me about how my political bias is somehow cheating my students.  You people should really learn that you can't make sweeping judgments about people based on very little knowledge.  The last Democrat whom I voted for president was Clinton.  President Clinton - not Secretary.  I am hardly a Democrat mouthpiece, and in my private life (i.e., not in class), I've been very critical of Obama's performance in office.  By my (too-high) standards, he has not been a good president.

I appreciate that so many of you know how to teach my class better than do I.  This is exactly what's wrong with America's educational system: all the best teachers just sit at home and complain about the paid teachers!  End sarcasm.

Driving a vehicle while intoxicated is a crime because you are much more likely to injure someone. 

Should handling a firearm while intoxicated also be a crime for the same reason?

I think the biggest issue in America today is that most Americans have no idea who most of their candidates are in every election they are capable of voting in.

Thanks to the internet there are logical steps we can take to begin to resolve this problem, but what frustrates me is I cannot find any influential political figures or journalists explaining to people what we need to know.

Step 1: voters must have the ability to learn about, share their opinion on, and contact **all** of our candidates and elected representatives through one convenient web directory. 

Problem: today voters need to first track down their sample ballot (which does not include write-in candidates, which is a problem from the start) and then manually type every candidate's name into a search engine in order to learn anything about them. The information we need is scattered all across the internet. This is an unnecessarily tedious process that most Americans realistically will never do. So on voting day most of us feel overwhelmed, become cynical and apathetic, and end up not voting, casting poorly informed votes, or blindly voting along party lines.

Do you think that when researching our candidates becomes dramatically easier, when we can learn about and contact them through one convenient web page, that it should improve our collective hiring (electing) decisions?

Another problem: [this graphic](http://i.imgur.com/aWB2UL2.png). *Even with* a government monitoring tool like EveryVote, monitoring the performance of my 50+ elected representatives (and that graphic doesn't include my 30+ judges) would be very difficult. That makes me think that today, still living in an age without comprehensive tools, that adequately monitoring our officials is completely impossible for average voters.

What do you think about the plans in these UI diagrams? Would you use a website like this? Do you have ideas for improvement? Thoughts or concerns?

""I think that in the US today, most people don't have much of an idea about what the President actually does, what it means, and why he does it. A concept that I have always loved was FDR's Fireside Chats. I feel like these chats really reached out to the people and helped explain the basics about important issues at the time.

Every President since then has held a weekly address (http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/weekly-address), but I feel that the current addresses focus only one one small issue every week. Many times, this issue has no immediate or direct connection to the political issues of today, and often carries a political message.

I feel that the President should hold a daily or at least weekly address which informs the people exactly what he did that day/week. It could be a few minutes long, just briefly listing his actions during that day/week (obivously, classified stuff would not be shared). Discussion of the facts and reasoning behind those actions could be put into a textual post along with the video. This would allow the video itself to be short and, since the president is probably very busy, could be written by someone other than the president but following his views.

I think the President's address to the people should be informative, not just a political statement here, and a ceremonial head nod there. With so many people criticizing and praising what Presidents do, it would be nice if the President himself would take some time and share the details with his people.

What do you think?

To be clear, I don't believe that it is impossible to find out what the President is doing, I just think that if it was presented in a more personal, detail, organized way using lay terms, this information might actually disseminate.""

**TL;DR: Should the President make a daily/weekly video about exactly what he did that day/week and the facts related to it? Video could be accompanied by text elaborating the topics, written by aids.**

**Edit: Feel free to comment/suggest/criticize. Any suggestions on the form this podcast should take? How long/frequent should it be? Should it replace or supplement the current Weekly Address?**

**Edit2: Many people have been saying that there already exists more than enough information sources for what I described. I agree. However, I do not think that they are reaching people in an effective way. Some people have said that what I am proposing is a way to be informed without any effort. This is exactly what I am proposing. No, I don't think it's ideal to make something which assumes the user is lazy, and at best, slightly interested. But that is how the world is. Most people don't know, don't care, and don't have the time/patience to actually research this stuff on their own. Yet they are still expected to act on this knowledge when voting. The problem is and has always been the ignorant masses. This is aimed at reaching them in a practical way. You can not expect the average american to look this stuff up if it takes more than one click/search entry/video. It's a sad truth, but it is still a truth.

1352587830.0,154,self.PoliticalDiscussion,12zepz,We spend nearly 40% of the US federal budget on senior citizens' benefits. Can we at least acknowledge that this group has the most entitlements of any in our country? Far more of our tax dollars go to support our elderly than support deadbeats on welfare. ,198,44,353,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/12zepz/we_spend_nearly_40_of_the_us_federal_budget_on/,"I've been looking at data from several sources, including [the 2010 US federal budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fy2010_spending_by_category.jpg).  Of the five programs with a budget of more than $200 billion, three of them (Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) are used primarily by senior citizens.  The other two are defense spending, and ""income security"", a catchall that includes pensions, unemployment, and welfare.  Looking at it this way, it seems impossible to cut spending significantly without telling our grandparents to head out to the ice floes like Eskimos used to do.  Can we at least admit that this is where we need to be focusing if we're serious about entitlement reform?  And if we want to make sure that our elderly are well-cared for, can we at least admit that we'll have to pay for it?

There is the common argument that retirees have paid into Social Security and Medicare for their entire lives, and thus deserve its benefits, but that's not actually accurate for Medicare.  [See this article, for example.](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/256212/medicare-and-social-security-what-you-pay-vs-what-you-will-get-maybe-veronique-de-rugy#)  [Or this one.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/02/AR2011010203213.html)  It turns out, the average senior citizen receives about three times as much in benefits as they paid in.  Also, not all senior citizens paid into the system.  Disabled people and stay-at-home mothers receive Social Security and Medicare, despite not paying into the system.  I'm not saying they *shouldn't*, but they *are*, and someone needs to pay for their benefits.  Right now, nobody is, and they're just going on the deficit.

To anyone who wants to better understand healthcare in the US and the Affordable Care Act, please, please [watch this video.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/obamasdeal/view/?autoplay)  I follow politics *very* closely, and I can't believe how much I learned from watching this.

edit: People have been asking what *I* think should be done.  First, Social Security is easy to fix, and just needs to have the FICA income cap raised.  Medicare is more of a problem.  Personally, I think health insurance needs to be expanded to include everyone.  Ideally, we should implement a public option that provides modest benefits while still being a strong safety net.  It should be as affordable as possible.  People on this plan would need to pay 10% of the cost to the insurance provider, so they're not completely divorced from the cost of their health services.  A $600 ambulance ride would cost $60, for example.  Checkups and preventative care would be exempt, to encourage its use.  Certain catastrophic care could have an even lower co-pay, like maybe 1%.  Over time, this plan would be expanded to cover everyone.  Private insurance would still exist, as supplemental insurance.  If you or your employer want to pay more for your health insurance so that you can see doctors in more expensive practices, great.  You'd be free to do that.  Still, I think no solution is complete that doesn't involve raising taxes to pay for the increasing costs.  The Bush tax cuts should be repealed in their entirety, and we should go back to the tax rates of the nineties.

My family was exceptionally conservative, and quite vocal about it even though the majority of my state was liberal. My father worked his ass off to provide for me. My grandmother and uncle were my daycare providers, we had a small but tight knit family who looked out for one another, more correctly, they looked out for me. Growing up I remember listening to Rush Limbaugh with my father, soaking up every word that ""Maha Rushie"" said, taking it as gospel. My father preached his conservative beliefs and I eventually took them as my own. 
  
  Throughout high school I was heavy into politics, I took AP classes on the subjects, debate team, etc. and I was a staunch Republican. I condemned Bill Clinton, while praising G.W. with my next breath, much to the chagrin of my teacher, but it did make for lively debates. I believed in the trickle down economic theory, as much as a clueless high school kid could. I despised those who were on federal and state assistance, I looked at them as lazy leeches who just weren't trying hard enough to get farther in life. I was taught that it was their fault, I was programmed to believe they were responsible for the situation that they happened to be in. I was insulated from the world and the trials and tribulations of the working poor. I was a lower middle class white kid who didn't know any better. 
  
  In college, I stayed a Republican, even though I went to a predominantly, if not entirely liberal school.  I majored in political science so I was in the war zone so to speak of the liberal educators. It felt like it was them versus me, which in reality, it was. Eventually I got tired of school around my junior year, so I did what any good little Republican would do and joined the military. Right? It would seem as though if you were a real Republican you would have joined, or at least not fled the country to avoid serving...
 
  Now, as a soldier, conservatism was rampant. But this was not the kind of conservatism I was used to. It was filled with hatred, bigotry, and a general disdain for the 'other' people in our country. I went to Iraq from 2008-2009, and there was a great deal of shouting about this and that, but none of it was remotely coherent. Now I am not saying that our military is filled with a bunch of ignorant folk, it just happened to be I was stationed with the majority of them, but there were some shining examples of intelligence amongst them and I am still friends with them to this day. Now I had a fair understanding of politics and government workings, I'm not saying I am going to be the next president, but I was at least educated in the matter. At this point in time I realized, wow, is this what this party has devolved to? Just ranting and raving about nothing and making things up as they go along. Noone really had any coherent argument or any facts to back up anything they were saying, there was a lot of talking, so I wish they did. It would have made for better conversation. But instead it was just constant blathering about how Obama will ruin the country or other various Fox ""news"" talking points, I'm sure a few of you know people like this. But this is what started my metamorphosis, my eyes were beginning to open. Damn was it bright out. 
  
  I was growing tired of the tirades of hate, that year my heart grew seven sizes. I began to see the struggle of people just trying to survive, not that of my own countrymen, but that of the Iraqi's. I didn't see them all as terrorists as many around me had, I saw them as hard working people trying to make a life in a war torn country. And yes, to clear up something, I was in the infantry, 11B hooah. I saw what the lack of a social safety net can do, a government that cannot take proper care of it's most vulnerable, the weakest members, is no government at all. This was my reawakening, thousands of miles away from my home and the plight of my own countrymen, and it felt terrible. 
  
  When I finally got back home, I found that my country wasn't doing so well, it wasn't like I didn't know that but it is something completely different to read about it than to actually experience it firsthand. I was honorably discharged in 2010 and went straight back to Massachusetts. It was here where I finally experienced the turmoil that was going on at home. I was unable to find work for the better part of a year, neither could my wife. It was a tough situation we had found ourselves in. Thankfully, I was able to rely on welfare, yep, that same welfare that the GOP are railing against today. It helped me stay afloat, helped to pay my rent, bills and put food on the table. Just enough to survive, but I was happy just surviving. We were barely scraping by but damn it I was going to keep trying. And we did, both of us. We continued to apply to jobs every day, 5-10 a day. We just could not find work, a veteran and my wife who has a bachelor's degree from a well known university. It felt like there was no way we could make it, and you know what, I don't blame the president for that. It may have been a tough economy, but I will not sit here and blame him, I may have not voted for him but I didn't feel it was directly his fault. Hell, if he could have fixed the economy that took eight years to shit the bed in one year and now within his first term, I think he would have been called a sorcerer or something of that sort. But apparently, my wife and I would be what some call, lazy moochers, sitting on our asses with our hands outstretched waiting for Uncle Sam to grease our palms for our almighty vote. Well, I wholeheartedly disagree with that statement, and I disagree with you Mr. Romney, economically and socially. That government assistance helped us survive, and helped us until I finally did get a job, as did my wife. But it took a year, and that's what the GOP fail to realize, finding a job takes time, and in that downtown how are we suppose to live if not for government assistance? How are we to feed our familes when we cannot find a job, or get laid off? Of course there are more people on food stamps and on welfare, have you seen the economy you idiots? The cost of goods has gone up, but pay has not, jobs have gone away, no shit people are relying on the government to help them survive. If it is not the job of the government to take care of it's citizens, then the government is just as bad as the mafia, taking and taking, but not giving back. 
  
  What Republicans seem to forget is that there are people out there who want to work, who want that opportunity to better themselves, no one is happy to barely survive off of the government benefits. They also seem to forget about the working poor, those folks who bust their asses day in and day out, sometimes with multiple jobs just trying to make ends meet, but still rely on foodstamps to help feed their families. These are the people you, the GOP are attacking, I am sorry but not all of us were born with a silver spoon in our mouths.
  
  At this point I am so disgusted with our political landscape. The need to fight for equal rights for a growing segment of our population. I thought that ended in 1965, but no there is a resurgence of ignorance and intolerance. I respect the right to speak your mind, but when it comes to policy, put the ignorance behind you and do what is best for your people. I am pretty sure we, as a free democratic country, a country that I fought for, should automatically give every single citizen of this country the same rights. How is it that corporations can be considered people and have rights while homosexuals still have to fight for theirs? What the hell is your issue America? Are you so blinded by your own theological reasoning and bible thumping that you cannot see what you are doing to this great country? You condemn Sharia Law, but yet you try to instill the extreme right, christian version of it in this country. How dare you force a segment of our population's moral and religious beliefs onto the entirety of this great nation. We are a melting pot of greatness, not carbon copies of one another. Where is my America? I am tired of the fear mongering, the hatefulness, the inequality. God damn it, this is not what I fought for!

Then the entire unedited video should be made available to the suspect either after an arrest or upon request. The video can be used as evidence in court either for or against either the officers in question or the suspect. Any time an officer uses a weapon or injures a suspect, an independent organization will review the video to determine what (if anything) should be done to reward or punish the officer.  

My vote would be for always on recording, but nothing other than interaction with suspects could ever be seen by anyone. No officer deserves to have their private conversations made public just because they are in uniform, and the law should completely protect them from irrelevant recordings being made available to anyone (even their supervisor). Additionally any conversations with informants must be edited to completely protect the informant.

Clapper committed a felony by perjuring himself while testifying under oath, and his reward is to get to head up an investigation into his own agency.

I'd like to clear a few things up in hopes that it will lead to better discourse and dialogue.

1. The term ""Assault Weapons,"" many people seem to mistake the technical term ""assault rifle"" with the political term ""assault weapon."" An assault rifle is a term describing a select fire rifle (meaning capable of full auto) that fires an intermediate cartridge (i.e. smaller than battle-rifle cartridges, lighter recoil, used for intermediate ranges). Assault weapons is a political term that various people define differently. The general consensus is that an ""assault weapon"" is a rifle that has certain features like vertical grips, detachable magazines or a flash suppressor. But because many hunting or sporting rifles have these features it generally turns into a ""i'll know it when i see it"" situation. People tend to use these terms interchangeably.

2. Magazines =/= clips, this is another term that is misused constantly. A clip is a device that stores and feeds ammunition into a magazine. There are many varieties from the m1 garand's en bloc clips to the stripper clips used in SKSs. A magazine holds ammunition and feeds the rounds into the chamber. I know this is confusing so for simplicity's sake 99% of the time magazine is the correct term.

3. Fully automatic guns and suppressor are illegal- This is not strictly true. Fully automatic guns, silencers, short barreled rifles, etc. are not illegal, they are highly regulated and expensive. If you would like to buy a suppressor for your weapon you merely need to save up a bit of cash, contact a legal dealer, do some paperwork and pay for the tax stamp. Edit: unless your state bans these items*

4. Guns must be registered, this is a general no. Some states do require handgun registration but there is no national firearms registration. If I buy a firearm then unless the state has a form of registration then there is no government form or info i have to send in to register that gun. Now sellers can, and likely will, keep a record of who bought the firearm but this is not done through the government.

I hope this was helpful. 

edit: so people are asking about the point of this thread in relation to political discussion. it is to help people speak more intelligently on a subject in their political discussions on gun control. terminology and understanding about what people are talking about it paramount to making a well reasoned point. If you are discussing firearms and do not understand the difference between the terms assault rifle and assault weapons then there is an important disconnect between you and the person using the term. It is important that people are on the same page when they use a phrase.",,False,,t5_2sfmf,1353535967.0,,,True,t3_13ku3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/13ku3x/so_about_guns/,

It seems that Snowden must have the upper hand in some ways considering he's most likely sitting on information (or is giving the appearance of having more information) which makes it very difficult for those who defend the NSA to respond since it could be quite easy to show they are lying if said information is revealed.

I come from the UK and we have a nuclear armed submarine patrolling the waters that's costing millions just to keep in operation. From my point of view we do not need it and getting rid of it, or even scaling it back, would certainly free up some cash. 

Now I could be wrong in thinking that no one suggests this, feel free to correct me and give examples of politicians who made cutting spending on the military part of their main agenda.

Please note I'm not trying to devalue any of the work that's being done by the military anywhere. That's a different debate. But I feel like a lot of the spending we're doing just isn't necessary.

Romney says it'll take him 8-10 years **just to balance the budget**. If Romney can't balance the budget in two terms, that means we have 8 more years of piling on to the national debt.

Big Media (particularly the film and music industry) and

I’d like to take a moment and set aside the longer-term dangers of creating a system that could be used for “turnkey tyranny”.  For now, I think it would be wise to follow the money. Let’s start with the current state of what I’m calling Big Media – industrialized music and movies.


In regard to the recent stories about making online piracy a felony, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/05/sopa-died-in-2012-but-obama-administration-wants-to-revive-part-of-it/ and the attempt to demonize ""hackers"" http://www.salon.com/2013/08/06/cyberscare_ex_nsa_chief_calls_transparency_groups_hackers_next_terrorists/singleton/  I feel like we’re beginning to see a larger picture. There is A HUGE amount of money lost from modern technology (film and music piracy). If Corporate interests and a bought-out Federal Government can collude to label all “hackers” (ie anyone who pirates anything) terrorists, then what would stop government organizations from going after everyone and charging people as felons? They wouldn't even need to go after everyone, once they start prosecuting people on a larger scale (which of course would be highly publicized by the also bought-out media) people would stop pirating drastically, putting the money right back where it “belongs”, which is back in the old business paradigms before the internet. That is to say, old money wants to maintain its status quo.


We as a people have nothing to gain from this, and much to lose.


Big media has a lot of money to lobby, http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000581 and I see this as a logical use of that money.

Why should we spend our lives attempting to ensure our own security against violent extremists when we are more likely to be killed in a car wreck?

If you combine the deaths from some of the [most widely-publicized incidents of extreme-violence in 2012](http://www.inquisitr.com/351330/a-history-of-violence-top-10-most-violent-acts-of-2012/), based on this article, you arrive at 45 people killed.  That's the same level of deaths attributed to lightning strikes in the United States, even considering that number dropped substantially in [2011 to a total of 26 killed, while 55 was the recent average](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/news/story/2012-01-09/lightning-deaths-storms-weather/52504754/1).

Considering that the concept of terrorism as a real and present danger to the American public was used to justify 2 foreign wars that have destabilized the entire cradle of human civilization, and led to the dissolution of civil liberties in the United States which millions have died to protect throughout our short history, a reasonable person might expect terrorism to create a death toll that is statistically proportionate to these historic, political extremes we now found ourselves in.

It does not.

My two cents: Affirmative Action should be based on socio-economic status. If you come come from a wealthy family and went to a good high school, you have an advantage in applying for college - regardless of your race. But if you come from a poor family and went to a bad public high school, then you are clearly disadvantaged - again, regardless of your race. If your family is poor, then you probably can't afford SAT/ACT prep courses, tutors, and the myriad of other resources available at a hefty price that allow rich students to succeed. If you come from a poor family, you may have also had to deal with a lot of other things that made focusing on schoolwork more difficult. 

The whole campaign for ""diversity"" is centered around the idea that different backgrounds and perspectives are healthy for a college environment. That's all fine and good. But I'd argue that a white kid who lives in poverty will have a more important perspective than a black kid who has rich parents and went to a private school. 

The policy I am proposing wouldn't marginalize minorities - it's true that blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be more socio-economically disadvantaged, and they too would benefit. In fact, I think framing AA in terms of socio-economic status would be a good way to get around the racial hangups that come with it. 

Mainly, I think we need to move beyond our conceptualization of diversity solely in terms of race. I think in modern America, there is more of a division in class than there is in race (how marxist of me!).

We've been all joking about the way ""/r/politics is leaking,"" and it's funny for a bit, as it usually comes up when someone tries to inflame our crowd by positing clearly biased materials, but its beginning to make actual discussion impossible. So lets make a few things clear:

1. Yeah, reddit is biased, but if you cannot argue without using that as a basis, then you dont belong here, you should go straight back to your thread of choice and enjoy the circle jerk.

2. Posts that pinpoint one candidate as folly-filled should not be tolerated, instead, if you must; rephrase the post as ""Why is it the case that X is perceived as _____"" 

3. Stop the god damned name calling. You may think X is a Liar, or Y is a socialist, but that's not discussion, it's beating a dead cow. If you find yourself doing this, please review the second part of point 1, and sod off.

4. Dont upvote any comment that refuses to rely on logic. It makes actual discussion  hard to come by, and it dissuades people from spending time to answer your questions.

5. Quit your bitching. Just stop it. Frankly, if you see someone calling anything ""evil,"" report it to the mods and downvote the shit out of it. This isnt discussion, it's complaining and rally crying.

6. The point of this thread is to get an idea of how people other then you think, **and** how they come about forming those arguments. if you already have an idea, dont seek for people to simply back it up with mob-esque cheers. I cannot tell you how often I have found this thread incredibly informational to pick up on arguments I've never considered. But with all of this republicans are billionaires and liars, and Democrats are socialist-baby killers nonsense, I find myself having to scroll through a lot of shit just to find a coherent thoughtful answer.

7. Finally, please remember one important thing: Real discussion is complicated, and will require holistic answers that will incorporate things that the /r/politics crowd instinctually will downvote because it dosent follow it's basis. Resist this urge. Indulging in it, even if you think it's ""evil,"" or whatever, ruins this thread.

  *  US can't have land warfare against Iran. Iran has population of 70 million and the country is mountainous as hell. More than twice the size of Iraq!

  *  Whole country would unite to fight the common enemy.

  *  After initial attacks Iranians can escalate the war, but US has no means to end it.

  *  Iran is technologically and culturally more advanced that Iraq. Aerial warfare was ineffective against Serbian military in Kosovo war and same would happen in Iran.



  *  Iran can constantly harass oil and gas shipments in the Gulf with asymmetrical warfare.

  *  Iran can sabotage oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain etc.

  *  Iran could create a major oil spill and set it on fire: it would block the Straight for weeks, even months. Also, mining the straight would be a good option. 


  *  US attack against Iran will turn Iraqi government against US. (Iran has Shiite majority and they are already starting to purge Sunnis from the government). Attacks against remaining US troops, contractors and embassies will either force US to get drawn to Iraq war again (this time fighting against majority of Iraqis with Iranian help) or leave the country and lose it to Iranian influence. Increase the Sunni refugee problem in surrounding Sunni countries by sending millions more over the borders.

In his dissenting opinion on ""Citizens United v.

Two years later, during the first election season since the 2010 decision, we are seeing the effects of allowing corporations to limitlessly contribute to super PACs. So was Justice Stevens correct in identifying limitless campaign contributions would lead to corruption? Or is this an extension of a democratic process?  A good Super PAC to use as an example would be [""Restore Our Future""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restore_Our_Future) which has raised (I think) around $100 million in support of Mitt Romney's campaign.

But how is that any different from the old system of living in a company town and buying from a company store at what ever rate the company wishes to offer?  That was ruled illegal a long time ago, but how did the health care system then come to mirror the past? 

Seems to me that the rapid increase in costs is leading far more businesses to opt out of health coverage whenever possible, even to the point of ensuring workers hours stay just under the requirements that would require them to offer coverage.  

Wouldn't a single payer system be both cheaper and in many ways a huge economic boon to every business now saddled with the high costs of offering coverage?  I can't imagine a bigger stimulus package for businesses then one that removes one of their single largest employee related expenses and removes them from the political minefield of what they will or will not cover.  It seems clear that the workers and businesses both would benefit immensely by not having their health coverage and employment tied together.  

Honestly now... what am I missing?

EDIT - Oh well, I tried.  The dogma of socialism vs capitalism wins out over reasoned discussion once again.  Meanwhile we continue to have a broken system with the highest expenses in the world, insurance that locks people to jobs for fear of losing it, and the highest medical bankruptcy rate in the world.  I still fail to see how maintaining any of this (as much of the GOP would apparently prefer) makes any sense at all for the long term health of our economy or citizens.

Also I found an [extensive list of studies](http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-system-cost) going back a couple decades that seems useful for discussion, and seems to come to a clear consensus that there would be significant long term advantages to a single payer system, not only from an individual but also a business perspective.

This was a Facebook post I made  as a follow up to an earlier thread. That thread asked my conservative leaning friends to weigh in on actions Obama could take in order to sway their vote. Here is what one of them said followed by my response:

""Obama SAYS plenty that makes you want to vote for him. The problem is that he has no real experience to help him be successful. The last four years proved that in my opinion. Actions speak louder than words, and he has not done anything to earn my vote. My legitimate question for liberals is what has he accomplished that gives you faith in him? It's not enough to just hate the conservative guy. What has Obama actually done in the last four years to deserve another term? In my opinion, Romney can just wipe the floor with Obama when it comes to successful business and governing. Let's get somebody in the oval office who knows what they're doing. If Romney had been able to win the last election, I think our country would be in a much better place today. But unfortunately 2008-2012 were a waste and I just don't think I can stomach four more years of the same. Hope is not a strategy.""

First, I have a very facts-based world view. I don't really take much on faith. I'm passionate about facts and the representation of those facts, but I don't care much for personal feelings about candidates. So, in that context, this is a largely facts-based response to that statement.

Obama has accomplished many significant things as president. It is a common view of conservatives that he is ""the worst president ever"" or maybe the second worst (after Carter). Here is a short list of accomplishments and who they benefitted. I have sources for all of these, but to try to leave this long post uncluttered I've omitted them. Let me know if you want specific sources for any of them and I'll post them.

1. Three new trade agreements (South Korea, Columbia, Panama) - South Korea represents the world's 15th largest economy, about 280,000 American jobs, and $12 billion in annual trade revenue. It's the largest expansion of trade in over a decade.
2. Restructuring the federal student loan program - This has added nearly $60 billion to federal student aid, much of it through the Pell Grant system. It cost the American tax payer nothing, and allows 4 million more high performing under privileged people to go to college (that's a 40% increase).
3. He effectively ended the Iraq war bringing home almost 100K US troops and ending a war that cost us $200 billion a year (by CBO estimates), more than 4,000 American lives, and the lives of over 100,000 Iraqis.
4. Under his direction, we were able to find and kill Osama Bin Laden, the perpetrator of one of the worst terrorist attacks ever to occur on American soil.
5. Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform was passed - a significant form of market regulation.
6. Love it or hate it, Obamacare is the single largest piece of healthcare legislation to pass in America ever. Healthcare reform is clearly a bi-partisan issue as we spend more as a percent of our GDP than any other industrialized nation, yet our care does not even rank in the top 25 in any major category.
7. Obama passed 5 major and 9 short-term tax cuts for small business and the middle class as a part of his economic recovery plan.

The list goes on and on. Saying he's a do-nothing president is propagandist. He has accomplished a lot as a president.

So, has he accomplished everything? Certainly not. There are plenty of things to be critical about. This includes his promises around a transparent administration, Guantanamo, NDAA, and many other promised reforms. I want to know what the end-game is for the war on terror. I want to know what he's going to do about drug policy. Also, his economic policies have not had their intended impact, but let's keep in mind a couple of key points for context there:

1. On the economy / jobs front, we watched between 2 and 3 trillion dollars of our economy disappear overnight. Nobody had the slightest idea how to handle the unprecedented shock of loosing 15% of our GDP that quickly. We faced a global financial crisis, and while everyone wants us to recover faster, we are recovering (as evidenced by home sales, unemployment, the stock market, and a variety of other factors).
2. The newly elected Tea Party congress decided to hold our credit rating hostage against what should have been a simple formality of raising the debt ceiling. We faced a government shutdown and the first ever down-grade of our credit because of obstructionism over a formality. This is the defining moment of my inability to side with Republican fiscal policy any longer. The newly elected congressmen held our nation hostage - it was an irresponsible and dangerous ploy.

So, do I hate Romney? No, not really. I think he'd be an ok president and that he genuinely wants us to do well. 

However, comments about his business acumen are suspect. Bain Capital was at best a firm that participated heavily in ""leveraged buyouts"" (where you borrow a lot of money to buy a cash-rich company and then push the debt onto the new legal entity once you own it. Most of these companies get dismantled shortly after.) and at worst a Gordon Gecko style ""vulture capital"" company. He didn't do anything illegal, but it's hardly a model of an exceptional businessman. Further, being good at starting rich and staying rich doesn't mean that your economic policies translate to the public sector. This is evidenced by his lack of specifics on any economic planning issues, and that a significant majority of economists support Obama's plans over Romney's. 

I registered as a Democrat earlier this week for the first time in 12 years. Largely because the Republican party's ideology has shifted on social issues past the point of no return. I can no longer justify being a ""fiscal conservative civil-libertarian"" with main-stream Republicans. First, I have no basis for believing in Republican fiscal conservatism. It's clear mathematically that tax cuts exclusive to the rich (like those proposed by Romney) hurt the middle class. Republican presidents have spent more than Democrats, and increased our debt more for the past 30 years. Further, I cannot see how a financial plan with a proposed $3 trillion in cuts and a $2 trillion (debatable) increase in costs will be financed by broadening the tax base and closing loopholes. It's like the party forgot how to do arithmetic, and it casts a deep shadow on Romney's capacity to understand complex economic issues. This is precisely why a solid majority of economists support Obama's plans over Romney's (Economists traditionally lean Republican).

Further, on social issues (and here is where things are much more opinion and much less fact) I'm appalled by the fact that access to birth control is a prevalent part of our political discourse. Further, I support rights for homosexuals, women's rights, and environmental policy. I also support more conservative policies like limited restrictions of fire arms. However, the Republican base has shifted so that ""if it ain't Christian, it ain't moral"" - which is a ludicrous stance to take. Romney's opinions on these social issues also continue to shift as the election progresses. All politicians flip-flop, but it is frustrating to see the extent to which Romney / Ryan will spin their statements to the electorate. It seems disingenuous.

Finally, for many people Obama represented an end to the status quo. Being young, generally progressive, and yes, even black, was inspiring to people. For many, it still is. We're watching a major shift from the boomer generation of political leadership to a new generation. If I have to pick one ideological sentiment for Obama, it is precisely that hope is a powerful message - especially when it's delivered by someone who represent the passing of one generation's ideology on to another.

Edits:

Ok, sources for my main points since I've been having to post them in the comments anyway:

Point #1: Trade agreements

* Great summary here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-gets-win-as-congress-passes-free-trade-agreements/2011/10/12/gIQAGHeFgL_story.html
* Size of SK economy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_South_Korea
* Actual page from the US Trade site about the deal: http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/korus-fta

Honestly, I didn't bother to look up Panama and Columbia as their agreements are only slightly economically relevant.

Point #2: Federal student loan program
 
* CNN fact checking article about the debates on this issue: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/17/politics/fact-check-student-aid/index.html
* The actual letter from the CBO office: http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/113xx/doc11343/03-15-student_loan_letter.pdf
* A metric shit-ton of info on Pell Grants and how the program has changed / grown: http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/index.html

Point #3: Iraq war

* Costs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War#Financial_cost (it's a meta-article, but the sources are strong. I picked one of the LOWEST estimates for the cost of the war)
* Casualty reports: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War#U.S._armed_forces

Also, I know that a timetable was set prior to Obama taking office. He followed through on a time-table. To me that is keeping a promise.

Point #4: OBL

We all know who was president when he was killed. We can go round and round all day about classified sources and how the SEALS actually shot him blah blah blah. Last time I checked the President of the United States is the Commander in Chief of our armed forces. That means it was his call, and it happend on his watch. If you want to argue semantics then I suggest you read about the US chain of command (please see the first sentence): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_United_States_Armed_Forces 

Point #5: Dodd-Frank

* Wikipedia has yet another fantastic article about this (243 cited sources): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act

Yes, it's controversial, and no, we haven't been able to truly measure the effectiveness. This act was the definition of compromise, with lots of amendments, changes, etc. Regardless, it is a major piece of regulatory legislation.

Point #6: Obamacare

* Healthcare expenditures as a percent of GDP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:International_Comparison_-_Healthcare_spending_as_%25_GDP.png
* Fresh data is always available at: http://www.oecd.org/statistics/
* My one admission is not defining what ""major categories"" of public health are. Here is what I was talking about:
* WHO Study in 2000 (admittedly, not a great source because it's old): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems
* OECD briefing on US healthcare costs and effectiveness: http://www.oecd.org/health/HealthSpendingInUSA_HealthData2012.pdf
* 38th in life expectancy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy 
* 34th in infant mortality: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate 
* 55th in number of doctors per 1000 people: http://www.who.int/gho/health_workforce/physicians_density/en/index.html (you have to click into the data to get the ranking)

Note: This does not mean we're below 25 in EVERY metric. We're good at a lot of things, but our overall outlook of health is decidedly average.

Point #7: Tax cuts for small business

* Here is a very right-leaning article questioning Obama's claims of 18 tax cuts during the debate. In reality, there were 14: http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/24/smallbusiness/obama-tax-cuts/
* I do not have the energy to provide links to 14 different tax codes. I'd rather watch my cat clean his ass than look through tax code to find the details on these.

In terms of other points:

* Romney's tax plan (where he states clearly his plan to cut marginal rates by 20%): http://www.mittromney.com/sites/default/files/shared/the_romney_program_for_economic_recovery_growth_and_jobs.pdf
* Romney's tax plan (opinion piece that summarizes the issue beautifully) http://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2012/10/04/about-mitt-romneys-5-trillion-tax-cut/
* Leveraged buyouts from Bain Capital during Romney's tenure there: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain_Capital

We do exist.",205,78,261,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/xlej0/im_a_conservative_republican_and_i_support/,"Reddit seems to have a majority population of more liberal type individuals that are constantly jabbing at the conservative Reddit population.  

I would just like you to know that there are conservatives who support Barack Obama, and have nothing but bad things to say about Romney (henceforth referred to as Mittens for your reading pleasure).  I am one of those conservatives.  I am religious, I own and regularly operate firearms (That's a republican thing, right?), I am not a liberal arts major (Accounting), and I believe in most things that come with being a conservative individual from the South.  

However, there are many conservatives around me that think I am absolutely crazy.  I am against homosexuality itself, for personal reasons.  I am not against gay marriage or relationships, and am more than happy to have a drink or befriend anyone, despite their sexual orientation.  I have my views, they have theirs.  And yes, that means I support Chick-Fil-A.  I am against abortion, because I believe that people need to accept responsibility to the consequences of their actions, and yet I also believe that abortion is sometimes worthy to consider in special circumstances.  I am pro-military, and anti-immigration (illegal).  And yet...

I completely support Obamacare and the healthcare reform that comes along with it.  There are parts I disagree with, but I think it is a great step in the right direction.  I have watched many programs on television featuring Obama (shows in the military channel and discovery channel), and I think he is a great person in general, and is doing his best for this country.  He's a good president, and strives to make America better as a whole, rather than just focusing on one political party.  He risked his presidency with the assault on Bin Laden, and he knew that beforehand.  I'm not here to discuss the assault itself and the political can of worms that comes along with it, but am here to present Mr. Obama's willingness to risk his presidency to do what he thought was best.  This speaks volumes of his character.  I fully support him in this next election, and would love to have dinner or a drink with him.  He has my utmost respect.

Mittens, on the other hand, has no idea what he is doing, and is running for president simply because he can.  He thrives off of the sense of power it gives him, and uses his vast amount of wealth as a financial and life cushion.  This essentially allows him to attempt to do whatever the heck he wants to do, including running for president, and the views and thoughts that accompany that.  He wants the prestige, recognition, and power that being president would bring to him, and yet he is too much of a slime ball to be anything but bad for this country.  He is not president material, because I believe that his heart, mind, and wallet are too tainted and stuffed to serve the American people.  He would not view the Presidency as a service, he would view it as power.  Obama, on the other hand, is actively doing everything he can to serve the American people.

Now you know where I stand and what my views are.  I do not care for up votes or down votes (check my previous comments, I really don't care about up votes or down votes at all).  I don't mind if only 3 people see this post, or 3,000.  I would just like to get my views out to someone that might understand, and let the liberal population of Reddit know that there are conservative republicans out there that are on the same side as them.  We are not your enemies, and our political parties are not meant to be enemies.  They are meant to bring balance to things.  I know at least someone will read this, and I'd love to hear your thoughts or comments on what I have said.

Long story short, there are conservative republicans that are still on your side, and support President Obama.

Also, if there is a subreddit more suitable for this type of post, let me know!  I wasn't sure where to put it, so I just picked one that seemed accepting of it.

UPDATE: thanks the the encouragement of a fellow redditor, I have posted this in /r/politics as well.  I have no idea how it will be received there, but you guys are more than welcome to check it out for yourself, and if you don't mind, maybe help me out if things get sour.  I've seen that the vast majority of you are very sensible and respectful people, which I can't say the same about /r/politics, so I will be grateful for any help you can provide.

UPDATE AGAIN:  Good holy gracious, I am shocked and humbled by how well Reddit has received this viewpoint.

I was thinking about it last night and I couldn't really come up with anything I was satisfied with.

Although it doesn't hold much water, here's my view:

A tax is something you pay so the government provides certain needed services. Everyone benefits from these services. Now, imagine a person who manufactures a very popular good or provides a very popular service. This person's earnings come from others in the same society. He benefits from those other people using the services provided by the government, and so it is in his interest to pay taxes somewhat proportional to the amount of people that are his customers.

Again, I'm not really glad with the above explanation, so I'm asking you to justify that people who earn more should pay a larger tax.

1366745247.0,120,self.PoliticalDiscussion,1cyeqr,Cispa response email From Congressman John J. Duncan Jr. (R),133,13,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1cyeqr/cispa_response_email_from_congressman_john_j/,"I emailed Congressman Duncan about his ""Yay"" vote on CISPA and why he made it. It was sent as follows.



""Thank you for contacting me regarding H.R. 624 – the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). It is always a pleasure to hear from those that I represent in Congress.

Every day U.S. businesses are targeted by thousands of  state employed hackers working for the  government s of China ,  Iran, North Korea, and Russia. These hacks result in the loss of valuable intellectual pro perty and sensitive information—$500 billion  worth in  just  the last year. This is the largest theft in the history of the world.
 
The Chinese and Russians are literally robbing us blind,  and there is currently nothing that the U.S. government can do to stop it. 

Our Nation has spies in China and these other countries, so our intelligence community has knowledge of secret techniques that the Chinese , Russians, and Iranians employ to rob American owned businesses. Because this information is classified, the U.S. government cannot adequately warn private businesses how to better protect themselves.

The government currently has no methodology for sharing  such information with the private sector. You would think that we already do, but the government is desperately trying to play catch-up with advances in technology.

CISPA would allow the U.S. government to share classified information with private American businesses, so these businesses can adjust their website filters to new and classified threat signatures.
 
I voted in favor of CISPA. I  did this only after I received multiple classified briefing on all aspects of the bill.

As a former trial judge, I am very leery of giving our government any more authority than it already has.

I believe that some counterterrorism powers granted to the federal government since 9/11 have gone too far.

We have been expanding federal police powers so much in the last few years that we are losing a balance between security and liberty.
 
I am satisfied that CISPA will not expand government intrusion into the lives of Americans. I strongly oppose any bill that would allow the government to spy on U.S. citizens.

CISPA specifically prohibits the government from searching your library records, what books you buy, your firearm sales record, what ammunition you buy, your tax returns, your education records, and your medical records. The federal government cannot and shall not snoop into your private lives.

Furthermore, CISPA does not allow the government to use any information that could be used to identify an individual.

What CISPA does do is protect our businesses from continually being robbed by the Chinese. It allows private businesses to have someone on their payroll receive a security clearance, at no cost to the federal government, so that person can learn from the government the latest techniques the Chinese are using to rob their business.

These businesses will work with the federal government on a strictly voluntary basis. Nothing in CISPA can force the private sector to participate in information sharing.

CISPA would also allow the private sector to share with the government ways that the Chinese and other hackers att ack their systems and network. Our g overnment networks are attacked every day and are increasingly becoming more vulnerable. The Chinese, Iranians, and North Koreans would love nothing more than to be able to affect our Nation's po wer grid, nuclear power plants, water resources,  and defense systems.

I have always said that the private sector is more innovative than the federal government. I believe that advances in the private sector can help keep our Nation safe from foreign interference.
 
Cyber threats evolve at the speed of technology. It may surprise you to know that the Chinese government is already spying on American citizens by reading our emails, seeing our search histories, and monitoring what we purchase. 
 
It is the duty of the United States government to protect its citizens and its territory from threats both foreign and domestic. This includes protecting U.S. digital territory. But, and I cannot stress this enough, CISPA focuses on keeping foreign hackers from spying on and attacking  our businesses, infrastructure, and our citizens . CISPA does not give the government the authority to monitor your networks or emails. CISPA does not give the government the authority to shut down websites. And CISPA  does not allow the government to amass data on U.S. citizens. 
 
The business community overwhelmingly supports CISPA. Because companies are being robbed blind, CISPA is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, GOOGLE, AT&amp;T, Verizon, IBM,  Microsoft, Intel ,  Oracle , and many  many more.  And because Americans are being spied on by the Chinese and Russians,  Facebook also supports CISPA. You may be surprised to know that the Chinese use  Facebook to spy on U.S. citizens. 

Finally, CISPA grants individual citizens, who feel that the government violated their privacy by sharing information with companies, the right to sue the government. This is a right that is currently not enjoyed under U.S. law.

I believe it is paramount that U.S. citizens have recourse  against the government if they feel they have been wronged. 

I hope this better explains my vote.""

The argument that ""if you have nothing to hide"" makes sense in this respect because you would have to be a person of interest in the first place to even have the patriot act used against you.

What the government is doing now is simply transitioning into a police state.

And by proxy , be able to non violently destroy any anti-government dissent by digging through private information for obscure infractions and other such things. 

""but the government would never do this!"" 

They already have with the IRS. So the question of ""would our government really do hollywood level police state shit?"" Is no longer a question , they have and will use the state against political dissidents now and in the future.....

Unless we stop it.

If we are really serious about doing something about gun violence we should be looking at ways to reform our drug laws, increase education, and provide support for these communities. Taking away an AR-15 from some random guy living on a farm in Nebraska won't do much to control gun violence. It's a band-aid on the much larger issue of poverty in the US.

[Here's the ad](http://youtu.be/bZxs09eV-Vc).

Now, it could be said that it's very important to recognize that Romney's vagueness about budgetary plans makes this an important piece of news to hold on to.  It reminds us of the public radio funding crisis that happened not too long ago.  However, this is a giant turd of misinformation and misdirection, and it's depressing to see the Obama camp (whom, in my perspective, tends to follow at least a decently intellectual and informative approach to campaigning) jump all over it for cheap votes.

My arguments are thus:

1. Big Bird and Sesame Street are not reliant on PBS for funding.  PBS is their preferred broadcasting venue, as far as I understand it.  That means that if PBS was suddenly taken off air, Seasme Street and the Seasme Workshop NPO would have to move the program somewhere else.  Seasme Street, which still has admirable ratings and has been around since 1969, would probably have little problem finding a network to pick it back up eventually.

2. Big Bird is not representative of PBS.  PBS is a large network of services that encompass a lot of things.  To focus on some particular aspect of PBS is to detract from the larger argument Mitt Romney has.

3. The specific Obama ad seems to give the impression that Mitt Romney...well...just 'has it out' for Big Bird or PBS, like he's some sort of children-educating hating bigot.  Shouldn't it be reasonable to expect that someone running for the highest executive position in the country would have some sort of sound or statistically reasonable philosophy for determining government funding priorities?  The fact is, we don't know what Mitt Romney's specific reasons are, and while that may be Romney's fault for not expounding on his intensions and paths of reason, saying that he's misguided because he wants to 'get rid of Big Bird' is jumping to conclusions and misleading.

4.  I can not stress this enough.  **Mitt Romney or any POTUS does not have the ability to cut funding to PBS** or immediately cut funding to any government program.  That job is for Congress.  The President can make executive recommendation.  They can convene Congress under an issue, but if you really want to save PBS, elect a Representative or Senator that claims they will preserve PBS funding if it comes to a vote.

*edit* 

1.  While PBS does not directly give funding to Sesame Street, they do provide a venue for ad free running.  If Seasme Street were to move, they would perhaps have to move to a monetary ad model, which could arguably distort the programming.

4.  It has been pointed out that the President does have the ability to directly amend budgetary items via a [line-item veto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto#United_States), although this veto can be overruled by Congress like any other.  However, the original point still stands -- The President cannot immediately and directly affect funding for public programs without the aid of Congress.

*edit2*

4.  It has been pointed out by another person that the line-item veto was actually ruled unconstitutional in 1998.  The concept of of an executive line-item veto seems to have a full and recent history.

Anyone participating in this program would be provided with resources to look for jobs and prepare for interviews, as well as unlimited time off to actually go on job interviews.

The thought behind this is that it would:

* Give unemployed people a feeling of purpose and help avoid the lethargy that can come with having nothing to do each day

* Avoid big lapses in time on a person's resume, which is often a red flag for a potential employer

* Provide people with experience outside of their normal area of work

* Help the community by providing valuable services at no additional cost (unemployment is already being paid out)

* Remove the stigma that unemployed people are ""lazy"" or ""don't really want a job""

* Remove abuse of the system by the small population of people that actually don't want to find a job or who work off the books while collecting unemployment

 I am employed by the Dept. of the Navy in a Naval shipyard on the east coast. I have been a welder in the private sector for 20 years before being hired by the navy 16 months ago. I am currently working on the nuclear power systems on many different ships and submarines. The work we do is critical to the lives of sailors as well as the public the resides around where these ships are stationed. Mistakes are not an option.
 You are probably assuming I make huge sums of money and rape the taxpayer. I make around $43,000 a year before taxes. I do realize that I won't receive much compassion from many of you who do not make close to that but all things considered, I could make 3 times that amount in the private sector.

You think that what they are talking about is just the various offices and departments that are wasteful but I will tell you the truth. Back in the 40's to the 60's, the shipyards were completely self sufficient. They produced and built everything needed to repair and maintain navy ships. Slowly that has gone away, a little at a time, until now when most of the parts are subbed out to contractors. It is happening now and getting worse. Do we want our warships being worked on and maintained by outside contractors who may have questionable owners? 
 I am an American just like anyone else. I love my country and will do my best to ensure the ships I work on will always perform as expected.

**1** **Stop calling this man a hero.** Seriously, I don't care if you believe in the cause he did this for or not we shouldn't be putting this guy on a pedestal. If you are participating in civil disobedience, part of that action, according to Henry David Thoreau, is to be willing to pay the price for those crimes. Look at Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks, and Ghandi. These people are heroes. They stood up to injustice peacefully and paid the price, sometimes with their lives. *That's* heroic. Turning tail to China and Russia with a backpack full of secrets to sell is a coward's tactic. It’s the difference between being a whistle blower and committing treason.

Also don't take everything Snowden says at face value. In my opinion, he was overselling the info we had and what he really knows to make his product more appealing to the Chinese. The claims he was making seemed very far-fetched for someone in his position, and if he was planning to sell his information it stands to reason that he would try to make it sound more attractive for potential buyers. I can’t point to a lot of hard facts to back this up, but call it a hunch.


**2** To think that the NSA even has the capability to read every person's emails and listen to every person's phone calls is ludicrous. Do they collect everyone's meta-data? Yes. Is it illegal? No. Should we be discussing the merits of it is legal or not? **ABSOLUTELY.**

BUT...that conversation needs to be driven by FACTS, not fear mongering and speculation.

To think that the NSA has enough analysts to actually look at the content of everyone's communications data is a fantasy. Even if they had the capacity, the legal safeguards of preventing them from targeting innocent Americans means people can't just be targeted without reasonable suspicion without at judicial warrant.

I do get that the court that approves this activity is secret by nature, and I think it's fair to expect more transparency not just from this, but in general about this program. I feel that this should have been made public when it was implemented so we could discuss this in the public forum rather than it being leaked. PRISM is an instance where I feel the government used classification to shield their political reputation rather than national security.


**3** Like it or not, signals intelligence (SIGINT) is a necessity for tracking terrorists around the world. SIGINT is the foundation of intelligence against terrorists and other disciplines can't stand without it.  The capabilities that the NSA data collection gives us are instrumental in this sense. I do think we, as a country, need to have a discussion about just how threatening terrorism really is and how much of our fear is just a hangover from 9/11. In my opinion, terrorism is still a concern that necessitates a vibrant intelligence community that can handle such elusive threats. In that sense, I am more concerned about the potential for lives to be lost rather than my meta-data being stored.


**4** Regarding Germany's complaints toward the United States about spying on the EU and Snowden saying that they are ""in bed with each other"": he's right in a sense. Obviously friendly countries share intelligence. This is nothing new. But I would also have to assume Germany's outrage over the US spying on them is an act, or just extremely naïve. In the nation state system we live in, states don't have fixed allies, only interests. Every country spies on every other country, no matter what their allegiances are. Espionage isn't an act of war. It's how the game is played in this system. Even if you don't want to do that, it's irresponsible as a nation since your obligation is the safety and well-being of your people. If everyone else is doing it and you aren't, you're at a huge disadvantage. If the Germans are so upset, they should get better counter intelligence. This is obviously a very geopolitical/realpolitik take, and that philosophy has its flaws. But it's an accurate descriptor of the international system that we live in, which, in my opinion, works better than what humanity has tried in the past.



Anyway this is my opinion and feel free to respectfully engage me if you agree or disagree. And even though I disagree with how the part of the argument that is most prominent on reddit is taking over the conversation, it's still a conversation worth having. Keep speaking your mind and contact your congressional representatives and let them know how their constituents feel. An informed and honest electorate is what drives a successful democracy.

**TL;DR: Don't be lazy. Read things if you want to discuss them.**

**Edit:** formatting

**Edit 2:** Wow I didn't think this was going to get any attention. Thanks for the generally good and civil responses. I don't have time to respond to everyone here but I'm glad I fostered some debate. I did want to add a few things in general:

Sorry I didn't source all my arguments and but I'm doing this from my iPad with average Wi-fi so I couldn't put a ton of research time into it. I'll plan a little better next time. Also this is mostly my informed opinion and doesn't have any more or less merit than reddit's other opinions. I just wanted to try to give a voice to the minority that the main subs/most upvoted posts didn't reflect.

1371219593.0,116,self.PoliticalDiscussion,1gc7in,"Is anyone else freaked out by the ""nothing to hide"" dialogue? Not the mindset, the way that it's being used.",145,29,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gc7in/is_anyone_else_freaked_out_by_the_nothing_to_hide/,"So, back when wiretapping was a conversation unto itself 2002 03 ish, the rallying cry in defense of the Patriot act and other such measures was the same thing. There was a lot more ""If you've..."" instead of ""I've"",  but it was still from the same people. The end result was a shift in the public concept of what could be expected of a phone call, the possibility of someone listening in, the idea that what was occuring was much more public. Warrants made a shift in the public mind towards being for more concrete things like property and people.
There's plenty of debate to be had about how the government uses public data (allegedly, fuck you Facebook, Google), and how they should probably be limited to a much greater degree, but trusting in the morality of composite entities like corporations or governments is foolhardy.  

When you make a call to grandma, you aren't calling grandma *and* the connectign operator. When you send a package or letter, there needs to be probable cause in order to open it, else it should arrive unmolested. Without encrypting email though, it's like sending a letter without an envelope. Any perceived expectation of privacy is completely lacking of anything to actually support it, and you've got the same false sense of security as being naked in the wilderness, and the same sort of outrage as though a man in a stars and stripes stovepipe was looking at you from the bushes. Frankly, I'm of the opinion that it would be more prudent to be more active in making data private than trusting the metaphorical crack addict to not grab the metaphorical unattended crack left on a park bench. Not to forgive prism, but it goes both ways.

The part that scares me a bit though, is that the reflexive ""nothing to hide"" dialogue moves the conversation away from ""why did you expect that to be private"" to ""you should expect that not to be private"". By so vigorously pushing this, the damage is already being done by establishing in any relevant discussions as being over  whether they overreached or not instead of why what they did was a violation of a public and most probably admittedly subjective expectation of privacy.

In the early 2000's, it was much easier to utilize a fear tactic to eliminate that expectation and make way, but now, having already done the deed, it is very much in the interest of the government to make sure that everyone is of the mindset that what you put on the internet, generally, is as public as your trash. Conveniently timed decision to intervene in Syria (having used chemical warfare is not news to anyone) provides a distraction, providing ample room to limit the discussion of prism before it ends up in front of any sort of judicial body. Those members are still of the public, after all. Securing the need for a direct, legislative measure to stop it... see where it starts to get under my skin? Being the first, or at least loudest amongst the early, it put a big ol lightning rod in it to get everyone on the tagline that puts them in the most advantageous position. It's getting harder to imagine it being unintentional, but regardless, the 'nothing to hide' mentality in a real world context is the exact reason a warrant is needed to get into a house. The main thing that would condemn them as having committed an unconstitutional act instead of being in a legal battle, that unconscious an implicit expectation of the privacy of your personal email as an analog to your postage, is a non-issue if the general public pulls the same negligence to that expectation now as they did to it's counter then, which is very conveniently done by getting everyone to talk about whether there's something incriminating there instead of why it shouldn't matter one way or the other.

The fact that I tried to write this post three separate times prior on a mobile device, only to have it crash every time I started typing envelope, patriot, encryption, or prism, really does nothing to soothe my very tired mind, but this is legitimately worrisome. Public! Acknowledge the fact that you expected on some level your personal emails to be private! For my sake? I'm really more curious about what reddit might think about this as potentially an indirect tactic, but really, am I crazy for having that expectation when I'm not using a business or school email?

1. America does best when the middle class does best

2. Romney's tax plan calls for 2T in additinoal mil spending the military didn't ask for

3. Romney's tax plans calls for 5trillion tax cut in addition to renewing the $2trillion Bush tax cuts (Romney's proposal calls for a 5 trillion dollar tax cut, on top of 2 trillion more by the military, he says he's going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.)

1. It is NOT POSSIBLE to pay for Romney's plan without increasing the tax burden on either the middle class or the upper class; loophole elimination won't pay for it

1. oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years /u/immerc

1. We cut taxes for middle class families by $3600

1. When you add up loopholes and deductions that upper income people have, you don't pay for 5trillion in costs (When you close loopholes you don't come anywhere close to paying for Romney's plan /u/immerc) 

1. Only way to pay for Romney's policies is for increased burden on middle class 

1. Romney believes top 3% are small businesses

1. I've cut taxes... (didn't get whole claim)

1. Under my plan, 97% of small businesses would not see their tax rates go up. Under Governor Romney's definition, some millionaires and billionaires are small businesses, Donald Trump is a small business. /u/immerc

1. Clinton created 23million jobs under the plan Obama is proposing. The approach that Romney is talking about is the same approach talked about in 2001-2002. It led to the crash. Bill Clinton tried the approach I'm talking about, and businesses did well. (help w/ /u/immerc)

1. We went after Medical/medicare fraud, etc. Saved $50 billion in waste

1. Made largest cut since Eisenhower

1. Put forward $4 trillion? deficit reduction plan

1. Plan asks for $1 in additional revenue in exchange for $X in cuts

1. When I walked into the oval office, I had 2 trillion in debt waiting for me. 77 government programs, 18 government programs for government education, we have 50 billion in waste taken out of the system. /u/immerc

1. Romney (somehow) causes 30% cut in ...something involving nursing homes

1. Romney has ruled out revenue

1. ""The oil industry gets $4 billion/year in corporate welfare. /u/lennybird /u/axon350

1. ""You can take a tax deduction for moving a plant overseas.""

1.  30% cut in medicaid over time by shifting responsibilities to states. /u/immerc

1. Medicare is the biggest driver of our deficits 

1. 716 billion dollars, we were able to save from medicaire, by no longer overpaying providers, lower prescriptions by an avg of $600. /u/immerc

1. Romney would use ""premium support"" for medicaire, which is a voucher program. /u/immerc

1. The voucher system would not keep up with healthcare inflation (and would cost the average senior $6k a year."" /u/lennybird

1. Every healthcare economist who looks at Romney's plan says that it will collapse. /u/FlyreFiend

1. health care companies under Romney's plan will make billions /u/immerc

1. Voucher system puts old people at mercy of the insurance companies 

1. If you repeal Obamacare, the primary beneficiary will be insurance companies. /u/axon350

1. When you move to a voucher system, seniors are at the mercy of insurance companies, and they're stuck. This is the reason that AARP has said that Romney's plan would weaken Medicare.. AARP says Romney's plan will weaken medicare /u/immerc, /u/oldpplfreakmeout, /u/axon350 /u/lennybird

1. every study has shown that medicaire has lower admin. costs than private programs /u/immerc

1. Banks were making money hand over fist in order to make profits but knowing it made the system vulnerable

1. We had the toughest reforms on wall street since the 1930s

1. Romney has said in the past that he wants to replace Dodd-Frank

1. We made sure that every single dime we loaned the banks was paid back with interest. /u/axon350

1. The reason we have been in such an economic crisis was reckless behavior across the board, not just wall street. ... ""We stepped in, and had the toughest reforms on wall street since the 1930s""... ""You (banks) have to have a living will so we know how you'll wind things down if you have a bad bet."" In the past Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd Frank. /u/immerc

1. Obamacare isn't a government takeover, you keep your own doctor, insurance can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits, have to keep kid on your insurance until 26, also have to give rebates if spending more on administrative costs and profit than on care. If you have health insurance, Obamacare doesn't mean a gov't takeover, but says insurance companies can't impose arbitrary limits, have to let you keep your kid on your program till they're 26. You'll have to get rebates if your insurance company is spending more on admin costs and profits than care. ""The irony is, we've seen this work really well in Massachusetts, ... essentially the identical model."" /u/ immerc

1. Healthcare premiums in the last 2 years have gone up slower than anytime in the last 50 years

1. Repealing Obamacare will result in 50mil people losing health insurance /u/oldpplfreakmeout

1. We used the same advisors (as Romney) and they say it's the same plan. The board Romney talks about is a panel of experts (doctors, etc.) who look for ways to reduce costs in the system. Cleveland Clinic provides great care cheaper than average by procedural tweaks. The board identifies best practices and uses the uses the purchasing power of medicare to get good deals. Over the last 2 years, health care premiums have gone up slower than any time over the last 50 years. Repealing Obamacare means 50 million people will lose insurance. /u/immerc

1. ""Board cannot make decisions on treatment given."" (obamacare) /u/lennybird

1. Romney can't detail how he'll replace Obamacare /u/oldpplfreakmeout

1. Romney's healthcare plan was ""the largest"" expansion of private insurance (compared to?) /u/turmoil159

1. Romney's plan already duplicates what's in the law and doesn't do more for pre-existing conditions. Says if you're out of work for 3 months an insurance company can't deny you for that period. /u/immerc

1.  Race to the Top said that states would get more money if the instituted reforms, and 46 states made a significant difference. 46 states have ""made a real difference"" under reach to the top(?) Gov. Romney doesn't think we need more teachers. That will create jobs because companies want to locate where there's an educated workforce. /u/axon350, /u/immerc

1. Romney doesn't think we need more teachers. /u/oldpplfreakmeout

1. ""Ryan's budget looks to cut education budget by 20%."" (""when extrapolated."") /u/lennybird, /u/axon350, /u/turmoil159

1. Kept student loan interest rates low by cutting banks out of the loan process (himself) /u/turmoil159

1. ""Romney said, 'you should borrow money from your parents in order to go to college.'"" /u/lennybird

1. Republicans fought against (increased restrictions on Wall Street, I think?)

1. [I have] signed three trade deals to help double exports to sell more american products throughout the world /u/oldpplfreakmeout

1357714101.0,115,self.PoliticalDiscussion,168j6a,Why I hate the Babyboomers: A rant.,199,84,308,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/168j6a/why_i_hate_the_babyboomers_a_rant/,"I'm 100% all for eliminating social security entitlements. I put 10% of my gross income into a retirement fund, specifically because an entitlement such as social security for people my age is a fucking pipe dream. It's interesting that babyboomers, a generation of Americans who grew up in the most prosperous time ever experienced on planet earth, have the balls to call millennials the ""entitlement generation."" These are the same people who have enjoyed unparalleled growth of personal wealth, low inflation, access to reasonably priced goods such as food and fuel, services such as reasonably priced educations and health care, and interest rates on mortgages and loans scraping the bottom of barrel, yet couldn't plan for their fucking retirements. 


I look at what the future holds for my generation, and the future looks bleak. For a young man or woman entering university this year with no help from their parents, the average education costs, excluding room and board, will set these individuals back somewhere in the neighborhood of $50,000-$100,000 depending on the type of institution entered. Interest rates on education loans add another $10-30k to the debt load. Meanwhile, if a graduate is fortunate enough to find immediate employment, they can expect an average starting salary of $44,259, or $3,866.25/month. At a generous tax rate of 11%, the average yearly salary drops to $39,189/year or $3,265.75/month. Loan payments over 20 years on $100,000 education put the monthly income at around $2,700/month. Factor in $1000/month for housing and utilities leaves a recent graduate at $1,700/ month. Let's factor another $500/month on car payments and insurance for a vehicle because frankly, most people require transportation to and from their place of employment. We are left with $1,200. According to the USDA, The Low-Cost Food Plan is often used by the bankruptcy courts to determine the portion of a bankrupt person’s income to allocate to necessary food expenses at $227/ month. This leaves the graduate with $973/month. Factoring in another $100/ month for fuel and $50 for a cellphone, a graduate is left with $823/month. 


Now, I'm not trying to turn my nose up at $823/month. That's a lot of money after all of the ""necessities"" are taken care of. But realistically, the expenses don't end there. Earlier, I said I put 10% of my gross monthly earnings toward retirement, but for the sake of argument let's say the individual puts 5% of $3,866/month away for retirement. That comes to $193/month, leaving the graduate with $630/ month. But what about healthcare? Because frankly, it's been made clear by the boomers that they are not interested in paying for the healthcare of entry level employees. Another $183/month can be factored into monthly expenses. The graduate is left with $447/month. Now, assuming the graduate has absolutely no interest in recreation whatsoever, they take that $447/month and save it for a down payment on a house. It will take the graduate 5 years to save $26,820, roughly 20% needed for a down payment on a $120,000 house. Meanwhile, the graduate will have spent (pretty much thrown away) $48,000 on rent in 5 years which could have gone toward a mortgage.


Now, I don't know about you, but it seems that the millennial generation is getting fucked here. We're a generation of people who basically become slaves to credit for a life time, yet we came from a generation of people who could pay for their education by working at fucking dairy queen. Our minimum wage jobs worked in college went toward putting a fucking roof over our heads and food in our mouths. I'm not trying to say that everybody in my generation has had this experience, but this is the true cost of being self-made for my generation. On the other side of the coin, we will enjoy limited upward mobility at our jobs because the god-damned baby boomers didn't have the foresight to plan for retirement, and now refuse to vacate their upper echelon positions which pay more money than the entry level position. Couple that with rampant greed on part of the boomers who have no problem busting unions, raiding corporate coffers, and rigging the corporate structure to work against graduates entering the workforce. In reality, it is the baby boomers who have been handed the world on a silver platter. It is the baby boomers who have mandated that our healthcare is an unjustifiable expense, it is the boomers who have driven up the cost on the millennial generation, it is the boomers who have failed the tests of personal responsibility, and it is the boomers standing with their hands out depending on my generation to pay for their twilight years. And they still have the audacity to call us the entitlement generation. Cocksuckers. 

**Edit**
Reddit, you have inspired me. I must admit that this rant came from deep within me and I would like to take a step back and say that it was wrong for me to make broad generalizations about an entire generation of Americans. I realize that the behavior I attributed to the baby boomer generation does not apply to every single person born in that era. My frustration stems from the fact that, undeniably, the baby boomer generation has enjoyed the greatest leap in prosperity ever experienced by man-kind, and born from that prosperity came greed unmatched by any other group of people in human history. This is evident in Reagan era trickle down economics, and continues today with a major lack of regulatory oversight of financial institutions. I don't understand how anybody can justify such individualistic viewpoints when the topic of universal healthcare is discussed, yet turn around with hands outstretched demanding medicaid and social security payments. 

I have read many responses from members of the boomer generation who bring up the war in vietnam, speaking of sacrifices made by young men conscripted into the military, and how my generation has had the comfort of not making similar sacrifices. I have read several times about how I come off as coddled, ungrateful, and ignorant to the world. Although I can not form an accurate opinion as to the sacrifices a generation had to make based on the experience of living through that era, I can tell you that my generation has sacrificed life and limb in similar shit-holes for similar political motivations. The only difference being, we were members of an ALL volunteer force. I sacrificed when I trekked 100lbs worth of gear through the forsaken land of Afghanistan fighting an invisible enemy who lives in a land never conquered by an invading force. I didn't do it because it was the right thing to do, but because my country asked this of me. I lost 2 brothers to enemy fire, and another lost his leg to a booby trap. I appreciate the flags and the personal thanks, but to say we haven't sacrificed on the scale of Nam vets is pure conjecture. 

As I said at the top of my edit, reddit has inspired me. I realize now that millennials must stand to be counted, that we require a political voice. From what I have read, many of my contemporaries share similar sentiments to myself, yet we lack unification and a voice.

I hold a particularly unpopular opinion, and I find it fitting to discuss it on Veteran's Day: I do not support the military of the US (where I'm from), nor do I support the individual soldiers.

Because the US has a volunteer military, and I fundamentally disagree with the wars we are fighting and most of those we have fought, I do not believe it is my duty to respect, cherish, support, or even acknowledge the legitimacy of the troops. They fight and kill people in other countries, yet because our government says it's okay, it is socially acceptable. I see them as no better than hitman, except that most people are okay with what they do.

If one studies the history of US military actions, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_military_operations[1] ), it is clear that our military is primarily used for government intervention for resource-driven warfare, international political control, and furthering of ideology. I am not a pacifist; I believe that violence is sometimes justified, particularly against other forms of violence. However, the American government's actions do not center around self-defense.

Therefore, I see the murders performed by members of the US military as disgusting, and I do not condone their actions as legitimate.

2. Discuss ideas rather than candidates when discussing an issue. Instead of a title like ""Why does Romney hate Big Bird"", a title like ""Are public broadcast stations worth subsidizing?"" is much better and allows for broader discussion.

3. An exception to this would be, discussing the merits/costs of a particular candidates position. A good title would be ""Is Obama's foreign policy on the israeli/palestinian conflict a good policy?"".

We thought we could build a system that could rise above human corruptibility, whose equality could not be negated by greed and the lust for power.  Ya, that worked out well.


At the end of the day, greed is inherent in humans, and we're just idiots if we expect anything less in a society (capitalist) that tells us from day one the number 1 goal you should have in life is to make more money than the next guy.

When this country was founded the Church had gained far too much power.  It prompted an entirely new nation and form of gov't to be formed on the basis of 'separation of church and state'.  Fast forward 200+ years, and it seems that today the path to power is wealth.  The ideal of our constitution point towards a system in which the voice of every citizen is held in equal regard, and the representatives are well, fucking representative of whatever that public opinion may be.  I seriously doubt we envisioned a system where the representatives make more than twice as much as the average citizen.  I seriously doubt we envisioned a system in which one can influence the outcome of their local, state, and national elections with something other than their vote. ($$$$$)  When the church had overstepped its bounds of power too far, a radical change was made.  I believe that wealth has overstepped its bounds of power, and that we need to take 'separation of wealth and state' just as seriously.

tl;dr: Congress should make around the same amount of money as the average middle class citizen in order to promote a congress that is  *actually* representative.

He is a fiscally conservative republican, while I tend to lead more liberal on the social issues. He and I were talking about the republican's recent gerrymandering antics and their implecations. I just thought it'd be a great topic for us to discuss, as its easy to mistakenly view this as a 'evil republican' tactic. Here's an exerpt to start off the discussion.

**Problem**

This really has been going on for ages, and in multiple countries around the world: (Since 1812 in the US, when the term was first applied) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering

The reason so many district lines are drawn to favor Republicans currently is simply because they happened to have control of more state legislatures in 2011, after the 2010 census. One case where they didn't was Illinois, which now has gerrymandered districts heavily favoring Democrats:

* http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2011/0608/Democrats-revenge-in-2012-a-radical-Illinois-gerrymander

* Particularly interesting on the second page of that article is the note that in 1981, Democrat-directed redistricting in California ""turned a 1-seat deficit to a 9-seat majority"".

* Perhaps not surprisingly, 1981 is one of only 4 redistrictings since 1874 for which no maps are available here: http://www.joincalifornia.com/page/8

* You can see the 1981 California districts here, though:
http://cdm15831.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/ric/id/5161

* You'll find districts that look as wild as anything in a Republican-controlled state today. In the statewide congressional districts (page 3), you've got 12, 18, and 20, in the LA area (page 4), you have districts 27, 30, 32, and 34, but the real prize is district 45 in San Diego (page 7). (I thought districts had to at least be geographically contiguous, but apparently not, at least in California in 1981.) One last: District 18, in Fresno, page 10


I'm certainly not saying that Republicans don't gerrymander, or that it isn't wrong, just that it's nothing new or unique to Republicans, and liberals have no basis for throwing any stones in that particular glass house. 

**Solution?** 

As for how to fix it, I like the idea of a non-partisan or bi-partisan commission that's not allowed to consider political divisions, combined with the ""minimum district to convex polygon ratio"" rule, as described in the Wikipedia article. Iowa has a non-partisan commission, plus the requirement that counties not be split, with the result that they have a pretty simple map:

* http://www.senate.iowa.gov/democrats/iowa-election-boundaries-to-change/ They're still a bit odd-shaped, though, something the convex polygon ratio would address.

1358619272.0,104,self.PoliticalDiscussion,16vvgw,40% of guns are sold via gun shows where no background check is required (Politifact: Mostly True),172,68,253,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/16vvgw/40_of_guns_are_sold_via_gun_shows_where_no/,"[Link](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/25/michael-bloomberg/mayor-michael-bloomberg-says-40-percent-guns-are-s/)

Obama used this in his gun control speech. I was suprised by this, I thought gun shows required background checks except in unusual cases (was thinking 2-3% of all sales). Politifact says: 

&gt; Investigators found that a quarter of the vendors were private sellers, not licensed dealers, and reported that ""felons and other prohibited persons who want to avoid Brady Act checks and records of their purchase buy firearms at these shows.""

&gt; Mayor Bloomberg said 40 percent of gun sales take place through gun shows or the Internet.

&gt;The best information on the informal gun market is based on a survey and is about 15 years old. Current regulations don’t allow direct tallies of sales of this sort. An undercover investigation found a great deal of internet activity, but it was sponsored by a mayor who seeks greater regulation. Groups opposed to greater regulation were asked to rebut the mayor’s assertion and did not respond

And yet: 

&gt;LAPIERRE: Now, I know where you're going with this. **They come up with this whole... the gun show loophole. There's not a gun show loophole.** It's illegal for felons to do anything like that, to buy guns. What the anti-Second Amendment wants to do is put every gun sale in the country under the thumb of the federal government. Congress debated this at length. They said if you're a hobbyist or collector, if someone in West Virginia, a hunter wants to sell a gun to another hunter, they ought to be able to do it without being under the thumb of the federal government.

How come the NRA won't ditch this guy? What's the NRA's official stance on background checks for all gun show sales?

Edit: 

Definition of a loophole: 
A loophole is an ambiguity in a system, such as a law or security, which can be used to circumvent or otherwise avoid the intent, implied or explicitly stated, of the system.

Also,  this: 

&gt;Omar was challenged to go to a gun show in Virginia and buy as many guns with cash as he could.

From my point of view, democracy takes for granted that the people as a hole are smart and educated enough to make the right decisions and avoid being deceived by those better educated. But that's not the case. Half of the population in my country will vote whoever candidate looks more handsome. They don't follow a logical reasoning to vote, and they don't even know what they're really voting for. Plus, democracy is not necessarily fair, it's just the choice of the majority (might sound a little cliche, but just as a reminder, Hitler was elected democratically and had the support of the vast majority). But why should a majority have the right to deny the minorities some other rights? Should we really allow people with absolutely no education on political/economical/social matters to have as much power to decide upon the country's future as those who really have a preparation to do so? I'm thinking the least we could do is require voters a minimun level of knowledge in certain areas, and in case they don't have it, have the government provide it for free.

* In less than two days a lame duck government in Michigan passed anti-union laws in a state that has traditionally been a union stronghold, inciting massive protests. Regardless of your position on ""right to work"" legislation what's clear is that the law was clearly unpopular which is probably why the bill was pushed through so quick, disallowing any time for debate or political action. Even more disconcerting is that it was passed during a lame duck session in which 52% of the party that supported the bill lost. Many politicians said they didn't have enough time to read it with one Democrat claiming ""[this is where democracy goes to die](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=AsI2xc_FYX0)."" Some of the politicians, Governor Rick Snyder in particular, had previously said they wouldn't sign such legislation.

It has been said that one of the biggest reasons for the decline of unions is government legislation.

* EDIT: I forgot to mention that the emergency management plan also in Michigan. The pubic voted it down through referendum but, in a lame duck session where the politicians who supported were also on their way out, put it back in place.

It certainly appears that these politicians are not interested in respecting the will of the people.

I see leftists trying to equate Capitalism and the Free Market with Fascism while at the same time I see Rightists trying to equate Fascism with Socialism and Communism but in both cases **these are vastly different things**.

To try to make things simple, I will post a list of basic facts (or truths or whatever you want to call it) about Fascism and then explain afterwards how all of these things were misconstrued.

* Fascist Corporatism is a rejection of Capitalism and the Free Market.
* Fascist Corporatism is a rejection of Class Struggle.
* Fascism sought to bring about unity between each of the Classes and end class struggle entirely.
* The Fascist Corporation was actually a confederation of both Unions and Companies (workers and management) who would work together under the guidance of the State to achieve production goals. (This was a common thing to do for most Countries during wartime.)

Mussolini believed that Capitalism and the Free Market would inevitably lead to State Capitalism (when Big Businesses control the State), but he also felt that the Free Market was useful for the Industrialization of a Nation. Once a Nation was Industrialized, the State had to seize control of these industries to insure efficiency and stability of the Economy. Industries were vital to the welfare of the Nation and this meant Labor also had to be protected. This lead to the creation of Corporatism. The Corporate State forced Industry and Labor to work together and heavily regulated Big Business. Strikes as well as Lockouts were outlawed.

The reason you can't say Fascism is Socialism is because Fascism completely rejected the idea of Class Struggle. Socialism was seen as a complete failure (Mussolini and many of his fellow fascists were former Socialists). Mussolini also felt that Capital did have a place in the economy (it was a great motivator and lead to greater efficiency in both Industry and Labor).

There are two basic reasons why we see Fascism as a product of Capitalism. The most obvious was Soviet propaganda which portrayed Fascism as a more extreme form of Capitalism; and another was Mussolini's own propaganda. Before Mussolini was able to completely incorporate Corporatism into the Italian government, the Fascist state began to collapse. Mussolini began a worldwide propaganda campaign to acquire loans from foreign governments and foreign Industrialists/Bankers. The basic premise of his propaganda was that the Fascist Corporate State stabilized Italy for investment (the exact opposite was true). One of the other major points of his propaganda was that Fascism crushed Bolshevism in Europe (a complete lie). This myth alone brought great acclaim from Rightists and Reactionaries in many countries and lead to the creation of many far-right Fascist groups.

The end result of all of this were two forms of Fascism. The far-right, anti-Communist, pro-Capitalist, bastardized form of Fascism; and the far-left, Corporate State, anti-Capitalist form of Fascism.

The far-right Fascism was admired by politicians like Winston Churchill and industrialists like the duPonts and Pews.

The far-left Fascism was admired by people like Franklin Roosevelt and John Maynard Keynes.",,False,,t5_2sfmf,False,,,True,t3_t5mhu,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/t5mhu/there_is_something_vastly_wrong_with_peoples/,

1361277119.0,97,self.PoliticalDiscussion,18tced,"Why is there a stigma surrounding the term ""Socialism"".",151,54,760,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/18tced/why_is_there_a_stigma_surrounding_the_term/,"Hi Guys, never posted on this sub before so please forgive me in advance if I am wronging some kind of unspecified etiquette. 

I am a normal person. I have, throughout most of my life, been politically neutral.  That was until I was forced (through university accomodation) to live with a socialist.  At first, I was as sceptical as anyone would be  - positing the argument that, even if Socialism might be idyllic (this point, by the way, was not conceded easily - it took a lot of debate and discussion, but I do agree with the sentiment now) it is in no way faesible.  Now, however, I feel as though, irrespective of how realistic a socialist society might be, it should be something we strive for.  

Now, for me, socialism is defined by the belief that capatalism, as a system, is inherently flawed, and is to blame for the economic inequality that the world suffers.  It is essentially the belief that as the workers generate the world's wealth, they should own the means of production.  The only way this is possible is through an overthrow of the current system, by means of a revolution, rather then to work with the system we currently have (because it is inherently flawed).  

This, of course, comes with other beliefs that I also subscribe to.  For example, I believe that in order to maintain itself effectively, capatalism seeks to create divides amongst workers.  For example, a capatalist controlled media might moan about immigrants claiming benefits from the government (with a headline like ""We're paying taxes for these louts to live a life of luxury!"") - as such, we attribute our economic woes on illegal immigrants, rather then things like war and austerity.  That's an example, but I think, subtly, capatalism is the source of every form of discrimination - gender, race, sexuality etc. Historically, every form of discrimination has had a desire for money at the heart of it.

I don't want to get into an argument about the details of socialism, or even whether or not human nature is compatible with such a belief (I know there is a lot of debate over this and that's fair enough).  But what I do want to discuss is why, when I tell people I'm a socialist, they cringe in a way I imagine I would if someone told me they were a neo nazi.  Socialism seeks to explain the world - why is it that the top 100 richest people in the world earn more then the bottom 50%? Why do we overproduce food in some countries when there are people dieing of starvation a few hours plane journey away? There seem to be too many irrationalities, too many wars, too much hate. I don't want to sound too ""60's"" - but seriously, are Socialists really that bad for wanting to change things? 

Any opinion would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

TL;DR: Socialism doesn't seem so bad compared to the world we currently live in, so why do people treat it like the plague?

EDIT: Just want to tip my hat to those that have commented so far. I hope I have returned the same level of respect as has been shown. Apologies in advance if I have come across as rude or brief - but I'm trying to discuss as many things as I can. It's been really useful for me and I'll definitely be using this sub again. There aren't many places online where you can have this kind of discussion without me being called a nazi (which has only been implied once) so, kudos.

While I agree with almost all of the LP's views on social issue, I cannot see any chance of voting for them based on their platforms for education and the governments role in big business. Specifically, I would like someone to explain to me how the free-market system is supposed to provide better education for everyone, and how free market will bring COG down for vital necessities like power, gasoline, etc. 

When the power companies were privatized under Clinton, it was sold to the american people as a cost saving measure, that would drop everybody's bill by lowering energy rates. This was a falsehood. If we expand this strategy to the few vital industries that are still well regulated (i know a lot of you will take exception to ""well"", but bear with me""), how can we honestly expect a different result?

As far as education goes, applying a free market model to the education system will lead to a society where education is only available to a few rich elite. There would be no incentive for anyone to go to poor, rural, or inner city schools at any level because they won't have the money to pay teachers in competition with districts peopled by more affluent families. The children from the under-privileged districts would not have the means to transfer to a better district, or the money to pay for it, so they would be relegated to shitty schools. This in turn would relegate them to little or no college, low paying jobs, keeping them in the areas they grew up in (or an area similar), and thus dooming their children to the same fate.

Again, I am not trolling, but I have never had an intelligent discussion with someone who could rebut this with logic and evidence (not just screaming and Ron Paul posts...)

It distorts the reality of the situation and makes it impossible to deal with tendencies. If 90% of a group adheres to a certain belief, it is absolutely fair to say that group holds that belief.

What happened at Sandy Hook was a tragedy. 20 children were killed, along with 8 faculty members who were heroically trying to defend them. Our society lost the contributions that these 28 people would make in their future. This was the act of a mentally ill young man, and should have little bearing on the rights of mentally competent, legal  gun owners. Instead we should focus on promoting mental healthcare and breaking down the stigmas that prevent people from seeking treatment for themselves and their children when they need it.

A frustrating portion of the current gun control arguments blazing across the internet are blatantly fear-mongering and uniformed. Everywhere from tweets to news articles from legitimate outlets I’m seeing the buzzwords of [“violent video games”](http://spectator.org/archives/2012/12/17/god-help-us), “assault rifles”, “military style weapons”,  along with people saying highly educated things like [“look at that gun, do you think it should be outlawed?”](http://www.planetside-universe.com/showpost.php?s=af0b1bc5ec360e9007cc78b4df8d95b9&amp;p=804102&amp;postcount=184). Perhaps the greatest offender is [“High velocity rounds”](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/16/school-shooter-adam-lanza_n_2312818.html). The nature of all bullets is that they travel at high velocities so they can hit something and transfer lethal force before gravity pulls them to the ground. This phase is a meaningless attempt to promote fear.  The pictures you find of rifles in these news articles are not base model weapons, [but those kitted out with tons of aftermarket add-ons that make the guns look big and “aggressive”](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/politics/121217/sandy-hook-newtown-shooting-gun-control-australia-scotland-finland-changed-gun-laws-after-shooting). People are calling to reinstate the assault weapons ban, which does little but ban “scary looking” guns. In reality, this would have not applied to the weapon used in the school shooting in Connecticut. And overall, [violent crime is at its lowest rate since 1963](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2012/0109/US-crime-rate-at-lowest-point-in-decades.-Why-America-is-safer-now), even though we have been WITHOUT a national assault weapons ban for 8 years and [gun ownership has been increasing](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/18/gun-ownership-up-crime-down/). 

I have heard a lot of calls for “increased” or “reasonable” gun control, but these terms are very vague. And when I specific hear suggestions, they almost always come from someone who seems to know little of guns or responsible gun culture. Let me address some of the common arguments and ideas I’m hearing:

**It’s about the Children/If one Child is killed, guns should be banned:** Don’t you even dare. [168 children have been killed in drone strikes in the last 7 years](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8695679/168-children-killed-in-drone-strikes-in-Pakistan-since-start-of-campaign.html). This is on par with the annual average number of deaths in US school shootings even without taking into account the number of innocent adults. [Especially when our government counts all men killed as militants to keep civilian deaths low](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=4&amp;_r=2). Where is your outrage for the children on this? Are these foreign children not worth protecting?

To address a less extreme statistic, [113 students died playing football between 1998 and 2007] (http://www.unc.edu/depts/nccsi/FootballInjuryData.htm), not counting the numbers from baseball, basketball, or the much under rated, yet difficult [cheerleading](http://www.mahalo.com/lauren-chang/). Yet we allow sports in school, why? Because the advantages outweigh the risks. Just like guns. 

**I don’t know why people should own guns**:  Just small reasons, like self-defense, hunting, defense from excesses of government (Please see below),and the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. But let’s be more specific. Guns are force equalizers. You may have heard the quote ""God Made Man, but Samuel Colt Made Them Equal"". For much of human history, power derived directly from strength.  The man who could swing the largest or fastest sword, the man who could draw the biggest bow (and underrated feat of strength), these were the men that either had power or were used to keep the power of others. Then guns come along. Suddenly, a [older woman](http://www2.tbo.com/news/central-tampa/2008/oct/24/clair-mel-city-woman-kills-home-invader-deputies-s-ar-106921/) is no longer at the mercy of large brutes, a [wheelchair bound man](http://www.examiner.com/article/disabled-former-marine-fends-off-3-home-invaders) can fend off multiple home invaders, or a [12 year old girl](http://townhall.com/columnists/celiabigelow/2012/10/20/12yearold_defends_herself_with_gun_proves_need_of_2nd_amendment/page/full/) can stop an assailant. Taking away guns would put the physically powerful at an advantage. 

**People don’t need Assault Rifles/Assault Weapons:** First of all, if it’s not a weapon with selective fire (single, burst, auto) AND is shoulder-fired AND fires an intermediate round (between pistol and rifle calibers) it’s not an assault rifle. Similarly, the term “assault weapon” is a legal definition in a few states such as California and New York that covers weapons bearing a certain number of modifications, such as pistol grips, bayonet lugs, or the [ever so deadly barrel shrouds]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U32GOlL5Ro4). That said, very few Civilians in the country can access actual assault rifles, and the modifications made to assault weapons are generally made for increased comfort in shooting, adding a little bit of “cool factor”, or increasing weapon versatility. They DO NOT make the rounds fired from the weapon more lethal the rounds fired from another weapon. For example adding a scope, flash suppressor, and a pistol grip does not enable people to become unlocatable snipers able to shoot flies out of the air and a distance of 1,000 yards. I’m having trouble in finding the number of bayonet killings in the country in the last few decades, but I assure you that a makeshift spear proven effective by the British as late as 2006, is less of a threat than a loaded gun. [Studies have shown that the assault weapons ban had no statistically significant impact on violent crime, and that weapons covered under the ban were only rarely used in crimes (approx. 2%)](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/research/aw_final2004.pdf). The same studies showed the ineffectiveness of limiting magazine capacity. 

**No Military style guns:** This ties in with the above statement. The similarity of civilian small arms to military hardware is a feature of technological advancement. Once muzzle loading and then bolt action rifles were “military style”. Modern weapons are safer, more reliable, and more accurate. Someone defending themselves is more likely to be successful, and less likely to hurt a bystander with a modern weapon. Military Style weapons may be used to refer to Fully Automatic weapons, also known as machine guns, which are able to fire continuously with a single trigger pull. Any arguments calling out fully automatic weapons are a clear sign of ignorance. Civilians can’t own fully automatic weapons without a $200 permit and an extensive background check. Even then, civilians can only buy fully automatic weapons made before 1986, which means the number of weapons available is fixed and prohibitively expensive (on the order $20,000+). Even so, [there have only been two homicides from legally owned machine guns since 1934]( http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcfullau.html). Illegal machine guns are more often seen in gang crime, but account for less than 1% of confiscated gang weapons. 

**I don’t know why anybody would need semi-automatic guns:** Guns don’t make a small click like the trigger on a video game controller. You are holding a device in your hands that contains and directs a small explosion. Even firing a gun in a safe gun range with hearing protection will increase the heart rate and adrenaline output of most shooters. Now add the stress of being awoken in the night by someone breaking into your house. I hope you have nerves of steel and a steady hand, because if you miss with a gun you have to reload every time, you’re screwed. This is also why magazine capacity should not be arbitrarily limited. Ah, but what about revolvers? Well, I hope you are not attacked by more than 6 assailants and/or don’t miss a single time. And revolving chambers are not practical for hunting rifles. The combination of high powered rounds and unsealed chambers reduce weapon effectiveness and can lead to user injury.  This means hunters would have to use bolt-action/lever action weapons or reload after every shot. These delays in a follow up shot means injured game has a chance to escape, resulting in increased suffering of the animal as it slowly bleeds out and less food on the table for those that depend on hunting. Additionally, the detachable magazines common to semi-automatics are lauded by hunters for their convenience and safety when performing activities that are best done with an unloaded rifle, such as climbing over fences or racking your weapon in your car for transport. 

**Guns should be kept unloaded, trigger locked, and in a safe at all times**: I hear this argument quite often, and it is perhaps the most ridiculous. In a defense situation, you are not going to have time to run to your safe, remember the combination under stress, unlock the trigger lock on your gun, load it, and then bring it to bear on the attacker. [Trigger locks are especially useless, or even dangerous]( http://hematite.com/dragon/gctriglock.html). The only time weapons should be unloaded and stored is if you are not at home, to prevent access by curious children or thieves looking for a gun unconnected to them. This practice is made simpler with the detachable box magazine common to semi-automatics. If the practice of single sign on verification in computer security teaches us anything, it’s that simpler security practices are more likely to be followed. But as with my link above about the 12 year old girl who was able to defend herself with a gun when home alone, you should also educate your children on the lethal seriousness of guns you own and smash any delusions they may have about guns being “cool”. 

**Guns Defend Against Tyranny? Good luck shooting your pistols at Tanks and Cruise Missiles:** Anyone who talks about overthrowing the military and government by force of arms is likely not living in reality. If our society ever devolved to the point of near post-apocalyptic decay, or fell under sway of brutal tyrants, then perhaps such means may be justified. But these scenarios are extemely unlikely and this is not the best way for an armed populace to stop a government from overstepping their bounds.  The point of leaving the citizenry their weapons is that of a deterrent. It would simply be too costly to crush an armed population in government oppression. Look at the difficulty the militaries of multiple countries have faced in Afghanistan over the years. If you cut out deaths caused by RPGs, they have still taken quite a toll with improvised explosive devices and small arms. The United States has 10 times the population of Afghanistan. Any suppression activities carried out by our military are going to be long, bloody, and costly urban warfare for the most part (even assuming 100% loyalty of the armed forces in killing our own civilians). Although, if it ever came to the point where our citizenry were embattled against our own military, the United States would be done as we know it. 

So what are reasonable gun controls to me?

**Uniform implementation of controls that are already in effect in some states:** Background checks, waiting periods, restrictions to convicts.

**Training:** I think gun owners should be required to attend an affordable, but thorough training course and made to witness the results of gun injury and death. These are not toys, but tools that can both save lives and take them.

**Mental Health Screenings:** I would be open to hearing suggestions on the best way to implement mental health screenings for gun purchases. I realize that it wouldn't have helped in this case, but it would help in others. Either way, mental healthcare needs an investment. 

**TL,DR: But look at my loving, painstaking formatting, plentiful links, and use of Bolding!**

In summary, the entire would experienced violence, crime, rape, and murder well before guns were invented. Our society is becoming more peaceful, but responding to tragedy with unreasonable new laws is not the answer to maintain that safety. I welcome an informed discussion on gun control based on logic, not emotion. Let’s all please do our research, have a friendly discussion, and together figure out the best way forward.

Now, more than likely if you're my friend, you're probably not conservative. For those of you who are, that's cool too. Go vote.
As a non-conservative Texan, you're probably thinking...what's the point? Well, most political analysts believe Texas is on it's way to being a swing state, could be as early as 2016. aka, one election away
Mind blown again? Lets keep it moving.

Let's say you wanted to vote for Obama. He won't win Texas, but you know what a vote for him does? It says there is a person, of your age group, in your zip code that WANTED him to win the state, and be our president.
How about Ron Paul? No, he won't win. But it says there is someone in your age group, in your tax bracket, in your zip code that WANTS their voice to be heard.
How about MACHOMAN Randy Savage? Well, you know what that does, it gives you a voice.

Now you're probably still thinking, ok, so wtf is the point then.
The POINT is, it shows that there is someone who GIVE A SHIT. It means you're still listening. It means you WANT people to hear your voice, and THAT, is powerful.

Now, if you are an activist, going out knocking on doors, handing out pamphlets, living your daily life pushing for an alternative political/monetary system, then seriously....bravo to you. Please, keep doing that. I believe in an America free of our broken system as well.

That's what's wrong with this country. You respect your damn president whether he's a Democrat or a Republican. What he's saying is that he does not support the country he lives in unless the leader is from the Tea Party. That's just ridiculous.

""America is getting soft."" What do you mean? ""Well, you're not allowed to discipline anymore. When I joined the Army, there was this lieutenant in basic training that everyone hated. He was the meanest S.O.B. I ever did meet. On the last day of training he told us, 'I know many of you hate my guts right now and rightfully so. But what I have done for you will help you in combat someday. If just one of you survives because of what I have taught you, I have done my job well.' That changed me. I am forever grateful for that man and everything he did for me. Now, you can't say one thing to a kid without being insensitive. I hope this doesn't become our greatest flaw.""

The only difference between typical self-defense laws and the ""stand your ground law"" is that in a typical self defense trial, the defendant has a responsibility to show that he/she was unable to retreat before resorting to force in order to defend him/herself whereas under the ""stand your ground laws"", a defend has no such responsibility. Incidentally, these laws were originally instituted to defend victims who had used deadly force when they could have instead retreated because they were not originally in a sound enough state of mind to realize that there was another option.

In the case of George Zimmerman, the defense's narrative timeline had Zimmerman on the ground, mounted by Trayvon Martin for 30-40 seconds before he resorted to using his gun to defend himself. This means that when the gun was used, he was unable to retreat and therefore he would have been acquitted whether or not Florida had ""stand your ground"" laws instituted at the time.

Just so no one is confused, I am not trying to defend Zimmerman's actions, defend the jury's verdict, or defame Trayvon Martin. I just want to ensure that as many people as possible on this subreddit can have an intelligent discussion about the ""stand your ground"" laws and what part they played in the Zimmerman trial

Thank you very much for taking the time to read and consider my points.

TL;DR: The stand your ground laws played no part in Zimmerman's defense because according to the defense's narrative, he was unable to retreat at the time of firing his weapon.

Edit: Some knowledgeable redditors have brought it to my attention that SYG may have affected the outcome of the trial, because it was cited as part of the reason that Zimmerman was not originally detained, and it was also referenced as part of the jury's instructions during their deliberation. 

That being said, I would like to clarify that I started this thread to show that the defense's narrative is just as solid under the SYG and it would be using more traditional definitions of acceptable self defense. Therefore it is my own belief that this case should not be politicized in an attempt to repeal or revise SYG laws.

1374006797.0,95,self.PoliticalDiscussion,1ifrw2,My personal experience with online surveillance,119,24,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ifrw2/my_personal_experience_with_online_surveillance/,"Hello all! 

I thought this story should be heard. /r/politics and /r/technology don't allow self posts, so maybe you guys will appreciate it. I welcome suggestions of a more appropriate subreddit as well. 

This all started with my teenage sister, who we will call Anna. Anna lives away from home at a boarding school. She was having some vaginal discomfort, and was concerned that she might have a yeast infection. So, who does a teenage girl turn to for guidance? Her mom who coincidentally has connections to the medical field. 

Anna sent mom a private message on Facebook describing the discomfort she had been having. They talked back and forth (in a text-based and obviously nonsexual manner) trying to 'troubleshoot', so to speak. Anna mentioned itchiness, and so mom thought it might be a rash. 

At the same time, one of mom's friends who we will call Mary, had a rash develop on her arm. She had sent a picture of that to my mom. Mary is 40. A picture of an arm. A 40 year old's arm. 

Mom sent a picture of the rash to Anna and asked her if the irritated region looked similar. Let me emphasize here that **there is only one picture that had been exchanged, and it is of a 40 year old woman who is fully dressed.**

So imagine my poor mother's surprise when she is woken up one morning to a Florida police officer knocking on her door. She nearly faints when she is told she is wanted for mandatory questioning on child pornography charges.

They had an entire dossier on her. Drivers license and birth certificates, photocopies of all of her facebook private messages (even unrelated ones), all sorts of information. Now, obviously it wasn't difficult to explain everything away given that it was transparently obvious that my mother is not a child pornographer. But what concerned me is the police officer mentioned some organization that Facebook and Google cooperates with that can sift through our supposedly private communications for illegal activity and share those communications with local law enforcement. 

There is a certain expectation of privacy in our online communications, and we shouldn't live in fear of being accosted by the police randomly on such heavy charges as child pornography. And some third party organization shouldn't be privy to our personal info under the guise of 'protecting the children'. 

I asked my mom to Freedom of Information her dossier and get the name of the organization, but she refused. She told me in tears that she just wants the whole thing to be over. Her facebook account was suspended for a few weeks but then they gave it back to her. We're not sure if the investigation is officially over, but it looks like not much will come of it. 

**TL;DR My mom got in trouble for sharing a picture of a 40 year old's arm with her daughter over private channels.**",,False,,t5_2sfmf,False,,,True,t3_1ifrw2,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ifrw2/my_personal_experience_with_online_surveillance/,

No one is surprised if they send emails about how their grill broke and suddenly there's advertisements for grills.  What if, instead, you're watching youtube videos of beheadings in Pakistan and searching for pressure cookers and fertilizer?  Should the government really not be able to access that information when Williams-Sonoma can access our information about grills?  

The answer might be that no, the government should not, but the issue is far more complicated than reddit would make it seem.

**EDIT**:  The overarching point of the article isn't that we should be totally fine with the government accessing this info, its that without any meaningful legal control over what corporations can access blocking government access is an absurdity.  The article's closing paragraph:

I want to say something about the Chik Fil A thing going on right now. First of all, I’m kind of lazy about boycotts. I can respect someone who doesn’t want to get political in their food choices, or who frequents a particular business because they’re affordable, or convenient, or whatever.

What I’m concerned with today are the people who are at Chik Fil A today, out of some misguided belief that someone is infringing on the owner’s freedom of speech. This is NOT a free speech issue. Nobody is arresting the dude. Nobody is asking the government to shut his business down. Nobody is trying to prevent him from expressing his views. Furthermore, for most people, this boycott is not about speech. It’s about the donations he makes with Chik Fil A profits to hate groups, and people who don’t want their money feeding those profits.

When you purposefully visit Chik Fil A today, and brag about it, you’re not protecting Cathy’s freedom of speech, because his freedom of speech is not being threatened. What you are doing is actively supporting his bigotry. You’re purposefully and intentionally giving the company money, a portion of which will be donated to known hate groups. Would you go out of your way to intentionally support a business that openly contributed to the KKK?

Furthermore, for those of you posting these photos who supposedly have no issue with gay people - have you considered the impact of these photos on your friends? Have you considered the amount of emotional turmoil the average gay person has already experienced, coming to terms with their sexuality in a world that considers him a second class citizen? Have you considered, then, how it feels for that person to open up Facebook and see that someone they thought was a friend is out, right that minute, supporting anti-gay bigotry, and bragging about it on their newsfeed?

As a bisexual with a number of gay friends, I don’t have room in my life for bigots who try to disguise their bigotry as a free speech issue. I also don’t have room in my life for people who opt to follow the conservative thought police paranoia without putting any thought into what their actions really mean. I’m pretty sure most of my friends are intelligent people, who put thought into their actions and political beliefs, and I’m hoping that none of my Facebook friends are bigots, but I’ve already been surprised once today. Free speech is great. So is the free market.

There may be very a very good reason for this type of union.  For a three person union, you can have two breadwinners while one stays home with the child.  There is also more redundancy.

I am not interested in engaging in backhanded insults or personal attacks, but I would like to learn in some intellectual discourse what is so special about 2 people?  In my estimation, gay marriage proponents are going to have to articulate those reasons if a court challenge comes on equal protection grounds by a polygamous couple in one of the 10 states that allow for gay marriage.

Is an effective campaign finance reform even *realistically* possible today?,127,36,304,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1jeea8/im_absolutely_convinced_that_a_majority_of_our/,"I believe it's the biggest issue in America today, yet many aren't even aware of why. There are many issues facing America today where both sides try to take a different approach to solving: for instance, dems will say that more and more Americans are falling behind, so we need more social programs to help them up (subsequently spending more federal money), while Republicans argue that these are handouts, making people lazy, not willing to work for an honest wage. Both solutions to me are treating a symptom, not the disease -- in the end, completely ineffective. 

Today we have a number of issues, social mobility at an all time low, money leaving the middle class to the 1%, decreasing purchasing power by the average citizen, lack of accessible healthcare, massive debt, low education, high crime, losing credibility, fickle economy, oligopolies, and so on... Politicians, everyday, try to tackle these problems one at a time, usually by claiming their political ideology will fix the problem. 

However, at the end of the day, they ALL root from one thing: Big money, corporate/special interests, money in politics. They've managed to rig the game as to where if you want to be elected, you NEED to accept their money. If you don't, they'll give it to the next guy who will pummel you in the elections off sheer financial might. It's become necessary to accept big money to remain competitive -- subsequently resulting in politicians acting firstly in the best will of their large donors before the people. It's not that the representatives are evil, it's just that they are forced to play a terrible game. 

The obvious results are all the above. The big money has managed to create an economy that overly regulates small business, making entry expensive, and passed other non-competitive regulation to prevent competition from entering their market. They've rigged the economy to work in their favor and against any competitor. 

If we sole this issue of money in politics, politicians will no longer have to worry about getting reelected off the backs of big interests, but by doing objectively good things. Once the economy starts to correct itself, after a truly competitive marketplace returns, issues like low wages, not being able to afford healthcare, widening social gaps, unemployment, and so on, will no longer be issues. Today the government spends tons on social programs to treat the symptoms of a sick economy. If we actually treat the disease, there would be no need to treat these symptoms.

However, to this day, this is one of the few things I feel extremely pessimistic about. I don't see a reasonable way in which we can get out of this. Congress certainly isn't going to want to cut off the hand that feeds and is lining their pockets as post congressional lobbyists. Nor will we likely ever get a true visionary leader, as the primaries are by and large decided by big money, leaving the common person to decide between one of the two people who are essentially supporting of big money...

Is there a way out of this? I honestly believe, at my core, THIS is the biggest issue facing America today, and would radically transform America tremendously in a positive manner if we could figure out a way to get big money and special interests in general out of politics.

Thoughts?

I forget the name of the guy who said it, but I think its a surprisingly accurate term for what's been happening in the US for the past 20 years or so. 

Its built up slowly after the Reagan era, going from the usual rivalry between Democrat and Republican into an all-out cultural, social, and political conflict with no quarter given for control of the country.  Republicans had an early advantage, as the Democrats in the 90s didn't seem to realize the degree to which the right was polarizing, but during the Bush presidency they got themselves better organized and are pushing back just as hard now.

Any hope for any real bipartisanship has completely evaporated, imho, as both sides are entrenched like the combatants in WWI, with what little ground given in one month is just taken back again the next, in a never ending cycle of attrition.  There seems little way out until one side manages to permanently cripple the other, and just like in the real Civil War 150 years ago, whichever sides wins may have to end up destroying half the country in order to do so.

Third parties in this environment are doomed from the get-go.  Both sides are far too invested in the conflict now to tolerate any distractions or, worse yet, vote-drainers.  Look at Ron Paul and his constituency over the Republican primary season.  The GOP and Fox News didn't even want to acknowledge that he was running or that any follwoing he had even existed.

This coming election will only be one battle.  I think it should be obvious now that whichever side loses will just galvanize that much harder against the winner.  Whether you're choosing a side or just digging in to ride it out, I think we have to acknowledge at this point that the conflict is going to go for quite some time to come.

1374172221.0,84,self.PoliticalDiscussion,1ikq4m,"My essay about why Rolling Stone's Tsarnaev Cover symbolizes so much about why America is fucked up. (Very long, but hopefully worth the read.)",144,60,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ikq4m/my_essay_about_why_rolling_stones_tsarnaev_cover/,"**Rolling Stone's Tsarnaev Cover Is Much More Clever Than You Realize: It's About Freedom of Speech**

Yesterday the internet pretty much exploded in rage about the Rolling Stone cover of Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the suspected Boston Bomber. To recap the controversy, when the cover was announced, CVS and another native local grocery store flat out said they won’t stock that issue of the magazine. The mayor of Boston said he was outraged. The Boston Globe said the magazine was an ""act of irresponsibility."" 

I support their choice on the cover. In fact, I’ll go further: I feel it’s brilliantly executed. It’s a reminder, and a good one, that wolves like Tsarnaev often wear sheep’s clothing. And that reminder, in and of itself, is immensely valuable. 

I feel this cover is deeply misunderstood. People saw Rolling Stone's cover, made a knee-jerk reaction, and let their emotions take over. The rage over the article isn’t really about his appearance. It’s about a deep seated, psychological reaction to it, which bears much closer examination.

A bomber can dress just like a rock star and blend in to the crowd and he doesn't have to look like a hideous monster, although that’s what we’d like to believe, because it’s so much more comfortable. I think many more people would prefer for him to look like a monster because he would be easier to identify that way. It wasn’t uncomfortable for us to see James Holmes appear in court with his flaming red hair and staring, thousand yard stare; there was so clearly something deeply wrong with him. Mental illness is disturbing by nature.

But Tsarnaev? He blends in. And that’s why so many people are outraged by that cover, although they’re having trouble articulating it. Rolling Stone, in choosing that picture, is deeply disturbing us, but they've chosen to do it on purpose. They are doing it because they’re showing us that anyone, from the kid next door you hire to mow your lawn, to the kid who takes your movie tickets next time you catch an afternoon showing, could be planning something nefarious.

But look at little closer. The outrage people feel from looking at that cover isn't coming from Rolling Stone. Deep down, it isn’t Rolling Stone that’s done anything shocking or outrageous by publishing a picture that shows Dzokhar Tsarnaev in a disheveled, unkempt pose, similar to one a rock-star might choose. The words they put beside the photo are entirely appropriate. They labeled him “The Bomber.”  The outrage that so many people are feeling from viewing that cover springs from the deep discomfort they feel on looking at it because it comes along subconsciously, with a psychological disconnect. *For good reason, too: just how do you identify a psychopath when he looks just like the very attractive kid next door?*

As a species, we are biased towards the attractive. We don’t like to admit this, but it’s true. We are oriented towards the young, the beautiful. Entire magazines, huge advertising budgets exist to capture, to exploit this tendency of ours. It’s a huge part of our psychological makeup. As a result, we can’t help but feel that attractive people don’t do hideous things.  Our conscious mind may tell us that Tsarnaev bombed the marathon but something in the subconscious is willing to contradict that, because of that pre-programmed bias. And that irritates us, most of us, anyway. We know what he’s done. It’s a human exploit, a hack into our vanity. We don’t want to admit this fact, but it is true.  You've been mind hacked when you look at that Rolling Stone cover, and you don't like it. 

To look at that photo, subconsciously the viewer has to confront the fact that there’s something deeply, fundamentally wrong about some young, immensely attractive teenager who allegedly, premeditatedly bombed a marathon, killing several Americans and permanently maiming and wounding scores more. Looking at that picture of Tsarnaev, is to simultaneously contemplate the bombings and to realize the baby-faced teenager on the cover was responsible, but also to have to deal with the psychological disconnect that someone so attractive would do such a horrible thing. And then, perhaps, for you, as for me, memories of the photos of the victims pop up in the mind; blood rushing down their faces, as they were rushed to the hospital. You think of the lost limbs, the hours spent in reconstructive surgery, perhaps their new lives in wheelchairs. Irreversible nerve pain. Their lives will never be the same. It’s difficult not to feel a fundamental need for retributive action. But when we look for someone to blame, we look for a reason, we look for a ‘bad guy,’ and we see an image that doesn't quite fit the bill. In fact, the image Rolling Stone presents us is so far off the mark as to be ludicrous in its complete and utter disparity from what we feel a bomber ‘should’ look like. 

But this is exactly why a truthful picture is needed. America is at a fundamental junction in history. We’re sheering off into factions, at times, seeming to sheer off into red and blue, with a rift that seems to be growing year by year. We have a failing educational system, starting with day-care, which many working parents are struggling to even afford, all the way up to college, where the tuition rates for students at even in-state colleges are sky-rocketing, and many students are graduating from 4 year institutions with such a massive debt load that it may take as many as 25 or 30 years for them to fully pay back all of their debt. Some, in fact, may never manage it. Because the debt cannot be discharged through bankruptcy, even in cases of disability, it’s been compared to a system of indentured servitude. We’re struggling to educate in general, but during the process of education, across the board, we’re failing to teach students the fundamental skill of critical thinking, which used to be the foundational bedrock of the educational system itself, and which was what was hammered into our educational system 75 years ago. It’s what set us apart as a world leader in science and technology, and frankly, it’s where we are now falling down.

Because we now have knee-jerk reactions, we attempt to censor the press, we don't want to talk through or think of the implications of what censoring the press would actually do. People are actually advocating pulling (and have pulled) this magazine from store shelves? Because they are threatened by Tsarnaev's appearance? The absurdity of this is flooring. It feels remarkably like a throwback to the book 1984 by George Orwell, when books, magazines, and all media needed to be altered by the state to fit what the state found ""currently acceptable.""  Tsarnaev's appearance is not currently acceptable. Hence, censored.

We no longer think critically, as a society. We look at a magazine cover and have a collective knee-jerk reaction which results in a mayor of a city and the heads of corporations yanking a magazine from their shelves based on the cover, without reading the article and evaluating its contents. We are no longer able to see a magazine cover and understand that an image may challenge our pre-conceived beliefs of what ‘a terrorist’ might look like; that he may look young and handsome and yes, he may resemble a rock star, but that that fact is not a reason to ban the magazine, or to ask Rolling Stone to change the cover. Such a reaction is the reaction of a repressive, close-minded state, one that does not understand critical thinking or its role in education. Flexibility, intelligence, and capacity to interpret threats as they evolve is crucial to understanding and evolving a stronger defense as a nation, not a knee-jerk reaction to what makes you feel scared and threatened. Because in the end, this is what makes the terrorists stronger; they learn that what they really need to recruit is attractive, young terrorists. 

Next time we as a nation feel threatened, we need to stop playing it easy. We need to stop going the easy route, the lazy route, the expensive route. This has been our modus operandi for so long. This is our post 9/11, fear operated world.

 We need to stop installing inefficient, TSA scanners at every airport, which don’t actually find anything other than grandmothers and people in wheelchairs and little 3 year olds with favorite toys which the TSA takes delight in removing and breaking. We need to start thinking with intelligence about how threats evolve, how best to meet them and how it can be done simply, cheaply, and without invasion of privacy of individuals. The NSA’s surveillance of every individual in the USA is an outrage that we should not be standing for, because it doesn’t actually yield effective results. If it did, wouldn’t Tsarnaev and his brother have been caught before the Boston bombings actually happened? He wasn’t tech savvy. He was a dumb kid. If the NSA couldn’t catch him when they have surveillance on every individual in America, what does that say about the effectiveness of their programs? But then again we are standing for whatever the NSA says because nobody is thinking it through; critical thinking has come to a complete standstill in America, if it is not actually sliding backwards at this point. 

It is a hallmark of a totalitarian state to attempt to alter, remove, or edit information that is challenging or doesn’t fit the state’s portrayal of how they feel a suspect should be portrayed through the media. On the other hand, it is a hallmark of a free and open society, such as a democracy, that a healthy debate takes place through the press and allows challenging information, while it may be upsetting to some, to form a complex, shifting picture, composed of many hundreds of puzzle pieces, in the reconstruction of an individual’s prior life, history, motives, and what may have inspired him or her to commit such a horrible crime. Crime is a complex subject, as is psychology, and it is also an upsetting one. The two are intertwined, and since we can never truly enter the mind of another human being, many of the puzzle pieces will be forever lost. The best we can do at sorting out the motives of a crime is to read and consider, with an open mind, as many well thought out and perhaps challenging yet difficult pieces to be published. This means cherishing the fundamentals of our democracy, and perhaps the most important piece of all: the right and the responsibility of every citizen to continue thinking critically, and to challenge subconscious bias.

Thus, the general population, unable to control government actions, usually cannot be held responsible for them. Assuming the United States is democratic, and the government represents the will of the people, the numerous questionable policies United States conducted throughout history, one would expect, were supported by the majority of American citizens. Whether you voted for Bush or Obama, there are plenty of examples of rights abuses and foreign military involvement under either administration. I focus on foreign policy because every nation, I think, has the right to sovereign decision-making within its own borders, so if people choose to make questionable domestic policy, it is their own business. However, when people in a nation elect to intervene into the business of another,  the international community has the right to judge them as harshly as they see fit. 

To reiterate, if you voted Republican or Democrat, do you take responsibility for the actions of that party? Or is the freedom actually quite limited, and you end up trapped in a bipartisan system, voting for the lesser evil, rather than what you truly believe in? If so, why do you think is the lack of powerful political alternatives in America not a hugely debated issue?

Edit: Thank you for the responses, certainly is an interesting read about a serious issue. It seems that many have assumed that I am foreign, so perhaps this is somewhat of a twist, but I am a US citizen. I voted for Obama twice. Am I partially responsible for drone strikes, Guantanamo, and other foreign interventions and issues? Absolutely. But I guess I'm not good enough of a person to care. I wish all nations had the geopolitical ambitions of Switzerland, but unfortunately, it seems the more powerful a nation, the more problem it has minding it's own business. I take that as a fact, and see the rights abuses as one of those special things I take part in by being a US citizen. Someday, when the US is no longer the dominant power, perhaps it will once again focus on domestic issues. If there wasn't a risk that the greater of two evils gets elected, I would certainly vote 3rd party, but realistically it seems that we are trapped in the bipartisan system. Ranked voting system sounds like something that could help fix this, but in a country that still uses the electoral college, would that ever really come about? It's sad to see so many disillusioned people, but at least many still care. Perhaps there is still hope.

---

**Warning:** *Strongly condensed.*

---

**How I entered libertarianism:**

I was young and I was relatively politically inexperienced. I entered libertarianism from a social libertarian way through social media sites like Digg. Mainly it was thanks due to the horrors about the drug war and gun control I picked up from them while I was a social liberal. I reaffirmed my strong atheist position like about 2 or 3 years before Barack Obama was elected. I was sort of your stereotypical /r/atheist user who is obsessed with Scandinavian liberalism, and as a result, I really admired the liberalism of Europe.

After Barack Obama wasn't as good was I hoped he was in 2009, I started dabbling in libertarian online media where I picked up information from various libertarian forums and sites like the CATO institute, Freedom-to-Choose from Milton Friedman, John Stossel's Shows, and Penn and Teller's TV show called ""Bullshit.""

I thought: ""Wow, freedom and the markets are really efficient. If we had more economic and social freedom, we would be so much happier and wealthier."" And so I eventually perused more libertarian media which led me to developing a sort of dogmatism for freedom and economic efficiency, and viewing things from an austro-libertarian lense. It also led me to view economics in a sort of Austrian, rational, and absolute sense with no outside forces.

Eventually me interacting with these people led me to interacting with minarchists and anarcho-capitalists. I developed a sort of individualistic philosophy where only the individual mattered, ""collectivists"" could go fuck off, force was immoral (adopting a vague non-aggression principle ideology), the market could provide what the state provided with voluntary interactions, and that the state always screws and distorts the market creating inefficiencies with waste. It was a really dogmatic experience in general.

**TL;DR:** *Naive, young, staunch moralistic dogma.*

---

**How I left libertarianism:**

At first it was me transitioning into moral nihilism. Where I rejected natural rights and realized that everything moral was subjective and did not exist. I still sorta do, but this moral nihilistic position is not particularly meaningful. I then realized the [NAP (non-aggression principle)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle) was absolute and pure moral dogma which could not be particularly attained in the real world, and that property in itself was a construct that had to be sustained by force. I accepted this fact and I also realized that there could be different property arrangements and constructs in the world which doesn't involve random claims to the land where some person could just own land and do nothing with it.

So I was a market anarchist / anti-statist with no adjectives for a while. I then rejected a society purely without law afterwards, and realized that law had to be attained either way, through an anti-statist society or a statist one. So I started exploring ways of sustaining law in a stateless society, so I came to explore [polycentric law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycentric_law) because I realized anarchist / anti-statist solutions to sustaining a stateless society made no sense and were impracticable. I found this to be the only viable solution providing that people who did not pay for law, would receive no protection and that free-riders would not exist in such a society.

Then I realized I did not care in what manner law was provided, statist or not, I just wanted it to be efficient and quick. I still supported a stateless society though because I thought it was the most efficient way to deliver immediate and good law. Thus I supported environmental laws and standards to an extent regardless of how they were provided.

The next step was me realizing there was little difference between private property, a private community, and the state. They are both sustained by force, have arbitrary rules, and thus have little differences between the way they are sustained and the rules they make.

The final blow I think was my interest in positive psychology and behavioral economics. I learned that the libertarian notion of utility is absolutely vague and arbitrary, and that the **individual** *does not know what's always in their best interest* speaking in absolute terms. Take drug addicts, alcohols, and obese people. They could all be objectively well off and psychologically happier if they broke their addiction. I thus rejected a rational model of economics and learned that psychology is just as important in economics.

Around the last 3 is when I decided I could no longer call myself an anti-statist or a libertarian. I interacted with more libertarians and I just found myself distancing myself away from them.

**TL;DR:** *Nah, no more free lives left. Go read it for ya self, ya lazy bum!*

**Edit:** *I should add between the period of time where I made the distinction between law and state, I also made the distinction between government and law.*

**Edit 2:** *I also felt like a stateless society has never properly existed, or at least not one that accurately represents the anarcho-capitalist vision.* ^^^[(comment)](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1f8j7p/leaving_libertarianism_exlibertarians_what_made/ca7wmpd)

1363172424.0,81,self.PoliticalDiscussion,1a7jf6,What are some necessary changes you feel the libertarian movement has to made in order to gain mainstream sympathy? Let's have honest discussion about the merits and ills of libertarianism and the future merge of conservatism and libertarianism. ,118,37,792,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1a7jf6/what_are_some_necessary_changes_you_feel_the/,"Libertarians seem to be a very strong force on the internet and their tone is often very ... uncompromising, but they still seem to gain little traction in the political circus. With the recent attention for Rand Paul due to his monumental Filibuster I feel Paul’s filibuster symbolized a reintegration of the libertarian and conservative principles, at least for the time being and a chance for libertarians to make some gains within the Republican party to rise to a more powerful position. With that in mind, I'd like to talk about the necessary changes the libertarian movement has to make in order to gain mainstream traction. 

Personally I feel libertarians ought to start more flexible on their political goals if they ever want to achieve something. The libertarian movement seems to be heavily influenced by a very deontological approach to ""making politics"". A lot of libertarian I've meet tend to insist on the purity of their ideals a hundred percent and by default are very dismissive and hostile towards other political believes. While there is merits in ""staying true to their believes"" I feel that it makes it impossible for the mainstream of other people to find a middle ground with the libertarian ideology. If you view government as evil and taxes as theft there is no middle ground for me as a progressive liberal to discuss with you and while I can take your opinion seriously there is no way for me to ever consider joining forces with you on any topic. 

That brings me to my second point: A lot of libertarians act like libertarianism is the only true way there is and everybody not believing in it either lacks knowledge and is need to be educated, is unable to see the truth due to their uprising (""public school indoctrination"") or has sinister motives for believing in whatever he believes in. Peter Molyneux, a fringe but relatively popular philosopher among young libertarians, explains the existence of the state with early childhood abuse and is accusing everybody who doesn't share his opinion as a victim of abuse (and hence unable to comprehend the value of freedom). While this opinion certainly is very extreme, a lot of libertarian seem to at least share the theoretical underpinning of it. 

I think libertarians are in need to develop some empathy for the position of other ideologies and as a result of be more critical towards their own position. It's as important for me to understand why someone feels like high taxes are unjust as for him to understand why I am in support of the a public healthcare system. Dismissive hand waving, claiming the free market will fix everything, blaming everything that is wrong on  government intervention or accusing me of being immoral solely on the basis of their own moral believes without even considering mine, is not very convincing for me and often ignores the historical necessities that have driven the development of government in the last century .

1364063008.0,78,self.PoliticalDiscussion,1avc1u,"Gamifying a targeted campaign to support H.R. 499, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2013. (Details in comments.)",98,20,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1avc1u/gamifying_a_targeted_campaign_to_support_hr_499/,"[The bill in question.](http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/499?)

I tried to come up with an interesting way to try to see that HR 499 gets signed into law, so I turned it into a little game.

Now, most Congressional bills die in committee. They're proposed, the bill author gets a little press, then the bill is assigned to a committee that never acts on it.

So my idea is to track this bill as it navigates committees &amp; subcommittees, and to target messages of support to the members of those committees &amp; subcommittees in a timely manner.

Yes, it would be great to also message your own congressperson to encourage support, and sure it'd be a good idea to similarly support the bill author, coauthors, and sponsors. But unless those folks are on a committee or subcommittee assigned to the bill, the best they can do, until it comes up for a floor vote at least, is glad handle you. 

Here's how it is done.  

**STEP ONE** Identify the committee or subcommittee currently reviewing the bill.

The thread link is to the Congressional website entry for HR 499. (No ads, btw! So this isn't a scheme to drive traffic $$ to some blog for ad revenue.) Notice the ""latest action"" entry; if it is currently assigned to a committee or subcommittee, it will tell you as much here. At the time of this writing, it has been assigned to the House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations.

**STEP TWO** Identify the members of the current committee and/or subcommittee. (If it's in a subcommittee, you'll need to figure out what the parent committee is. Try googling the name of the committee, if you don't know.)

Here is the main page for House Committees: [http://www.house.gov/committees/](http://www.house.gov/committees/)

The Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations is a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. You can follow that link to the Committee page: [http://judiciary.house.gov/](http://judiciary.house.gov/)

Notice in the About Page menu the links to all the members of the committees, as well as the list and membership of subcommittees. 

(If this bill gets any traction and makes it out of the House, I'll be glad to edit in similar links for the Senate.)

**STEP THREE** Contact the members of the committee/subcommittee currently reviewing HR 499, and indicate your support. 

Here is the directory of representatives, look them up by name and you can get contact info.
[http://www.house.gov/representatives/](http://www.house.gov/representatives/)  

Again, pulling from the subcommittee page, the current members who need to hear from you on HR 499 are:  

-Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-05), Chairman  
-Mr. Gohmert, Vice-Chairman  
-Mr. Coble  
-Mr. Bachus  
-Mr. Forbes  
-Mr. Franks  
-Mr. Chaffetz  
-Mr. Gowdy  
-Mr. Labrador  
-Mr. Scott  
-Mr. Pierluisi  
-Ms. Chu  
-Mr. Gutierrez  
-Ms. Bass  
-Mr. Richmond   

Different methods of contact will result in different levels of persuasiveness. Obviously the more time-consuming methods will also have the most effect. And naturally, voters in their district (""constituents""), and donors to their campaigns, will necessarily get more attention; that's just the game. I've found that even a symbolic $5 donation will guarantee at least a written letter in reply. Maybe less will work, I haven't tried it.

But *anything* is better than nothing. I've set up a rough scoring guide, maybe we could turn this into a friendly game to see who can rack up the most points. The listed points are based on non-donor, non-constituents. Multiply the point by 3 if you are a constituent, by 2 if you accompany your communication with a symbolic donation ($1 to $5), and by 4 if you accompany it with a substantial donation. 

PLEASE DO BE CAUTIOUS WITH DONATIONS. You do not want to send money to support the future campaign of some jackass, so please read up on a Rep or Senator before sending them a single dime.

Here's how to self score:  

1 point: email  
2 points: phone call  
4 points: snail mail letter  
10 points: in person visit to local office

On a fundamental level, the ""American Dream"" can be described as upward mobility.  However, to quote [University of Michigan sociologist Fabian Pfeffer](http://www.ns.umich.edu/new/releases/20726-exceptional-upward-mobility-in-the-u-s-is-a-myth-international-studies-show):

&gt;Especially in the United States, people underestimate the extent to which your destiny is linked to your background. Research shows that it's really a myth that the U.S. is a land of exceptional social mobility.

[This article by Scott Winship](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2011/11/09-economic-mobility-winship), originally in the National Review, also brings some interesting statistics on upward mobility, including: 

&gt;Nevertheless, incomes have not grown as fast in recent decades as they did in the middle of the 20th century. While the vast majority of Americans end up better off than their parents, the difference is probably not as great as the improvement of their parents over their grandparents was.

&gt;The EMP/Brookings analyses break the parent and child generations into fifths on the basis of each generation’s income distribution. If being raised in the bottom fifth were not a disadvantage and socioeconomic outcomes were random, we would expect to see 20 percent of Americans who started in the bottom fifth remain there as adults, while 20 percent would end up in each of the other fifths. Instead, about 40 percent are unable to escape the bottom fifth.[6] This trend holds true for other measures of mobility: About 40 percent of men will end up in low-skill work if their fathers had similar jobs, and about 40 percent will end up in the bottom fifth of family wealth (as opposed to income) if that’s where their parents were.

&gt;Comparisons with other nations can also be helpful, though interpreting the evidence is surprisingly tricky. Research shows that most Western European and English-speaking nations have higher rates of mobility than does the United States. Cross-national studies of mobility typically consider the “intergenerational elasticity” of earnings — the amount of additional earnings that an extra 10 percent in parental earnings buys children in adulthood. By this third way of measuring mobility, we are definitely worse off than Canada, Australia, and the Nordic countries, and probably worse off than Italy, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

Further, the news is even worse. Of the 96,000 jobs ""created""....here is the breakdown: 

* 8,300 or 29% are waitresses and bartenders.    

* Health care and social services, primarily ambulatory health care services and home health care services are 21,700 jobs or 22.6% 

* Professional and business services gained 28,000 jobs, primarily in computer systems design and related services (this means a lot of H1 visas)

* So 81% of all jobs are low paying, certainly not high enough to support a family- and a good amount of those jobs probably went to H1 visa holders.

I understand that for smaller unions this could be a problem because if enough people decide that they do not want to be apart of it the union could end up folding. To me that just means that the union needed to do a better job representing their members. If the union is doing a good job and the dues that have to be paid are fair, it would seem that the people would continue to choose to be a member of that union.

The court essential said that you no longer have the right to remain silent unless you specifically say you are invoking the 5th amendment. **Until you invoke, your silence can be used against you.**

[Here is a summary of the court's opinion:](http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=165262)

&gt; The individual, Genevevo Salinas of Houston, had voluntarily gone to a police station when officers asked him to accompany them to talk about the murder of two men.   So, in that situation, he was not entitled to be told about his right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.
&gt;
&gt;He answered most of the officers’ questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found at the scene of the murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and others acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victim was his.

Most of us have been raised on the concept that, guilty or not, if questioned by the police say nothing. You might assume that by saying nothing you are protected under the 5th Amendment, but you are not. Unless you have been to Law School or watch a whole lot of Law and Order reruns you can easily incriminate yourself by trying to exercise your rights. 

I am posting this to generate discussion on two things:

1. First the opinion itself. Does anyone agree with it? Am I making to big a deal out of it?

2. Should this get more attention in comparison to the NSA data-mining. If so why doesn't it?

It seems to me like it does nothing but create a huge amount of paper work, lost productivity, and a large, costly bureaucracy to manage it all.

That being said, how can one defend the existence of the income tax knowing that it was sold as one thing and slowly, but surely, turned 180 degrees into something only the middle class really pays?  How did we let let this happen, and why should it continue?

Considering that the police are getting federal funding (read ""your tax dollars"") for militarization and drones while FBI/CIA getting more advanced in their surveillance, it seems as though we are doing nothing but funding our own subjugation (not to mention that it also funds ""freedom bombings"" of the poor overseas"").

A lot of people take it for granted that there are gross 4th amendment violations occurring, but a lot of the jurisprudence is at the very least ambiguous on how to treat things like metadata. 

Beyond the government use, there seem to be differing opinions on how private companies should handle this information. Specifically, many of the libertarians impulses against these programs seem to be perfectly ok with private companies buying and selling your personal data for advertising purposes. But why do we look at things that way? Is it really in our interests for us to be allowed to sell that type of information? Legally, we can't sell ourselves into indentured servitude anymore. I'm sure there are libertarians who would argue we should be able to, but the vast majority would find that line of thinking morally repugnant. So why not extend individual protections for control of our physical bodies to control of our non-physical identities? 

If companies would be losing valuable information then at the very least couldn't we have requirements that those data points be made anonymous for those purposes? Is that even possible?

I guess what I'm getting at is that when any person goes online every single website they visit is pulling location information, browsing information, etc. All of this is ostensibly to improve their products, and we definitely all tacitly agree to these business practices on one level or another. But maybe we'd be better off if it wasn't so simple. Maybe it'd be better if any sort of trade-off regarding personal information for access occurred under a more limited framework. Maybe a company can use that info but can't sell it. Maybe there has to be some sort of ""black box"" clearinghouse that the info passes through making it impossible to link it back to a specific individual. Maybe something else.

The upshot of all of this, beyond protections against government intrusion, could be a stronger consumer hand regarding access to online content. Everyone in the traditional media establishments bemoan the collapse of the older advertising regimes, this might be a way to increase the value of this information to the point where a media consumer can trade their data in an anonymous way and benefit content providers even more. 

All of that aggregated data about you is cheap right now because it can come from anywhere and is traded cheaply. If a particular website can't sell your information but only provide a base for targeted advertising that would increase ad rates for that particular website and increase their revenue, hopefully leading to a better business model.

If Mittens wants to attack Obama for words his preacher said, then why can't we attack Mittens for the longstanding racist preachings that have gone on for years in the Mormon Church. 

Here's a little sample of some mormon heroes. 

**Brigham Young**, the leader who led many of the Mormons to Salt Lake City, UT wrote:

Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African Race? If the White man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so.

Cain slew his brother. . . and the Lord put a mark upon him, which is the flat nose and black skin.

You see some classes of the human family that are black, uncouth, uncomely, disagreeable and low in their habits, wild, and seemingly deprived of nearly all the blessings of the intelligence that is generally bestowed upon mankind. The first man that committed the odious crime of killing one of his brethren will be cursed the longest of any one of the children of Adam. Cain slew his brother. Cain might have been killed, and that would have put a termination to that line of human beings. This was not to be, and the Lord put a mark upon him, which is the flat nose and black skin. Trace mankind down to after the flood, and then another curse is pronounced upon the same race--that they should be the 'servant of servants;' and they will be, until that curse is removed.""


**Joseph Fielding Smith** -- not to be confused with Joseph Smith, the founder of the church -- was the sixth President of the LDS church. He wrote:

""There is a reason why one man is born black and with other disadvantages, while another is born white with great advantages. The reason is that we once had an estate before we came here, and were obedient, more or less, to the laws that were given us there. Those who were faithful in all things there received greater blessings here, and those who were not faithful received less."" 

In 1954, Mormon elder **Mark E. Peterson** discussed blacks and the priesthood in an address to a Convention of Teachers of Religion at the College Level at Brigham Young University. He said:

""The reason that one would lose his blessings by marrying a Negro is due to the restriction placed upon them. 'No person having the least particle of Negro blood can hold the Priesthood' (Brigham Young). It does not matter if they are one-sixth Negro or one-hundred and sixth, the curse of no Priesthood is the same. If an individual who is entitled to the Priesthood marries a Negro, the Lord has decreed that only spirits who are not eligible for the Priesthood will come to that marriage as children. To intermarry with a Negro is to forfeit a 'Nation of Priesthood holders'..

Would you considering voting for me?",129,55,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1foxjf/i_am_a_30_year_old_blue_collar_worker_in_florida/,"I am nothing more than a frustrated citizen, who wants better for my children. Our government, once the shining beacon of the free world, has strayed further and further from the principles that made this nation great. What we have seen post 9/11 has been nothing short of the systematic dismantling of the Constitution, at the expense of our citizens.

I am an athiest, but I believe this is irrelevant to governing. I am a fierce independent. As such, I do not subscribe to the right telling us taxes are too high on the richest among us, while the middle class is asked to pay more. Nor do I subscribe to the left not acknowledging the flagrant abuse of SNAP, TANF, SSI, and other social welfare programs that have grown beyond the temporary assistance they were supposed to be. I voted for Obama, twice. I still stand behind my vote(s) as I feel he was the lesser of the evils offered. However, I am sorely disappointed in the lack of leadership he has shown domestically.

I fully understand Congressional obstruction has been a major issue, but I do not forgive the soft stance put forth by this administration in dealing with such lack of compromise. The path I believe our country needs to take begins with the following steps:

(1) Overturn ""Citizens United"". This disgrace has permanently changed our political system into legalized bribery.
(2) Fully enact Dodd-Frank. The ""too big to fail/jail"" banks have risen to sizes LARGER than before the crash.
(3) Repair the VA, and fully fund the obligations we have ALREADY made to veterans.
(4) Reverse the debunked austerity measures being sold to the populace. When money can be borrowed at near zero interest, and longterm employment is terrible, we have an obligation to invest in our country.
(5) Declassify marijuana as a schedule I drug, and end the misplaced ""war on drugs"". Allow the states that have already legalized dispensaries to regulate these industries as they see fit.
(6) Provide incentives for companies that create MIDDLE CLASS AMERICAN jobs. It is disgusting to me that our congress has repeatedly blocked efforts to do this.
(7) Have open dialog with citizens, and actually vote in the interests of the constituency! If a measure has majority support, there is no excuse for an elected official to ignore the will of the people.
(8) Raise capital gains tax rates to AT LEAST equal with the tax rate on labor.
(9) Meaningful debate on background checks for gun purchases. I own a firearm for personal defense, but I am not a member of the NRA, nor do I believe asking someone to submit to a background check is tantamount to seizing guns.
(10) GMO labeling, and the continued influence of Monsanto must be addressed IMMEDIATELY. Once again, see #7

My intention is to raise campaign funds in a grassroots style, possibly even by way of ""Kickstarter"". I have no interest in corporate donors having strings over me. I believe it is time for a politican who is actually a member of the middle class, and can relate to the average citizen. Please, feel free to comment, criticize, or tell me I am a fool.

**Edit:** Here is what I believe to give you a round about idea of my ideology:

* Government should be here for basic necessities: Provide us with security (i.e. military, police, fire fighters), education, and health care. My ideal situation would be eliminating Medicaid all together, and using Medicare as the public option. Use this as a safety net so families no longer have to decide between keeping food on the table, or keeping themselves insured.
* Provide two years free of community college as long as you maintain a 2.5 GPA. We provided education up to high school for free because at the time, a Diploma was all you needed to survive int he world, that is no longer the case anymore. Our Education system needs to adapt, along with eliminating summer vacation.
* Gay Marriage, Abortions, Recreational Marijuana? All fine by me and would support legislation to legalize it. Same goes with prostitution, if these women were in proper facilities that were clean and regulated by the Department of Health, a lot of these women and johns would be better off.
* We need to stop going back and forth between Fiscal and Monetary policies because history has proven they don't work. I believe in using Project Socrates to figure out what technology to invest in. It's what Reagan did, and it contributed vastly to the technology boom of Clinton's presidency. We need to invest in technology, not economics.

Liberals desire to increase equality and freedom; Progressives desire the advancement of humanity; Libertarians desire to maximize liberty; Socialists desire public ownership and central distribution of resources; Anarchists desire the freedom from government. The common theme among these political ideologies is a shared desire to change the system into something that they believe will be better. They have a vision for society and they want to see it come true.

Conservatives are about *resisting* change.

When has resisting *all* forms of change ever been a good thing? What is the Conservative vision? If it weren't for change, we'd still be living under the British crown. If it weren't for change this country will still own slaves. If it weren't for change the church would control our lives. If it weren't for change the schools would still be segregated, women and minorities would not be allowed to vote, and gays would still be prosecuted for their sexual preferences. 

These are all good things, and these are all things that Conservatives resisted. On top of all that, Conservatism failed to stop change from coming every single time. It always seems like Conservatives are on the wrong side of history. Conservatism seems like a failed ideology.

Conservatives resist change as hard as they can, but no matter how hard they try things just keep changing. The slaves were freed, women and minorities vote, segregation was ended, the church's power has been reduced to practically nothing, and the list goes on and on. It's like trying to stop a river with your hands. If the people want change, it *will* happen.

Is there something I'm missing? What is the appeal of Conservatism?

You guys seem to give the powers that be waaaay too much credit. A lot of these theories would involve hundreds, if not thousands of people working together. Our government is so fucking inept they can't pass a budget, I don't believe they are secretly plotting to destroy us. We live in an age where it is incredibly hard to keep information under wraps. Clinton got a blowjob from an intern and got busted when only three people knew what happened. Petreus, the head of the fucking CIA couldn't keep his affair quiet. Let me give two examples:

1) 9-11 terror attacks. One of the theories making the rounds is that the WTC towers were destroyed via ""controlled demolition"" by the US government, presumably to get us into the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. If this was really the case, who set these explosives? Surely some twelve years later one of the guys who laid these explosives would have surfaced. Where are the plans? Where are the emails? Even if the explosives were laid, why crash the planes into the buildings? Wouldn't it be simpler to just use explosives? I don't doubt the government (Cheney and his croneys) snatched the chance to get rich by starting a war in Iraq, but I just don't buy the fact that the government was behind the WTC attacks.

2) Sandy Hook. The consensus of many conspiracy theorists on here is that the Sandy Hook massacre was fabricated, presumably in an attempt to ""take away our guns"". I have seen countless posts on here asking ""well, where are the bodies?"". This to me is just lunacy. Just think how many people would have to be in on this. The parents of 20 or so ""fake children"", the entire Sandy Hook police force and the EMT responders just to name a few. Doesn't it just make more sense that a wacked out nut job decided to go on a killing spree?

Conversely, the 2013 operating budget of NASA is [$17.77 billion.](http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/659660main_NASA_FY13_Budget_Estimates-508-rev.pdf)

Additionally, Assuming the F-35’s are in service for 50 years, the DoD estimates a maintenance cost of $1.1 trillion; however, NASA’s entire budget since 1958 is only $534.38 billion. Surely, uniting humankind under the banner of exploration, scientific advancement and pushing the limits of human ingenuity is better than another war plane to slaughter other humans. 

NASA is only one example of where nearly $400 billion could be used to aid humanity instead of destroy it. Granted, NASA’s foundation rests within war, and some of the research going on in the ISS supports DoD projects, but the overreaching majority of publicly-known projects are to further engineering, medical, and biological scientific endeavors. 

Although it is easy to dispute where this money and time is spent, why does the U.S. need to outshine other allied countries that has reported interest in purchasing F-35’s? 

According to a Reuters report on the F-35, the other countries investing in the F-35’s development are Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey. “Israel and Japan have also placed orders, and Singapore may soon follow suit, according to U.S. government sources. Lockheed is also bidding for a 60-fighter order from South Korea,” the Reuters article states. 

South Korea is reportedly looking at 60 fighters, that’s it. The U.S. has committed to buying 2,443 F-35’s, and the investment for 15 test planes. Why so many? 

Some people say it’s to overhaul the U.S.’s structurally aging aircraft, many of which, like the F-18, are more than 26-years-old on average. But, considering aircraft can go 70 or 80 years before retirement, and since most reported current U.S. conflicts involving fighter jets are bombing campaigns and air support, not air-to-air combat, is the overhaul on such a drastic scale necessary? Does the U.S. Air Force alone truly need 22 different variations of this plane? 

Is the U.S. military truly so paranoid that the country will be attacked the very moment the country stops spending more money on defense than nearly every other industrialized country combined? Why is such an overwhelming fighter jet presence necessary, when social issues are crumbling in many areas of the country? I’m sure placing that money into cancer research would do a lot more for humanity than another war machine.

Patriot Act, NDAA, undeclared wars, offensive military around the world, TSA, TARP, FED, income tax, DEA drug war, increased debt/deficit without serious reduction in spending, government welfare programs, and more.

A point I'd like to debunk:
Voting Gary Johnson takes away a vote from Obama or Romney:

This assumes Obama or Romney had someone's vote to begin with.  Many people simply stay at home and not vote to begin with.  Gary Johnson may have cured apathy for some.  Voting GJ does not mean he took away a supporter from someone else.  Interestingly, can it be stated that Obama or Romney took away votes from Gary Johnson, or is it just a one way street?

I realize that Gary Johnson will almost assuredly not win the election.  Besides voting one's conscious and voting for someone whose policies you actually support, perhaps getting 7% + in the election will help people wake up to other party options in 2016.

Strong libertarians do not take the 'lesser of two evils' argument very well, because we see very little difference between Obama and Romney, and simply couldn't care less who wins between the two.

The Commission on Presidential debates was formed by the large two parties to keep other parties as outsiders, and this way the 'private' Commission group would take any heat for not allowing other candidates, rather than the Republican and Democratic candidate taking the heat.

We have not learned how to be nice to each other.""",113,44,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/14zn31/first_grade_teacher_on_the_sandy_hook_shooting_we/,"My father teaches the first grade; this is his take on the shooting, originally posted to his facebook.

------


Here are my thoughts about those first graders in Newtown for those who asked me this morning: I teach first grade. I know those gap-tooth wonders and I love them more than most people know, even the ones who think they do. This year I have had one student leave my classroom and it was like a stab to my heart and the student only moved to another classroom. One of my students is in the hospital with leukemia. Even though it is entirely likely she will be one of the many survivors, thanks to advances in medical research and treatment, the stomach acid churns. This preamble has the single point of sharing that not many people on this planet grieve more over the loss of a first grader. 

The other day Mike Huckabee stated that the reason for the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut is because prayer has been banned from school. Many immediately pounced upon this quote and Huckabee was vilified. President Obama was savagely reprimanded last year for not placing his hand over his heart during our national anthem. You know what? Mike Huckabee’s quote is not as bad or as stupid as many wish it to be. You know what? President Obama loves this country more than some want him to. 

What we fail to realize is that in that first grade classroom in Newtown, Connecticut were Mike Huckabee, Barak Obama, Sarah Palin, Hilary Clinton, Jesse Jackson, Mitt Romney, and any other person with whom we either rally behind or curse. You know who else was in that classroom? The perpetrator of this tragedy as well as the ones involved in other tragedies in other schools, places of worship, movie theaters, or street corners—including the ones that don’t make national news due to the small number of souls involved. 

Why does something like this happen? Forget about the guns for a moment and look at the way liberals treat conservatives, the way republicans treat democrats, conservatives treat liberals, democrats treat republicans. Look at the way we speak about those who, perhaps, speak impulsively or even foolishly. Look at what we say when a particular law is passed or a certain candidate wins or loses a race. We have these horrid episodes because we have not learned how to disagree. We have not learned how to be nice to each other. We have not learned that essential truth about wisdom. It is NOT the kind of things we say or do that make us wise, but that we learn to say or do kind things. 

We model right here on Facebook, in view of millions of children, the worst, most acrimonious, hateful behavior minute by minute, all 525,600 of them in a year. When a student reacts in an incomprehensible manner, such as what happened in Newtown, we suddenly become all about the children, all about protecting them, all about how innocent they are. We are filled with grief, forgetting the slams we posted moments ago about this person or that. 

We are all in that Newtown first grade classroom. Those who use guns responsibly and want to continue that practice are in that classroom. Those who wonder why the United States has 9,000 more handgun deaths each year than most any other country are in that classroom. Those who hunt, those who love target practice, and those who love the security a gun provides are in that classroom. Those who think mental health care should be guaranteed for all—or at least easier to obtain than a rifle—are in that classroom. Mitt Romney is in that classroom. Barack Obama is in that classroom and so are you and me. Until we learn to live with each other, talk to each other, disagree politely with each other, respect each other, and even forgive each other a little bit, these episodes or ones very similar will continue to happen again and again and again. I mourn the loss of our next Barack Obama, our next Hilary Clinton. I mourn the loss of our next Mike Huckabee, our next Sarah Palin. First grade children grow up and part of our tragedy is that we do not know our loss. We all died a little bit in that Newtown first grade classroom because we are just one people. 

That is also our hope.

I've decided that I'm going to work towards getting money out of politics through this organization: www.rootstrikers.org  and yeah, I know it's small, and yeah I know there are things I probably don't know about that organization, but from my research so far I like it and at the very least, it's a starting point. 

So, can everyone agree that we need to get money out of politics?  If you do agree, are you interested in doing something?  If you are, spread the word, organize a meetup, get involved.  Maybe even join the rootstrikers subreddit- /r/rootstrikers just to keep updated on what is going on. 

Do you want to know how OWS got started?  Virally... so let's do that and let's actually work towards a goal where we can actually make a real and lasting change in our government and society.

I started thinking about it, at first the increase in wages would seem beneficial, allowing more money to flow through the economy, and allowing a slight break for many hard workers. However, I feel as if this break would be short lived for two reasons. Reason number 1 being inflation. As soon as the minimum wage is increased there will be a short period of time where prices remain frozen and people will be able to buy what they want at a price they can afford. This, in my opinion, will be very short lived. The majority of Americans are already living at a level where there remains an obvious gap between price increase and minimum wage. If anything the increase in minimum wage would only shorten that gap. I fear that this gap will, within 3-4 years, begin to widen, and we will once again find ourselves back to where we are today. 
The second reason I feel this minimum wage break could be short lived will come as a result of big business' lack of desire to maintain employment at this level. It's not only big business but small businesses as well. Unless the employers raise their prices, some may not be able to pay their employees that $10.10 minimum wage and will be forced to downsize. 
So I guess I'm trying to bring a discussion to what till happen if the minimum wage is raised. Will we be better off? Will anything change? Or will we in the end be worse off? Is there something we could do, i.e.. price freeze, that could make the wage increase more affective?

1369329335.0,67,self.PoliticalDiscussion,1ewwtc,What happens if the current (2009-present) political climate constitutes a new era that will persist for decades?,83,16,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ewwtc/what_happens_if_the_current_2009present_political/,"Crystal ball time. 

**The setup**: 

One of the ways US politics can be understood is as multi-decade eras, defined by a pattern of similar dynamics that persists for that span of time. In a given era, certain ideologies are on favorable ground, others fight a long losing battle on defense, certain tactics and methods of accomplishing goals are more commonly used while others from previous eras are left in the past, etc. These eras typically have a defined start and end, bookended by critical shifts that set up a holding pattern that persists for decades. 

People define these eras differently of course; some say we're still in the era Reagan started, others say we're in the era that started with Nixon's ""Southern Strategy"", and still others says we're in Fifth Party System era that started with FDR's first term. I'm starting to suspect that the inter-party dynamics we're seeing may constitute a new era (not convinced yet, and it will be impossible to say with any certainty until a new President is in office or the parties controlling the Presidency and Congressional majority reverse themselves).

We're all familiar with this current political climate, and while our views colored by whether our guy/people are in power or not, were the parties flipped (Tea Party President, liberal Democratic majority in the House and a Democratic minority leader in the Senate with the tenacity and singular focus of Mitch McConnell), IMO we would see very similar tactics and dynamics, considering the economic situation and dual pressures of needing to reduce the deficit &amp; debt and increasing economic need among the people. So I define the current political climate as one where: 

* Denying the opposition victory is the top priority; all conventional ideological and party goals take a back seat. The days of bipartisanship as the rule rather than the exception are over. 

* The moral line for what collateral damage (harm to the US economy, people, political process, etc) is unacceptable continually shifting to allow for greater harm in pursuit of the political goal. The proposal of something like 'the sequester' as serious policy would have been unthinkable even 5 years ago, and when it was proposed and actually passed it was seen as something so bad that both parties would come to their senses before allowing it to happen, and now we're in a time when they just let it happen and shrugged. I expect this line to continue to shift in the direction it's going, where radical proposals of cuts and claims of damage seen as dramatic and sensationalist will come to be seen as normal and accepted (shifting Overton Window on this). 

* The opposition is not legitimate: whether they got in through gerrymandering, Citizens United 01%ers money, ACORN, damage from leaking a sneaky videotape taken at a donors dinner, etc, the underlying theme is that the winner did not win a fair fight in a fair and square way. 

* (Others can fill in more definitions of this era, this is just a rough sense of it)

**The question**: 

So (regardless of whether you agree with this premise or are willing to suspend disbelief to entertain it for sake of argument) **if this political climate is the new normal... what happens if this goes on for 30-40 years?** And what ultimately brings it to an end?

So why not have fact checkers there?

I realize that a large part of the reason might have to do with time.  Yes, I know looking stuff up is not instant.  However, I don't know how long it actually takes.  I feel like there could be a few solutions here.

1. Would it be something that could be looked up during some forced commercial breaks?  

2. If research takes longer than that (which I imagine it does), why not have fact checkers give a report at the beginning of debate two over what happened in debate one, then they could report on debate two during debate three, and we could add a final debate to clear up debate three, and during that the candidates can only say their ""overall closing remarks,"" not add anything new.

I like to think that I have a decent understanding of the conservative thinking, basically like this: the government tends to be generally bad and corrupt at doing anything, so government should be very limited; it is better to let the free market handle things. I understand this thinking, and I agree with it to a fair extent.

However, when it comes to the government's powers to do things secretly, like the NSA spying, many conservative/right-wing people seem to think it is OK for the government to be doing those things. This makes no sense to me at all. If the government is bad and corrupt at doing things in general, certainly it will be even worse and even more corrupt when it does things in secret?

Having thought a lot about this, I really cannot figure it out. How are these people thinking?

I understand that there are conservatives who are consistent and therefore do object against secret stuff, e.g. Rand Paul, but they seem to be a minority.

The only explanation I can think of that would make the low-tax/anti-welfare policies consistent with the endorsement of secret security programs is the following (admittedly provocative, but I really see no other explanation): 
*The real motivation for the conservatives/right-wingers opinions is that they want to preserve the inequalities in society: they want the rich to stay rich and the poor to stay poor. They feel confident that the secret government programs will be mainly targeting the weak/poor and protecting the rich/powerful, so therefore they are OK with these programs.*

He was the one guy I judged to have a shot, and a very good one, of defeating Barack Obama. By the time Mr. Romney was obviously going to be the nominee, Mr. Obama's fortunes had improved, but only to the point where he was even money. At this point my fear is waining.  I just don't see a Romney presidency in the cards short of some fairly big shakeup. 

So now I'll sit my partisanship aside to toss on my political analysis hat.  I think Mr. Romney is running an objectively awful campaign right now. He finds himself on every side of every issue moment to moment. Look at the SCOTUS decision in the ACA. His campaign was all over the map on their reaction. Now he won't follow well ingrained precedent and release his tax returns. There has to be an absolute BOMB in there somewhere for him to continue this. It has to be politically a better option to not reveal if he's willing to get looked at as a shady, pompous rich guy for not doing it. If I project out to the debates I see more trouble. Mr. Obama is a very cool, even tempered man. Mr. Romney will contrast awfully with this. Remember in the CNN debate when John King asked about releasing tax returns and Romney got booed for saying ""maybe.""  He made this incredibly pompous face in response. He makes the same face when he gets questions he doesn't like, which he will sometimes occompany with asinine comments. Recall the [""unusual interview""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwga9hu8zPg) if you will. The first time Mr. Romney uses his prickly facial exprssions to tell the moderator to shove their question up their ass, his numbers will tank.

TL;DR: Romney is going to lose  because of his personality and inability to be craft cogent responses.

All of this thinking you were here to save us from the tyranny of Spain at the time (which was true). However Puerto Rico was used and abused like Spain did for its incredibly rich resources and low-cost labor (primarily tobacco and sugar). We now have Walmarts and a congressman with no vote whatsover (but still earns more than most congressmen). We have McDonalds, Wendy's, JC Penny's, Burguer Kings, Sears, pharmaceutical corporations everywhere. We do not vote for the President yet he is the commander in chief of thousands of Puerto Ricans in the US Army (and I'm talking about the ones that were born here and live here). I will not deny that the US has helped us with government funds, the FBI, different types of great organizations that have settled here and so forth. But we remain a colony still. This is not acceptable. In November Puerto Rico took a vote on a plebiscite in which a clear NO was said to remain a colony, and between statehood, independence, and the current status, the commonwealth (ELA in spanish), statehood also won the vote. You can look up the results via Google. But again, since we are a colony, our power only takes us so far. We can try to be seen or heard so it is, in fact, in the end, you my American friends who must help us resolve this problem. The people chose statehood, I understand not every American will want that, but there is also independence, which would destroy us in many ways (see our economic status), but nevertheless is a better option than to remain a ""commonwealth"". I come to Reddit because I've seen how Reddit can literally change things. I ask all of you for your opinion, and if you think this matters, help the people of Puerto Rico.

That means the highest earners paid 75% of their income on everything over about $500,000 (our income tax rates are graduated, the higher you earn, the higher percentage you pay).  The government took in $500 billion in tax revenue per year when he took office.  Regan lowered the top marginal rate to 28%.  At the end of his term, the government took in over $900/year in tax revenue.  How can this happen?  If you tax people at a high rate, they modify their behaviors.  They don’t invest in businesses that cause them risk when the rewards are “confiscated.”  The economy took off.  We had 8 years of prosperity and plenty of money for the government to create the space shuttle program, etc.
 
Bill Clinton raised the top rate to 35% about half-way through his 8 years (and raised rates for lower income earners too).  The last year of his term, the economy was heading toward recession.  George Bush took over a declining economy, then 9-11 hit, 8 months after he was in office.  The economy ground to a halt.  He immediately lowered taxes across the board to pre-Clinton rates.  We pulled back to a strong economy in less than a year.  Unemployment was in the 5 to 6% throughout his term.  We were heading to a recession during his last year but that was due to the housing crisis (direct result of Clinton’s Community Development Act that made banks loan money to people who didn’t qualify for loans).
 
Obama has not been able to raise the income tax rates.  He said in December 2009 “Raising taxes in this economy would hamper growth.”  Yet he talks about raising them now.  Are we not still in a dismal economy?  We currently have the highest corporate tax rate in the world and one of the highest individual tax rates.  His extreme regulations and Obamacare have caused business owners to hold back on investing in businesses due to the burden these cause.  They have the same effect on stifling business as raising taxes.  If he gets re-elected, he will raise taxes.  Make no mistake, when taxes go up on some, we all pay.  Gas was $1.80 when he took office!
 
There are 310 million people in the US.  Of our population 170 million filed tax returns.  Only half of them paid any tax!  So, 85 million people are paying to support the government and entitlements to the 47% of the population who get a check of some kind from Uncle Sam.  Of those who pay tax, the top 5% pay 60% of the income taxes. 
 
Logan will be quick to point out that Romney paid only 14% on the tax return he recently released.  That is because he earns his money not by a paycheck, but income from his investments.  He paid regular income taxes on the money he made to buy those investments already.  That’s why the investment and capital gain tax rate is lower, 15%.  Some believe it is wrong to tax investments because the government has already gotten the tax when that money was earned.  Romney also donated 30% of his income to charity!

The NSA scandal is clearly a violation of our constitutional rights, and I completely agree with that. However, most of the anger that has come out of the scandal has been directed towards the government.

Now on the surface, I completely understand why. The government has misused its power, and that does need to be corrected. However, I think we need to think about why the government has done this. 

Now some people have been making a lot of connections to things like ""1984,"" and how we need to hold onto our rights so the government doesn't take even more extreme measures to subdue our interests. This belief is under the notion that the government is trying to take away our rights in order to stop us from, say, having the right to assemble or right to free speech. It's kind of radical depending on where you look at it, but it ultimately tries to display the government doing this purposely to help themselves instead of the people. While I think there is merit to that argument in the sense that holding onto our rights is important in scenarios like that, I personally don't think the comparison is entirely accurate for one main reason. 

I think the government truly does believe they are looking out for the people. I don't think this was an effort to deliberately take away our rights for the purpose of subduing anti-government speeches, I think the government wants us to be safe, so much so that they will take extreme measures to do so.

And why do they want to keep us safe from another terrorist attack? Well, to keep us calm. Just look at the way we act after terrorist attacks. The media covers it non-stop in a hyperbolic fashion knowing that we will consume it, polls about politicians are often subjected to radical changes, and our views change as nation - leading us to bad decisions like supporting a war against a country based on false intelligence. I highly doubt the government wants that instability.

This pressures the government to take these kinds of extreme, unlawful measures. It's not just the government's fault, it's the people's fault. Our fault.

I still think the NSA scandal was wrong; however, I think if we want to change things, we don't need to just change our government. We need to change ourselves.

1358425916.0,64,self.PoliticalDiscussion,16qyjn,After viewing and participating in much debate both online and offline on the proposed banning of assault rifles I have emerged... surprisingly neutral. Anyone else feel this way?,83,19,418,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/16qyjn/after_viewing_and_participating_in_much_debate/,"I began looking into this issue about the same time as everyone else here, right after Newtown. There were a variety of things being proposed soon after such as more deep background checks, magazine size limits, ect... But one thing came up far more than any of these, the banning of assault rifles. Now, at first I was somewhat supportive of this being done. Which, admittedly, was a very reactionary response to this massacre. I wanted to know more though. So, into the discussion I delved.

Soon after I started I began to see where the anti-gun control advocates were coming from on this. One of the main things I asked myself after the initial emotional response was, ""Why should this legislation be passed?"". Seems like a simple question with a simple answer, ""To save lives"". To this though, someone on the right (at least of this issue) will tell you that such measures won't really save that many lives. According to FBI data 323 people were murdered in 2011 by rifles (not exclusively assault even). Now compare this number to deaths by handguns, 6220. From here it would seem the logical approach to saving lives through gun control would be to ban handguns, seeing as they are the largest problem in terms of firearms. But as far as I'm aware of, very very few Americans support this idea. I personally think it would be a complete violation of the second amendment.

Then, I observed the response by the left. They mainly claimed in one way or another that such a ban wasn't to save lives, but rather to limit the killing capability of one person. I suppose this is a valid answer, but really I still think that the main goal of any legislation in response to this should be to save lives. Isn't that our main priority? Isn't that what is being asked of the president and congress? 

Another thing they responded to was the claim that any such ban would be a violation of the second amendment by the anti-gun control crowd. Democrats and liberals argued that the amendment does guarantee our right to arms, but there must be logical limits. One example of this I saw on both Rachel Maddow and online was the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988. This law, if you aren't aware, makes it illegal to ""manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive any firearm that is not as detectable by walk-through metal detectors"". This makes sense, it is a logical restriction on the second amendment that really isn't too controversial. Hell, REAGAN passed it. They argue that an assault weapons ban would be essentially the same.

Lastly, the anti-gun control crowd argued that these so called ""assault weapons bans"" really don't ban assault weapons based on their destructive power, but rather cosmetic and ergonomic features. From what I have read, they seem to be correct. Which, yet again, if we are trying to save lives why are we focusing on idiotic things such as how the gun looks rather than how deadly is it?

At this point I must say that I can see both sides of the argument and really, I just feel neutral. I haven't seen anyone else who really feels this way though. Am I the only one? Or are there others out there? Discuss. ",,False,,t5_2sfmf,False,,,True,t3_16qyjn,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/16qyjn/after_viewing_and_participating_in_much_debate/,

The problem isn't the 76,000$, the problem is the results are pretty shitty for the amount of money put in.

At the heart of the issue in Chicago are two other issues, and they involve the ability to fire teachers who consistently have students who under-perform. Now, what the best way to test to see how good a teacher is may vary, but I think most of us agree that terrible teachers should be fired. Right? The second issue of the Chicago situation is that there is a possibility that some schools will be shut down, and many are opposed to this. But I would ask, what's the alternative? If there are schools which are so bad that they are graduating pupils from high school that can't even read their diploma (sadly, not hyperbole), then how do we go about improving them without closing some schools, or firing some teachers?

Ideally, I would love to convince everyone to vote 3rd party. Green party, Libertarian... whatever else you would feel content casting a vote for. Nothing would make me happier than for Republicans and Democrats to both be a minority. However, I realize that asking Americans to step outside their little box, to sway from their norm is asking a lot. I know we have this mentality that voting for 3rd party might as well be voting for the other guy, so here is what I propose:

Vote for your party like you always have, simply vote for someone who is not currently in office. The American population could quite easily, without exceeding their social norm, cast a vote that would be heard loud and clear by the US government. It would send a message that would change the way congress governs for years to come.

In my opinion we should be aiming for a 100% turn over in congress. Most of these people are career politicians and they want to do whatever it takes to stay in office. Whatever it takes should be what the people of America want. If we don't get what we want, we should make that **painfully** obvious, and the best way to do that is to end their political career.

I'm pretty certain that the vast majority of Americans are unhappy with the current state of affairs and the trend in the police state, accomplishing 100% turn over should not be that difficult. Lets make it happen people.

This argument has the unfortunate consequence of also giving moral consideration to both sociopaths and pedophiles.

This issue needs to be consistently argued from the point of individual autonomy and breaking apart legally coded injustices. Homosexuals deserve all the rights that heterosexuals are awarded by the state because just like heterosexuals they are consenting adults in their particular living arrangements.  Anything short of this is a double standard legally coded by the state.

&gt;  **Firearm-related homicides declined 39 percent and nonfatal firearm crimes declined 69 percent from 1993 to 2011**, the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) announced today. Firearm-related homicides dropped from 18,253 homicides in 1993 to 11,101 in 2011, and nonfatal firearm crimes dropped from 1.5 million victimizations in 1993 to 467,300 in 2011.

&gt; For both fatal and nonfatal firearm victimizations, the majority of the decline occurred during the 10-year period from 1993 to 2002. The number of firearm homicides declined from 1993 to 1999, rose through 2006 and then declined through 2011. Nonfatal firearm violence declined from 1993 through 2004 before fluctuating in the mid- to late 2000s…

&gt; **In 2004 (the most recent year of data available), among state prison inmates who possessed a gun at the time of the offense, fewer than two percent bought their firearm at a flea market or gun show**. About 10 percent of state prison inmates said they purchased it from a retail store or pawnshop, 37 percent obtained it from family or friends, and another 40 percent obtained it from an illegal source.

From [Pew](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/):

&gt;  Compared with 1993, the peak of U.S. gun homicides, the firearm homicide rate was 49% lower in 2010, and there were fewer deaths, even though the nation’s population grew. The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm—assaults, robberies and sex crimes—was 75% lower in 2011 than in 1993. Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall (with or without a firearm) also is down markedly (72%) over two decades…

&gt; Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, **most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago.

Their healthcare system is the worst in the world, where the government decides who lives and who dies, and where grandma has to wait 6 months to visit her doctor.


Now, if you listen to Democrats. Europe is a wonderful place where everyone is extremely happy and everything is perfect. Everyone receives amazing healthcare and there is no concern about the cost of it. People are extremely tolerant of each other and coexist peacefully, whether it be of different races or different income levels.


Both of these characterizations are extremely inaccurate. Republicans ignore the many advantages and positive aspects of many Europeans policies such as healthcare and education. They gain a sliver of credibility when they speak of the debt issues, but they soon lose it by only focusing on Greece and Spain, and ignoring healthy countries like Germany, Denmark or Sweden. They make it seem like the costs of education in Europe would cripple our economy (news flash: student loans are already crippling our economy, Europe is doing much better in this case) From listening to a Republican, you would think that Europe is hell.

Now, Democrats can sometimes be just as bad. Bring up Greece and you will send them into a hissy fit. They will do everything they can to place the blame of Greece onto corporations or the rich. They will not allow any blame to be placed on the government or voters. They ignore that while the healthcare is much better, it is also expensive. They pretend that America could accomplish this by simply taxing the rich, ignoring the much higher tax rates that the common middle class citizen pays. (This is my biggest issue with some on the left: the belief that we can fund Europeans style social programs by simply taxing the rich, and allowing the rest of the country to pay extremely low tax rates) They create this fantasy world where everything is taken care of and there are no problems. They tout the amazing public transit in Europe, but ignore the very high costs of living in the cities they praise.  


I would like to have a discussion on why this is? Europe is the worst possible outcome for Republicans and the best possible outcome for Democrats.

- Implement the Wyoming Rule, so the min. number of House reps is enough for the smallest state to have a whole vote.

- Have term limits for both houses to 12 years each, and increase house term to 3 years.

Note: I just don't understand the problem with this, you don't need a M4 Carbine in your closet. In Canada we have assault weapons as restricted.

**Tuesday Morning EST**

**Statement released by US Cairo Embassy condemning anti-islamist video promoted by Terry Jones (Gainesville Preacher who advertised Koran burnings):**

""The Embassy of the United States in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims – as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions. Today, the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy. Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy. We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others."" 

**From The Guardian**

""Protesters – believed to be mainly Islamists – stormed the US embassy in Cairo last night, climbing the walls and hoisting a flag with an Islamic inscription. They were protesting against an obscure Islamophobic film produced in the United States. An extract from the film had been posted on the internet.

Armed militants in Libya, apparently prompted by the Egyptian protest, then attacked the US consulate in Benghazi, setting it on fire. One American was killed during that attack.

Latest information from our correspondent in Libya is that the US ambassador, Chris Stevens, went to the consulate this morning to inspect the damage. His car was reportedly attacked, killing him and two bodyguards.

*There are conflicting accounts about the circumstances of the ambassador's death which we are trying to clarify.""*

**Commentary from Allen West (R, FL):**

""I think it’s a horrific response that we’re apologizing... We are accepting the blame for this, which means you’re going to fuel more of this response... If we are going to start eschewing our freedom of speech rights to apologize…Greta, you are only going to get even more of this... This is rewarding bad behavior. And I think you are going to see this dovetail into other countries.”

**Mitt Romney releases ""Statement On Developments In Libya and Egypt,” embargoed for midnight, intending to put it past 9/11:**

“I'm outraged by the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt and by the death of an American consulate worker in Benghazi. It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.”

**Romney campaign emails reporters:**

“You can use this statement immediately, embargo is lifted.”

**Reince Preibus Tweets:**

""Obama sympathizes with attackers in Egypt. Sad and pathetic.""

**Approx 12 AM Wednesday**

**Sarah Palin facebook post:**

Apparently President Obama can’t see Egypt and Libya from his house. On the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks ever perpetrated on America, our embassy in Cairo and our consulate in Benghazi were attacked by violent Islamic mobs. In Cairo, they scaled the walls of our embassy, destroyed our flag, and replaced it with a black Islamic banner. In Benghazi, the armed gunmen set fire to our consulate and killed an American staff member. The Islamic radicals claim that these attacks are in protest to some film criticizing Islam. In response to this, the U.S. embassy in Cairo issued a statement that was so outrageous many of us thought it must be a satire. The embassy actually apologized to the violent mob attacking us, and it even went so far as to chastise those who use free speech to “hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.” (Funny, the current administration has no problem hurting the “religious feelings” of Catholics.)


But where is the president’s statement about this? These countries represent his much touted “Arab Spring.” How’s that Arab Spring working out for us now? Have we received an apology yet from our “friends” in the Muslim Brotherhood for the assault on our embassy? 


It’s about time our president stood up for America and condemned these Islamic extremists. I realize there must be a lot on his mind these days – what with our economy’s abysmal jobless numbers and Moody’s new warning about yet another downgrade to our nation’s credit rating due to the current administration’s failure to come up with a credible deficit reduction plan. And, of course, he has a busy schedule – with all those rounds of golf, softball interviews with the “Pimp with the Limp,” and fundraising dinners with his corporate cronies. But our nation’s security should be of utmost importance to our Commander-in-chief. America can’t afford any more “leading from behind” in such a dangerous world. We already know that President Obama likes to “speak softly” to our enemies. If he doesn’t have a “big stick” to carry, maybe it’s time for him to grow one.

**Early AM Wednesday**

-President notified of specifics on American deaths


**7-8 AM EST Wednesday**

**Statement from President Obama:**

""I strongly condemn the outrageous attack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi, which took the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Right now, the American people have the families of those we lost in our thoughts and prayers. They exemplified America's commitment to freedom, justice, and partnership with nations and people around the globe, and stand in stark contrast to those who callously took their lives.

I have directed my Administration to provide all necessary resources to support the security of our personnel in Libya, and to increase security at our diplomatic posts around the globe. While the United States rejects efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others, we must all unequivocally oppose the kind of senseless violence that took the lives of these public servants.

On a personal note, Chris was a courageous and exemplary representative of the United States. Throughout the Libyan revolution, he selflessly served our country and the Libyan people at our mission in Benghazi. As Ambassador in Tripoli, he has supported Libya's transition to democracy. His legacy will endure wherever human beings reach for liberty and justice. I am profoundly grateful for his service to my Administration, and deeply saddened by this loss.

The brave Americans we lost represent the extraordinary service and sacrifices that our civilians make every day around the globe. As we stand united with their families, let us now redouble our own efforts to carry their work forward.""


**Statement from Hilary Clinton:**

""It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in Benghazi, Libya, yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and colleagues.

A 21-year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.

I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa, which began as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.

Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria, Montreal and most recently The Hague.

All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.

America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.""

**Statement from William Hague, British Foreign Secretary:** 

""The UK condemns the brutal and senseless attack on the US Consulate General in Benghazi. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, the loved ones and the friends of the four Americans who have been killed including, tragically, the US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, who is someone who has worked closely and ably with British diplomats in Libya.

We send our condolences to the government and the people of the United States and stand with them in this. Of course we have offered them any assistance that we can provide from our own Embassy and our own diplomatic team in Libya.

It is the sort of attack that won’t achieve anything. These diplomats are serving not only their own country, the United States, but the people of Libya. They were working for the peace and stability of Libya in the future.

I welcome the clarity of the Libyan government in condemning this action and of course we look to them to ensure that this is fully investigated, that those responsible are brought to justice, that such attacks are prevented in future and that the security of all diplomatic missions is maintained. It is also a reminder of the continuing need to bring law and order to all parts of Libya so that the people of Libya can have a safer, more peaceful and prosperous future.""

**9 AM EST Wednesday**

**Steve Kornacki, Salon, on Romney Comments:**

""The foolishness of Romney’s reaction is glaring. Pretending that the statement from the U.S. embassy in Cairo was anything other than a completely understandable and reasonable attempt by its occupants to save their own lives borders on disgraceful. Romney’s implication that the statement was issued at the height of the attacks is also false; it was actually released earlier in the day, a preventive measure aimed at keeping the protests from turning violent.

But this hasn’t stopped other Republicans – including RNC chairman Reince Priebus and Sarah Palin – from echoing the Romney line.""


**10 AM EST Wednesday:**

**Continuing statements from Hilary Clinton:**

""How could this happen in a country we helped liberate in a city we helped save from destruction? This question reflects just how complicated, and at times how confounding the world can be.

Some have sought to justify [the attack] as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet... Let me be clear – there is no justification for this. None. Violence like this is no way to honor religions or faiths. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of god, the world will never know ... peace.

Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety...

He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya...The world needs more Chris Stevenses.""


**10:20 AM EST Wednesday:**

**Mitt Romney issues statements from campaign office in Jacksonville:**

“Americans woke up this morning with tragic news and felt heavy hearts as they considered that individuals who have served in our diplomatic corps were brutally murdered across the world. This attack on American individuals and embassies is outrageous, it's disgusting. It breaks the hearts of all of us who think of these people who have served, during their lives, the cause of freedom, and justice and honor. We mourn their loss and join together in prayer that the spirit of the Almighty might comfort the families of those who have been so brutally slain.

Four diplomats lost their life, including the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, in the attack on our embassy at Benghazi, Libya. And, of course, with these words, I extend my condolences to the grieving loved ones, who have left behind, as a result of these who have lost their lives in the service of our nation, and I know that the people across America are grateful for their service and we mourn their sacrifice.

America will not tolerate attacks against our citizens and against our embassies. We will defend also our constitutional rights of speech and assembly and religion. We have confidence in our cause in America. We respect our Constitution. We stand for the principles our Constitution protects. We encourage other nations to understand and respect the principles of our Constitution because we recognize that these principles are the ultimate source of freedom for individuals around the world.

I also believe the Administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. It's never too early for the United States Government to condemn attacks on Americans, and to defend our values. The White House distanced itself last night from the statement, saying it wasn't ‘cleared by Washington.’ That reflects the mixed signals they’re sending to the world.

The attacks in Libya and Egypt underscore that the world remains a dangerous place and that American leadership is still sorely needed. In the face of this violence, America cannot shrink from the responsibility to lead. American leadership is necessary to ensure that events in the region don’t spin out of control. We cannot hesitate to use our influence in the region to support those who share our values and our interests. Over the last several years, we have stood witness to an Arab Spring that presents an opportunity for a more peaceful and prosperous region, but also poses the potential for peril, if the forces of extremism and violence are allowed to control the course of events.

We must strive to ensure that the Arab Spring does not become an Arab Winter.”

**11:45 AM EST Wednesday**

**Condoleeza Rice issues statement on Ambassador Stevens:**

""I am saddened by the tragic loss of life at our Consulate in Benghazi. Ambassador Chris Stevens was a wonderful officer and a terrific diplomat who was dedicated to the cause of freedom. His service in the Middle East throughout his career was legendary.

My thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of all of the fallen. They will be sorely missed but never forgotten.""


**Final Edit**

I think the most important thing to note here is that this was not an act by the government of Egypt or the government of Libya. They were originally seen to be acts by mobs, but are gradually being seen as more likely islamic splinter groups with militant ties.

If anyone really wants to change this law a constitutional amendment would need to pass, as it is a very rare occurrence that the supreme court overturns their own verdict, at least in the same generation.

So, the arguement was made that corporations are people, or at least protected under the constitution as though they are.  I know that stock holders are contractually protected from legal reprucusions based on their ownership.  However, if a criminal act, as in someone commits an actual crime as a representative of an organization, then could all board members be considered to have committed a crime?  Even further, as owners couldn't stock holders also be charged?

I think the contractual law would protect them in the case of civil law.  But criminal law supersedes contractual law.

Another option, if someone representing a corp commits a criminal act while representing the corp couldn't a corp be ""put in jail"" or shut down for a set amount of time.  I think a state could pass a law that effectively did this and based on the citizens united decision it would stand up to the judgement given in Citizens United.

Being a fully fledged human has some disadvantages that corps don't normally have to deal with, there has to be some of these that should be thrust upon corps due to this decision giving them ""human"" status under the constitution....it should be a two edged sword.",,False,,t5_2sfmf,False,,,True,t3_ut39z,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ut39z/if_corporations_are_people_why_cant_all/,

This was the statement he made. 

Legalizing marijuana means cartels will lose trade with weed, so they would switch to another more dangerous drug, which will cause an increase in supply to the U.S. Which means the more dangerous drug will be more widely available and cheaper then what is it now. Because it is more widely available and cheaper there will be more people using it.

I find this reasoning to be full of holes because it makes to many assumptions. I said that just because there is an increase in supplies for a dangerous drug it would not affect the population of the drug users. I also stated that in principle even if this were to happen, keeping something illegal because of the negative consequences caused by an illegal crime syndicate should not be a factor in determining whether or not something should be illegal or not.

The following is a brief description of the problems of modern society as well as the solutions to these problems, according to Marx and Hegel (the two bigshots of political philosophy).

According to Marx and Hegel, society is divided into two spheres; the political sphere, where members are concerned with freedom of determination (i.e. the ability to mould society into something mutually beneficial) and civil society (where people are self-interested). Civil society is the realm of the capitalists, where individuals act for their own interests first, while the political realm is concerned with the benefits of all. 

What Marx believed was that there was a need to 'politicize' Civil Society, i.e. to inject the impetus of mutual benefit into this self-interested realm. The self-interested Civil Society was simply too problematic for Marx. The 'tragic' element of this position, as Marx was well aware, was that the freedoms of Civil Society would have to be constrained in order to accomplish this. 

On the other hand, the essentially pro Civil Society thinker, Hegel, was also aware of the 'tragic' element of allowing Civil Society to continue in this self-interested way: a truly free civil society would inevitably mean continued oppression of the poorer classes of society by the powerful. However, for Hegel, there was something quintessentially valuable about the freedom of Civil Society, and we simply need to accept the 'tragedy' of Civil Society as a consequence of these freedoms. 


To me, this is the issue of increased taxation of the rich in a nutshell. The wealthy are self-interested and without the desire for a mutually beneficial relationship with the rest of society. Yet here on reddit, its certainly the will of the hive mind that these wealthy people should be taxed considerably more than they are. Of course, there is a lot more to Marxism, but this central 'politicising Civil Society' is perhaps his most central tenet.

There was a time that I agreed with that, but after thinking more deeply about this issue, I will refer you to the following from our 'Bill of Rights':

ARTICLE IV:  ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized"".

ARTICLE V:  ""No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger...nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.""

  How easy it is for us to pass judgement on the less fortunate.  The argument made in the picture above is partially correct but it's also invalid.  Sure, I agree that if people can buy illegal drugs they should be able to buy groceries HOWEVER we shouldn't be setting a double standard.

  I believe that unless a criminal offense has already been committed that drug testing without a warrant is illegal PERIOD.  This means anytime you go to get a job or now in some cases apply for welfare.  You can't set a double standard.  It must be uniform across the board.  Articles four and five of our Bill of Rights above state that drug testing without probable cause is a clear violation of our fundamental rights.

So let me make something clear in addition to this. The Constitution allows a provision that states we are not to self incriminate.  I say ban warrantless drug testing. PERIOD.

1335652088.0,59,self.PoliticalDiscussion,sxd2r,How do you tell people they're being lied to and manipulated by a corrupt network of businessmen and politicians without sounding like a lunatic?,97,38,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/sxd2r/how_do_you_tell_people_theyre_being_lied_to_and/,"Our society is conditioned to reject anyone with a conspiracy theory as a radical who can't be trusted.  What about when the conspiracy is true?  In addition, the people who need to be convinced of this are the most naturally opposed to believing it, how do we win this fight, educate the people, and save America? 

For the record, here is my idea:  
  
The idea that the (primarily old-money) super-rich politically influential members of society and the corporations they control are working together to disadvantage the poor and minorities, eliminate social mobility, and cement their position as the ruling elite.  They accomplish this through social conditioning, manipulation of the media, and government legislation.  
  
“There is...an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth, without either virtue or talents.... The artificial aristocracy is a mischievous ingredient in government, and provisions should be made to prevent its ascendancy.” --Thomas Jefferson  
  
Those with wealth and power will always seek to protect their wealth and power.  They are threatened by you and me.  They fear our creative potential.  *They fear our ability to become rich and powerful and dilute their influence.*  They are working to move society to one solidly divided between the rich ruling class and the oppressed poor.  People can be motherfuckers sometimes.  It is *not* unreasonable to believe that those with wealth and power might in fact be motherfuckers working for their own benefit giving no fucks about anyone else.  They want to encourage everyone to be""part of the system"" because they control the system.  They want you to grow up to be unquestioning of authority, spoon fed biased information, and not hold your elected leaders accountable for their actions.  

The less educated, informed, and questioning you are the less responsible they have to be.  The millions spent on campaigns to feed the masses biased information, and the relationship between campaign funding and electoral success show how powerful manipulation of the media really is.  The rich own the media.  They can't own the internet.  Surprised about SOPA and ACTA yet?

Social conditioning goes much farther than that.  Our society has been molded into one of conformity.  ""Go to school get good grades, get a good job.""  ""Don't speak out against authority.""  Students who go against the standard path are beaten into conformity by the system.  Free thinking is discouraged, doing exactly what you're told, exactly how you're told is encouraged.  People are trying to promote the idea that it is ""Un-American"" to pursue socially progressive policy, even though that's what brought America into the international spotlight as a successful world leading nation.  We are taught that we should not question our government or its employees when they abuse their power.  We are being molded into the perfect working class to support the ruling elite.
  
By abolishing minimum wage, wages will be forced down trapping the poor in poverty. These poor people won't be able to afford private schools or health care, putting them at further disadvantage. Privatization of services society relies on will only benefit the rich and hurt the poor. Robert La Follette said ""when transportation becomes vital to society it becomes a function of government."" I would argue that health care and schooling are equally vital.  
  
Now that the poor are trapped and will always remain poor, they are the permanent ""working class."" How can the rich make more money? With more labor! Let's [get rid of contraceptives](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/213325-sen-schumer-blunt-amendment-amounts-to-contraception-ban) and [porn](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-03-16/news/31202806_1_romney-and-santorum-andrea-saul-santorum-points) so they breed more.  The rich are already [working with the government to suppress dissent](http://www.alternet.org/occupywallst/155141/wells_fargo,_terrified_to_face_victims_of_its_foreclosure_fraud_and_predatory_lending,_locks_shareholders_out_of_annual_meeting/) and remove the idea of leading being responsible to those over which they rule.  CEOs are racing for the highest margins and biggest bonuses instead of focusing on worker productivity and fair profit sharing.  I think it's safe to say they don't care about the working class.
  
Legislation almost never fails to benefit those with the best funded lobbying groups and biggest campaign donations, regardless of its actual benefit to society. Our politicians are [so desperate for corporate funding](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office) it leaves them at the mercy of their contributors.  These contributors are, of course, the rich who have an agenda to push.  Major corporations have found out [it's cheaper to legislate away new competition than compete.](http://www.alternet.org/economy/154962/Corruption_Is_Responsible_for_80%25_of_Your_Cell_Phone_Bill/?page=2) (alcohol, tobacco, and pharma vs marijuana for another example).  Profits are not shared fairly with those who contribute most to the company's output and is instead concentrated at the top.  The idea that being good to ""the shareholders"" is more important than being good to your workers is reprehensible and serves to demonstrate the social conditioning that protecting individuals and corporations is more important than benefiting the foundation of American society and productivity.  They want you to care more about them than each other.
  
The TSA is a ballooning waste of money, and most of our defense ""improvements"" are really just [pushing us towards a police state.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/18/tsa-mission-creep-us-police-state) Law now [prohibits protesting where secret service members are present.](http://reason.com/blog/2012/03/01/bill-passes-house-protests-near-secret-s) So much for the right to peaceably assemble, we can kill that just by putting a secret service member near anything of ""importance."" Our rights and freedoms are eroding as we allow the government more and more ability to intrude on our lives and detain citizens based on opinion. Liberty dies to thundering applause as the champions of ""safety"" take over our lives.  
  
Do you think we would have so much war if we didn't allow private companies to lobby for increased military spending and continued war?  
  
The government LIES to us. All the time. [[citation unnecessary]](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=government+lies) They give us enough lip service to stop people from digging deeper and realizing what is going on. They refuse to acknowledge their own fallibility. They refuse to be accountable to the citizens. [Party loyalty](http://www.whchronicle.com/2010/02/in-congress-party-loyalty-trumps-conscience/) and [corporate election budgets](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office) have ruined our government leaders.  If our leaders are unwilling to accept responsibility and don't get voted out of office this shows how easy it is for the ruling class to walk all over ordinary citizens.
  
As someone who cares about America, and the welfare of all its citizens, I think it is my duty to push for an end to this corruption, and to push towards greater education and higher incomes for everybody, as this is historically proven to push America to its greatest heights. Allowing those who are rich and powerful to become richer and more powerful is not in the interest of all. It is in the interest of those who are rich and powerful. If we do not question authority and challenge its motives we leave ourselves open to manipulation. I do not ask others to blindly agree with what I have to say, I ask them to listen rationally to my argument and consider its merit.  
  
I shall close my argument with quotes from an inspiring patriot:  
  
“If once the people become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, Judges and Governors, shall all become wolves. *It seems to be the law of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions.*”  
  
“A society that will trade a little liberty for a little order will lose both, and deserve neither”  
  
“Leave no authority existing not responsible to the people.”
--Thomas Jefferson

When did Obama say he would legalize cannabis or decriminalize it? All he said was that he did not want it to be a priority to go after medical marijuana dispensaries that adhered to state laws. Since weed is a schedule I controlled substance it is illegal to possess or manufacture, hence why dispensaries are being shut down. 

Obama could ask AG Holder to look into [rescheduling marijuana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_cannabis_from_Schedule_I_of_the_Controlled_Substances_Act#Process) and follow the process laid out by the Controlled Substance Act to do that. To my knowledge this is the only power that the executive has to reschedule or unschedule a drug. This process is very lengthly and groups have been doing it unsuccessfully by petition for decades.

I'm sure you have you own examples, here's one that sticks out to me:

HEADLINE: A 32-year-old woman from Iraq who was found severely beaten next to a threatening note saying ""go back to your country"" died on Saturday.

Angry yet?  A lot of people were.  But we certainly would respect the judicial process and let the truth come out while discussing all possibilities?  Not really.

Fuck these people. I hate them.""

To be fair not everyone was so reactionary, but the general tone of the thread was that a hate crime definitely occurred, we should be sad at our country, and posts suggesting otherwise were mostly buried in down votes.  But after the smoke clears what actually happened...

http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/09/15055001-police-shaima-alawadis-death-was-domestic-violence-not-hate-crime-arrest-husband#comments

The real story:  A teenage girl was forced into an arranged marriage to a much older banker by her family in Iraq, when she decided to leave him he murdered her and the husband tried to frame it as a hate crime.  He's likely going to jail for life.  Not a hate crime, typical domestic violence.  

The people who were so vocal in the original thread, so moved, most likely don't even remember the story too place.  It satisfied an emotional need for re-enforcement, then they moved on to the next sensationalist headline without a concern for justice for the murdered woman.

But this post isn't just a call out of an 11 month old thread.  It's a call for many redditors and people in general to have greater respect for rational thought.  Following headlines blindly is how the typical GOP supporter is convinced to support tax cuts for the wealthy that hurt their own community.  Reddit should better than that.

Please hear me out.",71,18,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/18ige8/if_the_goal_is_to_reduce_the_power_of_major/,"There needs to be an Inconvenient Truth-type documentary on the phenomenon I'm about to go into.

I have no doubt that many regulations are very well-meaning and many times even have the desired effect, but there is another effect that is wreaking havoc on our economy and slowly altering the power structure of our society.  The evidence is clear that many of our major industries are slowly coming to be dominated by a few power players (see [here](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/03/13/business/13place-graf01.jpg), [here](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/industry/images/mergers.gif), and [here](http://businomics.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cd0c953ef0154360808d2970c-800wi))  You'll notice that these are also some of our more-regulated industries.  It's important to see how they got to this point so that in the future we can prevent the creation and further consolidation of these powerful, politically-connected companies.

I don't think we have an oligopoly to the extent of Russia, but regulations have slowly built up over time to make us closer to that than truly free markets.  If you start a business today, not only are you likely at an interest-rate (due to worse credit) and an [economies-of-scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale) disadvantage to major industry incumbents, but you are also at a regulatory disadvantage due to compliance costs eating into a greater percentage of your profit.  Due to the nature of compounding returns, this seemingly benign regulatory advantage will have major effects on overall profitability over a span of 15-20 years.  It could mean the difference between remaining a competitor in the industry or deciding to be bought out by a major incumbent.  Just look at the consolidation in some of our more regulated industries to see what I'm talking about.

From the evidence, it would appear that while we started out as a relatively free market, we are quickly devolving into an oligopoly.  My point is to show that basically all regulations that affect an entire industry, from the most well-meaning and successful to the most vile, obvious competition-killing variety pushed by major corporations, help to create the giant, politically-connected corporations that we all despise.  I'm not saying that all regulation does more harm than good, but the evidence does suggest that there are consequences to regulation that seem to go unnoticed.  These consequences should be weighed against the benefit a potential regulatory rule is likely to bring.  Is the benefit worth the reduced competition these industry incumbents will face from startups?  We should also go through existing regulations and get rid of the rules that have likely had an overall negative effect (where the cons outweigh the pros).  There are two ways of keeping major corporations in check.  One is to regulate them, the other is to make them compete.  The latter method appears to have been lacking over the past few decades.

TL;DR - Regulation is a double-edged sword, as is deregulation in many cases.  The key is to decide the best route depending on the situation.  Some of our more-regulated industries have shown accelerated consolidation over the past few decades, mainly to reduce regulatory compliance costs as a percentage of profit, resulting in higher profitability.  The major players in these industries are the corporations we love to hate, and regulation helped create them.  Therefore, these industries would likely benefit from less regulation, not more, in order to lower the barrier of entry for disruptive startups.

Sometimes it takes an outsider's insight to reveal things, maybe? Here are my points.

1. More women and democrats are learning to use guns. Source: [gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/150353/Self-Reported-Gun-Ownership-Highest-1993.aspx)

2. The support for banning semi-automatics has dropped in the past decade, also 75% of people are against banning handguns, compared to the 60s when a majority was in favour of such a ban. Source: [gallup also](http://www.gallup.com/poll/159569/americans-stricter-gun-laws-oppose-bans.aspx)

3. It's in the constitution. I have been to the states lots of times and they take their constitution very seriously. Soldiers swear loyalty to the document when they join the US military. Like it or not, the constitution is considered just about the holiest of documents besides the bible in the USA, and the 2nd amendment presents a major obstacle to any law. 

4. States will revolt against too-restrictive bans. There are some states that have their own ""2nd amendments"" in their constitutions and laws have been passed in Montana for instance, that any gun manufactured in state is de-facto legal. Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana_Firearms_Freedom_Act)

5. USA is already swimming in guns and sales are at an all-time high. Considering the sheer number of firearms floating around in private hands, its a wonder how a country of 310 million only has 10,000 gun deaths a year whereas Mexico, a third of its population, has 11,000 gun deaths as of 2010. Mexico also has around 15 guns per 100 people whereas the USA has 90. [UN](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/homicide.html) [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2012/12/gun-own-totals.jpg)

6. You can print a gun. Yes, I realize that this amounts to at best a technologically-advanced zip gun but it demonstrates that like always, its not a magic secret, how guns are made. Source: [National Post](http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/12/21/printable-guns/) 

That's all I have to offer. I personally support sensible gun laws like a background check and no full-auto guns (but people would make them anyway probably). 

But I also support a person's right to defend themselves. Because I think it evens the playing field, so to speak, between a 95 pound woman and a 230 pound rapist or an armed student or staff at a university and a mentally deranged shooter.

So overall, I think the status quo is fine as it is. I hope the pro-gun people will **chill out and relax** a bit after reading this, because they're making it out to be the apocalypse when nothing has been even put forward yet. 

The United States was born from guns (pointed towards the British) and they've been in the hands of average Americans ever since. I don't think guns in the USA are going anywhere soon.

The REASON churches are tax exempt, is that we have a practical separation of Church and State in this country.

The reason we have a separation of Church and State, is that our Founders, through experience of very recent (for them) history, knew very well the consequences of either having a Government-run Church, or a Church-run Government. Either case ALWAYS (over the last 800-900 years or so) ended in disaster.

So they decided: government will stay out of Church affairs, and Churches would stay out of Government affairs. And it has turned out to be, in the long run, a very healthy way to run that relationship.

But once you start to allow Government to tax Churches, you must then allow Churches to have some say in Government (""no taxation without representation""), and you have just re-created the mess that everybody fought wars to get away from.

     After reading a series of comments in the recent censorship thread about the U.K.'s pirate bay issues, I started thinking about our political beliefs, how we tend to vote, etc., and wondering how other people perceive their views evolving(or not!).
     For myself, I definitely can identify a more liberal swing to my views over the past two years or so. I think that this is due to a combination of life changing events and things that I've witnessed in the political landscape.
     When I was younger, I definitely had a more middle of the road swing to my views - While I identified pro choice and wanted to see expansion of civil rights, I also took a conservative line to my views on guns, and oil - I think at that point being a criminal justice major and a car guy factored heavily into my viewpoint.
     since changing majors(political science now), and growing out of the fast and furious phase, and beginning to see the cost of those subsidize, as well of being the victim of a violent crime, I've begun to notice my views swinging, not only my more conservative views, but even my ""liberal"" views as well - with my awareness about the planet changing and the economy tanking, I'm increasingly worried about if the so-called liberal policies and policy makers are in fact liberal enough. 

The inspiration for this question is this comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tt26k/as_a_direct_result_of_the_pirate_bay_ban_the/c4phul5).

I realize that this has the potential to be a super volatile thread, but my intention is not to open this up to debate, but to simply see *why* people hold the views they hold, and *why* they change those views.

There seems to be a sentiment that the religious beliefs of elected officials are private, and to a degree they are.

Should there be a two-state solution, should we support Israel more or less, should the Gaza Strip be open, I have no clue.

From the opening:

&gt;This case is about a doctor who killed babies and endangered women. What we mean is that he regularly and illegally delivered live, viable, babies in the third trimester of pregnancy – and then murdered these newborns by severing their spinal cords with scissors. The medical practice by which he carried out this business was a filthy fraud in which he overdosed his patients with dangerous drugs, spread venereal disease among them with infected instruments, perforated their wombs and bowels – and, on at least two occasions, caused their deaths. Over the years, many people came to know that something was going on here. But no one put a stop to it. 
&gt; Let us say right up front that we realize this case will be used by those on both sides of the abortion debate. We ourselves cover a spectrum of personal beliefs about the morality of abortion. For us as a criminal grand jury, however, the case is not about that controversy; it is about disregard of the law and disdain for the lives and health of mothers and infants. We find common ground in exposing what happened here, and in recommending measures to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.

I would think that this is something that both pro-choice and pro-lief people could agree on, especially since Gosnell was accused of forcing a girl to have an abortion against her will.

I am aware states such as Texas have eliminated income taxes, but Texas also has a thriving oil industry that makes up for the loss in revenue. Will this work as successfully in Louisiana? 

In my opinion, while I understand the importance of simplifying the tax code, I believe this is not the way to do it (it seems as if Jindal is using the simplification route to make his proposal seem more necessary).

With our education system below the national average and the amount of residents in poverty ranked second highest in the nation, lining the pockets of businesses should be the last concern. This idea of allowing businesses to grow in the state is just another attempt at implementing the trickle-down theory. 

To top it all off, Governor Jindal proposes a sales tax increase in order to counterbalance the elimination of the taxes. By doing so, he is simply increasing the amount of the regressive tax and hurting low-income families. 

Although Jindal is proposing such a measure, it will take 2/3 majority to pass it as law. I do not see this happening and this whole idea simply being a way for him to get national attention. However, as a naïve 18-year-old I could be all wrong. What are ya’ll thoughts?

""If government subsidized birth control, it would reduce the number of abortions.  Many studies have shown this to be true.  So why aren't more pro-life conservatives in favor of subsidized birth control?""

The answer lies with the difference between deontology and consequentialism.

Deontology is a rule-based ethics system.  For instance, a deontologist would say that telling a lie is an inherently wrong act, even if the lie does no harm.

Consequentialism is a consequences-based ethics system, of which utilitarianism is a subset.  For instance, a consequentialist would say that telling a lie is neither inherently right nor wrong; it would be wrong only if the lie led to a poor result.

So advocates for subsidized birth control in the name of reducing the number of abortions start from a consequentialist premise.  It sees no inherent rightness or wrongness with subsidizing birth control, it only examines whether or not the subsidies lead to good or bad results (here, measured by the number of abortions).

Opponents of subsidized birth control, on the other hand, tend to start from a deontological premise.  They see inherent wrongness with the act of birth control subsidization itself regardless if it may lead to positive results.  Most notably, they see inherent wrongness in coercing people of faith, via taxation, to pay for subsidies for something that they object to morally.

The reason I bring this up is because the argument I cited above - ""why aren't more pro-life conservatives in favor of subsidized birth control?"" - is usually met in response with some sinister explanation of the pro-lifers' ""true motivations"".  That they are insincere in their beliefs, that they really hate women, that they don't care about children, that they hate the poor, etc., etc.  Nothing could be further than the truth.  It is simply a matter of starting from a different premise.

And it makes a great deal of sense too, because to be pro-life in the first place is a completely deontological position.  The pro-life argument is that killing an unborn child is absolutely morally wrong, even if it may unintentionally (or intentionally) lead to some positive outcomes.  So it is completely reasonable to expect that pro-lifers who oppose abortion based on a deontological perspective also oppose subsidization of birth control from a similar deontological perspective.

Yes it is POSSIBLE that a pro-lifer somewhere really does oppose abortion and oppose subsidized birth control because of genuine misogyny or some other bad-faith reason.  But that is not the mainstream, good-faith rationale or explanation.

So please keep this in mind the next time you hear the argument ""hey, why don't more conservatives support 'free' birth control?""",,False,,t5_2sfmf,False,,,True,t3_12unzd,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/12unzd/deontology_consequentialism_and_birth_control/,

For awhile now I've held the same conviction and I wanted to articulate my point. That's why I'm cross posting my comment into this sub. 

""...I will agree with ___, but let me begin by saying this. Everyone involved in this video is experiencing real emotions and nothing can subtract from that. They are not wrong to be happy, to record this moment, or to support a member of their family. I expect and respect that.

However, lets take away the emotions and the people involved and put this video into a larger context. I, the viewer, do not know these people and can only relate to them on very broad terms. Although I fit into almost the exact same demographic as the subjects presented, in my experience, I have a significantly less amount of empathy for someone I watch on footage than I do for people observed in real life. So because the connection between myself and the subject is made over the internet I don't weigh them the same as those around me.

To me, these subjects, or perhaps I should say this video, is just one more item of content in a larger box of media I've experience before. I file them under the soldier-homecoming box, if you will. So, as this box becomes more full and the details less clear, I form a generalizing emotion towards them; seeing these peoples happiness makes me happy. Since I mentioned my lack of empathy for people in videos then you would understand that my happiness is far less compared to the elation the subjects experienced. In fact it's sort of dull and ignorable.

If we step back even further and look at the full range of media I can access we see even more contents for a still larger box. I place my soldier-homecoming box next to the war-movies box inside the american-war-media crate, full of tales of American heroics, triumph, and moral nobility. Next to those boxes is the patriotic-music box where boots are forced into the asses of terrorists and so on. If my general emotion is positive and I don't have to think too hard to come to that conclusion, then I will just go ahead and stick with it because that is easier than disagreeing with something and not being able to do anything about it.

The more and more media content I consume, the more generalized my emotions become towards easily packaged ideas, like American Wars. Now, lets say there is a media machine with a political agenda. If they could make sure most of the content a nations population consumes is positive about something by tagging on powerful words like ""democracy,"" ""freedom,"" or ""patriotism"" to it, they could potentially generate a collective conscience about an issue. Words like ""family,"" ""reunited,"" and ""hero"" work even better - anyone who disagrees with that must be barbaric. The next step is to chastise people for not sharing in that collective conscience and if that picks up, you might achieve a pro-war population.

The brilliant piece is that our society loves putting this kind of stuff online. Nobody is forcing us. My contention is that if I see more positive than negative things about the war, I will begin to adopt that sentiment. So, from behind the curtain one could gently tweak the scales of what is consumable to the positive persuasion and you get public opinion in favor of it. So to me, this style of video is a thinly veiled, although incredibly clever, propaganda campaign.

**tl;dr The majority of media regarding American wars is positive, be it movies, videos, music, or whatever. This fuels popular opinion. If there is an unseen hand making sure this media is positive, they would be using a marketing campaign that I would consider pro-war propaganda.""**

Never mind that the republicans are filibustering their own shadow forcing crazy compromise on fucking everything.

News flash prom date, politics is about compromise, working with the other side.  Not just steam rolling them no matter what - this isn't the Bush years.

So since yall are all constantly high or something let's review some of the extremely progressive shit Obama has done, that for the life of me yall can't seem to recall.

--------

&gt;*Day 1* (literally) : Bush's last minute fed regulations are nixed.  Pay freeze for anyone in the White House making $100k or more.  Sets up guidelines for lobbyist and the whitehouse.  DAY FUCKING ONE.

&gt;*Day 2* : Obama nixes and executive order Bush setup to limit access to presidental records.  He tells dept's to comply better with freedom of information request.

&gt;*Day 3* : He issues an executive order to shut down Guantanamo Bay within 1 year.  CONGRESS PASSES A BILL DEFUNDING THIS EFFORT.  Many of you fucks seem to have forgotten that our govt is a balance of power and *OBAMA WASN'T ELECTED SAVIOR*.

&gt;*Day 4* : Obama ends the funding ban for groups that provide abortion services or counseling abroad

&gt;*Day 5* : OBAMA POST SOME SHIT ON YOUTUBE.

--------

Now that I've warmed yall up a bit let's jump into the broader shit he's done : 

- completely change how the world views america?  consider that one a freebe.

- stem cells.  remember the last idiot pres was against them?  obama supports stem cell shit.

- green energy?  obama is all up in that ass too.  you done forgot.

- don't ask don't tell?  thing of the past.  law was signed in dec 2010.  bitches.

- War in iraq? ya, we're kinda winding that shit down.  still got peeps there but we're on the outs.

- Ossama?  DEAD.

- Help women and minorities get $ for businesses?  CHECK.

- Expand loan programs for small businesses?  CHECK.

- Setup the credit card bill of rights to keep companies from fucking you so hard?  DONE.

- Require insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.  Boy Obama sure is a republican asshole.

- Require large employers to contribute to a national health plan if they don't have their own plan.

- Expand eligibility for Medicaid.  GOD HE'S PRACTICALLY A TEA-PARTIER.

- Do a bunch of other health care shit you forgot about?  YUP.  Maybe you should get off the reddit echo chamber?

- Appoint a special adviser to the president on violence against women

- Reduce nuclear weapons stock piles

- Give states extra $ for child care

- Increase funding for national parks and forests.  MAN THIS GUY IS JUST LIKE DUBYA HERP DERP.

- Expand Pell grants for low-income students

- Review mandatory minimum sentences

- Last space shuttle flight?  YUP HE DID THAT TOO.  Bush had the last 1 slatted for Sep 2010 via funding.

- Appoint the nation's first Chief Technology Officer

- Create a national declassification center

- Ban lobbyist gifts to executive branch employees

- Create new criminal penalties for mortgage fraud

- Require 10 percent renewable energy by 2012

- Invest in all types of alternative energy

- Double federal spending for research on clean fuels

- Increase funding for the Environmental Protection Agency

- Support network neutrality on the Internet

*THIS IS THE SHORT LIST*

God this guy is such a FUCKING ASSHOLE.  He's practically a carbon copy of Bush.  If we put Rick Perry in there you wouldn't be able to tell the fucking difference!

So next time someone claims Obama hasn't gotten anything done remind them that they are talking out of their fucking ass and that their opinion has no relation to reality - at fucking all.

Is Obama perfect?  No.  But given the pussy ass congress he has to work with I think he's done pretty good.

    confining his remarks to the bill before the Senate, the chair 
    requested the Senate to vote on the point of order

Senator Watson having the floor forcefully taken from him without a chamber vote was also rather shocking.

1356015748.0,50,self.PoliticalDiscussion,1563t0,Would you pay more taxes for more focus on higher education in America.,90,40,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1563t0/would_you_pay_more_taxes_for_more_focus_on_higher/,"I had an interesting thought last night, but it only lead to more questions... may be an interesting point of discussion though.

My proposal:  

Everyone should have the ability to go through higher education.

My Reasoning:  

My perceived problem with America is people who are mentally stuck in high school.  College gives most of us the opportunity to mature and grow up.  We get things out of our system, see other people from other places and learn about different points of views.  We gain life experience, and in a perfect world, a desire to continue educating ourselves.

My Observations:  

Whenever controversial thoughts are being pushed due to religious views, or ignorance, they seem to get a huge backing. This appears to be due to ignorance of both academic AND social experience.  When you grow up surrounded by people who think alike, of course you'll end up thinking like them.  If your parents raise you to think that something is wrong, you've probably got 14 or 15 years (Realistically, more like 18 or 20 years (till you leave home)) of them drilling those thoughts into your head before you really start questioning it yourself.

My proposed solution:

There is a saying that ""Those that know the least, know it the loudest"".  These are often the people who get change to happen due to their constant presence being shown in the media, and through social networks.  The general population is lead to believe there are considerably MORE of these nitwits out there due to their overwhelming presence.  Laws are created because legislators see an opportunity to remove freedoms when those particular freedoms are the flavor of the week.  So my proposal is that higher education should be a higher priority.  America is obviously going through a rough time monetarily right now, but it seems that when we do find some cash, it should be put towards more state universities, more pay for teachers (so more qualified people want to be teachers), and more financial aide for students.

The biggest change I'd suggest would be including the first semester of Freshman year at a state university as a publicly supported item.  Similar to how we pay for students to go through high school with our taxes.  Giving students the opportunity at higher learning and allowing them the option to continue it would be a better use of our tax dollars.  I certainly would feel better about higher taxes if I knew it was going to higher learning instead of any number of government programs.

Just opening it up for a discussion.  Would you be willing to pay slightly higher taxes to raise the overall education of our country?    

**Edit:**  So, after a number of responses, it seems that most people think that K-12 is the real problem (which I completely agree with).  This wasn't really a serious recommendation as it stood, was mostly curious if people thought that our country would mature if we provided a way for them to be more self reliant and further their education.",,False,,t5_2sfmf,1356036412.0,,,True,t3_1563t0,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1563t0/would_you_pay_more_taxes_for_more_focus_on_higher/,

Transcript of the important bits follows:

&gt; ….there’s a reason education SUCKS, and it’s the same reason it will never, ever,  EVER be fixed.

&gt; It’s never going to get any better, don’t look for it. Be happy with what you’ve got. Because the owners, the owners of this country, don’t want that. I’m talking about the real owners now, the BIG owners! The Wealthy… the REAL owners! The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.

&gt; Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don’t. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought—and paid for—the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.

&gt; They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want.  Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I’ll tell you what they don’t want:

&gt; They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. That’s against their interests.

&gt; That’s right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!

&gt; You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street—and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later ‘cause they own this fucking place! It’s a big club, and you ain’t in it! You, and I, are not in the big club.

&gt; By the way, it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted, folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue—these are people of modest means—continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don’t give a fuck about you….they don’t give a fuck about you… they don’t give a FUCK about you.

&gt; They don’t care about you at all… at all… AT ALL.  And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That’s what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth.

1357429111.0,47,self.PoliticalDiscussion,1615ds,"Why do people believe in the legalization of marijuana but not other drugs such as, but not limited to, heroin, meth, prescription drugs...?",85,38,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1615ds/why_do_people_believe_in_the_legalization_of/,"Obviously, the main argument I will be seeing is that marijuana is less harmful than any other illegal drug, which I agree with. But, why should we let the government decide what we drink, smoke, eat, and use on ourselves if we are not harming anyone else or infringing the rights of anyone else? But you may say, ""you would be harming someone else if you took the drug and went on a killing spree, started driving, robbing people, etc."" There is absolutely no crime committed until there is an actual crime committed. It is ludicrous to make a drug illegal out of the fear that the consumer will, in the future, harm someone or infringe upon the rights of another. 

There would also be a reduction of violence rather than a common misconception of an increase in violence. One might say that increased drug use leads to murders, shootings, robbery, and other real crimes, but aren't every one of those crimes due to the fact that the drug is illegal? Take alcohol for example: When prohibition reigned over the United States in the 1920s, there was a drastic increase in violence and organized crime due to the fact that it was illegal to manufacture, sell, and consume alcohol. But, once alcohol became legal, people stopped shooting one another over the issue and alcohol became cheaper and easier to get. Imagine the rate of murder in the United States (not even just the US, but Mexico, various countries in Latin America and South America) when drugs are illegal, and then imagine what it would be like if drugs were legalized. There would be no conflict between dealer and seller, where both occasionally bring a weapon if a sale doesn't go as planned. Also, imagine the reduction of gang violence. Many gangs rely solely on the drug trade. If drugs became legal, there would be no incentive for the gangs to continue selling their product because there would be no possibility of profit. 

Not only would violence decrease, the cost of the product would also decrease. The basic rules of economics state: with a lower demand and a higher supply, the price decreases. If any illegal drug becomes legal, the demand decreases due to an easier way of receiving the drug (you don't have to go to a dealer anymore that has the risk of jail time from manufacturing or trafficking; you don't need a prescription from a doctor, etc.) and the supply increases because companies (competing firms results in lower prices) will jump on to the opportunity to make a profit off of the drug (capitalism 101). Now obviously, drugs are proven to be bad for you, not just the illegal ones but tobacco, alcohol, some prescription drugs, etc, so decreasing the price obviously sounds bad. But, with the decrease in price, would that not stop a lot of crimes related to robbery and theft? Instead of the average drug addict having to pay X amount of money for an illegal drug, they would probably only have to pay 1/6th of X stopping the need for them to break into houses, steal cars, and result to other crimes to feed their addiction. I'm not saying all crime with come to an end, but it definitely will bring the crime rate down. 

The point of arguing something along the lines of ""meth/cocaine/heroin should be illegal because you can harm someone else while on the drug"" is absolutely ridiculous. You can harm someone just as easily with alcohol as you could cocaine or any other illegal drug. And, to say that it should be illegal because it is a self-harming device is also insane. I can stab myself in the heart with a spoon, so should we make spoons illegal because they have the possibility of harming someone? Why should you or anyone be the one who says what I can and can't do to myself? Also, anyone with a basic understanding of drugs knows that they are harmful. If any illegal drug were to become legal, would you run out of your house to go overdose on heroin? No. Because you are smart. The government is not saving you from drugs. You are already doing that by sitting at the computer and reading this. The government is simply restricting your rights. It should be taken completely out of the hands of the government to decide what you do, and it should be placed inside the household and into your own hands.

From what I've seen, the law only gives the worker the right to choose whether or not they want to be part of a union.  Since I know a whole lot of people who are in unions resent being forced to work with them, I'd imagine that this would be a win-win.  People who like the union can stay in the union, and those who don't aren't forced into a relationship they don't want to be in.

The only side-effect I could see is that the majority of workers would choose not to be part of the union in some shops and the union loses it's power.  But then, I'd see this as the democratic process in action if that many people voted with their dollars against it.  Additionally, to prevent this from happening, the union would have to work that much harder to earn the workers' money.

**The new hosts?**   The current Comptroller General of the [Government Accountability Office](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office) and the Director of the [Congressional Budget Office](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office) will act as co-hosts of each debate.  Both offices are held, at any given time, by supremely qualified, apolitical technocrats who act as ombudsmen of the federal government.  These roles are uniquely suited for acting in a professional, unbiased, public and authoritative manner, making them superb candidates for our purposes.

**The new sponsors?**  Each debate will be sponsored by [FactCheck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FactCheck) and [PolitiFact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com), unaffiliated, non-partisan political research organizations.  Both outfits will staff every debate with a team of experienced researchers to help rebut and correct false or misleading statements by the candidates.  All staff members will remain near the debate stage, in full view of the audience and cameras.  A minimum of four researchers, two from each organization, will be present at every debate.

**The new broadcaster?**  [C-SPAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN).  Since 1979, C-SPAN has delivered completely unbiased, unfiltered coverage of political activities, Congressional functions and important events in government and society.  They hold no partisan affiliation and air no advertisements.  If we are to seriously discuss the governing of the United States in a mature, sober manner, C-SPAN is easily the most intelligent and responsible choice of broadcaster.

If we want to manage this country like adults, we need to ditch the infotainment circus that has crept up around elections.  We seem set on a course of racing to the bottom, determined to celebrate the lowest common denominator in all things.  Must we allow our very democracy to be overwhelmed by mediocrity, too?  We are the world's lone superpower, and for now, the biggest economy.  We are still the 800 lb. gorilla in the room, yet we treat our electoral process like a soap opera.

Let's rid ourselves of the cartoon that has become our Presidential debates, and install a system that merits the kind of respect with which the office comes.

""It's a promise that they will never, under any circumstances, vote to raise taxes on anyone. And so far, Norquist has held them to it. As we first reported last fall, Grover Norquist, through the pledge, controls 279 votes, including both the speaker of the House, and the Senate minority leader. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have signed it. And in the coming campaign, you can be sure that Grover Norquist won't let them forget it.""

Now because of this, if anyone who wants to run on the GOP ticket declines to pledge this oath they will potentially lose their seat if they are an incumbent (to another GOP member!) and/or simply be not allowed to run as a GOP candidate if they are a new member.

When I graduated college and was unemployed for a bit of time (this was about a year before you could stay on your parents insurance until 26) I had to find health insurance on my own as just my prescriptions can run about $3,000 retail every three months without it. I was rejected a couple times for my pre existing condition and when finally accepted it was to a plan with super high deductibles etc. My question is if you have a problem with paying your insurance which in turn covers people with pre existing conditions, what do you think that people with pre existing conditions should do to cover the cost of their health care? If people with conditions paying more is the answer, how is it justifiable to make someone pay a penalty for a health condition that they may have had no control over getting?

Recently, a family member of mine had a gynecological procedure done where the surgeons removed one of her ovaries as well as potentially harmful tissue due to endometriosis.  The surgeons, via laparoscopic surgery, made two small incisions on either side of her pelvis, and she was in the hospital for roughly 24 hours.  

The hospital then presented her a bill for $50,000.  Her insurance company paid $35,000 worth, and she negotiated a lump sum payment of another $10,000, bringing the hospital’s total earnings for the procedure to $45,000.  

Now, I ask: why does a minimally invasive procedure requiring no more than a day in the hospital cost so much money?  For many people, $50,000 is a year’s salary.  Could it be that those who provide health care – doctors, nurses, lab techs, administrators etc – are simply charging too much money?  Are these people overpaid to the point where health care costs are strangling citizen’s budgets?  

Since people are (understandably) willing to pay as much as it takes to keep themselves healthy, couldn’t it be argued that the “gatekeepers” of healthcare have no incentive to keep costs down?  Put another way: is greed essentially the driving force of skyrocketing health-care costs?

Lets start with a few facts;

First and foremost:

Just as there have always been poor in our society, there have been and always will be addicts.

Second:

The cost of the war on drugs in direct and indirect costs (policing, prison, trials, insurance, lost wages...) to each person, man woman and child, in the United States is believed to be on the order of about $250.00 to $500.00 per year.

Third:

The large majority of all murders in the United States, 17034 in 2006 , are related to drugs in one way or another as are the majority of all other violent and property crimes

Fourth:

Drug trafficking and its resultant corruption is responsible for the instability of several countries in the world and in some cases directly finances terrorist organizations.

Fifth:

Business, any business, either works on the principle of  positive RETURN ON INVESTMENT or it fails and dies.

Six:

Drug trafficking is a business.

The war on drugs is costly and regardless what the government says we are loosing it.  Drug related crime cost billions of dollars both in taxes and insurance costs not to mention lives.  So what are we going to do?  Here is a bold new idea that results in beneficial domestic and international results.


Soft Drugs:

First, legalize marijuana and treat it in the same vain as alcohol. Market forces will force the price down, driving the current marijuana dealing network and their suppliers out of business.  There will be no adequate RETURN ON INVESTMENT for the small time marijuana dealer so little Johnny and Susie will be safe in the school yard and the play ground. After all, how many freelance alcohol dealers do you see plying young people with moonshine. This also frees up police resources that will result in a lowering of taxes and in addition governments will be collecting new 'sin' taxes on the marijuana . 
But you say,  “Then you will have all these adults driving around stoned on legal marijuana”. Well guess what, we have already got impaired drivers on the roads and they are in the vast minority. It stands to reason that only a minority of drivers will be driving under the influence, probably no more than are already doing it today.  The status quo will be maintained. 
Yes, but you say again, “We can tell if a person is drunk, there is a simple test the officer can give to determine blood alcohol levels”. This is true and currently there is none for marijuana. There is none 'currently' for marijuana.  Given the requirement of such a test businesses will be more than happy to develop one.  Just the same as they were more than happy to develop the hand held breathalyser in order to detect alcohol levels.
And yes, kids will raid their parents marijuana supply and try it, the same way they currently raid the liqueur cabinet and the beers in the fridge. 

Hard Drugs:

Secondly, in regards to 'hard' drugs, allow all confirmed addicts to get a prescription for their drug of choice, that they can then fill up at the corner pharmacy for a fraction of the current street price. This reduces the requirement for the addict to steal, reducing insurance rates, or having to create a new crop of addicts that he can sell to. What, you say make hard drugs freely available. No, what I said was that people who are CONFIRMED addicts can get prescriptions for their drug of choice. Little Johnie or Susie cannot go and get a prescription because they are not already addicted. 
But, the school yard pusher will get them addicted. What school yard pusher? What is the RETURN ON INVESTMENT to the pusher if once he gets little Johnie or Susie addicted they can just go the the doctor for a prescription and then get the drugs legally cheaper and with quality control. After all will he be able to undercut the free market price and make a living? No he won't, so the low end pushers will disappear and because the cost of a fix will be a fraction of the current going rate your current addicts will not have to become dealers themselves. Yes, an addict can hold down a regular job and provide for themselves. 
So now there is no need for the low end drug trafficker and with out him the entire drug network will collapse because the sales force will not be there to move the product because ,1 they do not need to and 2 they cannot make a profit at it. As a result the 18+ Billion dollar illegal drug trade comes to a crashing halt. Then money for the drug war can be diverted to other things or not collected in the first 
place. Just think you can lower your taxes, lower insurance rates, stop the drug war, stop drug related crimes, prevent the majority of new drug addicts for being created and all it takes is to this is to 
treat drug addiction as an illness and not a crime.
Now I admit that there will still be recreational drug use, there will still be a black market for hard and soft drugs. However, that problem will be orders of magnitude smaller than the current problem we have to day.

(That's why I went to the trouble of quote-indenting each of the paragraphs.)


&gt;**Why Democracy Doesn’t Work**

&gt;This is just a quick post reiterating why democracy doesn’t work:

&gt;1) *Rational Ignorance.* Because you only have one vote and won’t influence an election, it is rational for most people to not spend time researching the issues. Attempts to curb this problem could be to require a poll test, but that is full of obvious problems. Democracy depends on voters being informed on issues that they cannot have an impact on, which is to say **democracy depends on voters being irrational.**

&gt;2) *Package deals.* When you buy things from a store, you get to be a la carte to a great degree. You don’t have to buy a complete kitchen set, you can buy the refrigerator and the microwave separately. The specificity depends on demand - few care to buy each component of a refrigerator separately, and so that stuff is harder to find.

&gt;With democracy, your only choice is between platforms that have a shot at winning, and this is usually only two or three and encompasses too many issues. Maybe you want school spending to be cut, and want unemployment insurance to be cut, but each candidate or party is only willing to cut one or the other, so you don’t get to truly vote your preference.

&gt;3) *Voting wars.* Group A votes itself the resources of group B. Simple enough. Elections aren’t really a competition of ideas, because trying to get group A to vote for not getting free stuff from group B is not a contest, it’s begging a thief. Humans are moral animals, and so theft-rationalization industries develop, which rationalize the theft with marxoid economic theories, appeals to racial identity and collective intergenerational debt, and various other obtuse and roundabout justifications.

&gt;One of these rationalizations is to call opponents of democracy social darwinists. They support an evolutionary environment that enables the irresponsible reproduction of their voting blocs at the expense of the responsible reproduction of their opponents, but you are to believe that that is NOT social darwinism, but when you advocate an environment that enables the reverse, that’s social darwinism. So social darwinism = an evolutionary environment that grants no favoritism to irresponsible reproduction of the takers.

&gt;There is also the problem of the identity-democrat, and I don’t necessarily mean advocate of the US democrat party, though that correlation high. The identity-democrat fancies himself an advocate of the little guy, and so masochistically votes for wealth redistribution schemes that harm him. The identity-democrats tend to be “progressive” on social issues and white, while the taker-democrats tend to be more conservative and black and brown (they are NOT “liberals”, they are racial national socialists).

&gt;4) *Concentrated benefits, diffuse costs.* When you cut unemployment insurance, you are no longer giving a concentrated group of people the money they need to survive, and many of them will die. This makes them extremely motivated in opposing cuts. Whereas the people paying for unemployment benefits won’t die from paying a little bit more.

&gt;The results of democracy are manifest - constant increases in spending, with anti-spending movements being flash-in-the-pan spoiler operations. The Taxed Enough Already (TEA) party has not achieved any of their goals of cutting spending, and they most certainly will not since the incentives of democracy are against it, as are many of the beneficiaries of democracy-enabled theft.

&gt;One should place democracy in the same ideological zone as communism, because the underlying assumption of democracy IS communism, because it assumes things are already communally owned and thus can be voted on. If they weren’t communally owned, if an individual really owned what is called “his home” and “his money”, then you couldn’t just vote to take any of it away to give it to people who don’t have value.

&gt;(That’s another reason many are militantly pro-democracy: without it, nobody would care what they said or thought. Democracy is 1 person = 1 vote, giving worthless people a level of influence they couldn’t achieve by honest means.)

&gt;Democracy is a form of communism. And the US is a representative democracy. My prediction is that democracy will be remembered as a form of communism, and just as we wonder how the USSR lasted as long as it did under the impossible regime of explicit communism, people will marvel at how the USA lasted as long as it did under a regime of implicit communism. This is easy to understand, but difficult for most to swallow.

&gt;One last point is that democracy is inconsistent. Man supposedly needs a state because if left to his own devices it’ll be Mad Max, yet this state is to be controlled either through popularity contests (representative democracy) or man’s own judgement on abstract issues which he has no rational incentive to properly research (direct democracy). Man is fallen so needs a state, but this state is to be controlled by man? Monarchy is at least consistent in this regard.

In the coming weeks and months more and more scandals concerning police brutality are all going to surface. Some may even go farther and follow Chris Dorner down the path of murdering cops. When these stories surface, we as a public need to not run away from this issue, we cannot let the government cover it up, we need to deal with this issue and deal with it right now. Unlike how the Catholic Church has dealt with priests molesting children, we cannot let this be swept under the rug. The time to deal with police corruption/brutality is now; we need to start collecting information on ideas on how to best deal with this serious pandemic that all major city police areas see. I personally urge for a non-violent form in doing so, such as through policies or legislation that supports a more open and safer system for our police force to have their main goal being the protection of citizens of the United States and not their own personal interests. They are here to serve the public not the other way around. We pay for their salaries, they work for us. They should uphold the law while protecting the public. I can only hope for a better tomorrow, let us bring intellectual discussion and be critical of all ideas, so as to finally bring an end to this onslaught of injustice wrought on the U.S. public for decades, but in a constructive and peaceful manner.

edit:those concerned that we are trying to figure our social problems out after the fact, I agree, we should not be a reacting society we need to be a preventative one, I would rather there have been policies in place that would not allow for mass shootings to occur, but they do, and we need to deal with the issues. Saying, "" I can't comment on this situation because if I do it will look like I am using this situation to further my position politically or socially."" NO NO NO.  if we cannot bring somewhat of an intellectual discourse on this subject, then what the hell is the point.

Q: Is there any executive power the Bush administration has claimed or exercised that you think is unconstitutional?

A: I believe the Administration’s use of executive authority to over-classify information is a bad idea. We need to restore the balance between the necessarily secret and the necessity of openness in our democracy--which is why I have called for a National Declassification Center.

    *The detention of American citizens, without access to counsel, fair procedure, or pursuant to judicial authorization, as enemy combatants is unconstitutional.
    *Warrantless surveillance of American citizens, in defiance of FISA, is unlawful and unconstitutional.

In my younger years, I though the UN was a great thing and that only paranoid right-wingers were the only people against it because they were worried that their guns would be confiscated by some men in blue helmets from overseas.
 
However, politics makes for strange bedfellows because I'm pretty much on their side now as well.

Having to deal with this shit from my own government is enough for anyone to lose their patience, but having another extra supranational layer of government that basically gives their endorsement of internet spying and censorship is too much to handle.

Yes, the UN is a great place for countries to have dialogue with each other and *sometimes* solve their problems diplomatically, but for everything else it's pretty useless. I don't think they have the authority or respectability to impose any laws or directives on all 193 countries.

One measurement that people like to bandy about on a regular basis is the unemployment rate. So how accurate are the claims we hear about what happened to the unemployment rate under each president? I realize that this information will not take into account all information that contributed to the unemployment rate, but it still gives us something to work with. Let's have a look.

These numbers will also include information about [what political party controlled the House and Senate during the Presidential term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Presidents_and_control_of_Congress#Comparing_presidential_ranking_with_congressional_control_and_terms_won.2Fserved). If the House was aligned with the same party as the President for four years, then it will say Number of years with House: 4. If it was in opposition, then it will say Number of years House opposed: 4.

The figure will include when the President took office, when they left, the unemployment rates at both dates, and the net change in the rate over the course of their office.

* President Jimmy Carter took office in January 1977. Unemployment was at **7.5%**. When he left office in January of 1981, unemployment was at **7.5%** Net change: **+/- 0.0%**
**Number of years with House/Senate: 4/4.**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 0/0**

**Number of years with House/Senate: 0/6**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 8/2**

* President Ronald Reagan's second term began in January of 1985. Unemployment was at **7.3%**. When he left office in January of 1989, unemployment was at **5.4%**. Net change: **-1.9%**

**Number of years with House/Senate: 0/0**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 4/4**

* President Bill Clinton took office in January of 1993, unemployment was at **7.3%**. When his first term was completed in January of 2001, unemployment was at **5.3%** Net change: **-2.0%**

**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 6/6**

**Number of years with House/Senate: 2/2**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 6/6**

**Number of Years with House/Senate opposed: 1/0**

Take these facts as you will, but let's remind ourselves that when discussing politics, as American citizens we tend to have terrible short-term memory. Before we make a partisan attack, let's make sure that we have the grounds to back it up.

EDIT: Thanks to comment suggestions, I will be revising this some time tonight to separate each period by terms(meaning splitting up the two-termers) and adding in the general trend of unemployment as it appeared to be heading at the time, based on a 6 month window. Finally, in the third update, I will add what party controlled the House and the Senate at the time of each Presidency.

EDIT 2: I have completed the separation of data based on Presidential terms. The next update will add the unemployment TREND that each President inherited. The trend will be based on what direction unemployment was moving for the first SIX MONTHS of a Presidency. If unemployment stayed within 0.5% in either direction, I will say that the trend was nominal. If it rose or fell 1.0%, I will say the trend was moderate. If it rose or fell over 1.5%, I will say that the trend was sharp.",,False,,t5_2sfmf,True,,,True,t3_pjjjg,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/pjjjg/the_unemployment_rate_fact_checking_our_presidents/,

And then it hit me.

Both sides of the middle-class political spectrum are looking at this all wrong.

After reading the comments on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/1dhq56/bankers_explain_how_they_cannot_possibly_live_on/), I was struck by how much resentment there is toward the wealthy in general by the hivemind. And by extension, many left leaning people. 

And I don't have a particular post to show, but I think that we can all agree that the biggest argument against social safety nets are based on the ""Welfare Queens"" and other people that take advantage.

I think people who argue for workers rights and social safety nets have been portrayed as people who want ""Free Hand Outs"" and want to protect their right to slack. And they are portrayed as people who want to kill many peoples perception of The American Dream: Aspirations of Wealth. 

When in reality, it's just the opposite. We are working for economic mobility, that is the American Dream. And maybe our perception is that the wealthy are fighting to keep us from that. 

Sure, some wealthy are, but we shouldn't focus on how much money they have, we should focus on the behaviors: Lobbying, Fraud, Loopholes, Legalized Thievery, Greed.

I've known a few people who straight up lived on the dole without working when they could: This was the vast minority of the poor in my experience.

I've known (and have been) the very poor, who've used those social safety nets very temporarily as a banister to get our footing into upward mobility: This was the vast majority of the poor in my experience.

I've known the pretty darn wealthy, who utilize those tax breaks but who haven't done anything dirty (that I know of) to attain their wealth: The vast majority in my experience. 

And I've known the pretty darn wealthy who've earned their place in hell with what they've done to attain and retain their wealth: Vast minority- but a minority that packs a much larger punch than the poor minority living on the dole...

TLDR; Not all wealthy are greedy scum, not all poor are lazy. In fact, these are the minority. We have to redefine these issues in a way that isn't class warfare and doesn't polarize people who should be working toward the same goals.

But I haven't seen many attempts to provide a reasonable and coherent philosophy for fighting a war against a global guerrilla movement.  Criticisms based on morality of the US's approach to the war on terror, usually revolve around how their policies violate the geneva convention and the US constitution.  

Does the geneva convention as it currently stands apply to stateless militias?  Especially since they don't ""respect the laws and customs of war?""  Should the geneva convention apply in full to captured terrorists and Al Qaeda operatives?  If it does apply in full, and they are considered members of militias, what constitutes the end of hostilities in relation to their release?  


If we do not consider members of stateless militias to be covered as militias (Part 1, article 4 section 2 of the Geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners or war), how should international law be written so that we can fight stateless militias without putting ourselves at an unfair disadvantage?  Should we treat them as criminals that we have unlimited jurisdiction to pursue or should they be treated exactly as normal criminals and thus require us to pursue them using means more normally seen used by civilian police authorities?  Should we be allowed to issue kill orders against members of stateless militias if we do not consider them to be members of a military?  Or must all actions against such militia members have the intent to detain without the use of lethal force unless absolutely necessary?

Edit:  I would like to answer this question in the general sense.  So while I welcome comparisons to conflicts with stateless militias, I would like an answer that can be potentially applied to situations that have not yet happened.  Also, when I use the term stateless militia, I mean a militant organization that uses violence as a means to achieve it's means but does not actively govern territory or follow the usual rules and customs of governments.  For example, while the US does use violence, it does govern territory and it does follow the rules and customs of governments.

1361381290.0,42,self.PoliticalDiscussion,18w9fy,Let's talk about Education Reform...,62,20,231,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/18w9fy/lets_talk_about_education_reform/,"*First off, whether you agree with my specific policy ideas or not, I think that we can all agree that education is one of the foremost areas in which America is lacking. Education reform is needed, and regardless of what form you think it ought to take, it will be one of the biggest issues for us in the next decade, unless we decide to shoot ourselves in the foot.*

*That said: Here are some items which I think could directly benefit our education system.*

**- Tie the Education budget to the Defense budget.**

Defense is and always has been the government's favorite money-sink. If the Education budget were mandated to be maintained at a certain percentage (ideally a 1:1 ratio, or close to it) of the Defense budget, there would be two immediate consequences. First, our schools would never again play second fiddle to the military. Books or bombs would become Books and Bombs. Not a great catchphrase, I know; but it's better than the current Bombs Not Books. Second, the Defense budget would probably stop expanding as much, since there would be the requirement to raise Education funding each time the Pentagon's budget was increased, and the requirement that the Defense budget be decreased first before any cuts to Education were made. Just a thought.

**- Eliminate Standardized Testing.**

This program has been an abject failure. I don't need to go on and on about it, since this has been written about exhaustively. But the basics are that schools now neglect full courses of instruction to ""teach to the test"" and that the basis of schools that do better getting more federal funding is inherently flawed. Shouldn't struggling schools get more help than schools that are already meeting or exceeding expectations?

**- Increase and somewhat standardize matriculation standards.**

It is too easy for students to breeze from one grade level to another without grasping core concepts. There should not be high-school illiteracy, because literacy should be a prerequisite for entering high school. If you can't read, or can't do basic math, or can't understand basic science concepts, or what have you; then you shouldn't progress farther until you can. There should be a system in place to hold back en masse the students who have not demonstrated competency in concepts which the next grade will build on. Rather than waltzing from grade to grade and potentially ending up not learning hardly anything; students should be given 13 years to progress as far as they can, according to significantly more rigorous standards, before being required to pay tuition if they wish to continue, subject to there being enough space in a classroom. High school diplomas should carry weight again, and college admission and graduation should be a real accomplishment rather than a blasé everyday thing. When Hallmark creates a holiday season out of graduation, it's officially become far too easy to achieve. 

**- Remove religion from the classroom.**

Some may disagree, but I feel that this one is self-explanatory. Religion is a private decision. Do it at home or at church. Schools are an inappropriate place for it, and including dogma in courses of instruction is discriminatory anyway, since it forces a particular interpretation onto others, who are in this case likely to be impressionable children. Teachers should be required to keep their religious views out of the classroom under penalty of professional discipline and civil liability. Schools which elect to keep religion in their courses beyond an all-inclusive and purely conceptual overview should not receive taxpayer funds in any amount.

*Just some ideas. I'd like to hear your thoughts.*

**EDIT: There's some great (and not so great) feedback here. As an addendum, here's how I'd basically handle the matriculation standards without standardized testing:**

**I would have each grade level correspond to a certain ""mastery list"". That is, skills and concepts that a student must demonstrate mastery of before being allowed to advance to the next grade level.**

**I would divide these skills into three lists: red, yellow, and green.**

**Red concepts would be the basic, fundamental concepts without mastery of which, the student would absolutely not be prepared for the next grade level. Students would be required to demonstrate mastery (by attaining at least a score of 80.0% in those units) of 100% of these concepts in order to advance to the next grade.**

**Yellow concepts would be slightly less vital concepts, without which the student would be at a disadvantage in the next grade level, but could conceivably catch up on or succeed without a few of. Students would be required to demonstrate mastery (same 80.0% rule) in at least 75% of these concepts in order to advance.**

**Green concepts would be non-vital yet still important concepts which the student could definitely catch up on or succeed without most of them, even though mastery would still be desirable. Students would be required to show mastery in at least 50% of these concepts in order to advance.**

**In addition to any new red, yellow, or green concepts introduced, Yellow concepts from the previous grade level would become Red the next grade level up. Green concepts would become Yellow the next grade level up, and Red the grade level after that.**

**The curriculum would be parsed for any superfluous or redundant units of instruction, and these would be removed, except for reviews of particularly important concepts during the beginning of each school year.**\

**Students prevented from advancing would be offered the chance to pay tuition to attend a summer school, during which they would receive individualized instruction in the concepts they need to advance. Deciding not to attend the summer school or failing to achieve sufficient results while there would result in repeating the previous grade.**

**Students would be given 12 years (from ages 5-6 to ages 17-18, depending on birth month) to advance as far as they were able on the public dime, after which they would be allowed to continue only if they pay tuition and demonstrate progress.**

Watching Fox News in the 90s, 2000s etc. I was never ever poor. Always middle-class. I had a good college education thanks to parents paying for college. Believed strongly in meritocracy and STILL do.

Pretty much any political issue you can think of, I was strongly right-wing about it. I thought homosexuality was wrong because it just didn't seem natural, I thought Democrats were weak on foreign policy and national security, I thought they wanted to give handouts to everyone, I thought they wanted to stifle the economy through excessive regulations, I thought they wanted to tax us heavily until we couldn't afford anything and so that everyone is dependent on government. I was always against big government and what my friends and I would call ""big hollywood"".

You don't have to read the whole thing, just whatever feels interesting to you.

**GOP campaigns**

During and after college, I participated in helping local GOP offices. It was fairly disorganized but mostly consisted of calling people with surveys using burner phones. I've lived in suburbs, but I've never met so many people with southern accents (Not that that's bad) but always coupled with so much stupidity. I rationalized it by saying ""well don't worry liberals think Democrats will pay for their gas,"" and other thoughts about how liberals have just as many ""stupid people.""

Every election cycle GOP staffers would tell us about the horrible crimes of Democrats, and how we shouldn't worry because they have ""secret weapons."" One McCain staffer told me this when things looked grim for McCain. Maybe the campaign suspension was that secret.

I met a lot of conservatives. Many nice people. All of them were white like me, and they were Christians and had strong convictions about everything. They dealt in absolutes, but I hadn't realized at the time, since I was the same.

--------
**Internet popularity Mid-2000s**

As social networking became popular and so did cable companies, I quickly embraced many websites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Digg, etc., some of them before they were famous. I administrated several popular Facebook Groups that were essentially built to either attack Obama, attack liberals, or promote conservatism. 

I had probably some of the most open and heated debates with liberals during these times. I felt it was necessary to correct them and their stupidity.

I banned quite a few liberals too, if they were a bit too persistent. Oh if only they knew how effective they were. Usually this happened when our many conservative friends and I were unable to counter such liberal arguments and the liberal would notice and pounce on that particular button, which resulted in bans.

After a while, I stopped being so religious. I had some debates with homosexuals on some internet forums, and realized I sounded like a jackass. Specifically the scientific claims and references to nature convinced me. I wasn't aware of any of it. Had debates regarding pro-life / pro-choice, and it seemed ever clear that liberals were always winning those, and conservatives would be forced to revert to Bible quotes and I thought that was very ineffective.

Getting closer to the election, I helped conservative bloggers write articles. I wrote my own articles under fake names. I opened my own blog and wrote at least around a hundred articles. Got to know all the conservative secret websites.

I made some extra cash from my website thanks to traffic from conservative blogs and websites and social networks. I wrote guest articles, even one for BreitBart's website.

----
**Switching to libertarian, becoming more active in reddit approaching 2008 etc.**

I became mostly a libertarian, around 2008, I joined /r/libertarian and posted there a lot. 

By this point, I had to also ban a lot of conservatives from these ""attack-obama"" facebook groups, because I was quickly becoming more libertarian and finding things to disagree with conservatives.

Some of these kids on facebook were smart, even on conservative side, but had particular one-issue topics that they were stubborn about. The libertarians were almost always smarter.

I must say, in hindsight, I had profound respect for the liberals who dared to venture into conservative blogs / forums / facebook / reddit and actively debated people. They were very motivated and probably convinced a lot of people. I'd say it is more effective than TV ads. At the time I hated them, but maybe I hated them because they were convincing or persistent.

As much of the consequences of Bush's policies became clear, I became more libertarian, and opposed to his civil-liberty crushing policies. 

Made fun of Obama constantly about apologizing to various Muslims, throwing Israel ""under the bus"" (yeah same language was used in 2008 as well as in 2012). For a brief brief time, I thought the birth certificate thing was real, examined the certificate, it was legit. 

I hated Obama simply because I felt he was a one-time senator, with ZERO experience, who dared to run for president. His hope and change message rubbed me the wrong way because it was so silly to me, I hated catch phrases. It became clear however that experience doesn't mean much as one liberal pointed Nixon's history out to me.

---
**2008 election**

I believed strongly in McCain's message too. I thought picking Palin was some sort of interesting plan that could get the women vote. I knew Palin was one of those stupid conservatives, but I said ""oh who cares biden is stupid too doesn't matter."" I donated to McCain campaign. Continued to help volunteer efforts.

I was very much libertarian by this point so I was very worried that McCain would continue more Bush policies. I thought that he would also crush civil and social liberties, but since he behaved much more humble in the 2000 elections, I thought this was all just pandering to get the vote out.

Spread viral videos depicting Obama as a bumbling fool and depicting Bush as some hero who almost saved us from the financial crisis in 2008. Instead pinning the crisis blame on the poor, Clinton, Jimmy carter. 

It really didn't matter what I used for propaganda, the ends justify the means. My standard of evidence today is much higher. It was fairly high back then but I still ignored evidence that was contradictory to my conclusion. Basically, I use to draw my conclusion first, then look around for supporting evidence, ignoring contradictory evidence. I don't do that anymore.

I voted for McCain/Palin 2008 but I didn't quit paying attention to politics.

---
**2010 election**

Around this time the Tea Party became popular, which I was at first supportive of. Then it just started to distort itself into a cesspool of probably the dumbest people I've met. I felt they didn't understand conservatism and are completely misrepresenting the name of the boston tea party.

After the whole health care debates, it became clear that governments should be caring for the sick since national defense is approved, I don't see why it has to only restrict itself from foreign human enemies, rather than foreign infections/disease. Libertarians can't seem to answer the question of constitutionality of CDC along with the constitutionality of nationalized healthcare and defense. There's a logical disconnect there.

Well once the tea party took over and they started chanting about death panels, which never happened. All those things they warned us about Obama with, were just irrational fears not based on facts. The world didn't end when Obama got elected. The economy started improving. 

I felt that Obama was just being treated unfairly, and made out to be a lot worse than he truly was. I thought he'd be weak on national security, he wasn't. I thought he'd go on apologizing to everyone, and he really didn't, he just changed the message of American leadership to the world. I thought he'd make crushing taxes with Democratic majorities, and that didn't happen. I thought he'd make regulations for businesses too much and that didn't happen either. Thought he'd tax the hell out of small businesses, and he did the opposite.

2010 was the first time I voted Democrat for congress. I started getting into way too many arguments with libertarians. And started liking the articles being shown on /r/politics (when before I hated it and was like ""fucking circlejerk!"").

---------------

**ADDENDUM regarding what exactly changed my views fully toward the left:** 

I just wanted to say, that I think a few notable famous people have truly truly solidified my alignment with liberals, because after I started moving toward the left, I still thought left ideas were crazy etc. I was still adamant that liberals HAD TO BE wrong about some of the issues so I didn't trust them. I had fully subscribed to the fallacy of moderation. 

It took a few years between 2008 and 2012, of reading some heavy books in my spare time. I guess my thirst for knowledge really helped me find such influential experts in their field.

On economics, **Paul Krugman**, who at first thought was untrustworthy, kept presenting more and more facts, charts, convincing arguments, data, that after skeptically reading his work, I just could not rationalize myself out of Keynesian economics and it all started to make sense.

On religion &amp; science, **Richard Dawkins**, I saw this book called ""The God Delusion"", and I thought it was totally whack. I said what bullshit, how does he know for sure? I read the book, (I first started reading it without buying, because I didn't want to give an atheist money), then I bought the book and finished it. It really opened my eyes. A conscience raiser this genius of a scientist. I never would have thought of myself as an atheist, but no one has ever been as convincing as him in these subjects. The book goes from evolution to physics to philosophy to politics to history. Never read a better book.

On national security / history / foreign policy, **Bernard Lewis**, this guy has written like 30+ books. While some liberals don't like him, the guy is like a scientist historian, and it really opened my eyes to the Muslim world. I read 2-3 of his books. It helped me better understand why Bush's policies were wrong, but also why non-intervention and Ron Paul-style foreign policies are also very wrong. It's sort of a middle ground and it helped me realize the subtle chess moves that Obama is making in the Middle East and why they are absolutely correct.

These people have written influential books and I'd recommend you read some of them, even if you disagree with their attitudes / political tendencies etc. At the very best it can be a test of faith of your current beliefs/political-ideals.",,False,,t5_2sfmf,1348069745.0,,,True,t3_10403l,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/10403l/my_path_from_conservative_to_libertarian_to/,
1347380047.0,44,self.PoliticalDiscussion,zppyb,WE DID FORGET: Some thoughts for the 11th Anniversary of 9/11,57,13,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/zppyb/we_did_forget_some_thoughts_for_the_11th/,"NEVER FORGET. We hear this every year on this day, and plenty times otherwise.

But we did forget. We completely forgot our values and way of life, and two skyscrapers is all it took.

Here are some irreverant but real thoughts to ponder on this day, the 11th anniversary:

1) For decades we lived the American dream but we FORGOT that abroad others lived the American nightmare as we carried on years of military adventurism throughout the world. A lot of Americans lived in such blissful ignorance of our aggressive foreign pursuit of American interests throughout the world that they were shocked when we were finally attacked. But even worse, some of us knew what was going on but somehow didn't think that eventually there would be some blowback like this.

2) It's often been stated that the difference between 'us' and 'them' is that when we fight wars, we don't target innocent civilians. Osama Bin Laden justified this by noting that Americans do not live under a monarch or a dictator. Can you really argue with that? We aren't just idly by for the ride while someone in a throne decides our country's miltary actions. We FORGOT that the buck stops with us. We FORGOT that this a participatory democracy. In so far as you believe in war, which we collectively as a people do, then we are responsible for the military actions carried out in our name.

3) In the decade following 9/11, we FORGOT that this was the Land of the Free. Nearly overnight we threw it all away. Kneejerk legislation like the PATRIOT Act, FISA, NDAA, HR347 combined with un-legislated acts of blatant disregard for the Constitution have resulted in the loss of our freedom. What's worse is we blindly keep celebrating our freedom when it's no longer there. Do folks still mistake freedom for our ability to buy Levis denim jeans while Soviet-era people could not? For better or worse, our vibrant consumer culture hasn't waned. But this is separate and apart from being free. You can still have malls in a police state.

And police state we have:

* Law enforcement and government now routinely wiretap us without the oversight of a judge, and for any reason (not just suspected terrorism). A lot of the crimes we found so aggregious in Watergate became commonplace in the last decade. We let this all slide so much that now the NSA has even constructed a multi-million dollar listening station in the Utah desert to monitor all of our private phone calls, texts and emails.

* Protection from undue search and seizure are a thing of the past. As is the ability to move freely about the country. Border Patrol and the TSA now set up random arbitrary checkpoints in the middle of highways. We are virtually or literally strip-searched in our airports. Citizens in our cities are routinely stopped and frisked. We FORGOT what we learned in school (at least I did) about the Stasi police in Nazi Germany barking ""papers please"" to civilians and what a contrast it was to our freedom. Now we allow it but somehow think it is fine because it is 'for our own protection'.

* Cross out due process as well. A portion of the military budget bill (NDAA) granted the President new executive powers to infinitely detain any citizen he deems a threat. But he was already targeting and killing American citizens abroad without any sort of a trial. Meanwhile those suspected of terrorism who do make it to trial find themselves indefensible as crucial evidence is withheld from their lawyers due to 'national security concerns'.

4) Russian media is now routinely reporting on America's oppression of freedom, rather than the other way around. In fact, one has to turn to RT.COM to get any coverage of this because our mainstream media blows it off. We FORGOT how hard we fought to see the Berlin Wall come down only to now build our own.

5) What Osama Bin Laden and the terrorists did was brilliant. I couldn't think of a better way to strike a blow to the gut (our economy) and the head (our minds) of a Goliath like the US. We FORGOT that because just because we were big we weren't infallible. We got sucker-punched with the greatest incident of psychological warfare ever perpetrated. And it worked. We laid down our freedoms in the name of safety much to the disgrace of all those who died that day.

If we really don't want to let the terrorists win, we must not FORGET the things that actually made this country great.

The solutions might not work, because the nature of the problem has changed.

Senators and Representatives who are in their 70s now learned about politics during the 1960s and 70s.  Marginal tax rates where high then, so the idea that cutting rates would stimulate growth and increase revenue was reasonable.  When they got into power they tried it out, and it worked, so they keep pushing to do it more.

The same idea goes with military spending.  During the cold war, the way to make yourself feel safe was to scare off the bad guys, and increase your sphere of influence.  It worked then, the Soviet Union collapsed.  It isn't working now because we're not fighting super-powers now.

Labor unions are probably in a similar situation.  When they were facing down the companies of the past, they could negotiate with the owners and executives.  Now, it is the investors who demand profits and are insulated from pressure by workers.  The real-time, global nature of the stock market makes negotiation with executives useless.  

My examples are noticeably left leaning, and I apologize for that.  It's the failing of my own perspective.  Please share your perspectives from the other side.

While reading a Mitt Romney [speech](http://www.mittromney.com/blogs/mitts-view/2012/05/mitt-romney-delivers-commencement-address-liberty-university) I noticed this line:

&gt; there is no greater force for good in the nation than Christian conscience in action.

He's basically saying Christians in the USA are on a higher ethical / moral plane than anyone else. To me a comment and dedication (as this line of thinking has great influence on actual decisions and can be considered hateful / discriminatory to a non-Christian / non-religious person) like this is an instant disqualification to ever consider voting for the person making such a claim. And that made why wonder on how this would go over in my country:

If a mainstream politician (heading one of the largest parties) in my country had said this a big discussion / shit-storm would've occurred all over the political spectrum. Even the leaders of our largest [Christian party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Appeal) would never use this as a political argument as they acknowledge ""morality and ethics are bound to individuals and are possible as an individual value outside"" (this does not exclude the option that they consider all ""moral individuals"" to be closeted-religious persons ;)).

I know the USA is a much more Christian fundamentalist country than the Netherlands. However I did expect some outcry on this. Yet in the USA media I cannot find anyone who's even moderately surprised or outraged on this. It's not even picked up as one of the talking points of the speech.
The point I wonder about is whether voters in the USA (at least the /reddit subset..) see quotes like this as something to take in account (when making their voting decision) at all?

**edit 2**: wowa, feel free to NOT send me hateful PM's telling me I'm a baby murderer for supporting abortion (where was this even discussed?!).

Nowhere do I claim that the country I happen to reside in is perfect and nowhere do I claim that Mitt Romney wants to kill non-believers or that he is evil himself.

EDIT: I should have put non-corrupt governments in the title, apologies.

EDIT 2: Turns out i can't spell.

EDIT 3: Thank you for all of the points and questions, many people have made some very compelling arguments which i have listened to intently, some have even provided a viewpoint i hadn't thought of before. Please may i remind people however that this isn't a discussion on the merits of a gun in self defense but rather one to do with a gun as a tool for the prevention of a corrupt government. Thanks again, if i don't reply i have probably gone to bed but i shall respond in the morning :)

I'm talking about how the mere framing of something can totally change how people perceive and react to things (or what assumptions are implicitly made). 

For example, ""tax cuts"" vs. ""tax relief"" -- they are both the same, but the latter makes this assumption that we're ""under pressure"" and need a lessening of something.

Or ""job creators"" -- makes the assumption that all jobs somehow originate from the top, completely ignoring the demand-side of the equation. 

""The President won't compromise"" where ""compromise"" is seen as ""yielding 100%.""

Or the GOP's use of the word ""socialist"" and ""wealth redistribution"" to imply negative things about trying to rebalance socioeconomic equality.

Are workers too productive?,55,13,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/18w5xq/is_our_unemployment_problem_a_productivity/,"We are several years out of the recession, economic growth is starting to recover slowly, yet we still have a level of unemployment that is way too high.

Historically, following a recession, every 1% increase in output has been followed by an average increase of 0.6% in employment. Since the 1970s-80s, that number has fallen. In the 90s, it was 0.4% increase in employment for every 1% increase in growth. In the early 2000s, it was 0.2% for every 1%. This recovery has seen 0.3% increase in employment for every 1% increase in growth.

To me as an economics and political science student, this says that we have a systemic problem.

So if we look at [this chart](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/US_productivity_and_real_wages.jpg), we can see that from 1945-75, as productivity increased, real wages increased at almost the exact same rate. In fact, the only exception is when real wage increases exceeded productivity increases from roughly 1955 to 1965. However, real wages stagnated around 1975 and began to fall a little bit. At the same time, productivity continued to increase rapidly and is now double what it was in 1975 while real wages are lower.

In the earlier part of American industrialization, increases in productivity resulted in better conditions for American workers: benefits, worker safety, 40 hour work week, overtime pay, etc. The 40 hour work week has been around since the 1940s at least, yet a worker today only has to work a quarter of the time to produce as much as a worker in the 1940s or half the time as a worker in the 1970s. [Source](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/).

Additionally, we can see that the top earners in the U.S. have recovered quite nicely from the recession. By 2009, incomes for the wealthiest 1% of Americans had completely rebounded. [In 2010, 1% of Americans captured 93% of the new wealth created.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-02/top-1-got-93-of-income-growth-as-rich-poor-gap-widened.html)

It seems to me that we do not have a growth problem right now so much as a massive unemployment problem that nobody seems to be addressing. No matter how much our economy grows, short of miracle level growth, employment will not fully recover to the ""natural"" rate of unemployment given current economic conditions.

That is why I am of the belief that we must see new labor policy shortening the work week, raising wages, and increasing benefits to address unemployment. Obviously, it seems that these measures might increase unemployment if implemented improperly, so I believe the increases in benefits and wages must be paid for by lowered incomes for the wealthiest of Americans. Let me stress that it is not because I have anything against these people or because I do not believe they earned their money. It is simply because the massive concentration of wealth AND (perhaps more importantly) **new wealth** is detrimental to the entire economy.

I do not know what exact policies should be enacted to meet these goals that I have set.

So... what policies *should* we see enacted? Alternatively, if you think my argument is full of shit, you might be right! But please explain yourself and explain your alternative.

He advised I resubmit it to askconservative, which has a whopping 60 readers, so fuck him.  

I’ve been a conservative for my entire adult life.  When I was six, I walked around with a Reagan-Bush ’84 sandwich board.  I worked on GW’s campaign and worked to organize the YR’s in a district.  My point being, I’m not a shill for the opposition, nor am I a democrat.  But there is something I would like to get off my chest, and I would like to see if anyone else feels the same way.  

I first began to become disillusioned with the Republican Party following our response to 9-11.  We were too aggressive and willing to attack people who were not involved, simply so we could attack someone.  The Patriot Act was, and remains, a slap in the face of the Constitution, and honestly, I abstained from voting Republican in 2004, solely because of the way the government was treating its citizens.  The Constitution limits government, and they have been more than willing to whittle away at the wall between us and them.  

Then John McCain and Sarah Palin came along.  One, Republicans never liked McCain; he was always straddling the fence and was considered too moderate and a “rogue republican.”  Sarah Palin.  Well, let’s just say she wasn’t chosen for her brains.  She was a token woman who was an attractive offset to her decrepit running mate.  
 
Now we have Mitt Romney.  I simply cannot support him.  He seems like a sleazebag, and every time I hear him speak I feel like a slimy used car salesman is telling me whatever I want to hear just so I’ll sign on the dotted line and drive away with a lemon that’ll break down a couple of blocks away.  

Here is what I would like to know from ~~r/conservative~~ whoever:
Do any other conservatives feel this way, and if so, what is the future of conservatism; where do we go from here?  I don’t want to sit on the bench every four years because the Republican Party can’t help but throw up schmuck after schmuck.

I thought that a post listing some of the more striking facts and figures would be interesting. I have no point to make here (I think the regulars here know my general opinions); I just thought that some of you would appreciate this bit of political history.  

* From 1933 to 1939, the federal spending on construction rose 1650% over the previous four years (1925-1929).

* The Public Works Administration was created in Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933. It had an initial appropriation of $3.3 billion- equivalent to 165% of federal revenue in 1933 or 5.9% of GDP. 

* US GDP in 1933 was [$56.4 billion](http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&amp;ViewSeries=NO&amp;Java=no&amp;Request3Place=N&amp;3Place=N&amp;FromView=YES&amp;Freq=Year&amp;FirstYear=1933&amp;LastYear=1933&amp;3Place=N&amp;Update=Update&amp;JavaBox=no#Mid). With U.S. GDP currently around [$14.5 trillion](http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&amp;ViewSeries=NO&amp;Java=no&amp;Request3Place=N&amp;3Place=N&amp;FromView=YES&amp;Freq=Year&amp;FirstYear=2010&amp;LastYear=2010&amp;3Place=N&amp;Update=Update&amp;JavaBox=no#Mid), the 2011 equivalent of a PWA would involve a stimulus package of about $857 billion composed only of direct outlays, no tax cuts or tax incentives. 

* To put that $857 billion in perspective, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act [provided $275 billion for federal contracts, grants, and loans](http://www.recovery.gov/About/Pages/The_Act.aspx). 

* The PWA completed projects in 3,068 of 3,071 counties in the United States and funded the beginning of other major parts of the New Deal like the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Civilian Conservation Corps. 

* The PWA was responsible for a myriad of major hydroelectric projects in addition to the TVA. On the non-federal level, PWA funds built or modernized the Hetch Hetchy and Imperial hydroelectric projects in California, the Santee-Cooper project in South Carolina, the Grand River Dam in Oklahoma, the Lower Colorado River Authority. At the federal level, the PWA was responsible for the Shasta Dam, the Fort Peck Damn, the Bonneville Dam, the Grand Coulee Dam, and finishing the Hoover Dam. 

* By July 1936, the PWA had built or modernized one or more schools in 47% of all counties. The PWA completed 7,488 school. 

* From 1933 to 1940, the PWA was responsible for 80% of all sewer construction in the United States, completing 1,527 projects. The PWA was also responsible for 37% of all new waterworks in 1934, 50% in 1935, 77% in 1936, and 37% in 1937 for a total of 2,419 projects. 

* Over the same period of time the PWA built 822 hospitals, asylums, and sanitariums. 

* The PWA also built or modernized 388 bridges or viaducts. Among those built by the PWA was the Triborough Bridge in NYC. The PWA also built NYC's Lincoln Tunnel and the Williamsburg Houses.

* The PWA completed 4,287 public buildings projects, including 295 courthouses and 342 airports.

* Other notable PWA projects include the aircraft carrier *USS Yorktown* and Fort Knox. 

* By March, 1939, the PWA had completed 34,448 projects on the federal, state, county, and municipal levels.   

Now all of this is very impressive. And here's where I tell you that it was the smaller of the two major New Deal construction programs. 

* Congress passed the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act in 1935 and FDR created the Works Progress Administration to administer the funds. 

* The initial appropriation for the WPA was $4.88 billion- equivalent to 135% of federal revenue in 1935 or 6.7% of GDP ([keep in mind that GDP grew approximately 30% from 1933 to 1935](http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&amp;ViewSeries=NO&amp;Java=no&amp;Request3Place=N&amp;3Place=N&amp;FromView=YES&amp;Freq=Year&amp;FirstYear=1933&amp;LastYear=1935&amp;3Place=N&amp;Update=Update&amp;JavaBox=no#Mid)). 

* The 2011 equivalent of a WPA appropriation would be approximately $973 billion in direct outlays.  

* The WPA built 78,000 new bridges and viaducts and modernized 46,000 others. The WPA also built 1,000 new tunnels.

* The WPA built 6,000 brand new schools, constructed additions at 2,170 others, and modernized 31,000 more. 

* The WPA was also responsible for building 1,000 public libraries and 225 public hospitals. 

* The WPA also built 9,300 auditoriums and gymnasiums and improved 5,800 others. 

* WPA projects also included 226 new hospitals and 156 improved ones.

* Office space was also expanded as WPA workers built 6,400 office buildings. 

* Other buildings included 7,000 dormitories, 6,000 warehouses, 900 armories, and 2,700 firehouses.

* The WPA built a total of 40,000 new public buildings and imporived 85,000 others. 

* The WPA funded several subsidiary organizations like the National Youth Administration, the Federal Art Project, and the Federal Writers Project, Federal Music Project, and Federal Theater Project. 

* WPA workers built 67,000 miles of city streets and 24,000 miles of sidewalk and 25,000 miles of curb. 

* Additionally, the WPA built 572,000 miles of rural roads. Of this, 57,000 miles were paved with concrete or macadam. 

These statistics comprise a substantial majority of New Deal public works programs, but there are things which I've left out as well since for some of the programs I don't have all the exact figures in front of me.

1317175643.0,39,self.PoliticalDiscussion,ktmr3,Why I Wouldn't Vote for Ron Paul,75,36,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ktmr3/why_i_wouldnt_vote_for_ron_paul/,"I'm sure this will get downvoted immediately but I wanted to outline why I won't ever vote for Paul in a general election, even though I don't hate the guy. 

1. He's an ideologue. While there is a lot of evidence that small organizations working without an overweening government can foment creativity, he's arguing to put the well being of people in the hands of untested ideology, unless you consider 19th century England or modern day Somalia models for the United States. The ""Free Market"" is an idea, not a reality, and while regulation can be both corrupt and inefficient, some regulation is needed to protect the powerless from the powerful (see women's/minorities'/children's/gays' rights). Without regulation, the average business will not spend money to accommodate the disabled, for example, because the cost of doing so will work counter to the profit motive. In a vacuum of federal power, the states will not protect citizens from the abuses of power. 

2. He's naive. Forget the usual complaints that he's an isolationist. That's palatable to me. But he seems to believe that, absent regulation, companies and states will operate more efficiently than a federal government because of market forces. There's no evidence of that. Companies operate inefficiently all of the time (in some cases without negative fiscal consequences) and state politicians are as bad or worse in terms of corruption and stupidity than our federal representatives. Yet Paul seems to believe that state laws are mysteriously, inherently superior to federal laws. Why, he doesn't say. Paul would argue that ""the market"" would fix inefficiencies in unregulated corporations and powerful states but inefficiency and corruption are inherent in every single human enterprise since recorded history. We've already seen ""free markets"" in England, with less regulation than in the U.S., go to the dogs. 

3. He cherry picks. His vision of what the Founders wanted is, like most people with a political agenda, based on a narrow view of actual historical events. Certainly, the founders of the country lived in a time when there was less need for a strong central government, but they abandoned the Articles of the Confederation and implemented a central bank, something Paul seems adamantly against if it happens to be the Fed. 

4. He ignores human nature. While Paul rightly denounce politicians telling you what you can buy, ingest or otherwise do, his argument that people will be able to see for themselves what to do is misguided. On the one hand, I think he is rightly cautious about government influence over citizens. On the other, individuals in a ""free market"" America will be just as likely to deceive their fellow citizens as they are now. They will do so in groups and these groups will act as companies and political organizations. A nuclear waster disposal company, for example, could simply dump its waste on its own property without sufficiently protecting citizens who live nearby. The business will do what's best for it alone since there is no recourse otherwise. Perhaps some states would step into the void left by a weak federal government and regulate (if so, why is their regulation better? Just because it's a state reg?) but perhaps others wouldn't. The people born in those states think of their homes like a commodity that they can easily replace by moving to another state. 

5. He forgets that society is inevitably about sharing. He espouses strong property rights, and I agree with that, but in the context of his political vision property rights aren't enough to fill the gap of a radically scaled back government. Sure, I might protect my home, but when Joe Smith &amp; Co. use the adjacent lot to pollute my home town worse than can be done today, my property has suddenly become worthless. 

6. He loves the profit motive. But there's no evidence that the profit motive can't get out of hand. Not everything works through a simple supply/demand ratio. If private companies own and maintain the federal highways I drive to work on and then decide to charge me huge tolls, there is no way for me to choose a competing highway to get to work on. 

7.  He's for turning back gains for the gay community, like the Don't Ask reversal. His arguments against the Civil Rights Act basically come down to companies would treat blacks better if they were just allowed to go back to treating blacks how they want--an absurdity on its face. 

8. He's not a friend of the scientific community. The fact that he thinks global warming isn't a big problem is enough to demonstrate that he's a person who believes based on ""faith"" rather than evidence. As someone who has not spent years of his life studying the climate, how does he justify blowing off the concerns of around 95 percent of all climatologists worldwide? 

9. His crusade against the Fed is misguided. I agree that there should be more transparency and oversight of the Fed, but how would international trade work without a functioning central bank? It wouldn't work efficiently, certainly.

I could go on, but this is already way too long. Despite all of the above, I agree with many things Paul says. I think he adds to the debate and I think our current politically system is greatly in need of reform because of corruption among the powerful and wealthy, but I won't vote for him. One criticism I have of the supporters I've talked to is that they don't really want to get into the weeds of why they are right or wrong (the conversation is more on the level of everything the federal gov does is wrong because it's inefficient, period) or they miss the forest for the trees by overly focusing one area where the federal government is definitely inefficient. I've felt like I'm talking to people who don't question their beliefs much.

An individual trying to make something more of himself improves the world through his actions.

If Bob Senior works and struggles all his life, he is rewarded with wealth and success. This success helps the world around him.
Now, if Junior just gets a lump sum dropped on his lap with no additional effort or drive on his part, doesn't this short-circuit the entire goal? He has not proven himself to be more productive or more industrious. 

Also, I don't buy the double-taxation argument since we are dealing with two different earners. Bob Senior is taxed as he earns the money. But as soon as the money changes hands, it is a source of income for Junior. Junior has never been taxed on this income before. 

I just never understood the Republican vehemence against a tax that affects less than 1% of the population which just happens to be the wealthiest percentage.

Now, I'm not against an inheritance in its entirety. A family has a right support their children, but I feel the estate tax is one of society's only weapons against dynasty building.

""There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.""

It makes me uneasy because I feel that it is contrived. I feel uneasy because it threatens to become some kind of permanent arbitrary definition for Bostonians and those people in the region.

Yes I know 4 people died and over 100 were injured. The nature of those injuries (causing so many people to require prosthetic limbs) is particularly tragic. Just let me finish. This is no disrespect to those who were injured or their friends and families. They have my donations, respect, and empathy.

But Boston has always been a strong community, we don't need some media driven ""wear this Lance Armstrong bracelet"" appellation like some red badge of courage, just like we don't want a bunch of scantily clad, drunken sorority members wearing pink hats and liking Neil Diamond to represent the Red Fox fan base. We don't want a marketing team from national media dictating ""Boston Strong"" as a slogan for our region just as we don't want a marketing team from Larry Lucchino's pink hats saying that Manny Ramirez is their favorite current player on the Sox when in fact he is tearing it up in Taiwan.

We've always been an immigrant amalgamation of scrappy underdogs beating the hell out of each other - and banding together against outsiders in defense of our ""neighborhoods"" and communities and especially our sports teams! Adversity always binds people together (sad but true). We've always thrived on competition and rising above. I don't need some wrist band reminder of this because its part of our regional heritage.

The thing is, I was an adult when 9/11 happened. I watched NYC band together in the face of unprecedented horror of a scale that eclipses what happened here. I've been watching the news for 25 years as an adult and seen tragic aggressive acts bind people together or rip them apart. Adversity always shows the character of a community or people, but to me I never had a doubt of the character of Massachusetts residents. It feels slightly unsettling to have the attention of the nation turned to us and try to tell us what we already knew to our bones.

Ever since 9/11, no matter how many times I root against the Yankees and Jets, I will for the rest of my life respect the community of New York City. No matter how badly acts of mass destruction target good communities, I will remain loyal to the ideal that communities rally to almost any challenge. I just want what happened here to become a footnote within the worthy notable acts and reactions of Bostonians throughout our proud 380 years or more history. I refuse to be defined by it as a victim or marketing tool.

Horrific things occur to many good people around the globe. But those acts cannot define them. A raped person, or bombing injury survivor, or war refugee can have those actions help to explain part of who they are, but they can never be defined by that moment. When they assimilate that moment into themselves and it becomes another of dozens or hundreds of factors that help them define themselves as a whole human, that is what makes us rise above. When we get exposed to evil, learn from it and shape our reaction to it into just a facet of who we are, that is when we let a terrorist know they cannot win. That is why the ""Boston Strong"" movement needs to quell down. We are not defined by our reaction to these events. We were just that cool to begin with.

1360567858.0,42,self.PoliticalDiscussion,18aqvr,What if homicide is the only thing that gets us to take notice of injustice? ,58,16,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/18aqvr/what_if_homicide_is_the_only_thing_that_gets_us/,"Before I launch into my argument here, let me clarify that I *do not* in any way condone Chris Dorner's actions or the murdering of innocent people in general. This post might sound a little crazy, but bear with me. 

The media has a pretty short attention span, and it focuses the attention it does have on sensationalist issues. Something more undercover and behind-the-scenes - like say, a history of corruption in the LA police department - is never reported on and is therefore not in the public consciousness. And it will never be, because if it were reported on, people would dismiss it as ridiculous and un-newsworthy. Only a small number of people would care enough to listen to the report. 

What if the only way to bring attention to an issue like corruption, abuse, and racism in the LAPD is for someone like Chris Dorner to murder some people? And to make it even more sensationalist, murder one of the officers family members? What if Dorner was so pissed off about this abuse, and he realized *nothing would ever be done about it* if business carried on as usual. He realized that the *only* way for LAPD abuse to enter public consciousness is to do something shocking enough to register on the media's radar. And as we all know, tragedy is the currency of our media. It runs on fear: of crime, terrorism, disease, etc. Dorner realized that he has two options: 1. accept being fired from the police force, move on with his life and continue as a normal citizen, or 2. go batshit crazy and start murdering some people, writing a manifesto that drew attention to all the abuse that pissed him off. 

Perhaps there is an analogy with terrorism in the middle east as well. But my point is, that perhaps we as people are partly to blame for police brutality. We don't care or pay attention enough to realize it's happening and put a stop to it. *We* require the deaths of innocent people to sit up and take notice. What if we forced Dorner to either kill or be ignored? 

Break out of the normal mode of thinking, where you must either condemn Dorner for his actions or else you must support his actions. Some redditors have reached the more nuanced position of condemning his actions while understanding his reasons. But what I'm saying is be even more nuanced. Recognize that while you condemn his actions, and understand his reasons, you share some of the blame for the abuse. We are to blame because of our ignorance and lack of caring, and we should recognize that we essentially forced Dorner into this choice of murdering or letting the injustice continue. 

Another possibility though is that Dorner *perceived* that murder was the only way to bring attention to his cause, although that is not the case, there are other ways he could have drawn attention.

If the system is so broken, why don't we fix it?


X-Posted answer:

I liked your post. Shame you removed it. Repost it in PoliticalDiscussion for greater traction.

I know this has been said many times in many different ways but it bears repeating. In my opinion, the ""why"" of your questions can be answered by, ""Because it's difficult to effect change when there are SO MANY INCENTIVES to keep the system the way it is."" The vast majority of the population is just not informed enough to know that they are being unfairly exploited. They are still convinced that talking heads on TV or anyone ""in charge"" is altruistic and wants the best for them. This is the biggest lie that the ideologues have fed the population. Regardless of which ""side"" the schmuck happens to be on almost every capitalistic incentive is rigged to exploit something and to extract these resources towards the top of the wealth chain. All ""sides"" do this but some of them at least have a semblance of charity and remove these spoils less quickly than others.

The political/corporate hegemony has set up the current context we live in (sub-standard public education, propped-up economy, two-tiered justice system, maximization of debt service... and so on) to keep the masses just this side of subservience. The masses only appear lazy because they are so busy keeping their own lives from spiraling out of control. They are not lazy. They are gullible and being exploited by those whose sole purpose is to keep the inequality in place. Working 3 jobs to feed yourself and your family takes A LOT OF ENERGY. Making sure your kids gets picked up after school and dropped of at your sister's so you can wait tables at night squanders A LOT OF TIME. 

Those who struggle have a hard time to do anything other than keep struggling. It keeps the exploited exactly in their place. 

The whole ""how"" of fixing the busted system will be a real slog. Those we trusted to be competent have failed. Those we believed were benevolent were crooks. Ultimately it will likely take a combination of education (like talking to your family and friends), courage (by standing up to those that intentionally distort truth), guidance (learning from others who share your concerns), and support (lending a hand to the less fortunate).

Don't give up.

Al Gore mentioned the Electoral College in his speech, and advocated a Constitutional Amendment. However, there's a bill passing through state legislatures right now that's almost halfway to getting rid of the EC--no amendments necessary!

The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is a bill that may well be in front of your state legislatures right now, and its goal is to replace the Electoral College with the popular vote. Each state that agrees to it also agrees that, once 50% of all electoral votes are represented by states that have signed the NPVIC, all of those states will agree to give their electoral votes to the popular vote winner.

The states I mentioned in the title have already passed the bill, and others are reviewing it now. The first signer, Maryland, adopted it in April 2007 and today the bill is 48.9% of its way to the magic number of 270 electoral votes represented by its signers.

The fact that this much ground has been made against an age-old institution in just five years gives me hope that if we spread the word and let our state legislators know how we feel about it, we can look forward to the popular vote in 2016.

Write your state legislators and any new candidates, and ask them where they stand on the NPVIC, and whether they'd vote for it. Call them out in public forums, on blogs, and in letters-to-the-editor in your local paper.

If you'd like, here's a template I've written up. Feel free to use it as is or edit it to your preferences:



""Dear ____________, 

I am inquiring as to your stance on the Electoral College. I see it as anti-democratic and urge you to work to pass the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact should you make it into office (here, I'll remind you that, according to an October 24, 2011 Gallup poll, 62% of Americans would swap the Electoral College for the popular vote).

Why the Electoral College Must Go:

• It devalues the national popular vote; 

• It gives disproportionate influence to the relative handful of states where the statewide outcome is most uncertain (i.e. ""swing"" states).

• It discourages voter turnout; 

• It gives money an undeserved advantage over grassroots support, since money can more easily travel across state lines to influence the outcome of the election in swing states.

Again, if you receive the support of the people, I urge you to pass the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.  It's what we want, after all.

Sincerely,

This lead to the largest protests at our Capitol since Massive Resistance, the movement against desegregation.  Clearly, there's a lot of passion on both sides of this issue.  It's also something that people will very rarely change their minds on, once they've decided a position for themselves.

That's why, instead of keeping the fight about 'abortion should be legal,' I think pro-choice groups should go on the offensive and begin pushing for extended paid parental leave, daycare assistance, infant nutrition assistance, pre- and neonatal care.  Basically, reducing the costs of having a baby will reduce the *need* for abortions.

This puts pro-life groups in a bind, because they're usually right wing and this is socialism.  However, if they're against these measures, they would then be clearly not 'pro-life' but 'anti-choice'.  If they're against these measures, then it becomes clear that they want to make abortions illegal to punish women, and not because they have any care for possible babies.  This would cost them support, especially the truly compassionate.

On the other hand, if pro-life groups were to embrace these ideas, it could open the discussion towards strengthening *other* social safety nets as well.  It could lead to a new era of sanity in our politics.

A theory of the mechanics of the U.S. ‘propaganda system’ was outlined by Herman and Chomsky in their [propaganda model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_model). The theory has its critics, but Chomsky identifies a couple prominent American thought leaders that, in the early 1900’s, basically argued that propaganda is necessary to maintain the continuity and function of a democratic society. These were [Walter Lippmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Lippmann) (intellectual and political commentator) and [Edward Bernays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays) (public relations specialist), and their ideas are still relevant today.

While propaganda is rarely discussed in reference to the U.S., it’s hard to deny its serious role in American society - times before and during military actions are probably the starkest examples. And while Herman and Chomsky do a fine job presenting dangers of propaganda as it typically favors elite opinion while largely ignoring the masses, I believe Lippmann and Bernays offer arguments of their own that are worth considering.

Below is a quote from Bernays' [Propaganda (1928)](http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf) - Lippmann’s thoughts on propaganda can be found in his book [Public Opinion (1922)](http://www.faculty.english.vt.edu/Collier/5314/lippmannpublicop.pdf):

&gt;In theory, every citizen makes up his mind on public questions and matters of private conduct. In practice, if all men had to study for themselves the abstruse economic, political, and ethical data involved in every question, they would find it impossible to come to a conclusion about anything. We have voluntarily agreed to let an invisible government sift the data and high-spot the outstanding issues so that our field of choice shall be narrowed to practical proportions.

On a related note, Lippmann expressed concern that without a filter on information, “there would be a certain group that felt sufficiently alike to be classified together” while “there would be variants of feeling at both ends [of the spectrum].”

Lippmann continues:

&gt;These classifications would tend to harden as individuals in each of the classifications made their reactions vocal. That is to say, when the vague feelings of those who felt vaguely had been put into words, they would know more definitely what they felt, and would then feel it more definitely.

Both Lippmann and Bernays essentially believed that propaganda is a glue that holds back the potential chaos of the masses and keeps a democratic society together in the absence of absolute leadership.

This leads to the question in the title of this post:

**Is it in a democratic society’s interest to be subjected to propaganda in order to bring about consensus regarding complex and potentially divisive issues?**

But there are two other questions I would like people to think about:

**1) Could the U.S. maintain a high standard of productivity without propaganda and with a highly-informed public?**

**2) How does the decentralization of media via the internet affect the realm of propaganda?**

Edit (1): fixed minor typos

Edit (2): To clarify, I'm not using ""propaganda"" in a inherently negative way. For instance, propaganda in this sense could be used to persuade people to support environmental protection issues, and it could be used to rally the public for war against Iran. My question related to propaganda is regarding cases when a person must diligently explore an issue before making an informed opinion.

Edit (3): I recognize the U.S. isn't a democracy. By ""democratic societies"" I meant states with democratic/electoral processes.

If you asked me a year ago, I would say not a chance. But after review campaign spending by Dems in 2012 (read, lack of spending), Perry's insistence on not expanding Medicaid and the explosion of low-paid workers in TX, I have read some interesting stuff that suggest that it should at least move into the purple range. 

From the numbers I have found, O's campaign spent less than 3 million in Texas. I couldn't find numbers but that must be around the lowest campaign spending/eligible voter of any state in the country. That ~3 million got him 41.4% of the vote. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas,_2012

The popular vote was won by less than 10% of the total number of eligible voters. 
http://elections.gmu.edu/Turnout_2012G.html

These numbers are insane. 
55% of Texans are minority. Every year you can add more or less a percentage point to that. Now of course, 55% of eligible voters aren't minorities, but still significant. (I couldn't find numbers for this)

So I guess another way to ask my question is; If the Dems decided to spend as much money per eligible voter in Texas in 2016 as the did in Nevada, could they swing it? (5.94 in nevada).
That would leave nearly 100 million bucks to spent on get out the vote campaigns, voter registration drives and so. 
Also, if the Dems started spending money like this, that would destroy the GOPs ability to spend that money it the more traditional swing states. 
Am I just seeing what I want to see and what I hope to be true, or does this make sense?

These were his major points:

* Obama has blamed everything wrong with the world on the Republicans in Congress, making the republicans not want to work with him
* Obama blames the economy he inherited solely on the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress between 00-08 , where the Democrats voted for the same wars, the same economic policies, and made no/little attempt to stop them. Basically the Democrats had just as much to do with the recession as the Republicans did, and now Obama is acting like the Democrats have acted like saints the entire time even up until now.
* Obama has failed to uphold bipartisanship in congress (points to Obamacare, Stimulus, etc....)
* Obama's overall leadership skills are weak regardless of his attempts to compromise
* Obama's immigration policies are terrible
* Obama's Libya response was in-excusable
* Obama has failed to recover the economy at a fast enough rate

-- edit for clarification: He stated that Romney would not fail on these points, and would be a much stronger leader, especially in congress.

When I asked him about what he thought about Romney not laying out any details for his plan, he stated something along the lines of: he is not providing any details because he wants to take the most pragmatic approach once in office, so he does not want to give out details that will alienate any particular group (sorry I just lol'd about the 47% just now) because he wants to appease everybody and knows that if he makes promises that are not realistic, he does not want to be held against them when in reality he is doing what he thinks is best.

This could easily happen because nowadays South Korea has a harsher stance towards North Korean actions. North Korea is invaded and a new more Western-friendly leadership is installed.

* 4) A large scale attack by some of the key players resulting in a full-scale war. Might be a nuclear attack by North Korea which results in at least one tactical nuke being fired by the American forces. Or it could be that North Korea fires artillery shells into Seoul. The end result is the same as in 3) - North Korea is invaded and a new leadership is installed, but this scenario might lead to more civil casualties.

We also know that he is in daily contact with Greenwald, somehow, securely. He was reported in the past as using Lavabit as a secure email provider. I think it is a fair bet to assume he is being heavily surveilled by multiple parties. In such a situation he is probably using encrypted communication tools of some sort. 


The recent pressure on Freedom Press and Lavabit seem to have originated simultaneously. The former was taken out by surprise last week by a combined technological and law enforcement attack. The latter was probably set in motion some short time ago, in the form of a gag order on the owner of Lavabit. We know he said he agonized over the decision to burn everything down, so the timeframes do seem to overlap to some degree.

In addition it was clear that an older version of the Tor browser bundle was specifically attacked by the malware attack used against Freedom Hosting users, plus Tormail specifically was taken completely offline. To be fair Tormail is notoriously unreliable anyway, but it honestly does seem as if there is a pattern to these shutdowns, and the common thread is Snowden and the NSA.

The NSA and related authorities are taking out high value targets while they still have the power and political capital to do so before potential reforms kick in after the current congressional recess. However these moves don't seem high value enough to be honest, and the media reaction has been largely suspicious and negative - especially with the Lavabit statement, which implied that they got no value from their demands there. Their political situation has been made weaker with these actions, and there clearly needs to have been a justification for it all.

2. For some reason they are trying to cut off Snowden from those he is in contact with outside Russia. That or they have recently uncovered evidence that he uses Tormail and/or Lavabit and wish to uncover what exactly he has been telling people. I suspect they will have access to Tormail server data soon if not already as pressure on the CEO of Freedom Hosting mounts in Ireland.

2.5. Moving into the realm of crackpottery here but Snowden is now in an incredibly vulnerable position. He may not have a clear line of contact to any of the press anymore, especially with the takedown of these popular encrypted services. He is not in a crowded airport, and is most likely in a relatively remote location, surrounded by state operatives. The Wikileaks handler's situation is unknown as well. Greenwald revealed recently that he received tens of thousands of leaked documents but importantly, only he and Poitras were given access. There have been persistent rumors of a dead mans switch but nothing definitive, as far as I can recall it may have stemmed from Greenwald's assertion that Snowden had ""taken measures"" to protect himself. I think this whole sequence of events is ominous; it is the perfect moment for a transfer of Snowden to somewhere he won't be able to communicate to the public from, or where his actions will become involuntary. I'm not talking about a commando raid, more on the scale of a quiet prisoner transfer  to agents that operate outside the public eye.


Anyway this got too long, what do you think of it all?

EDIT: Correction - Lavabit's CEO Levison said he was struggling with the decision for ""6 weeks"".

EDIT: should be ""Freedom Hosting"", my mistake, was late. I'm going to start including elaborations and more pertinent info in bullet form below.

* The warrant for Marques's  (CEO of Freedom Hosting) arrest was issued from Maryland and apparently was the culmination of a year long collaboration between Irish and American law enforcement.
* Snowden was quoted by Greenwald in a new article this morning, and the quote was meant to be from the same day and directly addressed Lavabit, so clearly they are still able to communicate.

This is, of course, a question in context of the [collapse of the a garment factory in Bangladesh,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22334240) which supplied clothes to Western consumers.  

If the US government mandated certain standards that have to be adopted by all retailers selling clothing, this seems like it would have the effect of immediately forcing all the ""sweatshops"" currently in operation to revamp their factories, improving safety and work standards and whatnot. It also seems like it would avoid the problem of regulation coming from the host country, since that tends to increase the cost of doing business and thus incentivizes capital flight to countries with less regulations and lower standards; since the regulation is on the demand-side, and not the supply-side, companies won't be able to lower the standard of work below a certain level.

In terms of prices, I suppose they might go up; but on the other hand, they might not increase by all that much if the various retailers care about maintaining market share.  After all, if they raise the prices to preserve their profit margins on each item sold, they'll probably sell less, and thus lose out on the aggregate profit.  

On the other hand, if the costs associated with making sure of the standards runs too high (since usually its sub-contractors, not the actual companies, that run the factories), it might actually create capital flight *back* to developed countries, where its easier to abide by the regulations.  

What do you think?  It seems like a decent idea to me, and I'm not sure why liberals don't try to push for this kind of thing, instead of targeting individual companies.

Our public school system has all but forsaken children victimized by bullying.  Anyone feel like sounding off on this issue?",50,15,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/19su9n/12yoboy_has_died_from_a_bullying_attack_meanwhile/,"12-year-old Bailey O'Neil recently died after being physically attacked by a bully and being placed in a medically induced coma.  In Florida, a student was recently suspended for forcibly disarming an armed student who had threatened another student with a loaded handgun.

Bullying has become such an issue that documentaries have been released, awareness programs have been instated and celebrities have decided to champion anti-bullying efforts.  Even the government has stepped in and become involved, creating stopbullying.gov, a website created for the purpose of advising parents, and fellow students of what to do when their children or fellow students are being bullied.

In spite of all the attention, the only people that aren't truly being helped, advised or protected are the victims of bullying.  Stopbullying.org is a great resource for those *indirectly* affected by bullying.  One site that advises parents on school matters wrote an article on whether or not a parent should teach their child to defend themselves.  Claims like ""We have to treat everyone equally, victim and aggressor alike,"" and "" In some instances bullying is a cry for help,"" were the general tone of the advice given by the author.

My dad taught me how to fight when I was a kid.  He also taught me never to use my fists to humiliate or bully anyone.  He also taught me restraint, ensuring I knew excessive force had no place in a relatively benign fistfight.  But long-term what I learned from the ability to take care of myself was self-respect, healthy boundaries, confidence, self-reliance and self-worth.  The same things kids lose when they are bullied.

By schools doing nothing more to combat bullying than encouraging an unimaginative, half-assed awareness and reporting program, and punishing kids that take action, what are they teaching kids about life?  Inadvertently teaching them that nothing in life is *ever* worth fighting for?  That they should always rely on others to keep them safe?  Or that they should fear confrontation, which is just a fact of everyday human life?  And why is it that every citizen in America has the right to defend themselves at all times, unless they're a student attending school?

When/how will schools learn that kids fighting is a normal part of growing up, development and life?  And that as such, they can't realistically expect to keep punishing victims and stifling kids' basic human urge (and right) to defend themselves from a violent physical attack?

TL; DR:  Schools' habit of punishing and disempowering victims of bullying is ruining our kids' lives, treating our kids like second-rate citizens, and is still doing nothing to fix the problem.

If I understand the debate correctly, isn't the Republican position that by raising taxes on the rich, they will pay more money in taxes, leaving less money available to hire people?  Thus, job growth will slow, which directly harms our economy. 

If you close loopholes and deductions instead, as Republicans want (and Romney advocated and lost) won't this also result in the rich person paying more money in taxes, thereby hampering job growth and so on?

What difference does it make to a rich ""job creator"" how he or she ends up paying more in taxes, if this is in fact the case?

If it's supposed to be self-evident that closing deductions will not result in the rich paying higher taxes, since this is the Republican plan to help lower the deficit, isn't the inescapable conclusion that it is the middle and lower classes who will provide the extra revenue?  If this is so, then how could the Republican plan enjoy any kind of support at all? I've certainly never seen it reported this way so I don't think this is supposed to be the position.

Now, this never really made sense to me and I'll tell you why: the fact that the USA was bombing Tokyo on a regular basis with thousands of tonnes of bombs means that Japan's air force and navy were completely subdued by that point. The United States had freedom of action in the skies and the Japanese navy was mostly sunk. Add to that, they were under embargo by the US and had a chronic oil shortage.

Now, this sounds like a country whose days are numbered, regardless of how you look at it. Japan was already in surrender negotiations via the Soviet Union by May of that year when it was clear that Germany was kaput. 

After reading [an interesting article](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html) it shed some light on the chronology of the events and gave me some new information that I didn't know. Some interesting direct quotes from military men are also intriguing to read: 

&gt;General Douglas MacArthur, Commander of US Army forces in the Pacific, stated on numerous occasions before his death that the atomic bomb was completely unnecessary from a military point of view: ""My staff was unanimous in believing that Japan was on the point of collapse and surrender.""

and 

&gt;Admiral Leahy, Chief of Staff to presidents Roosevelt and Truman, later commented:

&gt;""It is my opinion that the use of the barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan ... The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons ... My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.""

The most ironic part of the whole situation is that Truman was insisting on an unconditional surrender and the Japanese were worried about the emperor being tried as a war criminal. After Japan capitulated on Aug. 15, they decided to keep the emperor as a ceremonial figure, as he was widely respected by the Japanese at the time and would help legitimize the occupation. 

I've come to the conclusion that although the Japanese troops were portrayed (sometimes rightfully) as fanatical and suicidal, the leadership was a rational one that understood the increasingly isolated position of their country towards the end of WWII. With Soviet troops flowing across their borders in Manchuria, there was no chance of winning.

I believe the US had only built 2 working nukes after the [Trinity test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_test) and wanted to use them as soon as possible. They could have picked other military targets but they chose two cities with mostly civilian populations. Ultimately I think these people were killed in order to demonstrate US military power to the Soviets and any other country that would try to challenge them.

I know it's a controversial topic and it happened a long time ago, but since there's a lot of talk about possible nuclear weapons proliferation today, we should look back at the only example of their use in warfare.

Most want government to provide single-payer health care, to spend more tax money on education, to spend more tax money on green energy, on infrastructure, on all sorts of things.  At what point, though, is government ""big enough""?  Do you want complete government control of everything?  If the answer is ""no"", then please delineate clearly your criteria for when you think government is big enough.

As an added corollary to this question, of course as government gets bigger, its power also grows.  A government that owns everything also has total power over everything.  So at what point is government ""too powerful""?  And how do you reconcile having a government that is too powerful with having a government that is too big?

Please be specific in your responses.

EDIT; Most people don't seem to be actually addressing the question.  Maybe I was not clear.  So let me use the EPA as an example.  Most commenters say they want the EPA to become more powerful.

We are determined that our government remain warmly responsive to the urgent social and economic problems of our people.

Is what was considered politically ""conservative"" in the 80s, considered middle of the road now?",70,35,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1aj28j/has_the_us_actually_become_more_conservative_over/,"I see this as an oft-cited ""common wisdom"" a good amount on reddit, other sites, and most non-Fox media.  I hear all the time that most of the democrats in congress now would have been republicans in the 80s, that Obama's ""liberal"" policies now were formerly centrist positions.   I THINK it's a fairly common position, so I don't feel compelled to find sources to support it, so if people think I'm all wet here, let me know.

I feel it's something that I've seen/heard a good amount, and I can't fathom how anyone can actually believe this.

In the last 30 years, it appears that this country has become exceedingly more liberal socially.  In fact, opposite of ""conservative views"" from the 80s becoming ""middle of the road views"", it is ""liberal"" views becoming ""middle of the road"" (e..g, gay marriage, loosening of marijuana laws, debating the legality of abortion no longer being a legitimate issue.  I can't think of an issue that the country has become more conservative on socially in the last 30 years except maybe immigration (which probably isn't even a social issue anyway) as a result of all the post 9/11 hysteria and poor economy.

So, if it's not more conservative socially, is it more conservative fiscally?  Well, no - at least not when it comes to spending.  We have a trillion dollar deficit.  Government spending as a % of GDP was in the low 20s in the 70s and 80s and is up near 25-30% now [source](http://www.supportingevidence.com/Government/fed_budget_as_percent_GDP_over_time.html).  Taxes as a percent of of GDP, definitely declined from the 80s [source](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Tax_Receipts_as_a_Percentage_of_GDP_1945%E2%80%932015.jpg), but that could arguably be due to the recession(s) since you see it spike up during the 90s and down during the two chasms of the 2002 and 2008 recessions.  And when people make the statement that we are getting more conservative, I don't think they are exclusively talking about tax policy.

The government is certainly getting larger, and at least as it comes to commerce, getting far more authoritarian (increased involvement in medicare part D, while Obamacare is not a ""government takeover"" since it's moving people to private insurers, it's certainly government mandating behavior, thousands of new gun control laws).  Government is also becoming more authoritarian when it comes to wars, due process, surveillance,etc.

The intertwine between government and corporations is certainly increased - the ""crony capitalism"" that is all the rage, but I don't view that as a ""Conservative/Liberal"" or ""Republican/Democrat"" thing - if government wasn't so big, they wouldn't have the ability to hand out favors to their corporate donors - which both parties are equally at fault - so I'm at a loss as why so many people often repeat the statement that the US is getting so conservative.

edit:  ""right/conservative"" does not mean ""Republican"".  ""Left/Liberal"" does not mean ""Democrat""  There are many things that Republicans are doing (e.g. unfunded wars resulting in massive deficits) that are not ""right wing"" polices and there are many things Democrats are doing that are not ""left/liberal"" policies.

Sure there are a few corrupt politicians, but I believe they are the exception not the rule.
People always ask why congress can never get anything done, when they should be asking themselves why they never let congress get anything done. It was the voters who took a moderate Republican who was willing to work across the aisle and replaced him with a tea party candidate. It is voters who, in lieu of actually understanding the complexities of budgetary voting and parliamentary procedure vote against candidates because they voted for things they didn't actually vote for or voted for something that may have included a policy rider that wasn't the greatest. As long as politicians’ votes are exploited and extrapolated outside of their legitimate context, can you really blame politicians for living in fear of the next election cycle?

We always want compromise, but rarely do we mean compromise; what we really mean is the other person compromising in our favor.

It will be worse than Greece.

This means the GOP MUST cut a deal with Obama.  It is not the same as before, when the GOP held the cards on the debt ceiling.

In short, for the near term at least, Obama has his mandate, and if the GOP does not realize this, their own party may become fractured as moderate ""defectors"" split from their Tea Party fellows.

So effectively the Democrats need a super majority (60 votes) in order to get anything passed. One could argue that this is a double standard as Bush II got virtually everything he wanted without a super majority (in fact Dems consistently supported many of his policies, from the Iraq war to the Patriot Act.) But that's not my question. What I'm wondering is why a threat of a filibuster is enough for Dems to cave on an issue? Make them filibuster if they want to. I don't see the harm in that at all. Have the longest filibuster in history be on the backs of Republicans opposing a Job's Bill. Make them go for months on end, and force the debate.

1315184584.0,38,self.PoliticalDiscussion,k4uty,"Traffic statistics for /PoliticalDiscussion, observations, and ideas for growth",42,4,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/k4uty/traffic_statistics_for_politicaldiscussion/,"A reader asked about the subscriber statistics (or traffic) for /politicaldiscussion, considering the discussion ongoing discussion on the subject.  While anecdotal experiences and gut feelings are important, there is no substitute for cold hard data covering the full range of the subject in  question. So what follows is a screencap of the traffic statistics page for /politicaldiscussion taken a few minutes ago, with a brief explanation of the various statistics. 

* **[The traffic statistics for /politicaldiscussion](http://i.imgur.com/Ioe9r.png)**. 

On the graphs, 'uniques' are unique users, 'impressions' are page views, and 'subscriptions' are the number of readers who subscribed to this subreddit. 

Looking at uniques and impressions *per hour*, it follows a daily cycle common on reddit, with the lowest traffic in the early through mid morning, and several peaks and dips during the waking hours. Even at the quietest times of night, 25 people per hour are checking /politicaldiscussion.  In the busiest times, it's usually over 80 unique users per hour, often at or over 100 per hour. Keep in mind, these are not total users present at any time, but *new* users streaming in over the course of the day. For the total number of users every day, the following charts are more useful. 

Looking at uniques and impressions *per day*, the hourly peaks and valleys are smoothed out, but there is a fluctuation within every week, and a fluctuation over the weeks. It is very clear on these charts when /politicaldiscussion was linked and promoted in /politics; the numbers significantly increased. The best ways to promote growth in a subreddit are to have promotion in similar subreddits, and to get it linked in the sidebar (more on that below). In the past several weeks, the number of unique users checking out /politicaldiscussion are almost always over 1,000 *per day*. This number is generally higher than the number of people who actively participate, but these are redditors who are logged in, looking at the page. The average reader in /politicaldiscussion looks at 4.5 pages here per day. So while some have the perception that this subreddit is quiet, there are a significant number of readers for its size, and considering the relatively low number of new submissions daily, with an average of 4.5 pages viewed per user, readers *are* reading what you all are writing. (4.5 daily average of pages viewed per user is the daily mean of impressions divided by daily mean of uniques, found at the bottom of the 'weekly summary' statistic.)

For comparison, /politicaldiscussion is outperforming /liberal (a similar subreddit of similar size, albeit 1/3 larger in number of subscribers). Despite /liberal's larger subscriber number, it has *fewer* unique readers per day, and they do only 1.4 pageviews on average. And that subreddit is at an average level of activity for its size, meaning this subreddit is performing above average in activity. 

Looking at the green 'subscriptions' chart, the spike in subscriptions following the promotion in /politics is obvious, and without additional promotion it settled into a stable pattern of 20-30 new subscribers every day. These are 20-30 people every day who decide ""yes, I'd like to subscribe here"" and click the button to add it to their frontpage. So to the community that is here, don't put too much stock in the gut feelings of a few vocal members; there are far more of you than they say there are, and a small but steady stream of newcomers every day. 

* Observations: 

There is discord among a vocal few here, frustrated about the policies of /politics. The question at the core of this is whether people want *attention* or *discussion*. The name of this subreddit is not /politicalAttention... it's /politicalDiscussion. There are other subreddits for posting political news, posting political links, but few if any that have at their core the idea of *political discussion* above all else. This isn't a soapbox on a stage before a crowd of a half million or more, it's more like a hole in the wall coffee shop or pub, the kind of place politically-interested people got together for hundreds of years to air their observations and ideas among other politically-interested people. It's not a place for rhetoric and propagandizing, that's what the soapbox on the stage before hundreds of thousands is for. It's a place for discussion, among a small crowd of people interested in and capable of discussion.

* Ideas for growth: 

But the detractors of /politicaldiscussion are correct that the crowd is very small and could stand to grow. Growth of a subreddit is not magical, it takes work. If you're interested in a place for political discussion where all views are welcome and encouraged, get the word out. If you notice people lamenting the lack of discussion in subreddits with a hivemind on the left or on the right, or where memes flood everything, ask if people ever heard of /politicaldiscussion. Word of mouth. Getting /politicaldiscussion into the sidebars of other similar reddits is something the mods can and  should be doing. And finally, if you want people observing to join into political discussion, it helps to create an atmosphere where people want to join in. 

tl;dr - The traffic stats speak for themselves, about 1,000 unique redditors are checking out /politicaldiscussion every day, and they're reading the submissions you all are posting. Participation has remained stable the past three weeks, with a small but steady stream of subscribers daily, yet it can stand to grow. Growth requires work, getting the word out. A subreddit is nothing but the sum of its members, and the cost of participation is zero, so if you want something that's not here, bring it in. This is /political*discussion*, not /political*attention*, so if you're disappointed that fewer than 600,000 people are seeing your posts here, consider what you are really looking for. If you like the idea of political discussion but wish there were some more people to participate, get the word out, promote it in other subs whenever you see political discussion run afoul of the left-wing, right-wing, or 4chan-wing hiveminds.

But as much as we're aware of how much risk is avoided by using drones, is the problem with their decision making or is the problem with drones even existing?

You can't tell if a bomb was dropped from a drone or a jet. A bomb is a bomb. 

The only criticism I could ask for drone pilots is for there to be more accountability...but I wonder why we don't talk more about actual pilots themselves. 

Should we only rely on jets?

Should we even drop bombs?

Do you even support special operations missions against targets? 

What degree of US military intervention do you support by any degree?

I should also mention this. As much as the wikileaks dump made the West look incredibly bad, it also changed some of my perspective of these wars. Many leaks showed that several countries were harboring terrorists and many of these strikes did lead to the kill and capture individuals who had been wanted for a long time. It also showed that several countries were actively misleading the US military and harboring terrorist groups. Diplomacy is a tricky thing and I never see it approached on internet forums with attention to detail but rather hyperbolic language meant to shut down any serious discussion of the issues themselves.

There are probably just as many crazies on the democratic side, but they don't manifest so outrageously and the democrats don't let them direct the party. If you want any credibility, you will have to take it back from the lunatics or gather up the other moderates and those that realize that good government almost invariably springs from compromise to form a new party.

If we could gather a party dedicated to reason and take back our culture and government, we would be truly great again. What it would do:

Keep a lid on union shenanigans without making corporations citizens. Keep gun ownership legal while doing our best to keep them out of the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable. Ensure everyone enjoys the same rights under the law without judging those who represent the extremes of our culture or those who disapprove of those extremes. Ensure fair taxation and compensation for everyone at every level of the social and financial ladder. Properly fund the education of the children that will continue to build and innovate long after we are gone. Help the poor and unfortunate back to their feet and remove the inadequacies in the system that penalize success and foster the inaccurate stigmas of laziness and dependency. Keep the country and military strong without sacrificing the lives, voices or freedom of anyone we would have them protect. Welcome everyone no matter what religion they practice, no matter the gender they call themselves or find attractive, no matter the color of their skin or the country they came from.

EDIT: I should point out that I have been previously accepted for private insurance through Blue Cross (as of April 2012, when I didn't have insurance through an employer and shortly before my 26th birthday), and it would seem that the medical underwriting policies they have in effect are different 6 months later.  I should also point out that in my particular case, I am in counseling and on medication simultaneously, and that is the criteria which was used to deny my coverage.

What about Demand-Side economics? Here's a short list of the basic ideas as I see them. Please add your own thoughts.

1. **There's only *one* job-creator: Demand.** A business will never invest or create more jobs if there is no demand.

2. **Recession = too little demand.** The ""uncertainty"" everyone keeps talking about is a result of too little spending by consumers. 

3. Help the economy by putting more money in the pockets of consumers, not suppliers. **Lower taxes on spenders**: lower payroll taxes and sales tax to increase demand.

4. **Capital Gains taxes should be raised.** Investors don't need tax incentives to invest in a profitable deal.

5. **Simplify the tax code, end silly loopholes, cut corporate welfare to established industries.** Tax avoidance shouldn't be a profit-center. Lobbying shouldn't bring a bigger ROI than your core business. If your industry has attained an economy of scale, and you still need tax breaks to be profitable, you're not a viable business.

6. **An investor class with too much money, coupled with a consumer class with too little money, creates bubbles.** Any investment sector which has some gains quickly becomes deluged with investors. But that sector cannot sustain profits to all those investors without consumers who will buy that product. Over-supply and too little (or debt-driven) demand results in a bubble, then a crash. 

7. **Good regulations** protect consumers, making them more confident about spending money.

8. In a recession, good business opportunities are scarce, leading investors and businesses to pull back. Only one entity, the government, can act as a counter-cyclical weight to goose demand during a recession. Hence, the **government should run surpluses during a boom, and run reasonable deficits during a recession.**

Can we make a basic Demand-Side philosophy part of the debate in this country? What does Reddit think?


Cheers,

Muzz


TLDR: Demand is the only job-creator. Lower taxes on consumers, raise taxes on investors. Simplify the tax code. Too much capital and too little consumption creates bubbles. Good regulation is good for the economy. Gov't creates demand during recession. Talk amongst yourselves.
