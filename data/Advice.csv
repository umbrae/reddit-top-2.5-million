1350517372.0,91,self.Advice,11nqmo,Should I trust my girlfriend at this point? ,112,21,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11nqmo/should_i_trust_my_girlfriend_at_this_point/,"Hey reddit, first thing is first, this is not about cheating or anything, I trust her 100% in that aspect.

The problem is she is suicidal. Or at least was, this is where I am unsure.

She often gets depressed and says things like ""You don't love me"" and ""Everyone would be better if I was dead"" She hates her body even though shes too skinny for her own good (read: 20lbs underweight). 

Yesterday she sent me a text telling me that she tried to drown herself, but she woke up from a nose bleed in the tub and got out and just started crying. I told her I was there for her but she kept saying ""You just don't understand. I need someone who does"" She also found out that one of her friends was in the ICU for overdosing on drugs (also a suicide attempt, I have no idea if the two are related). She was talking about how ""everyone's life sucks and I am poison.""

Then out of nowhere she said ""I love you. Never forget that. It will get better, I promise.""

then ""Be strong for me""

and ""Can I ask you something? Can you pray for me or something?""

All the while I'm saying things like ""Babe please stop. Im worried""

while shes saying ""You dont need to worry, everything will work out. I promise I will not die tonight. I am 100% okay""

This morning she texted me saying ""I'm at school, I'm fine."" I asked if she was okay and she said ""yeah, im just fone dont worry"" then she said that she threw up three times in class because she was ""nervous and scared"" and when i asked why she was scared she said ""just nothing""




I honestly feel like her and this guy planned on killing themselves that night, I want to ask her but I told her that I would stop worrying if she swore to god she would not kill herself, which she did.


**I think its about time I updated this!**

* It turns out 99% (if not everything) my now ex GF has ever told me was actually a lie. She has never hurt herself save a few incidents years ago. This other guy does not even exist. Her mother is not abusive in the slightest (I was told this) And her attempts of suicide were a lie. She told me she was sexually abused. This was not true. She called and told me that she took a lot of pills and I called 911, they later informed me that she did not and she just said that. Needless to say I was furious, we are thankfully broken up. She tried to start the rumor that our relationship was abusive, thankfully it never spread. Her friends occasionally text me asking if I like [insert random girls name here] and they meditatively start talking shit about her like this:


Rach: Hey do you like Katya?

Me: Not particularly, why do you even care?

Rach: Because she was spreading shit about X saying she was so ugly


At this point I told her to fuck off because Katya is the most mature girl I know

 
* Recently My ex told me she would be in the hospital for Christmas break and she was really sad, I would have believed it if I didn't see her in the mall boxing day. I have a shirt of hers which I want to give back, but I'm starting to conciser tossing it because I just want to be done with her.


* All in all I know im changed for the better and feel like this was a nessisary part in my life, I'd never repeat it for any reason but now that its done I guess i'm glad it happened!


**Thanks for all the support reddit, I've gotten plenty of PM's and all the support means a lot. I would really like to extend my thanks to one particular member of the community, raisedaslave, because she has helped me every step of the way and I honestly do think I would a) be in a much worse position and b) require therapy if not for her. Thank you so much raisedaslave!** Hope you like what i sent you for Christmas!

1333843218.0,41,self.Advice,ryji4,My workout,95,54,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ryji4/my_workout/,"Okay, so I have been getting a lot of requests about my workout since posting my weight lifting album. To be honest, though, I don't have a specific routine or schedule that I stick to every day, I just kind of go with it. It also depends on how much time I have and whether I'm focusing on a certain body area, etc. 

**Running:** I cannot stress enough how important it is to have running as part of your routine. Not only does it help you tone, it is a *full body* workout that also helps increase your endurance/cardio. I am a long distance athlete, so I go about 6-10 miles a day...try starting out with one mile and gradually increasing your distance, or going 20 mins your first day, then 30, etc. I would recommend running outside rather than on a treadmill, too...you get to enjoy the scenery, take new routes, it burns more calories, and it's a lot more motivating (you have a distance goal in mind rather than just being able to quit and hop off.) Cardio workouts also help shed weight. Remember that it's important to focus on losing fat weight before focusing on gaining muscle.

**Lifting:** I'm just going to be honest...I have not been to the gym in several months and have never regularly attended. I used to bench press and do bar squats all the time, but I decided not to include a gym membership in my budget. So now I just have my fellow dumbbells. I start with 15 lbs and work my way up to 35s; just alternating between hammer curls, regular curls, laterals, and push press. Don't forget tricep extensions! I work out my legs with dumbbells with lunges (back/forth) and dumbbell squats. 

**Abs:** Many people have recommended P90X to me, but I haven't tried it yet. Not that I'm opposed, it's just like I said: I'm a spontaneous person, and I've simply never planned my workout routines before. Anyway, some of my ab exercises are pick-pockets (sit on your bottom with knees bent and feet up, and move your hands from hip to hip), leg lifts, reverse toe touch, suitcases, reach-throughs, and, of course, sit ups/crunches. Remember that little kettlebell in my pictures? I hold it to my chest while I do sit ups: the extra weight makes more of a difference than you think, even if it's just a small weight. *Important:* Make sure you are holding the weight tight against your chest the whole time! If you use your arms to move it forward, you are simply using the weight to help lift yourself up haha.

**Other:** Push ups and pull ups are also key. Don't forget about the different variations though...warm up with wide push ups, then do regular, and finish with diamonds. Same with pull ups: make sure to alternate between regular and front pull ups and close/wide/regular grips. If you are just beginning to work out, pull ups might take awhile; don't be discouraged! To help get your first few, ask someone to help spot you, or start out using the flexed arm hang. Let's seeeee what else...I am also a part-time lifeguard, so I swim some laps during the summer. Also full body and long distance, but a surprisingly different work out than running. It's a lot harder for me. 

Hope this post answered a lot of your questions! Feel free to comment or PM if you want to know more!",,False,,t5_2qjdm,True,,,True,t3_ryji4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ryji4/my_workout/,

How do I minimize making it suck for others?,50,12,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/18sngv/im_killing_myself_tomorrow_how_do_i_minimize/,"I'm killing myself tomorrow, largely because I've done some selfish things that have ruined the lives and caused non-trivial financial damage to people that I love.  Underlying depression also obviously a factor.  I know that this will be another trauma I deliver to these people but I truly believe it's for the best and will save them long-term grief and give them closure from what I've done to hurt them.  My questions:

(1) Is there anything in the note that would be particularly comforting for them?  I would not be bullshitting them to convey how much I care and want them to be happy, the only thing I can't honestly say is that I did my best not to hurt them.
(2) I have my dog with me and need to see that she gets back to my partner.  There's a no-kill SPCA in the area that opens in the morning, which is why I'm not going through with it until tomorrow.  Is it better to have them call him to come get her, which seems so impersonal, or make a call to my partner right before and haunt him with my last spooky phone call? Yes, I realize both options suck, but they are the only ones on the table.
(3) Don't want to overly inconvenience law enforcement either, so would prefer to give some advance notice before anyone tries to launch a costly pointless search for me. Is calling 911 to be like ""I'm killing myself"" a thing, and for any officers reading, is that how you would most like a suicide to be phoned in if one has to be?

Thanks. I'm in New England if that matters.  Bring on your downvotes and chants of ""do it,"" I know how Reddit generally works, but that's really not what I'm here for.

1367858129.0,32,self.Advice,1dsth5,10 Easy Steps for Being Awesome,38,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dsth5/10_easy_steps_for_being_awesome/,"It’s officially Graduation time. Many of you are getting a fancy piece of paper soon. If your school is awesome it will say “Level up: Life Skill AWESOME acquired”. For most of you it will just say your name and some words in Latin. Sucks to suck.

When I was an undergrad I remember looking forward to graduation so much. I thought to myself on a regular basis, “Just get through this. When it’s all done you’ll be able to make money and start your life”. By the time that day actually came, I was so underwhelmed with the college experience that I didn’t even bother to show up.

At least real life had started. And I was off to the races… Not really. I had to move back in with my mom because I hadn’t made any job plans and didn’t feel motivated to sign up for 2 more years of college. I basically spent a year screwing off before deciding I needed a Master’s Degree. With that degree I eventually ended up working at a college. Now, at 29 years old, I’m getting ready to leave to do something huge and I finally feel prepared for it because of the lessons I’ve learned here.

In the last 4 years I’ve met people who are in their early 20s who I consider peers and equals; people who organize groups, throw giant successful events and still have time to kick school’s ass; people who study abroad for months at a time (and sometimes decide not to come home);  people who make these crazy life altering decisions and go through so much pain for the sake of upholding a benevolent idea. I’ve learned a little bit from every single one of you. And I need you to know something else: You’ve changed my life. Just watching you do what you do has given me so much excitement about the world. You taught me the value of college just a few years late.

There are some of you who might be wondering what the value of your education is. You still might be in school. You still might be trying to figure out what it is you’re going to do with your life. I learned a lot about that these last 4 years. I noticed that everyone who was kicking ass had a few things in common and as I get ready to leave and attempt to spread the gospel of “Be Awesome” I’d like to share what I saw in them as a doctrine for excellence.

And so I give you the 10 commandments of Being Awesome:

1) Be a dork.
A person who confidently and assertively loves dungeons and dragons is always cooler (and somehow more attractive to the opposite sex) than a person who wears a snapback and gets hammered for the sake of trying to look cool. It’s been amazing for me to realize that some of the most confident and respectable people are, in their heart of hearts, nerds that don’t give a shit if you call them nerds. Pay close attention to the people who you admire for doing extraordinary things. They are only able to do those things by breaking the boundaries of what is deemed as “normal”.


 
2) Say YES to new things.
This was my single biggest failing as an undergrad. I didn’t join clubs because I didn’t want to feel like the new kid/outsider. I didn’t want to dance because I might look silly. I turned down hundreds of opportunities to do what was comfortable and ended up missing the boat entirely. If you’re going to be excellent you have to know who you are and what you offer. If you want to know who you are and what you offer, you have to figure out what you like and don’t like. If you want to find out what you like and don’t like, you have to try EVERYTHING you get access to. That all starts by saying Yes. The most excellent people at any college are involved in a few things. They understand the opportunities they’re missing if they just go to class and call that their education.


 
3) Don’t take criticism personally
EVERYONE who I saw accomplish something big these last 4 years was told in the beginning that what they wanted to do was not possible. In every situation I saw whoever was about to do something great say “fuck the haters. I’m doing it anyway” and then proceed to create something unbelievable. When someone says something is impossible, they mean it’s impossible for them. If you have a vision, break their rules. Break them often and don’t feel guilty. 


 
4) Embrace Failure.
For every good idea there are 10 bad ones. The key is to let bad ideas go and focus on the positives you’ve built. It’s cliche to say but failures aren’t people who fail. Failures are people who fail and feel sorry for themselves instead of going back to the drawing board with the lessons they’ve learned. Every awesome person I’ve met here has failed numerous times. The interesting thing is you’d never know it. Instead of whining about it on twitter, they went back in the lab and reformatted their ideas.

 

5)Drink less.
And smoke less weed. Sure you have to be social and casual beers are a way to get there. I’ll admit that many of the cool things that I’ve done here in the last few years were dreamed up over beers and bullshit. I’ll even concede that going out and getting hammered once in a blue moon is your right as an American. However, basing your life around getting messed up is like stopping time while continuing to get old. When you wake up, it’s astounding to see how much time has been lost. I’ve never met anyone who talks about getting wasted all week and lives an excellent life at the same time.


 
6) Give everyone a chance.
I always had a hard time with this because I always wanted to be seen with the “cool” kids in hopes of grabbing some of their status. I noticed something interesting about the people I consider to be excellent – they hang out with everyone. They have the oddest friends and they love them all. This gives them access to all sorts of strange worlds and social circles. Best friends come from strange and unexpected places so try not to judge anyone before you get to know them. This has a cool side effect too – when you try to see the positives in other people instead of judging them harshly, the voice that thinks other people are judging YOU harshly tends to shut up. I learned this just a couple of years ago from an 18 year old.


 
7) Stop listening to grownups.
At some point you know more about you than your parents do. Embrace that fact. Run with it. Listen, I can tell you from experience that when you’re about to do something awesome , your parents are going to try to talk you out of it. They do that because they’ve had to stop your stupid ass from sticking your finger in a light socket from the time your chubby little legs could get you there. They’re trained to think you’re going to do the wrong thing because, let’s face it, you’ve done that thing a lot and their meddling has saved your fragile ignorant life. At some point, though,  you become a grown up. That means that your decisions are actually worth pursuing. No one can tell you when that is. You just have to know. Don’t wait for a diploma or a job or a wife to prove to yourself that you’re capable of making decisions. My guess is that if you’re interested enough in this to be reading this far, you’re already there. Now go do something.

 

8)Help others instead of yourself.
This will be impossible until you get a handle on Number 6. Helping people does a lot. First, it fills a need for someone. Second, it reminds you that you are of some value to the world. Third, it puts value into the “community fund” which I’ll define as: People feeling good and connected. The value of that community fund is directly proportional to how easy it will be for you to be picked up on days when you feel like you’re out of gas. When you help yourself you’re only getting the first thing and the other 2 go untouched. As long as you can let other people help you, this is a much more sound investment. I do have to note that SO MANY people fuck this up. They call it karma or tit for tat and they want a reward for their good deed immediately. If you expect that, the thing doesn’t work because you’re not really helping someone else, you’re just trying to help yourself.


 
9) Don’t stop learning.
Most people stop learning around their sophomore year. Boredom has set in. They’re interested in grades and credits. If this is you, drop out of school immediately. Or at least utilize the other 4 million opportunities that college affords you by joining a club, taking up a new hobby, or better yet, going on a service trip. Learning has little to do with sitting in a classroom being talked at. I learned more in the last 4 years than I did in 6 years of higher education and I didn’t go to a single class except for when I was giving a lecture or playing pranks on Dr. Burch’s Human Sexuality Class. I learned all of it by meeting people who were interested in different things or collaborating on projects. The most engaged people I’ve met here were students who had side-hustles. They were using the school’s money to fund ski trips or climbing trips. They used the design labs to cook up their projects. They used the recording studio to record their band’s record. Oh and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM TRAVELED. College is a great place to get acquainted with the world through travel. Every awesome person I know utilized that opportunity. I firmly believe that if you don’t, you are wasting your time and money.


 
10) Life Starts Today
Above all else, you need to realize that you’re already the person you hope to become. Stop waiting. You might be 15 years old and you might be 40. Life starts today. Waiting for some day to come when someone else gives you a permission slip to live is a sure-fire one-way ticket to Sucksville. You want to know what happens in Sucksville? You spend your whole life doing a job you hate and waiting for your big break while watching TV and eating Chinese Food as a little treat once a week. Then you have a heart attack and die. Don’t go to Sucksville. It sucks there.

 


This stuff is easy. Being awesome doesn’t depend on your parents, or the amount of money you have, or what you’re good at. All you need to do is make the decision to behave in a manner that is more awesome. Saying yes is only a little different than saying no. Drinking less is just drinking less. It’s easy. If you can figure out how to stop listening to the voice in your head that is afraid of the unknown and instead say, “Fuck it, from now I’m gonna be awesome.” then you’ll be on your way to kicking ass in no time. I can actually guarantee that.



Your first order of business? Start with #8 and share this with your friends. You’ll be helping me a lot. Thanks!

Any advice would be appreciated. ",27,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xm2l1/my_little_sister_is_4_years_younger_than_i_am_she/,"EDIT 2: The mods of AskReddit decided it didn't fit in there, so they asked me to move it to /r/advice.
EDIT: Executive summary: Little sister accusing me of molesting her. I'm innocent. Help.

Dear /r/advice,

I come from a family of 5. I'm the middle child, with two sisters. One is 4 years older, one is 4 years younger. We'll call the older one Christine, and the younger one Meredith. My parents are Bill and Mary, and are both wonderful. There was no abuse, physically or otherwise, in my family that I know of. My dad never hit me or anything like that.

I'm 24, I dropped out of college a few years ago, moved around, worked odd jobs, met a couple special women, almost got married. All in all, I was pretty happy. Two years ago my health started declining rapidly. Cancer, some other fun crap. Finally, I had to have knee reconstructive surgery, and would be laid up for six to eight months. I decided to leave my job, move home, and finish college. I'm also starting my own small engineering firm, producing a few small products for niche markets I've come up with. My parents were very happy, and very welcoming. They like having me around, and this would mean I'd get to spend more time with my grandfather, who has less than a year to live.

My younger sister still lives at home, and upon hearing that I was moving back, told my parents that I had molested her repeatedly, from the time she was in 8 until she was 13 or 14. She demanded a lock on her door (not just a lock, a dead bolt), and asked my parents not to allow me to return home. They let me move back in anyway.

First off, I never, and I mean NEVER touched her in any way inappropriately. I don't bully her, I've never intimidated her. She hasn't provided any details on what she's accusing me of, at least that have been shared with me.

I thought, at least for a while, that her and I had a decent relationship. When we were kids, we were close. About 5 years ago, her attitude towards everything and everyone changed. She, according to her own admissions, hates everyone in the family except my dad. I tried to be nice, and supportive, as big brothers should be, but that got me nothing but one word responses and icy silence. When she needed something, like her computer fixed, or booze, or drugs (not hard ones, obviously, but I did get her some weed for a birthday present once), or wanted a ride somewhere, she was sweet as could be. When I had an old car she wanted, she begged me for it, and was very nice to me for a while. Once I told her she couldn't have it, she hated me and basically wouldn't talk to me for six months. I am a photo buff, and have a very nice collection of DSLR's. She demanded (not asked for) one a year or so ago, which I declined. I did have an old D40/ 70-200 that I would have given her if she asked, but she demanded it. Again, icy silence. When I bought a new TV, she wanted my old one. I offered to give it to her if she organized my workshop (a six or eight hour job), she threw a fit and stormed out.

Before I moved out, when I was in middle school/ high school, she used to sneak up to my bedroom to watch TV. My mom wouldn't let her watch Southpark, and I had a TV in my room. We used to talk about things she couldn't ask my mom and dad. Does there need to be a condom involved if its just a blow job? I knew when she lost her virginity, and I drove her to planned parenthood the first time to get tested for an STD. I drove her home from parties and snuck her in the back door so my parents wouldn't know she drank. I thought I was a good big brother.  I was trying to be her friend, while still making sure she didn't do anything horrendously stupid.  I was letting her live, and make her own mistakes, while being there and providing something of a safety net. I know some of you would treat your younger siblings differently, but that's not what this is about. 

I always knocked before entering her room, and rarely did. She usually came upstairs to my room. It made me uncomfortable when I saw her in her underwear, and avoided it as much as humanly possible. I mean, we stopped wrestling on the trampoline when we were kids because it felt weird for me (this is when we were like 4 and 8). I always made sure to respect her, because she was my little sister and I loved her.

I lived two states away for a while, working a great job. At that point, I had rented a nice large house, and was living with my long term girlfriend (her and I broke up six to eight months later). Meredith begged my parents to buy her a train ticket to come visit me. She stayed for two weeks, and then asked if she could move in. At that point, I probably would have let her, but my parents didn't like the idea (something about having to switch schools and missing AP classes or some such nonsense), so I said no. Why would she try to move in with me if I had been molesting her?

A few other...red flags (?) that have come up. My dad discovered that Meredith has been ""borrowing"" his narcotic pain killers, about 3 days before she accused me of molesting her. Meredith tried to imply that it had been me taking the drugs, since I am on lots of painkillers for various ailments, and have been fighting some dependency issues. She's also been pushing for my parents to pay for her to get her own apartment for a little while. This would be more incentive for my parent's or something, I guess. My parents have money, and are relatively comfortable, but they certainly don't have the money to pay for her apartment/ life. She's also been begging my parents to let her adopt a puppy, and let it live in the house (all our dogs are outdoor only). She brought that up as ""protection"" against me. I think she wants something, and is willing to burn my family to the ground to get it.

I dont know if she was really ever molested, or if she's just lying because she wants something. If she was molested, I want to get her the help she needs, obviously. If this is just a ploy to get an apartment and a dog, I'm done with her. She would no longer be my sister.

My parents are fighting, openly (which they never do), my older sister has been fighting an eating disorder for 15 years and is slipping back into not eating.  My dad is drinking more than his rare beer or two every couple of days, turning it into a daily thing.  I'm not eating, or sleeping (so far I've lost 15 pounds in six days).  My family is falling apart.  Part of me just wants to sell everything I own, buy a thin and light laptop, and a plane ticket to anywhere and just run.  If I didn't have a girlfriend, I'd probably already have done it.  

I'm still collecting my thoughts, and trying to figure out what to do. Does anyone have any advice for me? Has anyone been in the same situation? I dont know how to defend myself. I dont know how to deal with Meredith. Please, askreddit, help me.

And please, if I've said something wrong, forgive me. I wrote this in one go, without editing, and haven't reread it. I just need to get my thoughts out. And yes, this is a throwaway. There are people on Reddit that know me personally, but dont know about this situation.

Need advice on how to find out what happened and where to go from here.",26,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/16kkgb/was_drinking_at_a_bar_came_to_at_sunrise_while/,"Here's a timeline of what I recall:

**Friday, 11pm(ish)** - Was drinking at a bar. I wasn't drunk, just having drinks with coworkers before Christmas. It was a trendy drink kind of place, and I saw a girl drinking from a ridiculous tin cup with some sort of strange garnish, so I teased her about her drink. She called me a jerk, so I ordered her one of what I was having. We talked for a minute or so, while our identical drinks were sitting on the bar, with both of us reaching through the crowd around the bar for them to take a drink. I mention this, because one theory I have is that someone was trying to slip her something and got my glass instead. Talking to her, inside the bar, is the absolute last thing I recall.

**Saturday, 2:08am** - Hospital records show I was brought to the ER by the EMS. I just received the ambulance bill, and it shows that they picked me up from the county jail. I called the jail and they have no record of booking me for anything. The jail is just a few blocks from the bar I was drinking in.

The hospital records list my chief complaint as Assault, but say I had no recollection of being assaulted. The DO's records say I was oriented, conversant and cooperative, but I denied being kicked in the face. The DO states ""this is just what the EMS was told"". The report also states I was clinically sober.

The MD's report says that I claimed to be drinking at a different bar than I remember being at (however, I am not from that town, and the bar I told the MD I was at is the only other bar I know of).

The Triage report contradicts some things from the other two reports, as it claims I thought the year was 1990 and thought I was in the town where I live rather than the town in which these events took place.

**Saturday, 3:06am** - Hospital records show I left against medical advice. 

**Saturday, Sunrise** - I find myself getting on a in-town bus at the downtown transit station (which is miles away from the hospital). I feel hazy and confused, and I can't recall my motivations for getting on the bus. I get off on a familiar street, walk into a store for a pack of cigarettes, and the clerk won't look me in the face and rushes me out. I sit down on the curb, and realize there's something in my arm, and pull my jacket and sweater away to find the heparin needle still inserted and taped to my inner arm. I am dressed exactly as I was at the beginning of the night, and my clothes aren't cut away. I don't have a hospital bracelet on my arm of ankle. My wallet, keys and phone are on me, but my phone is dead.

**Saturday, 8am(ish)** - After returning downtown by bus, I find my car parked at the bar where I left it. As my phone is dead, and I realize now that my face is a bloody swollen mess that frightened the convenience store clerk, I decide to drive two hours back to the town where I live.

**Saturday, 10am** - I call the coworkers I had been drinking with, to see what they remember. They say they saw me talking to that girl, and decided to leave for another bar, figuring I'd call them to meet up later. One coworker suggests I'd been slipped a mickey. After getting undressed I notice the EKG leads still attached to my body.

**Saturday, 3pm** - I check myself in to a local hospital, tell them my story, and get a CAT scan and drug screen. Neither tests shows anything, although the physician explains that they can only screen for standard street drugs like pot, cocaine, PCP, etc., and most date rape drugs are something only the police can test for. A police officer talks to me, and talks to an officer he knows from the town the incident happened in.

**Monday, Noonish** - After thinking it over, feeling sure I didn't just get so black out drunk I didn't recall doing it, I decide to make a report to the police. They say there isn't much they can do, although drink tampering has been happening in that town very often very recently. Without a suspect or any information, he couldn't start an investigation, but had me fill out a report online.

I also talked to the owner of the bar I last recall being at. He was very apologetic, but said he was there that night and nobody called an ambulance, the police, or saw anything out of the ordinary, but it was a very busy night.

**Monday, two weeks later** - I am back in town for a meeting at my office, and drop by the hospital to get my records (I had to be there in person).

Here are my concerns and lingering questions:

- There is nothing in the medical records or ambulance bill about an EKG test. Why were there leads on my body? Someone has suggested that because I was picked up in the Country Jail parking lot with very limited information given to the EMS, that I might have been tased by an officer who assumed I was drunk and disorderly, brought in for booking, but was found to be clinically sober, and they did the test on the Down Low to cover their asses. This seems possible but really unlikely, and I'm trying not to jump to conclusions because my memory of the night is nil, and I don't want to fill my head with suggestive stories just to fill in the blank.

- At the second hospital I checked myself into, they reduced the bill to next to nothing, probably with help from a victim's assistance fund. However, the bill I received from the hospital stay I don't recall is a huge burden, and I have no insurance. How could I apply for assistance with that hospital? Do I have enough information to apply for victim's assistance, without really being sure exactly how I ended up beat up and out of it with no recollection?

- What are some explanations for my lack of memory beyond being drugged? If I was assaulted, or even just tripped and hit my head, would I have a gap in my memory that clouds even leaving the bar?

- There are some, very vague memories of things I did, but I try not to think about them too much because it's like trying to remember a dream, and I'm not sure how much I'm just filling in. I remember the EMS and police officers standing over me, and talking about their comedy improv group. I remember walking quickly up and down the sidewalk at night, and at one point the sidewalk angling like a wall I had to walk sideways on. I remember walking by cars in a parking lot and setting off a car alarm. But all these things seem like a dream, and I don't know how much I'm just supplying in hindsight.

I am trying to piece together a puzzle in which the pieces all have mutable shapes. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

[Edited for readability]

*Update*

I visited the EMS station, and got their records of the night. The driver says I was indeed in police custody, handcuffed, in the parking lot of the jail. The police found me wandering the streets, smelled alcohol on my breath, and asked me what I was doing. I said I was, according to the official report, ""thinking about a girl"".

1362263595.0,18,self.Advice,19jmbp,A Little Bit Molested,23,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19jmbp/a_little_bit_molested/,"I guess this is somewhat of a weird thing to ask since I already feel as if I know the answer, but I'm sort of seeking validation that what was done to me as a kid was wrong, and wondering what a fitting response--maybe including legal action--would be. So here we go. Would you consider this molestation, or at least inappropriate?

When I was quite small, probably from the time I was about 3 or younger, until junior high, my mom would include me in a number of activities which even at a young age made me feel very uncomfortable and upset:

1) Every night until about 8th grade, she would have me undress in front of her to ""check you for ticks."" However, she would do this regardless of the weather/season or if I had been outside, and the inspection could sometimes last 5 or more minutes (not just a quick going over), and would most often involve examining my genitals, and running her hands over my body, including touching my genitals on the outside.

Occasionally also, she would feel/rub/pinch my nipples extensively, sometimes for several minute, and make comment about how nicely my ""boobies"" were growing in.

I have no way of knowing her true motives in doing this to me, or if she got any sexual gratification out of it, but at the time it upset me significantly, and it's always been my opinion that even if she didn't consciously intend any of this in a sexual way, it crossed the lines of decency and respecting personal space, especially as I got older.

2) Until I was about the same age (12 or 13) my whole family would sleep in one bed, and all naked. After a while this started to make me uncomfortable, and my older brother started sleeping in a separate bed when he was around 10, but my mom would specifically request that I slept with her (undressed) and would become resentful if I tried to sleep somewhere else.

Years later, even until I was around 16, she would still plead with me to please ""sleep with me for my birthday."" Which, regardless of intent, was some pretty poor phrasing on her part.

3) Around the time I started highschool and hit puberty, my mom began to make increasingly sexual comments about my body (and about my friends, as well, all of whom were also 14 or 15 years old.)

She forbade me from wearing a bra all throughout highschool, and I would often catch her staring at my chest when I talked to her, or as I was walking. She would tell me often that she could see my ""little titties jiggling.""

She gave sexualized ""compliments"" to my best friend, such as remarking how ""buxom"" she was (this upset my friend severely to the point where she's still wary to come to my mom's house, and mentioning these encounters will anger and digust her almost to tears), and would make remarks, too, about just random children on the street, such as saying they were ""developing nicely.""

4) More recently (up until now, even, as I live with my mom and commute to college) I've still had encounters with her that make me uncomfortable:

a) Several months ago, I walked into our unlocked and unlit bathroom, thinking it was empty, but found my mom masturbating and mostly unclothed. When I tried to leave she asked me to stay because she wanted to talk to me.

b) When my current boyfriend first started coming to our house, she would ask him if his ""virtue"" was ""still intact,"" and ask me, sometimes in front of him, if he'd ever had sex with any of his previous girlfriends/boyfriends.

Naturally, I guess, this has all stuck with me years after it happened, especially since to some extent the insanity continues. However, I work on and off at low paying jobs and don't have a lot of savings, so I can't move out, especially since I'm 19, still in college, and not particularly qualified for anything.

It stresses me out pretty severely to live here still, in light of everything that's happened. I've gotten a lock on my door which gives me some peace of mind, and I'm slowly swapping out all the lockless doorknobs in our house. All the same, it's nowhere fucking near the situation I'd like to be in right now, and any ideas are appreciated. I don't know a lot about the laws surrounding things like this where I live (NYS) and I haven't even given a lot of thought to if any laws were broken or if I'd like to pursue legal action where possible, but there you have it, so

comments? advice? thanks.


**Edit:** Forgot to mention that my school is a 2-year community college with no on -campus housing, which is why I commute, so there's no possibility of being able to live there.

**Edit again:** I also wanted to mention that yes my mom does have the tendency to consistently sexualize children. She is highly religious (Catholic), and teaches a 4th grade Sunday school class, as well as sometimes speaking at a local youth group (and works part time as a substitute teacher). In both these instances, her talks often center on ""chastity""/abstinence and quickly descend into scrutinizing the bodies and sexual practices of small kids and underage teenagers, but, sanctioned by the religious officials at her church because it's in their Sunday school curriculum, and by the other highly religious adults around her, this doesn't raise a red flag because it's a common way of thinking in their particular circle.

Other people have been cautioning me not to bring future offspring around my mom. This is definitely excellent advice for someone with children, but since I have none, I'm more concerned (and I'm beginning to doubt this is possible) about keeping  her from the children she teaches and tutors. (She has recently started referring to the 2 year old sister of one of her students as her ""little friend,"" giving her gifts and hugs, which I'm loath to interpret as entirely innocent). Since most of the children she interacts with are the kids of her religiously like-minded adult friends, I would have no idea how to address something like this with them, since much of the behavior I see as inappropriate, they're willing to dismiss because they've known her for so long, or are also used to casually sexualizing children in lesser ways.",,False,,t5_2qjdm,1362329623.0,,,True,t3_19jmbp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19jmbp/a_little_bit_molested/,

A bit of background information. TD Canada Trust, a Canadian Bank has begun to notify Iranian-Canadian clients in May that it would no longer provide them banking services, in some cases referring to Ottawa’s economic santions against the Tehran regime [source for skeptics]( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/07/12/canadian-iranian-td-accounts_n_1668181.html). My father, an affluent business-man in Ontario, has just been notified of that his business account will be closed. My father left Iran in the early 80s, studied in Canada, raised a family in Canada, he has a Canadian passport. Yes we (my father, my mother, and myself) send money back to Iran, my grandmother (on my mothers side) depends on a pension from the government which is 800 CND a month. My father is the oldest of 10 children he is also the most well-off, there is no question that he would help his family. We are not politically involved in Iran (not even our extended family). I am in first year law at University of Toronto, I wish I could give my father some advice but I can’t I don’t know enough but here are my ideas and I would like someone or some people to help me out.

-TD is proud of their social responsibility; whether its for gay rights, or environmental responsibility, why then when it comes to Iranian- Canadians do they exclude us. My father has been a client of TD since 1981 and of Canada Trust since 1987. He has had multiple mortgages (all of which have been paid for) he owns a medium size business and has a substantial amount of capital invested in TD. Additionally, I am relatively aware of the Iranian-Canadian community in Ontario, and its quite affluent, so hypothetically speaking if all of these people were clients of TD why would they just shut them out. 

-This must be against Human Rights act, on a case by case basis I am not speaking on behalf of other Iranians but my father does not send money to any terrorist organization. So why are we being punished. This is not fair to exclude an entire community. 
My father didn’t ask me to do this, actually he doesn’t care, he has accounts in multiple banks and is if anything annoyed by the whole thing. But I won’t stand for this, this is wrong and unjust. If someone has any suggestion of what I can do I would be really grateful.

Thank you.

1348522545.0,19,self.Advice,10ewf9,"Never fail at conversations, job interviews, or life again!",25,6,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10ewf9/never_fail_at_conversations_job_interviews_or/,"Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you didn't know what to say, how to say it, or how to keep a conversation going? Maybe you we're on a date or a job interview and you're not sure what to do or where to go with your conversation. Well there is no need to worry anymore because following these simple steps will improve any conversation you have with anyone!


Some basic rules:

Rule #1 : People love to talk about themselves. They love to talk about how great they are, the great things they have done, the great places they have been, etc. Always appeal to peoples ego's!

Rule #2 : Establish a common ground!  When you have something in common with another person it will always make the conversations so much easier. The reason is, it's a topic you both can discuss and not feel nervous discussing. 

Rule #3 : When they share a story with you , share a story about a similar situation you were in as well. This helps with RULE #2.

Rule #4 : Do 75% listening and 25% of the talking! The reason for this is it shows you are listening to that person and respect their time. Also, it allows you to gain valuable information about that person to 


So now that we have some basics rules down let's get started!


Step 1:  Open Ended Questions

So you may be asking yourself. ""How do I start a conversation with people?"" or ""What do I need to say to get this person to like me?""

First let's start with my friends:

Who, What, Where, When, Why, How!

Starting any conversation or question with these will result in what's called an "" OPEN ENDED QUESTION"". Notice that if you start with one of these type of questions it requires a person to give a detailed response. A simple yes or no won't suffice. 



Step 2: Close Ended Questions

The only time you use these is to get a definitive answer from someone (YES or NO).  Typically they start off a sentence with:

Do, Can, Will, May I, Have, Is, Shall ,Does! 


Once again these are used to get yes or no responses or to clarify what the other person is saying.

Step 3:  Rapport Building

This is not “RAPTOR BUILDING” it is “Rapport Building”. This means you find out something interesting about the person and you share a similar or common story. This will allow you to have a common ground with this person and relax both parties which will allow you to enjoy your time together. 

Dani Johnson has a tremendous method to rapport building. It's called  F.O.R.M.  If you remember this you will never fail to start a conversation or have anything to talk about.  So what does F.O.R.M. Mean?  

Ask questions to the person about the following areas of their lives:

Family / Friends 
Occupation / Organizations
Recreation (what they like to do for fun, hobbies, etc)
Message  ( share a story or common experience with them )


Step 4: Tell me more!

This step is one of the most helpful tools I can offer to you.   When someone says something important and you want more information about it simply say the following:  

“ TELL ME MORE ABOUT THAT” or  “ WHEN YOU SAY ( INSERT WHAT THEY SAID), WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?


By doing this it keeps the person talking and you are in the drivers seat. 


So now that we have the basics covered let's look at some examples!




Example #1 On a date: 

Scenario: Scumbag Steve set's you up on a blind date. You arrive to find out that he set you up with the hottest person in the world, the person of your dreams and now you are stricken with fear! You start to tremble and sweat. Your voice begins to lock up, crack , and panic set's in! What do you do? You remember your 6 friends, W,W,W,W,W,H! 

Example:

You:

So, (Dates Name), it's a pleasure to meet you, Steve has told me a lot about you! HOW, is you're day going so far?

Date:

It's going great!

You: 

Really? Tell me more about that!

Date:

Well, I went shopping today which was a blast. Then I went home and started to get ready to meet you! I was kinda nervous because Steve isn't always the nicest guy when it comes to setting me up on dates and I have had bad experiences before. 


You:

I was nervous about meeting you too so don't worry. I have had bad experiences as well. You never know who you are going to meet these days. 

Date:

Yeah, really I know what you mean. Too many crazy people out there. 

You:

So you said you went shopping and has a blast, tell me more about that?

Date:

(person rambles on – then the stories over  and for some reason you missed the last 5 minutes of the conversation because you sneezed and were nervous about having a stage 4 cliff hanger)

WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?   (Hint: REMEMBER F.O.R.M)


You: Wow sounds like you had  a lot of fun. So tell me, what do you like to do in your spare time? 


/ END EXAMPLE







Job Interview:

Remember on a job interview the goal is to get them to like you. If they like you it doesn’t matter what your skill set is. Don't believe me? Think about it, how come the guy from marketing gets the job with less skills than you, less education, etc? It's because he is “LIKED” by the person who hired him. His friend is the hiring manager, etc. The bottom line is people want to hire people who they like. Not necessarily who has the best set of skills. They want to hire someone they like because they know they can trust them or feel they can do the job without having to be told a million times because you are friends. So bottom line, when you are in a job interview you need to do a core set of things:


Basic Rules:

#1. Establish Common ground with the interviewer. When you walk into their office look around for a moment. Look for the following items, pictures of family or vacation spots, items on the desk that represent a sports team, school, or something they have won with the company. Look for unique items, painting, etc.

The reason why is you are going to use that item right away to break the ICE and get the interviewer to like you. How is that possible? It goes back to RULE #1 at the very top ! Get people to talk about themselves and they will like you. 

So find that item in the interview room and get the person to talk about it.  Once they start talking about it it's time to sneak in a few of the FORM questions.  

#2. When they start asking you about why you would qualify for the position it's time to flip the script on them and ask them the questions. Here's why!

Example:  

Interviewer:  “Tell me why you would be a good fit for this company?”

You: “That's a great question! I would be a good fit because (list a few thing about your backround). Let me ask you (Interviewer name), what would you say the biggest problem you are facing now with (position)?

Interviewer: ( Lists off problems)

You: (Repeat back what you heard) Tell me more about that? 


/end 

What you just did was ask the person to tell you what the biggest problem is they are facing and now your responses will be centered around solving the biggest problem they have! If they see you can solve the problems because your responses are directed toward their issues you will get the job over a qualified person.




I hope this helps you all and hope to bring a ton of information to you in the near future!

Now, before we call Jerry Springer, I should add he is not her son by blood, only marriage.  She helped me raise him since he was 2 years old.

I suppose I always had suspicions of them doing something while I was working, but I never really thought it was possible for her.  But over the holidays, she (we'll call her F50) bought panda lingerie (I don't like panda print, I like zebra print, my son likes panda print) while my son was out of town to spend Christmas with his biological mother.  That's when I first suspected something.  Upon asking her why she bought that when she knew it wasn't the kind I like, she responded with, ""When does M23 get home?""  I told her he would be back by New Years to spend New Years with us and she dropped the subject.

I recieved a text from my son shortly before New Years to say he was going to stay with his mother for New Years.  A little disappointed, but still fine with it, I told him okay, that we could celebrate New Years when he got back.  He said that was fine and asked how F50 was doing.  I said she was missing him and we were looking forward to having him back again.

On January 3rd, he came into the house and asked where his cat was.  I told him, ""Welcome home, your cat is gone into hiding, I'll get him for you.""  Thinking he was just missing his cat.  When I brought his cat to him, he put the cat into the carrier.  I asked him why he was doing that and he responded with, ""Because I can.""  I said, ""No, really M23, why are you putting the cat in the carrier?""  He said, ""Nothing against you, but I'm leaving.""

Needless to say, I was a little shocked but he was 23 so it was fine if he wanted to move.  I said, ""Well, alright.  You don't have a job, so where are you staying?""  He said, ""I found a place and F50 said she'll pay for it.""  

I turned to my wife at the time and asked her what the hell was going on.  She said she was leaving me for M23, that he could treat her better.  Neither of them work, I was the only source of income.  

I'm not an abusive man, quite the opposite, I was both of theirs doormat for years.  I have no friends because my wife didn't trust me enough to allow me to socialize.  She made sure to get rid of all my friends over the course of our marriage.  Both of my parents have passed on and I have no siblings.  The ""worst"" I have ever done to them was lecture my son about getting a job or going to school to further his education, and request that my wife at least have food on the table when I get home from work and then rant and rave when I would return home only to find both her and my son have been on the computer all day and the sink was filled with dishes, no housework done, and no food made, hell, even a pack of ramen would have kept me happy, but I didn't even get that.

Another shock to me was all these years of my son growing up, I thought he was gay.  Not because he never brought home any girls, but because he had a boyfriend for 5 years.  Now, I didn't like his boyfriend and everyone knew it, but not because he was a man, it was because I would see my son buying that guy everything he wanted and my son never even got a thank-you in return.  Plus that guy would leave my son anytime my son didn't have any money and I would be there to pick up the pieces, only to have this guy magically appear in my son's life again when he got some money.  So my son doing this to me was very painful.  A deep soul kind of pain.

It has been 6 months (almost 7) since this happened and a few weeks ago, my son got back in contact with me after disowning me.  He's my son, I love him, I don't like him for what he did, but I still love him.  So I welcomed him back in my life with opened arms.  It opened a few wounds that had healed since the incident, but I was willing to work through it.  While talking with my son, I found out that he was still with my ex-wife (I applied for a divorce shortly after they left), and that they were living with some of her family after losing the apartment.  I told my son he was welcome back into my home but she was never to step foot on my property again.  At first, he seemed okay with the idea (trouble in paradise, I suppose), but out of nowhere, he then blocked my number, blocked my email, blocked me from everything I had to get in contact with him.  Once again, my heart was broken.

A few days ago, I ran into an old mutual friend of ours, well, she was more my ex-wife's friend, but I didn't have a problem with her and I enjoyed her company.  I asked her how she was doing and she gave me this look like I had a turd on my lip before leaving, saying I would never get in her pants, that my ex-wife warned her about me.

In September, I'll be 50.  I'll be celebrating the big 5-0 alone.  All I wanted to do was get drunk with my son and spend that day with him.  I miss him with every fibre of my being.

Reddit, how can I move on from this?  How can I get back in my child's life again?  We used to be so close, at least, I thought we were.  If I can't be in his life again, I want to at least be able to heal.  I don't enjoy the club scene, I'm too old for that.  I tried going out and getting exercise and meeting people, but after 20 years of my life revolving around 2 people, I'm so socially awkward, it's painful to watch.  Does anyone have any ideas in what I can do to at least find a purpose to live again? 

Edit: (Forgot a tl;dr)  My wife of 20 years left me for my son (her step-son) without any warning.  Son got back in contact with me but then blocked me from contacting him.

I'm not sure that I like her in that way, but before that I have other concerns. Is it wrong? We were both briefly in high school together; last year she was a freshmen when I was a senior.

I honestly want nothing more than for her condition to improve and for her to be happy, but I don't want us to be negatively judged by our friends and family.     

Her condition is getting worse which leaves her confined to the hospital or her house. It's so bad she is getting home-schooled now. She has very little friends and terrible self-esteem, so she doesn't talk to many people aside from me no matter how hard I try to help her make new friends.          
       
What should I say to her? When she told me that she loved me, I kinda shook it off and acted like she was just kidding but she reasserted herself and she said she was being serious. I then very awkwardly changed the subject and she sounded disappointed. I feel like the right thing to do is to reciprocate the feeling... but I'm too afraid of the age gap.

The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they’ve faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.

Don’t worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.

Do one thing every day that scares you.

Sing.

Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts. Don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.

Floss.

Don’t waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind. The race is long and, in the end, it’s only with yourself.

Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.

Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.

Stretch.

Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don’t.

Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You’ll miss them when they’re gone.

Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll have children, maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll divorce at 40, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else’s.

Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don’t be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own.

Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.

Read the directions, even if you don’t follow them.

Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.

Get to know your parents. You never know when they’ll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They’re your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.

Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.

Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.

Travel.

Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you’ll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.

Respect your elders.

Don’t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you’ll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.

Don’t mess too much with your hair or by the time you’re 40 it will look 85.

Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it’s worth.
But trust me on the sunscreen.""

You need to have your shit stolen before you remember to lock the doors.

You need to see homeless bums drinking themselves into the ground before you realize that could be you and their flaws exist in you (us all) as well, to lesser degrees.

You need to see the invincible fail and the innocent die.

You need to see the way different kinds of people react to different approaches. This is a broad statement, but it needs to be. You will always be changing the way you handle situations.

You need to be old enough to look back and remember being so young and sure-hearted, now able to realize you were running blindly in the wrong direction.

You need to be punished unreasonably to know how it feels to be on the other end.

You need to learn to love a few times, and lose what you loved to find a new normal and find who you are when you're stripped of the people you identify yourself with.

You need to be old enough to realize how different you are today, but how incomplete and young you still are.

You need to have to work to survive before you know what it takes to make it. When a lunch costs you two hours of work and dinner costs two more, you realize how lucky you are to have everything you have.

You need to have a boss so you realize what it's like to work under someone's authority by choice.

When he bought, the family that was living in the Section 8 house next door (low-income housing) was ok, not great, but not the worst. And by ok, I mean they sold drugs, had rats in the house and treated their kids like dirt. We lived with it and made peace with them, and eventually came to be more than passing glares to one another. They moved out in August. The house sat vacant for a couple months while the slumlord did repairs, but a new black family with 4 teenage boys and a number of other children moved in a few weeks ago and it's a goddamn hellish nightmare. They drink to blackout on the back porch a few nights a week, making an insane amount of noise and breaking shit all the time. We've worked really hard to have a nice garden out front and their kids trample all over it while they play football in the street, not giving a shit if they hit cars or stop traffic. The differing race piece creates a sticky situation because this is D.C., and race tension is high in this neighborhood where the population is turning more white every day. Our other neighbors love us, and commiserate with us, but they don't hear the loud gansta rap at every waking hour, or the kids screaming and crying, or the constant swearing and smoking going on behind closed doors.

So... we (a small group of friends) are in a bit of an awkward situation. We're all in college, and we live in the dorms. Myself and my best friend are roommates (and we're girls), and my boyfriend and her boyfriend are roommates (boys). 

Lately, my boyfriend has started bringing up a weird situation about his roommate (my roommates boyfriend). When the roommate thinks that my boyfriend has fallen asleep, he'll start masturbating. This is troubling because the boys share a room (it's a small little dorm room), and, sometimes, being a light sleeper, my boyfriend will wake up and be greeted by the sight and sound of his roommate jacking off (to porn, obviously). 

Multiple times now, he's said something about it; both immediately - right when he catches him - and the day after, when everyone's pants are on and computers are on more innocent sites; yet the problem persists. His roommate just makes up an excuse (oh, that wasn't porn, that was a gif on Tumblr)(What? That noise? Oh... I was just itching my leg.)(Darn pop-ups!), refuses to talk about it, and avoids the topic.

So, in desperation, he brought the issue to my roommate - asking her to say something to her boyfriend to make him stop. She, however, isn't really sure how to approach the topic and is even becoming slightly wierded out by her boyfriend over it. 

So... we're not really sure what to do. The best option - having my boyfriend just talk to him about it - hasn't worked, and neither of them are sure how to proceed from henceforth.

Nobody is saying that masturbation is bad, or that we want him to stop wanking off; it's his dick - more power to him - and we're all pretty open about sex. Nobodies judging anybody for wanking off - just about their choice of time to do so. My boyfriend just wants him to stop doing it while he thinks that he is asleep. What else can be done?

I need advice.  ,18,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13tyjb/ex_is_sociopath_becoming_consistently/,"We had a horrible legal breakup - small children involved.  In a nutshell, I agreed to a SPO out of court, but he surprise filed for full sole custody after refusing the settlement the night before our scheduled hearing.  He has a family of sociopaths - I believe all learned behaviors from his parents.   I came out primary custodian, with standard possession order after a very messy hearing 8 months later, where he and his siblings without remorse presented straight up fiction about me.   I didn't do anything of the sort.  Judge saw through it though.

Has lawyers at his disposal in family.  I do not.  Oldest is autistic and needs consistency always or gets very stressed.   He purposely emotionally manipulates the children,and exploits their feelings to make transitions from one house to the other extremely difficult.  I am always upbeat and optimistic to them when they come back ""we'll see him in a few days!"" and the like.  

He is progressively become obsessive and controlling with phone calls/texts - maybe 2 -6 a day?   needing to talk to the children.  neither talk - it's just to make him feel better and assert control over the kids.  ends with the autistic child freaking out because he has no sense of time.  I always accommodate his schedule changes where I can - which is almost always.   

Everyone tells me to move farther away, but I fear this will actually make his progressively obsessive actions far worse.

Everyone tells me to document everything, but how?  he refuses to email, i'm sure on the advice of his litigator family members.  

Among the gems in his family are a convicted child molester, frequent adulterers, a sibling who committed suicide after realizing they had lost their mind after 6 months (also happened to one of their parents).  I'm not going to sit here and complain about how he emotionally abused me for the better part of a decade into a shell of a human being - that part is over.  Took me forever to leave because of what I knew i would be facing afterwards.   I left when it was vital for protection of the kids.  My only concern is the safety and well being of the kids - i don't want them to follow the path of his family.  

My fears - 
He is going to lose his mind like a few of his family members, which he seems lately to be on a path heading that way.

Child molestation - i am not accusing him of this - it's not fair to do so, but it's always in the back of my mind.  His sociopathic emotional manipulation of my kids is starting to scare me to that affect.  They cannot be protected based on something that is a possibility - what can I do?

Any move of self preservation I make will only make it worse.  

Family law seems to be protective of his rights more than the safety of the kids.   He's a skilled sociopath - so he is good at making himself appear to be an awesome person - he's also narcissistic  - if you look up anti social personality disorder it's like they wrote that diagnoses about him - he's patient zero.   Just to give you a better idea of what i am dealing with here.   His family represents him in court and will continue to do so, I do not have this luxury.   I feel that I cannot move on with my life because he's just waiting for a hole to form to so he can rip everything apart.  

I'm about to send him an email hoping to temporarily defuse the situation about his incessant calling/texting - effects on the kids.  He'll call, text, then he'll call again, then he starts calling my family members.   I do not ignore his calls, but I do not carry my phone around.  Lately I've had to screen the calls - as they are getting progressively more frequent and obsessive.

Help - what do I do?   

**tl;dr : ex is a sociopath, progressively become an obsessive ex; emotionally manipulating the children; seems to be protected by family law, what am I supposed to do?**

Parents pay for food and are currently paying for repairs for their home. But, they just kind of latch on to us wherever we go and more or less stay for free. I hate that too. Wife is unemployed at the moment and is looking for a job, though opportunities around here are very scarce. I pay all the bills, brother pays the rent. Brother has enough money to cover the rent and have some leftover, but it's SSI so it's once a month. I dont make enough to have my own place, even if wife had a job it would be too close for comfort.

My brother is terrible with money, and I always have to fix things. He's pawned our game consoles for 40 bucks or so just so he can go out for lunch because he was too lazy to cook or just didn't want to eat the food we had at home, and I end up having to make the payments on it/pick it up. He's written checks for shit when he knew his account was empty because ""Nothing will happen, they won't cash the check until after I get paid I'm sure of it."" He's done that one so many times he almost went to jail over it-I was the one who had to pay some bill or fee or something so that wouldn't happen. He's very defensive whenever I try to say no/why cant you deal with your own shit.

The last straw for me has been this whole week. My old car is dead, and has been for a few months. I need a new one. I've been using my dad's car which is a broken pizza shit. I haven't been able to save up much of anything for a down payment since I have to fix all my brother's shit. With this week's check I would have had enough for a down payment on a car. Trusted dealership, great car/deal. Was looking forward to it all week. The night before, bro comes in my room and tells me I have to pay 270 bucks or so. For what? Oh, he took out loans months ago and never told me/never paid them and has no money so if I don't pay they'll come take our shit as collateral. And on top of that, the phone bill is twice as much as it should be. I asked him to call and find out why/how, see if we can work something out. He comes back and tells me I can pay half on x date and half on y date. I ask why its so high, did he even try to find out or make it easier for me. He just shuts my door and walks away. Bastard didnt even try. And then he's bragging about having 100+ bucks left and plans on buying cards with it. What about the money I just paid, are you going to give me that to at least partially pay me back so I can get that car? ""You dont even need that money, you dont need a car. Just keep using dads car."" But he was bitching about me getting a new car for months. And yesterday/today he took everyone besides the wife and I to dinner/movie. He could have easily paid for half of those loans.

What can I say or do to get him to understand that this shit is not okay?

Please help, so we can help him and our family situation.",14,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dfjkc/we_just_cant_seem_to_figure_out_how_my_brother_is/,"I have an 11 year old brother and we (my family) just can't figure out what's up with him. I intentionally didn't use the word 'wrong', for I don't believe he's malfunctioning, he probably just has his own way of living.

He has always had anger issues, especially when he was younger. When he was a toddler, he would lie on the ground screaming for hours and we wouldn't know what to do with him. Now as he's grown older he's kind of lost this habit, he replaced it with not exposing his emotions at all. We never know what he's up to. We never know how he feels. He tells us stories, which we don't understand, but he never understands why we don't get what he means, this frustrates him. Then he gets angry. We try to understand but he talks such about such random out of the blue subjects. We don't understand what he's saying and why.

He's also incredibly selfish. But we get the idea that he just doesn't realize there are other people in the world than himself. He will never do something for you, even if you've done something in return already. He will not throw your piece of paper in the trash even though his is right next to it and he's on his way to the trashcan for his waste. When we ask him to set the table, he will only set down one plate, one knife, one fork, one cup, just for him.

Also, every time we ask a simple question, like: how was your day? He'll respond with something like: why do you want to know? This makes it seem very suspicious, as if he's been up to something.
Thirdly, even though he is already 11 years old (almost 12) he still doesn't do anything unless you tell him to do so. If you don't tell him what to do exactly, he won't brush his teeth, change into regular clothes, shower, go outside, play with friends, comb his hair. He would just sit in a chair and do nothing. When you tell him to do something, mostly, he doesn't respond and doesn't listen. My parents get tired of him not listening and not taking any initiatives. They get mad at him. Then he completely shuts down and will be angry with you for a long time.

He is very smart, but is so easily distracted that he doesn't have the best scores in tests. All the points he loses, he loses because he doesn't finish the questions, because he was daydreaming, or at least that is what we think.

You can send him upstairs to get ready for bed, in half an hour you can go up there and you will find him playing with his toys, not having done any of the tasks he was given. He is so easily distracted. You can tell him that if he doesn't hurry up, he can't watch tv for 2 days, but he won't care. He doesn't realize. The next day he'll only get mad at you because he can't watch tv. It also seems like he doesn't learn. If he is used to putting his bike in the left half of the garage when he gets home, you can tell him every day, every hour, to put it on the right side. It causes no more effort or whatsoever, but he just won't do it. These are the little things that my super practical and perfectionist dad gets extremely angry about. He and my brother keep having the same fights over and over but my brother doesn't learn. This is frustrating for us all.

He's gone through several tests, but the outcomes didn't say much. We as a family are worried about his future. He is also very easily influenced and believes pretty much everything one tells him. I'm worried he might end up with the wrong people, in the wrong places.

Do any of you know what to do?

tl;dr: Little brother thinks in here and now only, doesn't know about consequences, doesn't think ahead, has no initiative, and we as a family are worried about his future.

I am European student currently studying in the UK. Today during 2pm I was cycling to the University in specially marked cyclist outer lane and an elderly lady flashed the lights and turned left at the last moment. Remember it's UK so we drive on the left side. She crossed my lane and I hit her car at the full speed. Thankfully, I had a helmet and a backpack on, so it took most of the damage, but mid flight I kind of turned and also fell on my right arm, resulting in a wrist injury. I was kind of shocked at the moment. The other cyclist helped me and gave me his number, so I can add him as witness. The elderly lady left the car and asked whether I was alright. I being shocked started saying that I have an exam (which was actually happening in 10 minutes time) and she told me that she can give me some cash for a bus ride or a taxi. I told her that I want a police involved, so she went to her car and drove away. Unfortunately, I was not thinking clear so I did not get her plate number. I reported it to the two police officers and briefly explained the looks of the lady, her car that I barely remember and gave the witnesses details. Tomorrow I am going to the police station, in order to submit the report in person. I have no idea what are my right and what can I do to help them catch her. Is it a valid reason to sue her or report somewhere? What can I do if they will not find her? I have plenty of questions that I can't figure out answers to.

I seriously don't know what to do. I'm a female senior in high school.

First off, he's a type two bipolar alcoholic with a severe God-complex. He's on meds but it seems like they aren't working. He's been drinking more and more lately and by four in the afternoon he'll always be a few beers into it, and keep going throughout the night. This is better than the 3+ mugs of whiskey that it used to be, but still. 

I feel like I'm not a person when he talks to me. It's always demeaning. I don't feel like an equal or even a child. I feel like a dog. 

Currently, I have a boyfriend. We're very serious with each other and it is an adult relationship. He goes to college semi-nearby and we see each other maybe once a week, but talk every day. 

The turning point from normal behavior to this was when we had a ""heart to heart"" a few months ago. He asked me if I was sleeping with my boyfriend and I said I was (which was and is true). Since then, everything got weird.

It feels like my father goes out of his way to try to make it so I can't see him. He'll come up with any excuse to cancel what I was going to be doing with my boyfriend. 

Yesterday we got in an argument and I left with my boyfriend. My father sent me a text saying, ""Come back, we can watch movies like we used to. I miss you."" Which just sounds creepy to me.

I also think he's reading my texts. He'll reference things that I never have said to anyone but who I was texting. I know he doesn't have a keylogger installed because I checked every running program on the computer. I just hate having to regulate my conversations.

He makes inappropriate comments and jokes towards my sex life. It makes me feel ill. He does a lot of very intense massage therapy stuff, and I was getting one from him because I hurt my neck. Every time that I didn't do something right he'd gently smack my face and say NO. It was very.. BDSM-y and put me into subspace. He'll often reference BDSM things (which he NEVER had before) and it's something my boyfriend and I do together. It was a disgusting feeling being put into subspace by my own father. 

I don't know what to do anymore. This is my father. I don't feel safe. I don't want him to escalate to physical anything, even if I doubt he would. There is only so much I can describe through text, but I honestly do no feel I'm reading too  much into the situation.

1346477189.0,13,self.Advice,z6anb,"Need advice on little brother's behavior in regards to pornography, seriously please help. ",17,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/z6anb/need_advice_on_little_brothers_behavior_in/,"So I'm kind of at a loss of knowing what to do at this point. I apologize that this is such a long post but I could really use some advice, I can't even list all the instances of my brother's porn escapades (trust me it's a lot).

 My step brother who just turned 13 yesterday has been causing some problems but the one I'm most concerned about is his is what I can only describe as an obsession with porn. Now I know a lot of you are thinking for his age what kid doesn't try to see that, hell I did when I was in my teens, but what is worrying me is the sheer amount of times he attempts it, his methods of obtaining it, and what exactly he's looking up.

 First of all, when he looks things up on the internet he can make your browsing history look tame in comparison, it's not just a couple of sites he looks at and gets excited over, it takes several pages worth of just links in his browsing history to find what all he looked at in a single day. So it started over a year ago when some friends told him how to look it up on the internet and he started using the family computer to look it up and was caught immediately, he was punished given a very long lecture but that didn't deter him even for a day so my dad and stepmom were forced to put locks on the computer but even that didn't stop him from trying to find something frequently.

 On his 12th birthday his mom had the ""brilliant"" idea of getting him his very own laptop with the intent of putting parental controls on it. It did not take long to discover that she didn't really know how to set up parental controls properly. Then when he started school and I was away for a while he would be home alone while my parents were at work and in a period of no more than 3 weeks he managed to rack up over 700 dollars worth of pay per view porn. No I am not exaggerating.  More issues with the laptop, which was taken away from him on multiple occasions, occurred leading up to this summer when I returned home.

 On the particular day he was ungrounded and got the laptop back, after having the umpteenth lecture about what he can and can't do, I checked his browsing history and sure enough he did it as soon as he got back. As to why he still hasn't had it taken away permanently I have no clue. 

Well I had a long heart to heart talk with him about how I'm concerned with his behavior and what should be done to make better choices in his life. Parents do not take away laptop, instead attempt to reestablish parental controls, and fails he fucking does it again the very next day, this was back in late June.

 But here's where the fun begins, he's not just trying to find pictures of people having sex or nude girls anymore he has moved on to some hardcore stuff, worst of the bunch being things involving rape. This was not something he simply stumbled upon, there were many, and I mean many searches for things involving rape. His parents were forced to have a different kind of talk with a 12 year old about rape and finally his laptop was removed.

 However, then began just outright stealing devices from our rooms like an iphone, ipod touch, a nook, anything that had an internet access to find more porn. Also there was the occasional slip up of not logging off the computer thus giving him free range if we happen to leave the room for 5 fucking minutes. Last two times was my dad's mistake of not logging off in the past two weeks on multiple occasions. And making reappearance in his latest escapades was more rape content, as well as attempting to find child pornography, with that I don't think he realized the dangers of doing that but he was warned about it none the less. 

But since then he has been grounded, everything that gets a signal has been put on lock down and he only manages to look for shit when my dad and stepmom forget something which he takes full advantage of, but for the past two weeks he hasn't been able to do anything, until today…

Today marks the biggest WTF moment yet, for his birthday yesterday his Mom, again, gets him his very own phone, it can't connect to the internet. However today he proceeds to text everyone he knows nonstop but the worst thing was he texted his female cousin who is already 13 and asked her to take some nude photos of herself and send them to him.  His aunt is now too scared to let her kids be anywhere near him. 

So there you have it, I can't even list all the times he has been caught breaking these rules, all the talks he's been given whether sensitive or harsh, all the punishments be it loss of property or physical labor or simply being grounded, and all the restrictions put in place on anything that can be plugged in have had no effect whatsoever.

 If you have any suggestions please please please let me know. He's at the point where he doesn't even show remorse or guilt about what he has done anymore, instead he gives off an attitude of annoyance that he got caught and doesn't care how we feel about it, he hasn't shown any reason to believe we simply have his best interests in mind but rather that we're a hindrance to his will.  His behavior scares the shit out of me and I'm seriously worried I'm going to have a sex offender for a brother in the future.

  If I seem like I'm exaggerating it's simply because the number of times he has ignored the rules and done whatever he has felt like is abnormally high, the lengths he goes to get what he wants, and some particular things he is attempting to obtain goes far beyond the realm of adolescent curiosity and interest and into the realm of outright obsession over sex.

1372084575.0,13,self.Advice,1gyxt3,My boyfriend is still in love with his ex ... in a platonic way ... but still.,18,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gyxt3/my_boyfriend_is_still_in_love_with_his_ex_in_a/,"For obvious reasons, this is a throwaway, and I have to be kind of vague about the details. So, my boyfriend and I have been together less than a year, we live together, and we know that we will get married and have a family. I know that sounds fast, but we were friends for a while first.



So, lately I have been becoming more and more aware that we really share little more than a bed and some meals. Don't get me wrong, we love being together, we have great sex, and he is honestly the greatest boyfriend. He is super supportive, patient, understanding, loving, etc. I hate that I even have a concern because he's so amazing. He is far too good for me. Herein lies the concern. He's way smarter than I am, far more successful, and just better at life in general. We don't have anything to talk about! I don't understand what he does, and even though I have an interest, it's easier for him to just talk to people he can relate to. His ex-girlfriend is also his business partner, and they get along really well. She is wonderful, I really like her, and she also has a boyfriend who is lovely.



I did something that I promised myself I wouldn't do in this relationship, but I failed. I snooped. I read some messages between the two of them and it made me feel awful. They're very close. Like, secret language close. They even have a nickname for me which neither of them use around me. Which, in and of itself, I don't mind, in fact I think it's great that they've managed to maintain their relationship post-breakup. What sucks is that he and I are nowhere near that level. And never will be. We're just not like that. They talk all the time, spend all day at work together, and just absolutely love each other. Recently he spent a fun night getting quite high and drunk, and in a text conversation with her told her that she was the love of his life. Now, this was said in a very platonic way. I'm not worried that they're going to have an affair, or that he's bemoaning the fact that they're not together. I just hate that he will never feel toward me the way he feels about her. We'll never be that close.



I'm worried that I'm just filling in the puzzle of his life. I fit the wife-shaped hole. He knows he loves me and thinks I'll be a good mother, so he doesn't have to think any further than that.



But, I want more. I want us to be everything to each other. Not excluding other people, of course. But, I really want that best friend closeness. I keep trying to nurture that, but our conversations don't go anywhere. I'm not interesting or witty enough to keep up. And I don't know what to do.



I know that if I just let go, we will get married and have a family and everything will be wonderful. But, I can't help feeling inadequate. I don't know what to do.



TL;DR My boyfriend told his ex that she is the love of his life. I feel like a placeholder.



EDIT:

UPDATE:


Sorry for the delay, everyone! So, two nights ago my boyfriend and I had a wonderful evening together, talking and eating, and I was really hesitant to spoil it with what I needed to talk about. But, eventually I brought it up, and he heard my concerns with a very open, patient and understanding ear. He assured me that my assumptions about his words being expansive and poorly chosen due to his inebriation and drug-induced euphoria were correct. But he did acknowledge that it was a very inappropriate thing to say. We agreed that it wasn't very thoughtful of them to use a nickname for me together that they did not also use with me. And he told me that he switches back and forth between using it and not using it (I understand that it would be very easy to slip into it when everyone around him is using it). He was very understanding of what prompted my snooping, and was ready to forgive me. We talked about how I had never done that before with him, and I assured him that it made me feel really shitty so I would not do it again. I told him that I knew it wasn't the best way to deal with my feelings, and the next time I'm feeling anything similar I will instead talk to him about it right away. We are both interested in actively nurturing our friendship and closeness. He told me that he tries to not tell me too much about his work because he thinks it is boring for me. I told him that the opposite was true, and we agreed that he would tell me more things, and I would ask him more questions about them. 


I feel very good about everything. I think we each only have one not great feeling about everything. Mine is that I feel super shitty about the fact that I snooped, and that will forever be in his memory bank colouring my character. His is that he can't talk to his friend about our discussion because he doesn't want to paint her a bad picture of me. Of course he wants to talk to her so they can discuss how to improve their interactions to be a bit healthier, but he doesn't want her to have to know that I invaded her privacy. But, we agreed that everything will be ok, and we'll just both keep working at it.

They are tolerable to an extent. They would come over constantly to ask how we got our yard so beautiful or landscaping advice. They kind of suck at taking care of plants. They thought a tree was dead but it was just a late bloomer. We stole the tree they dug up and it is blooming beautifully. 

But this is not about how they lack a green thumb. It's about how cruddy they are to animals.

They first had a puppy outside for a week or so on a really short leash in late March (It was still snowing). Week later, I noticed it was gone. I asked and they said it was ""too much work"" and ""grew too big"" so they took it back to the humane society.  *facepalm*

A little later, the wife came over and asked where was the closest emergency room for animals because one of their cats swallowed some pills that they left on the floor. The cat survived fortunately but they placed her outside.  I know she was an indoor cat before and I asked the husband about the cat being outside and he said ""We know"". This cat, she's a beautiful Persian with a flat-face. Every night for a week, she would come over to my house and meow at the door. 

 Every single time we would take her back.  And every single time the wife would make up an excuse saying it was an accident she is outside or she thought coyotes got to her.  Even though this cat would sit on their lawn and they was a water dish for her on the porch. I was really worried about her safety because of construction, people driving fast down our road, and coyotes that last night I lured her into my yard and gave her a separate room in my house away from my other cats. She had no collar on her.

I'm going to take her to the vet later to see if she's okay and going to give her a bath.  Her legs are covered in mats, poo, and mud, and looks absolutely miserable.  As much as I want to keep her, I am borderline crazy cat lady and have not enough space for another cat. I have some friends that are interested in taking her in.

I feel really conflicted. What I did was theft but I feel like I saved her life. She's an utterly beautiful and cute cat that sticks her tongue out. Really soft and luxurious where there are no mats and poo on her. My neighbors don't know what a beautiful cat they had that they would just carelessly throw out to the street.


TL;DR: I ""catnapped"" my neighbor's flat-faced Persian, feel like I did something bad even though this cat was dirty and covered in mats, and I am finding her a home.


Any advice would be appreciated. Did I do the right thing? What should I say to the neighbors if they even bothered to care to look for their cat?

I only knew him for half a year. That's it, a measly half-year. He moved to my high-school last semester (August) and that's the extent of my knowledge of him. 
We become really attached, though. We were really good friends. We'd talk pretty much every day. I had 2 classes with him and spoke to him at lunch, so we knew a good amount about each other.
I learned that at midnight on Friday, he took his life. He shot himself and was pronounced dead at the hospital.
There were no signs of bullying, nor was he depressed. He had a girlfriend, good grades, and things were looking pretty good for him. Nobody, not even the family, knows why he did it. There's a rumor going around that he might have had a mitochondrial disease which would have impaired him and he couldn't take it, which might be the truth considering the family might be taking lawsuits. (This is also what I've heard, not confirmed.)

I do miss him. He was a funny guy, and we had the same sense of humor, etc. I know I haven't known him for too long, but it feels as if I had. I guess this is the first person I've ever really had close to me that has died, and it sucks. I'm not planning on going to the funeral, but I am working with a few of his (and my other) close friends to make a tribute video which will be played at the funeral.

Now to the question: those of you who have lost somebody dear to them.. how in the world did you deal with this? I haven't cried at all since I'm not a very emotional person, but I'm filled with regret and stress. School has a dark haze around it now that he's gone, and I don't want to go.

1355632821.0,12,self.Advice,14xfh1,Worth a shot.,13,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14xfh1/worth_a_shot/,"I'm sure my story will go unnoticed but seeing how i haven't a single person to talk to, I figured I might as well share it here.

To start things off, when I was around 2 my young parents (19 and 21 at the time) separated and so my mother and new-born brother of mine moved in with my mother's parents. When I turned 3 I started going to preschool and my teacher noticed that I was behind the other students with my speaking skills. As time went on my speaking became better but I noticed I still had trouble communicating with other people. I pretty much ignored that for quite a while.

When I started first grade I loved it... until I was abruptly pulled out of my class to join a combined class of first and second graders. The teacher only taught second grade lessons which was way above my level and I ended up failing the first grade because of it. My mother was so upset with my school that she ended up transferring me to another one. My mother tried her best to get me into the second grade but wasn't able to seeing how far behind I was. So there I stayed for the next 5 years. During that time though, my mother purchased her own small home and my younger brother and I moved with her. She got back together with my father and he moved in as well. My brother and I, not actually knowing our father, hated him the instant we saw him.

As time went on at home, he began to abuse my brother, mother and I. He did heinous things to my brother that I cannot speak of and so very much wish to forget. About a year or so after having moved in with us, my mother became pregnant with my youngest brother. A couple years after he was born, he became a spitting image of my father and my father's prized possession. My father would tell him to hit us or pull our hair and he'd do it, my youngest brother being of course only 3 years old at the time he obviously didn't know better. My father would ask my youngest brother to do strange, disgusting things for him. My second brother and I were too afraid to say anything to anyone about anything. It was so horrible to watch. After struggling for 5 years in elementary school, I finally finished it and was excited to go to middle school with the very few friends I had. During summer break that year, my mother told my brothers and I that we were moving to Tampa because my father's job had relocated him there. Needless to say, leaving the city I was born in and my friends behind left me heartbroken.

After about 3 months of living in Tampa, my mother had finally had enough of his verbal and physical abuse towards her. My brothers and I could not have been more happier to leave that awful city and the monster we called ""dad"". I was also happy to leave the school I was attending there which was a combined high school and middle school. I was picked on and bullied relentlessly. So my mother, brothers and I moved BACK in with my grandparents and I was enrolled in the middle school that my few friends and I were planning on going. The rest of my first year of the sixth grade was very rough for me. My troubles with my social skills had gotten worse after just hitting puberty. It was hard to focus on my work, it was hard to talk to anyone about anything, it was hard trying to relate to people and it was difficult for me to maintain eye-contact when having to talk to someone. So I ended up failing the sixth grade, failing the seventh grade and finally failing the eighth grade. After all of that I was pulled out of middle school by my mother and sent to a technical school once I turned 17. Same thing happened. My troubles kept me from doing what I had to do and so my grandparent's money was wasted. A year later I decided to try community college and of course, it happens again. I drop out of my prep courses.

I tell my mom and grandparents that I think I need to see a specialist. So we did and after a while was prescribed medicine. Unbeknownst to me, the specialist told only my mother that I had a type of autism. Asperger's. She chose to keep that a secret from me. To this day I do not know why she did that and probably never will know. I found out from hearing it from my aunt who had thought I was told about it. I stopped taking the medicine once it started to give me electric head shocks and stopped seeing the specialist. So here I am now 4 years later and still in the same position I've been in my entire life. I'm now 22, still living with my grandparents, no car, no driver's license, no job, no friends, no girlfriend (haven't even kissed a girl) and most of all, no confidence. All I do is sit in my dark bedroom all day. I'm so severely depressed and thinking things that I shouldn't be thinking. A month ago I decided to make a facebook page to try to get back in touch with the world and old friends. But hardly anyone remembers me and my friend requests to the people I used to know just get declined. I don't know what to do with my life from here on. I honestly think I won't be able to handle another year of this.

I still have trouble with people and it's gotten so much worse. Grocery shopping has even become a chore for me because of the amount of people there are around me. I just wish the social anxiety would end already.

I'm sure you're thinking that all of my problems can be fixed on a moment's notice but it just isn't that easy for me right now. My mother just had her third open heart surgery done about few weeks ago and my grandparents are struggling to keep everything afloat financially. Things are as bad for me as they've always been.

I'm sure this post will be forgotten and probably not even read completely but I just wanted to get my story out there and if I'm very lucky a bit of advice.

Thanks.

He's a middle aged man, schizophrenic, and does not take his meds. All of the other neighbors have told us he's nothing to worry about and all he does is walk around outside and yell at night but that he's not violent.

He walks around outside for hours at night screaming nonsensical things in a rage and kicking down trash cans and frequently gets close enough to my house to set off my motion sensor lights outside.

Last week as I was pulling out of the driveway he chased my car.

Tonight has I was pulling into the driveway I saw him standing right next to my house, peering into my bedroom window.

I've called the police several times. They never do anything about it. My husband works at the nearby hospital and has a good rapport with several of the police officers who bring people in in and they told him that they get calls about this man almost every night.

I'm getting to my breaking point with this.

My husband works third shift so I'm alone at night and my sense of peace and safety has been completely destroyed by this man.

We just signed a year-long lease for this house, so what do I do to solve this? 

EDIT: Thank you so much for your advice, everyone! I sincerely appreciate it. I'm going to go down to the police department first thing Monday morning and speak to an officer about this and possible file a report against. I might actually look into getting a restraining order against him. I'm also going to start trying to video or at least audio record some of his ""episodes"" so I have proof. And thank you for assuring me to keep calling the police. I felt like it was futile after awhile since they weren't doing anything, but I will keep making sure they have it on record regardless.

i was a stay at home dad from the age at which my son was born until he was around 9 months old.
i went on E.I so my ex could goto work to get her hours for maternity leave, so she could get sponsored through E.I to pay for her school.
but it was literally the best 9 months of my life. i spent every single minute of every single day with my son, literally only spending probably 20 hours away from my son in the first 9 months of his life. i'm a good dad, i literally save every extra penny i make, and all my pocket change goes directly into savings for him.  Me and my ex split up a little over a year ago now and since than she's made it hell for me to see my son. She had a guy she barely knew move in with them and almost immediately told my son to call him daddy. Legally there's nothing i can do about this, I'm aware of that, but it does kill me to hear my son call him dad when i pick him up, to the point where i want to go through him, but to do that would only make things worse for me in the eyes of the court.
anyway, we tried mediation but every agreement we came to she would agree to in the room, than afterwards call me and tell me she doesn't want to do that anymore.
all i'm asking for is 50/50 custody of my son. but today my lawyer told me that statisticly the chances of that happening are around %2, based solely on the fact that she has been the primary care giver since we split up. but the only reason she has been the primary care giver is because she made it that way. she'd stop me from seeing him at every turn, ignore my calls when i'd try to get him. whenever we faught over anything she'd hold him over me and tell me i wasn't going to see him. and it seems like all the record keeping and everything i've done when it came to this doesn't mean a bag of shit anymore. i was told repeatedly that "" the courts don't favor the mothers anymore like they used to"" but i'm being told by my lawyer that they do, and there's not much i can do about it.
i'm broken in half thinking about only getting him 2 days a week. he's my son, MY son. i want to be a father to him more than anything in the world. i don't drink, or do drugs, he's always the first thing i take into consideration when it comes to anything. i spend literally every penny i make on him, doing anything i can to make him smile. i haven't even dated anyone since me and my ex split up because i'm scared to introduce him to anyone or get him confused.  and i don't want any of my time to be taken away from him. 
right now i feel absolutely devastated. it might be a good point to add that my lawyer is through legal aid because i work a minimum wage job. also i'm in canada to the laws may be a little different than they are in the states.
i'm just asking for advice, anything that can help me see my son more. i really want to post a picture of him, but i'm afraid my ex will see it and hold this against me.
she takes off randomly, for a week at a time, turns off her phone and wont answer me, i don't know if he's safe or not.  i need my son in my life. more than part time.
i literally have my son being used against me like a terrorist.

In a nutshell, I am a 33 year old mom of a really awesome 5-yo girl, and wife to a severely mentally disabled 40-year old. He collects disability, but I have been trying to get him on medicare so he can see someone, but it's not working too well. So while I scramble to try to find work (I'm a graphic/web designer who - for some reason I have no idea - has not been able to find work the past 9 months) and make the bills and make sure our kid is taken care of, he is sleeping due to his meds, or trying to function at bare minimum while he is awake. I have been with him since I was 17, so I have been with him a while.

His condition is not getting any better, and I am constantly stressed because I can't feed my family or get my car up to date registration or do normal stuff like oh, say, go to dinner with my friends (what friends?). I feel disorganized, and there is so much to do, but I get lost in details like keeping the dishes clean or getting groceries, or applying to 20 jobs a day, and then taking my kid to a birthday party with a questionable amount of gas in my tank because I don't want her to be left out because I'm failing.

I wish my husband would be there for me when things get rough, but usually either he goes to sleep while I cry all day otherwise he gets mad at me.

I have tried other things, like face painting on weekends or whatever I can do to make ends meet, but at this point in my life, EVERYTHING I am doing is a giant FAIL. Like beyond anything I ever remember experiencing.

I feel like I am just so close to giving up - but I have no idea what giving up entails. I feel like I have already given up, and I just have not realized it yet. 

A friend once told me (while referring to my husband) that you can try really hard chopping a tree down with fingernail clippers. You can try and try, but it will take you a long time, if eve, to chop the tree down. When what you really need to be using is an axe. I feel like I'm trying really hard with a pair of fingernail clippers. But I wouldn't even know what an axe looks like if I saw one.

I guess I don't know what I'm asking for. Ideally, I would love it if someone who knows about design jobs would have a look at my portfolio to tell me why I am not generating any leads, and what I can do to get more work. I dunno, either that or tell me that everything will be ok, and I don't need to worry anymore.

My best friend is very clueless. He was raised in a very *sheltered* environment, and he's going to get himself hurt one day. I am 14 years old, and he is 13. Please don't judge me because of my age.

1. He is afraid of going to the mall or any store by himself or with someone else our age, because he thinks that an employee will think that he lost his mom and will call the cops or something.

2. We had no school one day because of teacher conferences, so he took me to visit a city about two hours away with him. As soon as we got there, he was afraid to go anywhere because I made a joke about how people might think that we were skipping school. He didn't want someone to call the cops on us.

3. He believes EVERYTHING he reads online, in newspapers, tabloids, or in other ""news"" sources. He also believes everything his mom tells him. He recently showed me a magazine called ""Infowars"" that was all about how our government was extremely corrupt, how the bill of rights doesn't apply within 200 miles of the boarder, how President Obama is plotting to take over, etc. I thought he was messing with me. It turns out that he actually believes it, because his mom and her boyfriend believe it so it must be true.

4. He had no clue what sex is until I unknowingly explained it to him. He was visibly shaken for hours after that.

5. He believes (or should I say ""his mom believes"") that vaccinations don't actually do anything. His theory is that schools require mandatory vaccinations to get people ready to mindlessly do everything the government says and transition America into a police state. He doesn't really like my father, who is a doctor.

6. He started growing a mustache and panicked because he ""was starting puberty early and needed to see a doctor immediately"". I also told him that his voice was also getting deeper (big mistake).

7. One of his other friends (who I dislike) got into some trouble. His friend told him ""They suspended me for asking if I could borrow a pencil!"" My friend started freaking out about how he was now an enemy of the school, and how he was going to sue them. He was stating stuff like that until I said ""With what money?"". He was angry at me for a moment, but then calmed down enough to state how he was resigning from his position in the NJHS, and how that will show the school. I told him about how no one would give a damn. I then explained about what really happened to his friend. (His friend didn't bring any supplies to class. The teacher was very annoyed with him, but got over it and started class. He was very loudly asking if he could borrow supplies from other students. The teacher told him to stop multiple times, but he kept on disrupting class. He smirked at her the entire time, too. She got mad and sent him to ISS for the rest of the day. Two hours, tops.)

8. He thinks that the government is evil. He told me how they staged the 9/11 attacks, most recent wars, most recent developments in medical technology, the recent explosion in west Texas, the recent bombing in Boston, and a lot of other stuff.



I care about him a lot. He's going to get himself hurt one day. He infuriates me to no end sometimes, but I keep on holding on to our friendship. He shouldn't life his life as a very ignorant, fearful person. **What can I do to help him???**

How do i fix this?,13,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1d33zm/i_blamed_my_wife_for_something_i_later_discovered/,"Last evening my wife told me that a medical bill of ours had gone into collections.  I take care of all the bills in the house except for the medical bills and I was quite angry that she let this happen.  She didn't seem very concerned about it, and this only made me more upset.  We argued, got the kids into bed and argued some more.   As usual things that have no relevance were brought into the conversation and she told me that she doesn't like the way that I speak to her (""like a parent punishing a 5 year old"") and that she needed a while to ""cool down"".  She went in the other room and I respected her space.   

I was really hoping that she would eventually come and talk to me but when I went to check on her she was about to fall asleep.  This got me upset as I was waiting for her to let me know that we could talk again.  I told her that I would not be able to sleep in this situation and I was surprised she was able to.

Well, we went to bed (together) angry.  After we got the kids off to school we called the Dr who sent the bill to collections (we have an excellent relationship with him and have referred other friends to him).  The receptionist told us that each member of our family (children also) has their own account so when my wife was checking for out standing balances she was only checking on her account.  The receptionist told us that other offices ""household"" family accounts and that their method was not efficient and leads to errors.

Upon discovering this my wife was upset that I was not more apologetic towards her.  I tried to explain that we sill had an argument that grew into something that was larger than this event but she feels that I need to somehow make up for this.

We had intended to have breakfast together and I was going to go into the office late.  She told me that I ""might as well leave"" if I was going to act this way so I did (wrong decision).  She has told me that she is disappointed in me and that I need to fix this.

So, what do I do?  I am not great with my emotions and my first instinct is to buy flowers and write a note to her as this is my usual response.  For what it is worth we don't argue much and have a great family and life.   I am not very good with this sort of thing and I know what I have hurt her.

If it matters at all my wife stays at home and I am the only source of income. 

tldr: blamed my wife for a bill that went to collections only to find out that the doctor messed up and not her.

I have too many problems, some major and some not so important but it's all kind of a big clusterfuck at the moment. First of all, my friends treat me like crap. They're not very good friends and most of our 'conversations' either include ridiculing me or making fun of me because I am asian. I've managed to put up with it and dismiss it as friendly banter but it always gets to me how stupid and childish what they're doing is. Also they don't really do things I would do for them. For example defending a friend for making what the others deem a 'stupid decision' or offering actual advice to a friend on relationships instead of making crude sexual jokes surrounding him and who he likes. Also I share no real interests with them, sometimes I just see them as people I walk around school with everyday, and when I try to have a serious conversation on the things I like such as a video game with an excellent story they just laugh at me.

Another big one is how my GCSE subjects aren't going very well. I'm lazy. And I'm happy to admit it as I'm becoming desperate. I have no aspirations and the only thing I can see myself doing in the future is pursuing a career in engineering. But at the moment I'm lagging behind in all my subjects and I keep telling myself to put my head down and get on with my work but that isn't enough motivation. I keep telling myself ""I'll do it next time"" and most of the time I delay it till the night before the deadline. The only way I can describe it is that I'm waiting for that line block in Tetris to come tumbling down the screen.

Another is how I can't stop thinking about this one girl. She's in the year below me and we met on a trip to Italy in March last year. And we just clicked. She was pretty, funny, intelligent, and we shared a lot of common interests. And the reason why I haven't spoken to her since then is because I figured it would be too distracting to chase after a girl during the time I need to study. But it's kind of heartbreaking as I walk past her hangout everyday and it reminds me of how I blew my chance. I would do anything to get the chance to bump into her in the corridor and start a conversation with her on Pokemon.

Another problem which is quite annoying, but not as important as the others is the fact that some of my hair is turning white, and it's quite embarrassing for the lower years to shout ""lol your going grey"" every time I'm queuing at the canteen and I have no idea what's causing it. I've thought maybe it was my diet but for all I know there's nothing wrong with what I eat as I eat mostly rice and other Asian foods. I could believe it was a result of stress as every time I'm trying to relax, or play some video games with my 'friends, my older brother comes in and annoys the fuck out of me and I can never accomplish anything with him around. 

And to add salt to the wound, I recently found out in a conversation with my mother that one of the main reasons I was born was because my mother didn't want my brother to grow up being the youngest child in the family, so I was born to be his friend. This plan backfired big time and It made me feel a bit worthless at first.

Anyways, if you have any advice I'll gladly take it, heck I would love to talk to someone who was or is in a similar situation to me. Either way it was good to type this up and express it to someone.

1375147680.0,11,self.Advice,1jbgwf,"My cousin has been lying to our entire family about becoming a medical doctor. To add to that, she's somehow making a ton of money and parties like crazy. I'm worried. Should I say something?",14,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jbgwf/my_cousin_has_been_lying_to_our_entire_family/,"I originally posted this in /r/AskReddit, then realized it should be here. So here's a repost:

My cousin and I are the same age (mid-20s), and grew up together. Both our parents were very strict about school (think Tiger Mom). We were both on the path to medical school, but in my third year of college I decided it wasn't for me. She, on the other hand, continued on.

Four years later, she graduates and is now apparently a resident in a very competitive specialization.

But, I am very familiar with the medical school application process, have a few close friends who just graduated this year as well, and have always had my doubts about her ever being in medical school. Stories just didn't add up. And just a few days ago, I found concrete evidence that she really isn't a doctor.

Not only has she been lying, but 2 years ago she moved into a condo paying nearly $2000/mth in rent, and a few months ago bought a nearly $70,000 brand new luxury car. I also discovered a 'secret' facebook account of hers with pictures of her partying (which is in stark contrast to her family-only facebook profile with squeaky-clean photos). She spends money like crazy - everything she owns is brand name, and has no problem jet setting to the Bahamas and staying in a 5-star resort every year.

She ""convocated"" this year, and she and her parents spent a ton of money at a very expensive restaurant to celebrate with our extended family. Nearly 80 people in attendance. I wasn't able to attend since I was out of the country at the time, but all I see are tons of photos from the dinner. Several weeks later, not a single picture has emerged of her at convocation, with the cap and gown, diploma, nothing.

Sometimes I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she really was in medical school and she's just been trolling me by being so secretive.

Well, now she is a 'resident'. Has been for nearly a month. And here comes the concrete evidence: searching for doctors on the college of physicians website, I search for my friend who just graduated from another college - her name is there. My other friend who graduated from the same class as my cousin - her name is there. As for my cousin's name? ""No matches found"".

And it's not just the lying, but the types of lies. She's not just graduating from medical school, but she wrote the board exam early because she is at the top of her class? She didn't just do well on the MCAT, but she scored in the 98th percentile? She didn't just get into any residency, but one of the most competitive with only two spots available? (And recently, according to my friend who is actually a resident, there is only one resident of that specialty in the entire city, and he's an Asian guy). Is she a compulsive liar?

Even if she was a doctor, how can someone at our age possibly afford to pay for her condo, a brand new car, go on shopping sprees, luxury vacations, and party like a rockstar?

I want to tell her that I know. I can't imagine what kind of stress she's under for keeping up with such a huge lie. I'm also worried about what she is *actually* doing.

Reddit, should I say something? Or nothing?

What do I hope to accomplish by confronting her? I feel like this started with a small lie. And it's only snowballed. But sometimes keeping up with a lie is easier than telling the truth. Especially after 4 years. I'm trying to put myself in her shoes. If I was living this lie, I would want relief. I want to talk to her and let her know that I understand how insane our family can be, that it can be hard to keep up with their expectations, and that she can be open and honest with me. We grew up together, almost like sisters, but she's always been very closed off and secretive about things she simply doesn't want to talk about. I want to be able to talk about what she's going through, and find help if I can. Also, what's her end game? I could easily have told my family about the website and let them find out for themselves if I wanted a big, dramatic 'HA! I knew it!"" reveal. I want to handle this as delicately as possible. I'm just wondering if this really is a matter I should concern myself with, or let the lie live for as long as it lasts?

**TL;DR: Cousin has been lying about becoming a doctor. Also is making outrageous money somehow. Worried about her lifestyle and not sure how to (or if I should) confront her.**


EDIT: I just discovered this old reddit post. Oh God. Maybe I'll just play along?!!

I learned how to make money, pay bills, and live on my own since. I've been living in Kansas by myself for about three years. 
Recently, my grandmother, who I was taking care of on the side, died. A friend of mine who lives near my parents told her that I was planning on committing suicide when I reach my 40's, due to how I see life as a hostile monster that needs conquering rather than an enjoyable voyage many other individuals seem to convey it as. 

She immediately insisted to move in with me, so she could ""help"" me, so that I would realize that life isnt as shitty as I say it is (Even though it is, at least for an outcast like myself.) After a few months, I decided to allow it. 

Ever since she's moved in, she's been making me go out on a  daily basis, something that I find extremely irritating, as I have a deep hatred towards the human race. I do not show this or tell this to anybody, as I don't believe that my personal views on humanity are to be spread. I may be negative, but I do not wish to ruin the happiness of others, despite how others have treated me in the past. 

Now, despite my mother's past abuse and superstitious life style, I still dont want her to be uncomfortable or unhappy. This causes issues considering she's been trying non-stop to convert me into her superstitious, dogmatic fictions, aswell as she keeps trying to turn me into some super-optimistic, delusional coward who doesn't see the world for what it is. 

This, and she makes me feel like a basement dwelling loser that lives with his mother at the age that I am. 

A few nights ago, she insisted that our cats, who we recently transferred from my grandmother's home, should stay in my room, considering they were more familiar with me than they were with her. I hated the idea, as I knew they would urinate on my bed sheets. She insisted. 

Lo and behold, they pissed on my sheets. I immediately, furiously put the cats outside, to which she complained. I told her, that they had pissed on my bed, and that they were to stay in the living room, where the litter box was. She screamed and hollered about how I am abusive towards the cats, even though all I did was grab them and put them outside. She's always stretched the situation to make everything I do seem like I'm an evil prick. 
I went inside my room, and relaxed for a bit. When I came out, both her, and the cats, are missing. 

She's yet to return, and is continously making my life harder than it was before. 

So now, not only do I feel like a freak that everybody will forever despise, and will die alone, but now I feel like a perma-virgin freak who lives with a (attempting) manipulative mother. 

What would be the most appropriate action to take? Should I move out again? Should I ask her to go back to her hometown? Should I speed up the process of my inevitable suicide?

I have a friend (we shall call Bob) that just returned home after being one of the contestants of a reality show. It's one of the shows where the people have a skill that is tested (TUF, Top Chef...) in addition to the usual in house drama.

I read the biography that they are going to post regarding Bob. Between the bio and what he has told me about his experience, It is clear to me that they are going to cast him as the bitch/jack-hole.
The thing is, Bob is a nice guy with a pretty delicate ego. He came home from filming thinking that the producers loved him and will show an 'honest' portrayal of him.

He is going to see himself on the show and worry that it is going to harm his business. But even worse, he is going to believe that everyone actually sees him as that guy on the show and I know it is going to break his heart.

I think I have made it clear to him that there is the real Bob that his friends and family know and love. Then there is going to be the Bob on the show that is the jack-hole that the viewers are going to hate and laugh at. Has he accepted that this might happen? I don't know.

So why am I posting? I'm just looking for ideas for ways to mitigate the impending ego smashing doom that is bearing down on a friend of mine.

I'm 22F, been married for a couple months. Husband is the only partner I've ever had. I've known him for about 8 years, we've been together almost 3. On average, we have sex once a week. 
My husband was very sexually active in highschool and early college. When we were dating, we'd see each other about twice a week, more often then not having sex just as often. Me, having never had sex before him, was super excited about it. I wanted it all the time, anywhere I thought we could get away with it. (I've always been a sexually driven kid.) He had more self-control, wanting to cuddle more than actual sex.
Now, to be fair to him, his last two relationships before me were almost purely based on sex. He was engaged to one but she left. The other one left him at the worst possible time in his life, after losing his apartment, job, and cutting ties with his family. He's worried that if we have sex too much, our entire relationship will be based on that, and eventually crumble into ruin soon after.

When we first moved out together, about 6 months into dating, we had sex pretty regularly. (The whole, ""new place! have sex in ALL THE ROOMS"") There was a short while when we were both working retail, so our schedules didn't match up all that well. Once we both had stable jobs, it picked back up again, and has slowly decreased from about 3 times a week to once. 

He currently works full-time at a warehouse. I do understand that it's a physically taxing job and he's usually pretty tired when he comes home at the end of the day.

I've been...wanting more in our sexual life from pretty much day one. I've tried to talk to him, but he always gets super depressed about it. I'll say something like, ""I just want sex more often"" and he'll shrink down, avoid eye-contact and reply with, ""I know, and I'm a horrible husband, I can't provide for you, I can't make you happy,"" etc. I hate seeing him so self-loathsome, so I make him feel better with ""I understand you're tired, I need to calm my sex-drive, you always make me happy,"" and so on until we can function like normal human beings again. 
I'm not saying he doesn't make me happy in other aspects of life. I love my husband very much, he's my best friend. He works very hard every day to keep a roof over my head, food on the table, and our cars running. I appreciate him so much, and I try to show him by keeping the house clean, cooking dinner when I can, and pleasuring him when he doesn't expect it.
I would often give him blow jobs and hand jobs while he plays games, when we're watching movies, or when we shower together. Almost every night I ""help him"" go to sleep by assisting his masturbation in some way.
Whenever I (in passing) mention me wanting HIM to start sex instead of me, he'll say something like ""well, you keep me well-taken care of!"" I know he means it as a compliment, like ""you're such a good wife, I don't need to start sex!"" but I can't help but be a little offended by it. What about ""taking care of"" me? It seems to me that almost every time we have full-on sex, I have to instigate it. But I want him to start it, now. I want him to pursue me. I keep telling myself that I'll stop giving him handjobs and helping him at night just so he'll want it after a while. But how do I tell him ""No, I don't want to help you tonight before bed"" ALL OF A SUDDEN, when that's been the norm for almost 2 years? 

We're very open with everything else in our lives. We watch porn together and help each other masturbate. But I feel like this is something I can't tell him without making him feel horrible about himself. I feel like I want sex every day and that would make me happy. I know that's physically impossible for most people and it's probably a small form of withdrawal, so I think every two or three days would be perfect. I would LOVE every-other day.
I do understand that there are couples who haven't had sex in months, maybe even years, and that once a week really isn't something to complain about. I try to keep my view in check and count my blessings, but is it bad to have a high-sex drive?

TL;DR: So I guess my question is, how do I tell my Husband, who has been scarred by sexually driven relationships and becomes extremely sad when he feels like he can't provide, that I want him to instigate sex more often? Is my sex-drive absurdly out of control and should I seek medical attention to remedy that? Is 3-4 times a week too much to ask for? Should I stop ""helping"" my husband in an attempt to make him seek me out?

My grandma passed away a couple of months ago. She made up her will already, and all of her grandchildren got money. She saved the money in an envelope, which I kept in our money safe at home. The only people who are able to get into this safe are me, my brother, sister and mom and dad. I saved money myself as well, and I had saved about 1.400 euros (My grandma gave me 790).



But then, a couple of days ago, I wanted to get my passport, which was in the safe as well, a long with my money in my own personal safe. I opened up my safe, and noticed that my envelope was open. And it was not as thick as it used to be. I opened up my envelope and found out there was little money left. One of my family members must have stolen it, clearly. He/She has stolen 870 euros.



I called my mom, and told her, she got my dad from upstairs, and my sister came downstars as well. My brother wasn't home that day. Both of my parents were angry and my sister as schocked. She counted the money with me, and was angry at my brother. We're pretty much al convinced he stole the money, since he've stolen a lot of money from my parents as well. The problem was, ofcourse, that he wasn't home that day. He came home at night, and we went out for dinner with our uncle from America ( we live in Holland) which is a pretty big deal, ofcourse. So we didn't really talk about it with him, and the next day we were leaving for a vacation with the whole family, including my granddad, uncles aunts cousins, etc. So I still didn't really talk about this with my brother.



But ofcourse, I have no proof or right to say my brother stole the money, although I can't imagine my sister stealing it. My brother allways has a LOT of money, and can for some reason afford shit he shouldn't be able to afford with his job. I have no idea what to do, how to act or what to say when bringing this up, and I am in complete disbelief, ofcourse. We brought my money to the bank now, and only my mom and dad are able to get into the money safe right now. But still, I have no idea what to do. I hoped you guys might know what I'm supposed to do.



btw; this is a throw-away account, since my brother is a Redditor. And I hope that if he reads this, and indeed did stole the money, that he could be honest with me and tell me it right now. Because if I find out he actually stole the money and didn;t tell me, I'm not sure if I will be able to forgive him.



Tl;dr: only my parent, brother and sister are able to get into the money safe, yet somebody stole 870 euros from me. It has to be either my brother or sister, though I have to admit that I think it's my brother. I haven't spoke with him about it and have no idea what to do.



Do you guys know what I am supposed to do?
I really hope you can help me, thanks alot anyway!



&gt;And I'm sorry if I don't speak proper English right now, but I'm really tired and not that good at English anyway.

I really need advice from you! My girlfriend of just over a year got pregnant unexpectadly. We decided that we would stay together and see what happens in the future as far as marriage is concerned, but at least try to raise our son together for now. She is divorced with two 12 year old kids. She only gets $500 a month from her ex. Her and the ex currently swap the kids every other week, so she (and I) have them 2 weeks a month. 

She has moved into my home because she plans to stop working once the baby is born. We both agree this is a good idea, because her low salary would only go to day care anyway. My issue is that her ex husband and I live on opposite ends of the city. For reasons of school, she wants to keep the kids in my home fulltime with them only going to their dad's on the weekends. But she doesn't think she should ask the dad for more money. In NV (where I live) the norm for his salary with 2 kids is $1,000 to the main custodial parent.

I am barely getting by on my own financially. Now, I will be expected to take care of her and my son financially, (her cell phone bill, car payment, food, etc..)(his diapers, food, toys, clothes..etc) and now she's expecting that I should just take on the kids too!!!

I feel that its unfair for me to take on her kids as well. But I can't help wondering if that makes me selfish or if I should be able to legitimatley put my foot down here and require the kids to live with their dad fulltime. How am I going to be able to afford 2 extra teenagers? Its a touchy subject because I don't want her to feel that she and the kids are unwelcome. I have nothing against the kids either,...I just didn't sign up for an instant family either. She told me she couldn't get pregnant, and she had her 2 kids via invitro. So this is a surprise to us both. 

Reddit, what shoud I do??????????

UPDATE: UPDATE: Thank you all for your honest advice. I really really do appreciate it, and though some of you stated that turning to internet strangers may not be the greatest idea, I happen to think unbiased advice is the best way to go. The kids father has decided he will have the kids during the weeks. We will have them on the weekends. My girlfriend doesn't particularly like it, but outside of her and I, it makes sense for the kids and school, family etc..We had a budget talk and I recommended that she get a part time job to cover the extra outflow of money. We will see what happens. I know it SOUNDS like she trapped me into this situation, but I really don't think that is the case. I know she would rather not be pregnant right now, and after a fight almost walked out, but I asked her to stay. As of now, I am feeling much better about the sitaution than yesterday, and I owe alot of that to you all. Thank you.

I have been barely getting by the past year and a half. I have childcare assistance so my son can go to daycare while I am in school full time through the year, and we live on my financial aid and child support (that barely pays the electric bill). I have another year and a half left until I have my degree. I was told by my case worker that if I didn't take classes over the summer I would lose the child care assistance, but since my financial aid had run out I couldn't do that. I told her I was going to work over the summer. She gave me an extra 2 weeks extension to find a job, and in that 2 weeks I put out approximately 200 applications both in person and online. Everywhere from office jobs to fast food, NOT ONE SINGLE CALL BACK. I have work experience, I am in college, I am not completely offensive to look at, I have no idea why not one person would hire me. 

Anyway, the deadline to have a job is tomorrow and I have nothing. I called my case worker and explained that to her and she pretty much told me to get fucked. She said had I not accepted the job search extension I would have had my care SUSPENDED for the summer but immediately started back up in the fall when I return to class. THIS WAS NOT MENTIONED TO ME OR I WOULD HAVE GLADLY AGREED TO STAY HOME WITH MY SON ALL SUMMER! I thought it was go to school, get a job, or lose daycare completely and go back on the waiting list and hope my name comes up by the time the fall semester starts. So I asked her my options and she said the only thing I can do is put my name back on the waiting list now, then she tells me the waiting list is at an 18 month wait right now and hasn't moved in months. GREAT. So I freak out for a couple hours. throw up, cry, etc. BUT I am not one to let things I can't change destroy me. So I decided I would just keep my son home with me, and take online classes so I didn't have to rely on daycare and when our name came up on the waiting list I would go back to taking regular classes, all the while still living on financial aid. 

Well, I just got an email from the financial aid office telling me that I was DENIED for student loans because I had to drop one of my classes this last semester and the semester before that. 

So now I have no daycare so I can't go get a job. I have no financial aid to live on or take classes with. I don't have any friends or family close that could watch my son while I work, and my bank account is at $0.21

What can I do here? Do I have any options left at all? I can't afford to just sit around and do nothing. I needed to go back to school. I needed to have daycare so I could work this summer and not be completely poor all the time anymore. I feel like I am drowning. 

Even worse is my son LOVES his daycare. He is a young toddler and he gets so excited every day to go to ""school"" and see his friends and teachers. He is so smart and loves to learn, and I have to take that away from him. 

I feel like the worst mother in the world. I feel completely broken. I am so lost and have no idea what I can even do at this point.

I know this was a ridiculous wall of text, but I just wanted to get it out and hope to God that someone out there on the internet has a suggestion for me.

It's things like this that make people turn to prostitution.

We utilized online services to simply text chat for about one (1) month, added each other on our person social networks and then turned to Skype for a good period of time a couple of days a week, and continue to Skype regularly. We've have cam sex via Skype (no charge), so I know she's not keeping me around as clientele and I truly believe in the connection we have. It feels like we've known each other for years, not months. I'm not going to lie, the relationship is going great except I've become to feel weird about her being a cam girl. Yes, I know, that's where I met her and I knew what I was getting into. She says what she does on cam is nothing more than a job and what we have is real. In her words, ""I'm in a whole other zone when I'm on there. There's no emotion. I don't even orgasm on cam."" I just wanted to air this out and try to get some help from people. Maybe other current cam girls or other that truly just believe in true love. 

Also, I've already had the discussion with her about how long she'd like to be a cam girl and if there is an exit plan. She says for about 2 years because she needs to get her feet under her and get out of a rough situation and this is a good flexible source of income.

I can't go to my personal friends because they wouldn't understand or just say ""WTF are you doing?"" I'm sure I'll get a few of those here too, but I am looking for your help Reddit.

Am I being selfish?,11,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1bys97/i_dont_want_my_boyfriends_friend_to_move_in_and/,"Long story short, my boyfriend and I are 21. One of his friends [almost 22] is in a really shitty situation. He has pretty much been tossed around from family member to family member since high school because his entire family is full of assholes who take advantage of him and take all of his money, and he can't get his feet on the ground to move out without a consistent home. [He has had to move states several times, and is now back in his home state.] My boyfriend wants to help him out by renting out our extra room to him, but I am pretty much uncomfortable with the idea of living with this guy. For one, he is extremely annoying, and I don't think I could handle his one-upping all the time, all the lies he tells because he always has to have the best stories, and listening to him spout bullshit about his wiccan beliefs all the time. I can handle him in small doses, but I learned over this weekend when he came to visit for two nights that I can't handle him all the time before I start to rage. On top of that, I'm a very possessive person. I don't like people touching my things, and the very idea of having a male in the house that could potentially sniff my underwear drawer, no matter how trustworthy he is, makes me want to vomit. I am fully aware that he had an attraction to me at some point. If he is still attracted to me, I do not know. I also don't want to give up on being alone with my boyfriend in our own house when we only just moved in together about two months ago. I'm ready to move on to adulthood, and I know if this guy moves in they will drink a lot on th weekends and it will feel like college again. I want to try for a child as soon as my doctor clears me for it. [Medical problems] On top of all of this, I found out this weekend he has a criminal record. Neither myself nor my boyfriend know the exact details. My boyfriend says he has an arson charge because of a small fire in the woods, and an assault charge because of a fight with his [asshole] father. However, when I was alone with the friend, he told me a completely different story. Supposedly when he was in high school some kid hit him playfully in the back of the head, which is apparently a trigger of some sort for him, so he broke several of his ribs. He is known for blatantly lying, and embellishing stories to make him sound as cool as possible. I'm not sure what to believe, as the judiciary search online has turned up nothing. My father is a cop and says he'll do what he can to find out, but he can't run a background check for no reason. I definitely do not want someone with a violent criminal record in my house, but if I find out they are basically bullshit charges, I don't know if I can convince my boyfriend it's not okay for him to move in, since at first I was okay with it. He wants to help out his friend in his shitty situation, and to be honest we could really use the extra rent money. Am I being selfish for not wanting the friend to move in, when I know without us he will probably end up homeless soon, for the second time?

EDIT: My main concerns are his assault charge, and my boyfriend and I remaining independent and being able to start our lives together without someone else's baggage.

I'm a junior in high school and I can't decide if I should attend my first prom.

I'm unsure because it is a pretty large expense (which my parents can afford with no trouble) but I would hate to feel like I'm wasting money if I don't enjoy myself. I don't have a very great relationship with my classmates; I really can't stand them. Another issue is that I get anxiety pretty easily from things like loud music or crowds. I imagine they'll play rap or country, which really kills the mood for me because I don't enjoy either of those genres.

My best friend convinced me to go today and it's late notice. All I ever do is sit at home by myself and I don't want to feel like I'm missing out. Sure, I have next year but I'm still undecided.

What was your experience with prom? Do you think it's worth attending?

I would genuinely appreciate your input. Thanks!

EDIT: and yes, I would have a date if that makes a difference.

EDIT 2: Thank you all so much for your advice! I decided to go after my friend made me feel more positive about it.

This job is not a shift-based job, either. We are permitted to clock in or out whenever we please. 
My boss claims he saw me leave work an hour before I clocked out.

I was fired (understandably, I guess). I’m also being charged for falsifying university records, and theft of property.

Also, I will be barred from ever having a job on campus, or in any way affiliated with the university.

Also, I will be placed on University Probation, meaning if anything else goes on my record for any reason, I’ll be removed from the university for life.

They made me meet with several people on campus, due to this ""Student code of conduct violation"". I have two choices now. I can either

*a. Accept the charges, admit responsibility for ""falsifying university records, and theft of property"", and accept the aforementioned consequences.*

**OR**

*b. Deny the charges, and appear during a court hearing with my boss, before a panel of law faculty, staff, and students, during which I will explain my case and argue for a different charge, or for the charge to be lifted. However, they also have the ability to make the charges **harsher** should I choose to deny, then be found guilty.*


**What makes it complicated:** My boss ""saw"" me leave ""over an hour early"", because he followed me. I know I left at 12:35 at the earliest, because I sent a Facebook message from my dorm at that time, telling my boyfriend I'd just gotten out of work. So, I did leave work and return to my dorm during my shift but it certainly didn't take an hour doing so. My coworkers often open up computer labs (with the code we use for WORK), and sit and watch YouTube videos for hours, yet I'm getting all these charges placed on me for ~20 minutes of time.

Other info:  I was paid 8.50 an hour. My (previous) coworkers all do the same job as me, but are paid 10, 12, and 14 respectively. I was the only female in this IT office. I'm nineteen years old.

What should I do, in your opinion? If you were in my situation? Accept or deny these charges? 

I'm not asking for legal help. I just want another opinion.

8 years ago, Lobster and I walked into the Lord &amp; Taylor store on Chestnut street in Philadelphia, with just over a hundred and twenty dollars in our pockets, hoping to buy an engagement ring for me. We were pretty broke college students, my family had just recently given us their blessings and we had scraped together what little money we had between the both of us to get a ring.

I was never someone who wanted that fancy diamond solitaire from Tiffanys, that wasn’t me. I had wanted something “Different”.. with a capital D. Something that you could look at and say, “Yup, thats definitely something Javi would love.” About half an hour later I walked out of Lord and Taylor, in love, for a second time (first being my then Fiance – Lobster).

My ring was PERFECT!

...

forward 8 years later and I found myself at the Lord and Taylor where I had given it in for cleaning and replacement, explaining to the store manager: I had trusted them with my ring going in for cleaning and possible stone replacement, and the repair center messed up the replacement stone, lost my original stone, then gave me a stone that wasn’t mine and tried to sell me on the idea that it was my original stone.

Apparently its okay to take a repair center's word for whether or not my stone is mine, but not mine

So basically around October/November of this year I did a little bit of experimenting with marijuana. I've always been kind of against drug use because the people I tend to see talking about it, wearing clothes with pot leaves, ect. are usually people that I do not like. Anyway, I know a few friends that had done it a couple times and said it was really fun, so I decided I would give it a shot. I'm generally a pretty good kid, by the way. Straight A student. Minimal alcohol use (at least compared to most seniors at my high school). I was just pretty curious about marijuana because of the fact that I'm a political junkie and had been reading a lot about it in light of the medical marijuana movement taking place in the United States. 

I smoked a total of three times, because I was told this had to be done in order to experience the full effect, or something I like that. It was mildly enjoyable, but I was pretty sketched out during the whole experience because I was afraid I would get caught. My friends made fun of me for my sketched-outness, and I basically decided that smoking was not for me. 

About a week/2 weeks later, my parents randomly confront me about smoking weed. I tried to lie my way out, which turned out to be a mistake, because apparently they had some way of knowing that I, without a doubt, ""smoked pot."" Eventually I gave in, telling them I had tried it before. Intense interrogation commenced, and I found my mom was actually accusing me of being a huge pot head that smoked all the time. Though I argued against this, they wouldn't believe me due to the fact that I lied to them off the bat. Anyway, this pretty much sets in stone the fact that I will definitely not be smoking again, and after several torturous weeks of grounding they eventually start to trust me again. 

Now, about a week ago, my mom accused me of smoking marijuana again. What. The. Fuck. I've been completely drug free since the first time they caught me, but somehow, some way, my mom has come to the conclusion that I am definitely smoking weed. I try my best to argue that shes wrong, but she hits me with things like ""why should I believe you?"" If anyone is going to tell me I shouldn't have lied in the first place, I get this now, because it has really come back to bite me. The kicker is that she WILL NOT tell me how she ""knows"" that I'm still smoking. So I can't even try to explain why her source is not valid because she won't tell me what it is. 

Eventually I just gave up on arguing with her as it was the Christmas season and I really didn't feel like dealing with this crap. That night, however, I'm shopping for Christmas presents in Walgreens (I know what your thinking, but if you go there during Christmas time they actually gave some really sweet stuff), and I see that they have home drug tests for marijuana. I get super psyched and pick one up. I was looking forward to just walking in the house like a badass and taking it right in front of them, but they were at a high school basketball game. Remembering that my mom didn't want my sister to know about the whole ordeal, I decided to just take it at home. I text a pic of the negative results to my mom with the words ""The proof is in the pudding."" Hell yeah! Badass move right? Wrong. My mom actually came to the conclusion that I only bought the test to see if I could pass it, and if I didn't I would have thrown it out. She also thinks that if I had smoked in the past week the weed would have been out of my system. Huge, huge backfire. 

Anyway, my mom said that we would continue with this altercation after Christmas. So Christmas is over, I'm waiting for the confrontation. What the hell am I supposed to say now?

I have seriously descended into an existential depression from which I can't get out of. I've just starting my second year of university and it's actually destroying me. I'm an arts major (I know this is reddit, boo arts majors) and it's the amount of time and effort that is required to be great at this is actually killing me. I've started seeing the world in another way that doesn't fit with everyone else's perception and it's causing me a lot of pain.

It all started when I realized how there was nothing particularly unique about me as a person. That I had the same interests and likes as a majority of people. It was kind of the realiziation that millions of people in the western world had had very similar upbringings as me and that we all were fed the same things growing up. People like video games, people like television, people like sports. Just a copy of a copy of a copy, and I was one of those copies. I also realized that most people I was going to school with didn't really care, they just did art because ""arts cool."" I started doing a lot of reading on what made the great artists of the past great. As it turns out it meant dedication and sacrifice even at the possibility. I began to realize that there is a huge amount of theory and philosophy that is required to be a good artist.

The theory and philosophy has pretty much consumed me at this point . I feel like I am meaningless, I'm stuck to many rows down in the chain of a society. I've been raised on mass media and commercialism which has blinded people to the real problems in the world and subjugated minds that would otherwise be free to think about and solve these problems. That my own creativity has been stifled because I was forced through a school system designed for mediocrity. That I live in a culture that has abandoned its heritage and tradition in favour of cheap thrills, and instant gratification. That democracy is a sham and that most people are too ignorant or apathetic to make an informed choice, or that powerful interests control a nations interests regardless. That I am just a member of the masses, and I have no real say or power and that my two choices are either become wealthy or sit down and accept it.

That it is difficult to become exceptional unless your parents had the money to send you to one of the best private schools or academies. That the poor still worship the rich for simply being rich (I'm canadian so the whole royalty thing offends me). That so few people hold themselves to a higher standard, or even think about any of these things. That they are just happy to keep on consuming and not think about what that means for their hearts and minds.

I also can't get over the feeling that I'm being controlled by popular media, and that if I cut myself off I will have to come back because I will be alone. I feel like I've been being poisoned my whole life and it is impossible to cut it out.

Commercialism makes me sick, I've given away or sold most of what I own. I return to how I saw things before, I was happy before. No one else takes anything seriously, everyone seems to just think things will happen for them without any effort put into them. We distract ourselves because real life is too awful to take, and we're too afraid to do anything to change it. I'm doomed to be a mediocre middle class nothing. I don't understand why people want material things it's not important. Human communication has been cheapened to shallow nothingness where no one cares about anyone.

There's probably no point to anything anyway, one day I'm going to die and nothing I ever did will have mattered in the grand scheme of things. This existence on this planet is just unimaginably powerful and wealthy people dominating the rest of the world through distraction and fear. There are only two options which is find a way to become powerful and wealthy or struggle to survive underneath. The real crux is that most people don't even think about this shit, most people are content with the way things are. It just makes me sick, it makes me physically ill. We're just a speck floating around in space, and there is nothing on this planet that will give me peace of mind.

To be honest, I think that this could actually kill me. It'll either kill me or I'm going to find a way to become wealthy so I don't have to play this game anymore. It all makes me fucking sick, and everything that I read supports me in this. Seriously if you read any philosophy or literature it amounts to this, that there is nothing you can do and you should lament it. I can't enjoy anything I used to, it's all so ugly and boring, video games, genre fiction, movies, pop music, it's all just interference. I don't know what to do, I've gone to see a counsellor, they said I should see a philosopher, but I'm too freaking anxious to do that. I've read all the literature on this I know my shit here. I'm losing people in my life because I can't get over this I need someone to help me.
I've receded into my own head, I only paint and write. I've been getting a lot of praise for my art, but I hate it.

TL;DR: In the midst of an existential crisis, I'm seriously having anxiety even using the internet right now because its a waste of time. I've lost all hope in my existence and everything is meaningless, I can't feel enjoyment from anything. I need someone to help me get out of this horrible thought loop.

Also, keep in mind, we were all hysterical finding out dog in the state that he was, we didn't think to do anything about it until AFTER the fact. 

On Monday night around 930 pm, it was the last time anyone had seen my 13 year old Yorkie. The dog, oh man, he was awesome. He slept under the covers with me every night, barked like a grumpy old man and licked the air, all day, every day. 

I get a text from my mom around 330pm on Tuesday asking if I had seen Puppy (we got real creative with his name) and I said I hadn't. She said no one had seen him all day. This is weird; very out of the ordinary. He NEVER in 13 years, left our property unless he was following me. I told her I would look for him when I got off work.

I arrived home around 5pm and got the urge to walk around to the grocery store. To give you an idea as to the lay out, behind all the houses on the east side of my street, there is an 8ft sound proof wall, then on the other side is about 10ft across of grass and bushes, a service road then the shopping complex. I walked over to the grocery store side of the wall. A couple house lengths down, I notice a rail, like ones bladders use to grind on. I went to go inspect because this was very out of the ordinary. As I was looking at it, something caught my eye. Right above me, in the bushes, was a white grocery bag. You could see fur and blood... then I saw it; his tiny little paw hanging out. I called my dad over to see if it really was him. After a few minutes, the only way to id him was by his tags. His neck was broken, body mutilated... he was NOT run over. He was intentionally beat then shoved in a bag then thrown into a bush. We buried him about 20 minutes later. 

What makes this worse is a week ago, my cat disappeared. Again, she didn't leave the confines of the property either

Anyways, what I'm getting at is, my 5 pound, innocent Yorkie was murdered. Besides going door to door and having the grocery store look at their security cameras (which they currently are) is there ANYTHING else I can do to get the police to investigate? Would it be a waste of their time due to the lack of evidence? I want closure and I want the bastard to go to hell. It is a felony in my state to abuse an animal, so if caught, the person will face prison time.

Hoping y'all can help out a bit because I don't want this to be like high school where I was known as the quiet kid. I changed that at the end of high school but it feels like I'm slowly reverting.

So yesterday after settling down in my dorm my roommate came in and we eventually ended up chatting with a few guys from the rooms next to us, both of them don't have roommates until Wednesday so we were glad to let them chill with us. They all left to get dinner with groups from a camp my college holds for incoming freshmen and I sat in my room for a few minutes to wait for this game night hosted by my dorm to start.

The game night was pretty fun, but my problem was that there were a bit *too many* people and I couldn't really start a semi-deep conversation while playing Apples to Apples, so I learned a few names last night but I'm honestly not sure if anyone will be recognizing me yet...

Woke up late this morning, roommate was gone, hopped on my laptop for a few, and then my suite-mate (who is still roommate-less) came in and invited me to lunch, so that was fun I guess. We just got back and now I'm typing this.

Ugh, so my whole concern here is that I just have no idea how I'm going to start small relationships at such a big school.

1373028081.0,10,self.Advice,1horya,"My (F20) relationship with my stepmother is passive aggressive, awkward, and generally uncomfortable. How do I repair 12 years of mutual disdain?",14,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1horya/my_f20_relationship_with_my_stepmother_is_passive/,"Hi Reddit. I was wondering if you could help me out a bit here, so that I can see where I'm going wrong (I'm aware that I definitely am going wrong, but I'm just not sure which steps to take)

Background information:

*  My dad has always worked in Norway. He would be away for 2 weeks, then back for a month. Was close to him as a child

*  My sister died of cancer, aged 10 

* My parents divorced as a result

* My dad stayed in Norway for longer and longer periods of time

* A year after they divorced he moved in with my (now) step mother

* They had a baby (born 2002)

* 2 years later they had another baby

* Dad saw me less and less as time went on

* I now see them about 3 times a year when they come over to the UK for family holidays (they have an inordinate amount of time off)

My dad is a money-orientated man, whereas my mother is not. I was brought up, from the age of 7, with the assumption that money was a means to an end - not the sole aim of life. My father earns a high salary, my mother is a teacher and does not. 
My stepmother (50) is also money-orientated, but lazy. She was living in a small flat before she met my father, and now she shares with him a house in Norway, a house in England, and a villa in Italy. She has hugely profited from the relationship.

Points of contention:

* She does not like that my father gives me financial support in order to get through university, and constantly urges me to get a job. I already find my studies difficult and time-consuming, and have managed to achieve high grades so far, as well as participate in extra curricular activities which will make me more attractive to the sort of employers I wish to impress (publishers). A retail or catering job would not help me in my pursuit of this career, and would make it harder to achieve in my degree. However, she thinks that I shouldn't be relying on my parents for support at the age of 20. On my 20th birthday, she quietly told me that 'next year you will be 21. Then you will have to support yourself'. 

* She is very impolite, and I find this difficult to stomach. She is extremely rude to waitresses, customer assistants, and serving staff in general. In general I bite my tongue, because our relationship is not strong enough to call her out on it. Despite having had her in my life for over 12 years. I find myself suppressing a lot of emotions because I am not brave enough to tell her that she's being entirely unreasonable - or I believe it isn't worth the argument. I also have this problem where my brain can't handle any kind of strong emotion and just sort of hotwires everything to my tear ducts. So I avoid confrontation. If I confronted her about one little thing, I sense that it could escalate very quickly into a screaming breakdown. They already know that I've had counselling about my relationship with my father, and when he said he wasn't going to be there for my 21st birthday I started crying on the phone. I think that they think that I'm a bit unhinged.

* She makes passive-aggressive/snide comments. She is judgemental. She gets irritated when I say 'your' family instead of 'our' family, when I don't mean anything by it, it's just a way of differentiating. She over analyses what I say and is overly sensitive. As am I. It makes for a bad match. 

* I have seen my father alone twice in 5 years. He always brings a child with him when he visits the UK because then it's 'fair' and it's 'nice for them' (her words) - but I want to spend time with him alone. I have expressed this, but he thinks of his family as a package deal. It hurts me immensely that he appears disinterested in spending time with me and getting to know me properly.

* My stepmother is loud and obnoxious - overpowering. She has an anecdote for everything and tends to dominate the conversation. I am not an introvert, but neither am I willing to compete with her. I tend to just let on with it. I find her opinions nauseating; she has some very ignorant views. She assumes that most immigrants are scroungers, and says generalised statements like 'All women without children are fundamentally unfulfilled' (how smug and self-satisfied can you get?!)
She's like the embodiment of a Daily Mail reader. I can't tolerate her. A part of me, a horrible, childish part of me, actively enjoys disliking her. The problem is my problem. And I need help knowing what to do. 

I find it hard to be nice to her because there's so much hurt there. I am hurt that I have been sidelined; that they not only have so much material wealth, but they have a family - a family unit that I never really had growing up. Seeing as they met and moved in so quickly, I also wonder if my father had an affair with my stepmother whilst still married to my mother. 

The person that I am when I'm around them is not me; I am sulky, incommunicative, and dull. I am, in part, destroying my own relationship with them by making them want to see me less and less. When I'm with them I just want to leave in case I burst into tears. I always cry when I get home after seeing them, and it's ridiculous. They're here for a week at the moment and I can't cope. When I see dad on his own/with the kids, it's fine! It's just her presence that puts me on edge. 

How can I repair this situation? A part of me just wants to walk away and not see any of them (which is what my brother did), but I can't really afford to until I've finished my degree. Walking away also seems cowardly and ineffective.

When I first joined these sites, I didn't really know much about them. I was pretty innocent. In retrospect, I realize these sites are dark places, and I would not recommend them for anyone.

One of my past partners has accused me of a crime that I have not committed - one of those crimes that gets you arrested without proof or a chance to deny it. I was arrested, searched, interrogated and all of my electronic equipment has been seized. For the next few months, everything about my life will be scrutinized by the law. 

They told the police that it related to when we were dating some years ago, but waited until now to tell anyone. The officers who spoke to me said they believed me and were very nice about everything, and I have no doubt that those who know me would stand beside me against this. I am currently in a very happy relationship with someone else but I am afraid to tell her what has happened because we haven't been together all that long. I'm afraid of talking to my family, my friends or my boss because I don't know what they will say or think.

I feel depressed, like someone has punched me in the gut and I can't get my breath back. I'm anxious around people I've known for years. I find it hard to work because all I can think about is how much I want to curl up and die, even though I know that I am innocent and that my ex is purely seeking attention. They are jealous of my happiness as they have not found the same for themselves. I'm adrift. I'm angry. I want to scream at the top of my lungs. I cannot cry. 

If anyone can relate or shine some light on what I can do, I would be most appreciative. Do I tell someone I know, or speak to someone who charges by the hour? I wake up in the morning and feel totally, utterly worthless and ashamed. I don't think I can last long on my own.

About a month ago my husband told me he wanted a divorce. I was shocked. I knew he was stressed out from work and had been less attentive than usual as of late, but I figured it would pass. He never indicated to me that I was the issue, and when I would try to talk to him he would just say he was tired. We were together 8 years, married for 5.

One day he was acting more distant than usual and I decided it was time to talk. I asked him to sit with me and tell me what was on his mind so we could try to work through it. He said he was stressed out from work. I asked him if he had considered getting another less stressful job, that even if it payed less we would find ways to get by. He got quiet...That's when I knew it wasn't his job.

He finally told me that he wasn't happy anymore. He felt like there was too much responsibility in his life and he needed a break from it all. That all he wants is to work, come home and watch tv not worry about anyone else...He thinks it would be nice to rent a house with several other guys and and move around after that. Maybe go to California or Texas...Be free basically. 

I didn't understand this at all...we had talked about getting a house, a subject he had been avoiding for several months at this point, and having kids. I do everything for him. I do all the shopping, cooking and cleaning on top of working a 40 hour overnight job. I thought I was doing everything right. We were best friends and he was my world...He told me he wanted to stay friends, that it wasn't my fault, that I hadn't done anything wrong...I begged him to tell me why, but he had no further reasoning.

He admitted that he had been thinking about divorce since Christmas, but had been unhappy for almost a year! I had no idea, no real indication...I find myself scanning over the last year trying to find the signs I should have probably seen along the way. I need closure but he won't give me any.

He originally told me he'd like to stay friends. I agreed out of sadness and a need to keep him in my life some way. He asked me to move out and I did. We kept in touch for a bit then last night he told me we needed to cut back on communications. He said he knew I was still looking for closure, and he also needed some kind of closure...then de-friended me on Facebook. 

I'm so confused....he doesn't want to be my husband anymore...and now not even friends even after asking ME to stay friends with him. He made such a big deal about how not having me in his life at all would be too hard. I haven't been harassing him or frequently contacting him, so why this sudden change... I feel like he is trying to erase me from his life. I just don't understand why he suddenly decided we can't even be acquaintances anymore.

I know I shouldn't care, but up until this point things had been pretty peaceful. I don't know what I'm looking for from this post, maybe just to vent. I just want to know why he would give up on us seemingly so easily and why the sudden change of heart about staying friends. I know no one here has the answers I am looking for, but I would like to know if anyone else has been through this or can relate and give me some insight... I was also curious if anyone out there that's been through this has been able to move on...I'm afraid I am too broken to ever find love and trust someone again...how could I?

I was admitted to a good university following High School (graduated in 2008, wtfbbq indeed) only required to take out a private loan for $6,000. My family is broke, so at the time this seemed like a great idea-- I'd take out private loans, graduate on time, find a career and pay it off in a matter of a few years. This fairy tale never happened. Instead, by the time I graduated High School, my father had abused my mom on a number of occasions, began abusing drugs, and had just become a general dickweed. Supposedly my mom had been cheating on him for 5 years, and he just found out about it, claims she was sending money to this guy and had a P.O box set up and such-- he also found a letter she wrote to the guy claiming that she would send him money once my father's lawsuit came through (in 2006 he fell 30ft on the job due to the malfunction of a safety mechanism, permanently disabled). My role in the house immediately became that of the peacemaker, but I would still wake up in the middle of the night to screams. On one occasion my mom barricaded herself in the bathroom with my little brother because my father was threatening to stab her with a knife (he was indeed holding a knife in his hand when all of this happened).

So the time comes for me to head over to Boston for school (I'm from NY). High school girlfriend also decides to go to school in Boston, life was great. Wrong. In a matter of two years, I spent close to a thousand dollars going back and forth between Boston and NY on the bus, and then taking the LIRR home, just to be home and make sure everything was ok. My high school girlfriend of 4 years cheated on me and broke up with me when I found out (pretty cool). GPA tanked and I lost my aid, so I was forced to withdraw from school. I headed home and enrolled in community college.

I don't have the most reliable means of transportation, since there is only one car at home and it's not always there when I need it, but my GPA was a 3.42 after 2 years. Of course it should be higher, it's hard to express just how much I care about my education, and how helpless and trapped I feel. I missed a week of classes during the Fall semester last year because I was in the hospital (developed an abnormal tachycardia after taking a pre-workout shake, found out that I have PSVT). Received 3 I.V injections of adenosine, made my heart rate drop from 180 to 40 instantly. Strangest sensation I've ever experienced. The entire time I had this really strong feeling of deja vu, as if I'd dreamt about the experience at some point. Psychological bullshit aside, I was expecting my heart to give out. After being reset by the paddles and having one of the most terrifying nights of my life, I started thinking about where my life would have ended (in terms of goals and achievements). I really want to visit Tibet. I also want to become fluent in French and Japanese. I want to become well-read in Philosophy and start considering reality as something more than the shitty life-grind that it's made to be. But look at me, I lose almost full-aid from what I thought was my best chance to escape all this non-sense, only to end up back in this shithole I call life. As soon as I was released from the hospital I called my old university in Boston, explained my situation again (the school was aware of my situation since the beginning, but my professors didn't suggest that I take a semester or two off, instead they told me to do my best and that they'd bare everything in mind. Turns out only a few ""remembered.""), asked for a little compassion, and after talking to virtually every dean and academic adviser there, I was cleared to be readmitted. My withdrawal was turned into a leave of absence. At my community college, however, I was forced to take a W from 2 classes because the professors wouldn't accept a signed letter from the hospital. They said that even though the absences will be counted as 'Excused,' it is still against school policy and will therefor be factored into the grading system. My other professors were completely understanding, and even though I had to take 2 Ws and missed plenty of classes, they graded me based on the merit of my exams and papers. I finished that semester with a 3.8, but had my aid revoked because I was below the minimum credit requirement. I didn't really care though, because the day I found out I could go back to Boston was the happiest day of my life. I know reading it doesn't sound like shit, but it meant the world to me. I had another chance and nothing to hold me back. I'm happily single, things at home aren't perfect, but they're well enough for me to feel comfortable being away without receiving heart-wrenching phone calls from my little brother. I'm slated to return this upcoming Fall, I have a dorm assignment and everything. Here is the catch though. After filing an appeal for financial aid, I am still going to need to pay at least $8,000 out of pocket. I can't afford to take out anymore private loans. I have considered growing shrooms, but I don't want to risk falling into a deeper hole. I'll be working as much as possible over the Summer, and I'll probably be able to scrape $2,000-$3,000 together, but there's no way I'll come up with enough. I've been applying for as many scholarships as possible, but I'm not too excited about my college transcripts. My High school stats were great, scored really well on the SAT, but my intellectual capabilities are in no way reflected in my college career. There has to be something I can do to keep this dream alive. Any advice would be appreciated. I know it's a long post, and most people will probably stop reading after the first few sentences, but I could really use some life advice right now. I'm just a kid with a dream trying to escape the past.

I am 40 and have always been terrible with public speaking.  My speech was predictably awful.  I heard silence and awkward coughs.  Here's some things I wish I would have said:
Do something you enjoy everyday, but don't only do the easy stuff in life.
Push yourself to do difficult things, but if it is excruciating again and again, maybe you're not meant to be doing it.
Be a producer or creator of things sometimes, not just a consumer.
Remove those people in your life who are toxic.  But think very hard about this one.  If they challenge you sometimes, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  If they don't accept you for who you are, cut them out.
Express your style and point of view.  Do this as much as you like when it comes to your appearance, but don't ram your opinions down others' throats.
Save up money for things you covet, big or small.  Without goals and something to look forward to in the future, life becomes mundane.
Humour is fun when you're young, but it's absolutely essential to life when you're an adult.
Every relationship can have value.  They don't all have to be forever.  Appreciate what they do give you, even if only for a limited time.
Think for yourself.  In this age of social media and opinions galore, don't get sucked in to following popular opinion.  But if it seems like everyone around you is in to or excited about something, check it out.
Don't be afraid to stand out.  Saying or doing things to create discord does not come from a good place, but speaking out when you truly believe in something, can create great beneficial change.
Do something nice for your partner/lover/friend/family you live with, every day.  Small, but thoughtful, goes a long way.
Treat every new person or stranger with respect.  Strangers do not have to earn your respect.  They've done nothing to you.  Go away to another town or country or place if you want to or need to, but don't run away.
Replacing family with a new family will really hurt your original family.  Greatly consider whether this is the right choice, and if you don't have room for both.

Right now its 10:30am, 12 hours earlier at 10:00pm my girlfriend asked to run up to her friends house, grab something and come right back.

I say my girlfriend, but were in the middle of breaking up (It's been drawn out a lot, this is the third day of talking/discussing if we're actually going to break up.) We've dated for three years and she's lived with me for two, so I wasn't worried about letting her use my car.

Now, the first time I tried calling her (30 minutes after she left, she said she was there and going to be leaving soon.) An hour and a half later I tried calling and texting her, both of which got ignored. As time went on and still no answer I tried calling, hanging up, calling right back, hoping it would annoy or piss her off enough to answer. Her phone is off now. Going right to VM.

This is a big problem for me, I have appointments, work and I needed to go the bank so I could pay a bill.

Now 12 hours later, no calls from her, her phone is back on but she isn't picking up and she still has my car.

So my question is, should I report it to the police?

Need some help figuring out what's the BEST way for me to pay down my credit card debt: I have four credit cards, totaling around $7000 of debt ($1000, $1000, $1800, $3000) and I will be receiving a very good bonus for the end of the year. This bonus should be enough to cover the *full* amount.

Anyways, my question is this: would it be best for me to settle the accounts, as they are already sold off to collectors, and then apply for a secured credit card to start rebuilding my debt, or would it be smarter to pay back my full amount and work with the banks to rebuild my credit... I guess my question is if there is any benefit to paying the original bank off or is the damage already done and I should take the best deal and start rebuilding anyways?

So my boyfriend and I had been dating for about 4.5 years. We went to high school together and then later moved to Chicago for college. I moved first and he moved about a year later transferring schools. We dated the year we were apart and the entire time we were in college. After graduation, he got an internship in Nashville and decided to move there because he works in the music industry and it was a better suit for him. He offered for me to come with him, but, me working in art and design I didn't think Nashville would hold many opportunities, so I decided to move to New York. Part of me decided to move here because I knew there would be more job opportunities, the other part of me just loved the idea of being in New York.

After I moved to New York though I realized how much I missed him and how incredibly lonely and depressing it can be living in a city where you don't know anyone. I like the city, but without a job or school (and as a fairly shy person) meeting people is not easy. After spending about two weeks here I decided I would move to Nashville to live with my boyfriend again in October (that was the soonest I could get out of my current rooming situation in New York).

As it turns out, I got a call for a job which I applied to before I even moved to New York (when the dream was still alive and thriving). The job is fairly high paying for someone fresh out of school like myself and with a company that I would like to work for. Throughout school I was terrified of never being able to find a job, but now that actually seems possible. I went in for the interview and I have a second one coming up, meaning there's a much higher chance of me actually getting this job.

We thought about trying doing a long distance relationship, but it seems sort of senseless if the end is indefinite, so now I must choose between my (currently nonexistent) career or the only person I've ever had a real relationship with. So, yeah. I wasn't sure of this was a relationship question or an all around life question, so sorry if this seems like it's in the wrong place. Any advice on this situation would help.

Why is this a problem?  She is the most judgmental, critical person I know.  She has criticized my every move since I was a child: my behavior, my looks, my weight, my personality, my grades, you fucking name it.

Because of Reddits anonymity, I used it as a diary of sorts, especially in AskReddit.  There were details of my sex life, drug and alcohol use, eating disorder, the time I got raped (which I don't talk about in real life) and just general other personal stuff.  

My mother and I are not close.  The fact that she has been reading this the whole time feels so incredibly violating.  She tends to use information she finds out about me (and even things I confide in her) as blackmail, threatening to tell the rest of the family about it if we have an argument or if she's trying to force me to do something.

You are not safe.,10,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jkpu5/capital_onebad_business_you_are_not_safe/,"I have had the worst experience with Capital One. I wish to let all who bank with them know, you are not safe. I have been with them for almost three years and then BOOM they got me. I always pay online through their system. This time my payment was not accepted. They say for Non Sufficient Funds. This was not true. I had verified with my bank that the funds had indeed left the bank and payed to them. They tried two additional times to debit my account which did result in my being overdrawn.CapOne acted like I did not make the payment and that I was a bad customer for trying to lie to them (Jason@CapOne). I spent over a month fighting with CapOne about where my money went. They claimed I never payed. I had in fact made another payment as to not have a negative report on my credit. After numerous calls and having my bank go far beyond expectations to help me (Thank you InTouch Credit Union). I finely got someone to believe me (Thank you Norma Flores@CapOne)and help track down my money. By the way while this is happening I have traded this car in and bought a new one. When we found the money it was posted to someone's credit card account(Not mine). I asked to have the funds back. It would take 4 days and instead of giving it to me they posted it to my credit card which way overpaid my account. I had to make yet more calls to get the balance sent to me. Now that was cleared up I thought my troubles were behind me...NOPE! Now all of a sudden I am 120 days late and they are coming to repo the car. You know the one I had already traded in. I had in hand every single payment I had ever made to CapOne. This was not true. I was now being pursued by CapOne as a delinquent account and they were going to close and mark my credit. I actually found this out from the dealer who was trying to payoff the loan per our deal. The dealership called me in a quite a crazy manner saying that CapOne told them I was 120 days behind and I do not make my payments and they need possession of the car. Again I hold the documentation that this is false( Thanks Bree@CapOne for lying about me and telling someone who is not me my information) way to go in customer security Bree. My account has now been seriously screwed up by CapOne. Creative accounting I call it. They now say that I was 120 days late and that I owed more than I did. Now here we go. I called more than 50 times, no exaggeration. They do not believe me again. I have sent them all the documents from my bank that I have in hand that prove other wise. Turns out they had been deleting my payments and rejecting others. I have now since gotten that taken care of. My point here is to tell my story and let you know how lax security is to CapOne and its never their fault. YOU AND YOUR MONEY ARE NOT SAFE HERE!!! I have closed all of mine and my fiance's accounts and vow to never bank with CapOne or any of its affiliates ever again. By the by CapOne SELLS ALL of your info. I hope this finds you fellow CapOne bank users and hope that you do not have this experience.

We have two beautiful children together and two years ago moved from Los Angeles (where we were both born and raised) to New Orleans.  The decision was based partially for work reasons and partially because my wife adores the city and she told me she would be happy here.  The last year or so my wife became increasingly unhappy in our marriage due to the fact that I am not exactly Mr. Wonderful and I am gone a lot for work as well as dealing with 2 young kids while I am away can carry a lot of stress.  She recently told me that she wanted a trial separation and we would do marriage counseling to see if she wanted to stay in the marriage.  Seeing other people was never put on the table, but I did say that she needed to figure her own stuff out without taking me into consideration (my mistake).  I moved into a short term situation then we proceeded to meet at counseling once a week.  In addition, I was seeing a therapist but she wasn't due to time/work constraints.  We had been living apart for about a month and all was going okay.  I came and went from our house when she wasn't around to pick up things for the kids/drop stuff/etc.  She was working so many hours that I even would drop off groceries to make sure her and the kids were well fed.  I came into the house one day and an ipad we share was on the bed, I picked it up and opened it and there was her facebook open with a chat log speaking with her best friend/mutual friend about a guy she was sleeping with.  Needless to say I went ballistic.  I ripped up every picture of her and I together, I wrote a nasty note, took off my wedding ring, put it on a knife and stuck it through the note into the pillow.  Texted her to go to hell, she called, at first denied then admitted it.  I emailed her that she was dead to me then emailed her terms for a divorce the next day.  My world collapsed around me.  I lost control, and for anyone that knows me it is not in my nature, I am extremely calm, never hurt a fly kind of a person who had been extremely loyal and faithful throughout our marriage and there were opportunities for me to cheat without anyone finding out.  I then got drunk with some buddies a couple of nights later and called her up.  We spoke and agreed to meet up at the house the next night and talk.  I was ready for battle.  I wanted so much to tell her to go to hell and die, that I never wanted to see her ever again, that I couldn't believe or trust her again.  Then common sense took over.  This is the woman I had spent the last 15 years with and 90% of the time had been great.  We have 2 beautiful children together and we had built a life.  I changed tactics, I knew there was a great bottle of champagne in the fridge...As I entered the house, I walked straight past her right into the kitchen, grabbed the bottle, pulled out our wedding champagne flutes, poured us each a glass and drank a toast to ""if this is the end, lets end it like it began, with our first date and a bottle of champagne"".  We then proceeded to talk non stop for 3 hours mostly like civilized adults, (I got a bit crazy a couple of times).  She wouldn't tell me who the guy was, just that it was only sex and it was over, never to see him again.  From our talk I realized and accepted my part in why she cheated.  It was the best and most honest talk in our entire marriage.   I realized why I married her in the first place.  I changed from wanting to end the marriage to wanting to fight and save it.  She had her reasons, I have my faults, she has her faults but at the end of the day, we have a bond and a love that is stronger than a fling.  The problems are still there, we are still working out a lot of issues, I have to get over the fact that she was with someone else and I have to get over finding out who it is and how to exact revenge, because the truth is, anything I would want to do to him,  I would actually need to do to my wife as it wasn't his fault, it was hers.  She chose him, he didn't choose her, so actually he is innocent in all of this and he doesn't even know I exist or anything about me.  I know every situation is different, every marriage is different, but for me the choice was either very simple and easy and a cowards way out to just end the marriage and go our separate ways for good.  Who's to say if there were no kids involved I wouldn't have?  But staying in a marriage just for the kids does one a big disservice.  You and your spouse need to be happy.  Life is too short to be miserable and in a miserable marriage.  The kids adapt to the change, just show them as much love as you can and don't use them as pawns against the spouse.  Feel free to freak out, break something, scream, cry, curse..etc. to help purge the immediate hurt and shame you feel.  Just remember that once that part ends, take a good look at yourself and examine what factors lead up to pushing her/him to cheat?  I am sure upon reflection, you will see that you are responsible for a lot of it.  (not in every case, there are plenty of spouses who are just cheaters and for those, you should open your eyes and have known when you said ""I do"".).  But for those in normal circumstances especially with kids, please try and look at both sides.  My wife is like a guy in the fact that she can separate sex from emotion.  There was no intimacy with this other person, it was just filling a void and it was a much younger guy which was partial to the fact that she had just hit 40 and mid life crisis which played a small role in this.  Anyway, we put a timeline to the end of September to either get back or end it, and its a tall mountain to climb, but hopefully we can work it out and hopefully those who bother to read this in similar situations, can take a beat before ending their marriage.

I have a friend who I have known for years. He is my best friend, basically, but mostly because I'm not great at making friends. He is very outgoing and I'm introverted. The problem is that over the years I have been used and discarded by this guy a lot. I've always had the best time with him when we are together and he's not in the process of being an ass, but when he decides there is someone more important - most of the time some hot chick - he trashes me, makes me feel worthless and used. He never really abandons me and says I'm imagining things, but I know I need him out of my life. He's toxic. 

My question is, how do I do it? I've tried getting away from him in the past, but I always get roped back in when he's nice to me. I've written him a letter that would give him a clear message (not yet sent), but it's a bit hurtful, and I don't want to be a bad guy, because I'm still friends with his family, and we might still see one another. If I just tell him we can't be friends anymore, he won't understand and just say I'm imagining things again. Help?

On Friday night, he stayed up all night playing some game on his computer, went to bed at 5 a.m. on Saturday, and slept till 5 p.m., only to wake up, game some more, go eat dinner, then game for most of the rest of the night (although not as late as Friday night). Then last night (Monday night) he stayed up all night gaming and went to bed at 7 a.m. this morning, knowing full well that we had class together at 12:45 (I didn't wake him up when I was leaving at 11 because I figured that he would get himself to class, like every other day so far). I go to class, and he doesn't show up for the entire 3 hours. This is an especially big problem because today we were doing group presentations on a topic, so when he didn't show his group got really pissed at him, and even more so when I told them that he was probably still asleep because of last night.

Sure enough, I go back to our room after class and he's *fast* asleep. I wake him up and this is our dialogue:

Me: Do you have any idea what time it is?

Him: (no answer, still waking up)

Me: It is currently 4:20 in the afternoon. You slept through all of today's class and your entire group presentation. Your group's pissed.

Him: Oh, shit.

Me: Yep.

Him: shit shit shit, fuck, okay, fuck, ahhhhgg, shit (mildly apologetic/worried)

Then he frantically decides he's going to wake up, and goes to take a shower. Guess what? He comes back and starts gaming again. Tonight he missed dinner, which means that he hasn't eaten in 24 hours (other than candy), and probably hasn't drunk very much, either.

I know that this is all entirely his fault, but I'm kind of worried about him. I'm leaving on Thursday so there's not much I can do, but I felt like I at least needed to post this :/

EDIT 1: He just brought back a sheep heart from the lab. We were doing dissections of sheep hearts and brains in class today, and he decided to bring one back (I didn't hear why). It is important to note than organs destined for dissection are soaked in a preserving chemical called formaldehyde, which also happens to be mildly cancerous. He brought this thing back with his bare hands, and was handling it pretty carelessly, considering I had food on my desk. After I helped him find all of the blood vessels of the heart, he realized that he needed to dispose of it ""somehow"", and he was reluctant to walk all the way back to the lab to dispose of it properly.

We're all 16.",8,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g7vpu/my_girlfriends_best_friend_whos_also_one_of_my/,"So I've been dating this girl for just over 7 months. She used to go out with this boy when they were 13, but they're just friends now. Well they're very close friends. She told them a while ago, before i started dating her, that nothing could ever happen between them, and now they're best friends. I used to be really close with him too, he was one of my best friends but recently we've kinda drifted apart.
  Anyway, exams started about a month ago. Just before the exams, she told me that he would be moving in with her. I found this pretty weird, but he didn't want to live with his mum's boyfriend and she was the first person he went to. I didn't want to intrude and make a big fuss about it, after all he was a pretty good friend of mine at the time. I don't get to see her a lot in school but I usually see her on the weekends, but she said we won't be able to hang out because she's revising. I understood as I was revising too. 
  We haven't actually spoken properly since then. Even during the week off we had, whenever I was available, she came up with an excuse as to why I couldn't see her. During this week off we had, he had apparently moved back to his mum's, but according to a friend of mine he was still going round hers. Even on the days she said she was unavailable for me to see her.
  I'm pretty calm and easy going, so when people came up to me asking me if I was bothered I'd just tell them that I trust both of them and that I have no reason to be suspicious, when really I was really paranoid and was 90% sure something was going on between them, I know that he's the kind of person that wouldn't hesitate to go for it. 
  So I had been expecting her to break up with for a while, but when I spoke to her the other day, she was acting perfectly normal, though she did tell me that everything would go back to normal once the exams have finished. My close friends have told me that they've gone off him since he moved in with her. One of the annoying things is that he's acting completely normal about it, as if he can't see that he's doing anything wrong. As if it's ok to just move in with one of your closest friends girlfriend. As well as living with her, he also spends 99% of his time in school with her.

Like, not just in the hotel, but why do I exist? what is my purpose? I've done nothing with my life and I don't know what i want to do with it. I've been trying to find a job but no place will hire me because i have no experience in any of the positions available to me (I have experience in a recording studio I used to work at) but other than that no experience at all in the work place. I could barely handle living through high school (lets just say i wasn't doing well in life while in high school) so college is out of the question. It seems my life is meaningless. Anyway, all of this dawned on me while i was sitting alone in my hotel room and i just broke down crying. I had an anxiety attack earlier that day but it wasn't nearly as bad as this. I broke down crying, hyperventilating, all i could as was ""why am I here"" ""why do I exist"" ""is there any place for me to fit in"" ""what is my purpose here"" ""do i even have a purpose"" and things of the sort. I had a few ativan (1mg total which is twice what I used to be perscribed) earlier to deal with the anxiety attack from before so I only had a .5mg after that and that did little to help. After praying for a little bit i eventually started calming down a bit. I wasn't suicidal. It was worse than anxiety attacks that i've had. I've never had one that bad before, and i've had a lot (hence my band name Anxiety Attack! and my username which comes from my band name). could this have been an existential crisis and if so is there any way for me to deal with it now? i haven't felt right since yesterday, emotionally and mentally.could anyone help me out? i'm just really looking to find out if what i had was just a really bad anxiety attack or if it was an existential crisis and if it was, is there anything i can do about it right now?

I know it doesn't sound like a fun career goal, but its something I think I'd enjoy.

Anyways, here's the issue: My gf, whom I've been with for over a year and love immensely doesn't support the notion of me becoming a cop at all.  Her arguments are that its dangerous and cops generally have no friends except for other cops.  She says we'd be watched at parties and it just would be an awkward career path.

Right now I work at a software development company, making less than enough to live on my own.  Its not what I wanted to do, I got taken by ITT Tech when I graduated highschool. My parents wanted me to go to college, so I grabbed ITT Tech just to shut them up.  Plus, I didn't have to do any work to get in or pass.

So yeah, here I am at a dead-end job where I should be writing help docs, gained 100lbs in a year, and just stopped caring. I'd much rather have a more adventurous job that pays more and being an officer sounds like fun.  But she won't have it and has said she'd have serious problems dating a cop. Doing so might even lead to a breakup. I love her a lot. I don't know what to do.  I guess just find some other bitchwork and work there for a living. :/  I think I'd want a future and a family and all with this girl more than I'd want to be a cop. I dunno.

I know in my heart what I WANT to do, but I have so far been able to keep myself on the straight-and-narrow...  To summarize.

I've been with my current GF for about 2 months now.  I have been completely faithful to her.  Sounds normal, right?  Well here's where it gets choppy!  She was my first girlfriend, ever.  The girl I lost my virginity to.  The first time we dated, it was for 3 and 1/2 years, and I never cheated on her once, I never even thought about it.

But then, after 3 and 1/2 years (literally to the day), I found out she was cheating on me with my best friend (I walked in and caught her in the act, after having suspicions and asking for the last month or so), and had been for MONTHS.  Well I obviously broke it off with her.  It broke my heart.  I didn't even speak with another girl (in any sexual way at least) for a good 6 months.

Well then I got bad off on cocaine (for unrelated reasons), and several other drugs (codeine, meth, ecstasy) and became a total whore.  I'm totally clean now (STDs and drug-wise, lol).  Turns out I'm pretty charming (or not very picky) when I'm fucked up.  Anyway, I've slept with tons of girls in the two years we've been broken up.

Here's the problem, me and her reconciled and met up one day so she could give me some of my things back (after two years, WOW!).  Anyway, talked about life, shit that had happened, started hanging out, and now we are dating again.  I decided against my better judgement to give it another go, though I've always thought ""once a cheater, always a cheater.""  But even though I am happy being with her again, I still have the same urges I was fulfilling when we were broken up.  So far I've had 3 opportunities to have sex casually and managed to turn them all down, but I don't know how long I can last.  I really do love this girl, she was my first love, nothing will change that, but still my feelings linger.  I never felt like this the first time we were together (puppy love?), but now every time a girl propositions me I want to just take her out to her car and fuck her down.

Part of me rationalizes it as me wanting to get back at her, another part says it's just because I became sexually indiscriminate during our ""apart-time"", and yet another little nugget says I'm an idiot for taking her back, regardless of whether she is sincere or not.  But she is the ONLY girl I ever loved, the others I just looked at as a piece of ass.

Also, she currently doesn't want to have kids, I want to have kids (several).

As a side note, she watches my reddit username like a hawk, so I'm posting this on Legendary Mode.  All views accepted, I'm just looking for wisdom.

I dreamt that my wife tried to hurt me by divorcing me.  I was laughing to my friends about it because my freedom was what I had wanted all along.  When I woke up and realized what I had been dreaming about the breakup, it really disturbed me.

We have been fighting a lot lately and the divorce card has been dropped by both of us.  She says that she feels I am just looking for a way out.  Now I think she might be right.  I keep telling myself I can keep this going, but if I'm honest she's not who I want to be with.  In fact, I don't really want to be permanently tied to anyone.

I dread dealing with this problem.  I keep coming up with excuses not to, but I think I have to.  When I allow myself to consider how I would feel if I was free again, I feel exhilarated and almost instantly want to start improving myself.  If I think about staying in this marriage, I get depressed and just want to watch TV.

I feel terrible about the loss of her family.  I am really close to her mom and dad and I know I'm going to lose that, not to mention that my wife is pregnant.  One of the excuses I give myself is that I'll stay around until the baby is born so that she won't be stressed during the pregnancy.

Dead end jobs, pointless long term relationship, was unhealthy etc. This past year I woke up and started getting my act together. Started reading about fitness, taking better care of myself, a lot of self help stuff etc.

My issue now is this. I was abused growing up and I never had an adult I could trust or to teach me anything about life. I've had to google almost every concept that exists to find out how it works. I can't really google complicated subjects though. My obstacles are:

Money
Education
Health care

I need glasses, I need braces, I need check ups, I need basically a full package health insurance. I can't really afford that. If I somehow got that together I couldn't afford taking less time off my 2 jobs to start going to college. I work within walking distance from home because I can't afford a car+gas+auto insurance, even with a slightly better job that pays more, and I don't even know where I'd try to apply to.

My parents are not pleased. Now I'm transitioned and fully living as a woman. Now my parents are even less pleased. 

My current job is in my field and is a valuable resource in gaining me entrance into my major in the vocational world. It's through my university. I have to be a student in order to be employed there. It's basically my dream job. I'm currently 20 years old. I have attempted to file a dependency override last year, but they turned down the override because my cell phone is under their plan (one that let's you grandfather in a family member for $10 extra) and I am currently on their insurance, against my will. I asked multiple times to have both of these cancelled, to no avail. 

So if I don't get my FAFSA signed by March 10, I will be removed from my job, all of my educational loans will be due for payment, I will have an incomplete education, and I could very well lose my apartment. I'm so scared of this. What should I do? My tuition for next year will most likely be around $9-10K and I obviously can't get a co-sign on a loan. I have no other family and I don't know what I can do to continue my education. I'm a decent student. I am good in my field, but my parents are actively discriminating against me in order to teach me a lesson for changing my gender. 

I do, however, have a Female to Male boyfriend of 3 years. If I were to get married, I would be able to be an independent on my FAFSA, but I don't really feel like getting married. What else can I do?

What to do?,10,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/171qrp/15_year_old_that_hasnt_been_to_school_in_almost_2/,"My brother is currently 15 years old (turned 15 in Oct), and he hasn't gone to school since around 7th grade (can't exactly remember). The reason he stopped going was A) because he had an extremely hard time at school, B) he stabbed a kid with a pencil and the bullying just got worse and C) because my mom doesn't want to take him anymore. My dad had died of lung cancer around the time he stabbed the kid with the pencil, which I can only imagine was because he got bullied daily and he took the death of my father (and still does) really, really hard. He had always had a hard time in school, to the point that he was in literally every elementary school in our town. He was always sort of disinterested in school  and the fact that he never (ever) had any friends probably contributed to it. My mom doesn't want to take him anymore because she owes ~$8,000 on her car and she's deathly afraid they're going to repo it away (with good reason), she also got MY car taken away (but that's a whole different story).

So my question is, what do we do? What options does he have? He's obviously already too old to go back to 7th grade, and he's way too far away from getting his GED. I mean, he can't NOT go to school for another 3 years.

Thanks.

EDIT: Forgot to add that we're in a border town, and we spend most of our time in Mexico. Which is why my mother hasn't gotten her car taken away. Also my mother ""can't be fucked"" home schooling him ""he has to get shit going by himself, if he didn't want to put effort into school in the first place that is his fault"".

1355337958.0,8,self.Advice,14qkjv,Does this sound like scam or am I just being paranoid? (job offer),8,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14qkjv/does_this_sound_like_scam_or_am_i_just_being/,"First things first: I came across a job listing on craigslist. It was for an office management position for a company looking to expand to my city. Although unqualified, I decided to inquire about it anyway and shot them an e-mail with my resume attached. Fast forward to the very next day and I get a phone call. A pleasant sounding woman whom I assume is a secretary for the company tells me that they are conducting interviews the following morning at 10 AM and tells me to bring along my resume. She seems sweet and even jokes with me about how she has a cold. Anyway, I agree to meet for the interview the next morning at an office building downtown. 5th floor. Be early.

I arrive at said office building this morning, dressed to impress, and, as suggested, 15 minutes early. Upon arrival I am horrified to realize that I forgot my resume on the kitchen table at home. Oh, well.. I'll improvise and see what happens. Keep in mind I also don't have a cell phone on me because my sister accidentally took it to her boyfriends house. Back to the story.. I take elevator to fifth floor where I'm immediately brought to a receptionist who asks me my name, and tells me to have a seat while I wait. It's pretty clear to me that this is not the office building for the company who is interviewing me. I assume they rent out the rooms strictly to conduct interviews and meetings. That alone seems fishy, but hell, I don't know much about these procedures. Maybe that's what a lot of companies do.

After about 10 minutes the receptionist tells me that the people I'm scheduled to meet with are conducting interviews at the moment and will be a little late. So I end up waiting almost 40 minutes in the lobby before a heavy set man in a suit walks over to me. He appears to be of Indian decent, but is very well spoken and professional. No accent to speak of. He apologizes for the wait and says that the man I was supposed to interview with has had a few set backs and was running late, but asks why I didn't answer my phone. I explain to him my situation and he is very understanding. He informs me that his boss attempted to call me and reschedule, but that he would just interview me himself instead.

He leads me to an empty office and asks me to have a seat. I inform him that I do not have my resume with me and he doesn't seem to mind much. He instead asks me to tell him about myself. I go on to explain my job history and such, bur all the while he seems more interested in telling ME about their company rather then having me explain to him MY job history, philosophy, and credentials. He does occasionally ask me standard interview questions such as how I would handle certain situations, how I've handled things at previous jobs, but overall I would say he did about 75% of the talking during the interview. Explaining what his business is about and what would be expected of me.

He tells me that he works for HSE, a company that specializes in Safety in the work place. They make special fire extinguishers, security cameras, GPS watches, ect. I am told that they are looking to expand to my city and that they need a Manager to oversee their daily operations at the office they intend on opening. He tells me that I would be in charge of hiring and firing, I would work 5 days a week, I choose whether to work 9-5, 10-6, 11-7, or whatever I feel comfortable with, but that the job is still very serious. He even goes on to tell me that, while a degree would help, that they're really more concerned about finding someone who has the leadership and responsible qualities needed for the job. So being inexperienced wouldn't be a major deal.

Here is where it gets fishy. Towards the end of the interview he informs me that, before I could ever be hired, they would have to train me. He goes on about how training is not easy, but it's crucial to my success. He tells me there will be lots of homework and presentations and things of that nature. The only issue is that training costs $200. He explains to me that they charge for the equipment and other necessities that are provided during the training process. I was under the impression that most businesses pay YOU for training. Anyway, he then tells me that if I finish training in less than a week I would be given $1,000 for completing training. However, if it takes me more than a week, I still get $800. Finally, he says if it takes me any more time than that, I should consider doing something else and we share a laugh.

According to him, I would be on a salary. 750 dollars a week. I would not be required to take any of my work home and I would have weekends off. They feel like work should be left at the business place. We wrap up our interview with him asking if I had any questions, which I did. I asked him about 2 or 3 more questions, to which he did give me very informative and detailed responses. Either his business is legit or he is a very calculated and prepared scam artist. I finish up my questions and he says he still has to talk to his superiors, of course, but that I should expect a call tonight with regards to my status and training details. He does say that the 200 dollars would be required tomorrow and that they would give me more information in the phone call tonight. 

The entire time he seemed way more concerned about informing me about the company and job description than me giving him 200 dollars. He mentioned the money just once and didn't make a big deal out of it. I didn't feel like I was being scammed at the time, but looking back on it, this all seems to good to be true. I had no phone, no resume, no experience and he was still very interested in me. He supposedly works for a big company, but doesn't seem to mind that I'm under-qualified as far as credentials go. I was very professional and did make a very good impression on him by being well dressed, well spoken, keeping eye contact, and giving very good answers, but would a growing company really take a chance on someone as under qualified (credential wise) as I am ?

How can I deal with this in a ladylike manner?,9,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14prpf/my_friends_girlfriend_is_mean_to_me_when_we_all/,"Hello Reddit! I am an avid user but this post will be under a throwaway account because the people involved also use Reddit. I am female, early 20's. Everyone involved is early to mid 20's.

One year ago I made a new group of friends at a social gathering. One guy in particular caught my fancy and we went on a date. It went very well, and I had a good feeling about potentially continuing to date him. But a few weeks later I moved to a new town (not that far away, about an hour) and it became apparent that he wasn't interested in anything long distance. Fair enough. I continue to hang out with him and our friends when I am in their town visiting and we all get along very well. The guy I went on a date with quickly acquired a new girlfriend. This didn't bother me and I was happy for him. I figured: he's a cool guy, his girlfriend is probably cool too. 

Low and behold, she proves me wrong. The first time we met she never said hello to me or even glanced in my direction. I tried to be friendly and start conversation with her but she glared and ignored what I said. Now I am not sure if she knows I went on a date with her boyfriend, but if she does, it was only one time and it was at least two months prior to them dating. We are exclusively friends and nothing inappropriate has ever happened between us.

Now the second part. I can't give away too much information but I will do my best. I was in town on my birthday and my friends wanted to hang out. So we went out, and she was there. She didn't say hello to me when I greeted her. The entire night she glared at me, clung to her boyfriend, and gave me weird looks when I would crack jokes. She essentially treated me like I was some socially inept freak and humiliated me.. on my birthday. Towards the end of the night she began to verbally berate me (such as, ""what the hell is she talking about?"" after I would make jokes or comments to my friends.)

Reddit, I'm a very friendly, socially outgoing girl and all my friends obviously enjoy my company so I know I am doing nothing wrong.. especially when I make nice attempts to chat with her or even say hello. So my question for you is: in the future, how can I deal with her mean attitude without being too harsh or sinking to her level? Ignoring her won't always work because like I stated before she will say things out loud about me and it is embarrassing. I've never been in a situation like this before.

Relationship's fine, he's fine, i'm fine, etc. 

At first their house smelt a little weird. Not the CLEANLIEST family, but it really didn't bother me. I noticed the baseboards in the bathroom gathering a pretty grand amount of dust. And something my mother always said was 'a house will smell if you don't dust it'. Then I noticed they pretty much never vacuum. I saw them vacuum once before they had some out of towners stay with them before a wedding they were going to. But other than that, the floor is HORRIBLE.

Then they leave their food around the kitchen. They clean the dishes on the weekends, but if they make a stir fry on monday.. that dish (usually FILLED with food) will sit on the counter until they have 'free time' to clean it on the weekend. 

My boyfriend has these bad habits too. Keeping bowls of cereal, food, drinks in his room for WEEKS until I take them down myself. He never really had it drilled into him as a child to clean up after himself.

But about 5 months ago, they decided to adopt these two huge fucking dogs. They never trained them.

They shit in my boyfriend's room, shit in the hallway, pissed in the kitchen, threw up in the bathroom. They've trashed the place. And his parents love these dogs too much to get angry when they shit around. Once their had this huge diarrhea explosion in the bathroom and they didn't know about it, so I had to go and tell the parents. They got FURIOUS and said 'they're just dogs! what do you expect!?' and went in to clean it up. I wound up sleeping over that day, went back into the bathroom, and the shit was still all over the floor. Not touched.

The problem is.. I fucking LOVE their family. They adore me, I adore them. They treat me so nice and are so open with me. But my nose cannot stand it anymore. I can't focus on anything but 'please do some of that laundry sitting on the floor' or 'please take that rank chili off of the counter and put it in the trash'...

I'm getting tears in my eyes right now typing this (emotions, not smell triggering tears, har har har...). I have a great sense of smell and I'm hit with this huge wiff of shit and rotting food every time I walk into their house and it varies from room to room.

Changing from going over to my house is pretty much out of the question because my parents are bitter, etc etc, different story for a different day.

I have no idea what to do. I've tried burning candles but that shit don't cover it up.

1354834720.0,10,self.Advice,14es5n,I need some parenting advice regarding 2 separate incidents with my 12 year old step-son (stealing and sex).,11,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14es5n/i_need_some_parenting_advice_regarding_2_separate/,"1: He was accused of stealing money from another kids bag at school. It was his word versus a witness but every piece of circumstantial evidence pointed to him having done it. He has already had numerous suspensions and was facing a possible expulsion if he was caught. After a serious father-son talk he eventually confessed to me after I promised I wouldn’t tell the school or mum (my partner). I then lied to the school to protect him but made it clear to him I was doing this as a one-time favour and I would not protect him like this again in future. I am the only person that knows for a fact he did it. How do I punish him when I am unable to explain to anybody else why he is being punished?

2: He has an 11 year old girlfriend and things are moving rather too quickly for my liking. Both myself and my partner have observed that the girl is rather sexual for her age (when they think they’re not being watched we’ve seen her dry humping him and initiate fondling etc). They go to school together and live close to each other so there is ZERO possibility of doing anything to keep them apart. I do not want to be one of those parents that forbids a child from seeing someone … however I also have zero intention of tending to the child of my 12/13 year old step-son. I’ve had numerous “birds and bees” talks with him and he admitted that French kissing and “doctor and nurse” style fondling is regular play with them. I have told him that if it gets to the sex stage he HAS to come and see me regarding a condom. What else can I do to educate him and hopefully prevent them from having sex at such a young age?


TL;DR: 

1: How to punish step-son for stealing when I am the only person that knows he did it?

2: How to educate 12 year old step-son who is probably very close to having sex?

She regularly sees a counselor and I make it very clear she can talk to me about anything. She doesn't. Except when she's drinking. She'll go through a box of wine in an evening, or a bottle of gin, or a case of beer. She  has only started drinking this heavily in the last few months.

She may do this for a week straight and then take a week off. She wakes up hungover and says, ""oh, i'll never do that again."" I've asked her to slow down but I can't force her to. I can't force her to get help for it if she doesn't want to. 

Here's the problem though. When she drinks she just goes on and on, rambling about anything and everything, usually all these bad things going on in her life. Things I've already heard about and comforted her about. And she's violent. A couple hours ago she just ripped a shirt I was wearing. Maybe once a week she gets like this where either she falls and hurts herself or I have to get physical myself to defend myself. 

I love her so much and when she's not drinking she's the best woman in the world. But it's the times she is I don't want to be in the same city as her.

1340877530.0,8,self.Advice,vqfw9,Just got told yesterday that I'm being laid off in 11 days. after working here for 8.5 years. Needing advice on a few things. Please help.,8,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vqfw9/just_got_told_yesterday_that_im_being_laid_off_in/,"I know this is nothing new and lots of people are getting laid off every day.  I'm hoping I can get some advice/help on what to do next.  This may be long

Some information:

 * I live in Louisiana (An At-Will state)
 * I have worked here since December 2003
 * My hotel is shutting down on July 8th for 2-3 years for renovations (there is a possibility the owners will say ""fuck it"" and close it this Sunday)
 * I was just notified yesterday

Other things to note

 * have worked 40 hours a week since week 2 of employment as a night auditor
 * have never called in to work, not even for being sick.  NEVER
 * Have only been significantly late twice outside of unforeseeable problems (i.e car problems)
 * have came in to work early and on off days **countless** times in 8.5 years
 * have worked though very tough times at hotel (working 12 hour shifts cause everyone but my manager and I had quit, during the Hurricane Katrina fallout, bad managers, etc....)
 * Car broke down in 2010, started riding to bike to work and still would be there on time.
 * Only taken approx. 2.5 weeks of vacation of which only 1 week was actually paid
 * I've only gotten $1.50 in raised in 8.5 years (minimum wage has gone up $2.10 since 2003)
 * the job has no benefits


So, let's get down to business with needing help:

1.) I am fairly sure my employers will not offer me a severance package.  They are very, very, VERY tight with spending money, despite the fact that they are owners of a company that probably makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  When it came to this hotel, they would do absolutely anything they could save money, even on things like forgoing on fixing essentials essential things of a hotel.  Because of this, I am assuming they will not offer me one.  So, given everything that I have listed above and the really short notice on being laid off, I am going to ask for one.  

Can anyone give advice on how I should present my request?  How I should word it?  Tips on convincing them I deserve a severance package?  How much should I ask for?  After some quick google searching, I find a formula  for the average package being ""1-4 weeks worth of pay for every year worked"". That comes out to $3000 for the ""1 week plan"". I would like to receive 2 weeks as this seems the average. This comes out to roughly $6000.  Due to my outstanding years of service (see above) and because I know this is a fucking drop in the bucket to them, I feel $7000-$7500 is appropriate.

**How can I not only negotiate a severance package, but one above the average?**


2.) Unemployment, food stamps, and other assistance.  When should I apply?  What all things should I look into?  How long does it take to apply?  If I'm planning on moving to another state soon temporarily (could be as early as July 10th or in a month or two) can I apply in my current state, then transfer it to the other state? Should I even bother applying until I move to the new state.

I am a single 31 year old male with no kids.  I have been working since I was 16 (technically 15).  This is my third job ever.  I haven't been without a job since the mid 90s.  I am clueless.

**How should I handle federal assistance**

1376942439.0,9,self.Advice,1koo2x,Applying for jobs on craigslist? Here's my advice,9,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1koo2x/applying_for_jobs_on_craigslist_heres_my_advice/,"This might be a little on the nose for many people but here's how I recently got a job off craigslist.... 

Recently, my Free Lance web design career has been taking a dump so I decided to get back on the job market. 

First stop.. craigslist.

At first, I began to apply to job interviews one by one.. reading the entire job description, and praying for a call. After several weeks, I had heard nothing back except for an email saying ""Please visit our website to apply"" which usually resulted in long boring digital applications that I never got a call form.

So I decided to dig deep into my marketing tools. As an individual on the job market, you have to treat yourself as a product (or service). You have GOT to market yourself to potential employers. 

So what I did, was create a ""template"" email addressed to ""To Whom It May Concern"", started off by saying something like ""Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this position"" (keeping it general). And began to list relevant skills I possessed for that field of work. Now, I was applying mostly to IT support positions, but I listed all skills in the IT field.. programming languages, web design skills, management skills. I topped it off with large font, colored but not flamboyant key words like ""professional, enthusiastic, etc.."" in my signature and attached my resume.

Then I ran through craigslist, and grabbed the emails off of every job posting that didn't raise any read flags with a quick scan of the title. BCC 'd them all so that they wouldn't notice the mass email (leaving the ""TO:"" field blank, and away they went. I probably applied to 30 jobs in the one hour of work.

Needless to say, the next morning.. I woke up around noon, and there were 5 emails asking to set up an interview. No automated responses, no redirection to online applications.

Key point - If you're going to market yourself over the internet, think of innovative ways to grab the customers (employers) attention.

p.s.  -I just accepted the job offer after the interview and start on Monday. I'm going to be making 50% more than my last job in a similar field+ benefits.

Unfortunately, all of the bottles are empty now and I really miss some rum-flavored syrup in my evening tea, so me and some of my friends decided to travel abroad to Český Těšín in Czech Republic to find and buy several bottles.

A question for the Redditors who might live there: is it easy to come by such a treat? Is it a rarity in the country of will I find it in any store? Any ideas which stores in Český Těšín might have it?

Okay now you all might want to get comfortable because it's story time and I'm sorry if this post is super long but you all need the back story.
 
 I first noticed her in the lunchroom my senior year in high school. I was people watching like always when her beauty caught my eye. So now every time I'd see her I'd just stare. She was just that captivating. Anyway I think due to my obvious ogling she caught on and returned eye contact. When our eyes met I put on the most flirtatious smile I could muster, which she reciprocated with her own smile. 

  This went on for the whole year reddit. We didn't speak a word to each other, but every time I'd see her in the halls or in the lunchroom it was like our eyes and smiles did all the talking.
  
  Fast forward to the last day of school my senior year; a buddy of mine has his yearbook out. I decided to look her up. Yeah I know I'm a total creep but I wanted to at least know her name. I find her in the sophomore section. Since she's stuck in high school for another two years I knew that was probably the last day I'd ever see her. 
  
  Now fast forward to after school on the last day. My senior class had been pulling some shenanigans which resulted in the seniors not being able to bring their cars and if they did they were not allowed to park on campus. I thought fuck that, so I had my mom pick me up in the student parking lot. Student traffic is always congested as hell but with all the shit going down with my senior class, it made traffic ten times worse. As I'm sitting in the passenger side waiting for traffic to move I was completely immersed in my day dream, but I shit you not reddit it was like some strange force subconsciously told me to look to my right and when I did my breath fucking caught because there I see her hand in hand with some dude but she's looking right at me with that same fucking smile and when she notices me turn, it was like her smile got bigger. I did a double take because holy shit it was like fate was saying ""here's your last shot talk to her before she's gone for good.""  
  
  And in that moment of her beaming that smile at me; I was too stunned by her unexpected presence that I just gaped at her for a few seconds and turned away to look at my mom. When I looked into the passenger side mirror she was looking back with an expression that looked confused and hurt. That last time I saw her was in June 2012. I know it's been a year.

Well I recently found her on facebook thanks to the whole people you may know tab, and I've been contemplating sending her a message. I know it's a long shot as she may not even remember me, but my questions are if I do decide to finally try and communicate:

What should I say in order to not come off as a creepy stalker?

Is it too late to try to get to know her?

Was all the non verbal communication just me deluding myself into seeing what I wanted to see?

I use to work for a call center making decent money, but lost my job because of my failures to communicate properly with my HR team when I had an anxiety attack and needed a leave of absence. I've seen a doctor and I'm on Cymbalta, an SNRI, and Serpquel XR. Over the past month, I've lost my job, my roommate (he has a medical condition and is currently being cared for by his parents.) and I can't afford to pay rent. My parents are helping me out, and I'm getting help, but I can do nothing but feel worse and worse every time someone sticks their neck out for me and helps me. I've been looking for a job, with no luck. I'm behind on my internet bill(dunno if I'll even be able to read the responses,) and I am starting to feel as if there is nothing more here for me. I know people justify suicide in all different ways as an escape or salvation.  But I only see it as a way to keep my parents and friends from being burdened any more than they already are. I owe my parents so much for everything they've done, and I can say all I want that suicide isn't the option, but with my track record of driving them further and further into debt to keep me alive, I can't bear it. 

I use to dream of going to San Francisco and the Academy of Arts university. But I've never gotten anywhere close to going. I then dreamed of working at Riot Games, helping with their concept art and design. Again, no where close. I feel as if anything I want to accomplish is just a pipe dream with the ends closing. 

I don't know what to do. I really don't.

Edit: I guess I should add this in here. My Dad is still in the military, USAF, 33+ years and proud, his next assignment is in Germany. (I'm currently in Colorado USA) My parents can't take me with them, it's not an option we have financially. Nor should they be responsible for me like that.

Let me preface this by saying that my youngest kid was born with a cleft lip and palate.  He has had several surgeries and at 4.5 years old, is doing pretty well.

So the Lone Ranger movie by Disney had a villain.  The makeup folks decided that they would give him a cleft lip scar to make him more sinister.  What a birth abnormality has to do with that, I have no idea.  Whatever.

But then LEGO puts out a set with this character ""whose terribly scarred face is a perfect reflection of the bottomless pit that passes for his soul.""  That is from their site.  Really?

I sent them an email containing this paragraph:

""I am not as worried about how my son (or the thousands of other children that are born with this defect each year) will see this, but rather how his friends are going to see it.  How in the world can your company put something like this out to children who are already more prone to make fun of differences and expect it to not have some sort of negative effect?  Tell me this:  Whenever kids are playing Lone Ranger, and some kid who has a cleft is on the playground, who is going to be the 'bad guy'?  Who is going to be chased by all of the kids who want to be the 'hero'?  I know that you didn't create the character, but you certainly had the power to not represent a condition that (through no fault of their own) kids are going to have to deal with for a lifetime. You had the power not to perpetuate a completely false negative stereotype.  You had the power to make a positive decision and statement.  Unfortunately, you did not have the good judgement.""

After I got a form letter back from them, part of my last response (to which they have not responded) says:

""Many of these children are tube fed as infants because they cannot form suctions.  Then they spend the first years of their lives trying to learn to eat correctly, getting cosmetic surgeries, and having the inside of their mouths reconstructed so that they can speak correctly.  Then in the years that follow there are continuous sessions of speech therapy, orthodontic surgeries to rebuild their gums, years of straightening out their teeth, and more surgeries as their bodies mature.

And then of course, they have little things like dealing with their classmates making them the bad guy... you know... like the movies and toys tell encourage.  But that isn't really a big deal, is it?""

**About me** I am a 17 year old male, about to be a senior in high school next year. I am a very smart person (take my word for it on account of the story please). I generally consider myself to be a very good person, helping others and giving to the needy.

**So I will cut straight to the chase...** I worked retail and stole money from the store I worked at and was caught resulting in my employment being terminated (which I'm guessing goes unsaid).

**My Very Poor Excuse** I am in no way trying to justify my actions, just trying to identify a root of the problem. I am a religious person and would never even think about stealing until recent events. But in the past year my parents got divorced and this has created tensions in the whole family I have a hard time dealing with. Most importantly my parents complain about money, so I think in my subconscious I decided money was the ultimatum and that I had to have it. This drove my greed and illicit tendencies.

**Details Of How I Did It** This in depth explanation is obviously not a good plan considering I was caught so don't try it... Anyway what I did was known as a fraudulent return. I worked the cash register and would take receipts people left behind and return the item taking either cash or tendering it to my credit card. I amassed around $400 in a month before loss prevention caught on.

**Consequences** I won't go in depth to describe the accusations and my admittance to them but I can assure you it was probably the most embarrassing moment of my life. From what i can remember they said if I paid everything back they wouldn't take legal action. (Thank God) And they would not notify my parents but I told my mother anyway to get it off my chest.

**The Advice I Desperately Need** What I want to do mostly is save face and not let anyone find out what I did who doesn't have to. If any of my friends/teachers/family/coaches/girlfriend :( found out I would be embarrassed beyond recovery and I just don't know what I would do. And before you say thats what I deserve... I know it is, I just couldn't bear it. :(

So some ideas I had would be to send in a letter of apology asking for the confidence of my managers, who are very decent people.

I have gotten help for it as an adolescent, he has not -- wants me to ""pay"" for it now as an adult. It's tearing my life apart.",8,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1grau8/i_am_a_34_year_old_survivor_of_child_sexual_abuse/,"...it is all coming out as adults in a very painful way.

When I was about 4-5 years old, I was molested by my grandfather. I did not remember anything about it until I was 19 years old when he tried to do it again. I started realizing that he is the source of my childhood abuse and learned around that time that he had also molested his own daughter, my mother, including raping her into her teens. Most recently, in the last 2 years, I have been remembering more details of my abuse and have been wanting to get to the bottom of it. One thing I have always remembered was the child on child sexual abuse from neighborhood kids. It was out on control. All of the children in my neighborhood, including myself of course, were very secretive about it. It ended at about age 9.

When I was about 14, I ran away from home and wanted to no part of being around my family. Mind you, my brother and I were very close. He is 5 years younger than me. I always thought I may have done something to him and never wanted to think about it again but I just could not stand it anymore and decided to run away from home.

I ended up on the streets for several months, using drugs and drinking and at age 15, I stole a gun from a friends father. In a fight I got into at a bus station, and out of fear, I fired the gun and a man came to take me away where I ended up in a mental ward getting a psyche evaluation (which I had no diagnoses other than I have issues I need addressed but I have no mental psychosis to speak of) and later put in juvenile detention.

I was supposed to spend 2 years in a juvenile detention facility and ended up only staying for 13 months for good behavior and successfully completing my treatment program. During my treatment in juvi, I addressed the child on child sexual abuse with my counselors and therapists. I felt this helped me tremendously and I came out a much better person. I never abused anyone after age 9 and got my life on track. I truly felt like I got over it then.

Fast forward to age 19. I was picked up by my grandfather one day while waiting at a bus stop to attend a job interview. My grandfather pulled me closer to him in his old car (which had a bench seat in the front) and began rubbing his hand close to my pubic area under my dress, asking me ""are you sure you have to go to your job interview?..."" and in the end of the car ride, soliciting me for sex with a $5 bill, telling me ""you're worth it."" I jumped out of the car and vowed to never speak to him again.

This brought on instant memories of my childhood with him.

I tried to have the incident reported and a member of my family threatened my life if I said another peep about it. So I shut my mouth. (Grandfather is dead now by the way, as of last year).

Remembering more of my childhood through out the next few years, I talked to my brother about the abuse. I told him that I may have done something to him as a child that I cannot remember exactly what, but I feel I may have done something and that I wanted him to know that I am sorry if I did. He said that he doesn't remember and that it was OK. He then began telling me that he did something to ME in my sleep just a year or so prior while I was passed out drunk in my apartment. He began to give me details but I told him that I don't want to hear it. That we need to just close the door on this now and put it all behind us.

We moved on with our lives and went back to being close siblings.

Over the next decade up until now, my brother has had some issues with gender identity and wanted to transition into a woman, and I was very supportive of him. Though he wanted this transformation, he also didn't want it at the same time. I explained to him that if he was that confused, he should get help; therapy. I myself was in therapy for a past abusive relationship where I was diagnosed with PTSD over, as well as the abuse I endured from my childhood. He declined going into therapy with me but we remained close up until about a month ago.

Now that we are adults, it is coming out in the worst way and I am being accused of being a pedophile, a monster and a ""piece of shit"" for what I did as a child.

I now have 2 children, a boy and a girl, I am in a great relationship with someone who knows every detail of my past and has helped me through a lot in the last few years. My fiancee and I were invited to park our RV in front of my brother and his girlfriends home during the winter where we ended up moving in to their home for the rest of the winter to save money and until we can get onto our feet. During our stay, my brothers girlfriend was extremely passive aggressive toward us (that is a TL;DR story for certain) and we finally moved out last month. She wouldn't return our belongings, started trying to turn my family against each other and all around, is just not a nice person -- she is one nasty woman and we came to our own conclusion that this person is a sociopath. (can ask me in comments for details on why she is a sociopath and I will answer).

Upon warning a mutual friend about this sociopath, she forwarded the email to my brother and he began raising hell, threatening to ""tell a secret"" that will ""ruin my life forever"" for trying to turn their friends against them; which I was only explaining to her that I am worried for my brother being with this sociopath. Claiming that I molested him, which I nor him do not recall. Through out emailing each other 2 days ago, and further admitting exactly what I said to him years prior that I may have done something to him as a child, when I was a child, he said to me ""so you DID do something, I knew it, you sick piece of shit pedophile. I am going to have a nice conversation with your kids dad and tell them everything and how you molest little kids and that you don't deserve to be around children period. You deserve to be in prison and I am going to make sure you never see your kids again and you go to prison for what you did to me."" Then further claiming, himself, that he doesn't even remember what happened.

My mom is in hell about this right now, she has health problems and this is making it worse for her to hear, as the sociopath girlfriend, whom I should mention has a masters degree is psychology but never made it as a psychiatrist and is now taking up law (that's what sociopaths do), she will not stop texting my mother about this, saying that she always takes sides with me (which she does not, my mother loves both of her kids equally).

This sociopath woman is also 15 years older than my 29 year old brother, whom has been with him for 4 years.

We'll just refer to this woman as a sociopath from here on out: So the sociopath is now relentlessly telling my mother that I belong in prison for being a sex offender and that I am a sociopath because of the child abuse and that everyone should listen to her since she has a masters degree in psychology. She's also a master at displaying an extreme amount of anxiety and cannot function under the slightest amount of stress but can sit there and feed my brothers fire with sociopathic gasoline by way of trying to get my mother to take sides with them about me being this monster; trying to get my mother to hate me or something, as well as try to have a conviction on me as an adult for something that I already got help for as an adolescent.

I feel that the person here who needs the help is my brother, first and foremost by getting away from the sociopath and then getting himself some help for whatever he endured as a child. It clearly has not gone away yet and I am not sure of what to do. My kids are about to be home from their summer vacation and I really just want to move on with my life and put this in the past, like I have done already. I feel like I can't do that until my brother gets himself the help he needs and in fact, I often feel like my brother may even come after me, by way of coercion from the sociopath, and kill me or something.

I don't know what to do, other than just go away and never look back on my brother again. He is also trying to convince me that I will be facing criminal charges because he will be filing a report to the police. Which I feel they will just tell him that he needs to get therapy because that was 25 years ago and we were children.

Can you be convicted of something as an adult for something that happened as a child? I mean, I already went to juvenile hall for 13 months and got help for my life spiraling out of control. I think that was enough -- for me anyway. I have never hurt anyone after the child on child abuse incidents. It did not carry into my teens or adulthood and I surely do not hurt my children.

I am no monster. And if I was a sociopath, I surely would have never tried to kill myself later in life (which I have) from severe depression nor would I have ever sought help for myself being in severe mental and emotional pain, trying to get to the bottom of my issues.

The real person here who needs help now, I feel, is my brother. Am I alone in this?

Then we were getting intimate about 2 weeks later, and she only pulled out 2 (there were all attached). Yesterday I saw she had a message on facebook. I went to answer it, and it was a guy sending a rather indecent and profound message. I went through the conversation to find that she had been having these kind of conversations on more than one occasion. So I confronted her about it and asked if there had been any other guys and she said no. It was obvious she was lying and I called her out on it. After she admitted to it I decided that everyone deserves a second chance and if I fucked up like that, I'd want one too. Well about a week ago, she was going to get high ""for the last time"" and that would be it. I told her if I caught her doing it again, I'd leave her. Today I was at her house, but I was still suspicious about guys. I opened her iPod and went through her emails and saw a few from facebook. She and her ex boyfriend were sneaking out and meeting up at night. He messaged me to try to piss me off and said that they had been sneaking out and having sex for the past two weeks. I thought he was lying until now. So deciding to think about it before acting, I went home. I decided to call her and she didn't answer. So I went back to her house only to find her smoking weed in her shed with 2 other friends. I got whatever I had out of her house and threw it into my car. I decided it'd be a good time to confront her about it and she still denied it until I told her I already knew, then she confessed again. I left her and she admitted to having sex with her ex.

Sometimes it hard to keep it together.,7,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1coe89/im_unemployed_and_have_no_friends_or_money/,"Being unemployed means most of my days all sort of mash together into a blur.  I don't have a lot of money to get out and do anything, and the weather here's been crap.  It's April 19th and we just got more snow outside.  I was hoping by now I would at least be able to take my bike out and get some exercise.

I don't have any friends nearby.  I have some high school friends back in my home town a few hours away and a good friend who lives about 600 miles away.  I can't afford to visit as all my money goes into bills and food.  I have little money to spend on myself otherwise.  I have a lot of things I would like to be doing, but just can't afford.

I stay inside most days and find it extremely easy to just cut all ties with everyone with excuses or by not talking to them and just hide inside and be a vegetable.  Yesterday I spent most of my day on the couch in a blanket watching Adventure Time.  

There aren't any jobs in my area that would be related to what I went to college for, and I feel if I don't get a decent job i'll be a failure.  I feel like a loser not working, but I'd feel a thousand times worse if I put myself in a minimum wage job in a completely different field.  I've been looking into moving to find work in another town and have had some phone interviews but haven't landed anything yet.  I've been without a job for almost six months now and I am just drained of motivation or hope that things will get better.

I am not sure what kind of advice I am hoping to get, but I feel I am trapped here and I just want to get out of it.  I want to have someone give me a job where I can go work and make friends and come home and bring in a paycheck and actually start a life.  I have a crushing amount of debt and student loans that I can't afford.  

Why is it so hard to just start a life and work and raise a family and have a decent car?  I can't do anything with my life.  I see other people my age that have it all together and are getting by just fine.  I see people younger than me getting by just fine.  Why can't I?  I'm not ugly and I don't have any disabilities and i'm a good person.  I am a great employee and very loyal and professional.  But I can't find a job.

The worst part is having to answer to my fiancee who luckily loves me and is still with me.  To have to explain to her every day that I didn't find a job and I didn't make any money and that I stayed inside all day doing nothing again - that hurts the worst.  She deserves someone who can provide for her.  I hate the feeling of staying home all day while she goes to work.  What a loser thing for a man to do.

I hope you can give me some advice on this.
For the last few years, I was very close to this girl (let's call her Sarah) and we became the best friends. People find her annoying at times, but I just love everything about her.

Then she told me she liked, loved me. I didn't know what to do, so I said yes, then I rejected her straight after. I lied to my friends and told them I couldn't possibly date her because she was annoying and fat and such.

I shouldn't have done that, but I did, because I'm gay and I am not ready to come out, not for another 10 years, since a lot of people around me are homophobic.

My intention was to not hurt her by rejecting her, thinking that it would be worse if she found out later. But in reality, I hurt her so much, that she didn't talk to me for the next 6 months or so, and it pains me to think about her, and I think about her so much. Every time I see her, I feel guilt, shame and sadness. I would really not mind if she would hurt me or even kill me.

I finally feel like my life is going in the right direction and built up the courage to talk to her. We've been less awkward recently and it makes me very happy. She's right in my friend group and I'd love for her to be in my life for a long time.

Reddit, how should I go about talking to her and explaining myself? How do I do it so that she understands my situation? How do I do it so that she doesn't hate me?

She has had some blood in her urine off and on since before thanksgiving 2012. Her regular doctor prescribed antibiotics on two occasions. The blood went away for a while each time and then came back. 
 
Apparently, it has gotten to the point that she is urinating what appears to be pure blood (though it clears up somewhat at times). She had an appointment with a urologist last week. 
 
My grandmother has one atrophied kidney and had an extended episode of renal failure 6 years ago (just some background). 
 
I kind of expected them to do an ultrasound or scope or something to attempt to either find a kidney stone or tumor or something like that. Instead, they took a vial of blood and a urine sample (which my grandmother said was very bloody). 
 
They said they want her to have a CAT scan, but they have to get it approved by insurance first. They've scheduled her to go back the first week of April. That's almost a month away and she's already had this issue for 6 months. 
 
Is that a normal protocol for dealing with what appears to be a very immediate and pressing issue? 
 
My other grandmother had a similar issue. She had some blood in her urine and was feeling fatigued. She went to the hospital in a different city, was admitted, had an ultrasound and scope done... determined she didn't have cancer, had a UTI and a kidney stone, and has an appointment go get the stone lasered next week. All of that was within 4 days while my other grandmother is peeing blood for a month until she goes back to the doctor.
 
If it did turn out to be cancer, isn't early detection sort of important? This could have been cleared up last year. 
 
What can I do? Who can I call? What questions do I need to ask? She'll consent to me doing whatever, I just don't know what to do. I'm 29 and I have power of attorney, if that matters.

1363097631.0,8,self.Advice,1a5boc,About to marry into a dysfunctional family. Advice?,8,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1a5boc/about_to_marry_into_a_dysfunctional_family_advice/,"I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible, but there's a lot of background, so bear with me:

My fiancee's (I will refer to her as A) brother-in-law (B) is a colossal douchebag.  He's arrogant, selfish, and is the dictator in his marriage to A's sister.  He has never liked A's father because they both have giant egos and it is a clash of the ego titans.  A's mother and father have a VERY similar marriage to that of B.  The husband is very controlling and the wife will never stand her ground.  B comes from a preacher's family, so he thinks he knows what is best for a family and never fails to spout off his bullshit.  


About a year ago, B's family got a new addition.  As a new father, his dictatorship has grown stronger.  At Christmas last year, he was holding on to the baby's hands and swinging her around all over the place, which made a lot of us nervous.  I calmly said ""B, that's a pretty dangerous thing to do to an infant""  He snapped.  ""Don't tell me what's best for my child, you have no experience in the matter.""  Which is sort of true, I have a lot of experience with toddlers and older, but not infants and I wasn't going to pick any fights on Christmas.

Very recently, A's parents announced that they are getting a divorce.  A and myself were actually very excited about this, because you could tell they were both extremely unhappy with their current situation.  When A's father tried to pull A's sister aside to give her the news, B told him that he could not talk to her without him being there.  A's father (not in an aggressive tone) asked him to please leave as this was something he wanted to tell her in private.  B flew off the hook, exclaiming that she will never talk to him without him being there.  Then there was an ego supernova.  A's father called B arrogant, and B grabbed his wife by the arm, yanked his daughter right out of A's mothers arms, and stormed out.  

A's sister still had no idea what the news even was.  She found out later via text message.  A day goes by and we all figured the situation had defused itself.  One evening, A's mother calls A and tells her what happened next.  B tore ass up the driveway, damn near kicked the door down, and stormed upstairs where A's father was watching tv.  He started ripping into him about being a terrible father, a terrible husband, and ungodly (hypocrite, much?).  He told him that he will never see or speak to his daughter or granddaughter again, and left.  He changed A's sister's phone number, and gave it out to the rest of us, saying ""don't give it to A's father"".  When I inquired about it, he said they changed it because people from A's sister's old job were calling 30+ times a day, which I know is bullshit.

B sent a text to me and A that said ""I just wanted to let you know that my wife and I are not speaking to [A's father].  Thought you should know before the shit hits the fan""

That's the backstory.  Here's where we stand currently:

I did something that I usually do not do and I got involved, trying to be the voice of reason.  I called him up and asked what the deal was and asked him what it would take to work this out.  He was like a brick wall.  He told me he'll never let A's dad speak to the daughter and granddaughter ""until he changed"".  I asked what he would consider to be ""changed"".  He said that if A's father put forward a solid effort to be involved in B's wife and daughter's lives, then he may reconsider (but you can see that he's removed any avenue of contact, so I'm not sure how he's supposed to do that).  I've never considered A's father a particularly good father or husband, but I paid the amount of respect to him that I felt was appropriate.  I always chalked it up to be unhappy with his lot in life.  And so I told him about the story of my parents, who had a very similar relationship until their divorce, at which point everyone became happier.  My family still spends holidays together, dad and mom in the same room, laughing and talking about days past.  He outright told me that I will never have a model for a healthy marriage and that his parents have been together for x-whatever years (remember, this is a preacher's kid).  

B is now claiming (only to me) that A's father was abusive and performed ""traumatic acts"" against A's sister, which I know is bullshit. Not sure if I should tell everyone what he is claiming.

A's sister won't respond to text messages, except for one message thread she sent to A that basically said ""I don't want to talk about it"". and they will not share any news with the rest of the family (she's looking for a job and a new car, but we get no updates on how that is going).  A's sister is set to be the matron of honor at our wedding, but I honestly don't want B to be there, and telling him that I don't endangers A's sister status as Matron of Honor (he WILL try to stop her).  If A's mom babysits for them, B requires her to leave if A's father comes home, and call him immediately so that he can come pick her up.  Any time A's mom wants to spend time with A's sister, B tags along (to monitor conversation, I'm sure).  He won't let A's sister have a 1 year birthday for their daughter because he knows she will want to invite the family.  

The whole situation is fucked and, in reality, I think he needs a good old-fashioned ass-whooping to knowck his ego down a few levels, but I've remained civil this whole time, and I'm not going to break that now.  I have no idea where to go from here.  He'll continue to think he knows best and will maintain a stranglehold on his marriage and keep his wife and daughter from the rest of us if no one does anything.  But what can be done?  Any effort seems futile to me.  It's been about 2 weeks since I talked to B about it, and I don't know if I want to bring it up again, or even how to do that.  It's breaking my future mother-in-law's heart, because she's effectively lost her daughter and granddaughter in one swift moment, and her being in turmoil over it infuriates me at B's selfishness and arrogance.

Ages (so you can get an idea of what stage in life we're all at, if it matters):  A &amp; me are 26; B is 29, A's sister is 28, A's mother is 60, A's father is late fifties.  B is a bit old to be acting so juvenile, in my opinion.

Finally got to art school, signed my name onto $80k worth of private loans, but repeating in my mind what my admissions advisor said to me: “You are guarenteed a job!” I was an 18 year old kid with no concept of money: no one in my family went to college, parents didn’t want me to get a “useless” art degree anyway, blah blah blah I know I’m a fucking idiot for signing my name on that line but its in the past and I can’t change it. 
Couldn’t afford to not have a full-time job to pay for rent, food, gas, very little else. Lived off of ramen and got pretty ill after a while because of it, funny story related to this tidbit I will tell at a later time. 
Due to working a 35-40 hour a week job as well as school full time, my homework suffered a little. I could have been much worse with it, but because of my dedication I always received A+ grades, I just knew in my heart that I could have definitely done a lot better if I only had more time to try. One example of this is when I started to learn 3d: the place I worked was shutting down and so I spent more freetime than I wanted on finding something else, including going to my career services and asking for an internship but being denied because… nope, I don’t have any idea. I think the woman there just didn’t like me, I know it sounds like a bullshit excuse but I have no idea why a persistant, capable student was denied an internship. Maybe I just came off as a shithead and she didn’t want to waste anyone’s time, who knows. Anyway, I was better than most of my peers at 3d, but I definitely wasn’t the best, unlike my 2d skills where I was easily the best if not one of the best in all of my classes. (Not bragging or trying to sound confident here, there were/are a lot of people who go to “Video Game School” who have never drawn in their life, and since I started at 14 I had a bit of a head start)

I got better and better, and to date I’d say I’m a good artist (not great, excellent, amazing, etc.) and with fresh degree in hand, I landed an interview. It actually went amazingly well, but I did not get the job. I think I failed the art test because it was in 3d and not 2d where I am most strong, and there must have simply been a stronger candidate. Had to move home due to lack of funding (quit my job the last four months of school to focus on portfolio work) and back in with my mom in Indiana. 
Depression set in halfway through my BFA, and I hesitated to type this because I can still hear my mother saying “Depression isn’t a real illness” in the back of my mind, but it’s definitely real and it’s so, so awful. My relationships were strained, and luckily that was the only thing that suffered while in college, but after I got out and failed at getting the job I had worked so hard for, it took away everything. Because of strained relationships in college, I have limited contacts. In this industry I have heard a million times that it’s not about how good you are, but who you know. Fucked myself over pretty big I guess. 
I finally got a job doing something administrative, just to pay the bills. Sallie Mae calls and informs me of my impending $1100/month student loan payments. My job at the time paid around minimum wage, I made about $1000 a month. Keep applying, but notice that drawing becomes more and more difficult. 
Some life drama happens including all friends from college dropping off the face of the earth, my 14 year old dog died, a sinus infection with no health insurance, bf becomes distant, some other things too etc.
 Stop drawing altogether. 

2009: Move to Oregon with $1000 in my pocket, get an admin job, start drawing again. Risky, but I moved to be closer to more relevant jobs!
Admin job is at a call center, “hostile work environment”, too exhausted to work at night, but am able to create some things. 
Had my boyfriend of ten years fuck me over, long story short: I was working to support the both of us while he found a job in his industry of study, he was supposed to do the same for me. Once he landed a job (after 2.5 years of virtual unemployment) I quit my job to take a risky position as an artist at a start-up company. He couldn’t support us because he was shitty with money, we end up breaking up after he tells me he hasn’t loved me for years anyway. The start-up company tells me not to come back via email due to lack of work on their end. Extreme depression. Crawl back to my call center job after a month of desperately seeking employment. 
Start to feel myself again slowly but surely. An internet guy I was extremely close to in college (but the ex hated that I talked to) comes back into my life. He tells me he believes in me, and gets me to believe again, too. I start creating more. Internet guy visits and eventually moves here to upgrade into boyfriend status. We are finally happy! 
With something in my life going correctly, I start becoming more and more productive. Do some 3d freelance on the side, it exhausts me working so much, and 3d is infinitely frustrating since I’m not great at it, but I feel I am finally using my degree! One of my clients is a small company that sells ideas to Adidas. Most of my projects involve Adidas things, so when I later saw Adidas hiring an on-site, 3d Artist, I put together my portfolio and applied. Denial email less than 24 hours later. Accept that I must be just “passable” at 3d and definitely not “good” but I should simply work harder if I want to be employed doing it. Fighting off feeling really down about this acceptance. 

Stop doing freelance after this setback, but started doing projects that involve 2d things I enjoy more. 
Left crappy, emotionally manipulative call center job for a much more relaxing, higher paying job. Take on crazy projects. 
Currently: 
- indie game project where I am the only artist, it’s slow and challenging work but I am learning so much and will be delighted to complete! 
-illustrating a children’s book 
-getting ready to release my webcomic

Find out last month that my new job is not going to hire me on full time as I intially thought, and instead they’re letting me go in July all due to budget constraints. Was planning on relocating to Seattle due to less saturation in creative industries there. Overall more job opportunities, too. Not enough funds to move. 
Start looking for some kind of art job that I can apply to right now, something that I could definitely get hired for. Doing something creative, ANYTHING would make me feel less depressed and useless. Find nothing. 
Start looking for admin jobs. Nothing except considerable paycuts and more stress. Depression creeping back in.

What the fuck do I do with my stupid life? 

I'm sick of working administrative jobs where, it's childish to say, but I'm kind of always disrespected because it's a peon job or whatever. I am capable of working very hard and I accept that I must not be at a hirable skill level, but deciding what path to take is apparently my downfall. I can’t get hired because I lack experience, and I’m working for free on all these other projects hoping they will make me look good to employers, but I’m not sure if it will work. 
There seem to be more 3d jobs avaiable in general, in cities that I wouldn’t mind living, but I need to practice a hell of a lot more. I wouldn’t mind dropping everything and dedicating all of my free time into getting better at 3d, but if I stop doing 2d only to have all of my hard work not pay off again… I’m not sure if I could handle the disappointment. I love doing 2d, I’m best at it, but I’m finding a 9-5 decent paying (ie: not poverty level) job does not exist. I can do other things, I can use many different programs, but it seems like all of the jobs I’m seeing that are hiring require some other skill that I can’t even lie about having (ie: ability to code or program) I’m not sure we live in an economy that can support artists, or maybe I just haven’t worked hard enough. 
PS: I typed in a lot of incomplete sentences and I’m very sorry if it’s painful to read because of this, I was just trying to get it all out as quickly as possible. 


Tl;dr: I am a useless, talentless hack who cannot get a job. If anyone has any specific advice I would be greatly thankful.

My sister(a) is stealing money. This is an ongoing thing. Approximately a year ago, we discovered that she had stolen approximately $300. At the time, my other sister(b) and I had a discussion with my father and he at least pretended to be outraged. Unfortunately, nothing ever came of it. No punishments, maybe a stern talking-to. This past weekend, my other sister(b) discovered that she(a) had stolen $80. My father allegedly talked to (a) once again, but (b) reports that he was willing to give his debit card to (a) only a day later to get eggs from the store. 

These are only the times that we know that she has stolen large amounts of money. She has the access to my father's debit card and we could have missed other instances or she could simply being stealing smaller amounts that we are unable to catch.

I truly believe that she doesn't feel guilt. She is incredibly manipulative and I don't think she cares about us or the consequences. 

I plan to talk to him again tonight, but I'm not sure what I could say to get through to him. If we don't put a stop to this, I don't know what we're going to do. Money is already pretty tight without having to worry about missing another $100.

- Inability to commit.

    Examples: relationships ended for no real reason, difficulty in planning events or holidays, or in buying a car, a flat

    Effects: Things do not happen

    Causes: 1) Fear of missing out on other options
                 2) Fear of getting stuck in problematic situations (If I buy a car I'll have to take care of it, if I buy a flat I won't be able to quit my job...)


- Inability to work and get things done

    Examples: days spent sitting at work doing nothing, almost none of my projects ever get finished...

    Effects: Things do not happen. My job is at risk

    Causes: 1) Being lazy
                 2) Lack of energy
                 3) Lack of focus
                 4) Lack of involvement
                 5) Desire for immediate pleasure

- Destructive or unwanted thoughts

    Examples: fantasies of being dead or never waking up from my sleep or intrusive images of me firing a gun to my head (at least twice a day), images of incestual acts

    Effects: self-disgust, anger towards self, lower energy and motivation, self-pity (which causes more self-disgust)

    Causes: 1) above 2 problems leading to low self-esteem
                 2) strong tendency to give up in general (be it on projects, goals, people, etc.)
                 3) despair


EDIT: Thanks everyone for your answers, it's nice to see that some people care. I'll try and implement your suggestions, the most common one being to go see a professional. I wish you all a nice day and life.

The gentleman in charge has gone back on several of the statements in very sudden ways. ""I didn't promise to pay for..."" ""I never said that"" I called him a liar and he threatened to throw me out of his home.  He told me to go, actually, but then cooled when he realized I had nothing and nowhere in the city to go to.

She's a good roommate and a very sweet girl. Hell, she makes me dinner sometimes. It's going so well so far that I really don't want to fuck it up, because in this city just finding housing is next to impossible, much less finding nice housing with a sane and friendly roommate.

Anyway, the one huge issue I am having is how she treats her dog. She bought this little mixed poodle off craigslist when I moved in. I was happy to have a dog in the apartment, so that was all well and good. But she refused to get her spayed. Well, I figured that was none of my business and to stay out of it, put my blinders on and not say anything. But now she's seriously talking about having puppies. She even asked me for advice and facts about breeding, because my parents are professional breeders. I admit I'm really awful at confrontation and was caught offguard, so I just confirmed that it takes about 9 weeks for dog pregnancy and side-stepped the conversation. Fuck, she even said she has a friend with a dog that offered to act as stud.

Important note: Our apartment complex has no real pet policy other than weight - an immense rarity in this area. Hence, why she could get away with it.

I am really horrifed about the idea. We have a tiny apartment and no room for puppies. I find breeding like this irresponsible and morally repugnant, because the pups will only end up in the pound and my heart couldn't take that. My roommate is very laissez faire with her dog, keeping her locked in her dark bathroom while she's at work because she's not fully house trained. There's no way she could handle the work and effort that is involved with breeding. It's really stressing me out and I can't handle the thought of this poor little tiny dog being put through a dangerous pregnancy with someone who has no idea what she's doing for puppies that will most likely end up being put down. It's giving me terrible anxiety right now.

I know the right thing to do is just put my foot down and say no, not while I'm living here. But I just don't know how to without sounding patronizing or like a bitch.

She won't abort, but she doesn't expect anything from me monetarily or otherwise. 

I am not sure exactly what my responsibilities are towards her or the kid, he made the decision without me, while the decision not to use the condom that one time was mutual. She mentioned she really, really, really wanted a kid so when she found out she was pregnant, after thinking on it for a month, decided there was no better time than now since it was already here. 

I'm worried to take her words at face value. Should I lawyer up even if we decide I should be in his/her life? I'm only in the country for a year or so, after which I'll have to return to my country, so I have no option at the moment to be a permanent parental figure. I'm worried that there is a possibility she could use this against me (my gut says she isn't going to do that as she didn't tell her family who I was, only that she was pregnant and wanted their support). 

Obviously I have a responsibility towards the child, but she has said she has no problem taking it on herself and with her family and she has already began making preparations or just that. It seems I can totally walk free, but it feels wrong on every level, however, it would be better for her and the child if she remarried someone her age with a job. In that case I would be expected to stay out of it. 

This is just too real. Any advice or suggestions would be grateful. 

I know these posts are common. Sorry. 

Edit: I don't even know her age. I'm mid 20's and would guess she is around 40. I don't want kids, at least not until I'm her age.

My wife and I have a five month old french bulldog. Quite possibly the cutest and most wonderful animal known to mankind. He's friendly, lovable, smart, kind, and cute. We've had him for about three months now, and he's been amazing. Learned tons of tricks, is totally house broken, interacts well with other people and dogs. Just an amazing animal on pretty much every level.
Three days ago, my wife was holding our dog, Hubert, in the common area of our apartment. She noticed another tenant had a dog trainer with him, and was having his dog learn how to go down the stairs. Hubert is still too little to go down stairs, so she was just holding and watching. The dog trainer noticed her standing there, and she made a passing comment about how Hubert still can't go down stairs. Before she knew what happened, he had grabbed Hubert from her hands, said ""I'll help him"" and attached his leash to Hubert's collar. My wife very reluctantly agreed - he had a very aggressive, bullyish attitude. He just did it. Within about three seconds, he was YANKING Hubert down the stairs. Of course, he tumbled several steps almost immediately. My wife ran down and grabbed him, only to be BERATED by this trainer for ""coddling"" the dog. He proceeded to verbally abuse her in front of several neighbors for ""coddling"" him by picking him up. It was really upsetting. Naturally, my wife went back inside and was pretty shaken up. She was texting/emailing me just saying how aggressive and mean he had been. He even yelled at her in front of other tenants, calling her a bad pet owner for using a retractable leash, and saying she was doing a disservice to the dog.
I can't tell you how wrong that guy is - my wife is the most loving person in the world, and anyone who knows our dog knows he's incredible.
ANYwho, we then notice later on that every time Hubert runs, it's with a very definite limp in his back leg. It's obvious. So I take him to the vet. Sure enough, he chipped a bone in his back leg. The vet says it's consistent with tumbling down the stairs. So, this little dude can't get a cast because of the positioning of the chip - meaning that we literally have to sedate him for the next three weeks and not allow him to do ANYTHING. It's freaking heartbreaking. This cute little ball of energy and love isn't allowed to run, jump, stand, chew, play, or anything - and he doesn't understand why.
So, of course, I call this dog trainer to explain the situation. This guy is AGGRESSIVE. Yelling at me, calling my wife a liar, all this stuff. Eventually, by being really mellow and calm, I get him to agree to call our vet. He then proceeds to hang up on several different people from the vet's office, curses them, calls them dishonest, and calls my wife and I dishonest. He texts me, again berating us for using a retractable leash, and for ""holding"" the dog, which apparently, is coddling. HOWEVER - in the midst of all of this - he did end up paying a $250 vet bill. I'm sure there will be more costs, and I'm also pretty sure he won't be ponying up for any more.
So my question is - do I take to yelp with this guy? I have an elite account, and many friends - and I'm sure his business would be hurt. I just can't decide, since he SORT OF did the right thing by paying for the vet bills. But, it's killing me to think that someone else may have to go through this. I can't imagine another innocent animal being totally abused by this guy, simply because I DIDN'T speak up online. At the same time - this guy seems like he has the propensity to be an extra-dick, and take things way too far. I see him as someone willing to get personal, and I'm not sure if I'm up for that fight.

Three moths ago, my husband started school full time. We were struggling with the distance of his school from our home, especially considering I had to work immediately after he got home. The cost of gas and the time of travel was wearing on us, so I called my grandmother and asked if we could move into one of her two spare bedrooms until we could find a rental closer to his school. The next morning I got a call from my mother (who resides at another property owned by my grandmother) saying that she was told to move out so I could move in. My mother was being irrational stating she had to move into a homeless shelter (she is employed full time as a nurse) and that my two siblings were to go live with friends. Lots of arguments were to follow. We argued over where to place blame, where to live, everything. It culminated in my mother telling me that I was so fucked up someone should study me. We didn't speak for a month. Then all of a sudden, my mother calls me apologizing, telling me to now move in with her. At that point I had nowhere to go, so I begrudgingly moved from my 900+ square foot apartment into a 126 square foot room. Mind you, my husband, daughter and I are living in one room. Shortly after moving in, my two teenage siblings began to verbally harass me and try to guilt trip me to the point where I no longer felt comfortable leaving my room. I was so uncomfortable I began walking to the nearest grocery store to use the restroom and only using the kitchen when noone is home. Now, a month after moving in, my mother has filed an injunction against my husband (on false allegations, no less) and called in a complaint to child protection (again on false allegations) and now I have no job, no money, no place to live, and I need a lawyer.

What do I do?,9,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1220uo/my_neighbor_is_a_schizophrenic_man_who_does_not/,"I just moved into a new house 3 weeks ago.

My next door neighbor is a middle aged man who walks around the neighborhood a lot kicking trash cans, talking about government conspiracies, and generally talking to himself. He also keeps a giant pile of junk next to his house, very close to my house. Stuff like toasters and microwaves and random junk.

My other neighbors have told me that he's a diagnosed schizophrenic but refuses to take medication. They said he has been on medication before and during that time was totally ""normal"". I'm not sure how long ago he stopped taking the meds or why.

All my neighbors say he is absolutely harmless.

Then a couple of nights ago I was woken up at 2am by a man screaming in a blind rage right outside my house. He was rustling around in the junk pile and screaming about murdering and killing people and various other things. I have never heard someone in such a rage before. I was so terrified I froze and did not call the police.

Then tonight I saw a man walking around my property and heard him talking to himself. He got close enough to set off my motion sensor porch lights twice and I got a quick look at him walking past my window on the other side of the house, but it was so dark I couldn't really tell who it was. I did call the police but they could not find anyone.

Now I can't be sure that the yelling guy and this guy are the schizophrenic neighbor, but I have a feeling it is.

Now what do I do? I don't feel safe anymore and have been having trouble sleeping knowing this guy is around doing this crap at night. Everyone, including my husband, keeps telling me he's harmless and that I'm just being judgmental because he has a mental illness.

I don't have anything against people with mental illness. But I do have a problem with someone having a very unreliable mental illness and refusing to treat it! 

What can I do to start feeling safe in my own home again? I spend most nights alone and I want to be able to sleep comfortably and not get woken up every night by my lights going off and some person talking or screaming to himself outside my house.

TL;DR Schizophrenic neighbor, doesn't take his meds, wanders around the property talking and sometimes screaming scary things at night waking me up and scaring the shit out of me. Neighbors just keep telling me he's harmless. What do I do?

Today he texts me saying that it was his stepdad who bought him the tickets, and his stepdad thought he and him were going. So he politely dis-invites me. I get mildly miffed, as anyone would, since I expected to go to this event for a while now.

It just got worse. He posted a Facebook status about how he's at the event right now. His stepdad just posted a reply saying, ""Enjoy!""

Is it just me, or does that imply that his stepdad isn't actually there? I screencapped the status with the reply so it's not like he can delete it and deny it.

It wasn't charging and I could not change the volume for the ringer or music.  The representative that helped me looked at the phone and thought that my phone was exhibiting some very peculiar behaviors.  After about 5 minutes playing with my device he tells me there is no water damage (based on the fact that the water activated sensors were not color changed) and therefore will replace my phone under warranty. He said that my new iphone will ship to me in 3-5 days and that I should put my damaged iphone into the box the new phone shipped in and return it to Verizon.  So the phone came and I sent the old one back no problem.  

Fast forward a couple months.  I receive a bill in the mail from Verizon and I see a charge for $299 on my bill for ""damaged device""  I immediately call Verizon and they proceed to tell me that upon receiving my device they discovered corrosion on the charge port and that my device had its warranty voided because of it. Im obviously furious at this point because the guy at the store who looked at my phone deemed it a warranty issue and now im being charged for the phone.  The problem here is that i would gladly take my old phone back and try to get it repaired elsewhere but Verizon has a no ship back policy once it gets to the warehouse. So basically im being FORCED into buying this phone.  I feel like Verizon is stealing from me and there's nothing I can do.  I have gone up the hierarchy of customer service managers only to come to the same result.  ""Im sorry, theres nothing we can do for you""  This is outrageous.  They gave me no choice in the matter.  The guy at the store never informed me that this could happen.  I went back to the original store and talked to the manager there.  It was pretty obvious when i described my situation that he wanted me out of the store quickly.  He went on to tell me that there is no way of telling if there is water damage on an Iphone without taking the phone apart.  I know for a fact this is a lie.  It shows on the Apple website two spots on the phone to tell if there has been water damage.  One in the charge port and one in the headphone jack.  
Im extremely upset that im being muscled into paying this fee when I honestly had no idea this could happen.

I have no job (I have no degree in this VERY competitive market and I'm losing hope), I live at home after losing my job and my apartment (I had been totally independent for 15 years), I have exactly $20.09 in my checking account (with no more money coming in, no prospect for money), my boyfriend of 3.5 years is preparing to dump me (I can sense it and know it's coming, this is the man I wanted/thought I was going to marry) and I'm 90% positive that I have developed cervical cancer (I had an abnormal pap smear a few years ago and a colposcopy/biopsy that revealed a high grade abnormality - I lost my job and my insurance before I could have a LEEP procedure so I never had any follow-up treatment, now I have severe abdominal pain and I have abnormal bleeding), my family is broke and nobody can afford to help me, I have no friends - they're all married and busy having babies now. I'm all that's left of the girls who aren't spoken for and it hurts so deeply that I am embarrassed to admit it makes me feel like a failure as a woman.  

I don't qualify for public assistance, I'm too young for a free or reduced cost pap smear, I'm going to college but my tuition eats up any extra money from my financial aid, I used to have an Rx for antidepressants but my doctor won't refill it without a $150 visit, I can't get any private loans because I have medical bills I couldn't pay and have wrecked my credit as a result, and to top it all off I've got two auto-immune diseases that I can't afford to have treated and I'm gradually becoming too sick to function normally.

I'm in trouble and there is no help coming and it's a terrifying feeling. I've got nobody to talk to and everything is crumbling around me and I am powerless to stop it. I am realizing that I'm never going to be a mom, a wife (or a bride) and my dreams, as silly as they seem, will never happen for me. This isn't a solicitation for anything other than to show people how quickly everything you think you have can slip away from you. Life offers you no guarantees. The only thing about all of this that really upsets me or scares me is that if I do have cancer I don't want to die in pain or have my condition financially impact my family, that's the only thing I am afraid of, everything else that will happen and has happened are things that only make me sad and remorseful. 

So Reddit, what would you do if you were in my situation? I have reached rock bottom.

Redditors i need your help.,9,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kkbvb/my_life_is_spinning_out_of_control_help_me_before/,"Ok i don't know where else to turn or where to post this but my life is spinning out of control and i need your guys' input and help. Please forgive me if i posted this in the wrong section but Ive been reading this site for about a year now and enjoy it a lot and have seen a lot of people really uplifted by others on here. I am looking for that in a terrible time for myself. Apologies for any typos or spelling or grammar errors.

Quick Breakdown:
I am 27 years old, trying to get through graduate school, living alone, and struggling with school, addictions, and relationship issues.

I was very motivated in college and high school, top 5% of my class, overachiever the whole 9 yards

Started to drink heavily in college, drinking moved to oxycontin use, then to more drinking then to heavy use of xanax then to use of ecstasy, cocaine, mushrooms, and weed. I used to take 4-5 mg of xanax a day and kicked that habit. It took almost 6 months to do that. I used to take oxycontin a lot as well and kicked that. I have a very addicting and type a personality.

Now through all this drug use I maintained great grades and got into grad school. I partied throughout undergrad and got good grades and met beautiful girls and had plenty of fun and gfs and meaningful relationships. I had friends and everything was going great.

I then entered grad school at which point I was smoking heavy amounts of weed before (months to a year). I did poorly in my first year of grad school and took a year and a half off of school to do ""research"" aka get my life in order. After I came back I continued to smoke marijuana, almost 3-4 grams a day and smoking a pack and a half of cigarettes a day.

I met the girl of my dreams but we always fight. The fights are petty and they are caused by my rage issues. This is brought upon by weed (I think).

I saw numerous shrinks and therapists and after a few cocktails settled on taking some celexa every day. I was feeling normal but still smoking around 3-5 grams of weed a day. I have terrible mood swings, i snap at people, i can't control my emotions, sometimes i get really sad and depressed for no reason...

Ive tried quitting weed and i can't. Ive quit taking xanax and ox and those are physically addicting but weed is hard for me to quit. I am starting school in a month and i continuously rage against my gf and cause fights and yelling and arguments bw us

I know the weed is affecting my brain and taking 40mg of celexa a day (for about 4 months now) could be mixing for a bad combo.

I recently broke up with my gf and have had the strongest urge to kill myself. Ive been thinking about it nonstop mainly bc a lot of people now view me as a failure, my relationship with my gf is in shambles (we broke up and got back together due to my anger and other personal issues and i think this is the last straw)

I know this post sounds weird and is all jumbled but I honestly didn't know what to do. My friends are all moved out of the state, my family shuns me due to my school issues (must be a professional and top of the class or fuck off) and i have no where else to turn

Last night I tried cutting my wrists but didn't have the courage to do it. I want to kill myself but I think its more of giving up. Ive been smoking copious amounts of weed to try to handle the stress of starting school up again and breaking up with my girl.

I finally got my life together, got a new place, was still smoking weed, but had finally gotten ready to start school and do well and now my gf (my life, my other half, she is the only one that understands me and i recently purchased an engagement ring for her) doesn't want anything to do with my raging and my temper tantrums and my craziness.
I think she will not come back to me and the last time we broke up i lost my mind, not eating or sleeping for days and losing tons of weight.

Reddit I have seen you pull someone from the shallow depths of hell to at least feeling good about themselves. For someone who was on the top of the world I am at the bottom and i need someone's help.

Through all this jumble two goals remain clear:
MARRY MY GF AND FINISH GRAD SCHOOL

Two simple goals and my rage and anger is getting in the way. Also i think that weed has now started to affect my emotions and brain from three years of heavy use (in the past three years i have smoked at least 3-4 grams a day EVERY DAY all day with only two 48 hr periods of soberness you could say I am a highly highly functioning weed/drug addict)

Now i am smoking tons more weed and even thinking about taking xanax and i can't stop thinking about my gf who dumped me

I thought I was doing well but recently, (Im 22 now), ive been having vivid nightmares of everything. I think he is still teaching and it haunts me that he could have done it to some one else.

Background: I'm an only child, Asian, parents are immigrants, we live in Canada. 

Sadly, the first conversation I remember having with my mom about my dad is that I was an accident and that he wanted an abortion. He didn't make the birth, but ""changed his mind"" once he saw me. A chunk of my childhood memories consist of conversations with my mom, crying because he gambled away all our money (joint account, she earned much more than he did). I grew up believing her when she said she'd divorce him when I turned 18. At one point my mom was convinced that he was cheating on her. 

An example of his shitty parenting? My mom would slave away in a manufacturing plant and leave me in his care. He would take me to a racetrack and proceed to gamble (her) money away. He would leave a 5 year old girl in a tiny arcade, alone and unsupervised, in a racetrack. Inevitably, one day I had to go to the washroom and got lost. I still remember crying, in a neon yellow Mickey Mouse shirt, asking random adult men if they had seem someone who looked like my dad. Eventually, a security guard helped me find him. 

In high school, minus explosive temper tantrums, he got better and stopped his heavy gambling. I managed to get enough scholarships to pay for college tuition, and have landed a great job. In the past couple of years, it's like a switch has been turned off - household chores without complaint, volunteering to drive us everywhere, rarely any arguments... 

My issue is that I don't trust him or his motives. He has no retirement money saved up, my mom does. He knows that I (likely with my career) should be well-off in the future. If he didn't have us, he would literally have nothing. My mom says she didn't divorce him because he got better and she doesn't want to live the rest of her life without a partner. I think I hate him, but it's been easy to ""forget"" that because of the recent normalcy.

Our family does not do feelings, nor do we have conversations about our feelings. If I brought this up now I would probably bring them back to how things were a decade ago (e.g., I don't know what my mom would do if she found out he won $25k, never told her, and then lost it all through stocks). I have never been hugged by my parents. I know my mom loves me through her actions. My dad, on the other hand... I just feel like I am one fucked up kid. How do I sort my feelings out? 

Thanks for reading. I guess this also belongs in r/offmychest/... have never told anyone the full story because I like to pretend like nothing's wrong.

TL;DR - Shitty dad up until university. Don't trust him now because I feel like he's faking it for my mom's/my money.",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_1jxjyv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jxjyv/how_do_i_get_over_conflicting_feelings_about_my/,

I am a M who has been in a relationship with a F for over a year and a half now.  Our first 7-months were fantastic and we fell in love very quickly, spending every possible moment with each other.  After those initial months, she started to get hurt and upset when I would make plans with my large group of close friends that I didn't okay with her first.  Her logic being that it was a decision I was making for ""me""  vs. a decision I was making for ""us,"" that she is just one of many people in my life vs. someone special in my life.  My friends and I all have similar career goals, and are part of the same creative community working together on projects and towards the same thing, so it's important that I maintain a good friendship with them.  My gf is introverted (which I respect) and wants no part of this group of co-ed friends (mostly male), but I guess I never really understood why it wasn't okay for me to have these friendships and sense of community for myself and have a girlfriend whom I love and support at the same time.  I feel like she has taken away my freedom to be a part of this community of friends and she feels that I don't understand her at all. This has been the point of contention for the past year, and a few months ago I ended up moving in with one of my friends, instead of her, with hopes that she and I could patch things up before she and I made a move in together ourselves.  As you can guess this has made things worse.  I only go to her place and stay there nearly half the week, she refuses to come to my place because it makes her feel uncomfortable.  Now we are less connected than ever, and I am still not as connected to my friends, and I feel like moving in with her would have given her the comfort of me coming home to her every night, despite being out and doing what I need to do with friends/community.  I feel like any sane person would just walk away from the relationship, but I have never stopped loving her despite all of this.  She doesn't seem to be walking away from the relationship either. It might be out of fear, but I feel it could also be out of a shimmer of hope that it will be okay, but I am feeling like she is not meeting me halfway to put things in the right direction for the two of us, which isn't something I can force her to do.

The house is in a cul-de-sac and we have a retired elderly couple living next door to us (late 60’s  I’d say)We’ll call the wife Mildred and the husband Eugene. Since my family has moved in, our neighbors have done everything they can to make us as uncomfortable as possible. Just us though, none of the other neighbors seem to have any issues with them. I honestly think these fuckers have nothing better to do. 

Anyways, a little after we first moved in they started putting mothballs all along the adjacent fence to us to keep our cats out of their yard. Mothballs are really harmful to cats and can destroy their liver if ingested. They also have an extremely yappy ass dog that the let out every time we were in our backyard doing anything, (not really a huge complaint, but I swear its only whenever we are out there). If not, they will sit outside on their driveway every day with their wiener dogs. No biggie, its your house, I could however do without your piercing demonic stares every time I’m outside as well. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I AM OUTSIDE I AM BEING WATCHED BY THE WRINKLE EYES

My street usually has quite a few cars parked on it and I have to park my car in the street as well. Luckily there’s a space in the cul-de-sac between our houses that I can park my car in and walk up my driveway. Well,  every single trash day, while everybody else puts their trash on the sidewalk, they put their trash cans in the street. Conveniently in the only place I’m able to park without walking a little ways. Well we had just moved in and I didn’t want to make a huge deal about it, so I moved the cans out of the way and kindly explained I needed to park there and asked them if they wouldn’t mind put them on the sidewalk (which is closer in the first place), Mildred told me not to touch their trash again and for me to find somewhere else to park or they were calling the cops. Really now Mildred?  I know what ill do, ill just park my car with the bumper on the curb and the car sticking out into the cul-de-sac next to the trash can since she’s being such a royal cunt. I’ve seen other people do it, it should be fine. I came out a little later to a ticket  on my windshield and little Mildred thanking the cop as she left.  Apparently your car has to be parked against the curb in a cul-de-sac. Well shit.
 
A mobile mechanic came to my house to do some repairs on my car the other day, working on my car in 100 degree heat, (my car now parked the correct way in the circle, luckily it wasn’t trash day) As he was working  away, Eugene came out of his house to tell him,  “I am a part of the homeowners association, and you need to get your tools off the grass because you are killing it” This is in OUR yard, not his. The mechanic working on my car got really uncomfortable after this, as our neighbors sat outside staring at him and I the entire time after the comment was made. The mechanic we have gone through for years no longer wants to come to us because the bullies next door can’t mind their own business. WHAT!?

To put the cherry on top of their bullshit sundae, yesterday as I was leaving, driving down my street to go the store, here comes Eugene in his giant 2013 Dodge Ram driving home the opposite way on my street.  there were no other cars on this particular part of the street at the time and like any normal, sensible person would  I pulled my little Honda over to the right, as I did this motherfucker pulled as close to me as he could (im talking literally inches away) HONKING at me trying to run me off the road! WHAT THE FUCK

This is absolutely ridiculous and we are at our limit with these old fuckers. Any ideas on how to deal with or fuck with these demonic neighbors ? Remember: they are elderly so I don’t want to do anything that extensive, but they deserve more than a little taste of their own disgusting medicine. Help me out reddit!

I was just offered it and I am ecstatic. The only thing I am worried about is how to break it to my current employer. They are a very small company and turnover is very low. It’s just past the start up stage and the team is pretty close. I checked my contract and it is an ‘at will working relationship’ which is to my benefit because it means I can quit or they can terminate me at any time for no cause, but I don’t want to burn any bridges or have a super awkward conversation..

How do I quit? I have never quit from an office before because I have only had temp internships. Any advice or insight would be helpful!!!

Last night me and my girlfriend where taking things easy, just relaxing as usual. A family member of her's jokingly called her fat a few days before and I was messing and joking saying she had bingo wings. She was perfectly ok, we joke all the time like this in our relationship (for example she comments on my torso all the time, squeezing my ""breasts"". I am abit chubby).

After that she slapped me and it hurt, I'm not going to lie, act tough because I'm a man but it really hurt. I sat up and told her it hurt and she just kept smiling and doing gestures to indicate I was crying. My facial tone had completely changed at this moment. I asked her to say sorry and she just laughed. I could feel the heat, y'know when you get angry you feel a sort of warmth rushing around your body or to your head. So she tried to roll off the bed still laughing and I asked her to say sorry again and she wouldn't while I was trying to roll her back onto the bed. She then kicked me twice into the chest, again hurting. 

I held her down for three or four seconds and hit her a slap in the face. I'm not proud, I feel like shit, I feel like I should not be here, that I should never have someone in my life, that I should die alone. Once I had done it I jumped up, left the room, might have said something in anger (can't remember what) and went downstairs. I stood in the kitchen, shook like a leaf, began crying and went back up to see if she was ok.

She just kept saying she wanted to go (all understandable). I asked for just two seconds to explain and she let me eventually. I hugged her, told her how much I was sorry, that I would never hurt her on purpose, that I love her. In her defense to the slap she hit me with, she said she was joking and she didn't hit me hard, she tried to tell me it didn't hurt me, that she would of said sorry eventually. I walked her home, we got halfway and she didn't want to walk her further. She said she wants time to herself. Every time I asked was it over she just kinda kept smiling.

If you’re here for some points or whatever the prize for answering is please click away. I’m hoping to find one meaningful response that will help me out. I’m going to describe my life and situation in as few words as possible and hopefully you can get a sense of who I am and where I’m coming from.
I’m a 17 year old male going into my senior year of high school this September. Each year I attend a different school. My mom moves us a lot because of how poor we are. I consider myself smarter than most and even good looking. If you were to see me in person you would assume I was rich and even a model. I only say this because it’s what I’m told. I realize it might sound conceited and self centered and I might be because most of the kids my age I’m encounter disgust me. They have so much more opportunity than me and it’s just wasted. I feel like an old angry man in a teenager’s body.

I don’t have nice things like a cell phone or laptop most of the year I don’t even have cable &amp; internet. And yeah you guessed it my mom’s on welfare so are house is covered by the government and trust me its humiliating. I’ve been homeless before too, last summer we had to sleep in the car in Wal-Mart parking lots and sneak into campgrounds to use the showers.
Every dollar I get from my mom or from the little things I do to get cash go towards nice dressy clothing used to disguise who I truly am. I fool people by dressing up and looking good because I’m terrified of being picked on. Don’t tell me not to worry about what people think either because I constantly tell myself that and it should help that I only know them for less than a year but it doesn’t I can’t help it I have no confidence. I’ve gotten that feeling in your chest where your heart sinks more than enough times that’s why I try to play the role prince and keep to myself as best as possible. The problem is my grades in school and I didn’t do great these first three years because I just didn’t realize how much they mattered. My mom didn’t help either it’s not like there was any way of punishing me I had nothing she could really take and she never gave real motivation. So I just slacked off and focused on keeping my true identity a secret from my peers. Half way through this past school year I really started trying and both 3rd and 4th quarters I received nearly straight A’s on my report card.

So what can I do. In one year I’m going to be done with high school and my current plan is I will join the Air Force and serve 4 years and then go to college using the GI bill and major in Computer Science. I’m confident that I can pass my senior year with straight A’s in every course; I’m going to work as hard as possible. I will work my *** off to get good SAT scores as well but when the year is over I don’t think any nice university is going to accept me because of my past 3 years. And even if they did I couldn’t afford it because I’m dirt poor. That’s why I want to join the military free education; I’m told it sounds good to employers and will help better me as a person.

I want to own a Porsche a nice house and have relationship with the perfect girl. I want to be a part of the 1% and don’t tell me money doesn’t buy happiness or to be realistic because it’s all I think about 24/7 I want it more than anything. I want to be close to that 1%. It's my dream that I would kill for.What’s a good path for me to take out of high school? If you could restart and be in my shoes with all your knowledge what would be your next step after high school.

Know that after I graduate next year I will be on my own with no car and probably no good friends I need a plan. I’ve done my research on the USAF and no I will have no problem with enlisting but I just don’t know if that’s the smartest route to take after school.

At the time I was living on a farm with a flock of ducks and some goats, and planning to get sheep. I planned to train the border collie to be a herding dog.

Flash forward to the present: My landlord has kicked me off the farm (he wanted to move back with his family), and all my farm dreams are hold. I took a job at a restaurant working full time in order to save money to someday buy a place (no more dealing with shitty landlords.) I have come to terms with losing the farm I was living on, but I still have my border collie puppy. He is 5 months old now, and I hardly have any time to spend with him because of my job. On top of that I am looking for a new place to live (my lease is up in November), and am finding that it is very hard to find a place to rent when you have a dog. My life would be so much easier without my puppy, and I am concerned that by leaving him alone all the time he will develop bad/neurotic behaviors. I feel so bad about it, because I do love him and he is so sweet when we are together, but I am considering selling him to someone who will be able to use him in his intended role as a farm dog.

This breaks my heart, and I would like to stick it out with the little guy, but I worry about how I am not able to provide him with what he really needs. Food, shelter, vet and affection when I'm around, sure, but he should be on a farm herding sheep, not cooped up in my house 10 hours a day.

what do you think, reddit?

Also, sorry about my grammar, it's horrible and i know it.

I am a 24 year old male, fresh out of the Army where i was a tank crew member, though i never did much on a tank, i did a lot of (slave) work. Cleaning, guard duty and stuff like that.

I am now back in my hometown, a shitty place with little to no job opportunity aside from McDonald's, Burger King, grocery stores (all offering part time only at minimum wage) I would have to pick up 3 of these at least to support my family at a below poverty level. 

We live with my wife's parents at the moment who are retired, and i have enough saved up to support us for a while buying just the essentials, though gas is draining us pretty bad.

Here's the problem i have now. I spent the last four years of my life gaining next to no work skills, cleaning and sitting at a desk don't really translate into real world skills, and for some reason when i go to interviews at places such as McDonald's i am overqualified for a basic service industry job, but not enough for a managerial position. 

 I am in with multiple temporary staffing agencies as well, some up to 100 miles away and none of them have offered me anything. I go through all of the checks with them. Background, drug, resume and they say there are openings, and there probably are, but even for the lowest paying menial labor around here, i am at competition with 1000's of other people due to GM closing down and the general shitty economy around here. 

I spend Hours a day, online looking for openings, going the places that actually are hiring, filling out forms, interviewing and being told i'm not right for the position, or they found someone more qualified. Most of the time i hear nothing at all.

I have one two year old and another on the way, and no house to put them in. I feel we are becoming a burden on my in laws, even after two months of being here. I would Love to go to school and learn Computer Networking, and it would be covered, but that would leave me limited time to work and support my family.

So, what can i do? I'm at a stand still.

TLDR: I want to support my family and am willing to work minimum wage jobs to do so, but i also want to further my education at the same time. The economy left my hometown job market in shambles and the Army left me with next to no real world skills.

Me and my bf moved in with him 3 months ago, he was my best friend at the time, and an extremely responsible person from what I could tell. We moved into a nice 4 br house which we could easily afford with 3 of us paying all the bills.
Me and my bf had been giving him our share of the bills so that he could go pay them for about 2 months, and I never once had any doubts that I couldnt trust him. Until about 2 months in, our Comcast was shut off. I work from home so this was a big deal, I lost a whole day of work for this. 
So I called comcast and they told me no payments had ever been made on that account. I called the power. same story. He had been taking our money (about $700 at least by then) and not paying our bills.
I confronted him about it and he acted like it was all an accident, and promised he would fix it. 
I had to borrow $400 from my mom to pay the comcast bill, and told him he had to pay it back to her within 2 weeks. He promised. even said he was working overtime to pay it back. a month and a half later it still hadnt been paid back and he was planning on his sister coming to stay with us for a week. (he also never buys groceries so I was wondering what she was going to eat) I told him if he hadnt paid my mom back by the time she was coming to stay, that she couldnt stay. so he promised. and he wrote a check to my mom. his sister came to stay. then a couple of days after she leaves, i get an email from my mom about the check being declined. 
On top of all that, we kept finding toilet paper (yes toilet paper) missing in our bathroom, which is in our bedroom, so we asked him if he had been taking it, and he said no. we looked under his bathroom sink and sure enough there was our toilet paper. I know it seems small, but to me that is stealing. 
You would think it ends there.. but sadly it doesnt.
One day i needed a password to one of our utility accounts which was sent to his email. and he wasnt home. i called him and he told me to go onto his laptop to retrieve it. I went into his email...and to my astonishment there were several hundred email replies to a craigslist post offering ""adult services"" in return for money. I have kids, and I am now wondering if he has been bringing ""clients"" back to my house with my kids sleeping in the next room!
It seems to be a never-ending supply of surprises with him now....it keeps getting worse. 
so why not just kick his ass out right? well we would if we could. We can't afford the rent and bills on this place by our selves. and we cant move out until the lease is up. so what the hell do i do???

We have been going to family therapy for about two month because we weren't getting along. Ever since our son was born things were'nt going well. I had the feeling the therapy was going well. We even bought a new car a few week ago. But all of a sudden she doesn't want this anymore. I have been trying my best so this really comes as a shock to me ...

Whats the right thing to do?

Thats the situation ... during therapy my wife was complaining about different things from week to week and i really did my best to improve the situation. But really i had the impression she was just looking for reasons to complain (like house work, which i have been doing exclusively for the most part). Buying a new car was not one of the things i wanted to do but she feelt it was necessary so we did that ... it's not like the money was easily spared but i'm prepared to cut my losses. With all thats been going on thats the least of my concerns.

What really pains me is how i'm going to keep a relation with my son ... as the situation stands i will have to move. which means moving closer to where my job is - i have been working remotely until now. i don't want to loose the connection i have to my son.

what should it do? lawyer up or stick it out for my son?

Edit: my wife wants to quit the relationship - divorce is not (yet) on the table from here side. but continuing like this (without a divorce) doesn't appear to be the right course for me. should i persue divorce (and moving out) now or should i stay with my son and keep living with my wife?",,False,,t5_2qjdm,1372527593.0,,,True,t3_1hbg55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hbg55/wife_wants_to_call_it_quits/,

1370900777.0,6,self.Advice,1g2ocv,"I feel like as if my Dad loves my autistic brother, but not me...",6,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g2ocv/i_feel_like_as_if_my_dad_loves_my_autistic/,"So, I'll try and give you a brief overview of this situation. I am seventeen years of age, my brother is eighteen (one in question) and my eldest brother is 20. As for my parents, I have my Dad (one in question) and my Mum.

I've always got on really, really well with my Mum. I know most people do, but we share similar interests for instance we got adore theme parks. She's loving, caring and I've talked to her (and she's aware of the situation) numerous times about this. My Mum works part time, she quit her job when she we expecting my eldest, and for the first few years, was merely a housewife. Since she has held down a low part time job to help pay the bills.

&lt;b&gt; My Dad &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Whereas my Dad is the main contributor to the family financially, he owns a figure of £70,000+ a year, but it's one of those jobs which are full on. He works practically all day, all week, he chooses his own hours at his office downtown. He is a funny, loving character. But due to his job, I really only see him in the evenings, and he's usually stressed so he seems to snap a lot. But he's one of those men he love in his own way, for instance if I mentioned that I like a particular brand of clothing, then he will send me loads of presents of that brand.

&lt;b&gt; My brother &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
And then going into my brother Robert, he suffers from autism. I'm not quite sure the specifics of it, but he's autistic. My Dad and he have always been very close, but he seems to (hate to put it this way) care for my Mum more, whenever there's an issue, it's always my Mum he goes to, when he stays overnight in a hospital, it's always her that stays. I'm not going to talk about the relationship me and my brother share, because its irrelevant, but unless you understand what autism is, the best way to describe it for me (growing up) is an eleven year old in a mans body. He's not severe, as I said, it's basically for me, the same as having a little brother.

&lt;b&gt; My Relationship with my Dad&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
When I was growing up, I have absolutely no memories of him, and my Mum (I think she regrets it) reveals that she practically raised us single handily. The only memories I share with my Dad and I, one on one, was when he took me to these exhibitions he liked. Those, are the only two memories I share with my Dad, for the last sixteen years. Oh, and he did drive me to rugby and back as a kid.

I feel, and I've this isn't just going on in my head, others notice it too, that he's never saying anything positive about me. He's always having a go at me for doing things, he's always saying succeed in life. He never opens a conversation with me, it's always me trying to make it. During the conversation, he's never continuing it on, he usually just gives one word answers. The usual Dad, from what I pick up, is someone who you come in from school and they ask how it went, how you are etc. He just says 'hi.'  

We share A LOT of common interests, for instance were both heavily into football. As I said, I only see him in the evenings. I watch the occasional game with him, I see him at dinner, and I see him round the house, that is it. 

&lt;b&gt; His relationship with my brothers &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
He used to commonly collide with my eldest brother when he was a teen, they argued a lot. Recently though, he's joined my Dads work and is working his way up, so they get on really well. They talk about football a lot, for instance, but my brother is rarely in nowadays. He's either working, with his girlfriend, or out with his mates, he's not one for the 'quiet night in.'

Whereas my brother with autism, Robert, it's a completely different story. My Dad frequently gets up, three hours before he's meant to, to say goodbye to Robert before he leaves in the morning. When my brother Robert gets halfway there, my Dad calls him to make sure everything is fine. At the end of my brothers day, my Dad takes his break to go and meet my brother (most days) by a local cafè for lunch. 

He's always talking to my brother, asking how his day was and how he's doing, what he's been up to. He frequently takes my brother out of day trips to do what my Robert wants to do, and I am invited, but it's never me deciding what we want to do.

If there's an issue with my brothers computer, my Dad always drops what he's doing to fix if, and if it fails, he spends top dollar getting it fixed as soon as possible. Whereas for instance, my laptop which contains all my work is faulty and playing up when I need it for my GCSE's (seriously like DT.) He fixes it when he gets round to it, usually a week after the issue, if I ask for it to be sooner, then I'm labelled as wining and he won't do it. Now you tell me prioritise GCSE work &gt; playing games. Another example (this is no lie) my brother Robert says 'Hey Dad' and my Dad relplies with 'Hey how are you?' Then seconds later I say 'what's up Dad?' And he replies with 'for Godsake what is it?'

&lt;b&gt; Summary &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
I'm not going to lie to you Reddit, I'm jealous of my brother and my dads relationship. My brother obviously loves him, but doesn't appreciate it, he expects it now, I'm jealous that somehow he can turn into a genuine Dad for my brother, but completely switches off for me. As I said, you may think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not, my eldest recognises it, my Mum recognises it, my grandparents recognise it.

If you can't already tell, it feels like as if he hates me.  The only person I've talked about this out of the family actually agrees with me because he's seen it first hand. He's my best friend, and I've asked him and he just said 'he loves you, in his own type of way, but he is a dick to you.'

And that's true, I doubt he hates me, because we do occasionally share some nice moments. When I speak to my grandmother (his side of the family, not the ones aware) she always says how he sings praises for me. I know their really close, and she knows everything that's going on with me, even when I don't speak to her as much as I should.

My Mum actually mentioned it to him at one stage, and things started to change for a few weeks, but then it just went back to normal. I'm just so confused, and I would like any advice if possible. 

I hate to be that kid who's feeling sorry for themselves. In reality, I've got a very good Dad, he finances the family, gives it support, and loves them and is still very much involved. Whereas many, have lost their dear fathers, never knew them, or had abusive ones.

Final Point:
Lastly, because this has turned out to be an essay, I'm in no way angry that he gives my autistic so much attention, as I said I've grown up with it. I appreciate he will demand a lot more, I'm just confused about how he shows so much open love for my brother, but not to me. This issue has been raised, so it's not like he's oblivious, but it feels like he's always snapping at me. I understand that I will come off as &lt;b&gt; very selfish &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; but without knowing the situation first hand, you wouldn't understand it fully I'm afraid. It's not a major issue, it's not like there's tension at the dinner table, it's just an issue I would like to speak anonymously over the Internet about.

&lt;b&gt; I WOULD PREFER IT IF YOU WERE GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW HE HAS SPECIAL NEEDS, THAT YOU DO SO WITH ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION. SO I AM PARTICULARLY LOOKING FOR ADVICE FROM PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND TO SOME EXTENT, THE DIVERSITY OF ADULTS WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES. THANK YOU. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;


Summary:

Petting him is a chore. Seeing him when I return home from work brings me little joy - joy that is far outweighed by all other time and financial responsibility. The only reason I would keep him is for him. I just don't care anymore. 

I resent him. I don't like feeling guilty when I am away. I don't like feeling obligated to be at home. I want to be free. I'm a 20 something bachelor. I don't intend to be married anytime soon largely because I want to enjoy freedom in my youth.

I want to pick up for the weekend and travel somewhere without having to pay a sitter $100. I want to stay at random places guilt-free whenever I want. 

I hate the shedding. I hate the neediness. 

That said, he's a great dog. [Beautiful](http://i.imgur.com/RrdLS.jpg). I found him as a puppy in college. 4.5 years old now. Someone once offered me $1000 for him when he was a pup. He listens well. Very house broken. Fetches like a robot. Comes when you call him. Downsides - he likes to bark (not incessantly, but I prefer 0 barking), there's a 5% chance he will be aggressive with a stranger dog (though he is well socialized) - he would never hurt a person. HE LOVES PEOPLE; that's also a downside in a way, he is an attention *whore*. 

I feel bad. It's a poor show of character on my part. I care for him some, but I just don't want him. Kids in the future? Another dog? Man, this would sow some doubts. If I gave him up, I would be diligent in finding a good home. A home better than what I provide despite his attachment to me. 

TL;DR Good dog. Disinterested owner feeling guilty.

Okay, I am a student in High School. My parents are fairly busy so they leave for work before I leave for school. Meaning, I have to wake myself up for school and so on. So if I want, I can sleep in and skip school without my parents being able to do anything about it.

Problem is, I have no discipline. I know I shouldn't be skipping and I dont even want to, but in the mornings if I am tired I will just go back to sleep. I have no self control or discipline. I KNOW I shouldnt be doing so, everyone tells me that and thats not the advice I want. I want to be able to develop discipline and self control.

In the nights, I'd tell myself ""Okay, there is school tomorrow and I need/should go!"" but in the morning I'd BS myself into thinking that I'll be fine with sleeping in. It is not simply a matter of laziness, its almost like an addiction. I dont know what I can do?!

If I should sleep early then I may do so, but I need discipline to put myself in bed at x o' clock rather than just staying up Redditting or something. I always procrastinate on my assignments and everything, so if I could form some discipline, self control and time management I'd be able to work on that too.

It started around this time last year when my girlfriend of around 7 months left me. I was really hurt as we had grown really close and talked or saw each other most days throughout the week. She said she didn't want to be with me unless I got my shit together: a job, better marks at uni and less drugs (I was a weekend warrior). 

Over two weeks I stopped partying so hard on the weekends, got a job on the nightshift at a local convenience store and started doing much better at university. She still left and I sorta lost it. 

Over the last year I've spent most of my time throughout the week at home, alone, chilling out and watching tv shows. 

I usually see about one friend during the week and then see multiple on the weekends, where I get crazy wasted as I live in a binge drinking city. 

I'm unhappy. I have a job in retail now on fridays and saturdays, where my passive aggressive managers give me shit about not being bubbly enough even though my sales are really great. They're gay and quite flamboyant, expecting me to act the same. I like them and have no issues with homosexual people at all, but it's hard for me to act like that. 

I now commute from home to a university which is an hour and twenty minutes away on public transport (I don't drive). 

I've done a lot of things to hurt myself, not physically, but emotionally, and constantly feel like I'm dealing with that. I also hardly ever go to uni now as I feel anxious and uncomfortable there and haven't made any friends because I transferred there and most people seem pretty immature. I still get pretty good grades, doing all my shit from home.

I guess I just don't know how to gain the motivation to go there or make real relationships with new people because I've fucked up so much and fuck myself up to the point where I'm scared of regular members of society.

I tried just using my electric razor on everything. It has a little buzzer popout thing. I shaved pretty much all of my pubic hair without problem. Even got most of my ass hair. Its still a little stubbly, but I havent felt any problems with it yet.

My armpits however, are a disaster. I shaved them the same way I went about shaving my pubic hair. As I was finishing they started to get red and rashy. I also kicked a couple places I think. They are starting to hurt pretty bad now, it feels like somebody is rubbing sand paper on them.

Only my brother-in-law(16 at the time) and his 16 year old girlfriend was there at any given time not counting my Family. So I told my wife it was gone and I told her he had to have stole it. She defends him saying it must have been a thief. I knew that could not be the case because a thief would not have went to my hidden safe in the closet and left many other valuables laying around. Long story short I bided my time and watched as he went on mass spending sprees for new clothes, new shoes, and a multitude of other expensive purchases which he couldn't afford himself because I was supporting him and he had no job. So I confronted him and he cried and admitted the theft to me. He begged my forgiveness as did my wife so I forgave him under the terms that he pays me back. About a year and 10 months later he moves back with his father in my wife's home state. My wife did as well because I got hurt on the job and was unable to work. 2 months went by I tied loose ends in state A and went to be with my wife and children in state B. I get there my wife has a place already. I move in, I have been and continue to pay the bills. He does not live with us for awhile. Then me wife's father calls and tells me he has been kicked out (they are living with his new wives father) because the owner of the residents has his reasons(probably because he was just bumming and stealing there too) and asks me if he can come stay with us again. My response is a no thank you I have lost enough and spent enough on his behalf. Well one day my wife brings him in saying he has no where to go blahblahblah. So he moves in with us. A few months go by and one day I notice I am missing $300 out of my emergency stash I had hidden in the kitchen, I immediately confront him he says he had nothing to with it.

Her mother who is the landlord also goes crazy and comes over and jumps on me and then calls the law in an attempt to have me removed from the residents. Currently he is still staying here and the mother-in-law is going thru the eviction process to have me removed. My daughters are 4 and 5 and are my concerns here.

1367759364.0,6,self.Advice,1dq9x9,How can I convince a loved one to see a doctor who seriously needs it? [x-post r/AskReddit],6,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dq9x9/how_can_i_convince_a_loved_one_to_see_a_doctor/,"After browsing [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dpgrz/what_is_something_that_your_body_does_that/) of people who don't go to the doctor, I was reminded of a personal struggle in my life.


**Background:**
My mother has a very obvious medical problem. Her belly is grotesquely enlarged much like in [this pic](http://imgur.com/bnR1f6B), probably even a little bigger. Besides the physical issue, this problem has really impacted other areas of her life. She no longer sees any of her old friends because of how embarrassed she is by it (only visiting with a few close relatives) and she doesn't go out of the house much except for running errands. I can tell her self-esteem has become very low in the years this thing has gotten worse.

The thing is, *she is absolutely terrified to go and see a doctor, even for a diagnosis.* Both my aunt and I have confronted her on it numerous times, but she completely shuts down, getting defensive and acting like we're attacking her.

***

Every time she's confronted on it she either lies about eventually going or goes on the defensive. These are some of the things she's said before:

- *""I am going to go, but I want to get healthy first before seeing the doctor. I'm going to start eating right for the next few months, you just have to give me time and let me go on my own.""*

She has used this delaying tactic for years. She never goes, even when we agree on a date for her to make an appointment. When the date rolls around, she just tells me to worry about myself and that I have no business telling her what to do with her life.

- *""You want me to go to the doctor because you want me to die. I know doctors, they'll tell you something's wrong and you only have so much time left to live. Then you believe them and die soon after because their authority to tell you how long you have. If they tell me that, my mind will believe it and tell my body to shut down. Is that what you want? You just want me to die already don't you.""*

Here she relies on the superstition that if she doesn't go to the doctor, her mind won't let her condition worsen. The whole hear no evil, see no evil hocus pocus. Topped with the hurtful attack on me like I actually want to see her die.

- *""I don't have the money. I'm not insured. I'll go broke and lose the house, lose everything and end up on the streets!""*

She's not broke. Though she hasn't worked in years, she has an inheritance that has let her pay the bills and mortgage for years and many to come. She doesn't qualify for any govt. assistance, and keeps the amount of her inheritance a total secret. Although I'm sure she'd have to make unwilling sacrifices to pay for the doctor, it's just another excuse in the end. 

***

Reddit, what can I do? I've tried everything from leaving persistent gentle reminders, to serious sit-downs, to threatening her. Maybe I didn't do them right (I haven't delivered on my threats/didn't give the right kind of threat), but I've tried so many things. 

I know it's her life and all, but I know deep-down she really does want to address her medical problem. Many times when the topic comes up, she tells me sometimes she thinks it'd be better if she finally went to the doctor and 'just die' because of how unhappy she's become over the years. I'm willing to do anything and everything I can to give her the courage not to live the rest of her life like that.


**Any stories or advice would be sincerely appreciated**

**TL;DR: Mom has a medical condition where her [belly](http://imgur.com/bnR1f6B) is severely enlarged. Too afraid to even get a diagnosis. She's become very unhappy and reclusive because of it.

I don't like giving out personal info, but I need to at least tell you where I live in so the suggestions are more helpful. I live in Waterloo Region, Ontario (CAN).

I got a cheque yesterday for $596 (my monthly entitlement for my disability -- bipolar disorder). I'm currently homeless, and until yesterday was staying at a homeless shelter. They evicted me because, even though it was a homeless shelter, I am required to pay $375 for board/lodging.

I ended up spending my whole cheque on drugs.

I am now in a situation where I have no food, no money, NOTHING.

A ""friend"" of mine said I can stay with him for the month, but the problem is that he is an active IV drug user. His roommates also do drugs -- heroin, crack, meth, Wellbutrin... Obviously, this is not an ideal place to stay, but I don't seem to have any other options.

Right now I haven't eaten in 3 days, and I can't even go to the food bank until Monday (they're closed on the weekends).

I am SO desperate to stop using drugs, but after my parents kicked me out of their house in January, things have just been totally downhill. I am incredibly depressed and think about suicide often. I just want out of this nightmare.

I don't really deserve any help because I put myself into this situation, but could someone please give me some hope that I can eventually turn things around and stay clean? I love my parents/siblings SO much and it KILLS me that I keep screwing up and letting them down. All I want in life is for them to be proud of me and not stay up all night worrying if I am going to die.

We're all in our late 20's to early 40's. A 19 year old girl lives nearby and showed up late into the festivities. I wanted to tell her the shirt was not flattering (we're close enough to give those types of opinions), but I put it in the worst possible way. I was drunk, didn't think about it, and said ""that shirt doesn't look good. It makes you look fat."" 

Most girls are sensitive about weight, and she is on the heavier side so I should have thought better of it. Now she's all upset and wont speak to me and deleted me on facebook (I think that means a lot these days).

Anyway, I want to make it right. Should I just be nice to her and give some sincere compliments every once in a while or should I apologize? Apologizing could be tricky because I really don't want to bring up the word 'fat' again. I don't want her to think about what I said and get angry from a poor choice in words. Soooo what should I do?


Edit: Thanks for the advice, everyone. I'm going to apologize via text. I'm a straight-forward person and really hate getting into long, dramatic conversations if at all possible. I hope to avoid that. Guess I should watch what I say for now on, huh??

1367214759.0,6,self.Advice,1dbm70,"Torn between doing a homeland security internship in Washington, D.C., or taking intensive mandarin language courses for the summer (story inside).",6,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dbm70/torn_between_doing_a_homeland_security_internship/,"Preemptive apology for the wall of text....

For my summer break I have two options: 1) take intensive mandarin language courses over the summer, or 2) take a paid internship at a homeland security consulting firm in D.C. 

On the surface it look like an easy choice, but here's why its not. 

My focus in graduate school is on international security and asian studies - specifically China. It is my hope (crosses fingers) that when I graduate in a year I can get a job with the US State Department as an Asian policy analyst. I've had numerous professors tell me that Chinese language skills are held as a premium within the State Department and the Intelligence Community. So that's one big + for the language program. I'd be developing a very important skill that I can build on during the school year w/ additional mandarin classes.

The internship at the consulting firm would help me break into the DC network (since DC is very much a relationship-based town). This will obviously help me down the line when I am looking for jobs. Plus, having a security consulting firm on the resume never hurt anybody. On the downside, this firm has a mostly domestic border-security focus; its only international focus is on latin america, not asia. I'm not interested in border security exactly. Plus I wouldn't be developing any new skills, nor would I get any security clearance. 

I've been going back and forth on this for the past week, talking to any knowledgable people I know. The basic gist of my problem is this: 

What will help me in my career the most (w/ an eye towards the State Department)? Will it be the network (which *could* enable me to break into DC and then move laterally to State at a later time) or the language skills (which would add significant points to my application at State, assuming they're hiring in a year).

I’ve known my boyfriend’s sister, “Laura,” for a few years now and believe me when I say that we’ve never hit it off. At all. My boyfriend is closest to her in his family, and so I put in a great deal of effort to be friendly to her because I knew it would mean a lot to him, and since they’re so close I knew that she would be a major part of my life, too.

With that being said, I started our relationship off with going out of my way to be friendly to her, as in putting in effort to get to know her, to include her in things, and invite her out—I have never received this in return. Our relationship was extremely one-sided from the start, and after the first year and a half of receiving nothing but the cold shoulder from her, her hobby of making me as uncomfortable as possible at every encounter, and her constant usage of mind games, I decided to back off. 

Another huge reason as to why I stepped away from her was because it got to the point that I would feel AWFUL being around her—even through text! My self esteem would plummet, I would feel beneath her, and I would also become physically sick when I would be anticipating a family function that included her because I was so wracked with nerves and panic at the thought of seeing her. I deal with so many types of people on a daily basis, but never ONCE have I ever had these feelings come over me before. Things have become even worse because she scrutinizes my every move, I feel sickeningly self conscious around her, and every move I make around her is apparently WRONG. I could do one thing, say, talk to her, and she’ll be upset. Suppose I don’t talk to her, though, and she’s furious with that, too! I could invite her out and she’s angry and makes it clear that she doesn’t want to do anything with me, but when I go out with my boyfriend, suddenly I’m hearing her sarcastic and bitter, “Well, thanks for inviting ME, I guess,"" and I receive a huge guilt trip. These are just a few examples out of many. 

I’ve tried numerous times explaining to my boyfriend about how I feel, but he’ll usually just brush me off and say “Oh, that’s just Laura!” which his family is famous for doing. I also know people who went to school with her who can vouch for her crazy and intimidating actions. I’ve told stories to other people about things she’s done to me, with the response usually being, “She DID that? Don’t take up for her, she’s a bitch!” My boyfriend also recently told me that she doesn’t have many friends despite people TRYING to be her friend because she enjoys whining to people about how she’s a loner. 

I wish I could just leave it at “Oh, that’s just her!” but it’s gotten to the point where I can’t, and I’m starting to feel like it’s affecting mine and my boyfriend’s relationship because even just the THOUGHT of having a future that includes her, too, leaves me overwhelmed and sick to my stomach. I know it’s extremely unhealthy for me to feel this way, but I honestly feel FURIOUS even when her name is brought up because I just can’t STAND the thought of her! It’s very apparent that she hates me, and it's also gotten to the point that, despite knowing that the rest of my boyfriend's family loves me, I'm beginning to feel unwelcome around them, too, just because she's over there.

Reddit, I don’t know what to do or how to handle this! How can I get my feelings and emotions under control? I love my boyfriend, but I feel like he’s always taking Laura’s side or just playing off the situation like it’s no big deal, which leaves me feeling hurt. I'm afraid that she WILL get between us, and I just can't stand the thought.

Hi. First off, sorry if this gets a little convoluted!
I've gotten closer in the past year with a girl, Sara. She'll mention how she's lived in another country and her friends from there, and other friends from previous schools who live in our area. I, nor my boyfriend (he is also a good friend of hers and we met through her), nor any of our other mutual friends, have met them. I brushed it off as an inconvenience.
On my facebook news feed one of her statuses popped up, and one of the comments on there was friends she had mentioned. I was very intrigued, and indulged in some creeping. 

It got a little weird.

This friend had a friends list less than 60 (not that unusual, but this is relevant later), despite looking like a very attractive young man. The pictures looked professionally done, and vaguely looked like the same person. In some they aren't even the same people. Looking at the friends list, I quickly spotted some other ""friends"", and all of their accounts had a similar setup: from the area but Sara is the only mutual friend, friends lists never exceeding 50 or 60, professional profile pictures with only a vague resemblance to each other, etc. Plus, in these friends lists, they are only friends with each other, Sara, and throwaway or public accounts that will accept any request they get.
I showed the accounts to my best friend (he is also very close with her) who was immediately suspicious and showed me apparent ""messages"" he had gotten from these friends in the past--who told him that he was being a poor friend to Sara and she deserved better treatment. We've agreed to not show or tell anyone else, but I'm worried my boyfriend will pick up on my change in behaviour.

It's not just that I'm weirded out by these really suspicious accounts, but I've been picking up on her little white lies or inability to back up certain stories when I've asked for details. 
I feel she is lying to me about not just her relationships, but her history in general, and she's even started saying little lies about things my boyfriend and I have said to other people, or vice versa. I'd hate to break off the friendship, but I'm simply not comfortable hearing her say these things that I'm positive are lies.
I have other examples of her pretty outlandish stories outside of these friends, if you want them I'll be happy to provide, it's just this is getting long!

**TL;DR: Seemed to expose a lot of lies a mutual friend has told to boyfriend, me, and many other people. Not sure what to even believe from her anymore, don't want to cut off friendship but super uncomfortable knowing she's lying to me. Want to tell boyfriend but I fear damaging their friendship or building resentment.**",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_1bah5f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1bah5f/my_good_friend_is_probably_lying_to_me_and/,

I'm 22 years old, and I just moved across the country to follow my dream of being a successful musician. To give you background, I tried to do community college but never succeeded; due to me not giving it the proper attention. I have a full-time ""job"" at a retail store, but I know I want so much more from life. I strongly believe every person should follow whatever dreams they have and that the road to success is often littered with many failures. But I really just don't know what I'm doing anymore. I am watching some of my friends graduate, grow up, and I feel like I am here chasing the same things that I have been chasing since I was 13. 

In the same breathe I also feel like if I give up on the idea of being successful in music I will be a failure and that it will haunt me forever. When I hear so many inspirational people talk about their journey, all the sleeping on floors, being lost, I feel like my ""struggles"" are so minor. There are so many variables and it is more stress than I could have ever imagined. My days usually go one of two ways. I'm either incredibly happy to be creating music, finding other musicians, and glad to be taking part in the ""struggle"", or I contemplate the numerous amount of scenarios in which I end up working at a retail chain for life, with no college degree, as someone ""loser"" who is chasing a false hope.

I have never, ever, talked about my personal issues on a public forum. Even doing this frightens me. But Reddit, how should I handle these stresses? Are they normal of young adult life, or is this something I need to sort out now? Should I consider going back home, going to school and giving up? Should I disregard all logic and keep pushing forward?

He's worked here for about a month or two and is the type to feel the need to tell you anything and everything that's on his mind, as though you've asked him, however, he's essentially carrying on a ten-minute conversation with himself. Needless to say, it's rather frustrating. 

I feel like I'm in a bind, though, because he's started hitting on me and is actually incredibly *excited* about me being 18, which creeps me out to no end--I've even emphasized that I have a boyfriend that I'm extremely committed to. What's even worse, is that all he wants to talk about now is sex. When he starts talking about it, there is no WAY that you're going to get him off topic. Last night, his opener to me and my other coworker was, ""One of my friends is a lesbian, and she let me come over before so I could watch her have sex with her girlfriend, and you should have seen--"" We tried interrupting him, changing the subject, giving him extremely obvious hints, but nothing worked! He even resorted to talk OVER us, louder, and when we completely stopped talking to him for the rest of the night, he was STILL talking about it on his own, without any prompts!

Reddit, I feel creeped out. Every encounter with him and his elevator eyes leaves me feeling queasy throughout even the next day, and I honestly don't feel comfortable being alone with him, not to mention even in the same building. 

I don't know how to handle the situation any longer and I also feel like bringing it to a manger's notice wouldn't help in any way, either. What else could I do? How can I solve this?

Here are the basic facts:

1. When I was in college the neighborhood high school girls used to hang out to be around my brothers (twins), but they all got really close to my dad. That's fine. I'm 36, and for some reason high-school girls relate to me as well. I know I'm not a pervert because of it, so I don't presume that he is either just because of that. When my brothers left for the college, the girls still came around. Weird, but still only conjecture.

2. He's REALLY big into computer security. Not in a professional way. He's better than average but not quite a hobbyist in terms of technical knowledge. He's got three computers, and all of them are locked down tight. 
    * 26-character passwords
    * encrypted drives
    * running arch-linux on one and slackware on the others

He doesn't know how to do all of this. He calls me all the time to help him with basic Linux support, but he has his friend, who is a security admin at a big company in the area, do all of the security stuff and OS installation.

3. He definitely doesn't want anyone to know what he's downloading. He clears his browser history at every close, and never leaves a window open when he leaves the computer. He uses various underground download managers. I don't know the names of them as I live in another state and never see any of this, but he sometimes mentions them in passing.

4. His hostname is error. I don't know if that's important, but it seems like an interesting way to spoof some automated checks. I haven't looked into if that's a thing.

All I can do is speculate. I have no evidence, just weird clues.

I know for a fact that he downloads music, and if that's it, I could care less, but that seems like a lot of trouble to go through for music.

I love my father. He was never abusive to my brothers or me. I want to think the best of him, but I can't shake at least the consideration. If he's involved with something like that, I'm more concerned for the victims than my relationship with my dad.

Hello Reddit. Me and my brother carry a burden. My stepdad is a pedophile. Im 20 years old he has been in my life since I was 10. I know he was a pedophile because when I was 15 he tried to molest me on two separate occasions he failed I pulled a knife on him i was a crazy 15 year old he never tried again. He had two daughters with my mom and because of my two little sisters I havent left home. Right now me and my brother of 23 who hasnt left home for the same reason are getting kicked out in two months. I think he is molesting one of my little sisters of 6 years old. Shes exhibiting signs of molestation one of them being that whenever she stays home alone with him she develops a urinary tract infection (me and my brother coordinate so they are almost never left alone with him but sometimes sadly life interferes). My mom gets mad at her for ""holding in her pee to much"" and has never connected the dots. Anyways I dont believe she would do anything if she knew the truth. When I told her about what he did to me she didnt believe me and she denies every incident of when he threatened to kill us the last incident being three years ago. I have a full ride scholarship to the biggest university in my state. The problem is that I would have to move away to take advantage of it. I turn to reddit because there is nobody I can trust with this secret because I have no real proof and no right to separate a man from his children without proof especially because my mom would not back me. Please what are my legal options? Should I leave my scholarship and work full time and raise them with me and my brother? Who can I turn to for help? I feel so helpless.

Until 2 weeks ago, I owned my own small business and besides winters being slow, it was a success. It also allowed freedom and the ability to work with and employ some friends of mine.
Anyways, one morning I see a listing on craigslist for a property manager position on a large estate for a very wealthy family.  Imagining having something safe and steady while my gf was doing the same felt like a good idea. I sen over my résumé, they immediately call me for an interview. It goes great and I get the job. (Good salary but less than I was looking for and no benefits). Excited that I was offered the position so quickly and that It was guaranteed money every week, I took the job. It's now been two weeks. I  am doing things that go so far beyond the job description that was expressed to me in the interview. I have a desk in their basement, I not only manage the entire 10 acres but am also the skilled tradesman (roofer, gutters, mason, electrician, plumber, painter, landscaper, etc etc) and a laborer. The expectations are ridiculous and I expected to be more of a manager than a slave. I'm a hard working person. I always have been. And to top it off, things just aren't clicking for me. I am completing every insane task they have given me (pages upon pages of projects each week) but luck seems to be against me since I started, from sprained ankles, to a car accident, broken phone, huge cuts, ripping pants etc.  I'm in so much pain each night that coughing even hurts my rib cage. To top it off, the family is a group of rude, arrogant, selfish people. When I'm at work I'm miserable, when in home, I'm depressed. I haven't cried in years and have had over 3 breakdowns in the past 4 days.  I could just work slower and do less but I just can't picture myself here at all and being only 2 weeks in, I think it is fair to leave now before I invest anymore time into this and them into me.

EDIT 1: I QUIT! I feel amazing. I spent the afternoon making notes for them and organizing everything to make it an easier transaction for the next caretaker. Then I prepared an email to send to my boss with my official resignation. Before sending it, I called his assistant and explained my reasons for leaving. She actually understood and respected it and added that she was on my team. She complimented me on my work ethic and managerial skills and asked for me to reconsider. I kindly declined considering the situation.

EDIT 2: My boss called me from out of the country on vacation and asked for me to stay and promised to hire a laborer/skilled tradesman to do all the physical work. He also said that we are going to have a meeting and restructure the position to fit my managerial skills that he thinks are a valuable asset.

Can I pursue further action?,7,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1akkib/fired_after_standing_up_for_my_and_my_fellow/,"A bit of back story. I recently moved and took the first job I was offered. It was a poorly managed mom-and-pop shop at a food court. Their son, the manager, hired me as both front and back of house staff and made grumblings about training me to replace the other manager who was due to give birth in October. The owners and their son butt heads a lot. My first two weeks I received nothing but praise. I would walk in to smiling faces, and leave to a chorus of ""you did a good job today!"" Their encouragement and gratitude kept me around despite my desire to find more challenging and dynamic work. Even though they primarily tasked me with easy prep work and dishes, they seemed impressed. Although I was more interested in cooking on the line, preparing the orders was second nature to the other workers and it was more beneficial for me to prep, clean, and restock. Still, they would let me practice when it was less busy.


By the end of two weeks, I was proficient at preparing orders. They had hired a new prep cook. Even though I was decent at cooking on the line, I was still miles behind the others. In my third week, the manager would call me up to help run the front counter since the other workers were quicker at getting orders out. My role became more of a ""floater"", covering for people who were on break.


While working at the counter, I noticed quite a few people would leave tips on their credit card receipts. Occasionally, some would even drop cash into the tip jar. I didn't think much of it, and figured that the tips were pooled since it was never addressed. I was wrong. Come pay day, I received just my wage. I asked the front of house staff if they ever received tips. They said no. I asked the manager about it and he admitted the owners pocketed the tips. I informed him that it is illegal to do that. After a heated discussion, he asked me to bring proof. He agreed it was unfair, but it was his parents' policy and they would need convincing. He assured me he was working on it.


The next day, I arrived at work with Federal Labor Standards Act documents, DOL forms and fact sheets, and a calm tone to explain my case. When I walked in, the owner said he needed to speak to me. He told me I was no longer needed, as I was hired to be a prep cook and they found a better one.


I have no proof that they pocketed the tips, and so I feel filing a complaint to my state's labor department will be fruitless. I also know that I was terminated because I threatened their access to tips, and not because my prep skills were subpar. Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do?

I pushed him away, but I committed the mistake of not telling Samantha right away, I was scared she wouldn't believe me. He told her right after, so she believed him he changed the whole story.

I told her the next day, she didn't care. At all, they only dated for a few months and no feelings were hurt. I was told this by another person, because I have absolutely no memory of this happening, a complete black out. But that was only settled between her and I. The other girls of the ""group"" stared commenting on it, and said it was shitty, I apologized to her and no further issues came. Now 2013 I rarely drink, I work, I study and two nights ago I got drunk but I remember the whole night, no black outs what so ever. I could walk fine, think clearly just buzzed out some whine.

Has cheated on her on numerous occasions and I ask him to call one of my friends please, I explain to him that I'm lost and I dont have a phone and he kind of got to close to my neck. He didn't kiss it but being buzzed I just ignored it and pulled back, and told him just call them(my friends). I wasn't sure of what had happen. I was confused because why the fuck would he try to hit on me. It was weird, when we met with my friends he told her I had done it, and to call Hailey right away, she didn't believe him. She just told him to fuck off. He's called Samantha a liar a thousand times, for catching him with other girls, and telling Hailey. Hailey believes what the bastard told her, Hailey calls me next morining and tells me his boyfriend told her that I wanted to kiss him! I told her what the fuck are you talking about. Reddit my two logical explanations on why he would make this up are:

1. He tried to hit on me saw me buzzed I didn't accept and decided to change the roles and take what I had done in the past as a validation.

2. He doesn't like me as one of hailey's friends and decided that was to way to end a friendship.

An example: in high school I was in orchestra, I was okay but I am not a very musically inclined person. But I tried. They barely showed up to any of my concerts. The one time they did, they bitched me out because I was second violin and in the second row so I was unimportant. I immediately dropped orchestra after they yelled at me for this. There are many more examples I can give. 

Even worse is that I have a sister four years younger than me. She recieved all of the good genes, and I was basically the reject kid, even though I am older. She is incredibly slender, blonde, popular, bubbly, knows how to wear hair and makeup to her advantage. My parents love her. On the other hand, I have dull brown hair, don't know how to wear makeup/style my hair because my mom never showed me how, I wear glasses, I have a dumpy frame, I had severe depression so I was quiet most of the time. 

As soon as I could, I left my parents behind. First to live with my grandma, and now I live with my boyfriend 200 miles away from my family. My parents are very nice and supportive on email or on the phone. But the second I show up to visit them, they tear into me. Criticize me. Call me fat and ugly. I'm the butt of their jokes. They purposefully exlude me from family activities (leaving me at home, not telling me their plans, getting food for everyone except me). I basically drop time and miss work because I miss my family and they treat me like shit.

My sister treats me like shit now too. She joins in with them. She turned 18 and decided to become a stripper (only that, not going to school or anything) she gets drunk and parties and smokes weed every day and my parents think that's totally cool. At the same time, they yell at me for not taking enough credit hours in college (I have a full time job and I take care of my apt/boyfriend/dog so I don't have a lot of time to focus on school, I take as much school as I can, they pay for my school) I had to drop a class because I didn't have time for it and it pushed my graduation date back a semester and they are really pissed about it. They criticize everything about my life.

I can't fucking stand it anymore. They are so awful to me. All I ever wanted was to just be in a family and be a daughter and have a mom and a dad that are proud of me. I try so hard. Last time I visited, they treated me like shit, but when my sister visited, they took a billion pictures of her with them and put it all over facebook and called her beautiful and said they had so much fun with her, etc. 

SO I'm sorry this is a wall of text. TLDR: My parents are assholes. Now THIS is what I need advice on: how should I act around my parents? How should I treat them? I love them so much, but they are awful to me. I honestly don't know which is more mature option:

1) Ignore them when they try to reach out to me. Visit them as little as possible. Basically become a stone wall to them. Cut them out of my life. Give them as little details of my life as possible. For 22 years they have been so awful to me. They don't deserve to be in my life. They can go be a happy family with my sister, and I'll find my own way.

2) Be a fake person. Brush off their insults. Pretend like everything is okay. Be overly cheerful and happy so they feel like they have nothing to insult me over. Pretend that my life is sunshine and daisies so they can't find anything to criticize about me. Act like the perfect daughter even though I hate them, just so I can feel like I am part of the family, even if it is fake. Let them feel like they were successful parents and that I'm happy to see them and talk to them. If it makes them feel better.

I don't know which option would be better for me in the long run. As far as maintaining family relationships go.

When they ask me a question I have to do significant research on what they are referring to, because no one includes any relevant details (e.g. account, contacts, project, dates, times, nothing!)  Sometimes the notes read like a stream of consciousness and I have to dissect what is happening.

1362485826.0,6,self.Advice,19pbij,Life just got forced in an entirely new direction. I have no idea what to do and the wrong choice could send me thousands of miles in the wrong direction.,6,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19pbij/life_just_got_forced_in_an_entirely_new_direction/,"This is going to be a long read and I don't really expect to get many, if any, replies but I just feel like I need help.

I am a British citizen currently in China. I feel deeply in love with a girl that I have never met over two years ago. She is Australian and I have made it my goal to get to her whilst travelling and seeing the world. She lives in a city I have always wanted to live in and the path to getting there happened to be a pretty sweet deal of a 6 month contract in China that ended with free flights on to Australia.

I'm in the sixth month of that contract now, and she ended it with me about 4 weeks ago. Something about space and not being ready... I don't really know, but two days ago I found out that she is seeing somebody else.

The pain I am going through right now is unlike anything I have ever felt. I honestly don't know how I'm going to make it to the end of the month feeling like this. She shouldn't have been, but she was my everything. I really believed that this was it. I had met my soul mate. I know that sounds niave and immature, but for 2 years we have spoken every single night, laughed together, slept on cam together... all that sappy ridiculous stuff that a lot of people laugh at. I loved her. I still do.

I got offered a 6 month extension in China to take on a different job role. The money is minimal, but the life here is free (accommodation, bills etc) and I'll walk away with a few savings. I was originally planning on being in Australia in about 20 days. Now I have no idea what to do.

The magnitude of what it feels like I've lost consumes me every 10 minutes or so and I have to tell my employers in the next couple of days what I'm going to do. I haven't really been happy in China so far, but I think thats because I was working so hard on making this relationship work that I didn't let myself. Now that its over, I just don't know what to do. I can't really come to terms with the fact that it is over.

I have three options as I see it, and none of them sound awesome to me, even though I know there are people who would kill to be in my shoes.

1. Go to Australia now. - there are a number of reasons this idea sits in my head. I could get a job pretty easily, its a western area and I could get to know people fast by just going out and putting myself out there... but its where she is. Its where they are. I don't know if I could cope with that. I told her she would never hear from me again, because I was angry... but how could I not still want to meet her? After everything we have been through... I just want to see her face. I just want things to be what they were supposed to be.

2. Go home. I have friends, good friends at home. They would take me in and ""look after"" me while I went through this. But I know that going home would just mean I'd end up in some crappy minimum wage job living how I used to- miserable and yearning for something more.

3. Stay in China. This is what I'm swaying towards most heavily... but for the life of me I don't know why. I think its just because its where I am now. Its easy to just say ""yes"" and carry on here. I don't really have any friends here and I find most of my days frustrating and lonely. I feel like I could maybe turn staying here into a positive thing- get in shape, learn the language, engage more with my job... but right now, here alone in my apartment, I just don't care. People close to me have stopped ""caring"" as much about me being upset. Obviously I'm supposed to be upset, but now the initial shock and horror has gone from their minds, my continued depression has just become dull to them.

I have never had my heart broken before, I'm thousands of miles away from the nearest person who really loves me, and the only person I really want to be with right now is off fucking someone else.

I feel like I had a good life, and interesting and exciting story going on... and it just got snapped in half in front of me.

I am trying to get back into college, after a five year break. I have applied for the summer semester at a local school, and everything was going swimmingly, until I requested a transcript from a local community college.

My transcript is heavily falsified, there are five classes I never took on there, which I apparently failed, classes I withdrew from in time are marked as failures, and a class that I passed is marked as a failure. The program I want to get into has a minimum GPA requirement, so I am quite screwed.

I immediately raised a fuss, and was told to email records, which I did about a week ago. Records has yet to respond, and my transcript has yet to be delivered to my new school. I contacted my new school and told them I was disputing my old transcript, but I'm not sure this will actually help in admittance.

The last time I was in school was five years ago, and the community college says they only allow disputes for about a year. I have not seen my transcript until last week because after finishing my classes I left school due to disgust at some of their practices.

My transcript is so heavily falsified that I just want the entire thing thrown out, preferably with some writing from the school that knowledges the mistake.

I've always known I have a problem with authority (as a lot of people do), but only recently have I discovered my problem with authority stems from the fact that I hate having to follow someone (whether that person be my boss, or whatever). I hate having someone over me that can dictate all of my actions when it comes to work. They 'own' me, in a way, and it is probably one of the hardest things for me to tolerate.

On the other end of the spectrum, I cannot lead. I guess, if I'm forced to, I can lead a small team in order to get some work done on time, but when it comes down to it, I hate every aspect of it. Like how I hate when someone is over me dictating my actions, I hate dictating other's actions just as much. I feel I am not, and will NEVER be qualified to tell someone else exactly what they should do, in any situation (unless I am a literal expert in that field - but at this point, I would much rather just offer advice than dictate), and I feel the exact same - my boss will NEVER be qualified to dictate my actions - one person should never be the official 'boss' of someone.

These feelings have always been present, but have recently become inflamed due to the fact I am about halfway through my 4-year enlistment in the US military (if you're going to say my attitude is an awful one to have while serving, you're 100% correct, and I am in no way the perfect soldier, and I do not plan to re-enlist. I don't treat my superiors like crap, if that's what you're thinking).

I have no idea why I feel this way, so strongly, because I have never seen this attitude reflected in anyone I have ever met. Maybe other people feel the same way but they keep it bottled up? I doubt it, because I see people that actually want to lead, and it confuses me.

So, here it goes:

I'm faced with a conundrum here. My girlfriend and I live in separate cities, and I travel for months at a time (home for 8 months, traveling for 4 months). This is nothing new for us, we've dated for five years, one of which we spent totally separated when she moved away to pursue her dreams, and then the last three and a half, with me travelling for research. 

When I'm not travelling, we see each each other on the weekend. Not sure if relevant, but somehow I wonder if I we saw each-other every day, things would somehow be better for her.

She can sometimes get into a real funk, and feel really depressed. She will say she has no true friends, feels undervalued by her colleagues, and seems unable to make progress with her goals (her words). This is often intermingled with her expressing extreme dissatisfaction with her self-image. She expresses that she feels overly dependent on her parents for financial support, and this, combined with the other issues, often end (when she is in a funk) in long, spiraling self-denigrating, ever-worsening diatribes, which center around her feelings of inadequacy, desire for more friends, wanting things to work better for her.

I try to provide a supportive ear, and often listen for over an hour, without saying anything more than words that indicate that I am listening. When I travel, this conversation (for days at a time) is our only communication, though I try to add other positive messages, and push things to a more positive direction. But, I feel sometimes that I'm actually enabling this, or that, somehow I am failing her, because no amount of my listening seems to help her feel better. If I try to offer ways to solve specific issues she has (planning to do work, organizing something - not personal issues, but issues which I can actually offer insight) I'm often shut down, and the diatribe continues.

In fact, as is often the case, she will spiral until she is exhausted, and ask for a subject change, which I am unable to provide, because I feel emotionally wrapped up in what she has said, and don't really know how to follow up.

Anyway, last night, it was so bad, I just had to excuse myself in the middle of the diatribe, and go to bed.

I feel like I am missing something obvious here. Other people seem so good at being supportive, and helping, and I typically think of myself in this way, but with my girlfriend, I just feel like I'm utterly failing.

I don't want to present a negative or one sided picture of the situation; I've tried to simply say what I see, and include my emotional reactions.

I recently contacted my biological father.  My mom left him when I was young because he was abusive, and I hadn't seen or spoken to him since (17+ years).  My father and I had a short, awkward, but friendly conversation, and exchanged emails immediately afterwords.  I did not bring up any unpleasant topics and I explicitly told him that he didn't have to talk to me if he didn't want to, and that I was not angry at him.  Our interaction seemed friendly and positive to me, and he seemed happy that I had called.  A few days later he took his own life.   

Needless to say, I am pretty shook up about it.  

I am thinking of trying to talk to his wife (who is not my mother).  She knows I exist, and likely has some through-the-grapevine knowledge about me, but she may not know that I contacted her husband before he died.  

I want to know what role my contacting him had in his death.  Just as much, I want to know who he was (which was why I called him in the first place).  What my own family tells me me about him is that he was smart and talented, but unhappy and dangerous.  I believe my family, but I know there is much more to him than that -- in the years since I last saw him, he re-married (obviously), became a respected member of a community.  

I have good reason to believe that my father's widow would be unwilling to talk to me, but I feel like I have to try.  

I have two questions for you Reddit:

a. How can I make this less hard on his wife?  I can't imagine how awful it would be to lose a spouse, and I don't want to make it worse for her.  Am I being selfish?  Should I just leave her alone?  How can I be kind to her if we do talk?  

b. Should I just drop it?  This feels really important to me, but I am a pretty uneasy about the prospect of contacting her.  I am terrified that she will hurt herself too.  I don't want to damage their family any more than I already have.  

Thanks for your time Reddit.  Even if nobody has any advice at all, writing this has made the situation clearer for me.

Any Advice?,9,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/18emic/im_in_an_online_stalking_situation_with_an/,"Okay, first, some backstory. I'm a 21 year old man, living in Sweden, and I got myself involved with a nice, if a bit awkward, 17 year old English girl online. We chatted 1 on 1 for a few months and Skyped a little, with nothing particularly amiss. After about 5 months, we decided to meet up in real life. I booked myself 10 days in England, expecting nothing out of the ordinary. Boy, was I wrong. She was an absolute nervous wreck in real life, either she'd never shut up or went completely mute while we were in public together. She rocked in her chair and started crying if she was placed into a crowd with too many people. Only when I started asking questions did she tell me she had a fairly invasive form of Aspergers syndrome. My time in England went as well as it could go, and on my way back to Sweden I'd already decided that I wasn't ready for a relationship with someone with such a glaring social disability. When I broke the news to her on Skype when I got back, she started crying and begging for foregiveness for several days straight. I told her that it wasn't her fault and that I'd still like to be friends, but she couldn't accept it. The next few weeks was full of her crying and begging for me to like her as more than just a friend, teary apologies and her spiralling into her own little pit of depression. Eventually I couldn't take it anymore, said my goodbyes, and blocked her on Skype.

She still didn't accept this. This was almost 4 months ago and she still tries to force contact with me. She emails me, tries to add me back on skype, leaves comments on my Youtube profile about how she's changed and just wants to talk to me, hell, she's even been stalking me on World of Warcraft to try and talk with me, asking how I've been, if I have a girlfriend, stuff like that. I've learned from a mutual friend that she's tried to kill herself twice in 3 months, and I'm really not sure what to do with this girl. Any advice?

And things seemed normal, and we occassionally slept together, and whatever. Then I got into a relationship and we were friends, and then he was diagnosed with cancer. I ended up getting pregnant just before he was diagnosed and my bf left me. So 2 months after that we hooked up again, then Aug 2011 he disappeared for about  4 months. Then he messaged me on an aliased facebook (not his real name) and said his email got hacked and he lost his job because too many cancer treatment appointments. He also had to move in with his mom, at the age of 30 ecause he lost his job of 8 years and culdn't afford rent anymore. So then in Jan 2012, we started hanging out again and have been ever since. Now he got called for chemotherapy, 2.5-3 years after being diagnosed, and said he'll be gone for 2 weeks - 4 months, and he can't be contacted and he left one of the biggest cities in the world to go out of province to get treated. He didn't take his laptop, and he said he locked it up. He can't be contacted at all. Then he said he might travel for a few months after that being he couldn't leave his moms house for a year because of a lowered immune system. He couldn't travel at all. He stopped driving and didn't have a cell phone anymore. His email and facebook are not under his real name because apparently he doesn't want co-workers to find him because they know about the cancer. 

Now all of this didn't seem all that weird. Until I googled his name and there were a few articles that he was charged with child pornography. Someone with his name, age and the town he lived in which isn't far from Toronto but about medium sized. I checked how many other people in his town have his name and he's the only one. The police won't help because it would violate his rights. So I don't know. There was talk about getting serious when he gets back, but all this evidence isn't looking good.

She attempted to change the song and instead a homemade recording came on. It was her 'sexy' voice saying, ""My darling sweet..."" 

As soon as she heard it she tried to skip past it and then paused it. She said it was her practicing singing for me and she didn't want to be embarrassed by me hearing it. I honestly believed that was the truth when she said that so I'm trying to unpause it to hear it. She refuses again and even slaps my hands away. 

She has never been embarrassed about singing before so this sits weird with me and I just silently creep out in my seat for a few minutes before I demand to hear it. She agrees, but then tries to stop and pause it again. Finally we are parked outside our apartment and I'm in a full spiral-shaking from the inside out-into a panic attack and she finally plays it. There are two audio recordings of her that she has made for some guy, who she refers to in the recordings only as 'master'. They are of a severe sexual nature. She is telling him that isn't wearing any panties, etc. Whats irks me even more is that the other message is somewhat of a romantic gesture and she is calling to tell him good morning. Needless to say Im freaking the fuck out at this point. We argue and she claims that this was a 1 1/2 week long online affair with some guy she never met in real life. 

She claims the recordings were from 10 months ago, made about a month after her Mom died. She claims that this was a one time act of desperation, and she's never done anything like this before... but that always seems to be what a cheater would say, right?

I have a number of reasons for wanting to do so, both short term and long term. In the short term, I hope to gain discipline and experience with new skills (medical training, combat training, basic knowledge of survival techniques, etc). Another one of my short- and long-term goals is to learn many languages, including Hebrew, Arabic, Spanish, [etc]. In the long term, I hope to gain background and credibility for future endeavors. In 10-20 years from now, I hope to be dealing with issues on an international level (diplomacy, business, etc). 

I believe that the IDF could help me realize some of these goals. I expect that the training and experience gained from being in the military will help me directly meet my short term goals, while setting me up in life with background and credibility to help me accomplish my long term goals. I believe that the IDF in particular would be best for this because I intend to be an advocate for Israel without being afraid to be appropriately critical of its practices. Having served in the IDF I would prove my devotion to Israel, and I would better understand the situation from the soldier’s prospective. However, I don’t want to make a career of the military.

Service in the IDF is a requirement of citizenship in Israel. Every November, the IDF hosts “tryouts” for recruits to test their fitness for certain units. They could provide logistic assistance for me as a “lone soldier” (no family members in Israel). Assuming all goes well, and I make it into the unit that I want, I will have 18 months of training, and then an additional 2½-3 years of army service. It is also relevant that housing and subsequent college would be mostly paid for.  I don’t plan on living in Israel forever. In fact, after school, I plan on moving back to the U.S. for awhile or continue traveling for a few more years (if I have the resources and funds). 

There is no guarantee that I would get into the unit I want, in which case I will be assigned at their discretion. I’m not sure how I feel about that. 

Throughout my life, I want people to know that my support for Israel is not hollow, regardless of how much I criticize its practices. I realize the issues in Israel are for more complicated than I’m making them out to be. There will be people who won’t listen to me or care about what I think, regardless of (or because of) what I will go through.

I used to attend a church, and I was tentatively involved in an all girls youth group. The girls were around 11 years old to around sixteen years old. When a girl turned sixteen, she was allowed to join the Church co ed high school youth group, so the girls group stayed very young. 

The ""leader"" of our group was a kind of ""special"" woman. We'll call her Crystal from here on out. Crystal wasn't exactly normal. She was about forty years old, still lived with her parents, failed out of college four times, and had been in over twenty car accidents. Her parents are wealthy, so they just kept buying her way into college, and getting her new vehicles. It wasn't polite to talk about, so no one really knows what's wrong with Crystal. All we really know is that she's about as mature as a 15 year old girl, and that she has more learning disabilities/social impairments than any of us have fingers.

Crystal would regularly have the girls group at her parents house, and all group related ""fun nights"" were held there as well. (Including movie nights, pool parties, sleepovers, dress up parties, ect.) Crystal, as previously mentioned, lives with her parents. I don't recall ever meeting her mother, but every time there was a girls event, her father would be there. 

Crystals father was socially awkward, and creepy. He consistently said things that were just flat out inappropriate. For example, I was once lamenting to my sister that I looked like a boy. (I was referring to my incredibly short hair.) Crystals father immediately reassured me that I was ""very well endowed"" for my age. I was fourteen when he made this comment. 

Being a young girl, I didn't see him as dangerous. I just saw him as odd, and creepy. The other girls and I sometimes shared stories of the awkward things he said to us, all of them being of a flirtatious nature. I'm not entirely sure why that never raised any red flags for any of us.

*Fast forward six years*.

The girls that I went to girls group with are all grown up and adults. I still keep in contact with three of them, but the others have moved away for college or marriage. 

One of the girls, Carly, receives a facebook message from Crystals father. He talks of how he often ""lusted"" after he when she had her sleepovers. How he wanted to make a move on her, but she was so beautiful he knew that she wouldn't be interested in an old man like him. He spoke of how she used to sit on the couch in the living room and do her homework, and how he wished he were brave enough to approach her. (Keep in mind that Carly was fifteen the last time she went to an event at his house.) At the end of the message, he asks Carly if she would be interested in ""getting together sometime"". Carly is 18, so this message is legal. Nevertheless, he's confessing that he had fantasies about a girl between the ages of 11 and 15 years old. 

Carly shares the email with me, my sister, and a girl named Annie. We all remember times when Crystals father has said inappropriate things to us, but none of us have proof. Furthermore, the majority of our group hasn't been to the church in years. Two of us are known atheists, and the other two had a falling out with church staff. By which, I mean, we could tell the church what we experienced as kids, but they wouldn't really believe us.

We sent a screenshot of the email to them, and a message explaining the situation, anyways. We knew that Crystal still had the girls group meetings at her house, and we felt that underage girls weren't safe there.

Yes, 14 is a little too young to be on reddit, but I usually don't post and stay in ""safe"" subreddits. Your humor on here has helped me through a lot of not-so-good times. This post is a call for help to anyone listening, so thank you guys for being there for me in advance.
Into my story. 
Highschool sucks. Especially when your highschool is filled with cliques and backstabbing, friendships impossible to break into, and, if you try, people talk behind your back and make fun of you for it. I've always been a bit of a loner, the girl who could make friends but can't keep them. When I met Ella, my best friend had left me, and I had no one. As we were both smart and she was alone as well, we became friends quickly. I didn't look farther than skin deep into her character as, after all, one friend is better than none. Ella, I soon learned, was hated by almost everyone in my class. ""She's a b***!"" or ""I hate her!"" was what everyone seemed to tell me about her, and when I would ask why they couldn't explain it. She was nice, REALLY nice, at least to me. I didn't notice anything bad about Ella for about six months. And then it started. Little things, like ""wow that shirt's fugly"" or ""geez don't eat so much"" I could laugh off. But it got worse as time passed. Things like ""No boy would ever ask you out, you're too ugly."" and ""I'd kill myself if I looked like you"" and pointing out if I did anything wrong. It hurt, but I had no one to tell. I laughed it off to stop the pain. But Ella wasn't joking.
""You'd have no friends if you didn't have me.""
""Seriously, Fat ass, loose some weight."" (I'm tall, athletic, and about 120 pounds. Not terrible)
""Your sense of fashion sucks. All your clothes look like garbage.""
""You're the dumbest person in the grade.""
""Dumbass and fatass, that's all you are.""
""Dumbass. You don't even know what that means, you're too dumb.""
""Dumbass. Loser. Fatty. You have no friends.""
""Can you put your hair in front of your face so I don't have to look at your warts (moles) all the time?""
""I can't believe a guy likes you. There's nothing to like.""
""You're so fugly, you make me want to kill myself!""
It started being an everyday thing, my name replaced with ""fugly"" or ""dumbass"". For any tiny mistake, she's right there, the girl I consider my best friend, ready to put me down for anything. It doesn't stop, even when I told her to quit it. 
I have no shoulder to cry on, no other friends, and i don't really get along with my parents. I don't know what to do anymore. If I leave Ella, ill have no one. If I keep being friends with her, the worse my life will get. Please, to anyone out there, if there's any advice you can give, I'd really appreciate it. Please, I feel lost and hurt and dead inside. Even if its just to say tough it out, highschools over in four years.
Thank you.

I've been feeling quite down lately, so I'd appreciate some advice or a pep talk.

I went straight from high school to unskilled work, where I worked various dead end low paid jobs as life passed me by. All my close friends bettered themselves and moved away, while I stagnated in the same small town I was born in. I lost my job in 2010 so I went travelling for 6 months and decided that I needed to get my life in order before it was too late. So I enrolled in a four year college degree at 25 years of age.

The course is quite tough but I'm really enjoying it as for once in my life I'm actually using my brain and feel like I have a purpose. I'm now half way through my third year, so I have 1.5 years left until I finish the degree. The hours are intense and it requires an awful lot of home study so I've very little free time and just about enough money to cover the cost of living frugally and a few beers at the weekend. 

I've been feeling really down lately, I'm 28 years old, have never really had a girlfriend, beyond a few one night stands that led to very short lived relationships. I have no spare cash to do anything so even if I found a girl interested in me who the hell wants to date a broke 28 year old still in college with very little spare time. I'll be 29 and a half when I'm finished. Provided I get the required results in my final year, I'll then have to sign up to a 3-4 year training contract with long hours and many exams. The pay will be low for the first couple of years before increasing in the final year so I'll be 33/34 before I actually have money again. 

I keep telling myself it's going to be worth it in the end but I feel like I'm lying to myself. Ultimately,  what's really getting me down is the loneliness and I can't really see this improving over the next couple of years.

So I went to small arcade inside the theater to think about it.

When I entered the arcade I noticed some random guy and girl standing standing at the end of a Air Hockey Table (AHT). I glanced at the AHT, then started walking back-and-forth at the end AHT I was in thinking about what time I wanted to see the movie, I decided what time. As I was leaving the arcade he called me over. At first I thought he wanted to sell me something. Boy was I wrong.

He called me over. He asked me where I was from, my name, where I worked and where I lived. I stupidly told him. Because again, I thought he was some kind of salesmen and was gathering data. I thought this because I noticed some medicine bottles on the AHT. Then things got scary.

He basically got in my face and violently told me how I disrespected them by looking at his girl, how he doesn't care about cameras or security and the only reason he doesn't do anything is out of respect for his girl. But he would remember how I looked like and would tell him homies to come find so they would take care of me.

I tried apologizing, but he would tell just tell me to be quiet. This went on for what felt like an eternity.

At this point I was very scared. I honestly didn't look at them. And I started wondering why no one was helping me. Then he said something, otherwise I don't know what would of happened. He told me his mom was killed. Then I noticed he eyes where almost going to become watery. I knew this was my only chance to get out of it.

I told him how I lost my father. Then he started crying about the hurt and how it felt. Next thing I knew we where crying in each others arms. Luckily for me, if I can cry a little, I know I can make it so that I baaw my eyes out.

As we where baawing in each others arms. He was saying right in my ear how my dad is always looking out for me, how he was always watching me. Then he asked me if my dad would take me to the movies.

He took out his wallet asking if I was going to see a movie. I put my hand up saying ""no thank you"". But he told me that now wasn't the time to show pride.

He wanted to give me his phone number and email address. Because apparently he wanted to be a father figure. And his number was so that he could ""back me up"" whenever I needed him.

He wanted to go for a walk with him, but I declined. I started walking away and told him I had a lot to think about. Then I just walked straight home w/o looking back. Though I'm pretty sure he didn't follow me home.

And how here I am. Still shaken up over what happened. I went from strong sense of fear, then sadness, to ""wtf happened?"".

He was probably on some kind of drug / high. He told his girl was going to be a mother, so maybe he had bottled up emotions and decided to let them out on me? I dunno.

My [F20] boyfriend [M21] has a paranoid schizophrenic and manic mother. He only recently learned (about 2-3 months ago) that she was actually diagnosed with this before, but he has always known there was something not right with her. He also learned that she was actually institutionalized for 3 months too, but at the time his father told him she was ""visiting family"". The thing is, his mother is NOT taking any of her medications or seeing a doctor and she has been violent. She has verbally and physically hurt my boyfriend and his father and has also tried to kill herself. She does not work, refuses to work, and does not leave the house, so she sits alone at home all day on facebook. I have been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half and have seen her do some crazy shit. She has broken down doors in the house when she's angry, stabbed his father in the arm with a knife, hit my boyfriend, told him she hated him, told him he was a waste of life, etc. She chased his father down the highway trying to get into a car accident with him because she thought he was cheating on her then followed him to a meeting and watched him through the window and eventually went inside the restaurant where the meeting was held and sat at a nearby table and drank wine till he left. She then withdrew all the money from their bank account and didn't show up at the house till around midnight, got into an argument with my boyfriend's father, and bit him to the point where he bled, then she called the cops and fled, didn't come back till the next morning. Then she went on as if nothing happened. For Thanksgiving she took her husband's phone and broke it because she went through his texts and found out that the family was trying to get her help. A couple of days later my boyfriend found her on his father's facebook pretending to be him messaging his female coworkers asking them to have sex with him. This could get his father in so much trouble if these women were to say he was sexually harassing them, he could lose his job (he is the only one who works, the mother quit her part time job over a year ago because she was ""too sick to work"" so now she gets disability checks). She then got her car impounded and my boyfriend gave her all of his savings to get it back for it to just sit in the garage because she only leaves the house once every 2-3 months. Next, his father and her got into an argument where she says he ""admitted"" to cheating on her with a ""20 year old"" and then he ""punched"" her in the jaw. Now, I know his father would NEVER lay a hand on her or ANY woman. The next day my boyfriend's sister [F30], who hasn't lived at home since she was 18 and who isn't even blood related to ANY of them, called him up and told him he needs to help their mom out because she's ""dying"" and that he needs to get his mother an apartment and pay for her bills. My boyfriend can barely pay for his car payment, insurance, and gas and just gave his mom a little over $1,800. Then she yells at him for not sticking up for his mom against his dad. 
I don't know WHAT to do...I mean, there's not really much I CAN do, I'm an outsider here. My boyfriend doesn't know what to to either..He says his family doesn't have the money to put her in a hospital and says she won't go see a doctor. It's putting a strain on our relationship because I want to help him, his father, and his mother, but I don't know how. His mother sits at home all day everyday stuck in her own mind, thinking thoughts she can't control. I know she's suffering, but I know there has to be something my boyfriend or I can do, right? I feel so bad for her, I really do, but at the same time I don't understand why she refuses to help herself when she KNOWS she has a problem. Sometimes I feel like she thinks ""If I can't be happy, no one can.""
Is there anything I can do?

TL;DR
My boyfriend's mother is a Paranoid Schizophrenic that has become violent and his family is not doing anything to help her. Any ideas?

About 2 months ago, I ordered a pizza, which arrived late by more than 35mins past the expected delivery time and didn't have chicken when I requested double chicken. At the door, I had a huge argument with the delivery guy and I spoke to the store manager and threatened not to buy from them again and they ended up saying ""keep this pizza. We will not charge you anything"" and I did, but I've never ordered by phone again to that address for fear of what I think may have happened today. Fast forward a few weeks, I went to the store which is just around from my work and I ordered a pizza and had it inside the store. As I'm about to leave the store, the driver I had the argument with is about to come in and he looks at me, recognizes me and puts sort of an evil grin and continues walking. So today I went there again and ordered the usual pizza and I a slice and underneath the tomato there is this gooey substance all over the base of the pizza. The taste is not clear, but the texture that stays in the mouth is very very similar to sperm (Don't ask.)

Now, I don't know if I am being overly paranoid, but the pizzas I order are always very simple (I never change): no cheese, onion, pineapple and double-chicken and I can tell the taste and texture today could very easily be misguided by cum. I've kept the remaining slices of the pizza and I'm sort of curious to know if there is anything I can do to confirm if there was any substance in my pizza that shouldn't be there and if so how/where. In fairness, the situation is a bit complicated as I don't want to speak to anyone of my family/friends that I may have tasted someone else's sperm, as it'd be awkward to explain how I know the texture. I also don't know what type of laboratory would be able to assist me in finding out if my fears are right (if this is possible at all). 

In other words, if I were to search for a lab to have the leftover pizza tested for sperm, what type of lab and price would I expect to be charged for this?

I'm 27 and for a couple years now I've been my grandmother's caretaker. The woman raised me, and I love her to death, so I'm here for her in her twilight years, performing tasks around the house that she can't and driving her around town.

But our biggest problems come when my parents (mother and stepfather) make appearances in our lives. When they do it's almost always to ask for something, usually money, because they're bums living out of hotels with their fellow drug-addled friends and they manage the welfare money they receive with all the grace of a toddler. They'll spend money on frivolities when they haven't paid their rent. My stepfather has a chronic gambling problem and frequently disappears to the casino with all their money. They used to have a dog and cat, and we're now stuck caring for both.

So when they get in a fix, my mother calls up and wails to her mother (my grandmother) and begs for money. These calls typically involve screaming, crying, and full on tantrums from the obese 50-year-old woman she is. When I try to intervene, my grandmother accuses me of being heartless and my mother accuses me of ingratitude (which is hilarious since her only contribution to my rearing was giving birth to me). Ultimately when she does lend them money, she never gets it back and winds up regretting it because she barely has enough money to live on herself. But then a month or so passes and the cycle begins anew.

I want these people out of my life, as permanently as possible. They're leeches, financially and emotionally, and their selfish dramatic displays are taxing on my grandmother's health. I'm just afraid that taking action will only either stress her worse or cause her to hate me.

There was a lot of drinking and there were a lot of minors at this party, including a few 17-year-old college students. A student that I had been a camp counselor for goes to this particular university now and she is 17; she knew that I was going to be in town and asked if we could hang out, so I invited her to the party. Long story short, she arrived blacked out and drank too much at the party that I was at (I gave her some of the drinks, but not all of them) and wound up at the hospital with a 0.37 BAC. She had to talk to the administration at her college about this incident and named the house owner as the person who invited her and pressured her to drink/gave her drinks. 

This guy that she blamed is employed through the college and the organization that he is employed through is under administrative investigation because of an incident that happened before his employment began, however, he has been in a little spotty trouble with the admin before over small things, mostly related to underaged drinking happening on his watch. They basically told him today that they are going to assume that he is responsible for this incident and terminate his employment unless the truly responsible party is revealed (they think that he's covering for someone but also they have been using him as scapegoat because of his record). 

I don't know what to do. I am much more responsible than him for all of this and my employment is not on the line. I find it wrong and unjust that they are blaming him for something for which he isn't really responsible. I have given my contact information to his boss and asked his boss to share this information with the administration and he told me that they would be in contact tomorrow (the guy told me that his boss would be the best avenue to get the admin my contact info). 

What is the best way to approach my conversation with the admin? What is the worst case scenario? How will my punishment change as a result of this girl being 17 instead of a legal adult? This guy who is being stuck with the blame right now refuses to incriminate anyone even at the expense of his own job and lifestyle and I want to protect him from this wrongful blame. How can I do this best? I really need some advice.

**TLDR**: A friend is being blamed for something that is my fault and now his employer is threatening to terminate his contract. I am intervening tomorrow but don't really know the best way to intervene.

**UPDATE**: I talked to the administration today and they said that they were withdrawing a recommendation for punishment against the guy whose house the party was at. The admin guy thanked me for coming forward and claiming responsibility and said that I should be more careful to not drink with minors in the future but that everyone is just glad that the drunk girl survived and they will be closing the investigation before Thanksgiving.

I am 23 and quite successful in the material and academic senses, upon finishing up at university I had a host of offers and picked my dream job.

I had a horrible upbringing my parents didn't even try to act as if they particularly cared about me, I also grew up in a very remote area and was not given permission to have visitors and was strongly discouraged not to go over to my friends houses even though I occasionally did.

I was never bullied in school, I think the other kids felt sorry for me. My father did bully me and I suppose in effect controlled my life up until now. Obviously this isolation and treatment has severely tainted my character. 

I am not really considered weird or mentally unwell, I come across as incredibly distant, quiet and anxious. There are some people who I feel comfortable around but these are few and far between. I don't think anyone realises that I'm depressed or the degree of my anxieties.

I have not been in a nightclub for 2 years and my 'friends' don't even invite me anymore, not that I really have any proper friends left. In university I completely focused on getting good grades so I could escape home. Indeed this over the past two years I would struggle to think of even 5 fun or cool experiences/days/activities I have had. I became outrageously depressed but had hoped this would all end when I eventually escaped, but I have isolated myself too much.

I don't think I can ever remember initiating any conversation with a girl, and the degree of my inexperienced would be to the level of never even having held a girls hand. I am by no means unattractive, in fact I was even approached about being a male model on holidays in my late teens, and despite my fears and isolation I have generally gone through life with a few offers on the cards, but I have always been too frightened to even consider them.

I guess the fear I have of intimacy might be related to my upbringing? I was never hugged and my parents were not affectionate even to eachother. I also had no sisters or even female friends so no real experience of women.

It is really frustrating as I am missing everything that I want to experience and I feel the peak of my existence is being utterly wasted.

I had been drinking a little that night, though as DD the only drink I had was when I arrived home. 

As I finally felt myself drifting off to sleep, I heard a few people shouting outside.

*fucking drunk people* was all I thought

the voices grew in number and intensity. It sounded like a fight. A large, disturbing noise overpowered everything else. In my medicated stupor it took me longer to realize it was gunfire than I'm proud of. 

I was at my bathroom window; I live on the top floor of a townhouse, facing the street. My bathroom is on the right side, and more towards the back. The window gave me a perfect view of the situation.

A large crowd gathered around a single person, and everyone was screaming. This man had his arm raised, and I noticed he was holding a gun (pistol?) when the light reflected off of it. It was chrome silver. It was really fucking big.

I don't know why no one ran. The gunman had apparently shot into the air, but pointed his gun at the section of the crowd in front of him. I don't know why no one ran. It looked like a man was getting held, but this is just my own conjecture. someone tried to jump the gunman. Two shots came from the gun. 

People dispersed in waves. The first group seemed to be the gunman and people around the victim. They scattered quickly. A few ran past my house. Some ran up the street. They were shouting. 

The second group seemed to be the victim and his friends. He was brought to the hospital, or so my school informational email says, and is in critical condition.

The last group were the looky loos. few stayed to talk to police, several were too inebriated to function, and they were hauled away in a squad car. 

That's all I could manage to stay awake for. I slept all day, and when I woke up, I drank another double dose of nyquil and melatonin so I wouldn't have to think about it. 

I'm not sleeping very well tonight, either.

**that's the end of the account, here are my questions**

1) I don't think I'm anything close to a credible witness. My roommate informed me that police have sent out a hotline for tips, and that they have no suspects, arrests, or information on the event. I left my information on a policeman's voicemail. **if the call is returned, should I clarify that I am not a credible witness beforehand?**

2) After replaying the event again and again in my head, I've begun to suspect this was a gang shooting. If so, this would explain the lack of witnesses. **is it worth talking to police about this? Am I making myself a target by stepping forward as a witness?**

3) Someone got fucking shot not 200 feet from my house. This is my first experience with this kind of thing. This was a good neighborhood. Now that I'm awake, I can't think about anything but the shooting. I have a test in 8 hours, and projects due this week. I don't know how to function beyond this.

Once I blew my top over this, he immediately did everything, but I can't understand why he needs me to blow before doing this kind of stuff, and it's happening everyday lately! I mean he said he would do the grocery shopping today and he came home with sweet potatoes and cat food! That's it! I had to lock myself in my room to keep from erupting like a volcano! I'm still sick and when I yell I feel like I get sicker, and I've been yelling everyday for the past two weeks and not getting any better. I don't know what else to do.  



Edit:
 Thank you for all the helpful suggestions. I think I came up with a good plan now that will make it easier for me to ignore him when I need to and put him in situations where I can praise him more often. I'm going to let him be in charge of the groceries and dinner from now on. This will lighten my workload (leaving me less stressed), and when he messes up he will figure it out for himself (I won't need to say anything), and when he does it right I can tell him how great he is. I'm prepared mentally now to ignore it if he totally blows it, and I don't mind eating cereal for dinner if that's what it comes to. This won't solve all the problems, but I think it will be a good place to build from. I'm so happy to have a plan I feel hopeful about.

I just started a new job this week and I'm loving it. It's interesting and so far, the boss has been great.

Today, she invited me out to lunch. When the bill came, the other coworker gave her enough money for his meal and the tip. Since she had offered to pay for me, she just paid with her card and kept his cash. Once the card was scanned, she put a big slash through the space for tip and wrote in the original amount. Since she paid the bill with her card, there was no tip.

I didn't know what to do. I worried it would be like going over my boss's head to leave a tip, so we ended up leaving nothing, which is so rude. I'm thinking of going back to the restaurant on Monday to give a tip, but what if this happens again? Do I just leave cash on the table and say something? What if we're in a larger group? What if it's just me and her?

1351212412.0,6,self.Advice,123juk,"I had a great conversation with someone I think I could be good friends with, but I'm bad at making the leap from random person to friend. Also, I don't want to appear to be hitting on her (I'm married, she's engaged), and the next time I'm likely to run into her again (if ever) is months away.",6,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/123juk/i_had_a_great_conversation_with_someone_i_think_i/,"tl;dr: I want to have another conversation with the woman who cut my hair the other day to see if we might be friend material, but don't know how to approach her un-creepily other than waiting 3 or 4 months until I need another haircut.

Back story: I moved to this city about 2 years ago to be with my wife after being in a long distance relationship with her for many years. My friends and family are all 500+ miles away, which doesn't bother me for the most part. I keep in touch with them online, and being an introvert I was never really the type who needed a lot of regular, face to face contact with them anyway.

The problem is, because I'm an introvert who also doesn't drink or smoke or party or do most of the things that one tends to meet other people doing, I haven't really made any new friends since I've moved here. My wife (who is also kind of an introvert, though less so than me) has a few friends that I've spent some time with, and we have some ""couple friends"" we hang out with together, but they're not really the type of people I'd normally choose to be friends with on my own.

So the other day, my wife and I went to get hair cuts at the local beauty school (my wife is somewhat frugal, and I'm a guy and don't really give a crap about what my hair looks like). Normally getting my hair cut is an unpleasant experience for me - aside from the fact that it brings up memories of getting stabbed and cut with scissors a number of times during hair cuts when I was a child, I usually wind up dreading the conversation part of the experience.

I'm not good at small talk, and I'm not good at conversing with new people (I have a sense of humor that some people find off-putting, so I tend to either shut it off completely and become uninteresting or weird people out when I don't). I know I don't have to converse with the person cutting my hair, but I usually wind up trying to do so, because I worry that I'm being rude otherwise.

This time, though, the woman who was cutting my hair (who we'll call ""Sarah"", though that's not her name) and I seemed to hit it off really well. We were chatting the entire time she was working on my hair (which took over an hour, if not closer to two), making jokes and talking about similar interests and our differences (we come from somewhat different backgrounds, which I always find interesting). She had a great sense of humor and I found myself laughing a lot, and she seemed to appreciate my sense of humor, too.

It's possible that she's like that with everyone and it's also possible that her laughter was polite (though it seemed genuine to me), but I'm not like that with most people, and I was sort of stunned by how easily our conversation flowed. It felt to me like I was talking to one of my friends that I've known for years rather than someone I'd just met. My wife, who was sitting two chairs down from us, even commented to the woman cutting her hair that I don't usually like talking to people in general, let alone as much as Sarah and I were talking.

I love my wife, and Sarah is engaged, so this really is nothing more than I had a great conversation with her and I think I'd like to talk to her again sometime to see if there's a potential for friendship. My wife's hair cut finished faster than mine did, so she joined our conversation for the last 20 minutes or so, and she liked Sarah too and could see that we seemed to get along really well. My wife and I talked about my lack of local friends last night, and this afternoon she told me that she had considered stopping by the beauty school earlier today to talk to Sarah herself and invite her and her fiance over sometime, but she wasn't sure how I'd feel about it and decided against doing so until checking with me first.

But we're both kind of socially awkward and neither one of us knows if this is just a completely idiotic thing to be even thinking about, let alone actually doing something about. The truth is, I don't know if this was just a fluke (I do occasionally have days when I'm more ""on"" than others), or if she just happens to be the type of person who can not only talk to anyone, but anyone can talk to, as well, despite my usual conversational ineptitude.

I also realize that one good conversation isn't necessarily a clear indication of how well two people will get along, and that it's possible that there's some deep, dark secret hidden underneath that might be a deal breaker - for all I know she could murder puppies in her free time. But I'll never know if she's a puppy killer unless I get to know her better - or unless she gets caught and makes the local news, I guess.

I suppose my question is this - is there something either I or my wife could or even should do? Other than trying to make friends elsewhere? Is it really stupid to be thinking about trying to befriend someone who probably doesn't even remember our conversation out of all the customers she dealt with throughout her day?",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_123juk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/123juk/i_had_a_great_conversation_with_someone_i_think_i/,

Sure having it stolen was frustrating beyond belief, but right now I don't know how I feel and it's the first time I've had my life threatened, especially with a revolver as big as his. I have a couple questions for you guys:

1. I have the IMEI # and Serial # for the 4S which I turned in to the police, Is there any slim possibility that the police can trace it so they can catch the guy? (I called police RIGHT after this happened btw)

2. He also called me from his cell phone (he definitely seemed stupid, the typical 'gangster with a gun' idiot who doesn't seem to have an IQ of greater than 5), I traced the number but only managed to get the company which would be AT&amp;T, do you know if they would release his billing information/name/anything else to the police if they request it?

3. Most importantly, how can I deal with the trauma? I'm honestly so confused right now and all I could think of the whole time was 'how would my family be able to deal with this if I had really gone' because I live 90 miles away for college. I'm feeling a blend of confusion, freight, depression, I just don't really know. 

Thanks in advance Reddit members, sorry to seem to 'fragile' but in all honesty I never thought I'd have to deal with this. Before anyone asks, this happened through a Craigslist transaction, and before anyone jumps to the assumption that 'it's stupid to meet someone in private or something', I didn't, I met him at a church and he sounded very mature on the phone, so I definitely did not see it coming.

I am questioning whether I should even offer a return to him anymore, but since I already said I did, I am possibly bound to by Paypal's terms. I am not sure. What would you guys do in this situation?

**From the buyer:**
Good morning  as I explained I was able to pick up my package at the post office before I left on vacation.  Late yesterday I was able to a activate the phone before I left on my business trip.    While leaving home I noticed the phone would go from 1 bar of service to full 3G to two bars and on and on.  The battery which was fully charged was depleted fairly quickly.  Of course I have verified all settings, both manually and with Verizon.  My wife who is traveling with me has an IPhone and didn't experience any of these issues with reception in the same areas when I began to monitor the situation.  Phone is in the same condition as delivered.  Never dropped or abused once in service.

I'm in Alabama, a large city until Monday  no spare phone.  I would like to know what you want to do?  I can do any of the these or anything reasonable.

1. Return for refund
2. Credit my paypal for a portion of the sale- I will use insurance to replace
3. File a dispute with Paypal

I look forward to hearing from you  thanks

**My response**

Hi XXXX,

I am very sorry that the phone is giving you such issues. With the
battery, I should have made a note to you that it is a literally brand
new battery, and would probably require several cycles of
charge/discharge before it fully works. I am not sure why there are
reception issues. It may be a local tower issue, or how each phone
reports its number of bars. I wouldn't know for sure as I am not a
Verizon expert.

Regardless of all this, I don't want a buyer to be unsatisfied with
his purchase. Although I explicitly stated that there would be ""no
refunds"", I am open to making some sort of exception.

I can refund the sale price minus the seller fees I paid ($24.50) plus
the added insurance and packaging I paid out of pocket ($10). This is
provided I receive the items back and they are in the same condition
as when I sent them out beforehand. If you would like to do the
refund, I would ask that you please send the items back asap, since
the value of the phone will depreciate as more people move to 4G.

I am also willing to credit your paypal $40 instead of having you
return the items if you wish, just to save me trouble as well.

Thank you and let me know how you would like to proceed.

**His response**

Thank you for your timely response.  I am unwilling to take that kind of loss, $34 dollars for something that doesn't work.  I will file a dispute with Paypal and move the issue along from there.

**Him again, 1 hour later**

Hello  did you get my follow up response?  Would like to move this forward  thanks

**And yet, him AGAIN**

Hello-
I have contacted Paypal and they are insistant that you and I have some dialouge before I open a case.  While you are open to a refund, I dont feel on my end that I should pay you, pay shipping and then pay shipping back to you for a refund.

I want to be adult and professional about this matter.  I am additionally frustrated that this is all taking place on my vacation.  I would send you the phone today, however I have no replacement phone.

I will mail the phone to you ASAP in the original condition you sent it in.  I believe at home I have the plastic that I originally removed.  My offer would be this.

I will pay to ship it back, USPS Priority with Delivery confirmaton.  You would agree to credit me the purchase minus $20 bucks and you can re-sell the phone or what have you.

Please let me know if you argree so I can get this going.  Thank you again.

**My response**

Hi XXXX,

I was not under the impression that you were going to be continuing to use the phone for an extended period of time. The battery and case are no longer ""new"" as the items were listed and shipped to you. I am sorry that you are not satisfied with the phone even though it arrived in the condition that it was listed, and you have been using for several days now with the intention of using it throughout the weekend in addition.

Despite the contract also being ""no refunds"", I am willing to work something out as previously described. If you could please package the items as they were sent to you first thing Monday when you return from vacation, and have them arrive to me no later than within 10 days of the sale, we can minimize depreciation to market value of the phone.

In return I will refund you the original sale price minus the ebay and paypal fees ($24.50), packaging and USPS insurance ($10). This is after I can verify that the items are in the condition they were sent.

Thank you

**His response**

I will package up 
Monday afternoon when I return and send them back to USPS mail with delivery confirmation thank you  I will post positive feedback when I receive the refund and ask you do the same

**AND THEN, yet again, him 1 hr later**

Good morning  I just stopped at a cellular store hear in mobile  they will trade e a refurbished phone for 100 bucks  would you be willing to split that cost with me and then we can end this happily  I saw in one other communication you mentioned a paypal cash refund I just didn't know the amount  I have not been carrying or using the phone in order to preserve the condition  this option may suit us both the best  let me knw

**WTF???**

**UPDATE: My response**

Hi XXXX,

I thought an agreement had been made but you have continued to renegotiate and change the terms. I am very uneasy about what your motives are now in this transaction. You have already verified that the phone is functional and you have been using it. You have also registered the ESN with Verizon which means I am no longer in fact the owner of this device, but you are. Because of this, I am hesitant to receive this device back from you and attempt to resell it while you are now the owner. I am also uneasy with the repeated requests for me to paypal you a portion of money.

The terms of the sale were ""no refunds"". You have received and signed for a fully operational phone with a new battery and case, both of which are genuine HTC parts. I have tried to work with you in a reasonable fashion to resolve this issue, but I am no longer comfortable with where it is going.

I would ask that you keep the phone and do with it what you wish. You can sell it, as you proposed, or continue to use it, since you have confirmed that it does in fact, work.

If you are unsatisfied with this then you have every right to proceed as you wish and I will provide the necessary proof and documents to Ebay and Paypal.

Once again I apologize, but I am no longer comfortable with a return.

Thank you,

It was not bad actually, lol. This girl however, was quiet the problem in my life. She cheated on me once, I broke up with her and took her back on when she dogged me for about a month.

Sure enough some herb that I keep in said freezer seems to be getting smaller in quantity every time this occurs.

He is now telling me there have been 'complaints' against me by other residents in my building and might have to start doing 'random unit inspections'. I live in Ontario. This does not seem legal.

I want to approach the property owner about this. I assume any formal complaint would need to reach him in writing (rather than being word of mouth from his building maintenance guy) and would like to find out if there are actually documented complaints against me.

Whats the best way of handling this so I:

a) Am diplomatic in case there IS a legitimate complaint of some kind against me
b) Ensure 'random unit inspections' do not occur.

I am extremely happy to be where I am, and to be finally doing what I love. Not everything is going great, unfortunately. 

This summer, before attending my new uni, I was looking for a roommate, and began talking with several different people about potentially sharing an apartment/townhouse with them. I spoke with each of them for over a week before deciding who I wanted to room with. Once deciding, my future roommate and I talked for almost two months nearly every day, getting to know each other. He seemed like a cool guy with very similar opinions and interests. 

However, almost immediately after we moved in together, things started to go downhill. He wasn't the way he had acted when we'd spoken online/over the phone, or the way that he had told me he was. He turns every little thing into a full-blown argument, and refuses to ever accept responsibility for the smallest things. He bitches about the littlest things all the time. He never does his fair share of the housework, constantly leaving out his dirty clothes/plates/trash, etc for days. He is constantly one-upping everyone, yet rarely can back up his claims. If he disagrees with anything someone says/states, he gets an *extremely* harsh and/or condescending tone and begins to curse at you and act like you're an idiot, simply for holding different views; if you end up proving him wrong, he either just tells you to ""shut the fuck up"" or refuses to believe it altogether. Frankly, he's just arrogant, selfish, whiny, and closed-minded.  

I am an extremely introverted person, so I simply can't deal with this all the time. I have spoken with him multiple times about the issues that I have with him. To his credit, every time I do, he does apologize and promise to try and work on it, but it goes right back to the way it was the following day. I realize that I am not perfect, either, but I have tried to make concessions and work with him, because I know it can be tough to be around another person pretty much 24/7, but the give has to go both ways.

I realize this is largely just me bitching, but I needed to vent. I don't really have any friends at my new uni yet, so I can't talk to them, and I don't want to worry my parents. So, to Reddit I went. Thank you to those who read this, and to those who will offer advice. 

**My question is: What should I do? 
Should I just cut ties, and let him know I will be his roommate, sharing the apartment, but nothing more?** 

**Should I just suck it up until our lease ends (not for another 10~ months), and then move out? The problem with this option is that we split furniture in the common areas 50/50. Probably a poor decision, but I thought he was going to be a great roommate.**

Significant background:

* I've worked at my company for almost 10 years. Last year I applied for a promotion at a store 2 miles from my house. Got the promo, and was never trained for the position. Tried my hardest to learn ""on the job"" but there's a lot of SOP that gets really intricate, especially in my position, and I don't know all of the answers.

* I have an assistant who is also brand new to the job, from another department, also untrained. I was brought on, and one of my tasks was to get her trained to take over a position on my level within 6months. 

* I have worked for almost 7 out of the past 13 months without an immediate superior who, in most similar stores' cases, is there to train, help, direct, delegate etc. Someone had filled the position in February, but she works in our corporate offices 2 days (soon to be 3) out of every week. In my job performance failings (mentioned below) I had constantly asked her for help in how to improve, to which she shrugged her shoulders numerous times. 

* Two weeks ago, (7/16) my district manager pulled me into his office to tell me that my performance (specifically my quantifiable performance indicators) had not been where it should be, and that he would give me the option of: transferring me to a smaller store, offering me a voluntary demotion, or transferring me to a store 1.5 hours away from my house. 

* This was the first time I had been sat down and told of my myriad shortcomings. I had no idea that this type of conversation was on the horizon. Admittedly I knew I was falling short in some areas, because I didn't have the knowledge or experience to handle the majority of situations I experienced exclusively to this position, but in no way did I think that this lack of training would ever result in a performance-based transfer. I had requested formal training some half-dozen times over the past year, though it was never granted me due to payroll constraints. 

* (7/23) In our next meeting, I told him that I refused to move stores, as my poor performance was directly related to a lack of training for the position to which I was promoted. He said that refusal was not an option. I said that I refused to concede failure, as I am very hardworking, dedicated, and ready to take on the job (in my current store) with the fine-tuning that I need to succeed and otherwise I would be set up for failure. I indicated that if the company did not see fit to accommodate these requests, they would have to fire me.
* At this point, my DM said that as a salaried associate, I didn't have a choice, and that since I refused to move, they would be firing me later in the week. 

* Friday 7/26 at 4pm I still hadn't heard anything, so I sent an e-mail to my Regional VP asking for clarification on my situation. He was unable to advise me. All that he said was that my director of HR would be coming out this coming Monday (8/5) to sit down with me. I'm still not sure what that means. 

* Since all of this has transpired, I no longer feel any attachment for this company. I have already moved my wedding date twice, and prolonged graduation from college as a result of the endless hours I put in trying to do what is best for the store. The day that my DM told me I would be fired later in the week, I registered for college full time, and started looking for internships. Now it sounds like the company higher-ups are backpedaling. I feel that my DM spoke out of turn when he told me I would be fired. I have no intention of quitting (I want to collect unemployment until I find another job/internship, and to do this I must be fired) Now I worry that in my meeting with HR on Monday, they will say that they are not going to fire me, even though my subsequent actions were entirely based on taking my District Manager at face value, and acting as a person whose job was no longer viable. 

* P.S. All conversations (with the exception of the first one--I was totally blindsided by it) have been recorded in accordance with NYS wiretapping/recorded conversation law. 

* Do I have a case to demand termination? I have already made plans for myself with the understanding that I was effectively fired. I have worked too long and too hard to kowtow to a company that so clearly sees me as expendable after almost a decade of dedicated service. I now feel it is time to get my life in order, and in doing so, I would like to know if I will be able to receive unemployment assistance until such time as I am able to find appropriate work.

So, this summer, I went abroad for two months to a country that didn't have very good access to phone/internet.  I talked with my girlfriend ""Abby"" as much as I could and things seemed alright.  But, she went to a religious camp for a month, she left two weeks before I got back to the USA and will be gone for another two weeks in total.

At her camp, she doesn't get to use her cellphone much and even when she does she doesn't get very reliable service.  We spoke one night, and I expressed that I was just worried about the fact that we've been apart for so long and that it's difficult (oh yeah, we have a long distance relationship even in the states.  Our schools are about 3 hours away and our hometowns are about 5) to be in a long distance relationship.

I was planning on going to see her for about a week before I went to college but now she's telling me that she doesn't want to see me, and a whole bunch of things.  It's a complete 180 from how she normally is, maybe it has something to do with her Religious camp, I don't know.

I'm scared that all of a sudden she'll be different, or I'll be different, and things wont work out, and we'll just end our relationship.  I don't know what to do.

I feel like my life went downhill after high school graduation. Throughout grade 10 and 11 I was a nobody, but then I lost a bunch of weight. People found me attractive, and all of the sudden I had a taste of the good life. I was somewhat popular.
A couple months after graduation my girlfriend broke up with me. I went to the community college in the small city I grew up in and my grades were awesome. Then my family moved, and I moved with them. I am now going to a much more difficult college, but it is also less well respected within my new city.

A few people I was friends with from my old city (population of about 100,000) live here, but it is so difficult to organize anything here (population of over 1,000,000). This is especially prevalent in social drinking, because my parents live pretty far away from downtown. 

I have almost no serious college friends, I would only consider the people I met in my first year as acquaintances. The media playing up college as something that's supposed to be the best time of your life makes things even more intolerable, because I feel like I'm doing something horribly wrong. 

When I look at how my life is now in college, and my lack of a meaningful social life like I had in high school, it makes me regret a lot of my decisions that I have made in my teenage years. It also makes me miss my ex girlfriend, which I definitely shouldn't. The only thing that has been bringing me happiness over the last 8 months has been lifting.

I'm not sure if this is just depression, or if there is an easy solution, such as moving out and transferring schools.

I have OCD that stems from a fear of spreading the cold sores I get to another part of my body and/or infecting those around me. When I first got cold sores, I only worried about it when I had an active sore, and even then would only carefully wash my hands if I touched it directly. Then, during my search for treatments and information, I learned how immensely contagious and easy to catch/transfer this virus was and I got a little more worried. But then I found out that the virus can be caught/transferred at any time via asymptomatic shedding and all hell broke loose.

I am now a compulsive hand washer and I am consumed with avoiding the virus. On a good day, I wash my hands three or four times an hour. I actively avoid any and all surfaces or things that could potentially be “contaminated” which is virtually everything in my own home. Not to mention that I avoid all personal contact with people for fear of passing it on to them. 

If I can be contagious at ANY time, am I not doing the right thing by being safe ALL the time? Those around me have voiced concerns about me being ""out of control"" and are pushing me to seek help.

As the title says, I just started grad school. I'm doing research the summer before school actually starts because I wanted to get my foot in the door. I knew it was going to be a rough 5 years, but I expected a lot for my first week (last week), and none of my expectations were met. My labmates are nice, but my boss/PI is NOTHING like what he was when I visited the school and how he was through email correspondence.. 

I guess my biggest problem last week was that I expected too much, and the disappointment made me miserable. On my first two days I was rushed around and yelled at for not doing experiments (my FIRST day), in a lab that's doing techniques that I barely know anything about, and I was in lab for about 13 hours each day my first week.


Now I've had the weekend to recover, I went in yesterday with a good attitude, and everything went really well, the things I'm learning and doing are really interesting and I got home at a decent hour, and I felt good. Then I found out that night that there were a bunch of things I was supposed to have prepared for today (Tuesday) that no one had previously told me about. My boss/PI here has not communicated with me more than a couple of words since I got here.. and it makes me crazy. Along with that, I'm expected to know everything right away, with no previous teaching/observing, and every night I go to sleep and every day I wake up and think, ""what will I be expected to do today?"" and the answer (or lack thereof) makes me so nervous I feel nauseated.


So then during my free minutes throughout the day, I'm on craigslist looking for other jobs.. Random jobs. Some science, some secretary, some whatever. I feel so miserable here. And I look through jobs, and I feel like my BS is such a good degree, but it's only good for a couple of jobs. No one else thinks that working hard for a science degree means anything. I just want a mindless job for a while... a desk job, a sales job, I don't know. 


I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT. I took the major in college that I liked/thought was challenging, and now I feel so so stuck.
I can't even describe to you all the misery I feel because I feel stuck in this path (whatever path that may be), and now all I want to do is work at an aquarium and feed the fish. Or work at a national park and give hiking tours. Or go camping forever. Maybe I'm just lazy and I don't want a job? I just don't know. I wake up every day wanting something different..

My best friend told me he liked (and still likes) me and then I rejected him and things just became so awkward. He started telling me about his problems and it became worse (he's very emotional and easy to offend) 

He says he's fine with just being friends, but after 6 months of walking on eggshells, I started to limit my contact with him (to give him a chance to get over me) but when we do talk I still have that eggshell feeling. I'm a person who has problems wording things nicely, which doesn't help. 

Reddit, how can I make the feeling go away or word things better? I hate offending him but for me it's almost impossible not to because of (what I think is) just an innocuous joke or off hand comment.

edit: I'm a (straight) girl, I just don't like him that way.

edit 2: Ok, I can see that I didn't give enough info- I'm not ""walking on eggshells"" because he told me he likes me, it's because of the problems he tells me about. I only included the beginning because it seemed relevant. He has a very negative self image and sometimes I'll make a joke that has nothing to do with his self image, but then somehow it ends up becoming that. 
Ex: I change my facebook profile picture, and he says he should too (his is super old) I say something like: ""lol, yeah you should"" and then he goes off on a tangent on how he doesn't look good in any of his photos and how he never looks nice and has lots of skin problems (like acne) (imo, not true, but had no luck convincing him of that) 

I have told him that I meant NOTHING by the ""change your pic"" comment (as I do with every other time) and he says it's cool and that he knows that, but it never stops him from going on ANOTHER tangent about x, y, and z. I don't think he means to, but it just ends up happening. I hate having to plan out what I say just to avoid that.

edit 3: I can't outright avoid him because we go to a small school together and will have at least 1 class in which we'll have to interact daily, if not 3 or 4 classes like this.

This is gonna be a very long post, so be warned

I am 20 years old and I am currently on the 1st year of Software Engineering college. I live in Serbia.
Recently, I heard an interesting thing from my brother - namely, companies around the globe soon won't be requiring a college degree for programmers, being that a big percentage of programmers are self-taught. 
At the time, that meant nothing to me - it was just an amusing fact.
A couple of days ago, I was speaking to a couple of my international friends (One from UK and one from US), and we touched the topic of economy. I mentioned at some point that Serbian economy is really bad and that the average paycheck here is insanely low - somewhere about 300 Euros a month. They then suggested that it might be a good idea moving out from Serbia. They pointed out that I'm extremely well-versed and fluent in English, and that I might be able to take advantage of that. They told me that being a Serbian interpreter is a well-paid job, and that I should seriously consider looking for a job like that in UK or US, and if I found it, that I should accept it and move.

A little digression: I love English. It's been my passion ever since I was 7 years old and it still is. I wanted to pursue a career in English and wanted to study it, but was put off by my parents because ""it is not a well-paid profession and it's difficult to find a workplace with an English degree"". Because of that, I decided to go with my second favourite profession - Programming.

Moving on: At first I took their advice as a joke, so I never even looked into it. But, ever since that day, I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I decided to sate my curiosity by simply looking for job offers.
I was amazed by what I found - There were so many jobs, and most of them were very well paid (~15 pounds/h). I then looked for places to live and approximate cost of life in UK so that I could get an idea on how much I could actually make. After a couple of hours of extensive search, I concluded that I would make somewhere about 1000 pounds a month, after paying for rent, food, transportation and other expenses. That's when I started seriously pondering the idea of actually applying for such a job and moving away if I got the position.

My idea was: If I could work as an interpreter, it would leave me enough time to study programming privately, after work hours. I would get proficient with many programming languages and would start looking for possibly more prosperous jobs in the field of Software Development, while dong something I love and making enough money for a living, plus enough to start saving up for my own place at some point.

So, my question is, dear reddit, should I go through with it? Also, if yes, how should I break the news to my family, being that they are very conservative and were always against the idea of me leaving the country (also they'd be against the idea to quit college since the college diploma means everything to them).

How Can I Cope?,8,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i4pie/i_cut_contact_with_the_most_important_person_of/,"This might be a long one, but i think it'll be easier to give advice if you understand how things went down a little better. so. I'm 17, I'm going through MtF transgender therapy. and i just cut contact with a woman who i devoted my entire heart and soul to for 3 years.

It all started 3 years and 6 months ago, February 2010, I've not really got anything going for myself right now, i like to play video games and talk to my friends, that's about it, I have 3 main friends. My friend Jake, who i spend most of my gaming time with we played all major games and releases and spoke to each other about them, but we have very different personalities. and 2 friends I only know through World of Warcraft I only know as Az and Fee. who i talk to a lot of the time about personal things.

So i'm on World of Warcraft, talking to all the people in my littler guild of only 44 people, when suddenly a 45th person joins! Moriarti81!

They seem very vocal and start talking about how they're new to the game but had always wanted to play, and eventually when someone asked in passing what their gender was, she replies with ""well, currently I'm male, but i'm hoping to come out to my parents soon and get treatment to become a woman."" and that gets everyones attention.

They start asking all kinds of questions, and she goes quiet, at this point. i hadn't been talking that much, but i felt bad, so i whisper her (Like a PM for anyone unfirmiliar) and say ""Hey, they aren't getting too much for you are they? you seem like a nice person, they're just interested, don't feel scared or anything!"" then we get talking for a bit in private about all sorts of things, one topic becomes another, and we end up spending the entire of the rest of the night talking about games we'd played, and our experiences in them, joking around and talking pretty much non-stop. and the next thing we knew. it was 4am and she has to go offline.

Things like this continued for about 4 months, i speak to her every single day like this and we become pretty much inseparable. i end up talking to my other friends a lot less, and eventually i noticed that Jake had deleted me from his friends list entirely. so the only person i was talking to these days was Moriarti81. who i now called Mort because i misread her name as Mortiarti81 the first time i met her, and the name kinda stuck, we were talking one day about all the things she had to go through to actually physically become a woman, and the more and more i learned about it over the course of these 5 months, the more and more it fascinated me.. and this day, i remember it vividly. we were leveling in thousand needles. and just before she went offline, i figured out the reason it fascinated me so much was because i felt the same way! i proceeded to tell her this and she said to me ""wow.. really? you're sure about this Fim? i think you should sleep on it and see how you feel tomorrow."" (it was 3am at the time), and so i did. and needless to say, i felt the same the morning after. that was the day i figured out i was trans.

A couple months after that, she was finally putting forward her plot to tell her mother she was transgender at the perfect time, but was having cold feet, I'd been telling her every time she brought it up that she needed to tell her mother or else she wouldn't get proper treatment while her male puberty was still reversable (we're only 10 months apart, she's 10 months older than me.) and she ended up telling her mother after that, and she came back to me after it all went down, and the first thing she said was ""I could kiss you right now!""

Then another couple months later, October 10th, 2010, I maybe said to her what might have been the most awkward way to ask someone out ever! i said to her ""You know, in the future, i think i can see us being a couple!"" and she said ""Yeah! i can see that too!""  and she said ""Do you think you would like that? i would!"" and i said ""Yes! ofcourse i would"" followed by ""How would you like it to be sooner, not in the future, like, today, Mortsy?!"" and she said yes!

After that we were lovers for 2 years and 7 months. and up untill 2 years and 2 months into that, everything was fine, at that point in, we started arguing a lot more about pointless shit, meaningless crap, like why i wouldn't help her in a game, or why she missed a raid or something, stuff we had no reason to argue about, and she felt trapped because i was being clingy, the arguing was an obvious problem, but i never caught onto the fact that i was being clingy. i fixed the arguing though. and to celebrate, i used a hefty £500 i'd saved up, and went up to where she lived, in Leicester, for 3 days. from where i live on the isle of wight. these were the happiest 3 days of my life, we didn't have any kind of sexual contact, but we hugged a lot, kissed a lot, and in general spoke as well as we always had online, it was amazing. and i wouldn't trade it for anything. 

We managed to make it another 2 months after that, and then one day after school, she comes online and says she doesn't feel like taking because ""we've already spoke before a lot and theres nothing new to talk about, so whats the point?"" calling that as obvious bullshit i followed up on it, and we got into the first argument we'd had in 2 months. and she stops talking to me for the night, the day later, she broke up with me..

I didn't see that coming.. at all, we had our problems, but they were manageable, and i still loved her with every ounce of my being. so after this.. we stopped talking for a week then got back in contact. and we start talking almost half as good as we did before, sorta forcing conversations, not having interesting things to talk about. but something was different.

Last week i figured out what was different, she didn't care if we made it or not. i was the only one putting effort into talking any more, and whilst she replied, if i never made an effort to talk to her, we'd never talk. on top of that, she'd still been acting as good as ever to all her other friends. and i felt upset by that.

So today, I messaged her. and asked about everything, and in the end, it ended up with us cutting contact. we aren't talking any more. but i feel like this is unavoidable. and even with that said, i wish we'd ended it when we werent on a sour note, if you really want, you can read the full conversation here. http://imgur.com/a/CyTYx (she decided her name was going to be Fae, and i chose mine as Felicia.)

And now.. it feels like I've had a part of me ripped out. like life has no point. i don't feel.. depressed or anything like that, i just feel like there isn't any reason for me to do anything, and i ask you Reddit... how do i cope with this? 

TL;DR: My girlfriend of 3 years broke it off with me a couple months ago. and today we cut contact. and I don't know what to do any more. how do i cope with losing a huge part of my life?",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_1i4pie,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i4pie/i_cut_contact_with_the_most_important_person_of/,

""Incorrectly Cleaning their windshield at a Gas Station. My biggest pet peeve is when I'm driving with someone and their car has a dirty windshield. You are risking the lives of yourself, and your friends/family by not having proper visibility of a clean windshield, or any windows in a vehicle for that matter. I watch people cleaning their windshield at the Gas Station and am shocked to see them leave with more of a mess than when it was dirty. When you dip the squeegee/sponge in the water, swish it around a bit to get the dirt off from the last user. First, grab a few paper towels, your wet squeegee/sponge, and proceed to lift your wipers up. Clear any debris that is under them. Start from the top of the windshield and scrub (not lightly graze) SCRUB your windshield!. After the windshield is washed, it's time to squeegee. Start at the TOP of the windshield furthest from you and squeegee towards you in a firm, slow, even pressured motion. Now, you'll need to start off where your last pass was finished. Always left with those tiny wet lines? Here's how to eliminate them. The edge of the squeegee that will be touching the portion that you just dried CANNOT BE WET. Use the paper towels to dry off the first few inches of the squeegee that will be touching the portion you squeegeed beforehand. Continue this process all the way until you reach the very bottom. Spot check and wipe with unused paper towels. Never wipe in circular motion, it will increase your chance at glare. Instead, wipe North and South (if you have to). You'll know when your windshield is clean when a paper towel glides across the glass with no resistance.""",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_1i3e4o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i3e4o/til_how_to_properly_wash_my_windshield_at_the_gas/,

I never intended to hurt them at all, and I am having a really hard time forgiving myself- no matter how much it wasn't in my control.

Every day I'm scheduled to work I dread going in. The work itself is easy, but meaningless. When I leave work, it feels like I have accomplished nothing. I'm not a very social person, but I'm able to put on a persona that's all smiles for the job. Unfortunately, this adds to the feelings of meaninglessness.

Since taking the job, some medical issues I have had have worsened, including nausea (especially in the morning), loss of appetite, and stomach pains. In addition, I had a panic attack a week ago, and I've never had one before then. The combination of appetite loss and nausea makes mornings before work difficult. I wake up nauseous, so for breakfast I can usually only eat an apple or some carrots. Some days this nausea/lack of appetite lasts much longer, resulting in only a few hundred calories eaten before dinner. During one three-day stretch, I lost five pounds from the appetite loss. On days when I don't have work (and after work), I smoke marijuana to give myself an appetite. It works wonders, and most of my daily caloric intake comes from me eating while high. I don't like relying on it for appetite, but currently it's the only way I can eat enough.

I want to quit, but my father (who financially supports me) does not want me to. I haven't yet explained to him the panic attack or the severity of my symptoms, but I feel embarrassed to do so.

So the next morning I called the local wild life rescue center to ask what we should do about it. The lady asked if we were able to identify the bird. We said it may be a baby starling based on what google search we did. She asked us to bring it to the center, where it will be euthanized if it is a starling, and if not, will be provided care. The center was over 30min away, and I had a phone interview I was preparing for. So I could not go. So we just took a little box, put some grass into it, and put the bird inside it, left it where it was.. not interfering with the natural order. Later we noticed a bird with some food in its beak near the box, and the next time we checked, the bird wasn't there.
This morning, the lady called and asked about the baby bird. She was very threatening immediately after we said we could not find the bird. She said she was going to call officer and turn me in for endangering the bird.

And these thoughts make me feel terrible.,8,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hlxpl/my_friends_are_wonderful_i_just_wish_i_had/,"I am using a throwaway because a lot of my friends use reddit. And I want to be clear that I feel absolutely awful writing this. I am in my 30's and single so I am sure I have my issues. I think I need someone to knock me down a few notches.

I am a woman. A programmer. I was lucky to have a job before finishing college. I have always loved science and culture. I have traveled a lot. I have a lot of hobbies and I love the outdoors and exercise. I don't get a lot of support besides from my awesome work colleagues. They are every reason I love coming to work and I believe they love working with me.

I have no idea how I turned out how I did. I feel that I am very different from others in my family. We don't really connect anymore. They work hard at their jobs and not much else. I have a sister who is a waitress. My Mom has told me many times now that if I would ""drop the weird science thing"" men would like me more. If politics come up any time the weekend would be considered ruined. I worked before college making an hourly wage in a job I didn't care for and my parents repeatably told me to think about what I was doing when I quit to pursue a computer science degree. I paid for college myself. I don't ever ask for anything from my family. I show, am pleasant, and leave. I never tell my parents about my personal life. Past several years they have stopped asking about it. I don't get any encouragement for anything from them. I hate admitting I am embarrassed of my family and I don't like bringing men around to meet them.

My friends are a different story. They are good friends. They are always there when I need them for a happy hour or a ride to the airport. They are just...simple. Every weekend revolves around drinking in some way. I feel like they don't try at anything else. I got into hiking heavily last year and at one point they wanted to join me. But every weekend when push came to shove they had some excuse. Several times I felt like I was being tricked. We would plan an epic overnighter I was way too excited for and the night before they would call up everytime, ""Can't go because X is having a party. But you should come to the party!"" Party? There was a party last weekend. I wanted to go backpacking. 

A few of us met in college. Everyone has a job but often I feel everyone is capable of doing better even in this economy. One was a teacher. She said she decided to quit because it didn't pay well. But she is a barista now. I often hope she is just saying that to save face because she was fired, I would understand. But she isn't trying to do much else. No one wants to ever talk about science or politics. I just learned today that one of my friends thought Snowden was someone I was dating. None of my friends have a clue what happened in Egypt today. No one thought what Wendy Davis did was important...if they knew who she was. They don't have any real hobbies. And I can't share a single thing I am into with them unless it is alcohol related. Their idea of a good weekend is drinking. No one ever wants to do much else. There is always some house party or everyone is going to the bars downtown. I don't understand how they aren't bored.

None of them have passports. None of them have ever traveled. A few use money as an excuse but they have no problem taking on large car payments or opting to live in an expensive neighborhood even though they have to commute further to work. And many make a lot of trips to Vegas or Hawaii. But no one has left the USA. 

Even my roommates drive me nuts. They just watch TV all day. If something is too hard, like changing a light bulb or untangling the vacuum chord, they will complain and cry until I finally do it for them. I feel like a constant babysitter. This morning I was late to work because one roommate was out of bread and had no idea what to have for lunch. I let her use one of my wraps but she had never made anything with a wrap before. Yes. These people are real. I would had left her and told her she needed to figure it out and it wasn't hard but she started crying and saying she didn't want to mess it up and be hungry at work. Sometimes I think they are messing with me. These are adults my age and they can't even figure out how to use a cast iron skillet.

So I am starting to resent everyone around me. I hate going home. I cringe when I get a text and hope it isn't a friend (I am the worst friend in the world). I am working later everyday because that is the only place I feel challenged. I have been teaching myself some chemistry at work and I picked up some spectroscopy gear. This is the first time I have told anyone. If I tell my friends or family they will just ruin this new subject I have discovered. 

I have started dating someone new who is very smart and from a different culture. I am too embarrassed to introduce him to my friends. I don't know how to talk to him about it. I am starting to worry that the not introducing him to anyone I know besides some colleagues will make him think I am not interested in him. I am also worried about how my friends will react. I can see them freaking out a little. 

I am not that smart so I know my attitude isn't fair. I often think about just walking away from everyone and burning all of the bridges, other than just having friends they add absolutely no value to my life. But feel like they are holding me back even if they don't mean to. 

I am a shy and nervous person so friends have never come easily anyway. I want to move and look for new places to live often but my area is very expensive and it can be tough to find a place this close to work. I want more than anything for the friends of the guy I am seeing to accept me since they are all so smart but they are all guys and I know it is important for me to have my own friends. I just want to be challenged and I want support to be a better person.  

I do meetups and have been to a few local science societies. I also go to city council meetings. I love finding people to discuss the things I am passionate about. But they are always very old or students there for extra credit. All my colleagues are either very old or just really involved with their families so while we go out for beers from time to time or comment on FB posts we aren't close. It would mean the world to me to meet people my age who like to talk about politics, science, and world new over a beer.

I want to say the rant helped but it didn't. I just feel disappointed by everyone I know. And that isn't fair to them because they are good people and if they are happy how they are there is no reason they should change. But I am growing bitter. I hate to say it, but I want smarter friends. I can't help my family but I want smarter friends my age. I am looking for advice. Perhaps others who have felt the same way. What I can do to change myself to make the situation better? Maybe rip my grammar apart. I didn't proof read so have at it.

It passed over though, he's his usual self again. Thanks for the help though, I definitely will pressure the higher ups more if this happens again.

Hello :) 
So. I can't really explain it. I'm a senior computer science major so a social life is already quite rough to maintain. In the past year I guess you could say I finally ""blossomed"" into a pretty cute girl. As a result of this, there have been guys who have tried talking to me. Whether it be just for sex or an actual relationship. The issue is that because of my time with homework, classes, a job, and my depression, I guess you can say I've become content or settled into a life where I honestly do absolutely nothing. I'm on reddit, tumblr, and Netflix all day long. If someone were to talk to me about shows and movies I can go on for hours and I seem like the coolest cat. But as soon as hobbies, interests and what I do on my ""free time"" comes up in conversation with a guy I'm talking to, I have nothing to contribute. That's not to say I have none. I play music, read, go to shows, open mics, play games and go to bars occasionally, but I feel like the way I talk about these things just makes me sound so boring and plain. Because of this, my confidence and self esteem drop into the depths of hell and conversations become dull and I end up never hearing from guys again. So I have a few issues here. Maybe I really am boring and need to change that in my life, I suck at keeping conversation because I get anxious about whether or not what I'm going to say will sound boring or lame or I'll end up fangirling accidentally if they make a doctor who reference or something. If my description isn't very clear, I'll be more than happy to elaborate on something. I also suck at explaining things so that's something as well. I don't know if it's a confidence boost I need or someone else who is homebody or something I haven't the slightest clue :/ 

Also if my submission just isn't clear enough overall please let me know and I'll delete it and try again once I figured out exactly what I'd like advice on. Thanks! :)

One is not responding to the customer once a call has connected, and another is when agents make unnecessary call transfers. Zero tolerance means once they flag your call, you're fired; no questions asked.

Now, a coworker was sitting next to me on my station, and we were casually chatting, when he playfully hovers my mouse to the ""ready to take calls"" button. Of course, I trusted he wouldn't dare, because no one is that big of a dick, and we were basically on standby mode because it's still learning lab. We didn't have to take anymore calls, actually we weren't supposed to take anymore calls without a supervisor monitoring it so he can jump in and take over at the moment one the call shows signs of going bad. But he did. He clicked the clicker and I was on ready status. No less than three seconds before I could push him away and undo his mistake, a call connected. So I panicked. I had to fumble. Called a supervisor's attention, told him a call has connected and he yelled ""TAKE THE CALL"". I fumbled and had to plug my headset back in and apologize to the customer for 20 seconds of dead air while the coworker in the station next to me explained how the dicky guy pressed the button on my station. Now, this call was bad. What she was asking me to do was too much for my newbie brain to comprehend. I had no prior call center experience, and it was my first day in learning lab, where calls HAD to be monitored by supervisors so they can coach us and save us when things go bad. This was really bad. She was asking for a payment extension of 15 days, and the system would only allow us to give her 14 days. Fair enough, I mention that I can't because it's over 14. Now, she asked me to help her out because she's been a loyal customer for years. And it was only one day. Of course, I was thinking ""yeah it's only one day, why not"" but then again, it would be breaking the rules. Now, at this point, had I had a supervisor to ask, I would ask if it would be alright for the customer to call back the next day, so I could process a 14 day payment delay, but I had no supervisors. I raised my hand, a supervisor comes close, I tell him the situation and he says I should say something along the lines of ""I can't do 15 days, but since you're a valued customer, I could do that"" and of course it didn't sound right. Before I could clarify he walked away. I got back to the customer and begged for another minute. I called another supervisor and he told me to transfer it to our Collection Services department. It made more sense to my panicking mind to do that, so I did. But now, thinking back on it, what if it wasn't necessary to transfer the call? Will I get flagged? 

Can I report the dick who deliberately put me on the spot and the two supervisors who did not even plug their headphones in to even attempt to assist me? Oh, this is the best part. The two supervisors were just discussing with other agents; what the agents' weakness and things to improve and and whatnot were. I'm not a tailored professional yet, but I'm pretty sure what they were doing could have been paused because my situation was more dire. And they KNEW that it wasn't me who clicked on the accept call status if they were listening to our pleas.

The whole time we'd been talking about him coming down for my 18th birthday celebrations (which was this past friday). 
The trouble is, throughout our teenage years he's had a shit habit of ditching me (without any notice) to go get high with his mate. 
His mate, H, is a cunt- he's one of those guys who just refuses to grow up, feels like the world owes him something, and likes to think himself a great philosopher. 
As I mentioned, for so often has J ditched me to get high. This situation was different. We hadn't seen each other in so long, and I'd messaged him a couple times on the day of my birthday celebrations to let him know what time we're all meeting up etc.
It gets to 19:00, and I call J to ask him where he is. You can guess where he's going.
This was a 'last straw' moment for me and bugged me for the whole night, aand it's still bugging me right now. 
He did say he'd try and make it. Take note, the bus to H's in a 10 minute journey and is every 30 minutes. So it comes to 22:30, and we're heading to town, I'm a touch drunk but not to a point where I'd do anything I'd regret, and I send him a text.

In short, the text
""Alright, whatever man, you wanna blow off your mates birthday to get stoned with H, you fucking do it, just dont fucking bother anymore if getting high is your fucking priority""

As usual, he responded with bullshit excuses about how he didnt have the time, etc, how he feels bad etc etc. 
He had 2 months to prepare, and even then he had 3 hours to take a 10 minute bus journey to get over to us.

He called up the next day as I was having a family barbecue, which he was also told a lot about. He asked if I wanted to ""Do anything"", which means one thing- he forgot. I was quite blunt to him, and he was talking as though nothing was wrong at all.

I havent spoken to him since, and I havent wanted to.

And the worst part? It turns out he'd only come down to the area because it was his girlfriends birthday yesterday.

My girlfriend says I'm just being stubborn, and I shouldn't let this tear our friendship apart, but I'm so upset about this and I feel like a very disappointed parent.

What should I do? Should I talk to him, or should I just leave this be? It's not like he's the worst friend on the planet, we've had some spectacular times together and stuck through for 14 years, but H has gotten in the way of so much since we were about 15 thanks to his promise of free weed for J. 
I do smoke, not often, and when I do I just don't like to smoke with people like H, and I've never gotten along with H and I doubt I ever will considering how much I dislike him, so that choice is off the cards.

Should I talk to him?

TL;DR Friend of 14 years forgets my birthday celebrations to go get high, not the first time.

EDIT: I should make the point that he's smoking weed, a lotta weed.

It was my first relationship and her longest by a long shot. We didn't have sex, but pretty much everything else. We broke up 3 months ago. We were together for around 2 years. Things eventually stagnated after I started working and seeing each other twice a week went to maybe once a week. We didn't go to the same school and it was about a 10-15 minute drive to see each other. Neither of had cars so most of the transportation had to be done by parents. My family is quite poor so her parents often had to drive, which when I apologized and thanked them, they always reassured that it wasn't a problem ; her parents and even extended family seemed fond of me. However, generally, this led to VERY alone time. I felt like we were both 12 with the constant supervision. She wasn't ready for sex and neither way, but it's more the principle of it. Perhaps under different circumstances things could have been better, but towards the end I was kind waiting until we both graduate next year because I plan on going to college out of state and felt it would be an easier break-up. The question of our relationship's condition was brought up, and we both usually agreed to spend more time together, but it was out of our hands. She brought the question up again. I value honesty and bluntness ; I told her that there is probably nothing we could do to fix it. She suggested a break-up and I agreed. We wanted it to be as mutual as possible, but I see now that such a thing can't really happen. 


We stopped talking for a month and I relapsed and contacted her on Facebook. I went full retard and spilled my guts. She said that she had moved on. I was teary eyed and begged for an honest explanation ; I said I needed something not vague to leave on. She said that I was a wonderful boyfriend, but she had just moved on. I was almost certain she wasn't dating anyone. Fast forward a month and I see she's dating a chick. (I don't generally have a problem with things like that, but I felt it in the manhood). I start up casual conversation and eventually ask if she was dating her when I asked to get back together. She was and I was kind of peeved. She said she didn't want anyone to know because her mom did not like the other girl then. Fair enough, but I just wish I hadn't exposed myself like that. The conversation got kind of bad after I asked her if it was all really that bad, since she seemed to get over so quick. She said yes, followed by incessant ""lol"". I tried to recover a friendly tone, but failed. 


And then last night. There was a smallish anime convention in our town and we had both attended years prior, so I expected to see her there. I pass by her, her girlfriend, and friends. I wave and kindly say Hi, in hopes of assuring no hard feelings. The response was an awkward wave from her and pretty derp tension. I'm not one for PDA's, but during our relationship, I reassured her I was not embarrassed of her, I just do not like it, but we would still kiss and holds hands in public just not very often. Anyways, at the dance/rave later on, when they see me, grinding ensued. Meh. As me and my friends are pulling out the parking lot to leave when the convention ends, we happen to be behind them and I noticed this when I saw her look back. I try another wave and she energetically waves back. Followed by a painfully obvious kiss with her girlfriend in the driver's seat. I'm not absolutely certain that this was an intentional for me to see. It didn't sink in until I tried to go to sleep and couldn't and kept replaying that moment. It cut deep. I've spent all night thinking of how I could improve myself to make her have some regrets. I've realized this is probably self destructive, but I just don't know what to do..

Yesterday I was given a new production sheet with a 35% decrease in the amount I am paid in each task. Previously, they would say it's because they improved the program and so it reduced time it took to do a task, but now I am working alone. 
They reduced my pay because they could, not because of any metrics of it taking me less time to do my job. If I were to quit, should I state why politely or should I play the game and say thank you and I loved my time here?

tl,dr Company reduced my pay because they could. I want to quit but wondering if I should speak my mind or play the game

Edit: thank you for the responses. This has happened 4 times in different divisions within my company but there was always a warning that they would be paying us less for a task because, as a group, we were working faster. This time I'm the only one that does this task and I found out about the decrease by being asked to move production sheets I was sent in an email.",,False,,t5_2qjdm,1371313391.0,,,True,t3_1gcmgt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gcmgt/thinking_about_quitting_my_job_should_i_politely/,

I don't usually post, i mostly lurk this subreddit. 2 days ago my girlfriend started experiencing pain down under, she couldn't go to the bathroom and couldn't even walk straight at one point. Monday she went to see her doctor and she was diagnosed with genital herpes (HVN2). 

My first reaction was... w...ww..wwhat? After some reading i still don't quite understand what i am up against. 

First of all, how the hell does one suddenly get her first herpes outbreak after 4 months of monogamous dating? Apparently the incubation time of herpes is 2-12 days. I have never had an outbreak, i have never had a cold sore or anything related to herpes. I read that i could by an asymptomous carrier but that still doesn't explain that she's had her first outbreak 2 days ago. Does anyone have experience with this and if so, what should my conclusion be? She means the world to me, assured me that she didn't cheat which i really do beleive, but i find it hard to understand what has happened. She's done an STD test a month ago but apparently they don't test the HVN2 component.

Secondly we've had unprotected sex while she started having her first symptoms. Should i go see a doctor? I found a red spot today (which could just be a result of me furiously masturbating last night) and am worried to death that i might've caught something. If i do have herpes now (and this would be my first outbreak), is it safe to assume that she gave it to me? And is it safe to assume that if i have my first outbreak now, and she's had hers 2 days ago that she must've caught it from someone else a week or 2 weeks ago? I'm so incredibly confused, words can't even begin to describe.

Third case scenario. I didn't catch anything. What are my options? I love this girl to death. We're incredibly sexually active. Will things change? Can i still have unprotected sex with her if she doesn't have an outbreak? What are the odds of me catching anything?

Background: I'm a 21f junior in college, double major, very active in all kinds of sports and music, living on my own with two jobs and already racking up student loan debt.. idk what else is relevant but you can ask questions if you'd like..Basically within the last two weeks it feels like everything is falling apart all at once. My dad is an abusive alcoholic, and the other night he was piss drunk and yelled at me...

 ""Do you know what it's like when I'm out golfing and all the guys are bragging about their kids, and I have nothing to say for you? How embarrassed do you think that makes me?"" Among a ton of other things and psycho behavior, but you get the picture.. He's also been divorced three times and I'm pretty sure is bipolar.

Today is my mom and stepdads birthday (yes they have the same birthday, cute right?) had a nice family night, then I noticed my mom decides to sleep on the couch, and has been for some time now I guess? She also briefly mentioned ""If things don't work out for __ and I.."" Earlier on in the day.. I'm nervous to ask if something's going on..

Two years ago I met who I thought was the one.. We were perfect, and I opened my heart, let him in, invested myself for whom I was told would be my ""life partner"".. but things kind of fell apart. We were on and off because of multiple reasons.. essentially I was 19 and naive and he's legitimately bipolar. Anyway, I recently confessed to him that I still love him, miss him, and believe in us... Idiotic. Needless to say he cares less than a rats ass about any of it, or me. So that's fucking cool. 

Additionally, I was fired from one of my jobs for being five minutes late. So until I get another job I'm going to be consistantly in the hole. Told everyone I quit because I was so embarrassed. So now I have like -$500 in my account because I just moved and had to pay the deposit and rent etc. As for the other job I still have, it sucks, and I work my ass off to make tips but it just gets blown away with gas for my truck every other day, and bills. Then today, found out my POS dad got really injured in a dirt bike accident, so as I was speeding out of the parking lot to go see him I hit the side of my truck on the corner of a building.... Huge dent and paint is chipped AF.. Another $1,000 in repair for which I have $0.

We don't really speak to our extended family anymore. They do/did lots of drugs, are extremely rude and disrespectful at group gatherings, my cousin hit on my girlfriend a family reunion, etc...

What's so upsetting about all of this is that my immediate family (mom, sister, and myself) have been extremely close all of our lives. We have never abandoned each other since my extended family has taught us how not to be.

* Current situation:

My sister hasn't spoken to my mom or myself in over 2 months. I'm very upset and worried for her (she was molested as a child by a fellow church member -- we're all atheists now except my mom) because of her past. I've always been her big brother. I've always been there for her and so has my mom. 

* What I think:

My sister seems to be upset because I was laid off work and am currently relying on unemployment to make ends meet and that my mom MIGHT lose her job because her union doesn't seem to want to represent the workers that are being mistreated (my mom stands up for herself and her co-workers as opposed to many others). I'm currently working a side business that is beginning to generate enough revenue to make my full-time job in the near future and the possibility that my mom will get fired is relatively low. 

These tiny bumps in the road, that we all seem to go through, seem to devastate her.I know my sister is really stressed and worried for us, but simply not communicating with your family (my sister didn't even bother to call my mom on Mother's day) is not the way to go.

I accepted the fact that it would never happen, but then to my surprise she liked a few of my pictures on facebook and added me on snapchat/followed me on instagram.

Months later she continues to like pictures and statuses of mine on Facebook, and because of this I continue to be interested in her.

My fiance and I are being kicked out of his parent's home due to, for lack of a better term, political differences. After my fiance and I both lost our jobs three months ago, we were extended an invitation from his mother to move into their home to help stabilize and readjust our situation. We have been living there for about a month now. We literally gave up everything we couldn't fit into our car. Our pets have been shuffled around from one friend's home to another because his father said he would kill our cats if we ever brought them around the house. 

My future father-in-law has us paying rent (and I do understand this, we are living in his home and using food/utilities) but he has upped the original agreed amount from $200 a month to $500 a month and...I can't afford that right now. It has been an absolute nightmare here. We are out of options. (My family is not an option either, as they live too far away for me to be able to continue working at my job and have refused to lend me the emergency funds.)

I am working full time now, and am catching up on all the back payments owed (car, insurance, defaulted utilities, et al) and we do not have the disposable income at the moment to say ""Fuck this shit"" and leave.

To be brutally honest, I have $38 in my account to last until June 14th. My fiance is looking for work. He is mowing lawns and doing odd jobs for the older neighbors for a few bucks when they find jobs for him to do.

I have looked into temporary assistance for needy families...but we keep getting shafted because we don't have children and because I work. I am unable to get an emergency line of credit because my credit card hasn't been around six months yet. I really do not want a Payday Advance loan. It isn't a (long term) solution to our problem, and I'm terrified of the consequences of being unable to pay it off in a timely manner.

He is a beautiful person and he makes me so happy. He understands me and I trust that he would do anything for me. 



We met when he came home from traveling, I was living with my best friend at the time, and she was a close friend of his as well. So he stopped by to visit ad catch up, we fell in love, he moved in, it was lovely. But as time went on his attitude started getting sour. He seemed to have a problem with everything anyone did, except for me. His overall ""asshole""ish nature caused so much tension that we had to move out. Months later, we moved to a new state together, one I had never been to. So here we are. Life is wonderful, everything I thought it would be. I am SO happy here. The thing is, his attitude has started up again, and it is causing a lot of discord between the other housemates. Now it seems that we have gotten to a point where we will have to find somewhere else to go. Again. 




I love him, I do, and when we are alone he doesn't have this problem. he is so sweet and just....loving and kind. But it is so easy for others to make him get so butthurt, he turns callous ad hurtful for no reason. I have tried talking with him about this, and I understand that he sort of reacts in the moment, and then rides out the feelings, and once the moment has passed, he is over it. I try talking to him about being the bigger person and letting things go, but he seems to feel like he has a lot of things figured out and doesn't want to listen to anything I say. Once or twice there has been a breakthrough of sorts, but he still slips back into it. 




This all being the case, I have realized that if/when we have to leave, I would like to leave him. I love him, but I just can't go through life attached to someone who pushes everyone away from us. But I have only lived in this state for 3 or 4 months, and everyone I know I know only because of him. What should I do? I am considering hitchhiking to my homestate (haven't been back in 4 years), I have family and friends there. But I am scared. I have no money, no friends.. I knew this was a risk in moving here with someone who, relatively, I only recently met. I just couldn't imagine that we would be going our separate ways so soon. But I am strong and I know I will end up fine. I just need some advice. 




Should I stay with him, talk to him more, try to get to the bottom of this attitude problem? Most of me just wants to leave, but I don't want to get raped or murdered. Is it true that some churches by greyhound tickets for people trying to get home? Is leaving on my own too risky?

He's choked her, hit her with a board of plywood, and has even had a knife at her throat. He has her convinced she's a horrible person, and tries to make her believe it's her fault he raped her.

I know she needs to get out, but she's gone to Child Protective Services in the past, but she refuses to say what went wrong, only that it made things much worse. I've developed the theory that she was raped after calling CPS, which is why he blames her. I've spoken to her about it, but she refuses to speak to them again. 

She also refuses to go to the cops. I imagine that's related to her refusal to talk to CPS. It doesn't help that her uncle is a less-than-good cop in our area.

She also refuses to run away and leave her 4 teen-preteen brothers behind. They aren't abused. She also refuses to tell me why she is so steadfast in her refusal to leave. 

She always tells me that ""It's fine."" Or ""I'm okay."" But being beaten and abused nearly daily isn't my definition of ""fine"" or ""okay.""

I want to get her out of there. I want to save her. But I don't know how because she won't tell me why she won't leave. 

The only solution that comes to mind is killing her father, which I would never do. The CPS and police have a saying ""No victim, no crime"" regarding abuse. If she refuses to talk then things are just as bad if not worse.

My foster dad expressed that he wants all three of us to maintain a relationship.  They do mean a lot to me so their opinions on my decision have somewhat of an impact on it. 

Here are my choices so far: 
1) Live with my closest friend's parents and her. My foster parents do approve of this but the mom of my friend isn't completely sold. 

2) Live with a friend's parents and her. Her mom has said she would love to take me in. I'm sure my foster parents will approve of this. 

3) Live with my boyfriend's (we are very, very close) brother and his soon to be fiancé. This would be my first choice but, my foster parents would never approve of this. 

4) Leave my boyfriend, his family, and my friends and move into an idependent living apartment that is 2 1/2 hours away from where I live now. I do not want to do this but this is the default choice if I can't find another place to live. 

I would love more than anything to move in with my boyfriend's brother and his brother's girlfriend (if they get approved, that is) but, the only thing holding me back is how my foster parents would not approve. Should I just ignore that fact and just follow what I want or what should I do?

Long time friend turned drug addict.,6,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dlkf2/im_at_my_witts_end_long_time_friend_turned_drug/,"I don't even know where to begin.  This is obviously a throwaway, I know reddiquette but please bare with me as english composition was never my best subject.  Backstory: I have know my roommate in question since middle school.  He has always like to party but I feel that this takes the absolute cake.  It is starting to affect my life and I am trying to generate a few ideas to try and confront the issue but it is a delicate situation. On with the story!

This all starts back on Back on Wednesday, April 24th around 10pm. My roommate, we will call DA for dumbass, just finished his class for the semester and decided to party. No big deal. I go to work the next morning, finish my day and then head home.  I find out DA is still drinking, a little crazy but fine. I have known DA likes to party pretty hard but, it really has never been that big of an issue, till now.....

On Thursday DA continues the drink-a-thon, hasn't stopped yet.  After I get home from work DA decides that MDMA is the drug of choice for the night.  DA is being all ""lovey"" with everything and everyone because of the drugs.  Thursday night is fairly uneventful.  I only wish that was the trend.

On Friday I wake up go to work and come home. I find out DA has bough Xannax, just cause.  He does Xannax all day Friday and Saturday(20 in total).  Sunday morning I am wake to the fact that DA is cold so he cranked the heat up to 85 then went into my room. He decided that my window that was open a crack, I leave it open for my dog he can get ""smell-o-vision"" while looking out the window.  While he is closing my window he falls on me while I am sleeping, I'm like ""WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!""  He says, ""your window is making me cold.""  Are you fucking serious!  I'm calling bullshit. 

Later on Sunday, after I go back to bed after being rudely awakened, I take my dog for a walk and prepare myself for a long day of playing video games and getting ready for the work week.  I'm playing away and DA comes up and claims that, ""either roommate #1 or myself had stolen some of his Xannax.""  We are like ""Nope, didn't touch 'em.""  He goes on to claim that we took them and he knows it and he is watching us. This has happened before, he takes sooo many that he ""blacks-out"" and forgets that he takes them himself. Then he blames it on whomever is closest.  Fine, whatever.  

I wake up Monday hoping all the shenanigans are done, boy am I wrong.  I wake up to find a absolutely miserable DA.  All he wants is water and to relax.  I'm thinking, ""thank god!""  It's over, the party is over.  I continue on with my day.  I come home to find an absolutely comatose DA.  I didn't know what was entirely going on but I thought he was just recovering.  I come into his room to wake him up because the night prior he woke me up at 4 am with his drunken shenanigans.  I see something chopped up into a ""line"" with a dollar bill ready to be snorted on his computer desk.  ""WTF is that,"" I think to myself. So this is shit where shit gets out of hand.

Tuesday morning, I'm getting ready for work.  I have to put my clothes in the dryer to un-wrinkle.  I'm too lazy to iron and too poor for the dry cleaners.  While putting on my clothes in the dryer I decide I should check on DA, he's been pretty quiet lately.  I open the door to his room and I see him laying there.  I'm like ""da......DA!!!!!!""  Nothing.  I walk up too his bed while he is laying down on his back.  When I can finally start to see I start to see in the dark is vomit all over his mouth.  I went to EMT-B school.  I immediately start thinking that the situation is dire.  

I turn on the light to his room, while I am freaking out.  Then I run back to him start slapping him in the face.  ""DA! DA! DA! DA, WAKE THE FUCK UP!!!!""  He comes too but while he does I hear him gargling on something, I presume it was vomit.  The idea behind it makes me sick.  I start gagging all over.  Think I myself am about to vomit.  Roommate #2 hears the commotion and comes out.  He sees the situation and instructs DA to spit it out.  DA makes it through.  I get him some water then I go to work with all the mornings events on my mind.

I have been thinking of this morning all day.  I can't get it out of my mind.  I am almost positive I just saw my roommate and longtime friend stare at death this morning.  Around 2 p.m. Tuesday I give DA a call to check up on.  He says that he is done and that was horrible.  He needs to chill out. THANK GOD x 2. It does not last.

I come home Tuesday evening to find out that DA has been getting his party on, again, and that vodka &amp; MDMA was the money ticket again.  I talk to him telling him that, ""you're out of fucking control.  You need to chill the fuck out.""  He agrees, mostly likely that the drugs agree.  I asked him if he was doing MDMA last night as well.  He tells me that it was not.  That in fact it was heroin......

""HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!""  Heroin, are you fucking shitting me.  Wow, just fucking wow.  I have been a long time weed smoker, but dabbled in some other things, but heroin is the next fucking level.  I go to work Wednesday and come home to a recovering DA.  He relaxes while watching some tv shows.  THANK GOD x 3.  Tells me that he is going to get back to normal.  

I wake up Wednesday morning with the past week weighing heavy on me.  I like my friend, when he is normal.  But he is like this he is do dumb to talk to or try and hold an intellectual conversation with. He is a shell of his former self.  I don't what transpired that day but all I know is I come home to a DA killing a 24 pack of miller lite.  I have figured all hope is lost right now for DA.  I lock myself in my room on Wednesday trying to shut myself out of the situation but can't help myself thinking of it.

I go to work Thursday still thinking of the past week.  I am going through my day of work and I get a message from a friend that DA wanted him to pick up a 6 pack for him.  Friend says, ""hell no.""  I am not contributing to this bullshit you have been riding on for the past week.  DA gets furious.  DA is telling friend he is not worth his time and that instead of only a 6 pack DA got a giant bottle of vodka instead.  That brings me to the hear and now.

DA is currently shitfaced passed out in his room rocking out to some Queen, although I kind of do enjoy the ambiance.  I sit hear writing this story looking for some advice and trying to get this off my chest.  This has been weighing heavy on me the past few days.  All I do know is that DA will not listen to anyone while he is intoxicated.  If you are not with him then you are obviously against him.  I am thinking of a few scenarios.  1) is confront DA at the next time he as his most sober and tell him of how much of an ass he has been. 2) Call his mother inform her of the situation. He is a momma's boy at heart and I almost think she could have the most impact, if she was fully aware of the situation.  3) Move the fuck out, back with my parents if need be.  Try and talk to DA but if he just shrugs it off his shoulders so be it and continue on with my life.

I am looking for any other ideas. I am at my witts end reddit.  Thanks in advance.

The other day my dad told my mum he didn't love her any more and so left. It was sudden and very shocking. I'm 21 and I have two younger brothers. My parents have 11 years left on the mortgage and my dad said he would pay it all off (plus bills) but now I am unsure with all the things that have come to light.

It turned out my dad had met another lady through a court case that involved my dad being witness to her husband beating her. My dad testified but nothing happened. This was a year ago....

He has been seeing her for the year. That a long time to lie. Christmas's, birthdays.... all sorts. My dad was always busy with work. He used to spend Tuesday's away because it was a long commute to work and back. He would also travel away Thursdays.

He also had a planned trip to Germany for work related stuff...

This is where is gets nasty. Turns out that in fact the Germany trip for work is actually a family holiday with his new gf and her children to Switzerland... Tuesdays he spent at hers.. and Thursdays he told work he was working from home but was actually at hers...

My dad is now angry and I am concerned for my mum and brothers. I don't earn enough to pay a mortgage and nor does my mum. I don't want to move as I don't like change. This whole thing is just getting to me. I am lost. While he is not my biological father he was there 21 years of my life and it feels like hes abandoning us. 

Any tips or advice for me?

She looks like she's in her 30s-40s. And it sounds like she's really sad or depressed. As far as I can tell, no one else lives at her house besides her, although she might get visitors. My theory as to why she cries is that she's grieving, or she has family issues.

I've never been the type that cared if some complicated method of doing things was slightly more efficient than the way I understood how to do it if there were no noticeable difference in performance. I've never cared about a lot of the nitpicking you see from programmers on best-practice protocols as long as they don't interfere with what I'm doing. I've never responded to a programming thread with a clever solution just for fun. I've never read a programming book outside of college. I get frustrated by having to do the dirty work of converting data types and dealing with the fact that there's oftentimes no built-in solutions to seemingly common problems in higher level languages. Or being up-to-date on the most recent CSS rules applicable to different browsers. Etc

Basically I have just never cared about coding, only so far as I am able to do what I want with it. And I also don't care about writing software for other people anymore. 

Now, I LOVE creating software and I find when I'm left to my own accord, I can create whatever I want and find ways that do it that work, especially with libraries out there that do a lot of the dirty work that core languages don't do - So my gameplan is to focus on this, what I love and create software that I want.

The problem is - What kind of jobs out there would allow me to work, make enough money to cover my bills and not make me want to smash my face against a brick wall at the end of the day like my current job as a programmer ?

Here's my ideas so far:
Cook
Part-time at a call center 
Janitor 
night shift stocking shelves at a department/grocery store 
garbage man 

Some other considerations I have are:
-Would prefer a semi active job but not overly demanding
-My pride as a 30 year old man that's already spent 6+ years working low-end jobs not wanting to bump into high school friends serving them french fries at a mcdonald's drive thru window in their mercedes (I know, fickle but honest)
-Not a fan of working with the public in general, don't mind working with others though
-I don't mind working any hours(days, nights, overnights), would prefer working long hours for few days vs few hrs in many days for transportation reasons and I have much better focus when I dont have to worry about working on a given day
-I'm kinda introverted so I get emotionally drained (not good for getting work done after)
-I'm not a tough guy (ie no security guard/bouncer jobs)
-ideally looking to make 25%+ more than minimum wage at a minimum
-trying to get paid as much as possible for as little time/brain power commitment as possible but i'm not afraid of working hard

1367255100.0,6,self.Advice,1dcjbq,"Wife and I opened up our relationship, she recently confessed that she cheated on me prior to this change. NSFW",6,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dcjbq/wife_and_i_opened_up_our_relationship_she/,"This is lengthy, I apologize.

About a month ago my wife and I went out on a date, we had a great time and she brought up the question of opening up our relationship and seeing other people. After talking about it a lot and coming up with some terms I had agreed to try this out as it was enticing at the time. Of note, our sex life hasn't been exactly what I've desired, when we have sex its amazing, but the frequency felt short. I've always wanted more and this seemed like a way to get more, plus one of the terms we agreed on was that things would be more frequent in our bedroom together.

The following day she spoke to me about it a little further, and then brought up if I would be okay with her going out that evening to meet someone. This someone was an online friend of hers, and I have spoke to him a few times so he wasn't a complete stranger. I said I was fine with it but internally I had very confusing feelings. It was a mixture of being somewhat turned on and very anxious. She left that evening to meet up with him while I stayed home. It was probably the longest hour of my life. When she returned she said it was okay but very brief. She said that he did scratch this itch that she has had for a long time however. This itch turns out to be that she enjoys being somewhat dominated. An itch that we both feel am unable to scratch for her. She also tells me that he is rather well endowed which she says was a surprise to her at the time. All of these details at the time were a turn on for me, and after we had discussed all of this we had a very wild night ourselves. Everything was great.....until I woke up the next day.

The details of what she told me proceeded to eat me up while I was at work, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Feelings of inadequacy crept into my mind and started taking root. A few days go by and we end up having a fight over these feelings I am having. She is upset with me as I said I was okay with this and I shouldn't have agreed to this if I wasn't sure. I am upset with myself for the same reasons.... Ultimately we end up working it out this time around, and have crazy wild monkey sex again. 

The following day we both agree to make dating profiles and see what we can fish up. Lo and behold the online dating world is full of men, not so much women however. Over the next few weeks my wife manages to setup a few more meetings with two other men, while I haven't even gotten a reply back from anyone. Also of note, the first guy has since stopped talking to her after their first meeting, so at this point he is out of the picture.

Anyways, days go by and she meets these guys and they don't satisfy her ""itch"", just poor nervous sex really. Meanwhile my attitude goes from excited turned on to self loathing depressive. As time goes by however I am finding I am doing better with things, I am not a complete wreck when I know she is meeting up with someone and I am generally turned on by the whole idea.

Here's the kicker however, just recently while were in bed together having a heart to heart about everything she confesses that prior to us talking about this she actually hooked up with the first guy a few times already. Basically cheated on me in our own home. I'm devastated at this point, absolutely crushed. We continue to talk about things and I eventually calm down and manage to fall asleep. I end up coping with this for a few days and return to my normal view on things. 

So here we are, currently she has a few other guys she is talking to, one of which she wants to be a regular as he scratches this itch ""itch"" of hers. They have been out a few times already and its escalating rather quickly. She feels that she would want him at least every other day, her words. Meanwhile I have giving up on the online dating as I haven't gotten any messages back. I've deleted my profile as I am just frustrated with the whole idea of it. I don't even know how I feel about things anymore, after her meetings she comes home and rocks my world and I love it. But once the high is over and I wake up I feel inadequate or second best. I've tried explaining to this to her, but it always erupts into a fight. She claims I rock her world and she will never leave me and loves me, and I want to believe her, I just struggle with it. I don't want to feel like this, I want to have that self confidence, I want to firmly believe that this is just a part of her and that if I can just accept it our lives will benefit. Looking at things from afar I can see our sex life has dramatically improved, I do feel closer to her....but there is just something that I can't put my finger on that creeps up out of the dark and puts me in a funk and ruins everything.

I've known my girlfriend since high school and were friends throughout. A year or two after leaving high school we hooked up and have been together for over 2 years now. She graduated from university last year, I graduate in a couple months. She has basically waited for me to finish uni before we go travelling. 

Thing is I've been thinking about whether I really want to still be with her a lot recently. We had a big argument on a night out a week ago and I said everything that has been on my mind, however, I think I've been weak in saying it was down to stress *and alcohol* (I'm at the final stages of final year reports etc.) when it was all true; things like she has been preventing me from living my life how I want to, she moans when I want to go for a drink with friends and without her, etc.

She was an only child and seems to be very dependant on me. Her parents still spoil her even at this age (I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but it gives off the 'she can't do anything wrong' vibe). I will feel terrible telling her I am thinking about breaking up as she has had it in her mind that we are going away and keeps talking about ""our life together"". It's scaring the shit out of me. I feel like I'm missing out on independent life. It also seems like I have lost friends over the last year or two.

1365711733.0,5,self.Advice,1c5p68,My Mum is a functioning alcoholic and treats me like crap when she's drunk. I've tried so hard to help her and get verbal abuse in return. What do I do?,6,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1c5p68/my_mum_is_a_functioning_alcoholic_and_treats_me/,"My Mum has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember really - other family members say it's been about 15 years. She functions fine during the working day and gets up at 6am to go to work. Once she comes home at 2pm though, it's another story.

My Dad and sister, when i was younger, constantly tried to help her and encourage her to get help and go sober. Through them she's done nearly everything going: Alcoholics Anonymous (which only ended up giving her extra tips on how to hide it) and detox through the NHS (very easy to lie your way through).

Last summer, my grandparents made a plea for her to get help and she listened as my family has lost other relatives to alcohol. I was completely in charge of her new found strength and getting her help. We had originally planned on rehab for a month but she was so so terrified and our insurance (not covered by NHS) would not cover it until she'd tried out-patient treatment. So I took her to a psychiatrist, who was completely useless. We saw him once a month and he basically did not tell us anything we didn't already know. He did not build a relationship with my mum and just looked at us as a way of earning some extra pocket money. Throughout this she was on disulfiram (antabuse) which makes you throw up violently if you drunk alcohol while on it. However, it did not work as my mum discovered that as long as you took tiny sips of alcohol then it did not trigger the drug. Then, our insurance cover ended.

It is now a year later and she was doing pretty well. Not completely sober but not a mess either - it was bareable. Not anymore. She drinks from the moment she gets home to the moment she goes to bed and she often refuses to eat. My Dad and I know all of the hiding places for her vodka so we regularly find it when we suspect she's been drinking - and if you live with an alcoholic for so long, we don't need much to trigger suspicion eg. i can tell as soon as she speaks. Anyway, my Dad is often busy with work or walking the dog, leaving myself in the house a lot with my mum. If she goes to the toilet, i quickly go and find her alcohol and pour it down the sink. It used to be that she'd apologise a lot if i caught her, now it's the opposite - she blames me and says i'm a horrible person for doing that to her. Tonight alone, I have been told that it'll be my fault if she and my Dad get divorced; that I'm the reason our family life sucks; that she can't wait for me to leave for America (I leave in 7 weeks and will be gone for 10 weeks); that I act so superior to her even though I'm not; and that I'm no better because I used to be bulimic (little does she know that my bulimia is back, stronger than ever due to the stress she puts me through).

What do I do? I love her so much, she's my Mum! And when she's sober she's a wonderful woman. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it because my Dad just complains about it and gets angry, and my sister isn't at home anymore. I went to Al Anon once and it was a good meeting, but i don't have the time for it. I just want her to get better and fight her addiction.

tl;dr - my mum is an alcoholic and it's messing me up inside. What do i do?

1365655428.0,6,self.Advice,1c47hq,My parents found out I smoke weed somewhat regularly and are going to be drug testing me from now on. Advice on how to deal with this situation?,8,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1c47hq/my_parents_found_out_i_smoke_weed_somewhat/,"To start, here's a little background information. I'm 20 years old and a full-time college student, but I live in the same city as my parents and see them once or twice a week. My parents pay for my tuition and health insurance. I have a job where I work about 20 hours a week, which covers most of my rent and other expenses. The rest of my bills are paid using my savings. 

About a month ago, I started smoking weed with a friend. It quickly morphed into me smoking 3-4 times a week, both with friends and on my own. I really enjoyed smoking - it helped me relax, sleep and feel great. I was still handling work and school very well, but did not hesitate to smoke in my free time. 

Last week, while speaking with a friend on Facebook I sent her a picture of a new pipe I had purchased. Little did I know, my parents had my Facebook password and had been checking my account regularly. The day after my conversation on Facebook, my parents called me on the phone and told me to come over to their house under the guise of a problem with my bank account (my bank account is a subset of my father's and he can track all my purchases). When I arrived, they sat me down alone and basically had an intervention of sorts. They told me that they thought my smoking was problematic, and that they would begin drug testing me in a few weeks. If my drug tests turn up positive, my parents will no longer pay my tuition and I will not be able to utilize their heath insurance anymore. It has been exactly one week since this conversation and I have not smoked at all.

I am having trouble handling what happened. On the one hand, I understand and respect that my parents believe they have my best interests at heart. I really appreciate that they help me by paying for my tuition and I love them a lot. With that being said, I am angry that they are drug testing me. I'm 20 years old - I don't see smoking marijuana as detrimental to the life of a college student. My grades have not dropped at all since I started smoking and I have not been slacking at work. The only reason my parents know that I smoke is because they violated my privacy and checked my Facebook. This feels like such a juvenile problem for someone my age to be having. 

If anyone has any advice for a person in my situation, it would really be appreciated. ",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_1c47hq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1c47hq/my_parents_found_out_i_smoke_weed_somewhat/,

1365369451.0,5,self.Advice,1bvhl2,I found out my best friend is gay.,6,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1bvhl2/i_found_out_my_best_friend_is_gay/,"So this post will be me half-ranting/half-asking how I should approach the subject matter...

I realized my best friend/guy I've loved for the past two years, let's call him A, is gay. 

My first suspicion arose around october, last year, when A told me about this new friend he had met through his cousin, he would chat with him constantly, even while we were going on dates and such. I shrugged it off, though, as maybe he was just getting to be good friends with him. 

When we flew back home from uni (we live in the same home town) I got to meet this guy. My second suspicion came when I would leave with other friends to buy drinks and such and when we'd return they'd have gone ""for a walk"". A would tell me that his guyfriend was stressed because he was going through a rough patch with the girl he was seeing. This lowered my suspicious a bit, but the whole ""going for a walk"" thing happened a couple more times.

The third hint I got came from his cousin. We were out eating one day and she told me, ""Do you know what A's deal with that new guy is?"" I shrugged and said he was a new friend. She scoffed and said, ""Yeah, I doubt that... Last time we were at his house, I accidentally caught a glimpse of the conversation he was having with him and he said, 'Baby, don't call me. My cousin and IAmA_TerriblePerson came over.' They had had a fight regarding the guy before so I wasn't sure if I trusted what his cousin was saying, so I just said, ""Well, as far as I know, they're friends and NewGuy has a girlfriend."" We left it at that. 

However, I did confront A about it. I didn't say anything about what his cousin had read, but did mention the fight they had had. He told me, ""She said she thought I was gay. Do you really think I would keep something like that from both of you? You would be the first to know.""

Fast forward to mid-february. A had to fly back home as he was unable to take classes due to monetary issues. I'm baking at home and get a call from a close friend of ours, she seems upset. She asks me, ""Do you know who this person... NewGuy is?"" I say, ""He's a friend of ours from our hometown, why?"" There's a pause and she asks, ""IAmA_TerriblePerson... Is A gay?"" When I ask why she came up with that she tells me another friend of ours, and A's other best friend, forwarded her some direct messages from twitter. A had left his account logged in her phone before he left and she thought the messages were for her until he saw what account she was in.

The conversation went as follows:

* NewGuy: That's funny, we're dressed the same tonight.

* A: I know. You think that might mean something?

* NewGuy: I don't know, do you?

* A: Maybe...

And later that night- NewGuy: I really want to kiss those lips of yours.

I froze, those were two comments from two different people I had received about the subject matter. My friend asked, ""Do you know anything about this?"" I did not mention the conversation I had had with his cousin regarding that, and again pretended I was not aware, just said, ""If it's true, I'll be hurt... Because he promised he would have told me if he were seeing another guy and so far he hasn't."" My friend dropped it.

I flew back home for Spring Break and I notice something is off. None of my friends are mentioning NewGuy, and I'm ignored whenever I bring him up. We did go out with him once, and he and A barely spoke, A was unusually touchy-feely with me, as well. Other days, I noticed A texting someone a lot. A few days ago we had been partying and he made out with a random, I was jealous, thinking it was with her, but then I managed to catch a glimpse of the person he was talking to and it was a guy's name.

This week, wednesday. I'm back in my uni town, and A retweets someone. I figured I haven't seen his tweets as of late and decide to check his account. I see he had another retweet saying, ""I like you. End of comment."" I decide to check out the account, for no apparent reason other than boredom. A few tweets down, there's a tweet saying:

* ""Thinking of you~ ""A's initials""...""

A has very unique initials, so that was undoubtedly directed to him. I go check out A's favorites, and some other suspicious tweets from him are there. That's when I notice this TwitterGuy's name is the same name I saw A texting.

This is the first time that I saw ""evidence"" first hand, so it was like getting a bucket of cold water dumped on me. I took a screenshot and texted it to A's best friend in our hometown.

* Me: Does this mean what I think it means?

* BestFriend: Huh...

* Me: ... You know what I'm talking about.

I call him, and he's nervous, but denies knowing anything about it. He knows who the guy is though, after some more sleuthing, intentional this time, they're friends on twitter and facebook. Knowing them, though, I'm sure he already told A I found out. However, I'm still talking to A normally after that.


**END RANT PART**

**I'm a mess of emotions right now. I'm not mad that he's gay, the reason I'm upset is that he didn't tell me earlier, despite telling me he would (when he told me this, he was already involved with NewGuy, so he lied). That, and the fact that he played with my feelings that way. He knows I like him, we go out, do everything together, get heavy with eachother, but it never did go past that. He could have very well been using me as a distraction so others wouldn't suspect anything, but damn, I could have played along if he had told me instead of actually letting my feelings evolve for real.

I'm conflicted. Should I confront him about it? Or should I let him do it on his own... I feel like I NEED him to tell me so I can get some closure and get over my romantic feelings for him, though. He'll still be my best friend, that part won't change.

In eighth grade, I sat behind a beautiful girl in my history class. She always kept to herself, and always had a book in hand. Whenever she did speak, you could just tell that she was a funny girl, and very intelligent. Let's just call her Emma.

For three years, I obsessed over Emma. Over time, I just collected the information about her that I could. I discovered that she liked to play video games, that she lived with her mother and younger brother, and she loved the same music that I did.

During this time, I hardly said a word to Emma. I regret this now, because she didn't seem to have friends at school. Finally, though, one day, I built up the courage to approach her.

Long story short, she'd been obsessed with me as well, we fell in love, went to the same college, and were together for seven years. I planned on making her my wife. She met someone else, and I just hope that she is happy.

To elaborate more on the relationship itself, things seemed to be going great. We rarely argued, neither of us (or so I thought) saw an end in sight. I wanted to spend my life with Emma, and I certainly thought she wanted to spend hers with me.

A few months ago, I had to move to a city two hours south due to work. She had to stay in our city for a few more months, though. We spent the weekends together, and we planned on making it work because we knew we'd live together again, soon.

One Thursday, I got fed up with my job so I decided I'd just take the rest of the day and Friday off, to go and surprise her. So, after a two hour drive, I arrived at Emma's apartment. I'd cleaned up, had flowers, and was excited to see her.

Pretty much, I knocked and no one came, so I just let myself in. I found Emma and my former best friend, and it ended right there. From what I know, the two are living together already. This was a bit more than two weeks ago. 

At this point, I'm just tired of everything. Up until a couple days ago, I was doing okay. But now, the reality that Emma is no longer mine, and will never be mine again, is kicking in. I feel like I can't breathe at the thought of her, and unfortunately I think about her all the time.",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_1biumd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1biumd/help_coping_with_the_fact_that_i_just_wasnt_good/,

What do?,5,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1b80rw/i_jumped_on_the_first_job_offer_i_received_after/,"I graduated in December with a degree in Psychology. I was pretty panicked about finding a job ASAP since I have student loans to pay. The very first job I applied for called me the next day, and hired me shortly thereafter. I pounced right on it, because I thought it was the right thing to do. I felt pretty lucky to have found something so quickly. Now, I find myself wishing I had shopped around a little more. I've only been there a little over a month, and I *really* don't like it. 
It's an entry level job in a call center of a major auto insurance company. It has absolutely nothing to do with my degree, I have zero interest in moving up in the insurance biz, and there aren't really any opportunities to advance my education in the direction I want to go. 

Now, I know that every job has its stresses and bad days, and I definitely don't mind doing an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. But is it worth it to do a job that I seriously dislike and don't see a future in for a modest amount of money? I feel like I could find something much more relevant to my career interests--and something that I would like a lot better--that pays at least as well as this job. But I have only been there for a short amount of time--is it uncool for me to dip out so quickly? 

Has anyone else had similar experiences? How did you handle it? Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated!

1363707355.0,5,self.Advice,1aliao,We purchased (leased) a vacation club membership which we are completely unsatisfied with but they said we can NOT cancel our contract. Is this legal?,5,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1aliao/we_purchased_leased_a_vacation_club_membership/,"My fiance and I went to a ""time share"" type presentation in Florida last September where we decided to buy into a vacation club. We read (more like grazed, since we felt nervous, anxious and pressured) over the contract and signed everything without noticing the red flags and are now sorry we did this.



The presenter showed us real time pricing info for resorts, cruises, and all inclusive vacations that we wouldn't be able to afford without going through them. He showed us all inclusive vacations as low as $500/each as being the average that we'd have to pay for a week long trip to places like the bahamas, including airfare. He brought up current rates on expedia and travelocity to show how they were hundreds if not thousands more than what this vacation club offers. Since we're getting married this October we thought this was an AMAZING savings for our honeymoon and life together...wrong.



We didn't get access to the website immediately to prove pricing he was stating. We finished paying the full deposit, in January so they sent us half of our log in info in February but we still haven't received the other half of the access. The access that we *have* received doesn't show ANY good pricing like he showed us then. All pricing is equal to or GREATER than anything on any other travel website, so we are EXTREMELY upset that we were mislead.


We decided we wanted to cancel because we've been getting the run around from everyone there about the rest of our access to the information. It has been 2 months since our deposit was paid in full and 6 months since we signed up and we've not once seen what we were lead to believe was true about the club. We called them yesterday and were going to try to get all or at least some of our money back but were told we couldn't cancel AT ALL. Here is what the contract says about cancelling and money back information: (also, we agree we can't get our money back now)



* ""You may cancel this agreement without any penalty or obligation within three (3) business days after the date you sign this agreement. If you cancel you must notify Sponsor in writing...""
* ""Member hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that all payments made hereunder shall become non-refundable and shall be deemed earned by Sponsor immediately upon the expiration of the cancellation period set forth in the Membership Agreement.""
* ""In the event that Member fails to timely make any of the payments required herein, Sponsor shall have the unconditional right, in its sole discretion, (i) to terminate the Membership Agreement and retain all sums previously paid by Member; and (ii) to accelerate all sums due hereunder and require immediate payment in full of that portion of the Purchase Price then remaining unpaid.""
* ""Each party hereto knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation (including, but not limited to, any claims, cross-claims, counter-claims, or third party claims) arising out of, under, or in connection with this agreement or between the parties to this agreement, their affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, or assigns and irrespective of whether such litigation arises out of this agreement, by statute, or as a matter of tort law and the parties hereto expressly consent to a non-jury trial in the event of any of the foregoing.""
* ""We acknowledge and understand that (we) have the right to cancel the Membership Enrollment Agreement by notifying the Sponsor in writing within three (3) business days following the date upon which (we) execute said agreement and that if (we) do not return to the Sponsor all materials provided to (us) in connection with the plan, within 10 days of cancellation, the sum of $75 will be deducted from any applicable refund.""
* ""(We) acknowledge and understand that if (we) do not cancel the Membership Enrollment Agreement within the 3 day cancellation period, any and all sums paid by (us) in connection with the membership enrollment agreement shall become non-refundable and deemed earned by sponsor.""
* ""You are entitled to cancel you Membership within the 3 day cancellation period set forth herein and receive a full refund of any sums paid toward the purchase price of the plan....In the event you fail to timely cancel this Agreement, all funds paid by you in connection with the purchase of the Plan shall be deemed earned and non-refundable upon the expiration date of the 3 day rescission period.""



What this says to me is that if you don't cancel within the first 3 days after signing the contact, you lose everything you've paid, but nowhere do I see that you absolutely CAN'T cancel your contract. Am I correct in this assumption? We were SO stupid to buy into this thing and want out, even if that means forfeiting all of our monies paid.



**TL;DR: Bought into a vacation club because we couldn't resist the discounts we were promised during the presentation but now that we actually have access to some of the site, after 6 months, we aren't seeing the same deals that make it worth our money and time. We want to cancel but we were told on the phone yesterday that we CAN'T cancel at ALL. The bullet points above are directly from the contract pertaining to cancellation. Is it legal for them to tell us we CAN'T cancel?! I can understand being able to cancel and not getting any money back, but not being able to cancel at all??**

I got married to a woman that is 9 years my elder (I am 26). We dated for a year and got married since we were already technically a common law marriage and the tax breaks made sense. We were happy, we communicated about everything and we made a huge effort to keep no secrets from each other, no matter how difficult. 

I feel this is the time to say that I am bipolar, have been in and out of psych wards 4 times due to suicidal tendencies and mental breakdowns, and for the first time ever have managed to stay on medication for an extended period of time. I am a full-time student, something that my wife was happy to maintain (this was already true when she met me) provided I help out with chores and kept the house up. There were arguments about chores, sure, but they were always pretty tame. But there was a jealousy about my lifestyle that always seemed to generate these passive aggressive awful comments. She would apologize, tell me she used to be a bitch but she doesn't want to be that way anymore. We would make up, and it would happen again. And again. Anytime we get into an argument now, the fact that I am not working full-time while she is comes up. Any transgressions regarding chores are listed. It's just a guilt trip every time.

Money-wise, things are pretty tight. I contribute the entirety of my student loans, save for a portion that I use to pay for child support and to help with rent and bills. I have no other source of income, but it comes to about 13k a year. With my lifestyle before her, I could make it work with a bit of help from my family here and there and student housing. Now, I have no money to my name except some left over from a loan that is spoken for our bills. I've tried to work, but a birth defect I suffer from prevents me from being on my feet for prolonged periods of time, something I found out after trying to work at a grocery store. I lasted a few days, coming home and silently crying from the pain in my legs. I ended up doing two months of daily physical therapy to get up and about again, and even so it's an effort.

I have gotten to a point where I have no release. When she is not here, I am listing everything that is or could be wrong, trying to fix everything, barely keeping it together. No suicidal ideation, though I did have the thought that if I tried and failed I would be under her care, and that upset me a lot more than I even realized. I have a lot to live for and have no desire to hurt myself, mind. But my depression is now a constant weight around my neck, swollen from all the jeering and double talk and pointless arguments.

I can't get a divorce. My family, seeing me in a ""much better situation""(My family is under the impression everything is great), moved away. I have no income and little hope of finding a job that quickly. My car burnt in a fire a few years back, so I have no way to get around either. On good days, we argue a couple of times and ignore each other for the rest of the day. On bad days, all we do is fight. I am at the end of my rope, and I don't know how to even begin to fix this.

I've suggested couples therapy, but although she agreed it would be a good idea, 6 months after I suggested it we still haven't come close to trying it. I love her, but I feel like I've fallen out of love. I think she's on the same boat, but I don't know what my life will be once we get divorced. 

I don't know that anyone can help. I guess I just needed to be heard. I had to write this so I could feel like I still have a voice. If you stuck through and read this whole thing, thank you, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.

I met my wonderful husband 3 years ago online and fell in love. Decided I wanted to be with him so I moved from America to Switzerland to marry him (which would grant me my residence permit) and then planned on learning German until I could speak fluently enough to continue my degree at a Swiss university (since I'm only 20). 

Well, that plan didn't work out so well.

Due to different factors, we've decided to move to the US. I've already lived here a year and learned quite a bit of German -- but not NEARLY enough for proper academic conversation or school by any means. That means I'll be waiting 6-12 months here in Switzerland and waiting to go through the green card process so he can live and work in the US. That leaves me here with no degree, poor language skills, and no job experience. Chances of finding a job are minimal and the best I've found is giving private English lessons to the local students. I've managed to score 2 hours a week of actual tutoring.

We're living with his mom who we've given thousands of dollars (well, Swiss Francs) to be able to live with. We're both unemployed and would like to keep it that way. We don't really need money at this point since we've already paid for our living expenses.

What I ask of you...
if you were in a foreign country, without friends or great language skills, with literally hardly any money, with about 6 or more months of responsibility-free legitimate free time, what would you do? That's exactly my situation... and I would LOVE some outside views. I don't want to waste these months doing nothing and honestly... lately ALL I can think about is all of the great things I'll do when we get back to America.

That is not my dilemma though, my dilemma is what I should do if I ever get into an automobile accident with an undocumented immigrant like myself. I live in Illinois where **everyone** has to have car insurance if they are going to drive, license or no license.

I've already talked to my mom (who drives without a license but has insurance) about it, and I know that if the other person doesn't have a license I shouldn't call the police in case ICE gets involved, and I'm fine with that. My problem though, is what should I do in the same scenario but instead the person doesn't have insurance either. On one hand, they are being reckless by driving without auto insurance because not everyone has uninsured driver's insurance and that can put people in debt if their car gets totaled and they should get reprimanded for that, but then again I might be dooming them to getting deported if I call the police and then ICE gets involved. I mean I would be pretty pissed if that happened to me because then as a poor college student, my mom and I would have to pay for all the damages even though I was driving with a license and insurance and they didn't even at least have insurance.

To add on to that, I volunteer for a Deportation Hotline and have to listen to people tell their stories about how their X got deported or is in danger of getting deported, yet I would be the cause of that in at least one person's case.

Tried coke, didn’t get high but lost weight. Should I tell my boyfriend that I tried it or should I just loose the weight I need to and quit when I reach my goal?

I apologize in advance if I write my thoughts out a little disjointedly, but I have a lot on my mind so bear with me. I am a 22 year old female and I work in a strip club (yes, stripper). I have been stripping since I was 18 so I have almost 4 years in the business. I have an extremely loving and amazing boyfriend who I have been living with for a little over a year. When I met my boyfriend I was around 30 – 40 lbs skinnier than I am now. Unfortunately, with all the dinners out and with me working less so I can spend more time with my boyfriend, I gained a shitload of weight. It’s not a big deal to my boyfriend, as I do have a larger frame and have always had big boobs and a big ass, and it doesn’t bother my customers because my income has been the same. The only person that it bothers is one of the managers at the club. Even though I am one of the top 5 money makers in the club out of about 40-50 girls, I am not allowed to work his shifts which are the best days to work out of a week. Originally I was suspended off of his shift for getting drunk. I was in the wrong, I apologized, and was more than willing to be suspended for a couple weeks or so. Standard practice in the strip club. Now however, it’s been almost a year that I have been unable to work on that manager’s shift and I know that it’s because of my weight. How do I know? A girl, who happens to be skinny, was caught smoking meth in the bathrooms and after a month suspension, she is still working his shifts. I really need to get back on his shifts because I have several customers who spend major amounts of money that can’t get out to the club on the weekdays. That’s really just the backstory to my dilemma though. I have been trying everything to loose weight. I don’t eat much as it is but when I am not active, I tend to gain weight no matter how little I eat. I have been working more, which really helps with cardio, and walking a lot. It has helped to a certain point but the progress is just so slow. I was telling my best friend, who works with me, about my need to loose weight. She suggested coke to me and long story short, we bought a bag, I pussied out, and no coke was had that night. I did tell my boyfriend about it when I got home. He was happy that I didn’t do it, but he also is not big on telling me that I should or shouldn’t do something. Fast forward to 3 nights ago. I was working the shitty shift and I just snapped. I don’t want to be prevented from working when I’m damn good at what I do because of something so stupid as not being the right body type in someone’s eyes when there is an easy fix. So again, bag was bought, I only wanted a little to try so I gave away most of it and took the rest home. I tried it the next day, because who wants to try coke for the first time at 4 in the morning with a dog staring at you, and aside from a tiny buzz, I couldn’t feel anything. Tried a bigger line today and still nothing. The only positive that I’ve noticed is that I am down 3 pounds since yesterday. For this reason alone I’m probably going to continue to do it until I get down to my goal weight. If I started feeling dependent on it, I would not continue to do it. I know myself pretty well and, in the past, have stopped drinking and smoking weed cold turkey when I felt that the substances were starting to influence my decisions. My real question is, should I tell my boyfriend that I tried it? I know he would definitely be disappointed in me and I really don’t want to let down someone that I love so much. He recently went through a host of medical problems that kept him in the hospital for 3 months and is out of work right now so I am the sole provider. I feel that loosing weight quickly would allow me not to stress so much and be able to relax more when I am around him instead of feeling like shit that I have to be at work about 6 days a week and leave him without a car, by himself , in the house instead of taking care of him. I’m so sorry for the wall of text but I really needed to let some of this stuff out. If you read this far you fucking rock and I love you. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

As soon as I heard the door open, I bolted out of bed, fists balled, ready to give somebody the beatdown of a lifetime. If I hadn't seen his toolbox, I may have killed the poor man. 

He claimed he wanted to repair the vinyl floors in my apartment, which made absolutely no sense considering my floors were new when I moved in less than half a year ago.

I ushered him out of my house and he made a phone call to the apartment offices, and it turns out they had the wrong house. (There's apparently another building with my number in the neighborhood,) but holy dog balls batman, how the hell do you have the key to my house if you're not even supposed to be there? What the hell, how do you fuck up this badly?

I called the office and calmly explained the situation to them, but I got a weak apology at best. She did that fake uninterested laugh and tried her best to weasel her way off the phone with me. It's my opinion that what happened yesterday morning was totally NOT cool. Am I justified in being upset?

Would you have reacted the same way? Should I do something about this? Should I seek compensation of some sort?

I'm introverted but I still go out with groups (3+) once in a while and enjoy it.

I have a pretty good friend who goes to a university.. a big party school and he wants me to come out to visit for a weekend. I really want to go hang out with him, play guitar, see his dorm and what it's like living there but he mentioned that he also wants to take me to a frat party with copious amounts of drinking.

Frankly, I'm not interested in going to a frat party to drink. Drinking is just not something I do for a number of personal reasons. I am aware of how uncool that is.

Is there a lot of pressure to drink at a frat party? I don't want to be the one dude 'killing the vibe' because I'm not drinking.


I'm considering a couple things:

1. Go to the frat party and at least hold a drink so people think I'm drinking

2. Tell my friend I slipped a Xanax and can't mix with alcohol and that ""it's my way of having fun"" and then go but not drink (Lame I know but this has worked in the past in another situation with someone else)

3. Just show up in the morning and hang out till the evening and drive home that night instead of going to the frat party. It's only a couple hour drive so making a day trip to this school is not unordinary, I could tell him I have something important in the morning to do.

4. Be blunt and tell him I'll come visit but I don't want to go anywhere there's drinking. But he drinks every weekend so I would kind of be spoiling his fun if I did this.

Thank you if you read this far.

TL;DR: Been together 6 years, but not living together. Planned to move in together in about 6 weeks but his ex just found out she has MS. He wants to do everything he can to help her which ultimately means we can't live together anymore... Our kids both have special needs, his son significant and debilitating. His ex hates me, and he hasn't told her about us moving in together yet. But looks like we wont now anyway. See long version below.
Long version:
I need some advice. My partner and I (44 &amp; 45 respectively) have been seeing each other for more than 6 years, I am the female. We met in hospital when both of our children were being treated for cancer. Both children are now cancer free. However his son also has VCFS, a genetic disorder that has caused developmental delays as well as behavioural difficulties, heart defects, curvature of the spine and more. My son is very high energy and has also been diagnosed with Aspergers... My partner currently has his son every second weekend, and goes to his home to put him to bed several times a week and will stay with him when needed so the ex can go out. We do not live together currently, he has a flatmate to help pay the rent, but had planned to move in together in about 6 weeks, and in a year move to the country so we can start a business and get a house. We currently live in a very expensive suburb and life is very difficult living apart.
However, last week his ex was diagnosed with MS, so it seems our plan to move to the country is out. Now she has asked that he take their son half the time - ie he has him one week and her the next and so on. Our children do not get along very well - his son is very sensitive to all noise and well my son makes noise... one weekend a fortnight would have been manageable but not as frequently as she has currently asked.
The decision was made before even talking to me about it, and was her idea, she needs more rest. The situation is that if we moved in together it would be at his flat which is a 2 bedroom, but it just wont work for an entire week with our boys sharing a room. So it looks like moving in together will be off the table as well, which means essentially our relationship will be over because neither of us can cope anymore with a part time relationship for many reasons.
My question is, has anyone else had a similar situation and how did you manage it? Can you suggest some solutions apart from what I have stated above?",,False,,t5_2qjdm,1363003091.0,,,True,t3_1a2o1g,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1a2o1g/my_partners_ex_just_found_out_she_has_ms_they/,

It's something I've often had issues with and I want to stop it.

I'm not feeling good about myself at all. I have a lot of confidence when doing stuff, but I'm not secure in myself as a person. I often find myself wondering why people like me, or if they even really do, and thinking I'm a bad person, awkward and weird and embarrassing and ugly, unmotivated and lazy and weak.
But sometimes I have phases of unstoppable confidence, where I feel like all my doubts drop away, like I'm flying. Then I lose the ability and fall again.

These days it feels like most of the time I'm falling, but so slowly I don't even realise it.

I can't get close to anyone, cant talk to anyone, every time a prospect for a relationship comes up I quickly stop it, telling myself reasons why it wouldn't work. I favor sexual attention from guys who don't care about me, which I know is unhealthy. I've always had this idea of how I want to be, positive, happy, not afraid of getting hurt because I know it happens and it's an experience and I am strong enough to get through it.

My mom told me to move in with her so I could save money to hike the Appalachian Trail (my life-long dream), so I moved in after college, feeling as though I would not be able to exercise in Florida (flat land) like I could in the Appalachian mountains (where my parents live), and I would not be able to save up money if I had to pay rent.

I asked my mom if she wanted me to work at her shop for her while I was looking for a more permanent job so she can stay home and work on her art, she said yes (this takes care of my room and board, I work for tips). I keep my room and bathroom clean, I do my own laundry, I do the dishes (which I hate doing), and sometimes I cook for them.

I also work at a hotel, with my mom, as a maid.

There have been a little things building up to my poor opinion of my mother over the past 15 years, but today takes the cake. She said something about the sequester bill and obama being responsible for it. I kindly corrected her, telling her it was, in fact, the republicans who created the bill.

How do I get out of this situation, or do I stay and ignore her until I hike the trail?

I have been nothing but supportive of all of her goals, but for some reason she shoots all of my life goals down, telling me that I am too stupid or too naive to accomplish them.

Four years ago I was diagnosed w/ Asperger's Syndrome, which is pretty mild, but hard to live with.  I have a 130 IQ but GPA of 2.8ish because I didn't have to really work/study until 8th or 9th grade and find it difficult to work hard.  Until college I barely had any friends, and living off campus with relatives made it difficult, but I'm actually talking to people haha.  *Since becoming a teenager, my only strong interests have been art (movies/TV/music/books/gaming), and I often wish for more career-oriented interests.*  

I'm a critic at heart, and can't help but analyze everything.  I'm also pretty self-aware, and realize how self-sabotaging/pessimistic I too often *but can't help it*.  Smart as I am, I find so much of school painful because it just feels like work between me and a degree (ex: I took a Research Writing class centered on a paper three times before passing).  There's also a **huge** problem with focus - simple assignments can take hours because I aimlessly browse the internet, think about music, anxiously scrutinize social interactions, etc.  Unless I master it, this will become a problem when I (hopefully!) get some sort of job writing about entertainment.

I'm on depression medication that works but doesn't get me all the way ""there"".  There have been no traumatic events in my life, but I'm not a responsible adult, and can't help but wonder what's wrong.  I recognize laziness, focus, time management, and discipline as problems, but find it *almost impossible to learn them*.

I'm trying to be more optimistic, and this year I set out to actually change things: get back into learning Spanish, write regularly (even if it's a blog nobody else reads), joined [NoFap](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/), losing weight slowly but surely, put my Xbox away for good 1/2 weeks ago (can't remember lol), and have a real girlfriend for the first time. Despite this....she's younger than me, is raising a 1 y.o. daughter, and is an internship away from being a Pharmacy Tech (making me feel unsuccessful).

We have a pretty nifty party planned. But she has told that her last birthday party thrown for her was a surprise party and it was the worst party she had ever had, she has made it clear from this event that she hates surprises.
This is where things get complicated, her boyfriend comes to me after all this preplanning and tells me that he and some other friends are planning a surprise party for my friend... I tell him that her and I already have plans in the making and tell him about how she hates surprises. He just bushes off what I said, tells me that this surprise party has to happen. And that I can't tell my friend/his girlfriend about this her surprise party. I've become very upset about this whole surprise party thing, I've spoken to the people planning the surprise party about how my friend hate surprises and is planning her own party, but they just brush it off and tell me "" We really like ""friend's name"", and feel like she deserves a big party!"". Well fuck my friend is already planning a big party on her own and has a guest list of people all ready, but these people are using the same exact list for the surprise party because her boyfriend copied her guest list.
Some people have told me that there should be two parties for my friend's birthday, but the idea is just awkward and a waste of time and money for both parties in my opinion.
My friends birthday is coming up soon and she is out buying supplies all for her party, all unaware of this surprise party. I feel so guilty not being able to tell her about the whole situation. And I'm not going to tell her to not plan her for party. 
The people in charge of planning her surprise party are doing a shitty job 
Of Putting everything together. They have put together a pretty lame and confusing group message on facebook to the people invited to the surprise party. I dont think that they're going to make a event page. So now I've told my friend to make an event page for her planned birthday party to get the word out. I feel horrible about this whole event going on secretly between the two party plans.

1360913962.0,6,self.Advice,18kl0u,Husband told me he loves me &amp; somebody else,7,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/18kl0u/husband_told_me_he_loves_me_somebody_else/,"My husband and I have been together for 10 years and Married for 8. We have no children together, though I have 3 children myself (18, 15 and 12)

When we first got together I was a perfectly healthy 27 year old female. Over the past 10 years I'v been diagnosed with Graves disease and have become a shadow of my former self. I can't walk to well these days and because of that there is a lot of housework and things I don't do.

My children don't live with us, My oldest did until he turned 18 last year, but now he and a buddy live together. So it's just myself and my husband. 4 years ago my husband lost his job and became long term unemployed, we eventually during that time had to move across country back to where family was and we lived with my parents for 8 months, then he finally found work and for the last year we've been back in our own place. For a while I felt like our relationship had lost intimacy but I attributed it to the stress from unemployment and I thought it would get better once we got back in our own place. When we moved I tried to get more sexually active with him and bring back some of our romance. The Sex is very difficult for me because of the pain I have to deal with. I have tried talking to him about these problems but though he claimed to understand he never seemed to put in any effort into revitalizing our relationship.

About 4 months ago he re-united with a childhood friend, I've talked to her and she seems like a really nice person. But well yesterday (or does it still count as today, I'm not really sure as I haven't been to sleep yet). He was complaining about his phone battery being almost dead by the time he got off work, and it should last longer. I'm a tech geek girl, I live for gadgets, devices and computers. I've even built my own. So anyway I tell him to let me see it, so I can tweak it and possibly make the battery last longer. That's when I saw them, two text messages where they both told each other that they loved each other. Now I trust/trusted my husband and up until now he had always been very open and honest with me. So I calmly asked him why he was telling ***** he loved her, expecting a rational explanation. Well at first he said Well I do care about her. Then he started talking about how he felt she would be good for me and I was like ""Wait, What???"" Then he clarified he was talking about a poly-amorous relationship. Now don't get me wrong I'm generally a very open minded person and honestly I've had sexual relationships with woman in the past as well as men, both alone and threesomes. But never in a million years did I ever consider doing the poly thing. Especially right now while my self esteem is VERY VERY low because of my illness.

He told me that If he never talks to this woman again it would hurt him and that would hurt us because he would be stressed and unhappy and he wouldn't be able to forgive me. I'm dumbstruck. I love this man and I want him to happy. Don't get me wrong I'm not completely ruling out poly at all for my entire life, but right now emotionally and mentally I'm nowhere near in a place where I feel secure in our marriage to explore something like this. I'm just so confused and so hurt,mostly by the deception of him not telling me and being honest with me. He claims he was trying to figure out the best way to tell me.  The thing is, this person is in Georgia, we're in Ohio, so physically I know for a fact they have never done anything together, because he's never had the time nor opportunity to act on it. But emotionally I feel so hurt and drained. It's killing me and really I'm just so, so confused. I don't think I've ever felt so alone as I do right now.

So he says he loves me and he wants to make our marriage work. I told him he couldn't talk to her anymore. I told him that if he ever loved me He would be willing to not talk to her for at least while and give our marriage a chance to be repaired before I could ever even consider something like this, and he said he would.

He didn't know it, but I was logged into his Facebook at the same time as him when we was going to talk to her about it (we have separate computers) and though I didn't want to spy, I needed to know what exactly his thoughts were without him censoring himself because he knew I was over his shoulder. I did tell him immediately afterwards that I'd been reading their whole conversation and it's a good thing too because he deleted it.

(forgive me I'll try to be as accurate as possible as I'm writing all this from memory)

For ease of writing I'm going to refer to them in the following manner 
H= Husband
M = her
A = Me

* H: ""A found Our text messages and she was very upset. A says she was more upset about the deceit. 
* M: ""A was right to be upset, I have no desire to take her husband"". While I want this to happen at some point A has to be ok with it""
* H: ""So let me ask you a question"" 
* M: ""ok"" 
* H: ""So it's all three of us or nothing?""
* no response for a bit....
* H: ""so if things didn't work out with Me and her would you still want to be with me"". 
* M: ""I'm not going to be the cause of your marriage breaking up"" 
* H: ""well we've been having problems for a while now so if it didn't work out it wouldn't be because of you""
* M: ""Oh well I didn't know that you didn't tell me that. So you wanted to have your cake and eat it too?
* H: ""No I'm just saying that if things don't work because well they weren't meant to be would you still want to be with me?""
* M: Well if it just didn't work out then maybe we could work on something slowly"". 
* H: ""How much do you love me?""
* M: ""I love you very much
* H: ""Well A says she wants me to back off for a while and spend some time working on our marriage""
* M: ""That's probably a very good idea, you need to remember why you married in the first place""
* H: ""ok then so it will probably be a while before you hear from me. goodbye my love""

A few more things were said but at this point I was so fuming over watching my husband tell another woman he loved her that I just got up and walked away from the computer. I mean to me all this whole conversation says is that he's only backing off because he thinks that somewhere down the road there might be a chance to bring her into our lives. I've told him I made no promises, I've told him That I may never consider doing something like this.

I'm on such an emotional roller-coaster right now, one moment I'm ok and the next I'm crying and yet still again after that I'm angry. I just feel so hurt and betrayed, I mean because of other bad relationships in my life going including my parents I already had issues trusting people. I had finally found someone that I could trust and that I thought would never hurt or deceive me and yet he did. He still says he loves her. I honestly don't know what to think about that. How can you love somebody you've not even been in the same room with in over 30 years??? yet still He cried he told me if he didn't want me he would have just packed up and left he said he's staying because he loves me.... I'm sooo very confused

And thank you guys, thank you so much for listening to me.

Part-time job working for a social media company, make jack shit. I'm tens of thousands of dollars in debt after graduating with a B.A in a major at a big college -- a major I gave up on a year after college because my heart told my mind I could do something better. I live at home with my parents, potentially a bum. An idea of a great day to me is going to the gym, running three miles and then drinking seven to eight beers later that night. That is mostly because I have had suicidal thoughts off and on for a year and a half, yet I have no real close friends which to divulge my emotions.

I found out a couple years ago that my 28-year-old half sister (I'm adopted) had serious bouts with depression and was actually medicated for it. She also saw a psychiatrist, and the last time I spoke to her (about one year ago) she seemed to be doing great. She had a serious boyfriend, a good job, was traveling the globe -- all without meds. She weaned her way off of them.

I've never been medicated (at least by a doctor, that is) so I don't know if I would go that route, but I need someone to talk to who understands my situation and the mental anguish I go through every day just trying to get by. I find it troubling to sleep at night and have just as hard a time getting up in the morning, because I feel like there's no real reason to wake up because nothing is going on. I was inquiring about meeting with a psychiatrist because they deal with people like me all the time, but I'm not yet willing to divulge my life savings in separate one-hour sessions while lying on a sofa.

I'm a smart person who has experienced a lot in life, and I'm wondering whether my genetic makeup is affecting me. I never met my birth parents; only my birth sister (my half sister). And if she suffered from similar things psychologically, I have to wonder whether that is the case with me.

",6,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/18gqdz/friend_says_i_owe_him_money_wanted_to_get_reddits/,"So around 2 years ago while I was still attending university I became friends with a new freshmen, and he would invite people over to lunch with his meal plan (His father had enrolled him in a meal plan which was way more money then he could ever possibly spend on himself for that year). Jumping on the chance for some free food, I would usually get myself and my girlfriend food at the time, since he would say 'the money doesn't roll over anyway so you guys might as well spend it'. Free food for I think two semesters so it was a blast all around. The following year though that meal plan was changed to something more modest, and so I really toned down on asking for free food. Eventually I graduated and got a job though I visit the university from time to time. 

Now though he says that I owe him money, and that he wants me to purchase him a Wii-U for all the food I got and my girlfriend got. I was totally unaware of his intentions of him wanting me to pay him back, for if I did I never would have eaten all that crappy cafeteria food. 

Its a situation which thankfully hasn't put strains on our friendship, but it still bothers me as I don't ever want to owe anyone money. Its not like either of us were ever keeping tabs, and I'm pretty sure I stopped asking for meals once his meal plan changed to something he could only afford food for himself. 

so whats your opinion reddit? I've talked to a few others already and some have said 'you should pay him back' while others have said 'it wasn't in writing and he should have made his intentions clear from the beginning, so you owe him nothing'

The only reason I was even watching was because the kid was being a right bastard to his dad. Holding a toy gun, the kid was kicking and poking his dad and just being kind of a little shit. I remember this because I was thinking, ""that kid is being a little shit."" Anyways.

The wife pulls the car in the garage and the dad and son start heading towards the door. Once they're out of view of the mom, the dad just LEVELS this kid onto the front walkway.  He didn't hit him, he just pushed him really hard. I just stood there staring with my jaw dropped. 

The dad then proceeded to go inside while the kid just lays there. I think he hit his head pretty hard. The mom walks around and sees the kid laying there and freaks out pretty good, taking him inside.

So here's where I need advice. Should I say anything? If so, to who? Should I call the cops. Like I said, I'm new in the neighborhood and I don't want to make enemies but I don't want to sit idle if my own cowardice is the only thing holding me back.

Long story short I have been placed on house arrest for 2 years and probation for another 3 years. I understand what I did was against the law and feel grateful for having my sentenced reduced but depression is setting in...

I was arrested in august of 2011 for drug trafficking and battled the case until Jan of 2013, during that time I was living southwest florida, attending school fulltime, maintained a steady job, started my own business and was able to do whatever I wanted, without any restriction.

I was never addicted to drugs so thankfully I am not facing that battle but just before my final hearing on Jan 14th I moved back home to Tampa to live with my parents while on house arrest.

Every decent IT postion I have interviewed for I lost solely due to my PO officer, despite being asked back for multiple interviews and having a clean background.

My parents are extremely understand of my situation and respect that I have assumed all responsibility from lawyer costs and fees, staying clean and social implications. I moved home strictly because SWFL is nothing but drug infested and I needed out, somewhere above the influence for Tampa isn't proving to be any better.

Please help me.,6,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/17te8b/my_sister_is_dealing_with_crippling_alcoholism/,"So this will be a bit of a rant, I apologize. First I should mention that my entire family, both sides, are alcoholics. Between my parents they have 16 siblings in all, both sides drink heavily. 
Around the holidays I have the joy to find out that my sister is dealing with a REALLY bad case of alcoholism. (think 22 bottles of rum over two months by herself) I tried to give her an intervention and the next day on Christmas I got the joy of outing her to my parents. She agreed that she had a problem and wanted help with it, but she refuses to take money from my parents (who are MORE than willing to support her but she has self-esteem issues that run deep.)

So fast forward to last week, shes on the track to move out and start therapy and get her life in shape, and she totals her car while driving drunk. This is the second time shes been CAUGHT driving drunk but the first time was from a friend and there were virtually no consequences. They made her go to Rehab which she promptly blew off. This time shes getting court charges. 

I'm angry because every time she says she wants to get better, she goes right back into the bottle and starts with the ""oh woe is me"" mindset. Its  bs because we have very caring, but ignorant to the truth, parents who would do anything for her. We were brought up with little to no problems but she constantly makes excuses for herself (""its no wonder im an alcoholic, just look at where we came from!"") which is also bs because I barely drink at all. 

I'm mostly angry that my grandparents are putting up a good sum of money to get her a lawyer for the court charges. I may be a terrible person, but unless she gets tangible consequences then this will never end. And I don't mean the whole spiel about ""you could die from this."" Her and I will always bet against could, its in our nature.

I have no idea what to do, I'm states away from her and it makes me angry just to think about it. I'm all about second chances but I don't know if she deserves one. She's my blood, so of course I love her but I get so frustrated by being told one thing and having her go right back to square one the next week.

I'm in my second term of university, and I feel alone. I'm actually quite socially capable, frequently up for going out/just talking with people. I also feel I'm reasonably well liked. Last Monday, my best friend of university took a year of absence, and since then I've barely been out. In first term, I was out drinking or just chilling with people at least several times a week, but without the absent friend I feel as though I've lost my direct social link. I actually have many friends here, but they're at a more superficial level, and it's hard to cross that barrier into “person you go out with / hang out with regularly”, particularly in guy to guy friendships.  I have a very tight knit, large and dedicated friendship group back home which is probably making my experience now more acutely felt, I'm not used to “feeling slightly adrift” in a social context, as I've grown up with it as a concrete certainty. This feeling is exacerbated by my living quarters, where I hang out near exclusively with my flat (it's a building of six flats).

I feel that I can become friends with nearly everyone given the interaction, I'm just finding it difficult to initiate (""just put yourself out there"" is the obvious mantra, but it's the ""how"" that gets me).

I suppose it all started whenever I met this girl. We both worked at Legoland Florida when it was first opening up. I sat down, talked to her and its like we never stopped talking. I really started to like this girl. She liked all of the same off-the-wall things that I did. I constantly found myself saying ""Where have you been all of my life."" She tells me that she is interested in one of our leads. We were both 18, he was 27. I hated the idea of it.  The two of them become friends with benefits and she tells me she found out he was 36. She doesn't seem to care though, she keeps fucking him.

After a little while she starts ""cheating"" on him with me. I had no idea what I was supposed to do. All of my friends tell me to leave her alone and move on. So I did. After about 3 weeks she tells me that she ended things with our lead and that she misses me a lot. I was so happy, we got together 2 days later.

All we did was work, and then hang out with each other for a year and a half. She didn't like the fact that I had so many friends that were girls and she would get really jealous whenever I hung out with them. So I stopped. So now, one year, and one returned engagement ring later. I realized that we would fight all of the time and I was torturing myself while I was with her.

I come to find out that she is juggling 4 guys. Now all of these thoughts are racing through my head. I feel used, worthless, and lonely.

I have always been highly intelligent, but I am a procrastinator and lack the ability to motivate myself. You could probably call this lazy. I excelled in high school, but in my senior year I developed a crippling case of senioritis that has, if anything, only gotten worse - either that or it is of the same severity and just a much uglier condition in someone who is no longer of high school age. 

I went to Stony Brook University after high school with no idea what I wanted to do with my life - an answer to a question which still eludes me. Eventually, I decided to major in political science. However, the aforementioned senioritis or lack of motivation or laziness or whatever derailed my schooling and saw me booted from the school. I went to a local community college where I obtained an associates degree in liberal arts and returned to the university to finish my bachelor's. With one semester left, my student loans ran out and I left school. I meant to return, but never have. Finances are an issue there.

The summer after high school, I got a crap job at a local small business. I have been there ever since. I run the whole place and am quite good at it - but it is a struggling business and I make less than $30,000 a year despite spending more than a decade there. 

Not to sound brash, but I am one of the smartest people I know, I can learn almost anything and I am a dedicated and loyal employee. However, I'm over thirty with no specific skills, other than customer service. I have decent knowledge of computers, but not enough to find employment in that field. My associates in liberal arts and schooling in political science certainly doesn't make me suited for any particular vocation. Craigslist, Monster, CareerBuilder, etc. has been no help in finding a career.

I believe that I have the tools to excel in life, but instead I am languishing in a crappy apartment with a dead-end job just trying to make the bills.

I'm a guy, who is in teenage years.

I've always loved and appreciated different and out-of-ordinary stuff. Recently, I started shaving my legs after I tried it once and loved the appearence and feel of my legs.

I would like a dark, black Bow Tie on my lower back and I think I would wear it proudly, but I can't seem to understand why. It's so feminine, yet so inviting. I want it but no one can see it because they will think it's ridiculous. I would cover and hide it, but then, what's the point of having such a weird, absurd tattoo?

I'm the only guy doing just the MSc and not the PhD, and the course itself has very rigorous entry standards as well as a very tough workload.

There is no point beating around the bush here, but everyone else on my course is pretty much better than me at most things. I've come to the course with the least qualifications (compared to my colleagues) and I take more time to pick up concepts. I've also never been good at coursework, and even in my undergrad degree where I got really high marks, it was because of my great exams despite my consistently below average coursework marks.

I'm typically the guy who gets 5-15% lower than most people, and I'm pretty sure with my exam marks coming out soon that I won't have done too well. But every single day I beat myself up for it, and the less confidence I have in myself the worse I get at doing my degree. My brain starts to hesitate more and I start to become quieter and less vocal about my opinions.

I hate to see myself becoming like this. I have good days where I'm confident and I really feel like I'm contributing in group discussions, and that people do value my thoughts. But on most days I feel really bad, and I convince myself my colleagues and professors think I'm dumb, and that I'm not cut out for this course.

The real kicker is that the majority of people who did this MSc in the past are expected to get the highest band mark (so imagine the marks could be A/B/C/D - most people end with an A) - but it looks like I'm more of a B guy.

What can I do to just stop *caring* all the time? I want to enjoy my degree and look upon it fondly, I want to stop caring about the fact I'm not scoring as high as everyone else, and I just want to take it at my own pace.

I’m not the biggest partier, so it was insane for me. They kept asking if I wanted to drink (and though I wanted to) I couldn’t because I had to drive home. I was really awkward, and I couldn’t dance or socialize like I normally do. I was the living embodiment of the socially awkward penguin. The school is REALLY small, so I feel like I made a terrible first impression. I just wasn’t used to the body shots, opening doors and seeing people having sex, and the peppiness. Not that I’m condemning them in any way. I’m not religious, and I get that they were having fun. This whole thing is my problem, not theirs. Something is wrong with me. I’m used to hanging around people that sit in circles, smoke weed and drink beers. This one guy at the party asked me why I was so chill. Greek life is really big in this school.

I tried asking this in the relationship thread, but got no response. It's long winded and I hope I don't sound too ranty. So here goes:

I can't stand my parents. There I said it. I am 26, married and I just found out my husband and i are having a baby. Growing up my dad was a mean drunk who paid little attention to me or my siblings unless we were in trouble. I am the middle child of three kids. My mother treated me like her best friend until I mouthed off then she would sell me out to drunk dad and I'd get the shit kicked out of me. She would then swoop in and be a friend again. Once I got older, I basically became a glorified housekeeper. My mother took advantage of my anxiety and OCD to get me to clean the house. Looking back, my mother was depressed and very lazy. She didn't want to make the effort to make her own friends, so I was her ""little mini-me."" I didn't notice until she would become become very jealous and mean to my school friends. It was weird.

Anyway, I went away to college and basically was ignored by my parents for three years. I moved away from home with my then-boyfriend my junior year. I have since married the then-boyfriend and we live about forty minutes away. They pretty much left us alone until we got dogs.

Now my parents will not leave us alone. They want us to come over all the time and bring the dogs. They clearly only want to spend time with my freaking dogs. When we do go to my parent's house, we sit around while our dogs get better treatment then I ever did as a child. They call all the time too: ""when are you coming over, when can we see the dogs, come over for dinner; we miss the dogs...blah blah""

After gently telling them to back off, I finally had to tell my sister to tell them to stop pestering us. My mother's response was for us to ""suck it up.""

Now we're having a child and I am petrified to tell them. I know the minute we tell them they will be grandparents, they will dial up the pestering. I'm also scared sh*tless that I will turn out just like my parents.

The whole situation just irks me and I'm not sure how to proceed in dealing with it. What do I do from here on out? Do I set some ground rules? How do I do that without coming across as a bitch?

It's a fairly simple backstory; my parents hooked up as teenagers, had a shotgun wedding, and divorced when I was still a baby. I think the last time my mother was in the same state as I during a birthday was my second. As far as I know, she's only celebrated my first birthday with me. The last time she visited me was my eighth grade graduation. Now, she's coming up to celebrate my sixteenth birthday, ""because it's important.""

She only comes up to celebrate what she thinks is important. This really bothers me because she's just a finish-line parent, able to brag that I won the race but not helping me train for it. When I heard she was coming up, my first reaction was, ""Was fifteen not important? Fourteen? Two?"" 

She has never been there for me. I'm by no means calling her a bad person; just, perhaps, a bad mother. I remember being forced as a child to talk to her on the phone. ""Who is this woman?"" I wondered. ""What am I supposed to say?""

I feel a lot of pressure from family when it comes to her. I honestly feel like a terrible person; what person doesn't love their mother? But when I think of her coming up, I feel anxious. Before eighth grade graduation, I was suffering from depression. I was already harming myself, but then I felt even more anxious by her and she was definitely a contributor. 

I'm luckily over the depression, (well, as ""over"" as one can get...I still feel it, but I'm improving.) but she's making me anxious again. Not only that, I'm making myself feel worse. 

I cannot go on living like this. I can honestly say I would not mind if I never saw her again, but I'm scared to kick her out of my life. She's my mother, after all. What mother wants to hear that their child doesn't love her? What if it's the worst decision I could make? I tried talking to my grandmother (my custodial guardian), and all she said was to keep my heart open to my mother. 

The thing is, I kept my heart open for sixteen years. I know she's not perfect, and again, I don't think she's a bad person. But she hurts me, constantly. Emotionally. Which to me, is the worst. I can withstand physical abuse...but I've been broken and this reopens wounds. 

There are just too many questions. ""Is she only visiting and calling because she feels obligated? When people ask how many kids she has, does she say four or five?"" 

The thing is, I don't want to know how she'll react. She's driving up here, for hours...only to learn I've never wanted her here. And then what if someone asks how many kids she has? ""Five, but one of them hates me""? 

I know I need to tell her how I feel, but it is breaking my heart. Maybe I have too much empathy. But basically, I just need some support...and I need help knowing what to say. I want to stay calm and not start crying, and I don't want her to feel like shit.

I'm a real asshole. A lot. My mother is prone to rash, irresponsible decisions that tend to blow up.
I will also point out that I work almost full time (~35hrs/week), go to school (4hrs/day 5days/week), and since I'm transgender, tend to my dysphoria and transition. She works full time, and goes to school on line during the week.

My mom made the decision we're moving. That's not my problem. She decided we were going to move in with an older gay male who she has known for roughly three months. She's not only breaking our lease, but he is her coworker. A little bit of background knowledge: My mom had made the decision years ago to move into one of her friend's houses that they owned. That friend went crazy, and we ended up on the streets after only a few months. 
She thought I'd be okay with this because he's gay.as if in my head being gay was the same as not having the ability to be a bad person. 
The similarities between these decisions: 

1. She didn't talk to me about either decision, and with the credibilities I stated before, I think I'd have a say.

2. She didn't tell me until it was already too late.

3. She knows both of these people personally, and it's a really bad idea to mix business and private. 

I told her I'm extremely uncomfortable with this, and then, after we both cooled down, she calls me and guilts me. She told me she'd ask for the money back and she didn't want to be torn apart from me, and she loved me. 
I know. She sounds like a monster right now, but she isn't. She just makes really bad decisions a lot. 
She then gave the decision to me, and I'm left with three choices.

Option one: Move in with the guy I'm extremely uncomfortable with.

Option two: Let her move in with him and go my own way.

Option 3. Have her stay at the house we're at. 

Problem with option two is I would most likely get fucked over, or be a burden. Even though I can pay rent, I'd still be burdening someone with the legal possibility of being fucked. Then, I'd be forced into option 1. 

Problem with option three: We're not compatible at all. I mean more than the average teenage boy with his mother. I've lived in a shelter before because we weren't able to handle each other. Cops have been called. I have a strong feeling we'd just end up doing it all over again. 

I don't like option one because not only do I barely know him, but he's an asshole. I have a really bad feeling, and I really do think this will explode. 
I think option three is the best immediate. I'll probably tell her to wait until the lease is up (September) and then we make this decision.

I have a child who as a 12 year old committed a crime and as a 16 year old his crime became known and he was prosecuted.  He was sentenced to probation dependent upon therapy and community service.  The therapy has various levels and projects that need to be completed for each level.  He has to appear in court approximately every 3 months for a progress report.  He has been in therapy for at least 1.5 years.  His progress in therapy has stopped.  On average others have completed similar treatment by now and he is at one forth of the way done.  

I've tried reasoning with him.  I've had others try to reason with him.  He is not even attempting to work on any project.  I've taken away every excuse he has come up with by solving it to his satisfaction.  He will not specify why he has stopped working.

Knowing the 2 great motivators are pain and pleasure I've tried setting up a simple, clear and significant reward system.  I've attempted to get him to link the things he is missing out on being in the juvenile legal system and how completing therapy and community service are his tickets to freedom.

Discussions I've tried are:

1.  Having him tell me best and worst case scenarios on what will happen if there is no progress when we return to court.

2.  The possible affects on his adult life with a felony on his record (this assumes his juvenile record is not public).

3.  Even though the therapy could not possibly fix a problem that no longer exists he must play the game to end it.  I gave the example of Army drill Sergeants in boot camp.

4.  If he is incarcerated on his next court appearance he will be 18 and could enter the adult detention system.

He is a smart kid (smarter than I am), honest and with anger issues.

I'm out of ideas.  I can see no reasonable path that does not involve jail for him.  My next steps are to tell my son when judge asks me for an update on his therapy...  tell the truth.  Tell him he has given me little to work with in his defense.  A few weeks before his next court appearance have him box up his possessions (I'd like to move in the next year) and the week before his court appearance bring home all his school possessions as well as having him settle all debts/loans with family and friends under the assumption he going to prison.

Intellectually, I know it's his life and he will reap the benefits and consequences of his actions as it should be.  Like any other parent I want the best for my child.  Even if he lives a life far below his abilities or gives up altogether (suicide) at least I can say to myself, I tried to the best of my ability, explored every reasonable option and tried every reasonable resource to help my son.

In my experience, it's nearly impossible to help someone that does not want help... which is where I find myself with someone I love.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Update:  

I talked with my son and his therapist a day ago.  I told them both that there is one month left before the next court appointment.  I told them both I had no doubt if there is was not major progress he will be going to jail.  I told the therapist I didn't expect him to ""pass off"" the assignments, but I'd like him to determine the resistance and deal with that.  I told them both how I felt and my short and medium range concerns.  I told them how I was more than confident that he would be less likely to re-offend than the average person to initially offend and why.  I attempted to express my love for my son and fear if he does not alter his path.  He surprised me by turning in an assignment, but it's far from enough.

His therapist assured me it's still possible for him to complete everything except the final test (which is outside his control) within the month to advance to the next level.",,False,,t5_2qjdm,1356163453.0,,,True,t3_156ku9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/156ku9/unmotivated_son_at_a_critical_time_in_his_life/,

Will it make a difference?",7,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14lc1n/a_letter_to_my_father_and_maybe_all_of_my_family/,"A little background here;I am a MtF transsexual, 31 years old. In June of 2011 I came out as trans(sexual) to my parents, and was promptly told that ""so long as you choose to continue down this path, you choose to no longer be a part of my life.""
I continued to write to my father in hopes that I could appeal to his better side -- all of which were answered by articles from the Vatican and NARTH ""proving"" himself ""right,"" or with silence. I was invited to the family holiday gathering last year, to which I wrote a nice thank you letter that also expressed my desire to spend more time with him. Silence. It has been nearly a year since that Christmas with no invitation in sight - no shock there. I write letters to my dad, even though I don't intend on sending them, a form of therapy for me I suppose. I wrote this one today and it kind of surprised me; so I ask reddit, as a first time poster, should I sent this letter to my father and/or to all of my family? Please, share your opinion and suggestions.

Letter begins:
&gt;Dear Dad,
&gt;
&gt;Merry Christmas! This time of year is full of season's tidings and goodwill towards mankind; a time of year where we set aside our differences, forigve offenses, and where family and friends gather together in love and harmony to share this special time with those who matter most: family. Family can &gt;be best described as a group of people who love each other, and are loved in return, in spite of ourselves and our differences. Truly, there is no &gt;other time of year where such focus and energy is spent to drive this point into the forefront of our consciousness. Yet it seems so easily forgotten &gt;at times, doesn't it?
&gt;
&gt;All of this awe-inspiring and downright beautiful display of humanity at it's finest; the ability to love and forgive in spite of ourselves is truly the &gt;greatest quality we mere mortals are blessed with. Our compassion comes as a close second. We are all human, we are all flawed, and no two are &gt;exactly alike. We all have major and minor differences, yet we are all the same: we are human, and we all have family.
&gt;
&gt;That is, unless you are a transsexual, gay, lesbian, bi, or even straight and an atheist, or of some faith other than your family. Perhaps you married &gt;outside your family's ethnicity or culture. These are the most often cited reasons for no longer being included in one's family -- almost in that exact &gt;order, from my experience thus far, anyhow. 
&gt;
&gt;So with this season and all the beauty and good it brings out in all of us, stop for a moment and look at everyone present; more importantly, look at &gt;who is missing. Ask yourself why is that person absent? Are the holidays really about family, love, forgiveness, and togetherness in spite of who we &gt;are -- warts and all? Conversely, is it really only about the family that thinks alike and believes alike? Is it right that I am here when my brother, &gt;sister, or relative is denied their family? Perhaps, with all the beauty this season brings out in us, it also brings out our worst as well -- and it can be &gt;very ugly.
&gt;
&gt;The important distinction to make is that, unlike your absent relative, sibling, or child, you have a choice: make this season a beautiful one, make &gt;being human, and humanity beautiful.
&gt;
&gt;I love you Dad, and I forgive you.
&gt;
&gt;Merry Christmas,
&gt;
&gt;Me

So there you have it. Love it or hate it, should I send it or not? To my father? To all my family? Should I shred it and burn it in effigy instead?

1354947435.0,3,self.Advice,14hkkb,I feel like a failure,6,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14hkkb/i_feel_like_a_failure/,"First of all I should state that I'm a bit older at 28 and that my family background is middle upper class just to add some background and context.  Please be prepared for a wall of text and write whatever feedback you want.  Any criticism is constructive criticism and I know at times this may come off across as first world problems.

I feel like a complete and utter fucking failure in life and that I'm behind my peers for being single, underemployed, and haven't bought my first house yet.  Four years ago I was fresh out of a prestigious university with a good job to teach English overseas, hopefully getting a better non teaching job after a few months, and be with the girl of my dreams whom I had met studying abroad and was dating long distance.  

Unfortunately once that first half year was in, my father unexpectedly passed away.  So needless to say that's quite the life changing event.  This was something I definitely didn't need especially when I was trying to get my own, adult life on track separate from that of my family.  I was able to tough it out for a few more months I thought, but the pressures of having to worry about my family back home combined with the depression that brought on gave me problems at work and with my relationship.  

After another tumultuous year my girlfriend had enough of my bullshit (To be honest I think I would be too if I were in her shoes) and dumped me right before I moved back home, as I had simply just had enough of my job and other issues that were going on at the time.  Honestly in hindsight I just felt like I was on ""autopilot"" the whole time and I was a powder keg just waiting to explode.  Even the littlest tasks that I can complete now would take me forever to get motivated to do, in fact I lost my motivation for a lot of things in my life, which I honestly don't think I should have.  Instead I think should have just bottled everything up and continue like nothing had changed in my life and stay the course.  I'm man enough to admit that there were days where I'd just sit at home and mope/cry yet as a man I feel ashamed to admit or having done that when I shouldn't have in the first place.

Upon moving back home I was able to get an ok-ish sales job which I unfortunately got laid off from after a month of working there.  Thankfully I've had enough money saved up until that point to live off of.  What really sucked though is this is when I started to really grieve about my father passing away, and I entered a pretty deep funk/depression for a year about everything just going to shit in my life that took me a while to get out of.  I managed to get a part-time job and started learning comp sci as I can't get a job with my previous skill set.  After about 10 months of this I was able to stop feeling so depressed but now instead of being sad about myself and everything I'm just angry.  Angry, yet motivated.

I just get so pissed off at myself for not being on the same level as the people I went to school with on facebook and from talking to them.  Despite having gone to a prestigious university I feel like a fuck up for not having a good job or being in graduate school.  Despite having lived overseas and achieving (Yet not following through on) a childhood dream I had that fail on me, and I especially feel pissed off looking at people I know that are still there on facebook.  And these feelings don't just stay restricted to other Americans - I can read a magazine article about people my age living in Shanghai or New Dehli and feel the same rage since I judge them for being ahead of me as well.  I am quite aware of income disparities between other countries and relative standards of living.  A party official's son in China I would judge to be a good existence.  Despite living in a 5,000 square foot house with a parent that I actually get along with I feel like some fuck up manchild for not being out on my own like everyone else.  Despite my father passing I feel like I have no excuse for failure in spite of everything  and that I should do even better in spite of that.  I've recently decided to start dating again but now I'm getting nagging feelings that nobody is going to want to date me for being a loser who's behind the game.

One of the only good things to come out of all of this is I'm at least not fat anymore - that's the one thing I've been able to control and I've stayed absolutely consistent with.  In two years I've gone from a probable 30% body fat to 12.2%, a weight drop from 210 to 170, substantial increase in muscle, and I don't mean to brag when I say that I look fucking great especially for my age.  I don't think it needs to be said it feels great to be wanted by a lot of the opposite sex for the first time in your life.  People who haven't met me in the longest time are completely shocked.  I've also realized what I want to do with my life and what field I want to study but once again I feel like I'm behind everyone else, like I was supposed to have all of this shit all figured out and just be on an escalator in life.  I feel so self-conscious for having started programming at 27 when I should have been learning and doing this stuff when I was 16.  I feel dumber than the other people I took/take (Took the semester off to self study - I also built my first gaming PC 1.5 months ago)  programming classes with for having a double major degree in social sciences and liberal arts. 

I also get sick of people telling me how smart I am for where I went to school, or how it was an accomplishment with living overseas.  In my eyes and by standards I'm a complete and utter fuck up especially in not following through on that last one and moving back to the United States.  Sometimes I feel hostile/overly aggressive to other people especially men and I don't know what to make of that.  In fact, I'd say a good comparison to how I carry myself would be Ryan Gosling in Drive - I especially sympathize with that movie, There Will Be Blood, and Apocalypse Now.  All of the protagonists of these excellent films just speak to my soul I hate to say.  I'm developing these warped hyper-competitive views that I'm just feeling more and more compelled to follow through on to ""make up"" and I don't know whether that's good or bad.  I sometimes think it's poisoning all of my relationships with people that I have to be doing better than them.  Somehow someway I find a way to judge them as being ahead of me.

I'm a twenty one year old guy who's currently living with his mother. I'm in a bit of an unfortunate situation, in that I more or less live in the middle of nowhere and lack a car. I had a job for awhile and things were just sort of going along, but it didn't end up working out and I lost that. There aren't really many other opportunities for me, and I can't stay where I am much longer as I'll be booted out to the street in a few months. Not to mention a plethora of other reasons want me to get the hell out of here and make something of myself.

For the longest time I've aspired to move out to a big city on the west coast (which will remain anonymous for the time being), but I'm still a bit worried about making it happen. I have about $2000 to my name to make it work, so I'm going to have a pretty small window to get by.

I figure I'd try and find a room to rent in some one's house, or a cheap extended stay hotel to stay in and immediately hit the streets to find any job I can. Just sort of go from there and hope things work out. I know it's going to be rough, but I feel like it's my best option at this point. I do have a friend out in the area who's willing to help me get my feet on the ground, but there's no way I could trouble him with giving me a roof over my head or anything along those lines.

That being said, do you guys have any advice for me? Helpful tips that might help me get by over the coming months? Anything, really. Even words of encouragement would be great.

1354664784.0,5,self.Advice,14agp1,My boyfriend's paycheck is 3 weeks late and we don't know what to do.,5,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14agp1/my_boyfriends_paycheck_is_3_weeks_late_and_we/,"My boyfriend recently was hired through a job agency called Manpower. They found him work with Cash 4 Junk Cars (which bought out Pick N Pull) and he's halfway through his fourth week of work now.

Now technically, since Manpower is a job agency, until Pick N Pull hires him on full time, he is employed directly through Manpower itself. As a result, they are supposed to be paying him weekly. I say ""supposed to"" because he has yet to receive even one paycheck.

The first week, they gave everyone log in information so that they could log in to the system and clock their hours at the end of the week. Thursday, my boyfriend went to do this, and was told that his log in information was invalid. He attempted to reset his password, and never received the email that was supposed to reset it. He attempted to call and get help. ""The only person who can help you is at lunch, she'll call you later"". She never did.

The next day, lather, rinse repeat. This goes on for a week. Finally he is given a different number to call; the corporate office. He calls them. They act horrified, say they will resolve it as quickly as possible. The woman who he'd been trying to get ahold of for a week finally called him back, saying ""Why didn't you call or email me?"". ...he did.

She decides that, since he's having such a difficult time getting his log in information to work, she'll enter his time sheet for him. ""It should be approved within 24 to 48 hours.""

It wasn't.

So he calls back. ""Oh, the person who does the approvals won't be in again until Tuesday"". ...it's Thursday (of his third week at work) now.

He mentions that he's running out of money to get to work, and has no idea what to do now. She then FINALLY says ""Oh, well we can send you a money gram, call this number"". He calls.

""The cut off time for money grams is 4 pm"". (It's 4:02 pm) ""But... I guess we can make an exception. We'll only be able to get you half of the sum we owe you for your first week, though.""

So we got the money gram and were told that his paycheck would arrive Tuesday. Fast forward to today.

We've budgeted well, even though our car only gets 12 to 15 miles per gallon and his work is easily 20 miles away. (He works sundays so it's been five days of work now since the money gram).

The money still isn't there.

He calls in and is told that they need to ""research the difficulties around the account"", and that it would be ""expedited"", but that he will be payed Friday at the latest now.

We can't do this again. They say another Money Gram is out of the option, and he can't get to work tomorrow.

Reddit, what are our rights here? He's waiting on a call back from the company, but he is one step away from calling the labor commission board and filing a complaint.

(It might work if you temporarily disable one, but I'm not sure.)

As most of you know, earlier this year Verizon made it so that grandfathered in unlimited data users are required to move to a shared data plan. I wasn't looking forward to this change when I went in to get the Droid DNA last week. When the lady at Verizon came back she told me I had used 18 GB already (idk how) and I was only 3 weeks into the month. She went back to ""see if she could do anything for me"", and when she returned this is what she told me:

Because I had a line on our account that wasn't being used, I was able to move my upgrade from my phone to the disabled one. Then when the disabled line is upgraded to the new phone that you want, your plan does not need to change. (something to do with the fact that it's not being used.) You might be able to temporarily disable a line in order to do this, and then re-activate it afterwards, but I'm not sure. Then all you need to do is ask to switch the phone numbers of your phone and the disabled one. BOOM, new phone same unlimited data plan.

This worked for me last week and it was actually suggested to me by an employee. Just wanted to share it.

What should I do?",8,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13o2oq/my_girlfriend_was_sexually_abused_by_her_brother/,"Ok so I've known this girl for 4 years, and we've only recently started dating. We were best friends before we started dating and I told her so much about my life and so did she. For example, during this previous summer, she had a problem with cutting herself. She said it was because of issues with her dad, feeling like she could never please him. I helped her get over this phase in her life by teaching her to find strength in herself, and that she didn't have to please everyone else to be happy.
Only recently, though, she let me know that she had been sexually abused by her brother on two different occasions. One when she was about 4, and another when she was 8 or 9. She's 16, now, and he's 20.
Now I never particularly liked this guy, he was never there for her when she was having hard times this summer, and always said ""he wished he could be there more."" Her dad had kicked him out of the house a few years ago, and even though I'm afraid to ask, I'm pretty sure I know the reason.
It bugs me because she acts like they've gotten over all their problems and are just like every other brother and sister out there, but they've both out themselves in denial about this happening. She's slept at his house before, and come home wearing his clothes. Even though nothing bad happened, I'm just concerned for her safety. Tonight he just picked her up from her parents' house without warning to take her shopping. I don't think her parents even know it happened. It got me really wondering exactly how long they can keep this little charade up.
I can't talk to the parents about it, because honestly they're nut jobs.
I want her to seek professional help, because it's already caused a few problems in our relationship (she rushed into the physical aspect too quickly, and then tried to rail back on it and make boundaries, which we've kept rather well. That was when she told me about the whole thing). She would never go to a professional, her parents wouldn't either because they're also in denial about this whole thing happening.
She told me that she had pretty much repressed everything until she ""felt the same way after making out with me in the back seat of my car as she did after everything happened when she was young."" That instantly instilled fear into me because the last thing I want is for her to associate me with feelings of being molested. I backed off physically, so we only kiss lightly and don't do any of the heavy making out or grouping.
I would do anything for her. I've had plenty of other girlfriends but didn't care about any of them like I do her. I'm actually having thoughts of marriage with this girl, so I want to help her with this. I don't trust her brother, but she like idolizes him. She doesn't really show any other signs of problems except for what I've said, and she hasn't really told anyone else that's willing to talk to her about it and help her get through it. 
So what do I do? Do I try and talk to her about her brother? Should I talk to her brother? Should I just sit back and hope for the best or what?",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_13o2oq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/13o2oq/my_girlfriend_was_sexually_abused_by_her_brother/,

Some background:

I am currently at a private university with a hefty price tag. My parents are unable to help me pay for school, so my plan was to have them co-sign personal loans that I would pay off post-graduation. When I made college decisions, my thought was that I should pursue the best possible education so that job opportunities would be easier to find and the degree would pay for itself. Unfortunately, recent family issues have created a financial situation for my parents where they will no longer be able to co-sign loans for me. I have to find another way to pay for my education. I am more than willing to take on a full time job (or two if necessary) to pay my way through school. I'm earning A's in my classes at this point so scholarship money could be another way to make the numbers work. However, I will most definitely need to find a less expensive school.

Fast forward to this afternoon. A professor (who is aware of my financial situation and intention to transfer) expressed to me that she would sincerely like for me to stay at the current university. She offered me a paid position working as her assistant on a project of hers and hinted that should I speak with the financial aid office there may be some assistance for me. She also commented on my academic abilities and potential in the future. This is an incredible opportunity. It would be fantastic on a transcript and this is a highly sought after position. Under normal circumstances I would have crumpled to my knees and expressed my undying love, however the job and financial aid would not be enough to cover my expenses for next year. I would still be in the situation where I would have to either work nights in the town where the school is (it's not a wealthy town. I don't think a job would be easy if even possible to find not to mention that I don't have transportation on campus) or find some way to get a co-signer. I'm going to have to transfer no matter what.

Which presents me with a question. Is it appropriate for me to take the position as the professor's assistant knowing full well that A) I will not be back next year and B) there is a chance that my current financial situation is a contributing factor in the position being offered in the first place?

We recently had a child, and everything is going well, but...every time she gets a job she become *insufferable*. I think it may have always been this way.. but I don't know what we can do about this. 

 When we first got together, she babysat for her mother, against her will, and had been for a couple of years. Made her quit high school and everything. She has had a fast food job, which she apparently did rather well at, but had quit it when her mom got pregnant and ""asked"" her to stay and babysit afterwards. 

She moved in with me a year into our relationship, and three months later got a job at a diner, one which my best friend got her, and she started off on midnight shift. Our relationship started going to hell at that point, mainly because I worked an afternoon shift, and immediately upon getting home, she'd be leaving. Immediately upon getting up, she'd be going to sleep. When I did get to see her she was *constantly* angry.
 Now, I had known since a month or so after we got together that I happened to be dating crazy, but dating this crazy was worth it. When she isn't crazy, she's extremely compassionate, brilliant, and the nicest person, and the most self-aware crazy I've ever met. 
When we both realized that this pattern was going to ruin our relationship, she switched shifts. We started doing better, but she was still absolutely stressed all the time. Her bosses were making her work for free, and they'd call her in almost every other day, and never pay her overtime. 
Months later we had an accident, and she got pregnant. She was already coming home almost every other night crying about something new. She quit her job when her bosses finally basically jumped on her and told her she was the worst employee, etc., just an attack on her already absolutely mentally frail pregnant mind. (Luckily, a week later, the boss was caught embezzling, and was fired.) 

So she was jobless. Looked for jobs throughout her pregnancy. Upon having the baby, we agreed that it was probably better for her to stay at home, because it'd be the same amount in money she'd make to get a babysitter. So, my 9$  an hour is having to make it through our month.  But then one our neighbors asked her to some cleaning as he was an extremely disgusting hoarder veteran with one leg, and constantly sickly. So she went down there every morning, and since he was angry at the world for his being extremely lonely, he'd sit down there and berate her the entire time. So she'd come home an explode. Would yell, scream, and just blow up at every other sentence that would come out of my mouth. She noticed it as well, and asked what she should do, so I advised her to quit, and she did. Everything went back to normal.    

Now she's cleaning another neighbors house. Our child is 7 months old now, and she's able to bring him with her, and do it at her own pace, and it's already pretty clean, but she is *still* upset. She starts getting angry and starts having basic panic attacks after anything goes wrong. She wants to help out, she gets frustrated without a job, and starts going on about feeling like a burden, but I almost like her more when she doesn't have one at all. I'd rather be broke than her be like that. She really does get pretty crazy.

It's never really been a big thing with me that she needs a job, but my mom and a couple of friends think this isn't a good idea, that she should stop breastfeeding and get a babysitter, they tell me they'll babysit for free, and they know places where she could get hired on. They also have no idea what she's like. Otherwise, my dad is good with it, agrees with the ""babysitter is a dumb idea"", but he's also incredibly traditional and would rather her be a housewife anyways.
 I just don't know what to do. She *wants* to work, and I kinda do too, the extra money would be nice, but when she is, she's absolutely terrible to be around.

I am on my 20s and I been living in the United States as an foreign student. I have been having a lot of problems here, and I have completely isolated myself from everyone I knew, feeling very depressed about being away from home and it started affecting my grades. I was a 4.0 student and now I can't barely pass my classes, which I ended up dropping during this semester to try and figure things out better.

I believe one of the roots of my problem is that I don't enjoy, and feel uncomfortable around people that us illegal substances or drink heavily which seems to be the norm for everyone my age here. My girlfriend also works with and is friends with many people that don't see drug use as particularly serious, however drugs are a deal breaker for me.

While she tells me she hasn't tried anything I don't know why she wouldn't because she doesn't see her friends as harmful as I do. It started to take a toll on us being together and I cannot bring the subject up or she gets very angry and defensive.

 I was tolerant of it before, I did spent time with drug users here in the United States, I realize that they weren't capable of being good friends to me (all they did was drug related, would hit on my girlfriend, pressure me to use drugs...) and left. Since then I lost all my respect for people that use drugs, and try to state clearly to anyone I meet I am not ok with it.

But now I feel isolated and depressed due to having no friends apart from my girlfriend, and having my family being two days traveling by plane away. Even here on reddit I drugs are seem as positive.

It has been slowly eating me away until that I now am depressed and things that I always looked forward to I dont anymore (I loved school but now I dont know why I am here, feel like everyone is a drug user or think it is ok because to how when the subject comes up they admit to have tried/using drugs from cocaine to weed.

The first picture is a copy of the insurance policy. It specifically states it applies for ""covered perils other than hurricane-force winds from a hurricane named by the National Weather Service."" At first glance it looks like, well shit.


But here is where it gets interesting and I'm hoping I even have a case.
The 5pm advisory still has the storm as a hurricane http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/al18/al182012.discus.030.shtml?

Somewhere between the 5pm advisory and the 11pm advisory the stormed ceased being a hurricane and made a transition to a ""post-tropical cyclone"" They even share that it happened before landfall approximately 8pm.


The NHC advisory at 11pm last evening specifically states. ""THE INTENSITY OF THE POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 80 KT AT LANDFALL WITH A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 946 MB."" That link can be found at http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/al18/al182012.discus.031.shtml?


The Weather Channel and Weather.com shares that Sandy made landfall approximately 8pm near Atlantic City. http://www.weather.com/news/weather-hurricanes/sandy-top-five-20121028


Now. I only know the approximate time that the big part of the tree fell. About 7:30pm. I know this from text messages sent out and my mom's posting on Facebook saying that it just happened so there is documentation stating it happened around that time. Technically the event happened before it made landfall, but now did this happen before or after it had made the the transition to post tropical cyclone and was no longer a hurricane.

My argument is that it was not actually a hurricane when it hit. The policy specifically states that the hurricane force winds ""from a hurricane.""

I don't mean just love, I mean statues, posters, pillows, stuffed animals, ect. ect. She fucking adores them. Anyway, my wife, and her mother, died last year on September 22, which is four days before my daughter's birthday. 

I woke my daughter up at 6 am and told her that her mom had died. She looked at me, got up, walked into the living room (the hospital bed was there), looked at her, and hugged her one last time. She then gathered her four cats together, piled them in her room, turned off the light, and went back to sleep. Not a single tear.

Fast forward to about five hours ago. Her cat had kittens about five weeks ago and it  was time for them to go. One of her teachers were getting one, so after school she took the kitten in and gave it to her. 

When she came back out, I swear to God I wanted to die. She was sobbing uncontrollably. Her eyes were red and puffy, she walked in dream-like slowness. She spent the entire car-ride just staring at the dashboard. As soon as we got home she went to her room, shut the door, and hasn't come out yet.

I can't figure her out, she did't cry for her mother's death at all, yet she goes into depression over a *cat*? Can someone explain? She's is *the* toughest teenager I've met. She had no childhood due to her mother being on drugs, I was never home to do anything about it, so I left my seven year old little girl at home for months at a time with her crack-head mother and her crack-head friends.

I was obviously heartbroken as me and my dad were extremely close, especially this last year as he helped me get through the first year of University after I fell behind due to just being an ass.

I have a very full course this year and obviously I have missed a lot of coursework up till this point and I am very unsure if I could even remotely pull it all back before end of term exams.

So, I have been offered the option of taking the year out and picking up the exact same course exactly where I am next year. Just a soft reset if you will.

Obviously this would be a good choice to ensure that I will have no chance of failing the year as after I sort out all the lawyer stuff and finish arranging the funeral I can continue studying for effectively two years and guarantee a leg up next year. I also have quite a lot of money saved up that was to go towards having a month away at some point in my university career before I actually have to leave and start real work. So travel is also a valid option.

There are obviously a few concerns.

I live in a flat with two other people and I would have to continue paying rent, it used to be shared between my parents, (They are divorced) however with one whole half of funding being pulled out from under me I feel like I need to work to help pay for the flat, so maybe I could work for most of the year and save up some money for the years that follow?

I am also taking a very challenging course which has already tested me quite a lot in the past year and a bit, and I feel if I take a whole year out I may hit a bump in understanding and find it quite difficult to fall back into stride.

I understand this is quite an essay and I really do thank you whole heartedly if you got this far, and if you give me advice I'll be sure to thank you.

If anyone has been in a situation even remotely similar to mine I would appreciate any advice on how they handled it.

For reference I am 19, living in Scotland and studying Astrophysics.

Male friend of mine, a senior in college that we will call ""John,"" is being accused, falsely, by an ex-girlfriend of mine, who we will call ""Susan,"" of date raping her about 2 years ago. Susan is spreading the rumor across his the campus of his small college. 
The night in question, John was drinking at a party in his, and seven roommates', dorm (common room with several 2 person rooms attached) and decided to go to bed after becoming drunk so he went to his room, closed the door, and proceeded to try to fall asleep. He heard a knock at the door, answered it, and it was Susan who wanted to come in. Susan had been drinking lightly earlier in the party, but John, in usual form at this time, had probably drank at least a 1/3 of a fifth of something containing 40% ABV. Long story short, she initiates sex with him that night and thy go their merry way. (*I should also mention that this party took place about 3 months after I broke up with Susan for causing all sorts of drama, consistent immaturity, etc.*)
During the time between 2010 and now she dated one of John's close friends and constantly hung out at that dorm, and later the house John and roommates rented, attended that parties there, and hung out with John. In addition, she was bragging about having slept with John to John's friends, anyone who would listen, and even told me about it, which I did not mind because our relationship had never been very serious and was brief.
For some unknown reason, in the past 4 to 6 months, Susan has decided to start telling people that during the night in question, John date raped her. However, Susan is only telling underclassmen, the ex boyfriend of the girl John has recently started seeing, and people who were not a part of their mutual, close group of friends during the past two years. She knows that that group of friends would never believe her. John tried to confront her about the rumor, but Susan would not talk and told him, ""Don't contact me again.""
This is a SERIOUS accusation, a felony, and both John and I are baffled as to why Susan would start this. Nothing has happened between them. They just sort of became distant after Susan broke up with John's close friend (the guy after me).
What should John do? He can't go to the police because an investigation would be launched and he would get screwed, even though he would be found innocent, because America loves to play judge and jury regardless of what the court of law decides. He can't file a civil suit for slander, even though this meets the requirement for slander as set in our state of residence, because an investigation would be opened.

For some background, I'm 21 years old and in college. In the beginning of the year, my dad, a fairly successful Wall Street banker, quit his job. Now, I had never been all that close to him or anything, but I thought I had started to actually build some relationship with him the past year. We've always had a fairly awkward relationship since he treated me like shit while I was growing up (extremely high, unrealistic expectations etc.). But, within the past year I really started to feel like he was repairing our relationship. His quitting Wall Street also gained some of my respect because I thought ""wow, he really is standing up against the bad guys on Wall Street."" I even wrote in his birthday card I was proud of him and I support his choices.

Fast forward a few months. I come home and something happens, and he shows his old ways to me (berating me and such). This immediately loses all respect I had started to have for him. The awkwardness continues again.

Fast forward to around two weeks ago. We (family and I) go out to this resort. I didn't bring my laptop and I wanted to see how some people were doing in the Olympics so I borrowed my dad's laptop. I accidentally clicked on the upper tab where his e-mail was bookmarked, and boom. His inbox is filled with emails from dating websites. I think, surely it's spam, but no. I continue to look through his email (because at this point, there was no turning back) and I find A LOT of stuff. Eventually, I had figured out he has contacted prostitutes, seen some other random people from these dating websites, and he is even having an affair with one of his business partners.

I know maybe it's not exactly my place to judge/butt into my parents marriage, but I'm extremely bothered by this. He's very clearly spending money on these women, and his business partner seems extremely shady. My dad is doing a lot of independent projects right now and for some reason, she happens to be a part of every single one of them. This worries me because there seems to be a lot of money involved. My mom has casually mentioned this woman before, but she thinks the woman/partner is just a random sales person he has had minimal contact with. So, the extent of his business activity with this woman is another thing he's lying to her about, which makes me question why that is. I think he's hiding his heavy involvement (romantic and business) with this woman from my mom because my mom wouldn't approve of the woman's business practices.

Anyway, I don't really know what to think. I've imagined scenarios like my dad running off with this business partner, leaving my mom and I with no money. I'm actually not so worried about myself because I'm in college and I can try to get a job, but my mom is a housewife, and therefore has no income. I'd like to protect her, but I don't really know what to do. What do you think, Reddit?

I'm 14. About to move from 8th to 9th grade(Highschool).

I've been homeschooled my entire life since pre-school. My mom decided to do it because the drive time from home to the school just didn't appeal to her, and I was terrible about getting up early and would always get there 10-15 minutes late.

Recently I told her I wanted to stop homeschooling, and she was fine with it. The reason I want to stop is that she isn't the best teacher, our ways of going about learning clash, and I want to have some friends for the first time in way too long. I'm a *bit* shy and awkward, but I enjoy having a social life.

Now I have 2 options: 

1. Public highschool.
2. A private Christian school.

I think either of these is going to be a bit of a shock to the system, going to a regular school for the first time in my life.

Some more about me: I'm a (somewhat) recent Atheist. Nobody knows. I don't think the Christian school would be entirely bad, as you do get a bit of a better education(is that true about private schools?) and I already have to fake the whole Christian thing in the first place so pretending to pray every now and then shouldn't be that bad.

What I would like to know is which school you think would be the best option. The biggest pro of a public school to me is that there are more options for people to get to know(say hi to one, they hate you, try again with the other 10,000). That's also the biggest con of a private school to me. Everybody knows everybody. It would be difficult to fit in.(Am I wrong about this?)

My parents have been divorced for around four years. My sister and I have been in the primary custody of my mom the whole time, mainly because she lives five minutes from the high school we now attend and my dad lives 35 minutes from it.

Problem is, the longer time goes on, the worse things are getting in my house. My mom gets drunk several nights a week, but denies any drinking problems (despite losing a boyfriend of hers who we all cared about from a handful of extreme drunken incidents, which I won't explain but will say involved security and huge public embarrassment). We find empty hard liquor bottles in the recycling and know she hides alcohol in her room.

Her and my sister are also starting to get into more and more verbally aggressive arguments. My mom's personality is an ugly mix of self-righteous religion and ignorant profanity/hatred. These fights are often based on my mom's newest boyfriend, because she behaves like a 12-year-old in his presence and makes us leave the house when he comes over, often overnight (making it very obvious what's going on, despite adamant denial). Any other time it's either an overreaction to a small eyeroll, etc. from my sister (who's 16 for chrissake, and what 16-year-old girl doesn't act like that once in a while? She's a great kid overall), or my mom's 24/7 aggressive, repetitive command-giving. We literally never just talk, all that's ever said is her commanding us to do things, or telling us where she's going for the night (often bars or casinos, not getting in until 2 a.m.)

I really think it'd be best for my sister and I to live at my dad's for a while, just to let things cool off. We'd still visit her a day or two a week (like we do at my dad's currently). I wouldn't be too worried except that she's said, verbatim, ""If you move in with your father, don't come back. Take all your shit with you."", etc.

I'm worried that this will destroy what's left of our relationship with our mom. I love her and all, but she's just not good to be around. Any encouragement/tips on this?

But it's gotten to the point where I can not stand to go to school any more, and I can't force myself to deal with it.

I'm currently working for a electronics company that is making a new hardware device for enthusiasts that like to modify their gaming consoles.

The job I am currently working is a lot higher class than all the other jobs I previously had. They pay nice and treat their workers highly. I will be receiving royalties for every product sold. The product has 2 weeks left in manufacturing before it's ready. I have a bit more work to do but I could have it done by the end of the next 2 weeks, which would allow me to get a ""bonus"" payment before release.

If its any consolation, I was awarded 40/50 points for them, and I passed the final with a 95% overall.

I was informed today that the schools mental health director scheduled a meeting with my parents tomorrow in regards to the drawing. I'm not sure what to expect. I'm a straight-A student with ADHD, and I've already been accepted to college. Should I be concerned that it's the Mental Health Director and not my Dean that wants to talk to me? Could I face disciplinary action for something like this? Why now, considering the semester ended a month ago?

**TLDR:** Drew an exceptional pair of boobs on my English Final, might be in trouble for it now

**Update:** So apparently the English final was a big district-wide standardized test that made its way up to some anonymous grader, who saw the tits and was offended. The Mental Health head was just there because he was contacted about the drawing, and he just gave a mandatory *""This could be construed as sexual harassment""* talk.

I'm at a point where I honestly feel I could be fired at any point (pretty sure my blood pressure is rising too lol). I can't understand or even remember my bosses tech briefs and I feel like I am just not in the right place.

Its not like I never saw this coming either--In the back of my head, I always knew something like this would happen. Through my years of laziness and isolation, I have developed none of the skills necessary to succeed. Sure, I've dealt with depression and drug use, but I don't think those are the sole factors in my aimless disposition. I've always expected to eventually become successful and happy, but I never really lived life. . .

Right now, I'd rather just drop out of everything and get some mindless job that requires no effort then continue to punch myself every day. Why bust my ass working all day on something I hate and is causing me to feel so feel stupid. It isn't that I don't want to be good at whatever I do.

When I noticed, I hurried up and transferred the funds from Rent Account into General Account, so I wouldn't get overdrawn.

The train can't be moving so you can climb on it and stuff but as soon as it starts to move you can either jump off and run for your life or you can stay on and ambush the person that's trying to look for you. You also need weapons. Anything you can find like sticks, rocks, whatever. But if you have no ammo or weapons than you can challenge to fight the ambusher fist to fist. This game is quite dangerous but if you have balls than you won't mind playing.

The thing is... I cant live on what I make.  In fact I'm so far from living on what I make it has depressed me to the point of just giving up on everything.  I work security, I make minimum wage, I can't afford to live on my own, buy food, or do any of the other normal things an adult should be doing because of the massive amount of student loan debt I have.

1375936848.0,5,self.Advice,1jxpwd,Advice on shady / racist neighbors,5,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jxpwd/advice_on_shady_racist_neighbors/,"First, my family is Korean and our neighbors are white (important later, I guess). Our house is located off a street, not in a neighborhood, so we're a bit separated from other houses. We only have our two neighbors (one to each side) - one of them is an elderly couple and we get along with them great. Lately though, we've have been having a lot of problems with our other neighbors. Just to recap a few of the happenings.

* About 6 months ago, our nice neighbors got robbed. The grandpa likes to restore old cars in his garage. He told me that he left his garage door open by mistake while he took a bath and when he came back, a bunch of his tools and some of his wife's jewelery were missing. I was home at the time and I didn't hear any car pull up in his driveway, and the fact that he was gone for a half hour bath makes it seem like the thief lives nearby. About a month later, somebody *really* shook at our back door around midnight. My brother and I woke up - he grabbed a baseball bat and I grabbed a flashlight. We both tried to catch whoever / whatever it was, but it was too dark to see anything. We opened the door and *thought* we heard rustling grass and the opening of a fence. I mention this because there's a metal fence (with a gate) separating our home with our bad neighbors. I had a chat with the grandpa and we both wanted to call the police, but without any proof, decided we couldn't do anything.

* My parents own a fairly large grocery store ~ about the size of a Walgreens. As a result, we carry a lot of stock and merchandise in our garage. Two months ago, my brother left to pick my sister up from school but he forgot to close the garage door. When he came back, a lot of the merchandise in our garage was gone (about half) BUT there were about 3 boxes of product placed on the right side of our garage - our bad neighbors are to the right. Also interesting, when he came home, the mother looked at him and went inside. This is strange because I'm almost certain the mother is unemployed and she honestly sits on her porch all day. So for her to go inside right when my brother came back, after they looked at him as if he was the reason, was a big red flag. We called the police and went and confronted them, asking if they knew anything about where our products went, especially since she sits on her porch all day. She got a little red-faced and told us to wait while she went inside. She brings out her daughter and says it was her. In her words, ""I KNEW something was wrong when she kept bringing all that stuff. I kept wondering where she was getting it from"" About ~$300 worth of stuff was taken including things like snacks, but also things like duct tape, mouthwash, cigarettes, 5 hour energies - what kind of 8 year old girl would steal duct tape? The officer got really sympathetic when the mom said it was her and said he wasn't going to file a report, but he did order her to return everything. The thing is, it took her about *20 trips* back and forth. How can a little girl carry all that stuff into her own home by herself without her parents noticing (especially since she has to store it somewhere in their small 1-story ranch home. Plus, the mom is *always* sitting on her porch).

* Today, my parents got harassed by their son who looks like he's in his mid-twenties. My parents were coming home from work and while they were getting inside, the son says to my parents ""Wi Tu Lo, Sum Ting Wong, Ho Li Fuk, Bang Ding Ow"" - from that San Francisco news report. My Dad got upset and asked him what his problem was, but the son just laughed and said, ""Fuck you, go back to your country"" and went inside. My mom's dad just recently passed away and she's been really down lately, and this was enough to push her to tears.

My neighbors just seem really shady and today they verbally harassed my parents. It just seems like it's getting worse everyday and and I'm also worried because my parents are getting older now. Is there anything we can do in this situation?

**TL;DR** 

* We think that our neighbors tried to break in 5 months ago. 

* ~$300 worth of stuff stolen from our garage. Called police, they blame it on their daughter, nothing happens.

* Parents racially harassed by their son.",,False,,t5_2qjdm,1375991136.0,,,True,t3_1jxpwd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jxpwd/advice_on_shady_racist_neighbors/,

""I just like the company"" she says or ""its no big deal to just send a message"". 

She will sacrifice her own needs to help me even when I don't need or want help. Example,  growing up she often drove me places even after I insisted I could walk. 
When she does need somthing there usually is no choice. She is afraid of travelling alone so she asks me to go with her (when I was living with her) if I refuse because of another appointment she will sigh to herself and say ""I can't depend on anybody"" or make some other remark that indirectly makes me feel guilty.

I often wished she  had friends of her own and a life of her own. Instead I AM her life. It feels like I've got a chain around my neck and its tied to her. I haven't been able to fully live because of this.

I was pretty happy as a kid looking back but when I became a teenager and started needing more Independence she would not or could not give it to me. I feel dead. It's utterly killed my spontaniety. 
I also believe it's behind the anxiety I suffer from. I've unable to deal with a crisis or decision making at work. 

I feel I could if I felt more ""free"". If It was ok for me to be responsible for my own life and make my own decisions. It doesn't feel like my life at all. It feels like hers

I should mention that this is all made harder because she suffers from severe anxiety, tinnitus and recently some kind of throat condition and easily becomes overwhelmed and emotional so I can't confront her either not that it would probably do much good.

I live in a house that shares a wall with the neighbor's house. He's a senior, had two heart attacks already and lives alone with his dog. I've never seen anybody visit him. He works at a nearby Dollar Tree.

Awhile ago, an awful smell (almost like a dead animal) began coming up from downstairs. Long story short, it wasn't a dead mouse in the walls like we initially thought, but a squirrel or something had chewed a hole in the insulation down there and the awful smell was actually coming through from his apartment.

I went over there. It's not worthy of Hoarders, but his carpets are completely stained. The walls are dirty too. He never cleans his apartment. He lets the dog defecate and urinate in the apartment, probably because he can't walk him often enough. He doesn't bathe the dog either.

I can't tell if the dog or just the disgusting state of his home in general is causing the smell, but it's slowly ruining the lives of my fiancee and myself. We've tried sealing where our houses adjoin to make it airtight. No luck. We've tried complaining to the rental company (he rents from them as well), but all they've done is tell him to get his carpet cleaned.

The smell is bad enough that we can't sleep downstairs in our own bedroom 50% of the time.

So what do I do now? It's not feasible for us to move right now and before the smell started, we'd never been happier with a place we've lived in. We don't have a problem with the neighbor either besides this. We just want to be able to relax when we come home from a long day of work, you know?

So, for what now seems like some stupid reason, we decided to book a holiday.  My dad agreed to pay until we got paid in a couple of days time.  He seemed so pleased with this and was constantly talking about our future and telling me how happy he was.

This was until last Wednesday.  I missed a call from him, so I called him back and there was no answer so I sent a text saying I was taking the dog out and would try again soon.  No answer again when I got back. I later got a very unhappy text from him because he'd tried to call whilst I was out with the dog and didn't answer.  He also said he'd just spoken to someone we both know and thought my opinions on him were unfair.  Said someone then deleted me on facebook.

We had plans for Thursday, unusually I hadn't heard from him since the previous nights text, but decided to go on with what we had planned to do anyway.  So I headed into town and there he was, right infront of me, with another woman.  I have no idea who the woman was, could be a relative for all I know, but either way he didn't acknowledge me, so I just went on my way.

And that's it.  Haven't heard from him since.  My dad now has a great big dent in his wallet as said ex never paid up, and the holiday company have advised us that the booking was non refundable.  I've tried to call and text but he is totally ignoring me.

So basically I'm looking for your opinions on 2 things, 
1. wtf has happened?  One minute, totally obsessed, next it's like I never existed.
2. Should I keep nipping at him for the cash for the holiday?

Basically I know the answer is probably, no I won't get my money, and no I'll never know what happened.  Tbh it's not really about the money, I just want to know why.  I'm guessing said mutual friend must have said something.  But how can I make him talk to me?  I feel like I'll never rest until I know why, but I think I might just have to forget about it.  Sorry this was way longer than expected!!  Any thoughts greatly appreciated.

TL;DR - Met this guy who seemed to be really into me, was going really well, is now totally ignoring me.  We booked a non-refundable holiday, and he won't cough up his share of the cash.",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_1jbhlj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jbhlj/a_little_help_please/,

I'm not sure what I did, maybe our differences are just taking there toll, like how I'm black and there all white or how they're all middle-high income families  and I'm rather low. I'm not sure what to do, do I tell them how I feel? do I just let go? IDK I guess the worst part is I'll probably be going into my senior year with none of the friends I've had before.

We are both single and about the same age (mid twenties). Needless to say, I'd love to date her if it were something that might actually happen. 

My previous relationships weren't really founded on my manning up and directly asking someone out, they just sort of happened organically through familiarity. Calling someone and literally asking 'you wanna go out sometime?"" seems really awkward to me and as a result I really dislike doing it. I have done it before and I felt SO uncomfortable doing so. 

I have no real idea how she feels about me beyond 'oh, he's a dude I work with' or 'he's made me laugh a few times' but maybe i'm just horribly inattentive to other giveaways when it comes to that. Not that i'm expecting her to say no persay...it's just a fear. I just feel like we have gotten to know each other enough that I'd really like to hang out with her and see if there is anything real there. Unlike previous girlfriends this is a relationship that began at work and that's very different than any of my other experiences. 

The short of it is this: Should I ask her out on a proper date or do you think that would REALLY mess with the professional relationship if she were to say no? I mean, I can certainly see how things would be maximum awkward if she really disliked me and said no. I have no idea how to approach this situation.

If I leave him alone in a normal smelling room and come back an hour or so later and see this kid under a sheet, or awkwardly straddling a couch cushion, and the whole room will have the death scent to it.

This smell was never in the house until he hit puberty. If he wears dirty shorts, I can smell this on him from about 10 feet away. Jizz or not, it's a really strong and nasty smell.

I want friends and family over, but it stinks in here so bad that I'm embarrassed. Not just for myself, but everyone in the house. I'm also afraid to use most of the furniture or lend him my magazines, games or books.

I've caught him whacking it while I and my mother were in the same room with him. He even goes at it in the room with our grandparents' and father's ashes. The downstairs couch is basically ruined. He doesn't seem to have any respect for anyone or anything in the house.

I've tried ""dropping hints"" and letting him know that I *notice* without letting him know that I *know* anything. Like, ""Oh, the den smells weirdly funky today. Do you know what it is?""

She didn't listen. She started taking her clothes, books, art supplies, shoes, etc. and hiding them in her room. My girlfriend would ask for them back, and C would deny having any of those things. She got a locking doorknob for her bedroom door to keep us from going in and reclaiming my girlfriend's things. She told Sister A that we were stealing her stuff, and of course A believed her and helped her buy and install the lock. My girlfriend bought a padlocked box to put her clothing in, but my clothing(including bras and underwear-wtf) still show up missing and I find them in her laundry. When confronted about the locking doorknob, C replied with 'That was to keep my sisters out,' even though both her sisters have a key.

We finally broke down and bought a locking doorknob of our own. Within the first day of using it, our room was broken into 3 times, and when we returned home at the end of the day all of our books were thrown about the room. I have resorted to keeping all of my clothing in my car, along with some of my girlfriend's.

Sister B is very laid-back, she doesn't interfere with people's problems, she mostly just plays Black Ops and Minecraft. However, her Pomeranian is not even slightly house-trained, and she is very lazy. I have to wear shoes to walk across the kitchen floor because she refuses to mop up her dog's pee or pick up its poop. She makes bowls of ramen, eats half, and leaves the bowls sitting out to attract bugs. She borrows our books and leaves them sitting where her dog can chew them, or on the sink where water can damage them.

Sister A collects money from everyone for rent and utilities. She is very specific about who pays how much, etc. However, this month our electric bill came to over $400 because of all the late fees. She is a manager at a fast-food place, yet she never has any money. Yet somehow she managed to afford a purebred Husky puppy and a donkey. She also never listens when my girlfriend or I have something to say. She always believes her sisters and has no respect for us. She buys groceries and gets mad when we try to eat any of it. She cooks and doesn't let us have any.

Also, someone left a huge plate of rice on the kitchen counter, despite my constant pleas for everyone to clean up their plates, and my cat got into it while I was at work and is now sick.

My mother is letting my girlfriend and I move in with her, but that won't be for a few more weeks. Help until then? I apologize for the wall of text.",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,,True,t3_1itmxg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1itmxg/roommates_from_hell/,
1374459708.0,5,self.Advice,1isbk9,Advice for a guy: parties and making moves on girls,5,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1isbk9/advice_for_a_guy_parties_and_making_moves_on_girls/,"Hello ladies and gentlemen,

Disclaimer: I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question, but I thought it seemed pretty good to ask here (I am relatively new here)

I have some questions that I would appreciate some insight on. I went to a party last night and played beer pong with a couple of cool girls. As the night went on, I wanted to progress and what not so I started talking to them. They were friendly so we talked about college, sports, music, etc...My female friend who brought me to the party told me to make a move sometime in the middle of the night so I put my arm around one of the girls. She was fine with it but I did not know how to progress from there. The party kind of fizzled out after that but I left feeling like I had wasted an opportunity. 

In order to make this post more complete I probably should give y'all some more information (no bragging intended). In terms of me, I am a guy, 6'4"", athletic/built, friendly and courteous. When I get drunk I get a little cocky but it is more playful than harmful. My friends who are girls describe me as ""sexy, handsome, cute, serious"". They do not think I am gay. Although the one I get the most is cute, which I believe is due to my shyness. Most girls (who I am not friends with) say it ""he is cute"" right after I meet them, to the girls I am friends with. My friends usually tell me after the party is over. :/

So given that background, I would like a female perspective on what you consider a reasonable way for a guy to flirt with you, at a party. My friends frequently describe me as nice but I am more shy than nice. I am learning, however, that being kind of cocky and teasing attracts girls (at least in the vapid sense) more than being nice and friendly. Also, when I drink, pretty much all of my social inhibitions vanish and I can talk freely/confidently with anyone. 

So the bottom line is that I have a chance to have a good night but I do not know when to make the right moves, I wait too long to make them or I am unsure if what I am doing is acceptable. I have integrity so I am not just going to start groping a lady right when I meet her, but that integrity makes it hard for me to judge things sometimes. 

I have the confidence to approach a girl and chat with her, I do not however, know when you ladies would consider it appropriate for me to ""make a move"". Telling me about body language that women do (preening,etc...) and what not would be cool as well. Thank you for any insight.

I need help because my mom's boyfriend(let's call him Richard, shall we?) keeps bothering me and using my mother to get me and my brother in shit because he hates the both of us, will explain and tell more stories if asked.
 
Well, earlier today, I was on my computer, just playing LoL, and people who play it should know that you can get in serious shit and week bans for leaving ranked games. I put a frying pan from dinner in the dishwasher earlier, and he comes and starts shaking my chair and asking me or my brother who put it in there, because apparently it's allowed in there when hes not home but isn't when he is. So Dick is shaking my chair and I resist the shaking of it and negate it a little bit, and say ""Could you please stop doing that. I did it. I'm sorry, I can't  get off my computer now, i'll do it after this."" so Dick goes into his and my mom's room and complains to her, comes back and tells me ""If you don't do it RIGHT NOW, I'll unplug your computer and ground you."" o I type brb in-game and say ""Alright, i'll go do it. So I scrub and scrub it, and he also pulls out the rice cooker pot (which I have seen both my mother and him put in there) and tells me to clean that. So I do that, and he keeps making rude statements to me, I can't recall any right now, sorry. I tell him ""Could you please stop saying those things, they're disrespectful. so he points at the rice cooker and says ""THAT'S 
disrespectful!"" and repeats both actions towards the pan also. so I finis cleaning them, and go back to my game. Dick obviously checks the pot and pan, and, sure enough, I missed a spot on the pan (the rice cooker was perfect) because I was hurrying to get back to my game. I was holding it by the handle while cleaning it, and it has a lip on it http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v0/214508433/Colorful_non_stick_aluminum_frying_pan.jpg kind of like that, except 90 degrees upward instead of 45 and couldn't see the stains on the back lip. I cleaned literally EVERYWHERE else and scrubbed it down to the last bit and he complains to my mom and she comes out and yells at me to turn off my computer. I go to finally clean it one last time, and he, yet again, bitches at me and it pisses me off because he's winning his dumb bullshit over a dirty pan. I say ""leave me alone! Please leave me alone!"" and my mom hears and comes out, grabs a cooking utensil and hits me on the bottom 4 times. She tells me to go to my room and I'm and now i'm here. I hear him saying "" Oh, I can clean it, it's fine."" as my mother is doing the last bits of my missed handiwork, which really pissed me off. I tried talking to her before about it, but she gets angry and I don't want to stray into that territory and get in shit again. I don't know what do and I feel powerless and want to get a knife and threaten him not to come near me and bother me, or else I will do something about it. I ant really do anything, and I want to phone my real dad and ask him about it. That's the only thing I can think of that might help.

- College drop-out
- Alcohol and substance abuse problems
- Pending DUI 
- Living with parents
- Recently fired
- No car
- No drivers license for 3 months
- Around $25,000 in credit card and student loan debt

This is how I've ordered it so far:

1. Stop drinking
2. Find a job
3. Pay lawyer
4. Move
5. File bankruptcy
6. Go back to school 

My current plan: 


- I left out the car and driver's license part because my license will be reinstated in 3 months. I don't want to buy a car because I'm going to attempt to move to Chicago in the first week of August, and they have great public transportation. I have a sister who lives there, and my mom is making me go with her to stay for 2 months and look for employment in that time. I have bar/restaurant experience where I live now (not a server or bartender unfortunately, just as a hostess and club admissions) so I will attempt to first look there, although I don't know if I could be in that environment if I'm trying to completely abstain from alcohol for at least a few months. 


- If I do get a job, I would have to find a roommate and then move out there completely. I still owe my DUI lawyer about $1,200 dollars, which needs to be paid in full by September. I don't know if I'll be able to get that by then and will probably have to borrow from family until I start making some money again. I already owe my mother $1800 dollars (the deposit for the lawyer). I have never lived on my own before either and I'm terrified, especially in a new city, but I must, must, must leave where I am at right now. 


- I want to file for bankruptcy because I don't think it would be possible for me to make payments on my lines of credit and everything while doing all of that. My payments all together for my cards are ~$900 dollars a month and I've long stopped paying them. I'm also fairly young and won't need to buy a house or anything using credit in the next 7-10 years. If I want a car, I can save up and pay cash. 

- I'm so close to losing it, and I'm so depressed. This all happened so fast and I need to make a change. This is the first time in my life that I've even made a list like this or done anything like this, and this is the first time that I finally will admit that booze is the source of most of my problems. (Dropped out of school because I was partying too much, getting fired for coming in drunk, DUI, partying after a bad break-up and running up my credit cards like a maniac on alcohol and clothes, etc.) That's why it's first on my list. I desperately need help and I have no idea who to ask. Should I seek a therapist? Is there somewhere where I can find a life mentor that I can continually meet with or ask questions to?

What if you don't want to?",7,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iea49/is_this_what_it_means_to_be_outgrowing_your/,"I have a small group of friends. I've known them since I was 4. They have all sort of been the type of kids who are attracted to drama and gossip (which I will admit, I was just as guilty growing up, as that's a very high school thing to do) But now, in our early 20s, they are still, what people may describe as ""negative nancies."" They seem to always have some sort of negative opinion on everything everyone does. The biggest issue I am having with them currently, is that they have recently been ragging on me for leaving a full-time job at a fast food place, for a part-time job in the field I have studied in.

Out of my group of friends, I'm the only one who has graduated college. I don't talk to them about it, and I don't ever try to get them to go back to school themselves (as I know from being a college kid, that sometimes college isn't for everyone). As much as they always rant about how much they hate their current jobs in retail, I understand that they have been working these jobs long enough that they get paid more than enough to justify just ""sucking it up.""

I don't have that luxury. College was a very difficult time for me and my family, both financially and emotionally. And after I graduated, I promised myself to make it all worth it. Unfortunately, the job market is how it is, and I spent the first few years after school taking any job I could get, from selling lottery tickets, to serving coffee; basically anything that paid the bills until I got what I went to school for.

This year, I finally landed a job that I enjoy and one that is sort of in my field of study. It's not my dream job by any means, but it's definitely something that makes me feel like I'm headed in the right direction and my efforts go towards helping build a better society. Landing this job sparked a new found motivation in me, and inspired me to further believe in my goals. So I began doing more and more things to help me eventually land my dream job (internships/volunteering etc.) As much as I would love to be excited about these things, I feel as though I cannot share any sort of this happiness with my best friends. Whenever I even so much as mention something work-related, they almost always say things like, ""I still don't understand why you took that job."" ""You don't even work full-time, it is really worth leaving [old place of employment]?""

I love them dearly. Through the years we've grown up together, we have had countless amazing times together, and in those moments I swear I would never trade them for the world. But, lately, I've been feeling like I am at a crossroads with them. I feel like I have worked my ass off for years, and I finally feel like my goals are within reach... but then I hear them say the things they say to me, and I just crumble all over again. I've read a lot of people say in order to be successful you need to leave the people who try to bring you down... but what do you do when you actually look at these people as family more than just your friends.

So, my boyfriend Steve and I started dating a year ago through the internet, when he was in Florida. He moved down to Colorado Springs and lived there for a time with some friends, and now he's in Pueblo where I live. We live together with another couple, Brandon, Steve's high school friend, and Mary, my friend for a couple of years. We hooked them up and they've been dating for a couple months. We share a two bedroom apartment. Mary and I are not on the lease, but the rent is split between Brandon and Steve and each couple buys their own groceries, splitting cabinet and refrigerator space.

Living with them is very tough. Brandon has anger issues, and is very destructive with the house. He's punched several holes in his bedroom walls, broke the toilet tank lid, ripped one of the sliding closet doors out of its track after he got frustrated with it and today he kicked down the front door after it was jammed, splintering the doorframe and causing management to become very angry with us. In general he goes into fits and yells and throws things often.

Brandon and Mary fight a bunch, as well. Normally, I wouldnt care and that would be their business, but their fighting and any yelling/throwing of stuff triggers my panic attacks. Before I moved in I hadnt had them for 2-3 years. 

I am so happy living with my boyfriend, we genuinely enjoy eachothers company and being able to live together after we had to spend so long apart. We co-habitate spectacularly together. My parents live in town, but I really dont want to move back and leave my boyfriend to deal with these two on his own. It takes about a thousand or so to break our lease, and currently they're on a one year lease. They have about 9 months left.

The best thing for me, given my panic and anxiety, is probably that I move back in with my parents or at least spend more time there. But before I do that, do you guys have any advice for me?

I called cops once because the male roommate came home drunk while I was at work hit his girlfriend and threatened mine he was arrested and released but me and my girl did not allow him in house. 3 weeks later he was allowed back in under condition that he is basically the house bitch ( basically do all the basic cleaning dishes vacuum carpets and sweep and clean bathroom once a week) I already take care of most stuff in house like lawn dog pen and still clean. ( which isn't a problem I don't want to be lazy) and basically now he will wipe down kitchen counter and put dishes in washer and be under assumption he cleaned whole kitchen and that's all he should do. Cops were called again recently because female Roomate slammed a door in my girl's face and threatened her. Sry went on a rant there. Now I know the male has an active warrant for child support and I know the girl has one for traffic. I want to get them out of the house but doubt they will leave willingly.

It definetly wasn't an easy choice for me and I still feel bad doing it, but it was the only thing I could do.

First and foremost, I'm still in highschool, i feel like this is a pretty big detail. This girls name was Brianna, and I had met her at a party the summer before my freshmen year. She was absolutly gorgeous and we really hit it off by playing catch with my best friend and her friend. (I know, I was a lady slayer back then) I was a little apprehensive about texting her, even though she was really adamant about wanting my number and wanting to text me. I had a girlfriend at the time and I was scared to death that she was going to come between us. Well, at some point my friend talked me into texting her and it was one of the best decisions I've made. We really hit it off. We had such great chemistry and she was just amazing. She quickly became one of my favorite people and I'd go as far to say at some point she was my best friend. (even though I never saw her in person after that day.) 
The whole summer I texted her just about every day and I couldn't wait to do so. I would make up the dumbest excuses for texting her and I didn't care and it didnt seem to bother her either. Well, school started up that fall and our texts became fewer and further between. We were both just so busy with everything, me starting a new school, and her dealing with her own problems it was just to much. Well that was untill about December, when me and my girlfriend of the time broke up. That absolutly devastated me, and I really felt alone at that point. It took a real bit on my self confidence too. Well that night I decided to text Bri and tell her about what happend. She was really caring toward me and made sure I was okay. (It was my first break up and I was a wreak.) after that night our texts started to pick up and they were becoming more and more flirty as time went on. And I was by no means complaining, in fact I was loving it. Well, that was untill I met another girl, her name was taylor. Taylor, would go on to become the girl to give me the longest relationship of my life, and also be the love of my life for about a year. Unfortunately, she was also the reason that I had to stop talking to Bri (ill go more into that later) 
Myself and Taylor had quite the problems relationship, which I didn't like. But it still never made me stop loving her. And when you had a relationship the way ours was, you had alot of pent up feelings, and when you have all of thoose pent up feelings you need someone to vent them to, and that person just so happend to be bri. She always listened to whatever I was bitching to her about, and I always returned the favor to her. It was a nice trade off and we were eachothers support systems. That brought us so close together, so by about the mid point of the year we were right back to texting just about every day about everything. 
Now, when your that close to another girl, andyou have a girlfriend that just loves trouble, something is bound to happen. It just so happend to be that me and her broke up over this. Now, I know any normal human being would recognize that she was bad for me and that I probably shouldn't have even wanted her back, but I did. For sme reason I didn't realize what I could've had with Bri, and all I could see was this my ex and how much I wanted her. Well, it just so happend that one of the stipulations for me getting back with Taylor was me stopping talking with Bri. And me with my clouded judgement accepted and went happily on with Taylor. 
After about a month into the summer of my soft more year, I realized that I missed Bri alot, and I figured that I could just text her a few times and Taylor wou,d never have to know. Well as it turns out, she had the hugest crush in me all along. She admitted that she was absolutly in love with me and she wanted t be with me so badly. And this absolutly killed me because I was still in love with Taylor, but I still wanted to be friends with Bri. That didnt go to well, and Bri told me that I was an asshole and how bad I was, and that hurt coming from someone I had grown so close to over the past months. So, I accepted this and moved on that I probably would never get to talk t her again. 
Well, now we came to about January of last year. ( my soft more year) and I texted her and apologized telling her that I was really sorry for the way things had to end between us, and how I felt s horrible abut everything. She accepted my appology, and told me that she knew she kind of over reacted herself, but the only problem was that it wasent the same as it was before. It just felt different talking to her. Tat only lasted for about a day or two, and we both kind of just stopped talking mutually.
Well, now were here at the summer going into my junior year, and now that me and Taylor are broken up again I'm really starting to think about Bri again, mainly about how much I want things to go bad t the way they were with her. I don't even want a relationship with Bri at this point, I just want to be an,e to talk to her and vent the was we did before. I've been through alot lately me I'm really wishing that I had her to get me through it. 

If you have any insit, or advice about this whole situation it would be great. Your thoughts, what I should do, anything is welcome.

Here's some back story.  He's 23 years old and never gotten a high school diploma.  When he was younger (around 18), he got into some trouble with the courts.  No felonies or anything like that, he just missed a court date over some minor charge and it started to snow ball into a whole situation where he has around $1500 in fines he has to pay, ($500 by the end of august or he goes to jail.)  My dad and I live in Hawaii, he had to leave and move back to Illinois because he couldn't stay here with us (strict Home owners assoc.)  Final bit of back story, the kid is a super lightweight and if the kid has 3 beers he turns into a nightmare.  He isn't violent but I guess it like amplifies his depression or whatever and he calls up at 3a.m. central time and threatens suicide.   We really think that he might actually try it soon and we're very worried.  Living 4000+ miles away we can't convince him that he needs help, he refuses to listen.  Our mother lives near by and she's afraid for her life of him because he's knocked her around a few times before.  

I understand that a person needs to want to be helped in order to get help.  We've used our connections back home to get him set up with great jobs, places to live etc. but he keeps burning down bridges.  Every time I get a call from my brother it literally could be the last time I hear from him, we dread getting the inevitable phone call that he was found dead.

The kid needs some mental counseling, but we can't force him to do anything.  What can we do/say to convince him that he needs to seek some help?  The first step is to get him some help with alcohol I'm sure.  He doesn't drink often or to excess.  It just reacts with his midset in such a way that he loses control. 

I don't know what we can do.  I love my brother, and I understand that he made some terrible choices when he was younger.  I need some advice on what I can do before I get that dreaded 3am phone call from the police.  If you've had similar experiences or any suggestions please help.

What can I do?,4,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hyw7u/my_sister_is_stressing_my_whole_family_out_but_no/,"Family Situation:  My parents are divorced.  I (23f) lives with my Dad and my sister(22), with my sisters two kids Girl (3) and Baby Boy (1 week) in a house we rent from my grandmother. 


My sister is addicted to pain medications and prescription drugs. She does not have a job to speak of. The father of her two kids is pretty much done with her and the children. He has no intention of paying child support, Sister is too lazy to go to legal channels to get him to and she thinks it'll make him leaver even though he's already in a relationship with some other girl. But since sister hasn't caught him, she pretends he isn't fucking around on her. 


She steals money from us (dad and I) and things like jewelry to pawn for drug money.  She steals medicine from us I had surgery a while back and had some pain meds I was taking, she took a bunch of them(I have gotten a safe for my money and remaining valuables).  She eats all our food but doesn't buy any. She tears up our kitchen and living room but wont clean.  She dumps both Girl and Baby Boy on me and goes off to score more drugs. She's on foodstamps but won't let us use them to get food/diapers for her two kids.  She uses them to go get expensive junk food, right now we have a cabinet full of cereal and snack cakes and candies that she's bought for herself. 


 If she's not sleeping, getting high, or making a mess. She's having fights with her baby daddy, usually in front of the kids or in our front yard.  She tries to use the kids against him to make him stay, but he really does not give a shit because he's a terrible person and just hangs around to fuck her.


Sister was suppose to be staying with Mom after she had Baby Boy, but she and mom hate each other so now she's shacking up in our spare bedroom contributing nothing. Sometimes I go stay with mom to get away from the drama at Dad's house, but I don't really get along with Mom either.  No one does. 


Dad is the only one that works currently (I'm in the process of finding a job). Sister will usually bother him for money, saying its for groceries, diapers, gas, whatever.  It never is. It's for drugs.  He knows it, but I think he's willing himself not to believe it because he's just so disappointed. I think he's scared too, that if he confronts her she'll take away his grandkids, and he really loves his grandkids.  I've talked to him about kicking Sister out, but he just says ""Yeah, I know it's bad."" and does nothing. 


I currently try to keep the house in order and do what I can while I'm unemployed, but its difficult having a toddler, a new born, and a drug addict living under my roof. I'm usually the one watching the kids, feeding them, cleaning them, putting them to bed, making sure they're entertained.


Our grandmother came over recently after Sister had spent the night wrecking most of the house having some sort of fit or other over her baby daddy (who is back now, also sleeping in our back room, eating our food, and wrecking the house) and said if we don't keep the house in better conditions she was going to be forced to kick us out.


Sister doesn't give a shit. Dad won't do anything. And I feel like giving up.  Its incredibly stressful and I'm just so mad and frustrated. I don't have any idea what to do.  I have no where else to go and it feels like I'm going to be stuck here raising two kids that aren't even mine while their momma gets high in the back room and everyone just over looks this shit.

I can count on one hand the number of people I keep in contact with. And yet, even these people I do not trust enough to discuss the possibility that I have recently concluded: I think I am a [covert narcissist](http://sparkster.hubpages.com/hub/The-Covert-Narcissist). The reason I don't make many friends is because I don't think I can be honestly friendly to new people. I now think a reason I can't get a girlfriend is because I shouldn't, for her sake. Apparently, I may very well be an emotional vampire. I never chose to be this. I've done a lot for my community through volunteer services, and I even buy meals for homeless people; but there's the very real chance that I only did this to self-agrandize. There's no way I can afford counseling or therapy, what else can I do? 

Tl;dr: Turns out that I was the asshole all along; how can I change this when it's a sub-councious-ish problem?

1372983658.0,5,self.Advice,1hnx5k,I was offered a new job. But...,5,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hnx5k/i_was_offered_a_new_job_but/,"So I got a great opportunity last year to run my own small kitchen in a cafe.  Which was great.  I loved what I did, learned a lot, made some great food, had a few disasters of course, but that's just how it goes sometimes.

Then I stopped getting paid pretty much altogether.  It started after a financial backer decided to pull the plug over a personal vendetta against the owner, and got worse over Christmas break.  It's a college town so things slowed down and we didn't have an established customer base of any kind really.  So we were barely staying afloat.  I was putting in 50 hours a week or more and making maybe 200 a month.  When I heard one of my cooks asked for some money and was told there was none to pay them and she broke down and cried, I took some money I had been given and split it between the two cooks I had at the time.

Since then the pay has increased a little, I get around 400 a month now, 500 if things are going well.  I mean business is certainly up and is increasing.  That much is evident by the fact it's summer now and we again have a huge dive in population but we have a ""crowd"" that we see all the time, and we get new faces too.  But I've had to give up a lot in the past few months for the sake of this place.  I mean seriously, having to pawn stuff to get medicine when I'm sick is a pretty deflating thing.

Everyone is on edge, moral is just absolutely shit among everyone.  What kills me the most is a family member (to the owner) is putting their life on hold and has invested 10K of their own money into the place.  And the owner has no idea.  

Well anyways, I had to cook for a new chef who popped up in town to open a high end place.  It's certainly stuff above what I've done before.  And the guy has one hell of a reputation, and not just locally, globally.  He liked my food, saw I had some talent and offered me a job.  But I explained to him the situation, skimping on many details obviously, and said I really wanted the job, but I had this sense of responsibility, loyalty, and many other things to the cafe.  He said he understood and respected that, and that I should take a few days to think things over and then come see him when I had made a decision.

I don't want to abandon the cafe altogether.  Especially the family member who is secretly invested in the place.  They are there every single day working their ass off and putting their life completely on hold just for that place and giving up just as much as me.  That's what hurts the most about this.  I don't want to abandon them because the stress of it all is starting to take it's toll on them too and it's really showing.  And no, there is no attraction between I and them.  They are just probably one of the most good intentioned and caring people you could ever hope to meet in life, and I don't like to see good people suffer.

The new job would be an amazing opportunity for me, low pay at first (which I expected) but more than I'm getting now.  Not only that, but I have an opportunity to learn from an unbelievably talented Chef.

I know it seems obvious what I should do.  But this whole moral conflict over the cafe is really freaking me out right now.  I've spent the last few hours trying to figure out what to do.  I'm physically ill over this.  The Chef said that my reasons for wanting to stay at the cafe were noble, but ultimately I had to do what was right for me.  It doesn't help that I'm kept out of the loop on many things and communication is just absolutely rubbish.

I've never been this afraid of making a decision in my life.

1372959995.0,4,self.Advice,1hn870,Trust problems?,4,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hn870/trust_problems/,"Hello, 

This is an extremely hard thing for me to do, but I don't have anyone else who I can really ask about this sort of stuff, sad i know :) 

Basically, me and my girl friend have been together for just over a year and a half now, we actually met online, although none of our friends know this. I am 22 and she is 21, although she is in university and I am in full time employment We hardly ever argue, we have lots of things in common, we each have our own hobbies too, and spend the majority of the time together, we each have our own day to do what we please and not spend the day together, just to give each some space. We are both madly in love with each other, and we are both soul mates for each other, and that's not just me, she says this too, perhaps more so from her on somethings. We still go on ""dates"" to the movies, and restaurants, I will still surprise her with gifts/flowers, she'll still make me a nice meal most nights, I have just paid for us both to go to Florida later this year as it has always been her dream to go to Disney, so it pretty much it seems perfect from the outside, and the majority of the time, it is perfect. 

A few days ago, she dropped it on me that she is/was planning on moving to London when she finishes uni, we both live in East Midlands (about 130 miles away from anyone not sure), to both increase her career prospects and just to see some where new. This is the first I have heard of any plans like this, but apparently she had been talking about it to her friend for a good few months, but failed to include me in the discussions/thought process. 

She says she would like to carry on being together, we would take it in turns to go and see each other at weekends (i drive), would make use of trains/coaches ect. I am OK with this as much as I can be...it would only be a year she says, so not that long in the grand scheme of things. While we don't live together yet, she is still in student housing, and I am still at home, we had originally planned, together, last year that when she had finished uni, we would start looking for a place together, I was skeptical in the past about moving in together, due to the financial side of it; due to her being in full time education, it would be hard to live off just my wage. Now, I'm not going to toot my own horn, but I make a good living for someone my age, I work for a giant American company, and have got a good foot on the career ladder. So if push came to shove, I could probably look after us both on my wage, it would just be extremely ""living on the breadline"" considering I have a car to run as well. 


Let me give you some background on me that is probably crucial to the whole story. I have not had much luck with relationships in the past.

My first; was like many social awkward people, an Facebook friend request and it went from there. She lived in Cornwall (bottom of the England for anyone outside UK), so it was a massive distance apart, took almost 6 hours on the train. I only visited her three times for the 6 months we were together. Now things didn't exactly get off to a great start with this relationship, a few weeks into it, she told me that she ""can't do it anymore"" for no real reason and didn't want to be in a relationship, I stupidly pursued her to stay with me. I would book a hotel and travel to see her every 2 months or so, train tickets/hotels were fairly expensive for what they were...and for some reason, she never told her parents about me (we were both 19/20 and she still lived at home too), but to cut this story short, a few days before it was time for me to go and see her again, she sent me a text again, saying that she didnt see me as a boyfriend any more...just as a friend, and that she couldnt stand the thought of us having sex when she didn't feel the same. Then I found out that all of her friends were prompting her to cheat on me with this guy, although she claims she never did. I will never find out, and don't really want to. 

Second relationship was an absolute train wreck, again, we met online (god im such a nerd!!) She cheated on me, alot. I was stupidly enough to not see it at first. I spent far too much money on her at christmas time (new blackberry and 3ds), she got me nothing, YAY. Basically towards the end of the relationship, I had just grown fed up of her walking all over me and treating me like shit, so I ended it. Then she admitted, along with her friend, that she had slept with well over 10 guys in the three months we were together. 

Then a few months after her, I met my current girlfriend, the love of my life. 

Here's where the problems come in here though, I think due to my past relationships either ending in the fact that they were cheating on me, or for the distance factor, the whole situation with her moving to London is scaring the living shit out of me. 

When I think about it, I know she would never cheat on me; but she does seem very secretive about somethings, like if I reached to move her phone, she would dive half way across the room, she claims its because she thinks I will frape her. Although she has gone through her phone with me, there has been nothing there. So again, this leads me to just being paranoid.

Things are just starting to pile up, and I am making up stories/scenarios which I know aren't true, but its making me into a mess. I can't help but think that in the heat of the moment, that when she goes, she'll either find someone else and not want me, or like my past, cheat on me, even though I know she won't. 

Can anyone help me stop feeling the way I feel? Or at least suppress these feelings. I try and forgot most things by emerging myself in my work or playing games...but sometimes it just gets too much.

Her mom always checks up on her everytime she isn't with her like when she gets out of work she makes sure she is safe even though I'm with her sometimes and nothing ever happens.  Always either texting or calling.

They always go places together so if the mom has to go out she takes her daughter with.  

This was annoying to me when first going out with her cause it means that I could hardly be with her and plus the mom was mosey where I couldn't even hold hands or be close to her so we never told her that we were dating so we hand to maintain a distance when near her like just being friends.  She would walk quietly down the stairs to see if we were doing something like if we are teens.

That was back then, things have changed where the mom knows we are dating and can hold hands in front of her but there are things that are still problematic.  I won't go into other details of what happens in the past because it's unnecessary.

Back then and now though I'm not allowed in her room even if the door is opened.  She also wasn't allowed in my house cause my mom was the same where they hold us back from doing what we want.  My mom passed away but I feel like my house is too embarrassing to come into since her house is always clean and my house looks looks horrible compared to it plus other problems in which aren't necessary to talk about.

They all went on vacation but the daughter had to come back early because she has a job and the don't (medical problems) so many times a day she contacts her to see if she's ok and I just want time alone with her without any interruptions but it always seems like she's texting her to keep check on her.  If she doesn't text back the mom gets worried and bitches.

Also, her mom has contacted her neighbor friend to keep and make sure I don't go into her house because she's afraid of people calling her daughter a slut/whore/something bad but no one even knows they are gone and probably don't care.  We hardly had sex in the 4 years of dating and we would both like to have romance but never can because of all the problems and never get privacy.  We had to do it in a park where no one ever goes just to have some type of romance.

I was wanting to go to Atlantic city for my vacation and spend the night over there and she would love to go by the mom gets scared and wants to tag along to spend it with us so nothing happens yet I always make sure to be safe myself.  I always carry mace around on the streets and make it quickly accessible for just in case reasons... I don't like guns because when people get scared and shoot off a gun, you can't undo a mistake.

Most guys would have broke up with a girl if they had to deal with the same things I've had to deal with within the first few months/years of dating.

Is there a way for her to show her mom she's fine on her own and not have the mom constantly checking up on her?  I'm afraid if I ever lived in a house with her that she would want to move in with us.

I also don't know what subreddit to place this in, but I am in desperate need of advice. I don't want to put this in /r/Nightmares because they're going to direct to elsewhere or not take it seriously, or I don't want to place this in depression because I'm not affiliated. This is neuroscience, not abnormal psychology! Gaaah, help.

I have been constantly complaining to my friends about my terrible, terrrrible nightmares everytime I close my eyes. It could be for just a minute that they're close, or even for the whole entire night. Most nights, however, I'd have a nightmare for a while and once that one is over, I'd be forced to wake up just to fall back asleep into another nightmare. I have never in my life suffered from depression or any type of traumatizing experience. I have never been diagnosed with any type of psychological issue. All my life I had over-achieved in school, studied an extraordinarily amount of languages(computer programming, dead and spoken) and have had healthy, happy long-term relationships. When a relationship is over, it's over. I have never been abused physically as well as mentally and emotionally. 

To note, I have been playing video games for over 15 years, but that I don't feel is in any way related. I have never touched any type of drugs, prescription medication of any sort, or alcohol. I don't watch movies - just about ever, and especially no horror or thriller films. I laugh too often. I'm a musician. I have really good health and I would consider myself to be an attractive, down-to-earth and easy going woman. I don't see what gives!

I don't know what in this world I should do. I feel like the nightmares are happening to all the wrong person. The nightmares are not even related to me. They have nothing to do with abuse, they have nothing to do with my family and only one of them is related to a relationship, but with a guy I don't even know! The dreams follow a consistency, which is of high level of intelligence and skill, which ultimately leads to death. This has nothing to do with shooting, or drugs or anything of any kind.. It's just.. Odd. It just doesn't make any sense. It doesn't have a single thing to do with my life.

I feel like I'm living someone else's nightmares. But the problem is.. That I've been dealing with it for two months straight and sometimes I'd wake up crying or sweating or sometimes I wake up feeling that I'm going to have a heart attack. But I'd go off and live happy the rest of the day. I'm starting to not like sleeping. I went to look up a similar situation, but only one existed, but it didn't really fit. 

I don't know what in this world I should do. I don't even know much about the psychological field outside of abnormal psychology. Who do I even go to about this? I don't even really want to go through this. I feel like this is all happening to the wrong person. I have not even done anything.

These past few months, my life felt like it had something missing. And I didn't know what, but one day, I talked it out with myself and thought I had the answer. I was content. The pursuit of happiness was no longer there because I was perfectly happy with what I had. So I figured I'd work to be more happy and I wouldn't feel like anything's missing anymore.

So it's early July. School just let out, which is kind of shitty, at least for me. I'm a huge extrovert. I love being around other people, and I'm also good in school. I don't take it seriously, which might come to bite me in the ass later on, but I skate by on pretty good grades. Which means school for me is a six-hour-long day where I get to fuck around, make jokes with my friends, and just hang out. It's also a great opportunity to make friends, and make plans for outside school. As much as I hated the actual school part, I loved the social aspect.

Now that school's out, I don't have that. I can hang out with people outside of school, but it's a lot harder to make plans and stuff. But the thing is, I don't really want to. ""What the fuck,"" you're saying, ""he said he was an extrovert!"" Yeah, but my problem is that I'm not feeling the same way about my friends as I did before. I only have a few that live close enough to actually see them on a regular basis, and for some reason, I just don't like them anymore. The longer I go without talking to someone, the more I start to resent them. I have no idea why, but it gets to the point where I don't even want to be around them. And it sucks.

There's one girl. She's my really close friend. I see her almost every day now, which is nice. I love spending time with her and I know she feels the same way about me. It's not a relationship situation, that's not what I'm talking about. But I feel like she's the only person left that I can stand. She's one of a few close friends I actually have, and the other ones I haven't seen since school let out because they live relatively far away. And I'm not saying she's not enough, but I'm just bummed that I seem to have lost all my other friends.

I know I could have the others back if I wanted to. But that's my problem; I just don't. I tried today, and I was just mad the whole time because I couldn't stand the person anymore. I want to learn to like people. I've never been like this; my philosophy has always been to like people until they give me a reason to dislike them, and all of these friends certainly haven't. I have to learn to like people. Every little thing they do makes me so mad it makes me never want to see them.

It probably sounds like I'm rambling about things that don't matter. I'm not even sure why I feel so... defeated lately. Bottom line is, I lost my friends, and it's my fault, but it wasn't a conscious decision, and my head says I'm okay with it, but I still have this feeling of something missing.

I am in a 1 1/2 year relationship with a M (26) Long Island native that is going well so far. However, my life is getting complicated fairly quickly and I need to figure out what I want from life.
Since January I have carried around this immense painful homesickness in my heart. I have mentioned it to my bf a few times but other than that no one has any idea. I have never missed my home state more than I have for the past six months and I really do believe I will be happier if I moved there. There are career opportunities and such for me there. I miss almost everything about my home state. What is especially concerning is that my parents are getting older and I worry that I am not spending enough time with them (I live on the East Coast and the are on the West Coast so I basically never see them). I feel guilty and like I will regret not spending time with them later on. My mother was unexpectedly checked into the hospital two weeks ago. My reaction was clearcut fear, regret and worry. It wasn't a high stakes situation (gallstones) but a more severe version of this could happen at any time. I just feel like I shouldn't have to rearrange my entire life to give my family some fact-to-face time ESPECIALLY when medical emergencies happen. Also if something did happen, all I could say I do with my family members is phone calls and emails and I don't think I'm satisfied with that. Mostly I am staying in New York right now because I have this boyfriend and a job I started in January. If those two things did not exist I think I would be back in my home state by now.

I do love my boyfriend, that said when I think about a future with him I really wonder if we have a viable shot at building a life together. Not because he's a bad person but because we value different things in life for example:

money: I save and hoard as much as I can while he doesn't give a second thought to spending and doesn't budget at all. He does work very hard in a well-paying industry so I think he feels like he should not have to worry about things like that. I admire his work ethic, for example he worked all day saturday and sunday on top of his usual 60 hours a week. no judgement from me but....

work-life balance: Should we both keep our current career courses, he will work even more hours and I probably will keep to a 40 hour a week schedule. So if we have kids like he wants to, most of the work would fall to me, although he would be making tons of money to make up for that. My parents were in a situation like that and they had an awful divorce when I was five so I'm not sure a situation like that can work as easily as he thinks it will. He has also said that he wants to hire a maid to handle childcare and so on but I can't count on him holding that same opinion for like ten more years (when we would actually be starting a family), or for our financial situation to allow that in ten more years. Also if I am going to raise a family, my partner's day-to-day presence will be very important to me as it will be to the kids and I don't think he has thought about the value of his presence with the family. I don't think he's being sexist I just think that he is not thinking through the reality of the weight of these responsibilities and how he will work with a partner through them. This worries me because I plan ahead on these things and I really don't want to repeat my parents' mistakes. Not to mention that I will be seeing less and less of him anyways as he progresses in his career because of the crazy schedules he will get. At what point is it worth to continue a long term relationship with someone if you only see them for a few hours one night a week? I feel like his job will eventually push me out of his life at some point.

Romance: Our sex life is great but I definitely feel like I am putting more effort into this relationship than he is. I live in Inwood upper Manhattan and he lives in the Financial District (one hour subway ride at least). I am always going to his place and hanging out with his buddies, because he doesn't want to come up to my place and ""forgets"" when I have scheduled time for him to meet some of my friends. He is a great communicator and while he can be really petty with his friends and family, he always goes the extra mile to make sure him and I work problems out. Also I should add that he told many friends that he was looking into moving to Texas without even bothering to tell me first so I guess it wouldn't be the end of his world if I moved away either, but I'm not completely clear on that either.

Communication: He was raised in a family that speaks combatively to each other, although they are all very sweet kind people. This comes out when arguing with me occasionally and I really try not to take it personally. He can sound extremely cruel, like he thinks I'm stupid and my side of the argument isn't worthy of consideration. In fact, when we get into little spats it shows up sometimes as well. It's not a big deal now but if we build a life together I can see this as really being a problem for me. I have seen him straight-up lie to good friends/family members of his over important things and little details to ""impress"" others-this also gives me pause.

He is extremely status-oriented and subscribes to very traditional male heterosexual norms while I tend to question traditional gender norms. I see this even when his friends are gone and we are alone together. It's not the kind of things that bothers me a lot now but should we get more serious I would have difficulties with it.

Are all of these problems irreconcilable? or is there potential to work through them?

So I love him and we share a pure love together but I have these doubts about the future and I don't want to call it quits until I know for sure that I will not regret leaving him and the East Coast behind. I love him and I don't want to cause him any pain. I really don't want to hurt him especially now he brings up marriage with me on his own and our future and seems to sincerely want these things. He has said that he is open to moving to California but I doubt that he will actually do it considering that his family, friends and career (finance) are all based in New York. 

My family are all divided on the issue. So I don't even know if they would support me moving back. 

I feel torn apart, sad and completely lost in how I should handle all of these issues. I don't feel any attachment to New York and I just want to feel like I finally have my life on track since I feel so lost.

At first I thought it would be a temporary situation for a few months.  8 years ago I moved away to another city, got married, had kids.  My parents paid rent (25% below market rate) for 4 years, then because of the downturn in the economy their business dried up.  So 
they haven't paid for 4 years now.  The mortgage is a lot of money and we can't afford it on top of all our other expenses.  We have to draw down our savings to pay it.  My parents own 2 other properties.  They are both currently rented.  One of the properties has some land and they are trying to sell it.  They are really dragging 
their feet on getting the property sold.  It could have been put on the market 6 months ago but they kept finding things they wanted to do before listing it for sale.  I'm getting really fed up with this situation.  I've told them numerous times what our financial situation is.  They always say they are trying to get their property sold so they can buy a house to live in.  I don't quite want to give my parents an 
ultimatum but this is getting ridiculous.  They are not poor since they have assets, but they have little cash flow because they manage their money rather poorly.  We would probably keep the house and rent it out since it would have positive cash flow with a market rate rent.  

What would you do in a situation like this?

I shrugged it off and went to bed since it was late. This morning I walked back into the living room and realized that it smelled mildly of vomit. It also smelled particularly strong in the kitchen, which is connected to the living room by a hallway. None of our bedrooms seems to smell, as far as I can tell. It's easy to detect the smell upon immediately entering the room, but it goes away quickly, so it's hard to sniff down the source once you've picked up on it.

We just moved into this apartment last weekend. No one was partying here this weekend and none of my room mates have vomited in the house.

I asked one of my room mates about this, and he said that he had been smelling it since last week and that it had only gotten worse (I didn't smell it when I left the apartment Thursday night, it's now Tuesday afternoon). My other room mate believed it was the refrigerator. 

Is there anything that would particularly cause this smell other than actual vomit? My hunch is leaning towards something in the fridge going bad, so I'm working on cleaning it out right now and disinfecting it. Any other clues would be appreciated.

UPDATE: Not sure if I was supposed to put this here or in the comments section, but I just posted this update in the comments section. Here is the full text:

Discovered the source of the smell. I originally thought it was coming from the fridge, since that is where the smell is strongest. It is actually coming from behind the clothes washer, which is located right next to it in our kitchen (our utilities are all located right in the kitchen area). I haven't figured out if it's coming from the washer itself, or if its something inside the wall behind the washer.

I had a female friend over last night and she smelled it too. I immediately associate the smell with vomit, but she seemed to associate it with a wet dog smell. She also suggested it was a moldy smell. My room mate simply described it as a 'funk.'

So my next question is: What would make a washer smell that bad. There's no old clothes inside of it, but it definitely smells very moldy. Is there some sort of proper maintenance that we are overlooking? Is it just old and needs to be replaced? Or might there be a leak inside of the wall and something funky is growing inside of it?

Not usually my style to ask Reddit for help, but I'm caught in a conundrum and hope you can help. Basically my 2 best friends and I have had a falling out and I have no idea how to reconcile. Basically they were mocking my girlfriend to me for changing her cover photo on Facebook to a picture of me and my daughter - calling her ""creepy"" and other various things synonymous with their dislike for her. They've always said things like ""you can do better"" and raised questions to her financial security as I have a well paid job and prospects whereas they see her as a drain upon me.

The thing is, she's never been anything but nice to them - she's always tried to make them feel welcome, one in particular who when he had nowhere to live, we allowed him to live with us for 3 months and although we charged him rent, it was far below the actual expense. She didn't bat an eyelid, cooked, cleaned up after him etc.

I don't think they understand that I love her she's great with my little girl and we live happy life, and I proposed to her in March, causing one in particular to go mad at me.

Anyway, back to the argument. We had the argument on Skype, and I do have anger management issues, particularly when someone who can't defend themselves is being made a mockery of I see it as bullying. All my friend has done since having her on Facebook has been to argue with her and criticise everything she does to me. The other (who lived with us) shocked me by joining in. This isn't an isolated incident, they constantly mock and berate her and have done since I've been with her.

They genuinely believe they have my best interests at heart and have likened the situation to me being blunt in my advice that (the one who lived with us) his boyfriend was controlling him and making him unhappy. I see this as a different situation. This is them calling her names because she changed a cover photo.

Anyway, I blocked them on Skype, deleted them on Facebook - told one if he was here I'd break his legs and the other that he should never contact me again as I was done. Now that a week has passed, they have deleted and blocked me from Steam/Origin, blocked me on Whatsapp, permanently banned me from the Teamspeak server we use. I have no method of contacting them. They haven't apologised, or even attempted to. Now when I've extended the olive branch I'm being ignored. I still feel they have no right to act this way towards me, they were in the wrong - yes I flipped out, but they are the ones who instigated the situation and they are the ones who are blocking me all over the show. I deleted them on Facebook and blocked them on Skype - what right do they have to block me all over the place?

I would have died for these two people, their actions have shown me that they didn't see me as much of a friend in the first place.

I feel empty and I cry all the time. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't think I'm incredibly ugly, I'm a nice girl and I like to read and watch movies, I'm funny..

Now for the long-winded part:

I played piano when I was younger and I would love to do it again, but I won't be able to pay for lessons. My mom let me quit (I'm not placing blame here) things when I was younger (piano, dancing, singing, acting, etc), so I think I have some kind of mental block about having/doing something I can say that I'm ""good"" at.
Many kids had an instrument/hobby that they practiced enough to compete with, which gave them a sense of accomplishment when they worked hard at it. I never had something like this, and I think I've turned into a lazy fuck because of it. I tried re-learning piano the other day and just gave up after an hour and went to go watch TV.

I have to be fairly vague in case people I know see this as frankly I don't know how to talk to anyone about all of this. I'm completely broke and am struggling to even find part-time (let alone full-time) work - even though my resume includes fairly extensive experience in technology and in situations that require responsibility and dedication - just so I can save up enough money to take a single course this fall and finish my degree. I've applied to dozens of places in two towns and received one call, had an interview and it went great but there's no ""would you like to come in on day x"" despite being told I'd hear from them in a week, and every time I check in it seems like there are fewer potential hours to be had. 

I've also been depressed for years to the point where I'm thinking about suicide more and more and regretting ever accepting some cancer treatments that saved my life when I was younger. The only reason I probably haven't ended it already is because I'm too afraid I'm going to hurt the few people I still have as close friends and family, and leave a ton of student loan debt behind for them to deal with. I already made a decision a few years ago that if I was still constantly feeling like this when I was nearing 30 (I'm 25 now), I'd suicide after working to pay my debts down as much as possible or something because I don't want to be a sad or bitter and lonely old man. It's getting to the point where I just don't believe things are ever going to get better because it seems like I just keep falling further in the hole every time I try to climb out. I break down constantly and avoid spending a lot of time with people because I don't want anyone to see it. I don't want to seek mental help and don't want medication and really don't want to end up on something like suicide watch or whatever.

To top it all off, I've fallen really hard over the past year and a half for a girl who is the best friend I've ever had. Most of my friends have been distant or friends of convenience or seemed to be using me or were in some way abusive (I appeared to be the guy they'd fall back on if they had no one else to hang out with and generally got left behind whether it was in gym class, going out to parties, or whatever; when I did get to hang out I'd often be made fun of or chosen as the scapegoat for whatever bullshit ideas they had), but not her. She is probably the sweetest girl I've ever met and is always there when I'm feeling like shit and always seems to know the kind of stuff that'll make me laugh or cheer me up at least a little. Honestly, days where I've hung out with her for even a few minutes have been the best days I've had for a really long time and I'm afraid of becoming that needy, desperate friend in her life, especially when I know we're probably just going to stop seeing each other in a year or so when everyone moves away after school. I feel so guilty about these feelings and would just tell her but she's in a long-term relationship that seems to make her quite happy and she's got a really bright future ahead of her with him even if she did like me back. I understand that this looks like the typical sad crush/unhealthy infatuation but I don't know how else to put it. It makes me feel weak and selfish that I feel this way about someone who gives a shit about me but is already taken.

Any advice is appreciated. I'm lost to the point where I can't even focus on things or express myself clearly. Looking back on what I just wrote it seems stupid but I don't know what else to write. I'm so fucking frustrated.

EDIT: Adding more info I guess. My dad is currently supporting me while I find a job but I don't understand why because he seems to take all of his shit out on me and never wants to talk to me about anything except his new girlfriend (my mother is in late-stage dementia and I was not particularly close to her; when I was young she would embarrass me in front of girls I brought home, tell my friends' parents that I was a nasty, messy and generally bad child so I'd never be allowed to go visit, and seemed to flat-out stop caring about who I was or what I wanted to do once it was clear I wasn't going to be a doctor and make lots of money to send to her). He makes my sister and I feel like garbage all of the time because he keeps talking about how much fun he's having with her and how she's the ""only happiness he has in his life"", berating us for wanting to do this or that with our lives and then turning around in a two-faced manner and talking to her about us like he's so proud and happy and supportive. My sister is on the other side of the country and definitely cares but we've both had a pretty fucked up middle-class life that definitely looks better from the outside than it really is (she got it worse when we were young, was essentially a prisoner in our house until her late teens). 

Looking at it myself, it seems like every time I was sad or lonely when I was younger my parents would buy us toys to try and placate us, and when I got a little older and started having summer jobs I'd waste all of my money on movies and games and things like MtG cards trying to feel a little better about myself. I always ended up feeling the same way again though. Now it seems like I can't really get close to people with the exception of the people I've mentioned already and I can't even remember how the friendship with the best friend came to be (I can't remember when we started hanging out or what prompted it). I spent a lot of time by myself during and after treatments in my hometown where I didn't really have anyone to talk to except some pretty miserable and petty ""friends"" whose idea of a good time was getting blackout drunk and picking on me for whatever excuse they could find.

I was reconnected with an old high school acquaintance via Facebook.I am now 22 and he, we'll call him Jim, is 23. Little by little our talks became flirtatious. Only problem was that I attend college 6 hours away. We skyped while I was away at school, he came to see me and we were able to go on an actual date. We talk everyday for months, unfortunately during that time we exchange nude photos. (because I am an idiot) Everything was awesome, when I came home the next time we actually have sex. Then came the red flags. When I went back to school, we'd talk like normal. Then when I would go out to the bars with my friends he'd send me heated jealous texts. I figured he was just the jealous type and brushed it off. Regardless we were both on the same level that we were keeping things casual. Then the texts got a little worse like: ""who'd you fuck last night?"" and ""You're such a lier about being a good girl?"" (hooking up with Jim so quickly and the way it happened is very much not my typical behavior, and something I had never done before. I made him very aware of this) Once again I just have my guard up figuring he is just very jealous.
Then the big one comes:
He comes to visit, stays with friend the first night and has a hotel for us the next night. When he first arrives he texts saying he is going to pick me up in an hour. He never arrives. I call him thinking something had gone terribly wrong. The phone call pretty much goes,telling me to calm the fuck down, don't be such a bitch, fuck off I am with my friends) I was livid, I don't stand to be spoken to that way, not only that but the logic that came with it was so bizarre. You don't tell someone you'll see them in an hour and never show up. On top of that I had to move around meetings at my work, inconveniencing others, to be able to see him (he was aware of this). I was completely embarrassed. 

He is finally done having his guy time and wants to come get me, I am still very upset and say no. Finally he apologizes and I get over it. Later that night we meet at a bar, he brings his friends, I bring mine. He then proceeds to get extremely intoxicated. Making a fool out of himself, attempting to start fights,and calling people (including me) profanities. I am once again extremely embarrassed this is ""the guy"" I have told my friends all about. I literally ditch him and my friends and I go to the next bar over. He finds me apologizes again and I am willing to table it till the morning. He goes off with his friends and stumbles back to me later in the night at the same bar. He then proceeds to attempt to grab my breasts, shove his hands down my pants, and make out with any part of my face he can get close to. I am resisting when he finally leans in and bites me extremely hard on the apple of my cheek. I threw a right hook like you wouldn't believe and that was it. I headed home with my friends to my own place. 

The next day I wake up to a ""come outside text"" full with with flowers and on hands and knees apology, claiming how embarrassed and out of character it was. ( I go soft, sorry guys) Spend the night in the hotel with him. We have some fun, but when we aren't having fun, we bicker non-stop about the night before. Suddenly the apology wasn't so whole hearted and I was ""asking for it to be a bad time"". The weekend ends, I make it clear we will not be seeing each other ever again.

We fight a few more times by text. Each time full of insults toward me and then later apologizing claiming it is because he loves me sooooo much. I'm still very much done. I come home again and all I can think about is the nude photos. We hangout so, after heavy convincing get him to let me remove the nude photos from every nook and cranny I see available. Then I cut off all communication. I am now flooded by insulting texts. I ignore the majority of them, unless I feel colorful then I respond with logic. 

Text start from him: You need to let me see you . I respond with things like: why should I see you if you say such awful things. Then he responds: I love you and I just get so worried I won't see you again. I respond: I won't be treated or talk to the way you do. He responds: by calling me a names threatening me with the photos or whatever. then telling me he loves me, then asking me to come over so ""we can fuck"". The cycle continues over and over again. 

His texts are getting more and more irrational, threatening to show up at my house, insults are getting more and more colorful. 

He is literally bipolar, a text one second says I am a bitch, slut, fucking every dude in town till I die. I need a vibrator because no one will love me. The next text no later than 30 seconds later is, I love you,come over, I miss you. 

I don't know what to do. I am so scared of his irrational behavior. I am worried he is going to do something to me or my house in the hometown where we both live. I am scared of him. I am scared if I continue to not respond he will go ape shit.

What do I do? Am I crazy to be so paranoid?

I've been in love (or in love with being in love) with a girl that has been my best friend for 13 years. We grew up together and shared really difficult moments together. We have a strong bond, kissed a few times during that period, never got together and both wondered. 

I started dating this amazing girl senior year of college, we eventually moved in together and have been together for a total of nearly 4 years, friends for 3 years before that. 

During our relationship, there was usually one thing or another that I wasn't totally honest about, and I sometimes didn't put her first or think about how my actions would effect her. For maybe the last year and a half I've been talking to that best friend about the fantasy life we envision and being together (emotional affair), which my girlfriend could sense, and I tried to mitigate because I wasn't ready to lose her. Our communication problems kept us from thinking about a future together, kept us from connecting, and helped me focus on ""why it just wasn't working"". She asked me if I was going to break up with her two weeks ago, I said yes and since then we've spoken a lot about everything. I've come clean about every feeling I've had for my best friend, that we were on a date about a week ago, my anxieties etc. Our communication has been awesome, she's said that this is the person she wanted to be with, and how turned on she's been with me since I've been honest and really shared with her. We broke down and had sex four times in two days, which is a record for us.

Now I'm really in a funk because I'm caught between two women's expectations, on one hand I want to know what it would be like to be with my best friend. On the other hand I think being communicative and open with my girlfriend would totally change our relationship for the better. 

**Summation in the form of a question: Should I date my best friend (who I may be in love with being in love with) or give my old relationship a legitimate chance of success by investing in it, and friend-zoning my feelings for that best friend, possibly losing her friendship altogether?**

I used to see my school therapist up until I graduated. I never saw the boy again and a year ago I got over the pain. I started getting crushes on new boys since then and each one of them gave me anxiety, because they never reciprocated the feelings. I used to not be able to stop thinking about the boys in my life, but I cut all ties 6 months ago and have stopped thinking about them.

My problem in the present day now is that I feel slightly discontent with my life. When I hear anything about relationships/marriage or see it on TV, I don't get anxiety, but I do ponder the thoughts for a good minute. They are really uncomfortable thoughts, they used to be anxious thoughts two months ago.

I am an only child, and I thought the problem was boredom, (which I still think it is) but I go to school, study, hang out with my friends, party once a month, play videogames, make new people, relax, talk to my family and etc. So I'm doing all that I can with my life, but i am still discontent. I don't have anxiety or depression, but instead discontent with life in general (sorry for overusing discontent). Infact, I can't remember the last time I was completely enjoying the present day. I think it was before I got heartbroken... I don't really know.

Going to new places is my passion, and I know this because whenever I leave my hometown (Texas) I feel immersed in my environment and I feel fun and great. I feel as not traveling is the root of my discontent, but I can't be too sure.

I feel as if the people around me are content and happier, for example, my younger cousin who is an only child seems happy with the way her life is going, so i don't know why it's happening to me..

So my question is.. I don't have anxiety or depression symptoms (well, atleast not the feel really bad symptoms) but should I go to a therapist or does everyone feel this way in life? Do you have any personal advice you can give me for my situation?
I have been feeling this way for 3 years now, it's bearable but a constant annoyance/discomfort, and if i can live like everyone around me, than i think life would be better.

I will try to keep it concise, but it is confusing to me, so it will probably come out confusing anyway. I don't really feel that attached to people. I love people in general, and I would do anything for the people in my life, but if they were to walk away from our friendship or move away or something, I am not sure it would bother me. I feel...kinda detached from everything. In general I do what I think I need to, what the people around me need me to do, but all I do when alone is try and analyze why I do the things I do, why I behave that way, what I could have been thinking to do it. I know that makes it sound like I am doing crazy weird things, but I am not, I help people out, not overly much, I listen, I provide sound advice when asked, give fair judgements (most of the time). At times this analyzing makes me feel like two people, there is one acting and doing things being all normal and shit, and there is the observer who offers criticisms, critiques, analyses, and whatnot every once in a while, breaking himself down just trying to figure it out. 

This only happens once every few weeks or so, where it gets so bad, i can't stop my brain and it just keeps going and going, trying to figure it all out, I overanalyze every word I speak, I don't enjoy whatever I am doing at the time. I get crazy worked up over it all, I often seem to try and convince myself I am crazy, while at the same time fighting it, I argue over it in my head. 

When with people, my emotional state is generally that of the crowd, or at least an energetic happy type in an attempt to bring them up, if a serious person is needed, thats what I am. On my own, I don't really feel much or anything really. I watch a lot of tv and movies, or listen to music...now i am thinking so I have something to emote to but who knows.

When it comes to all this, I make sure not to tell many/any people about it, they have their own problems and should not be burdened with it. I do share little tidbits with some people, but never anyone in the same time zone as me, and never that much info with any in particular. I just don't trust them with the info.

Again, not sure what I wanted or want out of this. I just at least needed to get it out. whatever insight there may be, I will answer any question posed of me on this, I am mostly curious as to basically what anyone else thinks on it, sorry it was long winded

Which college should I go to?,5,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fi7zw/i_really_need_help_making_a_huge_decision_which/,"I've been out of high school for a very long time now. I've been sitting around spinning my wheels because I'm terrified of making a decision.
My boyfriend lives in a different state... A state that I'm not entirely familiar with and don't see a whole lot of allure to. But, if I go to school there, I get a scholarship for 100% tuition. I want to be a psychiatrist, so obviously if I think about medical school and everything else I'll need to go through, saving money is a huge factor. The LAST thing I need is to be thousands of dollars in debt going into medical school, which will put me in thousands more. Also, obviously, another perk is that I'll be closer to my boyfriend and he really has been a blessing. But I'd really regret making this decision based solely on our relationship, no matter how things turn out.

I've also been accepted to a school in Georgia, which is my home. Why I'm considering there is self explanatory. It's comfortable, and I love it more than I can say. I have plenty of friends there and have planned my life there hundreds of times since I was a little girl. But there's no scholarship involved. However, my federal grants and military tuition assistance pretty much covers the school I want to go to anyway.

My third choice is the choice I truly believe I want. But I don't know if it's the right one. You see, ever since before I could walk I've been a singer. And by the time I was 5 I had already starred in my first play. I spent the next 12 years of my life truly believing I would be an actress. I was seriously passionate about it. Through high school I averaged 60 hours a week inside of a theatre, and even held a position on the state board of thespians and was recognized many, many times for my performances at the state and regional level. My plan senior year was to run off to New York right after graduating and give myself a year to find out if I could make it... Needless to say, I chickened out and changed my major and decided to put it all behind me. But I never stopped regretting that. I fear I'll live the rest of my life regretting it if I don't at least go to school there. My tuition would be paid for and all I'd have to worry about would be food and a place to live... But of course, that's a big thing to worry about somewhere as expensive as NYC. Besides money, it's just a scary decision. I'd be moving to a place knowing no one, and no idea what I'm getting into. I'm a small girl, and it's a dangerous city. I can't pretend that just because I 'd have tuition taken care of, it's not still a huge risk. Not to mention the fact that this may mean the end of my relationship and, probably, most of my friendships. Let's face it, absence doesn't always make the heart grow fonder... 

But should I just go for it? Or go home? Or go take a chance on a relationship? 

Oh, and because I am in the military... Changing schools isn't really an option. Whatever I pick has to be my 4 year choice. There's just a lot of contract stuff involved... But yeah, that's about it. This decision will affect the next couple years of my life and then some. Talk about pressure.

1369971595.0,4,self.Advice,1fdtgc,Major Self-Worth Issues,5,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fdtgc/major_selfworth_issues/,"Hello, Reddit. I'm a 16 year old girl who has massive issues with confidence, self worth, and I struggle daily with associating myself with importance.
I suppose some background is necessary for me to completely explain this problem I have. 

Sorry for the upcoming wall of text. There's a TL;DR at the end.

My father is an awful person, despite having been a preacher in the past. He had multiple affairs while married to my mother, one of them becoming intimate with a member of the youth group (who was barely legal) about a few months after I was born and my older brother (we'll call him T) turned 3. Shortly after, the girl said she was pregnant and claimed him to be the father, later proved by a DNA test. My parents divorced shortly after, when I was 7. The baby became my half sister (we'll call her O) that T and I never knew about until the ages of 10 and 13. 

Before my parents even divorced, I knew things were rocky... Well, as far as a little girl could. I knew Mommy and Daddy fought a lot, and Daddy would make Mommy cry, then Daddy would go drink his 'grown up soda' (alcohol). During this time, I went through a phase where I oddly favored my father. I still saw him as my big, strong daddy who would protect me and love me. Boy, was I wrong... Turns out, my father never wanted a daughter, so that was his motive to not like me. He would constantly push me away if I ever tried to hug him, and anything comforting or encouraging I tried to say to him was met with a snarky and hurtful remark. He cast me out and made me feel like I was not loved by him. However, my father had an acute interest in T. He would pamper my brother and always attend his sporting events as well as give him practically anything he ever wanted. He referred to T as his favorite child on a daily basis... And it always seemed to be while I was around, like he was intentionally saying it within my earshot. T was not arrogant towards me and has always been a loving big brother, but seeing him get all my father's positive attention 

Fast forward to age 10 when I met my half sister, O, who was 9 at the time, for the first time ever. She and I were close almost instantly... But even she had my father's favor. He also gave her practically anything she wanted: even things that I said I wanted, but he gave to her instead. His reason? ""She's your little sister, she should get it. You have to work for it."" Around this time now, my father began to not hold T on such a high pedestal. Whenever T and I would go visit our father after finding out about O, he would subtly tell us that she was the favorite now. He became very verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive towards us, while sparing O of his wrath. He belittled my brother by saying he would never be a true man and things of that nature, and he would call me everything under the sun: stupid, bitch, idiot, whore, slut, insignificant, etc. He continually told me variations of ""You're not important to me and you're not important to anybody else. Everybody pities you and nobody is really your friend. How could they when they have to hang around an absolute idiot slut like you?"" Being 10, I assumed he was right and knew what he was talking about since he was (supposed to be) the adult. Gradually I stopped speaking and began to constantly deny myself of things I thought were meant for ""people who mattered"", like food when I was hungry. Sure, I'd eat, but only bits here and there, because I thought that other people in the house need to eat more than I need to since I wasn't important or didn't matter. Looking back on it, it doesn't make much sense now, but that was my logic until I was 12, and it made me very thin and feeble. My father essentially made me feel like I was below everyone else and unlike a human being.

I never said anything about the abuse to my mother since my warped logic figured that I would only cause her stress and make her angry by bothering her with my ""dumb and insignificant problems"". But she's a wonderful mother and caught wind that something was wrong by my lack of speaking, eating, sleeping, and my newly acquired skittish behavior (shying away from hugs or any physical contact since I didn't feel I deserved it, still thinking I was inferior to everyone). She pressed me long enough and I finally told her what my father had been saying to me and my brother. I don't know exactly what she did after that, but we weren't allowed to see him anymore and I believe she got a restraining order against him. I don't really know though, I don't care enough to ask about him.

Ever since then, I've been trying to get my confidence, self-esteem, and self worth back. But I don't know how and I still struggle daily with how I view myself. My best friend (we'll call her D) supports me and reassures me that I'm important and I matter, but I don't see it. My struggles include being afraid to ask for help (no matter how much I really need it), withholding my problems from my family and friends since I don't want to bother/bore/stress them by sharing my burden. I take things away from myself just so others can be happy or stress-free: an example is not going out with my friends since I feel it's a hassle and an extreme annoyance to have me around. I don't trust people easily either. I tell people that I'm fine and happy when they ask, but I'm not, yet I can't bring myself to put a damper on their day by saying anything else but ""I'm fine"". It's weird, I know. I also barely ever speak when I am with a group of people for fear that the sound of my voice will annoy them or be a reason they don't like me around, since that's what my father always told me: that the sound of my voice is like nails on a chalkboard to everybody.

I just want to know how I can get my confidence and self-esteem/worth back. I'm sick of living in this vicious, hurtful and lonely cycle. I don't want to try a therapist since I've had a few bad experiences with those concerning this very topic, such as one that I finished talking to leaving the room and whispering to a co-worker nearby ""We've got another crazy emo"". Help me find myself again.

**TL;DR: My verbally, emotionally, and maybe even mentally abusive father convinced me that I'm not important and that I don't matter to the point of me not being able to fully enjoy my life because I'm constantly worried about whether I'm bothering someone/being a hassle/stressing them out/burdening them with sharing my problems/etc. It's best if you read the whole thing for a better explanation.**

I want to get in better shape. I'm not fat by any means really, I have some chub but that's about it. I figure if I eat better and exersice more I'd be a happier person. 

I want to become a better student. I don't want to be lazy anymore and just try squeeking by on everything. I'm retaking my math over the summer and I want to retake the SATs in the Fall. 

I want to be happier. I just want to be happy. I'm great at making people laugh and I love doing it. I'm always that ""Its half empty"" guy though, I'd rather be that ""Half full"" guy.

In my freshman year I took Algebra I, and discovered my love for math. So, I self studied Geometry and tested-out of that class.

But my school has informed me that even if I get a perfect score on the pre-calculus exam, they will still make me take pre-calculus my junior year. And that is just pre-calculus, I want to get into AP calculus, but they wont even let me take standard level calculus.

I've been told that they require me take pre-calculus in class (so testing out doesn't count). Which is fine because I can cope with taking pre-calculus over the break at my local community college as long as I can take a more advanced class when I get back to school. But of course, they don't count that either.

However, it has been greatly disappearing during the last couple of years. :) Currently, I possess the most confidence I have had my entire life.

I was diagnosed with aspergers in my teens, but not sure how accurate that is.  (selective-mutism before that)  I feel that public schools f**ked me over. I only have a ""certificate of completion"". I am preping to take the GED, however my math skills are very lacking.

I've only worked menial jobs, retail, pizza delivery, but want something more. I'm really into tech, but am not completely sold on the tech support role. Mainly it's because I'm not sure AT ALL of the career path/options beyond that.

Part of my problem is that I lack drive to get ahead. Of course this is mostly my own doing. Only I and I alone can determine my future. 

I want to move to a new city because I feel that it will help me psychologically.  Remember the ""buffer zone"" talk from Seinfeld?: 

&gt;Jerry: You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this.
&gt;
&gt;Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self
&gt;
&gt;confidence than you ever dreamed of.

Sounds crazy, but I think this applies to me. I love my family and all, they're awesome in supporting me, but I just need to get away.  I need to get as far out of my ""safety zone"" as is possible. I feel that thrusting myself into a completely new environment may be just what I need.  It will force me to be more self reliant than ever. Being in a new city will force me to be social.

Currently live near Boston. City has its positives, but I am sick and tired of New England winters. Winter depresses me, literally. Think I suffer from SAD. 

I have nothing holding me down here and do have money saved up. I literally want to pack up and drive cross the country. I've had this dream for about four years now. I'm basically at the point where I feel like I could pack up and head out tomorrow. Literally tomorrow. 5/29.

My ""dream city"" before was San Antonio. Visited there with family on a vacation in 2007 and fell in love with the place. The River Walk, OMG. So beautiful. However, lately I've been thinking San Francisco. (Big shocker there, huh?)

At any rate, I'm really itching to get up and go. As I said, I currently have the most confidence I have ever had. Biggest thing that scares me though is finding a job. Now, I am willing to (re-)start from the bottom if that's what it takes.

My reasoning for abstaining is simple- I do not like the meat industry and it's practices, but I really do not feel it is my right to take another life for the enjoyment of food. Meat, although delicious, slightly grosses me out when I think about the living, breathing aspect of it. In my own day to day life, I do not want meat as a food source.

However, all other cultures eat meat to some degree. When I finish my schooling and start travelling the world and studying (and writing books), I don't want to limit myself by abstaining from local cuisine and culture. I am toying with the idea of only eating meat when I am visiting other regions...but I am torn because I feel that is hypocritical of me.

I live at home with my parents because I want to save up to live in a nice place one day. I really would like to move soon, but my mother has told me that everyone in my family lived home until marriage, and she will be heartbroken and disown me if I move out. This is just one of the many ways she controls me. For instance, I came home late for a date (midnight instead of 11) and she freaked out on me- calling me a slut and an immature idiot. She grabbed my phone out of my hand and slapped me. I then slapped her back. I have been dealing with her bouts of anger for years. She always does things like this, so gradually over time I lost respect for her. An incident like tonight when she backhanded me (and left a bruise on my cheek btw) rarely happens anymore, because I'm not a kid anymore.

The clinic where I work does grooming and has a single groomer on staff named Beth. Beth has treated me like shit since day one. When I came in for my interview, she was smoking out back and as I walked by her, she looked at me for the very first time and told me to run away and never look back. It was very Lion King. 

Despite the obvious warning, I stayed on and accepted the position. I've dabbled in every position in the clinic now and have a good feel for what I'm doing with the $150,000 education and all that. Beth brought in a litter of kittens a couple weeks ago and that was fine but then last Friday (a week ago tomorrow) she brought in a second litter and placed them with the first. The second litter immediately started going down hill and one of them died yesterday. Now all of the kittens have diarrhea, dehydration, runny eyes, lethargic. A barrage of symptoms.  Come to find out, she's been giving these sick kittens away in this condition and I told her to cut it out. We have to fix them before any more of them go to new homes. I didn't say it rudely or meanly but she became hostile.

Shortly after that, a couple of elderly women came in to inquire about adopting one of the kittens and I told them the kittens were ill and were not able to go to a new home as of yet, but I would write down their information and let them know when/if the kittens are available. Just as I'm saying this Beth walks in with the kittens, completely ignoring me and goes about trying to get rid of them. I left the room because I was angry at being blatantly ignored and went into the lab to grab my drink and fester by myself.
 
Maybe 5 minutes later, Beth comes up to me with an extremely dirty litter box that obviously hasn't been cleaned in days and rudely says to me ""Are you going to run a fecal on this shit or not?"" and I said ""No."" I was matter of fact, prompt and not rude at all. I just simply said no. She goes off about how I'm an uppity bitch and a cunt and fuck this and fuck that and fuckfuckfuck. She stomped off to the back where grooming is, cussing the whole way about me and proceeds to loudly yell to another co-worker about how much of a fucking know it all bitch I am and that I need to stay the fuck away from her and that she doesn't know if she can control herself because I'm such a bitch to her. 

I said nothing. All day. I called my employer immediately (it's her day off) and told her what was going on. She told me to keep calm, finish my shift and ignore Beth. She would talk to her tomorrow. The problem is it's hard to ignore something so blatant. I don't understand why it's happening.

This has been going on for months. I feel like I'm walking on egg shells every day when I walk through the doors of that place. The other employees just let her say all this stuff about me because it's not just me, I'm just the victim at this moment. They're scared it'll be them next. She doesn't have anyone else to pick on. She makes my life miserable, I come home and I just want to cry and eat a whole bunch of ice cream. It's really starting to effect my self-esteem and that worries me, I've battled low self-esteem all my life and I'm finally feeling okay about myself. I don't know what to do. 

She's been caught stealing, she's been abusing me for months, she does this to anyone in the clinic who doesn't do exactly what she wants and my employers do nothing about it because she brings in roughly $75,000 a year for the clinic. She's been there for 12 years and from what I hear she's always been this way. I just don't know what to do. I've been working less hours to avoid her and am hardly making ends meet anymore, my last paycheck was $380 and I've had to stretch my last $20 until tomorrow which is extremely stressful in itself.

My father came from an abusive household (his mother) and his best friend (his father) died when he was 16. My mom and dad met when they were in their 20's and eventually moved to Pennsylvania to have me. Both my mother and father are physically disabled, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and cerebral palsy respectively. So my mother has extremely limited ways of moving, she used to be able to walk when I was younger but now she's pretty much wheel-chair bound. My father was also hit by a car, and he is very near-sighted (pretty much can't see past his palm) and has a prevalent limp when he walks.

TL;DR - My mom and dad are both disabled and my dad came from an abusive past
-- - - - - -
They moved from Philly to Wilkes-Barre, PA. They had me in 94, my sister, Alyssa in 2000, and brother  William, 2001. We go to private, catholic schools.  My dad was a stay-at-home dad and my mom went to work in Social Security as a typist or something. Life as a child was good, though I remember it being different because my parents couldn't do all the fun things other families could; we were poor and they were disabled, so we couldn't go to amusement parks or hiking trips, etc. I do remember the fighting though. I remember my dad always screaming at my mom before work and I remember him throwing things at her. I remember her not coming back some days, but shed return. Years go by, I think it was 2005 when my mom finally left and never came back.

TL;DR - My mom and dad fought a lot when I was a kid and my mom eventually left.
-- - - - - -
Time goes on and I remember going through custody court and my dad won us (my mom was at a battered woman shelter, and he ""coached"" us to say ""I wanna live with daddy!). Visitation worked out that we were supposed to see my mom for the first three weekends of the month. My dad initially went through with it.

From the time on until I was 14, our house slowly but eventually became a hoarder house (Many grown cats/pregnant cats/kittens). My dad would spend his disability checks on useless things that he think would benefit us. An abundance of furniture with nowhere to put it or he bulk bought food with no room to put it, so it would be stuff-packed into our fridges (yes he bought three and two deep freezers) and would go spoiled and would stink up our house ALONG with the horrifying amount of cat shit that would be around the house. Basically our house went to shit. Along with that, my father made enemies in our neighborhood. I remember tagging along with my dad several times to harassment cases (that I well knew he caused) just to back him up. 
TL;DR - House becomes hoarder house; Dad constantly in/out of court
Now my dad, I wouldn't learn till later, was very manipulative and persuasive. He eventually started abusing me. He never did anything sexually (thank god), but he had no respect for me. I'm not sure when he started treating me badly but I think it was when I started hanging out with friends and going out (probably when I was 14). His money wouldnt go towards the bills or our tuition or our house. He began stressing out about these things and would take it out on me. He'd keep me up on school nights just screaming about the same things (how the house isn't clean, even though it needed a team to get all the filth out; and how he has no money to pay the bills). Those things aren't my fault yet he'd scream at me and hit me and take it out on me as if it was. He'd push my face into cat shit and spit on me and laugh. Hes a lazy motherfucker too, all he does is smoke cigars, go on the computer and sleep. It'd be a blessing when he was sleeping though because then we wouldn't have to deal with him.  We'd never have necessary supplies for school and we went to school grimy a lot of the time because of several problems. (No gas, no water, broken washer and dryer). Throughout this time, Child Services were called. Our dad, however, had a mental hold on us and he made us fear social workers. He said our family would be ripped apart if we told the truth. And honestly, at that time, I believed it. So when we were questioned, we'd deny all accusations. And we'd make the house somewhat decent (filth, but still cluttered), so Child Services would leave and we'd go back to before.

TL;DR - My dad begins abusing me and because of my dad's manipulation, Children Services don't continue investigation
-- - - - - -
We had visitation with my mom for several weeks, but one time her boyfriend held my sister up on a balcony. NOT OVER, NOT MICHAEL JACKSON-ESQUE AT ALL. Just put her up in the air, she wasn't in danger, but she screamed. My mom made sure it never happened again and my sister never was afraid of him. My dad eventually found this out and prevented us from going over there. When my mom would come pick us up, he would tell us to hide in the house/tell her to fuck off/even make US tell her to fuck off. And we would listen because he painted my mom as such an evil character. (""She left you guys, never wanted to take care of you"" ""The only reason she wants you guys is for your child support check"" ""She never does anything for you or tries to call (when she did, he would blatantly monitor the phone calls -- even though nothing bad was being sad, its invasion of privacy!)"") So we would eventually learn to detest our own mother, just because of the persuading stories our dad told us. So you think, why didnt she go to court over this? Partly because she was depressed that her own kids hated her, partly because when she went to the police they wouldnt do anything and say it was domestic, and partly because she was broke. She had to quit her job because her condition got so worse she couldnt even walk (which my dad flips into ""she quit so she didnt need to pay child support"").

TL;DR - Visitation stops for stupid reason and my dad makes us despise our own mother (which we would find out later, for no good reason).
-- - - - - -
My dad's abuse toward me varied in many ways. I'm an honors student, got awards and scholarships. No praise whatsoever, unless cleaning all the cat shit in the house while getting screamed at counts. There was never a break with him. He'd barge into my room in the middle of night to scream at me and keep me up. When I was sick, he'd say I was faking it and just continue to make me scrub the sludge of cat and dog feces and unmaintained bathrooms while he would just laugh at me and call me a 'stupid cunt'. He'd bring up fights from weeks, months, years ago and bitch about them like he still has resentment. I'm sorry but after a point, you just don't want to hear it anymore. He'd hold me accountable for everything that was wrong in the house (even though 99% of it wasn't my fault). When he talked and thought I wasn't interested (which I probably wasn't), he would corner me into a wall and beat me.
He abused my brother the worst physically. He's the youngest and the only boy. My dad never really bonded with him like father-son time. Bill used to have tantrums and would get frustrated that we weren't a normal family. He got fed up with cleaning and sometimes trashed his room because ""it already is anyway"". My dad would drag him across wooden floors , make him take off his shirt and beat him with belts. He would slap, punch, kick, him in front of us. Call him a dickhead, a dumbass. Mind you, at this time, we're fucking innocent children who got good grades, and we were well-mannered. We were forced to be  living with the problems my dad caused us. We were all anxious all the time and it was just a bad, bad environment.
As for my sister, she's the middle-child. My dad never really did much to her or made her really do anything. She was verbally put down with derogatory terms and wasn't praised either. She got screamed at and smacked, but never beat.

TL;DR - My dad was mentally, emotionally and physically abusive to me. Physically abusive to my brother and mentally abusive to my sister.
-- - - - - -
Though all this was going on, we dealt with it. We had this vision of ""everythings going to get better"". Because no matter what, we all loved our dad and we didn't know the truth. All we knew was him and he was the person we ""counted"" on.  I started highschool and made new friends. School became my outlet. I loved being there because it would get me out of the house. Perfect attendance freshman year. It began getting worse when my dad thought ""I was hanging out with the wrong crowd"". Honestly, I really wasn't. My friends liked to have sleepovers and personally, I thought I was old enough to not have to call him every hour and let him talk to my friend's mother to let him know I was being honest where I was at. It wasn't fair, I had restrictions for no reason. I followed with his demands for awhile but then I started getting in trouble for completely nothing. I would call him to check in on him and he wouldnt answer. Later when Id come home he'd start screaming at me saying ""IF I DIDNT ANSWER WHY WOULDNT YOU LEAVE IMMEDIATELY, YOURE DOING DRUGS YOURE OUT ALL NIGHT ETC ETC"" cliche teenager stuff, but cliche teenager stuff I WASNT DOING.

TL;DR - We all just hope for the best/Oblivious to our dad's craziness

Cue to sophomore summer, I was 16 at the time. I got a boyfriend and my dad freaked out. He said I couldnt see him, that he recognized him smoking weed this one time (??? apparently behind an abandoned building when I was 8  ???). Just ridiculous reasons. He never met Tommy, never met his parents even though they all wanted to. He just says no and says ""I know what kind of people they are"". I know he thinks theyre ""THE COOL PARENTS DO DRUGS DGAF BLAH BLAH BLAH"" but theyre really not. Theyre an average family and he has NO reason. So yes, being a teenager I snuck out. I snuck out at night to see him because during the day my dad would be bitching and I needed an outlet, someone who could deal with me and my problems. I snuck out a lot and eventually my dad caught on. That was a battle. He threw furniture at me. I wanted to go to school, he threw a heavy cabinet in front of the door so I couldnt escape. I tried screaming out the window for someone to help and he started whipping water bottles at me. Fed up, I finally fought back and whipped one NEAR him not even AT HIM. Just because when he sees us flinch, he laughs hysterically and calls us pussies. So I threw it and he's fuming, picks it up and swings it. It strikes me in the back of the head dead-on and I feel dizzy. I forget how the rest of that day went but I eventually got out, had to walk to school and had mini blackouts throughout the day. I had a migraine all day and I told my best friend at the time that I should go to a hospital. I say no (because Im still in that ""defend my dad"" mindset) and go home. My heads pounding and hes screaming at me more. I begin to get fed up. Weeks go by, more fights, I run away to friends house/moms house a couple of times, but in the end I always go back.
He establishes this thing with me that instead of running away. That when things get heated, to go across the street to his friends house (our one neighbor) and let some steam out. I agree.

TL;DR - Fights, running away
-- - - - - -
Finally, junior years coming up soon. I'm still dealing with the same old shit with my dad and the house etc. He's still bitching about the bills, the house, and now about how I run away and how it makes him look bad and how i'm going to be the downfall that will tear our family apart. I got really sick from a UTI. So I took my medicine and stayed in bed for like a week. The house gets even worse because Im not cleaning it. However, schools approaching so I need to get uniforms and my dad knew I had plans to get them that day. I ask him to let me go and just pick them up and then come home. ""NO YOUVE BEEN PLAYING LAZY ALL THIS WEEK, THE HOUSE IS SHIT, YOU JUST WANT TO GO GET HIGH WITH YOUR FRIENDS"" (???) I argue but theres no point. As I'm sitting there, he up and punches me in the face. I've had it. I get up and go out the door and across the street to the neighbors (because thats what he said to do right?) I begin telling the wife what happened and then my dad BUSTS right into their house. The wife tells me GO UPSTAIRS! LOCK THE DOOR! and my dads already charging up the steps and the rest of their family to restrain him. He calms down and they say okay to let him see me. The husband and wife go with him up to see me. He comes over as I'm crying and I say ""just stop hitting m--"" and he whacks me right in the head, in front of them. They immediately get everyone in the house to get him out and call the cops on him. I stay there for the night and the cop says I have to go back (???). So I run up to my room, push this heavy funished chair in front of my door and push my weight against it so he can't get in. I call my mom and friends and say I'm leaving. I start packing important stuff plus some clothes. I hear him creaking up the steps. He starts pounding the door ""LET ME IN"" ""LET ME THE FUCK IN YOU BITCH"" I block the door with more stuff. I hear some tinkering and then I hear him go downstairs. Time passes, and I think he's asleep. I have 6 backpacks packed and I try to open the door. It wont open. He locked it with a latch hook from the outside. I freak out and sob for minutes, then say fuck this. I get a pencil and a ruler and Macgyver the shit of this contraption that lifts the hook up and I'm freed. Mind you, this is middle of summer. I'm sweaty, thirsty and I just felt like a fucking locksmith. I gather my bags and hear creaking. Shit. I redo everything and wait. I hear tinkering again and hear him going downstairs. I check and theres an even harder lock on the door. So I kept my calm and went at it again. Hours go by and I'm finally free. I run into this room with all my bags and hide under the clutter. Eventually my dad wakes up and goes to check on me. He starts screaming and looking for me everywhere. He even came into the room I was in (it felt like a horror scene almost) and then left. He wakes up Alyssa and tells her to search for me. She eventually goes into the room I'm in and I say ""Liss! I have to leave, I'm sorry."" She says that she understands and will tell me when the coast is clear for me to book it out of here. He goes to take a shower and she cues me to leave.  I walk out into my driveway and she throws me my backpacks out the window. I tell her I love  her and walk in the rain to my friends house, before I go to my mom's.

TL;DR - I run away for good
-- - - - - -
I'm at my friend's house and her mother takes me to my mom's house. My mom lives in an apartment building so theres the entrance, lobby, and entrance to elevators which are all separated by glass doors and one that needs a keycard to get in. As we're going in, my dad pulls up in a car and charges at us. We get to the glass door that needs a key and we're stuck. So my friends mom puts herself between me and him to protect me.

[elevators] |glassdoor| me  -friends mom- my dad | &lt;-- so it sorta looks like this

He punches her in the face and then in the stomach and she pees herself. He starts screaming at me that I'm a whore, a cunt, and for me to come home NOW. Standbyers eventually call the cops and he hightails it out of there. We file a police report. Eventually I get a PFA against him, my mom gets a PFA against him, she gets custody of me, and theres two assault charges (that my friends mom won) against him.
-- - - - - -

So I live at my mom's currently. I'm happy now. I found out my mom's half of the story and it all adds up. I remember him whipping phones at her and her having black eyes. I remember her crying for me to call the cops but I was too little and scared. I remember him beating her. He threatened to kill her and shes so disabled, she is defenseless. So no wonder she left. It was either he was gonna kill her or she was gonna kill herself. And I thank god that she's here today. I love her so much and I competely understand what she went through because my dad's making me go through it.
The only thing that makes me sad is how my dad still resents me. I've branched out to him still, because I still love him and I visit him on important occasions like holidays and birthdays but it always ends the same with him screaming at me calling me a whore and my boyfriend a druggie and my mom a bitch, which is all false. So I leave. It makes me upset because my brother and sister have to deal with him. And I realized that he would turn his back on me like how he treats my mom. He brainwashed my brother and sister to feel that way too.
-- - - - - -
---- Below is a little graphic VVV

We tried to start-up visitation again with my brother and sister cause I missed them. We would go to the house and they would deny us or wouldn't answer the door. Well, one day I got fed up and entered the house through a window. The stench hit me and I almost gagged. The house was ten times worse than when I lived there. More cats, shit all over my brothers and sisters clothes. I began taking pictures because I almost died at how worse it got and that I left my own siblings in this shithole. Flies buzzing everywhere, toilet clogged with shit and piss stains everywhere. Soda bottle filled with pee stacked up. All along with animals running amock and maggots falling out of the fridges. I cried. This entire time I had been against calling Child Services on them because I was still in that ""torn family"" mindset. But I couldn't let them live like that. I began looking everywhere, all the rooms were filthy. I opened the upstairs bathroom and twenty kittens scattered past me. Cat litter everywhere. I went to the kitchen again and opened the oven and that's when I fucking lost it. There was a carcass of a dead animal (presumably cat) just laying on the racks. You could see its skeleton sticking out and the fur everywhere. I ran out of the house with all my pictures and called everyone I could. That's when I lost all respect for my dad, and stopped caring about ""the family getting torn apart"" because honestly, them living anywhere would be better than shit.

TL;DR - How bad the house got after I left
-- - - - - -
Animal Abuse, Children Services, Cops, Health Department, they were all there the next day. I'm not sure what happened when they got there but my mother and I were hoping that my brother and sister would be brought to us (seems logical right?), but no, my dad picked who they got to live with while the house got fixed up. He chose this new-found friend to take care of them and my mother and I couldn't find them nor speak to them. We were upset and desperate to find them but the family would ""waggle"" them in front of us and tease us with them and drive off. As if it was a game.


The house eventually gets fixed up and becomes a decent, livable house. They are put back in the house. I'm happy that now they don't have to live in filth and they could actually have their friends over.
We start up visitation with them again and the court grants us it.
We've had them over for visitation (first three weeks of the month) since December. And we've talked to them about our side of the story (how dad paints us as evil characters) and they share what happened since I've not lived there. Apparently (and I expected it), all the labor went on to Alyssa and Bill continued to be beat. We knew this and told them to talk to their counselor or SOMEONE about it. But they're still in that ""don't break up the family"" mindset. It's only getting worse and worse because they talk about how ALL my dad talks about is ""You love me, not your mother. She did nothing for you. When we go to court you need to back me up"". He's making them LIE, and we want them to tell the truth. And unfortunately, we've gone to psychologists, Children Services, the police, everyone. And unless the kids themselves say it, theres nothing they can do. Everyone looks at us like we're crying wolf, when we're telling the truth and the abused children are lying.
-- - - - - -
But my brother has been coming around, he stands up to my dad and says that he doesn't want to be ""brainwashed"" anymore by my father. 
Just this monday, my brother ran away to live with us here at my mom's. He said that my dad was about to beat him with a broom because my brother wanted to take a shower and there was (the cat hoarding starting again) cat shit all in the tub, so he asked if my dad could clean it. He ran out the door to the neighbors and they took him here.

Just today we went to Children Services explaining the situation so it wouldnt be kidnapping. They said that he can't live us because of my mom's boyfriend. Apparently my sister lied about this huge story about how the boyfriend hung her over the balcony. My dad has the most mental control over Alyssa and she definitely made her say that. The took him away from us and hes now living with the family-friend that my dad chose. So cue not seeing my brother for awhile.



-- - - - - -
I'm not sure how well I clarified this, but the reason we kept just being ok with what our dad was doing was because: We didn't want to be known as that broken family. We were afraid of social workers and that our family would be torn apart. We loved him and he manipulated us by saying certain things. (He has high blood pressure and he'd say: ""Why would you stress me out, you'd give me a heart attack), etc.


My dad had good intentions for us, to go to school and become something in life. And its not to say that they're weren't good times we had as a family with him. But something happened and he became a monster. He honestly terrorized our entire family mentally, emotionally, and physically.


Theres tons more to tell, more significant stories, more court cases to discuss, so much more, but I figured this was TL;DR enough :/ Sorry for the shitty grammar, spelling, etc. I was venting.
So, Reddit, I need advice. How can I get through to these people, is there no way to prove that the dad is manipulating them? I just want them to live here with my mom, honestly because its not healthy for them to stay there. He locks them in the house all day, no phone, no internet, no playing with friends. Just him screaming at and hitting them both ALL because hes so paranoid since I left.

If you need any further questions, ask away because I may not have clarified everything.

And honestly, thank you, if you read all that.

I've yet to get my high school degree and my job is too exhausting to pursue anything else.

I dropped out of high school when my father was incarcerated when I was 16. I lived with my mother for a short while but she stole some money I got from a government grant to start a small business. I moved to another city 10 hours away after the incident (there was many issues while I was living with her before that too), after asking for help from family in that area. 

At first they were helpful, they gave me a place to stay and support. After the second week, they had a discussion with me about paying rent on the furnished garage I was staying in. I didn't realize they were asking for an exorbitant amount because I had no frame of reference of what a normal rent was. 

I worked at a temp agency for about a month and a half, barely affording the rent. I would show up some days and wait for 5 hours at the agency along with several other men, and sometimes I wouldn't get any work. I was looking for work for the time I was living there as well. It was difficult because I never had a job before. 

Eventually I couldn't pay the rent one bi-week and they gave me a very long rant about entitlement and how mooching isn't going to get me anywhere. I tried to reason but I started reflecting on how things were and they were pretty messed up. I moved out of their place and moved myself into a homeless shelter. 

After a while there, I moved out into a shared slummy townhouse where I dealt with strange drama most of the time I was home. I attempted going back to high school but it was difficult with no money. I dropped out again after 3 months of putting up with it, and I found a job as a dishwasher. I stayed there for a little over a year working 35 hours a week, always taking extra initiative and trying to work more hours.

One day while working there, a line cook and I had an argument, and the owner told me I wasn't allowed to work the line anymore because it was making the guy upset. I gave my notice that day and started looking for more work. I moved back into the homeless shelter after being unemployed for a while. I found another job after a few months at a fast food restaurant.

During my time working there, my father was released on parole. When he moved where I was, we moved in together. He refuses to take any money for rent and we've always had a good relationship. It's a shame he did something stupid that put him where he was but things got better for him. He got a job soon afterwards and a car, and got an apartment. Only problem, he's living an hour and a half from where I work. I put up with it because I know from experience things could be worse. 

Now I work a strange schedule that has me opening, closing, doing management activities. My hours range from 60-80 hours a week. It's very difficult because after the long commute and work, I don't have time for sleep, or much else. I used to love exercise but it's so difficult when you're working a schedule like this. I'm starting to get a little bit big and it's starting to become a concern for me. I don't want to get overweight and unhealthy.

So basically, I want to be able to finish my school, go to community college, and get myself an actual nice job where I actually can contribute, but I don't know where to start.

What do I do?",4,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dsk7o/depressed_anxious_and_lacking_the_energy_to_deal/,"I have tried to talk to people, but it hasn't helped at all (which is helping to reinforce my non-communicative ways). 

After four years of phases of depression and extreme anxiety, only interrupted by short-lived invincible highs, I decided to actually try and talk about it. I told my mother, who didn't seem to buy it, mentioning things like 'oh, you're periods due soon', and not really listening to what I was trying to tell her. I tried to talk to my best friend, and she gave me the 'sympathy eyes' and a hug, and then started to talk to me about her own problems and how she probably needs help if I think MY problems are bad. 

I can somewhat understand, because I definitely put on a good show. I've made a huge, exhausting effort to seem confident and sure of myself, and appear like everything just rolls off me like water off a duck. Still, though, after the constant badgering to open up, I'd hoped the one time I try to they'd actually take me seriously.

Anyway, to continue. I went to a doctor, he was nice and referred me to a psychologist, but wrote off the depression and mood swings and only mentioned the anxiety as an underlying problem (diagnosing me with an anxiety disorder), saying that I 'seemed fine'. That's cool, he's just a doctor, this isn't his area.

Well, I talked to the psychologist, but I didn't feel like I had the opportunity to explain what I had wanted to explain. She talked a lot about all these things that confused me and continuously gave me 'homework' that she never asked about again. After every appointment I came out feeling worse, and more stressed out than ever.

These days I just feel exhausted, I am stressed out about everything, I can't maintain my relationships with people, I can't commit, and have intimacy issues. I use alcohol as a social crutch to seem normal, even to the point where I actually did shots before I went to see a movie with my friends (whom I had been avoiding). 

The only reason I leave the house these days is because being inside and feeling trapped gives me panic attacks.

I have frequent thoughts about self harm and suicide, I don't think I would, I just think about it.   

Every day just giving up everything entirely seems more and more appealing. Just forgetting everything, study, work, people. I don't care about indulging myself in things, as I don't even find my hobbies pleasurable, I just don't want, and can't handle, any more stress.


TL;DR: Depressed, suffering from an anxiety disorder, not enjoying life, and losing all my friends. Sought help, didn't get any. About ready to give up.

1367464270.0,5,self.Advice,1dj1ck,"20[F], Feeling absolutely directionless, probably going to have to leave my university.",5,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dj1ck/20f_feeling_absolutely_directionless_probably/,"Okay. Here's my sob story, which is really not a sob story at all? I don't know. I'm just going to get into it and see where it goes.

So, I'm twenty years old, and just finished my sophomore year at a private university in southern California. When I applied here during my senior year of high school, my initial goal was to get into the nursing program. However, once I began my freshman year, I learned that my school had changed its acceptance policies for the nursing program, making it nearly impossible to get in unless you had already been accepted. I hadn't, obviously. This was actually alright by me, because the more I looked in to possible careers in the medical field, the more drawn I felt toward becoming a Physician's Assistant, rather than a nurse. 

So, I declared my major as Applied Health with a PA emphasis and began taking classes in pursuance of that degree. Unfortunately, I kept bombing every major science course required. This is obviously a huge problem, considering Applied Health is a science major...Clearly, this is not something I am meant to be doing. Don't misunderstand...the poor grades were not for lack of effort or lack of interest. I spent extra hours studying with groups, by myself, and with a tutor. No success. Plus, focusing so much concentration on my science classes meant that even my general ed classes suffered...and those were no cake walk on their own to begin with. After the second semester of my freshman year, my parents told me I had one more chance to get my grades up or they would stop paying for my schooling. Before we all jump on the ""Well plenty of people go to school without their parents' help!"" bandwagon, understand that with the way FAFSA works, until you are 24, your parents' income is taken into account when determining eligibility for financial aid. So, even if my parents decide not to pay for my schooling, the amount of money they make means that I won't receive any kind of aid. I won't even be able to take out student loans for the full cost of tuition because the responsibility is expected to be on my parents. Stupid system, if you ask me.

Anyhow, so I was told I needed all B's first semester of my sophomore year, or they would stop paying. I didn't get those straight B's...not even close. However, they gave me one last chance to get my grades up, and they let me finish out the year. Well, I just took my last final and I didn't even get a C average. Nope. To say I feel like a failure/total moron is an absolute understatement. I've put so many hours into my school work and I've been stressed so much about doing well and yet I'm still failing at school. 

For the sake of context, this semester has had a million and two distractions. I work two jobs, for a total of ~30 hours a week as a tutor and a cashier at a shit grocery store. Both are commuting jobs...20 miles to be a tutor and 40 to the grocery store. Yes, I've looked for jobs closer to school and I still am, but between working what I am and school, there's not a whole lot of free time for job searching. As I mentioned earlier, I've recently realized that Applied Health is also probably not the major for me. Since becoming involved in my campus' Progressive political club, I've come to a tentative realization that social sciences might be a better fit for me. Right now, my idea is to major in Sociology and minor in Political Science, then go on to get an MSW or Master's of Social Work. I'm going to need more experience to know for certain but this feels like the best direction thus far. Now, I'm just trying to consolidate for the fact that careers in the medical field are abundant and pay well, whereas careers in the social work field are not as such. But they say it's not ALL about money, right? If it makes me happy, it's supposed to be worth it. Right? Anyway. Other distractions have included handling my love life (I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years just before Christmas. Fears of being too young to be that committed, making my parents'/grandparents' mistakes, etc), and home life (mother rented out my room to a coworker. Did it for generous reasons, but leaves me on the couch when I move home in three days). I've actually found an apartment and roommates for summer, for only 325 + utilities/month. 

I guess the point of this mess of rambling is this: **I didn't fulfill my side of a deal I made with my parents: get good grades or we're not paying for your schooling anymore. Put forth my best effort in school, but also had a dozen distractions. Now left wondering where I'm going, what I'm doing, how to take the next steps.**

My options for school:
1. Convince parents to allow me to attend school part-time. Cost per unit is still expensive.
2. Attend the community college near my university.
3. Attend the community college near my home.

My options for housing:
1. Attempt to earn enough money per month to afford rent with two best friends. (Current, original plan).
2. Ask parents to cover cost of rent, since they won't be paying expensive tuition anymore. Rent ~ 500/month
3. Live at home. Would imply attending school near home. Potentially means living on my mom's couch, since she's rented out my room. Renter might leave, might not. Home life is rough and crowded and uncomfortable. My month-long winter break was long enough for me to be ready to get out again, and the feeling was mutual.

My parents are first generation indians, so they are really strict, but I don't really think they like me, they think that depression/social anxiety is just an excuse to be lazy and not go to school.
Anyways, today I was feeling depressed as usual, and my older 28 year old brother got up in my face all day, (like literally) and was verbally abusing me, then I responded and told him to leave me alone, and then he punched me in the stomach super hard, (ofc this isnt the first time he physically abused me).

So then I waited for him to leave after being super frustrated, and in an hour I packed my monitor, my pc, my keyboard, mouse, shoes, 3 pairs of clothes, toothbrush, toothpaste and I called a cab and it drove me to the library, so here I am, I have a small handbag, a suitcase and my schoolbag.

I am good with computers and would like to do something related to computers as a job, but don't know how that would ever happen if I only have a GED.

As the title says, I'm an uneducated 19 year old American and I want to turn my life around, but I don't know what to do.

Due to an incident with a teacher in 1st grade, my parents pulled me out of school and my mom started homeschooling me. It went alright for a year or two but then I started slacking more and more until I pretty much completely stopped doing schoolwork all together. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's all I feel the need of saying. Just a little bit of backstory.

Anyway, pretty much I haven't had standard education since I was maybe 9 or 10 years old(it probably shows in my grammar). I was extremely uneducated until I was around 15 years old and started getting into computers. Pretty much everything I know today that is above a 3rd or 4th grade education I have learned from either observation or by teaching myself.

Thankfully after getting my own computer for Christmas about 4 1/2 years ago, I have learned a ton since then. I got used to interacting through text which drastically improved my ability to spell, which I was *terrible* at before that.

I have since built a passion for computers and which leads to my next problem. The past few years computers have pretty much consumed my life. I rarely even leave my house anymore. To make it even worse I have a bad case of IBS which makes leaving the house a very unpleasing thing. Recently I got put on anti-anxiety medication to help with IBS attacks and it seems to be helping a lot, but due to some side effects of the medication that don't seem to be going away I may have to stop taking them and then that puts me back to square one.

I plan on going for my GED soon since I think that should be my first step, but what do I do afterwards? My family is in a very bad financial situation so college is pretty much out of the question. I doubt I'll be able to get a job good enough to support myself with only having a GED. I don't want to live a life of constant struggle and I feel that a GED wouldn't allow for anything other than that.

Here's the opening paragraph, though. 

""----, your plan to ruin me I feel has failed. And what I mean by that is your plan to not only take my designs whether they be based off yours or not but to put your little mark on everything you can that pertains to me or an idea I developed because of the lack of knowledge you have.""
 
This goes on for nearly 20 paragraphs (he made 16 separate posts) and eventually turns into some kind of psychotic babbling about moral fiber and quoting some writer, and ends with:

""Truth is ----, you were a good friend of mine for a while. That still holds true to this day but any day after, I don’t believe so.""



Thing is, I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about. About a week ago he invited me over to his place to smoke pot and had me look at the website he was developing and asked me for input on it, which I gave him. He later accuses me of recording our entire visit (I can't fucking make this up). 

The worst part is he decided to do all this on a public wall post, and because I don't check my facebook often, it stayed up there for about a day or two. A lot of my friends saw it and commented asking what the hell was wrong with him. Very embarrassing for me. On top of that, he's even called several mutual friends of ours and demanded that they ""stop hanging out with me"".

How the hell do I handle this?

I have been doing ok, but not great (about a 2.8 gpa). So far my parents have invested $20,000 in my schooling here. I will have to go for 5 more semesters and it will cost them another $20,000 and myself $10,700 because I don't want to ask them to pay for the 9th semester, and scholarships run out after the 8th semester.

I have been having doubts about if this is what I really want to do. I do enjoy learning, math, and technology, but I also like working with my hands. I haven't really gotten into the core computer engineering classes yet, but it seems like most days would be spent working on code or circuits from behind a desk. Although not a terrible job option, I am beginning to think I don't want most of my work days to be behind a computer screen at a desk. 

I just recently started to look at different job options, and an electrician seems to be a great option for me. There is an educational/mathematical side to it, and also a practical ""get your hands dirty and do work"" side of it. It seems most days would be spent out in the field actually doing things instead of designing things from a computer. Also, with an apprenticeship I gain money instead of losing it. I don't know if I would want to be a lineman, residential, or industrial electrician though. I also had over a 4.0 high school gpa which is what they ask for when applying. The reason my college gpa is so low is because I struggled with upper level calculus/physics and got a few Cs in those classes.

I have $11,000 saved from detasseling in summers and a $3,000 motorcycle. I'm beginning to think I should buy a small house/rent an apartment, get a car, and get an apprenticeship as an electrician. It's scary though, and I don't know if it is the best option.

She's always had a BUCKET load of confidence where as I, not so much. She's always been a talker, and I've been a listener. So all through school we just worked. She'd talk on, I'd listen. 

But, since I went to college, got a job and a boyfriend obviously my confidence has grown a lot since school and I've become more open with how much I talk. And, given the chance I will talk and talk and TALK. My parents actually have to tell me to shut up at times; where as my boyfriend will just let me go into minute long rambles about absolute bullcrap, which I could never thank him enough for because it gets it out of my system. But this isn't about them.

My best friend. She's selfish. When she's talking about herself, it'll be all eye contact, making sure I'm listening and all about her... But once she's finished and I take my chance to talk about my experience (maybe with the same subject shes talking about), her eyes travel down to her phone and she'll start texting or even just playing GAMES and I think it's super rude. And I wouldn't mind if it was just every now and then but it's all the time. 

Other stuff she'll do is like today, she actually got up and left the room while ""clearing away breakfast"" while I was trying to explain to her how I'm thinking of moving in with my boyfriend (after she'd just finished complaining her boyfriend was pressuring her to move in with him because she's not ready. I will mention here she absolutely HATES my boyfriend, and he hates her.) I understand maybe she doesn't want to talk about my  boyfriend, so I try not to bring him up to much. But I thought it was relevant to the conversation (I'm right in thinking a 'conversation' is two people...conversing and not just a one sided thing, right? :S) but it's not even just on the subject with my boyfriend...

I could be talking about ANYTHING and she'll either but in while I'm mid-sentence and turn the subject back onto her, look down at her phone and text/play games, walk out OR let me ramble and just give me one word answers until I can't possibly carry on the conversation and I can tell she's not paying attention at all.

And then, when she finds out I've done something and moans that ""I never tell her anything."" we have the argument that, yes, I do tell her stuff but she never listens. And she argues back that she does listen, but maybe she just forgot. 

It's just really starting to wind me up, maybe I'm being the selfish one here? I don't know. 

It just seems like as long as we're talking about HER or her life, all is good. But as soon as I want to talk about something, it's uninteresting. 

The other month, me, a friend and her all stayed over her house. We were playing monopoly because our friend had never played it before. And it ended in my best friend playing apps on her phone, so we had to wait FOREVER for her to take her turn because she hadn't realised it had gone round again, and we were trying to have a conversation with her but again, she was too busy not listening and being on her phone. If she was that bored with the game she could've just said she didn't want to play.


**TL;DR:** best friends never listens to me unless we're talking about her. I have told her in the past (and all the damn time) that she never listens but she just basically laughs at me and tells me she does, but maybe she just forgets.

1367014611.0,4,self.Advice,1d6kxz,Got caught by conservative parents with alcohol and condoms in my bag and now I feel like a stranger in my own house.,5,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1d6kxz/got_caught_by_conservative_parents_with_alcohol/,"Alright Reddit, I’ve never come to you for advice but I may now need it as I honestly am lost to find a solution to what is going on with my family. I grew up in an Islamic household where ideas were tolerated but some fundamental lines were never allowed to be crossed. I love my parents and have been in trouble with them more times than I remember, though there are only a couple occasions where I have felt that I actually have wronged them. Examples include stealing money from my parents, and stealing their car prior to having my drivers license. I’ve accepted my wrongdoing in such occasions and have learned from my mistakes. Then there are occasions where disruptions and awkward tendencies have presented themselves within my family when I get caught for doing something that the average person would deem as normal. Out of respect for my parents, I sit and listen to their lecture but do not believe to have done anything wrong. When my father found pornography on my computer, I wasn’t given the man to man talk most fathers would give their sons, but a scolding and how dangerous masturbation can be (sounds off I know) and being restricted from computer access in my house. After I was caught with a bottle of alcohol hidden in my clothing, I was treated as though I committed a crime ( was of legal age 18 ). My mother also walked in on me with my girlfriend at the time in my bedroom and instead of sugarcoating it with lies I told her that we had sex. She cried hysterically and told me I was a pervert. I was made to feel as though I had raped someone. She now feels uncomfortable with me around my little cousins and never leaves me alone with them and gives me dirty looks and lectures when I tell her I was out with a girl. Staying out late with friends rewards me with an awkwardly quiet household with an interrogation process which is forcing me to lie more and more about my whereabouts. 

Now I should mention that I am 23 years old, living with my parents, and am in the middle of a bachelors degree at a well-respected University. In addition I have done a few years away from my family serving in the military which bothers me as to why they are still so muzzling of my behaviour. I have no religious affiliation whatsoever and my parents never force me to pray, though they still impose religious values on me. My mother already knows I am not Muslim although I feel as though it would hurt my father if he found out.

 Yesterday morning I woke up and noticed my mother not speaking to me. I did my usual morning routine and notice a box of condoms and a small bottle of alcohol I had in my bag lying on her dresser. I was heading to an exam so I didn’t have time to speak to her and I just left the house. Upon returning, my mother wasn’t home so I went straight to sleep for pulling the all-nighter from the night before. My mother didn’t return that night or the night after. My dad hasn’t been saying hello to me when he returns from work and has been ignoring me since. 

My parents grew up in the Middle East though I was born and raised in Canada. I have never had a sense of belonging to religion, culture and traditions. My parents are very understanding and aren’t very religious themselves. I want to come clean and tell them that that these things are not going to stop and they are just making me lie more and more about things that guys normally go through here. I enjoy the university life everyone else does and indulge in things that seem appropriate to everyone but my parents. My older sister had indulged in certain activities when she was unmarried and still lived with us though it was me always getting caught. 

I just want to hear some of your thoughts, experiences and advice on the matter. Being 23 I need to be able to make my own decisions without upsetting my parents or constantly having a quiet household because their imaginations get the best of them. Sounds like a teen thing to say but I need independence and freedom to make choices on my own without fear of a backlash from my parents. If anyone in my surroundings spoke of me they would have nothing bad to say. I am a good person although I cannot be constrained to a system that I do not believe in.

How can I handle this?,4,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1d5qlh/my_fiance_has_suddenly_developed_a_drinking/,"Last night my fiance and I had the worst row we've had in all our 7 years together.  I'm facing a lot of health and financial challenges right now, and when I came to my fiance for support he shut me out, and then became extremely hurtful.  Even cruel.  He had been drinking.  

There have been times here and there over the decade I've known him, when I worried about his use of alcohol.  In times of stress he tends to abuse it, or use it to induce sleep.  But recently his drinking has escalated, and he's switched from beer to vodka.  According to him, it's because vodka is less fattening.  But when he drinks, he becomes uncaring, and says extremely hurtful things that he can't take back.  It's like he becomes a completely different person.  

Since this seems to have come on quite suddenly, I was unprepared to deal with my finance's burgeoning alcoholism.  This is not the person I've known all these years.  This is coming at a time when I really need the help and support of my partner, and I feel like I've lost him.  He's the most awesome guy in the world... When he's sober!

I just feel really lost and confused.  God is giving me the strength to face my own challenges in life, I don't have what it takes to deal with an alcoholic right now.  I've had friends and family (cousins) with addiction, and I've been through the whole rigmaroll with them.  I know how powerless I am.  Things were bad last night, but I wonder how bad things will have to get before my fiance acknowledges he has a problem and decides to start working on it.  That scares me.  I can't and won't go through a downward spiral with him.  It is taking all I've got just working on myself.  I almost threw him out last night.  But I didn't. I want to throw the alcoholic part of him out.  I hate that guy.  What the hell can I/ should I do?

Unfortunately I can't get to an alanon meeting at least for a while, due to my location/transportation issues, or I would have been to one already.  I'm hoping you guys can offer me some insight and perspective.  I feel very alone.

Thank you.

They're between two fences and a metal chain fence. Later I saw their mother with them nursing them.

I really feel the kittens would be better off in homes where they will be fed and loved, rather than living in the alley and breeding to no end. But that's where the problem starts.

My parents can't stand animals. They think they're dirty and smelly and wreck the furniture. So any chances of me trapping the mother and bringing the kittens inside to nurse them myself would be hard. None of my neighbors would take the kittens in. We use to have a ton of cats in the neighborhood but after a huge uprising of them followed by a giant catching of them by animal control, all of my neighbors see the cats as poop machines they make their garden smelly and they don't want to take care of the cats either.

What should I do? I'm pretty set on trapping the mother and bringing the kittens inside and leaving them in my room so my parents won't complain about them. But how would I get the mother trapped and, best case scenario, have the mother fixed then release her back? Renting a humane trap is $10 a day and adding the cost of a trap to all the costs of rasieing the litter of four kittens would be far too much for me to handle. (I'm 21 years old going to college and I don't have a job yet) 

All the no-kill shelters in my area got horrible write-ups for being dirty and messy and having sick animals in all the cages piled on top of each other. Any other shelter would euthanize the mother almost instantly because she is feral and would be hard to socialize.

The kittens are about 3-4 weeks old so I know they should be with their mother but after I discovered the next of kittens, their mother hasn't left to find food for herself or water and that's not healthy for her either. I don't look at them anymore because I'm afraid she'll move the kittens and then none of them will get help. My bf got his cat from the mother when the kitten was only 2 weeks old and he (the kitten) grew up fine with his sister from the litter. I'm well aware that I'll need to bottle feed the kittens with kitten formula, help them defecate, etc. The main thing is, how to go about getting the mother away from them and then getting my parents to accept the kittens in my room. 

Here are pictures of the kittens I took when I first found them. (I put the camera lens through the metal fence) http://imgur.com/a/gHEr3#0

***

TL;DR 

* There is a litter of kittens with a feral mother who is not leaving the kittens to find food for herself 

* No one in my neighborhood will take the kittens in 

* I have parents who will find it hard to accept the kittens inside the house 

* I also don't know how to lure the mother away in order to get to the kittens

I know the first response is always, ""Do some research, follow your heart, go to grad school, or figure it out yourself because I don't know you,"" and trust me, I have kept all of these in mind. People keep saying, ""Don't worry about it, you'll figure it out, it'll come to you, blah blah blah,"" but I feel like I am wasting my time and money in college right now because I have no idea even a direction to pursue. 

Background:
I am in my first semester as a sophomore at a university, and my major right now is marketing and supply-chain management only because it starts out at $50,000 and I have an opportunity to work my way up and maybe travel. I am not particularly interested in business, and don’t think of myself as the kind of person that would thrive in the business world.

Interests:
I have never been really interested in one thing, but rather a little interested in a lot of things. I’ll often find an interest in one thing and spend a little time learning about it, and then move on to the next thing. I think that is my biggest problem. I do not have significant ups and downs when considering my abilities or interests. I think I have interests in the same things a lot of people do but don’t get them well/decent-paid jobs, like English, psychology, sociology, etc. I am fascinated by people and how they work and why they do the things that they do, but jobs in these fields are scarce, and I do not have enough outstanding qualities to land me jobs in these competitive fields. As far as my personal life, I have always been sort of a social chameleon. I am rather introverted, but work in a business setting now and work fine with people. I work really well in small groups and feel the most comfortable in one-on-one settings. I have had a best friend since kindergarten (the loud/social butterfly type) and we get along great. Besides her, I have floated around and gotten along with everyone just fine. Between school and work, I haven’t acquired any additional skills (but suggestions for useful skills would be great).

 I was always average at math, and sometimes struggled just to make a C. I wish I liked science so badly, but it is just so hard for me to spark an interest in the fundamentals. I took a biology class for non-science majors last semester with a wonderful professor and make a C. I'm sure you can't tell from this post but I always made good grades in english and enjoy reading. Right now, I work at a small business where I started out in high school as an administrative assistant and now have moved up to nutritional counseling. I expect to have my certification within the next couple of weeks. I enjoy working with people one-on-one and helping clients solve problems, and I love that my job allows me see a significant change in people's attitudes and quality of life. 

Another problem I have is trying to decide what kind of personality type I am. The person I am in my social circle of friends, my family, school, and work are all very different. I am the oldest child, so I am kind of used to being the boss and making the decisions. I get along with my younger sisters very well though. At home, I'm loud, sarcastic, enthusiastic, one. I have lots of energy and like to be on the go. At work I’m the sweet, enthusiastic, compassionate, young girl. In social settings I’m pretty laid-back. Blend in just fine. 

I have considered several jobs but none seem very realistic. If I though it would work out, I think it would be awesome to fly planes but people always blow this one off or give me the impression it won’t happen because I’m a young girl, not particularly interested in armed forces, aviation school is expensive, and job market is unpredictable.

Archaeology would be cool because of the traveling and all the amazing things you would get to see, but I’d have to have a masters degree and maybe get paid $50,000. 

Another field I have been looking at recently is International relations/diplomacy/homeland security or something along those lines. Dad is very involved in law enforcement so I was raised with an awareness of the law/guns/criminals and so on.

I am willing to move in order to have better chances of finding a job after college. I really need to leave Louisiana at least for a few years as soon as I can. I don’t want to stay in this hick town for my entire life.

I apologize about this being so long. I got carried away but it’s good to get it all down. I know I need to adjust my expectations. I can’t realistically expect to easily get a job in a growing field, make good money, make a difference, love my job, have great benefits, get to travel, and so on. Finishing college is very important and taking time is not an option because TOPS pays a large amount of my tuition and doesn’t allow us to take time off. I am in a career planning class now so hopefully by finals next month I will have figured it out. If I am interesting in something, I can put all of my heart and soul into it. I would be willing to get a masters/double major/additional training/education. Any thoughts, advice, suggestions would be great. For now, I’ll continue to take courses that I’m interested in as well as ones for my marketing degree. If not, this is a great way to vent.

When I first took on the job (which is financial in nature and requires the handling of large sums of money) I came in to replace a long term employee who had been caught embezzling thousands red-handed. My accounts were in complete disarray - there was no training and no help. Just here it is - now get to it.

I have been a loyal, hard-working employee. In the years I have worked here I have turned the accounts receivable around completely. I am professional, courteous, and easy going and I get a long with all of my coworkers.

I work in an office that houses two small business in the medical field. One of the doctor's in the practice employs his wife as a part time office manager. She is not directly my boss as she is employed by the other (completely) separate practice but she does check my books at the end of the day.

Last year I went through a period where I was suffering from insomnia. My doctor prescribed me some meds to help with sleep and the side effects, we discovered, a bit too late were making my normal sharp memory fuzzy. I found I was making little mistakes that were adding up. I was immediately called into my bosses office to convo and I immediately took steps to correct the problem, since I have returned to my normal, stellar performance. Not to toot my own horn, but I am highly overqualified for my position, but when I returned to Pensacola after my divorce it was the best job I could find. 

Somehow, despite my best efforts, tiny little errors kept popping up on my financial reports. Sometimes they were great big errors! I would have to do my best detective work to find out what happened....it always led back to the same place...the office manager. Each time she ""discovered"" an error she would run to the doctor of my practice with it, rather than me and he would demand an explanation...so when I got to the bottom of each dilemma I would present him with my findings. It's a very politically charged atmosphere so I am unable to say ""look! She is making these errors, not me!"" I was a bit more diplomatic about it. He can read between the lines and after a few times he told me to simply tell him it had been rectified - he didn't want to know what was going on.

I goes on constantly. I seem to be the only target in the office and as far as I can see, beyond leaving my job (which I very much need) I don't have any recourse. I have no power in this situation, but I am being bullied and intimidated and I have this overwhelming feeling of panic that hits me in the morning when I head into work and Sunday evenings I can barely raise a smile.

I have been having a serious amount of trouble recently with my mental health. I have significant mood swings. Sometimes I wake up and I know that I am going to get fit, that I am going to go to more classes, and that I will keep writing until I finish my current project. The world is at my fingertips.

Then I slip into a low that makes me feel less depressed than apathetic. I have no ambitions. I don't want to go outside, see my friends. My school-work piles up and I begin to drown. This is when I start to feel suicidal and my fourth floor window begins to look all the more inviting.

The main issue is that I have no reason to feel this way. I have no serious trauma to deal with, I have an alright relationship with my family. I have a girlfriend who I love, and who I think really loves me. Regardless of all this, though, I still manage to get into these pools of doubt and hopelessness. 

I have seen a counsellor at university, but am thinking that I should see someone with a bit more authority on the whole matter. I am scared that this could affect my situation as a student and have me sent home to Australia, I am living in the UK currently.

Honestly, I don't know what I am asking for right now. Any kind of advice could be helpful.

I live in a dorm 12 hours away from home. I have no friends. After two weeks into the first semester I stopped going to my classes, to the point that I barely left my room. I dropped my entire course load at the end of term, and went home for the holidays. I did not tell my parents about the failure of my first semester. Second semester started, and I vowed to make things right. I signed up for the same classes and started off really well... But then the depression and anxiety hit me and the same reclusive behaviour started. I'm doomed. 

I do not intend to ever tell my parents. I am not taking advantage of their savings, I simply could not bear their disappointment. My parents are rather strict and it would absolutely destroy their view of me. They'd probably shame me in front of my entire extended family. 

If I could, I would like to get professional help from the counselling services here. Problem is, I'm too scared to give them a call. It may be stupid of me to think that they would in any way refund or allow me to fix my standing, anyway.

This is a very long text regarding my life problems. I should warn you that this can get depressing.
If you'd like to read and give me advice on what course of action I should take, I'd greatly appreciate it.
Or you can just read. :)
(I am not willing to go to a counselor, by the way.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
So, I need advice in.. well.. life in general.

I'll start by providing some background information on myself involving my character: 
I'm a 17 year old male student, currently a junior in high school. 
I'm introvert unless around friends.
I'm skinny.
I reside in a small city in Texas.
My family is very broken, and not wealthy by any means. 
I live with my father, who isn't my favorite person, and I'm not his.
My mother lives in another city. She's sweet, but she can be extremely annoying.
And, lastly I have a sister. She's considered a horrible role model in my eyes. I try my best to not be around her.


With all that basic, yet embarrassing information about me out of the way, I can continue on to what I specifically need advice on.


For the most part, my life at the moment consists of playing Runescape 2007, going to school, occasionally hanging out with friends, and having two to three conversations with my dad at home.
My life is definitely not where I want it to be at all, and it leads to my hyperactive brain thinking about my future all the time and it's frightening!


My life seems boring, and trust me, it is. But, I have problems that I deal with (this is where the advice comes in).


Firstly, I don't consider myself depressed, but I definitely don't wake up everyday with a smile on my face and it's due to my overwhelming list of shit on my plate that I never get around to doing, because I'm horribly unmotivated.

* I'm unhappy to say the least. My family is in ruin. 
Growing up, my mother was my favorite person (mommas boy), but she fell into the darkness of the drug life, and pretty much leaving my father with an unforgivable hatred towards her for basically ruining what our family had going. 
Despite now, my childhood was spectacular. I was a cute, spoiled little kid. I always got what I wanted due to my mother's love for me. I can remember hating the world when she went away from home for long periods at a time.
I was young, and didn't understand that she was doing meth with her drug friends instead of maintaining a happy life for my sister and I. That was hard for me.. 
When I was a child, I had everything I needed: Loving parents, a sister to keep me company, a sweet, lovely Japanese grandmother to give me attention, a cozy, humble home, and plenty of candy. (I adored candy when I was little)
But now, It's all gradually been stripped away from me, because of lies, mistakes, misfortune, and choices.
I now have two separated parents, a sister in jail, a deceased grandmother, and a blank walled, dreary house that's often dark because of electric bills, and no candy, and very little food in general. (I live in the same house by the way, and it doesn't feel like the home it used to)
My home and family life is a notch above nothing at all to say the least. I don't resent my mother for the choices she has made.


* Next up on this pity problem list is my insecurity. I have this slight belief that girls think I'm attractive, but I have noticeable appearance flaws that hold me back from being my best self.
I'm noted in school for my skinniness, and I hate it, even though it adds to the ""cute"" aspect of me, I'd much rather weigh more than most of the girls in my school. I always tell myself I'll workout to gain muscle mass, but it never happens, and even if it did, it wouldn't matter because I don't get fed well at all at home, due to my cheap father.
My metabolism is fast, and I can usually get through the day with 2 meals without feeling the need to eat, so I typically get a bowl of cereal, or cook breakfast twice a day, neither of those times being in the morning. My diet is horrible to say the least.
I have this big, crooked nose that is not proportionate to my small face at all, and I hate it so much. I think about my nose every day and wish I had a rich family to afford surgery. I often even wiggle the bridge of my nose in hopes that it will somehow magically be straight.. (ridiculous I know)
Next, I have crooked teeth. They aren't necessarily horrible, but they could definitely use braces, and I would enjoy having them, because I'm kind of a weirdo and have a braces fetish. There's this one tooth of mine that bulges out and looks whiter than the others and makes my teeth look somewhat dirty, and I hate it. (I'm very high-maintenance, I know)
I know I shouldn't care about what my peers think about me, but I really can't. I constantly feel the need to be attractive, and sometimes I do when I'm having a good hair day, or wearing nice clothes.
I get compliments on my hair being nice, so that's a plus! I like to think my hair is my saving grace for my attractiveness. I have very few clothes and hate that my parents don't have the money to afford even a few clothes. I can't remember the last time I went shopping. So that doesn't go well with my reputation regarding wealth, which really gets to me. A good portion of my clothes are from friends, which doesn't add onto my self-esteem regarding wealth..
Man, this is getting depressing writing this. It's pretty much an evaluation of how shitty my life is.. XD


* Now it's time for school... oh boy.. 
I consider myself to be a smart guy so grades aren't a huge issue, but people regard me as stupid, because of my humor. I feel as if they don't know I'm joking and they take me seriously.
Everyone who knows my name makes me out to be this ""mysterious guy who's an asshole because he doesn't talk to anyone"" when in reality I'm just shy. I have friends that understand and try to tell people I'm not like that, and though I'm grateful for that, people will always have their opinions of me.
Damn it! I hate that I care what people think!
I don't know much about this problem, it's kind of vague, but everyone deals with this, and I'm sure I'll find a way to cope with it sometime down the line.
I guess I just have a hard time being myself around the unknown. I know people see me in the hall and judge me for wearing skinny jeans, and probably perceive me as nothing more than a skinny homosexual boy even though I've publicly had relationships with girls, but that's Texas for ya. That gets to the feelings pretty deep sometimes.
That's just my own unique style though, I think I've accepted that much. I just need clothes to complement my style, but I can't buy any because I'm poor!
I just want people to like me so I'll have a more eventful teenage experience other than just occasionally smoking weed with my partying friends.



* Then there's my girl problem. At the beginning of this school year, I met a cute, short Mexican girl. I loved being around her. Her laugh was so.. distinct. I adored it. So I made it an effort to make her laugh her butt off every chance I could.
We were going steady for a while, but she found out some things about me. She found out that I lied A LOT. Some things I'd lie about were for a reason, and others were over stupid things that didn't matter. I don't know why I lie so much, it's an issue with me.(I'm getting better though)
I was a pretty horrible boyfriend to say the least, I'd never pay for any meals and such because I never have a job. I would forget to show up to events with her, because I'd either forget or oversleep. (I sleep a lot)
I regret not treating her better. One day in church, the youth pastor was preaching a sermon over relationships. I knew it was targeted towards me because she would say things like ""Find a person that will lift you up in life"" and ""Don't wait for your boyfriend to come around because they won't"" I ignored it and played FunRun on my phone the whole time, just to give that preacher a subliminal ""fuck you!""
After that we drove back to her house as usual. I was sitting on the couch, and she was sitting on the floor. She initiated a conversation about where we stand. She asked me what I got out of the sermon. To keep a long story short, we decided to take a break.
I didn't talk to her once during that break. I purposely ignored her during class and in the halls. Once the week break was over, she facebook messaged me. (I know, right?)
She talked about how she needs a more ""godly man"". Basically she said I wasn't good enough for her, and she asked if we could still be friends, because she misses me. My pride took the wheel and replied with a ""We can't be friends anymore.""
I told her that she needed to ""respect that I need my space"". That was the end of it. To this day, we haven't exchanged words whatsoever. It's been about 5 weeks now, and I stalk her twitter all of the time in hopes she'll say something about me, but there hasn't been much luck. I wonder if she still thinks about me, and it's torture.
And here I am throwing a tweet here and there about her occasionally every week. I feel pathetic, because I know I was a bad boyfriend, and I still decided to step away from the friendship. I would take her back if she'd take me, but I'm fine without it. It would just destroy me if she found another guy though. I don't know, I'm really picky about this.
Now there's this other girl that I thought I was in love with last year. She's graduated now, and we rarely see each other just out on the town. We consider each other ""best friends"" and although I sort've do, we've become very distant. I can still be myself around her though, and make a dick joke or two to crack her up.
I still would like to be more than friends with her, but she and I give each other mixed signals. I've hinted that I like her a couple of times, but she would always brush it off and say things that she wasn't sure about.
But, she tweeted recently ""If I don't end up marrying (my name) then I'll marry someone just like him for sure.) That just about melted my heart. But, she's into partying with her older friends now, and I don't know if she'd think being around me is worth missing out on a ""fun night"". She's also talked about coming over to see me because it's been a while.
And I'm thinking that when she does, we'll go to my room like usual and we'll lay on the bed. While she's talking about some non-sense I don't care for, I'll go in for an interrupting kiss. Now keep this is mind, we've been extremely friend-zoned for a long year, and this would complicate things, but I'm feeling bold. 
Tell me if I should pursue this or not, and also tell me what I should do about the other girl.




* Next up is the oh so embarrassing masturbation problem. I started masturbating about 4 year ago I'd say. I'm still a virgin and this is the next best thing to sex, obviously. It's gotten really out of hand. Starting from last year to now I typically masturbate about 2-4 times a day.
I'm a horny teen what can I say? Hahaha, continuing on.. I just need some advice on how to stop fapping till the break of dawn. 
Maybe I need to have sex with a girl already? That would be a rare chance though, because I weigh less than most girls. I'm sure they wouldn't want a corpse pounding them down. Who knows?




* This problem is about my religion and smoking habits. I believe that Jesus Christ is my Savior. I acknowledge that he died for me. As years have passed, my life has consisted of being devoted to God, and then being tossed to the way side.
Basically, I'm on and off regularly. Off being longer periods of time than On. Lately, I've been praying every night on my bedside for him to make me a better person, and guide me in the right path.
I want to say I've been shown a glimpse of what He has to offer by the tests He's been giving me. I think He wants me to start by getting off of weed and cigarettes, as it leads to trouble (at least in my life) and a depletion of health.
He has been giving me opportunities to turn down weed offers and cigarette offers. I've denied the weed, but I'll always take a cigarette from someone. I know I need to stop, but it's difficult.
But, this could all be in my head. I know nobody can tell me what I should and shouldn't believe in, but I need advice on both subjects never the less.
I know I can do without weed, but I can safely say that I enjoy being high. It's a wonderful escape, and I have very generous friends that provide it.
I stay cooped up in the house all day, and smoking provides something to do, as well as getting high with friends. Although lately, I haven't smoked much of anything for the past 3 days.
I feel as if I should quit for the better, but I hate being bored at home. Music and Runescape only occupy me so much.



* Then I have my hopes and dreams. I have a difficult time being myself. I love singing, but I'm ashamed of that. I sing around my good friends, but that's it.
I can just picture myself with shaky legs up on a stage. I have very little confidence in myself. I like to think I can sing well, but that just becomes a hobby when I want it to become my life.
I would stay up for hours watching my favorite bands play live shows on Youtube. I wish I could have that life. I watch shows like American Idol and X-factor and feel amazed at the people that give it their all in front of thousands of people.
The judgment would be too overwhelming for me. I was in varsity choir for the first time this school year, but the teacher told me that I needed to be bumped down to regular because I lacked technique.
When he judged my voice for my singing ability he must of thought I had a knack for it or he wouldn't of put me in varsity.

I appreciate if you got this far. It boggles my mind that someone would want to read all this bullshit about me. If you'd like to give me advice on these problems I'm going through, I'd love to read it, and reply with my thoughts.

I know some of these problems seem trivial, but they mean a lot to me. Please don't be disrespectful. I already feel pathetic enough for going on the internet about this, but that's the beauty of it. That I can connect with people I'd never meet without the internet.

Thank you.

I am 27 years old, have spinal muscular atrophy type 3 (basically have 0 strength/mobility), and enjoy working and playing video games (SC2, DOTA2 mostly).

So the situation is this: I am broke. I owe like $3,000 in CCs, and 2k in taxes. Now, before you start judging and shit, allow me to explain my situation a little bit. I work from home (mainly because of my condition, travel/work accommodations are tough) and managed to earn roughly 1.5k a month. I live with my sister who recently lost her job, my two nephews (ages around 13, won't specify) and my mother who suffers from renal failure. Obviously money isn't that great, and I am just running out of options. I work from home as a customer service representative, and hours are very limited with my employer. My sister has been applying for jobs left and right, but to no avail. She lost her job a few months ago as well as her house, due to a couple of medical conditions. 

I try to work as much as possible, however, if I work too much, I lose Medi-Cal which pays for my caregiver. If that happened, I would need to earn an extra $500 to cover a co-payment just for him (this wouldn't include any other medical expenses I would have). If it was possible, I'd be working two jobs, but clearly I can't. I work as an independent contractor, and therefore I have to pay a shit-ton for taxes. I wish I could go back to school, but I clearly don't have the money for it, or the time for that matter. It's a shame, because I was only about 15 units away from receiving my AA to transfer to a University, but oh well.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm basically stuck in either trying to panhandle or into doing something illegal. As shameful as panhandling may be, desperate times call for desperate measures. I'm fortunate enough to live in a warm place, because if it gets under 60°... I'm essentially quadriplegic. So that's my current plan: to beg for money. I've read some people have had success with panhandling, and I don't mind doing it, I'm just afraid of getting mugged or something.

I'm not trying to receive any pity, nor help. I am merely asking for some advice. Surely, I'm not the only one that's ever been in this type of situation.

Last July, I got a job at a rest shop off of the highway by my house. No big deal, there were a lot of people with whom I've graduated, so I got acclimated easily and picked up the job quickly.  
Summers are really busy for rest stops, but I enjoyed being busy, so I got used to making several sandwiches a minute (Quiznos) and dealing with rushed customers.  
Now, since I'm in school, I only drive home once a month to retain my job there for the summer. However, any time I go back, I get treated progressively worse by my coworkers.  
Last weekend, I went back to fulfill my monthly requirement, and within 30 minutes of starting my shift, one of the leads (lower than a manager, higher than a regular employee) of Quiznos made me cry. She treated me with such blatant disrespect and gave me such a hard time that I had to excuse myself from the concept (what we call each part of the stop) and take a walk outside.  
This girl has never liked me and intimidates the hell out of me.  
So, naturally, I had to talk to my manager when I got back. I explained to her that I thought the girl didn't like me, never has and never will, and her attitude and scorn was too much for me today. I also told my manager that the girl intimidates me.  
She suggested that maybe I intimidate the girl because I was actually in college and another female.  
My manager said I was a good worker, and that my performance does not warrant such awful treatment.
  
This is one of the many incidents, including another girl muttering comments about me under her breath.  
  
Is my manager right, or am I just on this girl's ""shit list"" like some other people are?  
  
The drama is too much for me to write, for instance, there is another boy that everyone picks on incessantly. His voice, weight, height, attitude, everything is under scorn.  
It's a toxic environment, and I want out before I end up like these people.  
I don't mind the work, the pay is *okay* I guess ($8 an hour), but the people there are ruining it for me.  
But, since this is my first job, I don't know if I should quit, how to quit, or anything.  
**tl;dr The people at my job are drama filled and I feel out of place. I don't know how to quit my job, and I'm unsure of how to go about it in a professional manner. What do I do?**

I now socialize even less. I go out with my boyfriend with other couples but they are HIS friends and the girls aren't my type but I go and have fun. I'm really popular because I can socialize and be outgoing but once I get home I'm spent and my energy is depleted. I tend to have girls flock to me and want to be my friend but I never want it outside of however we met, such as work. I'll get invited to so many things and just constantly decline until the invites stop coming. I still have no clue why even the coolest chicks can't keep my attention and I stay friendless. It sucks because it is very confusing for them since I am SO outgoing, bubbly, happy (I'm happy a lot) and every job I have I'm a favorite among women (it sounds bad when I write it, but it's true). Literally on a daily basis every coworker I walk by (I work in a very large clinic) people greet me with compliments or will come by my area multiple times a day for no reason other than to talk to me (or bug me, as I see it). Being a happy person is just how I am and people tend to want to be around happy people. Yet... outside of work, I just want to be left alone! I have one best friend of 20 years who I can go weeks and weeks without speaking to. I have no idea why this is but I have very little interest in people. I feel relationships are a chore. I do have a VERY successful relationship and I think that may have a little to do with the lack of energy to go elsewhere. Oh, I forgot to add this includes family. I have no interest in them or my boyfriend's family. I just don't find a lot of people interesting.

On to my question... why am I like this? Sometimes I think it relates to my childhood. I had a drunk father and depressed mother who constantly had parties (every weekend either at our house or multiple other homes). I was always around drunk people and other children I did not want to be around. I grew up with a few of them and although they're on my FB, I have no interest in them now. I hated the fact that I was forced to do so much and be around so many shitty people that now I won't be around anyone if I don't want to. I think it's immature when I see it written, but I just won't do it. I barely talk to my family because I refuse to deal with drama or angry people and that's all they are. It's a joke. I feel one day I may wake up and feel lonely for the lack of relationships but here I am completely okay with it. I also do not want children. It may seem weird and you might ask, are you really happy? Um yes! I love being alone. I smoke weed on a daily basis. I call myself a functional stoner (can run errands and be around people high). But yeah I wake up grateful for life every day, I appreciate everything that comes my way, I love nature and being outdoors as much as possible, I just enjoy my life. I have so many things to be happy about yet... I don't want to share it with anyone other than my boyfriend. 

I may delete this because it's rambled on and do I really have a question? Should I post this to /r/offmychest? I guess if someone else is like this, can you tell me how you feel? Are you okay with it or do you wish you were different? Thanks for reading.

The concept for the app is there, it just needs to be thoroughly worked out and refined.

I figure I'll need to work as a communicator at this stage as well. 
Once it's on the market, I get a percentage of the profit.

So how much do I ask for this? 10 %? 20? 30? How does one justify asking a certain number in this case?

1364351764.0,4,self.Advice,1b34h5,breaking out of a rut... tips from those who have had exceptional results,4,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1b34h5/breaking_out_of_a_rut_tips_from_those_who_have/,"I realize the value that an unbiased opinion can have.  Here's my situation:

Five years ago I graduated with a useless degree.  Had absolutely no luck finding a job so I stuck around retail.  During the past 5 years I went back to school and got an MBA... Graduated a year-and-a-half ago. Again, no luck with a job. I have started a small business (out of necessity) that is struggling but bringing in an extra 350-650 dollars a month.  I also work as a marketing consultant but I only get paid when I land jobs...which is rare.  Truth be told I hate it. I still work part-time in retail, and next year I will have been in retail for 10 years. 

At times in the past two years I've felt like I'm on the verge of breaking out, just right there on the cusp... Then things seem to disintegrate.  I have always had very bad luck with jobs and money.  I told my wife this when we started dating and she didn't believe me... Now she does.  She has watched things literally go up in smoke for me so many times she is convinced.  We're talking some eerily bad luck in regards to those things.  Whenever I have an extra $100 dollars in my account we both cringe because we know some $500-$1000 dollar expense is getting ready to crop up.  This happens like clockwork, and has for as long as I can remember.

I need advice on breaking out of this rut.  Even after working three jobs I barely have enough money to buy a cheeseburger most days, and truth be told the only reason I can even do that is because I had some loan money left over when I graduated that I've stretched out. By my best estimate this money will run out within the next month or so and I will no longer have money for bills.  

We just bought a house  -- Wife had to do everything in her name because banks won't touch me (I have over $50 grand in school debt and make $13000 a year) and I'm afraid that if something doesn't budge soon she is going to have to start paying all the bills.  Our relationship is rocky due to this already, and honestly I think she might ask for a divorce if things get much worse.

I am 27, I have an MBA, and I literally have no clue what it feels like to have a decent job.  I've always worked retail outside of the marketing consultant thing, but that is almost a joke at this point because all I'm doing is setting-up WordPress websites for local businesses and scratching together maybe $700 a month three or four months out of the year. When I stopped counting I had applied for over 150 jobs in my field and congruent fields... I have gotten a call-back once that didn't go anywhere.  I've had people look at my resume to see if they can figure out why I'm not getting calls, and nobody can figure it out.  I have a lot of experience in different things and I generally kick ass at work. 

When I get to the heart of it, here's the problem.  I'm going to sound like a real jerk but it's the truth: I'm a healthy, honest, dependable, moderately intelligent guy with two degrees and I can't catch a break.  I've hit all the switches I've been told to hit, applied to all the jobs, read all the self-help books, but I'm no closer to ""making it"" than I was 10 years ago when I was graduating high-school.  I'm actually $50,000 dollars farther away from making it when you factor in school.

So, for those of you who were in similar situations... Did the clouds just part one morning and things got better, or did you have to do something different?

1364318120.0,4,self.Advice,1b1vbd,I think I have depression (17 yo fruity Male from England),6,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1b1vbd/i_think_i_have_depression_17_yo_fruity_male_from/,"The following may be ineligible because I am in a hurry.
At the moment I am very frustrated with life. I am dyspraxic so I have alot of difficulties. I am not very good at being myself around people. I became very depressed over my summer holiday because I had no friends to talk to or go out with. When I started my new school I thought it'd be a great opportunity to make some friends. In order to make friends I'd act innocent and positive and outgoing. That is not really me. 

The surprising thing is that I have made some friends which is good and I have a humble social life but there are complications such as people thinking that I'm gay. I don't mind it so much but there is this girl I think I might be in love with who thinks Im gay.

 However recently I think she is changing her mind about that since I pretended to be drunk at a party so I could rub her leg and say nice things about her. I felt maybe I was coming on too strong but she is a huge cocktease with all the boys so I don't see the harm. I can tell she is a very unhappy girl. I get very jealous of all her guy friends with who she gets touchy-feely, even though I know it's not really serious. But the point is that she said that she said doesn't find me attractive and thinks of me as a brother and as pathetic. Maybe it's because lots of people think Im gay. In lessons I'd wear a fake smile so I can sort of see where they are coming from. I wanted to appear fresh faced. The thing is was that I was very desperate to make friends because my mum had an abusive boyfriend. 

 He'd threaten me with weapons and squeeze my body till it hurt. People kept on telling me that I should stay round the houses of my friends to avoid him but i wasn't close with anybody so I couldn't. They have been apart for a while now but she is thinking about getting back together with him.

Lately I have been doing alot of internal reflection. All day I imagine having conversations where I express things like my hetereosexuality and homelife with my classes. I tried to act like myself multiple times but I couldn't really decide what myself was. I've had alot of shit in my life and I think that's why Im attracted to this girl because I get the feeling there is more to her than meets the eye. She seems very vulnerable to boys and I think Im vulnerable to girls. A couple of times she's made out with girls which is weird because I might be a tiny bit gay. I get confused because sometimes I am attracted to boys I want to look like, I also sometimes have a sexual attraction to girls dressed up as boys. 

Sometimes I think it might be because my parents would fight alot when I was young. Even though I don't remember it, my mum says that I saw her get punched in the face by my dad. Also, I dont remember this either, he slammed my head shut in the door. According to the internet dyspraxia is caused by head injuries. It means that I can't take up any sports or instruments so I feel out of touch with the guys at my school.

If I admit they have some attraction to guys then I feel that I might miss on oppurtunities with girls because I hear that girls think a bisexual guy is more likely to cheat. To be fair, I do have the wandering eye for girls. I don't identify as bisexual however because I have a strong revulsion towards penises. Im not really sure because I only have ever been in one shitty relationship with a girl. I remember having a very strong sexual attraction to her but we never got to have any chemistry. We were never left alone together either. I want to try relationships with both sexes to see what I really want but that is so hard. Im also worried that if I dont have sex with a girl first then I might end more gay. Ive read that if you have a sexual relationship with a man when you are young that it can make you gay. My mum's boyfriend convinced her that I was in love with him when I wasn't. Something makes me think that he might've 'liked' me.

The worst thing of all is that I'm not sleeping at night or concentrating on my schoolwork because I have so much anxiety. I have an important essay that was due in yesterday but I don't write it because it's on a book with domestic violence and a weird little crazy boy that does peculiar things that remind me of myself. The dad in the book also has another wife in another country which I don't like because my dad left my family for another woman abroad. He took all his money with him so now Im living off the state. Its really hard because in my classes the richer kids bitch about people who live off the state. They say that people who live off the state smoke weed and don't look for a job. It's sad because I noticed that my mum does those things. One time she smoked so much weed that she turned super crazy and started having batshit hallucinations. The day that happened I was sick in school (it was just a coincedence). Her boyfriend had to pick me up because nobody could find my mum. He kept scaring me by saying that she was so crazy she might have killed herself. She had to be hospitalized for pshychosis.
If my schoolwork keeps on going badly then i might have to repeat the year but i find it so hard. my english teacher keeps on getting pissed off with me and sometimes she annoys me she tells my class that the dad in the book we are studying is a good father when I don't think he is. I am very upset because I wanted to go to a top university and I had a dream to go to a top university but I think ive been doing so badly lately that it wont be possible. 

I just feel so weird because I live in a rural area with nice normal people who dont really understand me. I talk to people in real life about my problems because Im worried they wont believe me. Ive tried doing so before but people refuse to believe. One time my sister's girlfriend told the school that I went to that I was getting abused but the school didn't want to do anything to avoid scandal. It would have been scandalous because my mum is a parents representative.

I'm pretty good at it, the pay is comfortable, I have a flexible schedule, and the commute's good.  The problem I have is with the higher ups.  I didn't have to deal with them early on, but ever since I got promoted I've had to deal with so much politics and incompetence it's been ridiculous.

I've lost all respect for them, and because of that I've grown abrasive to them.  However I'm one of their top workers, and I can keep the old, shoddy equipment running better than anyone else, so I'm indispensable and they don't want to fire me.

However, my cousin was hired a few years back after I got promoted and recommended him.  He's one of the better low level employees we have, yet he was asked not to come back for the upcoming season.  I'm pretty sure it was to spite me because of the attitude I give my superiors.

I'm doing a 5th year of high school due to my previous failures. I have failed grade 10 math twice, grade 11 math once, and grade 12 functions once. I have passed all these courses in summer school where it was much easier, apart from grade 12 functions. 

Now, my teacher suggested that I didn't take this course. I ignored his warning and went with it anyways, promising myself to work MUCH harder. And I did not break that promise. I work hours everyday, breaking my back on this calculus homework, doing all the problems, and everything.

I have failed both unit tests so far. I don't understand what's going on. I study so much, yet I always fail. At this rate, I won't even be getting a post secondary education as I won't get accepted anywhere. I'll be forced to work in my dad's business or work a shitty job my entire life. I'm even considering suicide over this, I know i'm not smart, and I don't feel bad when I fail without studying, but when I fail while busting my ass, I have no hope to live.

Now, while i'm preparing for the next test this Friday, i'm suspecting a few things:
1. I'm still not working hard enough
2. I need to do tougher problems

But the last one I know for sure is going on:
3. My teacher is grading me unfairly

I look at the tests of my peers, and from the same mistakes that are made, i'm getting deducted MUCH more in marks. Our tests are usually out of 40, so getting 1.5-2 marks off almost every question for minor errors really brings my mark down. I suspect that I have an 80% understanding of the material, but I only recieve 40% grades. I don't know what's going on.

If it helps, on my next test I will scan my paper and a peer's, to help compare the marks. I don't know if it's just my natural defense suspecting unfair marking, but it really seems like it. If I am being graded unfairly what should I do about it?

I am a 19 years old guy from Quebec, Canada. I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life until late high school, where my emphatic nature had me leaning towards psychology. I'd like to help others with their problems (the irony).

A year and a half ago, I discovered music production, electronic music that is. I used to do it for a hobby, but I always thought that I would really enjoy making a living out of it, I guess. 
When I start making a song, I usually stop doing alot of other stuff, including homework. I'm starting to acculmulate a bit of delay (right word?) in my studies, having not done anything for about two weeks.

Obviously, this really doesn't help me in my motivation. I feel pretty confused right now, and this is my last semester until university. 
I really want to go to university, probably more for the ""student life"" than for the studies themselves. I've always been thrilled about living the next years by myself, with friends and in a different, bigger city. 

My question is, what should I do? I think that if I can make up for all the delay at school my motivation will raise back up. I should end this semester with success and then, maybe, think about what I wanna do, I guess?
I'm kind of answering to my question myself. Typing this really kind of helps me clear my mind and try to find solutions by myself.
I still believe I need your thoughts though.

I have a very good friend, who I've been spending most of my time with and he's at heart a good guy. However he is an ASSHOLE. Not quite grade A, but probably grade B. He seriously seems to lack any kind of empathy. He'll be playing NHL 10 while his two brothers and I want to watch a movie or something, and he somehow reasons that were OK with that. We say, Anon we don't want to fucking watch you play NHL-10 we want to watch the venture brothers. He thinks that means ""after this round that you just started that will probably last 30 minutes will you allow us to watch TV?"". We try not to let him play music anymore, because instead of playing something from the LONG list of music we all collectively love, he'll play something that he wants to play, that we've all heard a million times. Which is usually either one of a few dubstep songs, or math rock but that's besides the point.

He does other things like assuming because he wants something to happen, that it will happen. Without making any attempt to actually make it happen. 

He seems to have this god complex, where he thinks that he is the center of the universe and that everyone around him is OK with that. He really is a good guy at heart, I just don't think he realizes what he's doing. I say this because he had 9 concussions in his adolescence, which might obviously cause some frontal lobe damage that would impair things like judgement and empathy.  He also used to have a drinking problem, once again in his adolescence.

To protect her identity, i'll use a false name of Jessica. We were madly in love, and spent all of our time together. We shared the same interests, did the same things, but still were different enough to still have things to talk about/intellectual arguments/discussions. Anyways, she suffers from the mental illness [dysthymia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia), and was moderately depressed through out most of our relationship, but we were still happy as a couple.    As high school came to a close, we ended up going to the same college (not because of eachother, honest). 


During the beginning of college, we took a small ""break"" because she wanted me to get a job and wanted to work out a few personal things before being committed to a person. We agreed to not see anyone during this time. During a speech about the dangers of drinking during orientation, she is struck with a repressed memory of her ex boyfriend anally raping her. This pretty much ruins her. Throughout the next 2-4 months or so, she tries to kill herself 3 times. During the biggest attempt, I am forced to call the ambulance on her because she overdosed on her pills for dysthymia. I sit through with her while she is on suicide watch, and make sure no harm comes to her. I then go through rape therapy with her and try to help her get back on her feet. We agree to not have sex for until she feels she is ready (about 4-5 months til the breakup). We stay together, and are somewhat happy during that time. She tells me she is still recovering. At the start of this summer (now my sophomore year of college) she dumps me. She says that after all of the things she has been through, she needs space. Jessica claims to have lost all sense of her own identity, and can only find herself as ""us"", in a couple. I respected her wishes, and we parted ways. 

Tonight, I speak to her for the first time in 3 months. I found out that during our break, she had cheated on me with a close friend. I spoke to the guy she cheated with, and he felt terrible and apologized to me. They had sex. When Jessica and I were talking, she told me that they had only made out and nothing more serious than that had happened. She lied to my face. I then ask her if she had seen anyone since we had broken up. Apparently shortly (1-2 weeks) after she dumped me because she didn't need to be in a relationship, she was fucking another guy.
