If you feel inclined to call, the number to his DC office is **(202) 225 4311**. PLEASE BE KIND TO STAFF! They didn't vote. They just work there. 

I also went to his office here in Nashville just now and they simply told me the DC office ""would be more helpful than they would."" Which I was blown away to hear but just responded with a thank you and left. They are only staff and I'm not going to blow up on them or anything.

Sure you'd like to cut down on the repetitive, I'm visiting what should I do posts. But being a dick about it isn't going to fix that.

How about we invest some time into making the FAQ not just a list of stuff. If I was visiting somewhere and wanted a list of restaurants I'd just google maps the area I'd be in... The FAQ needs some depth, reasons why people should go certain places, what makes one different than another, and what about it is particularly interesting that it draws redditors. I haven't been in Nashville very long and have only visited a couple places on the list so I'm not really someone who has the knowledge to do this.

People ask where to go because they what someone to endorse a particular place for a particular reason, it's the social aspect of knowing a fellow redditor holds a good opinion of a place and their reason for it is something that you happen to enjoy as well, not that it just happens to be on some list.

I think the best way to go about it would to have short but descriptive endorsements, kind of like the one's on the back of DVD boxes, along with the name of the redditor, for all of the recommendations in the FAQ.",,False,self,t5_2qimh,False,,,True,t3_11avyi,http://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/11avyi/a_suggestion_for_the_nashville_faq_and_a_plea_for/,

It is my understanding that they charge $75+ for rental listings that they just have by perusing Craigslist and other websites. I work in real estate and literally every single person I have ever talked to who has said that they used Hometown Rentals had to pay for a list of available properties and the properties were expired/already rented to someone else *months* prior and/or the prices/rent per month were listed significantly lower than what it was supposed to be. I fully believe that this place is preying on and scamming people--especially those from out of town. 

If you're looking for rental properties, I suggest Craigslist and a simple Google search for ""property management"" in Nashville. I would almost guarantee that no property management company in this town would ever charge you money for a list of what they have available--most of them have it on their website and the rest will have a physical list that you can pick up at their office (for free).

I'd invite more but there's just not enough room in our apartment for more people. Hope to see you here.

I babysat for this family a few years ago for a summer, and knew the children and Marylea (the grandmother) very well. At the time, their mother was in jail for drug charges, and Marylea was taking care of them. 
Four years later, their lives were finally getting back on track. Jonathan (the young boy who was stabbed) was a boy scout ever since I met him, and was on his way to reaching eagle. The young girl (whom I shall not name due to confidentiality) finally had her mother back, who she would tell me about once a week after she had her weekly phone call. She would dream of the things that her and her mother would do once she was out of jail. 
And now everything has been ripped away from her. She has already had such a hard life, and now things will be even tougher. This little girl has one of the biggest hearts that I have ever seen in a young child. She does not deserve this.

If you would like to donate to fund her education and living situation, please donate to the Harpeth Valley PTO Burial and Benevolence Fund (Harpeth Valley Elementary is the school she attends, so it would go straight to helping her.) at the Pinnacle Bank on Hwy 70 S. 

I've seen Reddit do some amazing things - and I know that this girl is in severe need of all the help that Reddit can give. I do not really know any way to help her other than through this fund. If anyone else knows of anything else that can be done to help, i'm all ears.

Edit: You can now make donations online at https://www.hvburialfund.com/ . A candlelight vigil will be held this Saturday, September 8, 2012 at Red Caboose Park at Hwy 70 and Colice Jean Rd, across the street from Bellevue Middle School.

My fiancee and I have been seriously researching what it would take to start up a geeky, gaming cafe or bar in Nashville. (Akin to AFK Tavern, the Brooklyn Strategist, 1-UP Barcade, or Snakes and Lattes.) Obviously we don't want to put a ton of time and effort into something that wouldn't appeal to Nashville geeks, so I figured I'd throw this out to Nashville's redditors for some informal polling since they probably trend more geeky than the average Nashvillian.

The basic idea is to have a place that serves food and drink; has a big collection of board games that anyone can play; hosts events such as nerd rock concerts, cult movie nights, and costume parties; stays open all night, at least on weekends, for hardcore gaming (and because Nashville has a sorry lack of 24-hour food options); probably has some classic arcade games; and so on ad infinitum. (We have a LOT of ideas for events.)

Is this a place where you'd spend your time? Are there particular things that such a place would HAVE to have to make it worth your while? (For example, ""I would only go there if I could get a beer"" or ""I like classic video games but I don't care about tabletop games"" and so on.) If this doesn't appeal to you, why not? (Even if you're just not a geek.)

Thanks for your honest feedback! ",,False,self,t5_2qimh,False,,,True,t3_18vzn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/18vzn9/interest_in_a_geekgamer_event_space/,

I'm friendly, but I don't know how to make friends, apparently. I'm straight (but it's totes ok if you aren't), in a committed, long-term relationship and I have loads of guy friends. But I'd like to hang out with girls who are at least vaguely interested in things like shopping and nail polish and make-up and the like. I'm very liberal-minded, sort of a homebody (which makes making and/or keeping friends even more difficult for me sometimes), and if you lose me at a party, chances are I'm with either the gayest or highest people there. If you yourself are looking for a friend-girl or you know someone who is, send me a message please. Maybe we can meet up for dinner/drinks/mani-pedi soon.

I've been doing photography on the side for over 6 years now. I shoot seniors, weddings, and models. I have been trying to get more clients for the longest through marketing, but the only way I bring in new people is through friends and former clients referals. So I figured I'm going stick with what's working. Reddit is a great community and I want prove myself to you all and then maybe get referals for more business. 

So here's the plan. I'm going to give a free wedding photography package to whoever gets the most comment upvotes. You have to be getting married in either 2013 or 2014. How you go about getting your upvotes is up to you. It can be a sob story, funny story about how you and your fiance met, or just some random comment that end up at the top. If the top comment is not a person that's getting married it will go down to the next person until we get to somebody that is.

After the wedding, OP will deliver photos for you all to see. If the photos please you, let the word of mouth commence.

Just got this info on my neighborhood association's mailing list and wanted to pass it on. I know folks have come on here in the past looking for access to dental care. Maybe this can help a fellow redditor.

----------------------------------------------

Hello! 
 
It's Neighborhoods InspireHealth Again!!
 
A shiny car, a glass of finely aged wine, a lake house: some things are luxuries.  Dental care should **NOT** be.  After reviewing feedback from the blue bag surveys you completed this summer, access to dental care was a need identified by some members of our community. This is why we are bringing a **FREE DENTAL CLINIC** to the Easley Community Center on October 13th from 10:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. for individuals without dental insurance and/or the means to obtain proper dental care. 
 
**BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP!!**
 
**Here is what we need:**
 
**Your voice:** Help us spread the word. If you know of someone who does not have insurance and/or access to dental care, please tell them about the clinic. [(A pdf flyer for the event.)](http://www.mindspring.com/~nashvilleguy/Dental%20Clinic%20Poster%202012%2010%2013.pdf)
 
**Your time:** We are expecting a big crowd and could use some help! We need greeters, ushers, help with children's activities, as well as set up/clean-up. Shifts are 8 a.m. - 12 p.m. and 12 p.m. - 4 p.m. (ages 12 and up) 
 
**Your snacks:** Our amazing volunteers will be working very hard all day and our patients may have a long wait before they are seen. Donations for water, coffee, and healthy snacks would be appreciated.
 
**Your support:** The dental clinic is completely FREE to participants but there are still costs involved in making it happen. The average cost is just $10 per patient, and we expect 100- 150 patients.  If you could donate at least $10, that would support one neighbor in need and make future clinics possible.
 
If you can help with any of the above items, please contact Heather Dubuque with Neighborhoods InspireHealth. 
 
**Email:** HDubuque@InspireHealth.com
**Phone:** 615.771.0700 
 
[**Event Details**](http://www.mindspring.com/~nashvilleguy/Dental%20Clinic%20Poster%202012%2010%2013.pdf)

**What?**    Free Dental Clinic and Health Screenings
 
**When?**   10 a.m. - 3 p.m. (Registration from 9 a.m. - 2 p.m. on a first come, first serve basis)
 
**Where?**  Easley Community Center (1000 Edgehill Avenue, Nashville, TN 37203)

**Who?**   Individuals without dental insurance and/or the means to obtain proper dental care. 
 
**More about us...**

Hope Smiles seeks to bring hope through healing to those living in local and regional communities and nations around the world where dental  care is overlooked, unavailable, or not affordable.

Even if we get some rain unless it is a major amount we still have horribly volatile conditions for forest fires. As terrible as it is I personally recommend holding off on fireworks this year, or if you do keep it small and keep a source of water nearby like a water hose and be ready to use it quickly if something goes bad. The worst things to use it seems are the fountains, displays, etc.,and rockets. Especially the rockets that have little parachutes or something like that can just be that much more likely. All it takes is one little ember to start a huge fire, and rockets are bad about doing to so far away you don't notice or can't do anything until it is too late. Also fountains and stuff are probably a bad idea unless you do it in a parking lot or something, even in a street they could start the grass on the shoulder on fire.

Many areas don't have burn or firework bans, while others do. There's been a lot of confusion and disagreement and therefore it is going to be up to the people to exercise caution and keep the holiday from being a disaster with this heat and dryness.

The fires we've had thus far have been rough to fight as everything burns very easily. LBL recently had some fires due to negligence  that did quite a bit of damage and were difficult to contain.


In these conditions fires can happen quick and from almost everything, and they move very fast. Even when cautious things can happen, but if it does happen do not hesitate to call 911 and make it clear to the dispatcher that it is in or going to be in the trees.

Ill keep this as short as I can.
My mom and dad just split (they lived in Michigan), So he decided he was going to move to your city to be with his Brothers, and other family members. He is currently living out of a campground because he doesn't have enough savings for a place.

He has over 20 years experience with carpentry. He is skilled in everything from roofing, to electrical, to general carpentry. He is in need of some steady income. He doesn't know I am posting this, and Im not sure any one will care, or help. But I needed to give it a shot.

He is also an amazing musician. He has played guitar since he was a child, and would even be great to work as an instructor, or is some kind of music position. I know this whole post is vague, I'm sorry. If you have questions please respond, I will give as much detail as I know. Just trying to help my dad out.

I can send a resume if need be

Links are provided to the websites for all of them, so you can get more info there and a lot of them have directions. Be aware, most are cash only.


A couple notes before I get going; first of all, I don't get scared at these personally, so some of this is based on what happened to people I'm with when I go through these, so if I went through by myself, it's a bit harder to gauge some of the things that might set you off, so your mileage may very, and it also means I'm not so sold on sensory overload things. If strobes, darkness, and loud noises work for you, then your tastes will be different. Finally, I'm from Los Angeles, so I'm very thrown off by this whole 'woods' thing going here. Finally, crowds are changing since I went through these, so the group sizes may be bigger and waits may be longer (I also went to some on Sundays, and those are very light crowds)


Here we go...

[Monster Mountain](http://monstermountain.net/) - Hendersonville -$15 - 45 min - Fri 9/29 -3/5

This was the first one I went through, and it remains the longest I went through, so you certainly get your money's worth in that sense. This one was fairly all terrain and is outside, and you basically go through a bunch of different 'movie sets' as the overall theme is that you're going through a studio. This basically lets them put together a bunch of different things and have an umbrella theme. Lots of walking, including steps and tunnels and the like. All in all, I wasn't too impressed with the talent, but it was still early in the season, and the decor was extensive, lots of old cars and other large pieces.

[Creepy Hollow Haunted Woods](http://www.creepyhollowwoods.com/) - Spring Hill - $15 - 25 min - Sat 9/30 -3/5

The creepiest place to get to for a guy used to the suburbs, getting here does involve going up a small, fairly unmarked dirt road into the trees. The haunt actually consists of three sections, the first section is going through a barn, the second section is a haunted woods outdoors, and this one seemed to do a fairly good job of keeping things going throughout, rather than individual sections. Then, it finished up with a standard maze. There is also a hayride here that you can do for an extra $5; seems more aimed for kids, and so I didn't try it. The decor, on the whole, wasn't too impressive, but the setting for it was very good. They may well put you into larger groups, though (I was added to the group behind me).

.

.

[Millers Thrillers](http://www.millersthrillers.net/) - Columbia - $15 - 30 min - Sat 9/30 - 4/5

Millers Thrillers is much more of an event than any other haunt. There is a $5 entry fee if you're not getting a ticket for something else since they have a stage set up with live entertainment, a band and a magician. Not sure if they change up the bands. The haunt is all outdoors, and had some of the most visually impressive settings for that, although half the trouble on this one, for me anyway, is just how steep the path gets at some points. The really interesting concept that they have here is that for $20 (or $30 if with the haunt), they also have a hayride where you shoot zombies (live people in costume). The trailer that you ride on has paintball guns attached to it, so that you can aim a little bit. The concept is great, and it lasts about 15 minutes, but the big problem for me is that too many spots involved pulling into an area, and having someone standing there as you shoot them. No sport in that. The best spots were areas where you had zombies coming at you through the brush or things like that. I'd say probably not worth the money, but I hope they improve it. This one had some definite lines to it, and I still had a half hour wait or so this early, and I was put in with two other groups when I went in.

.

.

[Death Valley Haunted Woods](http://www.deathvalleyhauntedwoods.com/) - Hendersonville - $15 - 35 min - Fri 10/5 -3/5

Decent length, but that's with a fair bit of padding. A lot of this is outside, as a haunted woods would be, but it doesn't have that same open feeling other haunted woods do, as most of it is outside, but with very narrow walls, just not covered. The talent was not very impressive since they basically just relied on hitting something loud very near you while you were in the dark. That said, they did do a pretty good job of using darkness, and there are actually a few sections of maze to this one, and the mazes were pretty good, although I think they're probably a little too ambitious to show people the right way out. The latter half was better and had some better settings and design. With how densely packed the paths are here, it does give the nice sort of ambiance that you can hear chainsaws going somewhere much of the time, even though you've got no idea when you'll reach that.

.

.

[Bloody Acres Haunted Woods](http://bloodyacres.webs.com/) - Gallatin - $15 - 30 min - Fri 10/5 - 4/5

Another Haunted Woods, this is basically the opposite of Death Valley Haunted Woods in setting. This one is very spread out, and is a pretty long walk in the woods. A good chunk of it is just walking through the woods, and the shame of it is that some of those areas are very creepy, but there's a definite staffing problem here, and it really needs about 3 or 4 more people, as there are some patterns that show up otherwise. That said, the talent here did impress me, so while they could use more people, the ones that they have do a good job of things. It also takes you through all the basic horror movie characters from the 80s or so. Their chainsaw guys are also manage to get back into the terrifying range with how they handle their chainsaws. Sure, it's supposed to be safe.... but they manage to offset the precautions of not having chainsaws with chains by how they use them. So, scary, but in a bit of a legitimate sense.

.

.

[Slaughterhouse](http://www.slaughterfest.com/) - Nashville - $15 - 20 min - Sat 10/6 - 3/5

Located in a warehouse next to the convention center, Slaughterhouse, even this early, had a line of about half an hour or so, and it moved very slow. The talent working the line did a pretty good job of keeping things entertaining, though. There were a couple good effects once you're inside, using doors is a nice touch to make it harder to see what's coming, for example. There is also one effect in here that I really like and won't spill because it's all about the surprise with these things. That said, I don't really think it was the top one, but it's certainly more convenient than a lot of these if you're in central Nashville and really don't feel like a drive.

.

.

[Nashville Nightmare](http://nashvillenightmare.com/) - Madison - $15 - 30 min - Sun 10/7 - 5/5

Slow wait here, because even though I was there by myself, they sent me in on my own. From outside, I knew this was going to be good because of how detailed the exterior was (this is set in a large portion of a shopping center) as well as how detailed the talent working the line was. Not only were they good, but that they've got prosthetics is a good sign because it allows them to be more expressive, to talk easier, and mess with people better. This is actually broken up into three different segments, including a morturary and an old house. The talent here was amazing, and they really knew what they're doing. The decor was amazing, and there's a great balance between animatronic effects and live actors. If you've ever wanted to live a Scooby Doo episode, this is it. Sensors set off traps, so to speak, and people in costume trying to scare you. A good part of my enjoyment was trying to spot find the sensors that would set stuff off, but there's so much in there that if you're not like me, you'd never really notice them with how well decorated the place is. The cemetary there, alone, was breathtaking, personally. If I go back anywhere with people, it would be here. This is one of the best haunts I've ever been through anywhere.

.

.

[Mad House Haunt](http://www.madhousehaunt.com/) - Lebanon - $15 - 20 min - Fri 10/12 - 1/5

This one is entirely within a large warehouse, although the walls of everything only go up about 10 feet, then it's open to the top of the warehouse. This basically means that you can see effects from elsewhere somewhat as lighting spills over, and that does somewhat kill the illusion. I'm fairly impressed with the layout, as they manage to weave you around so that you come by the same people multiple times and that makes the staffing seem higher than it was. That said, a lot of the decoration seemed a bit simple, and the talent, while trying to be fairly interactive (generally a plus) wasn't too good at it. That said, I was sent through this one with another group that included a couple kids, so I can't rightly tell what it would have been like without them. Overall though, I wasn't impressed with this one. If you do check this out, their website had a  coupon you can print out to receive $2 off.

.

.

[Dead Land Woods](http://www.deadlandwoods.com/) - Lebanon (south of) - $15/$25 - 25/25 min - Fri 10/12 - 5/5

Dead Land actually has two haunted trails, both of which are listed as being a mile long. the lines are fairly slow, but they also put me through one by myself, and only put me with other people on the other when I said I'd be fine with that. So group numbers are kept down. The first was The Curse, and there's actually a whole video that they have you start off watching while you're in line. The talent here was really good, and the trail follows the arc from the video for the first section, so it's very immersive in that sense. The second trail is The Portal, which was awesome. This one is themed to be entering into the world of fairy tales and nursery rhymes, and the atmosphere on this was extremely well done. It's a series of set pieces, but the ways they intepretted it was great. I'd not call it creepy, personally, but visually I thought it was very nicely executed. Two different, but great, experiences.

.

.

[Death Row](http://www.deathrowhauntedhouse.net/) - Nashville - $12 - 25 min - Sat 10/13 - 2/5

This one has, by far, been getting the most advertising, it seems. And the lines showed. I waited over an hour for this one. The talent working the lines were pretty good, but it almost goes downhill when you get inside. Death Row is heavily based around having you walk through strobes in a large group (I think it was over 10 people, and at least 3 different groups). Most of the stuff you see is stationary props or simple animatronics with excessive gore, and while some of the talent is good, they're also almost non-existant. Very underwhelming, personally, but it still gets its scares.

.

.

[Gorehouse](http://www.gorehouse.net/) - Hendersonville - $13 - 20 min - Sun 10/14 - 4/5

This is a first time haunt, and it shows that they're just getting established in the relatively short experience. That said, the talent here is great (their guy working the line spent 15 minutes trying to mess with me while i waited for them to open for the night and he knew what he's doing). The design on this place is great, and they've got a good concept developing as they repurpose a building that had been another haunt previously. This is also one that does a very good job of messing with ones expectations. I hope to see this one does well because the people behind it have some great perspective on how to make one of these well crafted and well designed. This has the potential to become even more awesome in coming years as they add some length to it.

.

.

[Devil's Dungeon](http://www.devilsdungeon.net/) - Nashville - $15 - 30 min - Sun 10/14 - 3/5

This one apparently has a lot of controversy tied to it. Whole Church of Satan thing that it starts off with, and I've also got very mixed feelings with the 'scary homosexual' bit about half way through. So be forewarned. All is set indoors, with and the first half of it is mostly really loud metal playing and strobe lights. It's generally a let down in that sense, although there's a few good rooms in it. The maze, though, is very impressive, and took a good several minutes on it's own. And unlike most other mazes, this one is legitimately in near total darkness, and they are not a 'safe area', unlike most mazes. They're definitely the redeeming part here, as the talent was fairly hit and miss, and parts of it just seem like it's trying to be shocking for the sake of being shocking.

.

.

TL;DR Highlights:

Best Haunted Attraction: Nashville Nightmare

Best Haunted Trail: Dead Land Woods

Up and Coming: Gore House

Most Unique: Millers Trillers (for the zombie shoot hayride)

Most for Your Dollar: Nashville Nightmare or Monster Mountain

I'm completely beside myself now and don't really know what to do... just wanted to inform the community... be safe y'all 

UPDATE: Thanks for the kind words everybody. No word yet on my car or any of the suspects (I'm not really holding my breath). Just a reminder, if you see any people acting suspicious, call and let the police know... better safe than sorry as they say. Also, for any of you that live in the sylvan heights/park neighborhood I believe there will be a sylvan heights community group meeting sometime next week where they will be talking about this incident and ways that we as a community can take steps to prevent it from happening again.

&gt;(Note: This is not an exact location, merely a placeholder until I have time to go confirm the location in person. Its been a while.)
 Somewhere in the hills between Bellevue and Fairview (off of Hwy 100, just past the Natchez Trace Pkwy) is an abandoned fallout shelter. 
  I can't say for sure, but I assume that it was built sometime in the early to mid-1950s and was meant to house the State and/or Metro government in the event of a nuclear attack on Nashville. (They must have thought the Soviets were really stupid, if they actually expected them to waste a nuke on Nashville back then.) Since the Cold War ended in 1991, it is probably safe to assume that the shelter has not been actively maintained in roughly 20 years.

I figured that you guys might be interested too, so without further ado, here's copypasta of things to do in Nashville this week:


What's going down this week, you ask?? May 30 - June 5


Okay, so... Lots of stuff happening this week. This isn't a comprehensive list because I lost my comprehensive list. Feel free to add your events to this list! Please indicate time, location, and cost.


**TODAY, Monday May 30** -- Cheekwood Gardens is FREE from 9:30-4:30


**WEDNESDAY, June 1** -- Movies in the Park @ Centennial Park bandstand. Starts at sunset. This week features the movie ""500 Days of Summer."" Pack a picnic! FREE


**THURSDAY, June 2** -- First Thursday Art Walk @ Hillsboro Village. 7 pm-ish. Free!! Come drink free wine and look at art you don't get!


Free Admission with a college ID @ the Frist. 


I feel like I'm forgetting something else...


**FRIDAY, June 3** -- Free Admission with a college ID @ the Frist. 


Tango in the park @ Centennial Park bandstand. Starts at 7 pm, I believe. FRIZZLE fo shizzle! 


Sudekum Planetarium Star Party @ Bell Bend Observatory. 8:30 pm. Directions to Bell Bend Observatory here 


Tales By Twighlight Presents Playing By Air Jugglers @ Red Caboose Ampitheater, Bellevue. 7:00-8:00 pm. Free!!


Taste of Music City @ Public Square Park. 5:30-8:30 pm. $25. See the [web site](http://www.tasteofmusiccity.com/) for more details


**SATURDAY, June 4** -- Rainbow Run/Walk @ Shelby Bottoms Greenway, 7 a.m. FREE!!


Farmers Market @ Coleman Park and Richland Park, 9 a.m. Free!!!


Musicians Corner @ Centennial Park. 3 pm. FREE!!!

Big Band Dance @ Centennial Park bandstand. 7:30-10:00 pm. FREE!!

Downtown Art Crawl @ The Arcade, downtown. 7 pm-ish. FREE!

(Apparently there's also a wedding in Centennial Park at 3 pm, so, ya know, go wish them a happy life of mutual indentured servitude. Actually, that's probably not a good idea. People showing up and saying ""I heard about it on the Internet"" is not going to make the bride happy.)


**SUNDAY, June 5** -- HWEN Sunday Concert Series @ Fannie Mae Dees Park (The Dragon Park for us locals). 4 p.m. Free, I assume...


Okay, that's everything I can think of this week. Plenty to do, so please make a post if you're interested in attending anything and we'll try to get groups together!

The latest contract was voted down by 90 percent of the union members due to increase in costs to insurance, part time workers losing benefits(Kroger doesn't hire full time anymore), and a puny raise over the next four years. 

Taken from the UFCW 1995's Facebook
""The Kroger Company's Best Offer was rejected by the membership by more than 90%. We have contacted Federal Mediation to inform them and ask for the Company's earliest dates to return to the bargaining table. We will keep you informed.""

Apparently they are suppose to try mediation tomorrow, but from what my roommate has told me Kroger doesn't seem to want any part of it. So take it for what you will. 

----

**Update** My roommate showed me the letter that the management is spreading to the workers.

December 6, 2012

To Our Associates :

We regret to inform you that the union has reported to us that Kroger's ""Comprehensive Best Offer"" has failed to receive sufficient votes for ratification.

We are very disappointed because our offer provided:* 

* Several wage increases and two substantial lump sums. The first wage increase and lump sum for eligible associates would have been ***effective immediately*** had the agreement been ratified

* A commitment by the company to pay all health insurance costs for eligible associates minus your co-insurance, deductible(s), copay(s) and weekly contributions. This would have ensured your Health and Welfare program would be ***financially sound***

* Stable pension benefits made possible with substantial Company investments to your Pension funds

We know you must be wondering what this means for you. Your current contract extension remains in place. You will continue to work under the terms of the existing contract. However, your health care benefits ***are now at risk***. Current financial projections indicate that the Health and Welfare fund will be out of cash beginning the last week of December and the ***Trustees will be required to make significant changes.***

The company is evaluating next steps. We will keep you informed as we have new information. If you have questions, we *encourage* you to talk to your Store Manager.

Sincerely,
John Hackett",,False,self,t5_2qimh,1355106541.0,,,True,t3_14k8kc,http://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/14k8kc/kroger_employee_strike_looming/,

So this is the part where you're overwhelming desire to help and my normal guy attitude meetup. Honestly I will probably just need a solid place to lay down and if possible a high pressure shower. I am not trying to eat all your frosted flakes or meet your girlfriend. Just a little reddit leap of faith. If nothing happens on here I will probably just look for a Nashville hostel but I thought I'd do the creppy thing first and beg strangers.

Our program is not just about competition and athleticism. Nashville Junior Roller Derby accepts girls ages 10 - 17 that are all sizes, shapes, ethnicities, religions, etc. It becomes a 'family' for those kids that may not have a stable family life otherwise. It also becomes a caring structured activity for those kids that have not found the right sport for them. We have seen such a difference in attitude, personality, body image, and pride from the participants in our league. Your contribution helps ensure our program continues to provide a safe and healthy place for these young ladies to flourish!

2012 was a year of 'firsts' for our league. It was our first competitive season. One of our junior refs was the first junior ref allowed to ref a sanctioned adult bout. We were the first junior roller derby bout to be broadcast via the internet. What did it get us?

We ranked 13th internationally among the junior roller derby teams and got invited to bout at the Wild West Tournament next March! 

**Why is that important?**

Our league will get the opportunity to play in a tournament that features 6 of the top ten junior teams in the world. This is a huge deal for us, as it will set the pace and benchmark for our training program in 2013. 

**What We Need**
We need to send 15 skaters, 3 coaches, an announcer and a junior ref to Bremerton, WA from Nashville. We estimate needing $10,000 to help off-set the costs for our skaters and their families. This money will cover group airfare, hotel, transportation, and food for the league while in Bremerton.

It is kind of a piece of shit, rusty on the grill and beat up, but it's my means of transport, and it had my favorite pair of jeans in the back. 

The thing is, I left no gas (noticeably below the empty line), and the ignition doesn't turn. It had the key in last night, because if you take it out, or even turn it all the way back, the ignition is a bitch to get started. Like 30 minutes of trying to turn it sometimes. Anyways, the pic is of my model truck -just think dirtier and rustier. I'd bet that it didn't make it very far before they either ran out of gas or turned it off in a parking lot somewhere and couldn't start it again. Unless they got it to some shady salvage yard today. If you see it, would you please message me. License plate 691 ZCS Davidson County, last seen near 31st &amp; West End, Vandy area.

1352922250.0,20,self.nashville,13737i,I lost my iPhone today... Here's the story of how I got it back.,23,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/13737i/i_lost_my_iphone_today_heres_the_story_of_how_i/,"I keep my phone in an otterbox clipped to my belt.  Today, it became unsecured somehow and fell off during my morning commute on the bus.  Once I got to work, when I realized it was missing, I called my wife.  She told me that she had texted me earlier, and gotten the response, ""Wrong number.""  I had her use the Find My iPhone app, to send a message ""If this phone is found please call xxx-xxxx"".  The app also traced it to the Music City Central bus terminal.  I called their lost and found - no iPhones.  By this time my wife had called it several times, whereupon the individual actually answered the phone and then hung up twice.  That's when she remotely locked the phone.

Using the Find My iPhone app again, my wife could see the phone was now travelling down Broadway/21st/Hillsboro Rd.  My co-worker graciously allowed me to text from her phone: ""Whoever has this phone, you are being tracked.  We know where you are.  Please answer the next call!""  I called from my work number.  No answer.

A couple minutes later, my wife calls the office.  ""Some guy just called and said he's got your phone.  Here's his number.""  So I called it.  The voice tells me, ""Yeah I'm over here at the Krystal in Green Hills.  Some white dude just offered to sell me an iPhone for $75.  I bought it, then I realized, hey this is stolen!  So you can come get it, but if you could help me out, since I just spent the last $75 I have on this phone, I'd appreciate it.""  Pondering for a moment,  I then answered, ""Well, I'm bringing the cops with me, because you'll definitely need to file a police report with them, since you've been swindled out of $75.  Or, you could just leave the phone with the manager at the Krystal.""  A more than brief pause.  ""Yeah, okay.  I guess I'll just leave it here with them.  But if you need me, I'll be over here selling my papers.""  A few minutes later I called the Krystal and verified someone had indeed just left an iPhone.  I gave them my name and told them I would be by later to pick it up.

A few hours later, my co-worker gave me a ride to the Green Hills Krystal, where my iPhone was waiting.  Dude stole my otterbox.  Also, he had used my iPhone to call his own number (the one he gave my wife), I'm assuming so that he could know my phone's number.  

Just outside there was a gentleman selling The Contributor, right where he said he'd be.  Do I confront him?  I figured not, considering the otterbox was already worn out, and he obviously feels this could be of some value to him.  He needs it more than I do, I should think of it as a finder's fee.  Plus, I've got no real proof, just circumstantial evidence pointing me to a not-very-smart accidental criminal.

What burns me, though, is that 9 out of 10 Nashvillians would have been completely been forthright and honest in finding the phone's rightful owner, including the have-nots.  If he had been so inclined, I would happily have given him a $20 bill for keeping it safe, especially when I saw him selling papers.  But instead I got a bad taste in my mouth, and lost a little bit of trust in my fellow man.  

Or could I be wrong?  Am I overlooking something? Is there a possibility everything he said was true?  Does this qualify as a theft?  Am I unjustly judging this guy's character without sufficient evidence?  Am I overthinking this, and should just be happy I have my phone back?  r/Nashville, what would you have done?

TL,DR; I used Find My iPhone app to recover my lost phone and was given a flimsy story by a potential extortionist in Green Hills.

""Good Day!
Thank you for your response regarding to my AD posted on craigslist. The house is still available. However i was on a research trip to Brazil IN as a Consulting Engineers for International Projects and this is going to last for years and because of my long stay in Brazil IN, that is why i am  renting out my house and i need a responsible person or family that can take a very good care of the house on my behalf. I came over here with my family and i am not using any realtor or any agency company for my property because i have withdrew my keys and the house documents from them due to the inability of the people to rent my house regarding the price and that was the reason why i reduced the price to a lowest and affordable range. You can send me a text message on this number (402) 519-4038, because right now, i can only receive or send message due to the job or you can leave a voice message and i will get back to you asap..Please bear with me so that we can understand each other regarding to the rental..

Below are the description and the address of the house..

Number of Bedrooms: 2
Number of baths: 1.0
Square footage:850 
Pets are allowed!!!
Utilities: Already taking care of in the Rent
Rent Fund: $500
Refundable security Deposit: $500
House Address: 2413 N 16th Nashville, TN 37206
Available :AVAILABLE FOR MOVE IN IF YOU HAVE YOUR PAYMENT NOW!!

Note that you can only drive by to see the EXTERIOR PART of the house because i traveled with the keys and i will be shipping the keys and the house documents to you

via FedEx If you are still interested my house.

I've seen some previous posts where fellow redditors were looking for jobs and I figured that there are some lurkers out there who are interested as well.  We just had a few of our workers who went back to school for the year and we need drivers and movers ASAP. 

The posting on Craigslist [link](http://nashville.craigslist.org/lab/3232560719.html) pretty much sums it up.  If you're a strong guy who likes working hard then you have a great chance.  Come to our storefront at 4801 Alabama Ave, Nashville, 37209 and apply Monday through Friday anytime between 9 and 3.  

PROTIP: Bring a copy of your Motor Vehicle Record (if it's clean).  People who will be able to drive will have a higher probability of getting a call back for an interview.  They also get paid more.  The DMV is pretty close to our store, so you can stop there on the way. 

PROTIP: Be able to pass a drug-test.  You will be tested, guaranteed. ",,False,self,t5_2qimh,1346175563.0,,,True,t3_yx4ze,http://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/yx4ze/two_men_and_a_trucknashville_is_hiring/,

* Mexican purple building on nolensville that does ""bar girls"" **UPDATE: Redditor didn't contact me, online sources have verified my theory. Owners take a blind eye stance**

* Saigon Cafe on Charlotte pk **UPDATE: Went in, was told it was closed, they then turned off the ""open"" sign. About 10pm Friday. Will investigate further. **

* Golden Massage in green hills **Backpage advertisement for massage, mentioned ""young chinese girls"" so most likely just like MVP in dickson** **UPDATE: Verified legit, supposed to have the most attractive asian women in Nashville though.**

* The Noodle House on Charlotte pike ,Not open until weekend Houses a hidden club in the side of the building. (http://g.co/maps/vfhgv)

is there an end in site to this? i'm at the point where i'm mentally preparing to call their customer service and not leave them alone till they let me out of my contract, which runs for like 14 more months. thats probably a losing strategy, but at this point i just don't know what else to do. i'm paying for a smart phone and not even getting the services of a flip phone.

My husband is in the military and deployed Thursday, so my dad wanted to be there for him and for me. As my dad was diving Tuesday night, the transmission on his truck blew between Kansas city and Columbia Missouri. Of course, the part wasn't in and it would take days for it to get fixed. So what does my dad do? He spends $400 and gets on the nearest plane. My dad started in Columbia, Missouri, hopped to Memphis, then Atlanta, then Raleigh, North Carolina. He rented a car and drove 3 hours, arriving to a motel at 4 AM. He spent Thursday saying goodbye to his son-in-law for awhile and helping me cope. Friday he helped me pack my entire apartment up and down three flights of stairs every trip. (The heat index was 115) So today is Saturday Ans my dad wanted so badly to stop in Nashville to see the Grand Ole Opry. He says it's on his bucket list so we headed out. Instead we broke down about 100 miles east of Nashville and the Opry won't refund our tickets. TL;DR Anyone know of a car rental place open between Montry and Cookeville, TN?

I draw pictures (when I'm not shooting photos and videos). (see examples in link below)
My drawing portfolio from college was destroyed in a family dispute, so I don't have much left to show for those years of work. 2012 being my self-declared year to improve myself, I wanted to rebuild my portfolio but I'm out of practice. And I'd rather do portraits than still lifes. 


So, to get back in practice *and* maybe get some appreciation for some free art, may I draw your face?


What I need:

* at least 2 pics of your face, so I can get different angles

* no nudity, please... just want to be able to use these for portfolio or a local gallery, if I'm lucky. 

* hobby? likes? I would like to add some of your personality to your portrait? 

    (for example, you want to have a portrait with you smoking a pipe? 
Want an eyepatch? Want to be drawn with a My Little Pony?)

* Message me your address if you'd like me to send you the drawing. Otherwise, I'll scan it and post it.


[Small selection of my portfolio.](http://thinkfarfetched.carbonmade.com/projects/2357298#1)
The skeleton ones no longer exist. The others survived only because they were given to a friend.


* Edit: Formatting.


**Wow, thanks everyone for the pics! I am still missing some reference photos from some of you, so please send them along - either link in a message, or I'll send you my email.**

**I think I'll have to close up for now - I've got about 15 drawings to try out. I'm so out of practice, I have no idea how long it will take, but I'll try to keep each of you updated.**

**If there is a specific date that you want the drawing by, please let me know! That will give me some deadlines.

On the way back I won't have much leeway to wait around, so someone who can be punctual getting back to the airport is a must.

Also, if you didn't know you can make this trip via SeaPort Airlines which I think does memphis/jackson/knoxville/nashville twice a day for somewhere around $35 each way per leg. It leaves out of nashville, not smyrna. I think it's an 8AM flight and a 5PM flight.

My partner Courtney and I want to take you and our fellow Americans out for breakfast for part of a book we're writing: 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'. We'll be in Nashville this weekend and have an open spot for Saturday, 10/27. Wanna be our next breakfast stranger?

* [Breakfast with Strangers mainsite](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page - please like us](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

Let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'Nashville' in the subject line. 


**More details about our project**

On July 18, 2012 we hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.


**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. Here's a video we made when we launched our project: https://vimeo.com/44696027


**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

Some of you may know that today is the first day of training camp for the Titans, and we're just 42 days away from the first game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Now, I'm sure some of you frequent /r/NFL, which is one of the best subreddits here, and maybe a few of you know about /r/Tennesseetitans, but what the heck, man? /r/Tennesseetitans is one of the smallest subreddits population-wise, and that really negatively affects its content.

So I figured I'd go on a little recruiting drive to see if I can pull from the fanbase. We need subscribers, but more than that, we need stimulating discussion and news. I'm tired of being the only Titans fan on /r/NFL threads, defending the Music City Miracle as a lateral and weeping at the result of Super Bowl XXXIV. With the preseason just around the corner, the time to revitalize the fanbase is now- follow training camp battles, get to know the roster, watch Munchak's press conferences. *And then talk about it!*

I've tried a few, since I've been here.  Tried the Duck River first, it was pretty murky, and didn't smell all that great.  Did the Buffalo after that, it was clearer and had better scenery.  But I don't want to stop there, if there's something even better I'm missing.  If you have any suggestions, I'd like to find the cleanest, clearest, most beautiful stretch of river to spend the day in with some friends tomorrow.  Specific canoe rental venues are welcome as well. 

UPDATE: I've been researching the major rivers and canoe rental companies in the Nashville vicinity.  Here's what I have so far.
HARPETH: Gets points for convenience factor, however the river itself and many of the rentals appear less than stellar.
CANEY FORK: I was informed that due to so much rain on the Caney, that many rentals aren't even putting people in the water, because it is so high.  Some stating that it may be two more weeks before they can, and that's if there's no more rain.  
BUFFALO: There's quite a few options on the Buffalo, and it appears to be the best option in regards to the scenery and cleanliness of the water, within an hour of Nashville.  There are even better options, but they are much further out.  As Not_RyanGosling mentioned, the Hiwassee looks pretty awesome.

There was a pretty positive response (about 10 people said they would come) and I went ahead and booked a room. However, I just got an email from my school, whom through I booked the room, saying that my reservation would have to be cancelled. The two weeks after this reservation are spring break, so in effect it would be three week before I even have to opportunity to get this room again. Because there was a pretty positive response I don't want to totally call off the idea, so I'm asking you redditors is anyone can help. Anyone think that maybe we could use their house, or their business after hours to jam? I know it's a long shot but I think this is a pretty good idea and I don't want to see it go to waste. It would be especially helpful if there was a drum set, but if not, we can still work something out.

also, if you want to join in on the jam, send me a message.

TL;DR:  Looking for a place for 5-10 redditors to jam either this sunday or sometime in the next week, anybody got a place?

Here's a quick synopsis:
-The place smelled more like mold and must, than friend chicken (after seeing the place I should have checked their health inspection score before ordering) 
-Waited nearly 30 minutes for a simple order, and the place wasn't even busy
-Ordered Quarter Thigh/Leg ""Hot"", with a side of French Fries and Baked Beans
-Chicken itself tasted good and was at least fresh, but the seasoning was super gritty and wasn't really even that hot, which I thought was the point.
-The French Fries had to be from a freezer bag and tasted worse than the ones they served in the grammar school cafeteria.  Until now thought that was impossible.
-The baked beans actually tasted alright, but were served in a container slightly larger than a thimble.
-I love a good endorphin rush from eating spicy food, but the only rush I got in the end was on my way to the loo. If I'm going to endure a violent anal raping, via spicy food, it better fucking taste good to be able to justify the ends.

The State may issue daily permits (conditions to be specified tomorrow morning) to stay from 9am to 4pm.

I'll be on a visit this weekend (fly in Friday morning, fly out Sunday afternoon).  I'm looking for suggestions as to things I can do while there which will give me a good feel for what it's like to live/work there.  I'm not looking for typical one-off tourist stuff that people normally do on city visits, because those typically wear out quickly.  I'm more interested in things that are more typical of day to day life there.  Obviously hitting a few big attractions isn't out of the question, but I don't want to spend both days taking walking tours and riding buses.  


If it helps any, I'm a white male in my late 20s who works in an IT/Programming related field.  No wife or kids.  I love music (though not country), film, and being outdoors.  I'm open to any suggestions you might have, as I'm more than happy to try the unfamiliar.


Further, any read you have on the neighborhoods will be helpful.  I'd prefer to live closer to downtown if possible.  Germantown and East Nashville seem like strong contenders at this point, but I've gotten mixed vibes on both those from everything I've read (both here and other sources).  The only neighborhood that has been pretty universally derided is Antioch, so that's not in consideration.  My office will be in the eastern part of Nashville, within a couple miles of the downtown area.  In my dreams I'd like to keep my car as a sort of backup and ride a bicycle whenever possible.

We rely on volunteer labor to help accomplish our mission. Most of the time, a large corporate or college group will come out and volunteer for a few days and then fly home. This is great, but we are also looking to get a pool of local volunteers together that we can rely on to help us out and hopefully develop more long-term relationships with.

 We always need general volunteers to help us out on builds. We need also need House Captains , who are generally skilled in construction, to lead groups of volunteers. 

If you have any interest in volunteering your time, we would greatly appreciate it. Feel free to contact me at esires@rebuildingtogethernashville.org

**Wednesday, the 30th** really wish I could edit that title.

I'm a Memphian. Please don't hold that against me. My date flaked on me for the Louis CK show **Wednesday** evening two weeks from now. I'm still going. I'm a 35 year old non axe murdering guy. I have a place to stay so I'm not going to hit you up for that. I'll give you a lift or meet you there or for dinner beforehand. I smoke- just in case that's an issue for driving, although I won't smoke with others in the car.  My only requirement is that you do not kill or rape me. Send me a message if your interested. 

**THE DATE IS THE 30th it is a Wednesday- MY BAD**  

**Edit #2**   

* I am really bad with dates. (calendar kind) 

* I do not wish to pay for an escort (didn't think I'd ever see those messages in my inbox- thanks for the pics though)  

* I am neither a top nor a bottom. The gay community seems to be very forward. Although I think my friends are trolling me.

* Just want to grab dinner and see a show with someone who enjoys Louis.  Guy or girl does not matter. I do not have an online dating profile to send you.

* I don't think it matters, but many have asked- I'm 5'10 180 kind of fit and no neckbeard.  I'm not looking to get married.

Apparently there's something called ""college football"" that means we can't do many Barcrafts on Saturdays until after December. ;/ There's only one big MLG left this season anyways, so I guess that's *okay*.

It's also come to our attention that possibly the best way to do this would be to get a Vandy student or teacher to check out some sort of media room on campus for us to use. We'd have full access to TV, sound, internet, and since Vandy's not a dry campus: BYOB. Please speak up if you have this kind of access...

Failing that, we've got multiple options on places in town to start reaching out to. The limiting factor there is simply numbers. If we say 25 people are coming out and 5 people show, it's gonna be awkward. Once we know what consistent numbers we can bring, it will be easier to set up a consistent place to have this with a room we know will hold us all. Until then, we've kinda got to take it week by week on locations...

I've set up this facebook group to start getting an idea of how many people would show up on what night of the week. I can make FB events for the MLG and any other Saturday thing we can get enough people for. The basic idea is to do a week night either weekly or bi-weekly, and a Saturday either monthly or bi-monthly. Go here to vote on what weeknight would work best for you:

http://www.facebook.com/groups/235981499792761/

There's a preliminary Google calendar linked up there as well that we'll compile all the SC2 events onto for planning purposes and put all our meetups on. I'm updating the side-bar with links. It's m-f-ing ON, guys.

I'm on careerbuilder, monster, dice, follow CL.. and nothing. I'm told my resume is good but maybe it's too good. I apply for tech support and training jobs based on my past experience and am at a loss as to why I don't get responses. Maybe it's too good for entry level and not good enough for management, I don't know.

I'm currently struggling with a job at Home Depot that I've been at for a year, (responsible and dedicated employee). I'm keeping my bills paid but if not for my lovely wife, I would be starving, (family man).

I would like to ask any redditors about any positions that you know about that may be under the radar that I can apply for. Also, if there are any resume professionals out there, maybe you could look at mine and tell me if I'm doing something wrong or can make it better.

I was hoping for this weekend since the 13th is my birthday and this seems a great way to celebrate... however, I am forced to share this day with mothers nationwide and realize sacrifices must be made.  

So perhaps a medieval-style Reddit meet-up for the weekend of the 19th or 20th?  As I look at the website, it says it's Pirate Weekend.  Or even the next weekend, which is Jousting Weekend.  I think we could make this epic, guys.  A Medieval Meet-up.  Tell me what you think.


**EDIT:** *As of May 12th.*  Okay, so looking over all of these posts, this weekend seems to be unpopular (due to celebrating mothers instead of the coming of Yours Truly).  If any of ya'll are still reading this, it's looking like the 19th and 20th are going to be the best bet for a meet-up.  I'm favoring the 20th personally (since I just looked at my work schedule and realized I'm closing on Saturday), but we'll see how this pans out in the feedback.  Let me know what works for you guys! 

**UPDATE AS OF 5/18:**  Okay, so I haven't really heard too much from people in either thread, but hopefully this will work out.  Consider this thing on for Sunday at noon.  I'm going to be there and hopefully not walking around [alone.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/619/Untitled-1.jpg)  I'll wait somewhere around the ticket booth for 15-20 minutes wearing my stunningly awesome emerald green ball-cap (the most stand-out-in-that-kind-of-a-crowd thing I can think of right now).  So if you're going earlier or coming later, just look for the chick in the green cap.  After that it's fun and games and drinking.  And pirates.

Meetup Attempt(s) #2, I want to be voted on by you guys so the most possible people can make it out at the same time. I'm listing all the Trivia Time nights/places below - everyone loves trivia, right? ;) 

http://www.myspace.com/triviatime

Please, only vote up the ones you would actually go out to if they're made ""official""; we might easily get more than one meetup out of this... Feel free to add anything you guys want.

I've only been out to a few different places that do this, and it varies wildly as to how popular/crowded each night is, usually. I've gone into 3crow Thursday :30 minutes early several times over the summer and not been able to get a table at all, for example... Let us know if you have any inside info like that.

Thanks! Hope to see you fine folks soon. :D

-----
**WINNER** - it seems that tuesday night at corner pub is winning hands down, so i'm going to go ahead and make it ""official"". hope to see you all there! only one person besides me from meetup1 is going to be able to make it, but the consensus is that they'd like us to look at continuing this same trivia night weekly so they can meet people later. i think it's a great idea!

Notes: our group will be clearly marked, so **look for the upvote arrows** and you'll be able to easily recognize us. ;) if you're bringing more than one friend, please try to let me know ahead of time so I know how many tables to squat.

Just got off my lazy ass to start running and such again.  So that said, I'm looking for an additional motivator and to have some fun.  My experience with the rec leagues include a season of kickball with NSL, 3 seasons of indoor soccer with Williamson County, and 1 outdoor with NSL.  I also played soccer in elementary, middle and high school, but no one gives a fuck about that so I'll move on to the next point.  :)

I'm not great at basketball or baseball, but would entertain the idea.  

Also really enjoy ultimate frisbee.

So my question to you all would be if any of you would be interested in forming a quasi-competitive team and if so, what sport?

I come to the table with two others who would be down for most anything so the r/Nashville team already has 3 members.

If this is a terrible idea, please feel free to also downvote appropriately.

*Edit 1:  To be honest, I thought I was going to have trouble filling a kickball team, but learned that you all like roller-hockey.  Awesome.  If we have enough to fill a team, lets roll with that.  Justinnnn, I'll message you about the league.  

I think I'd like to be sure we're clear that all skill levels are welcome, so as to try to include any interested.  That said - If you do have interest and haven't played or are 30 years old and out of shape, but want to come out, we'll see if we can get some practices and such to try to get you up to speed before we go and compete to any degree.

**For the Ultimate Frisbee people** - I used to have a group that would play pickup games in the evenings on Sunday at Centennial, but participation waned and we stopped.  If you all want me to try to get those folks back together (and with your email/contact info) maybe we can start that up.  If things progress and we want to compete, we could look into move_damnit's suggestion.  Again, all skill levels welcomed.

I'll see if I can get both going.  If you can PM me directly, I can start building those lists.  If you'll put which sport in your subject, that will help me sort you goobers out.

My suggestions, for what it's worth:

1) A complete overhaul of the FAQ page. Right now it's very utilitarian and not very user-friendly or easy to understand (case in point, the Move to/Avoid section). Better yet, don't refer to it as a FAQ, call it something along the lines of ""/r/nashville suggests"" or whatever.

2) Create a poll, using the existing suggestions for things to do, and rank everything in all categories by number of votes. Make it clear that the suggestions and rankings were a poll of users of this subreddit.

Anyone can Google the chamber of commerce, tourism websites, etc.. but I think the reason people ask is because they want personal advice from like-minded fellow redditors. Simply linking them to generic tourism websites, like so many city subbreddits do, is not sufficient.

3) Expand on the ""places to live"" section. Just listing neighborhoods is pointless. Vandy/Green Hills/East Nasty/Franklin are nice in their own right, but wildly different types of places.

4) Prominently link to the FAQ at the top of the page.",,False,self,t5_2qimh,False,,,True,t3_11hgs6,http://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/11hgs6/real_faq_suggestions/,

This is our last chance to defeat this ridiculous bill!!

Even if his secretary tells you that he's in a meeting, leave a message urging him to veto the bill. His secretary will tally up how many people called and complained.

EDIT: I forgot to mention we have until the end of next week (May 11) to convince the governor to veto. The bill was passed on May 1 and TN gives 10 days (not including Sundays) for the governor to veto.

Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
 
As you know, Belmont University played a key role in the last presidential election by hosting the 2008 Town Hall Presidential Debate. One of the University’s primary goals in hosting that event was to offer educational programming for our students and the Nashville community and to make Belmont the place where everyone could gather to discuss policy issues impacting our nation. Belmont’s commitment to that goal has not changed, and we wish to continue these efforts during the 2012 campaign. Several weeks ago candidates were notified regarding the availability of Belmont facilities as a gathering site to make Middle Tennesseans aware of important issues in this race prior to the Super Tuesday primaries. Belmont University does not support or oppose candidates for public office.
 
**Late this afternoon the Rick Santorum campaign confirmed their intent to use the Curb Event Center tomorrow night (Wednesday, Feb. 29) for a public forum. This event, which begins at 8 p.m., is not a political fundraiser. It is free and open to the public as well as the entire campus community, and doors will open at 7 p.m. Please be advised that parking and traffic will likely be impacted by this event. Students with evening classes may wish to arrive early and park in the North Garage beneath Inman/McWhorter.**

My team Ball Me Maybe will be playing our last game this Thursday, and with the closing of the spring kickball season comes the opening of summer dodgeball. Some of my team won't be playing dodgeball, so now it's time to recruit some new players, but most importantly some new friends!

You do not need to be a certain size, shape, age, race, or gender to play dodgeball, you just need to be ready to have some fun. It costs $70 per person to play, but that includes pre, mid, and post season parties, your league t-shirt, 8 games of dodgeball madness including playoffs and theme nights, plus the opportunity to get off of reddit and meet some new people! Games are at 7 o'clock every Monday night from June 10th to July 29th, and are played at the Gordon Jewish Community Center in Bellevue.

Here's some more information:

There is a shared bathroom and fully furnished kitchen and common areas.

Back yard is gigantic. There's a wood deck and covered parking as well. 

The house is walking distance from Nashville West, and conveniently located on the Hillwood/West Meade side of Charlotte Pike- the nice part ;-)

I have a dog, and he is awesome. He's a Great Dane/black lab mix- he doesn't chew stuff up, pee/poop inside or hump things.

Ideal candidate would be college student working part-time or recent college grad working full-time. Anybody with a desire to actually accomplish something in their life-time.

If you're a devout (insert any religion here), wear Ed Hardy, listen to 103.3 FM, plan on voting for Romney, or watch Fox ""News"", we would probably not be a great match as room mates.

We're trying to see if we can find a subletter, but we're not even sure if they'll let us.

They enjoyed making up things on the fly and were all friends in the kingdom of Nashville. 
In 2012 they all got together and made two solemn vows. First they vowed to make 2012 the best year for improv comedy ere' seen. Ah but what makes the best they wondered? So they asked the people of the kingdon (and are still asking by the way)
Secondly they vowed to make things even better for their kind patrons who would offer the time and laughter as gifts to the troupe, because that is a rare and special thing. 
The gifts offered by the troupe to the patrons? Bigger shows, new directors, more classes, brand new games, shows every 1st &amp; 3rd weekend of the month, a sign leading the way to where the performances were. (Sir Dan Johnson stepped in and filled the role of sign &amp; now stands daily marking the entrance to the theater) 
And most recently, credit cards can now be used instead of bags of gold and silver for admission at the door. No longer will anyone be turned away due to a lack of paper. 
Because they take their vows seriously they have and will be spending their days and nights living up to their vows. 
This story isn't over yet.

First, her sister lives just up the road in Bowling Green, KY and is going to say she ""won"" a manicure/maybe a day at a salon, depending on price. Any places you might recommend over others? I've looked around a bit and there are all kinds in town, it seems.

Second, suggestions on a location. She loves broadway/downtown and thinks the skyline is beautiful as well. I know there's the pedestrian bridge over the river that offers a seemingly good view of the skyline. Am I correct in thinking this? Similarly, are there any problems with homeless or beggars on the bridge? (Just want to make sure). 

Finally, I'm wanting to look into a photographer because she has hinted how much she loves having them around. This isn't a necessity by any means, but tif the price is right I would love to have it. Anybody know any reasonable and potentially available photographers? I would probably be fine with an amateur as long as I saw a work sample.

I've visited the Game Keep and the Nerdery, and they've got a pretty cool vibe.  Good people.  Tabletops are awesome, but I really love arcades (or better yet, tabletops PLUS arcades).  Anyone have any suggestions?  I've heard of Game Galaxy, but honestly I've heard less-than-great things about it, so I'm wondering if there are any hidden treasures out there that anyone knows about.
