Just one brother helping out another, but a bond was made that I don't think I'll get from a stranger ever again. Here's my story.

So it was Thursday night and I was at Alt-J with my two friends and my girlfriend. I was a bit dehydrated and a little burnt out.

I started feeling a little woozy and I broke out into a cold sweat (never a good sign). Suddenly My face went super cold and I fell HARD, hitting my nose on someones shoulder on the way down. My girlfriend said my face was white, like all the life drained from my body. I was taking really shallow breaths, so this was a bad situation.

So I was out cold for a solid 20 seconds at this point. One friend went to get a medic while my buddy and my girlfriend tried to get me up to no avail. My girlfriend (god bless her) shouted desperately for help.

Suddenly this guy comes out from the crowd and grabs my hand. He jerked me up to my feet (I weigh 170, he did this all on his own - incredible). He then grabbed the back of my head and shouted ""Wake up, brother!"" and my eyes opened very faintly. He squeezed my hand, put his other hand on my chest and said ""Look at me! You're right here brother, you're good. Just breathe, drink some water you'll be fine"" and I snapped right out of it.

In that moment, we had a bond that can't be broken. I feel like we actually are brothers. I don't know anything about him, but I feel like I know exactly who he is from that moment alone. It was a dire situation, and he genuinely wanted to help me out. I never got his name, but I gave him a huge hug and a thank you before leaving the crowd. I could tell he felt that bond too, we shared a spiritual moment. He was just getting me back to real life, and was willing to do just about anything to keep me on my feet.

If you had the patience to read this, please upvote on the off chance that he reads this post. I would like to get in contact with this guy. This moment changed my life, I have a new outlook on people now. We're all brothers and sisters, and I'm going to treat them all accordingly. Thanks Bonnaroo, I love you and I'll see you next year.

For those of you that don't remember, this was the product of this subreddit's collective knowledge**

**Edit #2** I also had a Bonnaroo Beginner's Thread that people enjoyed. If this is your first rodeo, check this out for tips too: http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/18x0z0/beginners_this_is_what_you_need_to_know/



Here are the tips, advice, and information your fellow Bonnaroovians think may make your time even better...

**Food and Water**

1. Get dry ice. Wrap it in a towel, cover it with ice or frozen water bottles and this will help keep food and water cold/frozen all weekend.

2. Bring double the water you need, in the form of bottles. Freeze these ahead of time so that you don't have to buy the expensive ice at Roo. Also use this to keep food cold. Combine with dry ice for maximum results.

3. Buy a camelback. Check woot, they apparently have a sale every couple weeks. Or just check [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3400551). At least get the sac and keep it in a backpack. This is worth the investment. **Name-brand worth the extra $$ here, as off-brand may cause plastic tasting water**

4. Bring real food. Use the above methods to keep it frozen. Eat this the first couple days to ensure it doesn't go bad. Cook it on...

5. A grill. Again, worth the time/investment to get one. You can save the money on food alone if your thrifty.

6. Bring a lot of snacks to. Even if you don't eat it all, you can share. The healthier the better, to keep you energized and increase endurance. Bars like Clifbar are great choices: Nutritious, delicious, and easy for on-the go.

7. Make yourself eat breakfast. As in food, not just coffee and a donut. Even if you don't feel like it, this will help your body begin to get ready for the day. If you start your metabolism early, you'll have energy early and late.

8. The 'Jesus Tent' is a good place to check out for breakfast. Free water, fruit, snacks, and coffee. While you're there, they have free phone chargers you can use. 

9. Get the Fish Tacos. Just do it. And the nearby lemonade. Be warned, they sell out as soon as they are ready and you may have to wait.

**Campsite**

10. Get a flag or balloon and fly it above your tent. 

11. The sun is going to bake your tent very early. Get a silver tarp, or something likewise large and reflective, and set it up blocking the morning sun from making it to your tent. You may buy yourself a few extra hours of sleep. Warning: Not too close, it will create a pocket of hot air above your tent and you'll still bake. **Mylar blanket/sheet works much better than a tarp for this purpose, but may be noisy if you aren't careful.**

12. Bring a collapsable water container for free easy showers. Fill this with free water at night, place it on your car, and the morning sun will warm the water to comfortable temperatures. Wake up and feel refreshed!

13. Have some sort of shade structure. Eazy-up canopies seem to be popular, but if you don't have the money, others recommend building something with PVC pipe and hanging tarps, blankets, sheets, etc.

14. Have a battery operated fan, and ideally a water sprayer as well to keep cool.

15. ""Unpack quickly. While you want to be neighborly, space is at premium. Make sure you spread out as much as is decent so that you can maximize your chilling space.""

16. Have one of he following three: An air mattress, a camping pad, or a inflatable pool raft. You will sleep much better.

17. Have some sort of pee bottle. Its gross, but much more convenient than making the walk to the johns at 4 AM when you wanna catch as much sleep as possible.

18. Earplugs may make it much easier to sleep some nights due to late night shows you may not want to see, or grab a nap during the day.

19. Have towels. You don't know what you may need them for.

20. Have a mallet for staking things in the ground.

21. Do not forget your chairs. Bring one extra for the one that will break. 

22. Have a safe to lock valuables up, also locked away inside the car. Its 99% friendly on the farm, don't give the others the opportunity to ruin your experience.

**Clothing**

19. Footwear is important. Do not rely on flipflops. In fact, leave them at the campsite. Have a reliable pair of sandals that stay on your feet. Have shoes for if blisters occur. Also, bandaids for covering the blisters. 

20. You know to bring cool stuff, but bring warm stuff as well. It can feel pretty chilly at night time, it can't hurt to bring a hoody and sweatpants.

21. Underwear, underwear, underwear.

22. Bring a bandana! Or a hat. Or both...

23. Sunglasses are also a good idea...

**First-Aid/Health Items**

1. Sunscreen. Use this excessively. Bring extra.

2. Any toiletries you want to use or normally use. 

3. A tub to soak your feet in with some epson salt may help reduce soreness and increase stamina for the next day.

4. Alcohol Wipes/ **Baby Wipes** are a good idea. Sanitize your privates, Roo bathrooms can get dirty.

5. Babypowder for your thighs. Chafing may attack at anytime. And remember, prevention beats treatment.

**Misc, but Equally Important Tips**

1. Have a headlamp.

2. Beware of cops on the way down and the way home. The closer you are to Bonnaroo, the more there will be.

3. Fill your tank within 20 miles of Bonnaroo. You need the gas for waiting in the line, and it can serve as an easy way to get into air-conditioning while at the campsite.

4. Facing the main stage, start at the back and work your way left. People flock from the other stages and tents and fill it up from the right side in...

5. Cinema tent = Air conditioning and some unexpectedly good flicks 

6. Know how badly you want to see comedians. The line can get pretty long because so many people want to go. Last year Aziz was worth it. It all depends on your interests, but don't expect it to be quick.

7. Check out new things. New people, new performers, new genres, new food, new anything. Bonnaroo has so much to offer. Experience as much as possible.

8. Bring extra toilet paper.

9. Go to the bathroom at the gas station you stop at before going in. You will wait in line. 

10. Have extra lighters.

11. Don't think Thursday and Sunday aren't worth it. Come as early as you can, leave as late as you can.

12. Bring toys, games, and other things to entertain yourself during down time. Glow sticks, a deck of cards, a frisbee, etc...

13. Explore! This lets you find new things and get better acquainted with Bonnaroo. The more you explore, the less you will get lost.

14. There are other entrances besides the main gate. If the line is really long, you may want to check these out. 

15. Hug the people in the free hug shirts.

16. If there is any chance you may try a drug for the first time (be realistic with yourself going in) then read up on it before hand. Know what you are getting into and don't freak out.

17. Share with your neighbors. 

18. Ask and you shall receive. ",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,1368067563.0,,,True,t3_1dxlgw,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1dxlgw/the_50_bonnaroo_pro_tips_i_compiled_2_months_ago/,

I found it easier than ever to communicate with all of you. Everyone came in all shapes in sizes, but you all had your own stories. It was weird being in a place, where everyone was there to generally enjoy themselves, for a several day span. This trip opened my eyes for me. The music. The people. The farm. 

My friends ended up being a bit of a wet blanket for me, so I went to a few shows myself and some with the neighbors. It was a great experience from dancing with you at the sunrise of Pretty Lights to falling asleep together in the back of Empire of the Sun. New friends came and went, but maybe its better that way.

On Sunday night, after Tom Petty, I was sitting under my canopy looking in the sky at the passing Chinese laterns. I felt so comfortable I was confused. I had barely slept in 4 days, haven't showered in a week, my diet was nothing compared to normal, more than usual use of drugs and alcohol, I had to travel back home on an 10 hour drive in just a few hours, I had major catching up to do on school and work. In that time though none of that was on my mind. I just kept looking at the Chinese laterns amazed thinking that someone else out there is looking at the same latern, maybe having the same feeling.

2- Thanks for making me feel welcome even though we didn't totally feel like we fit in the mix. We are career software people and this was a weekend far far away from our lives and families. You all made us feel like part of things and that was huge. You approached us and shared with us and we are grateful.

3- I have been to maybe 40+ concerts in my life and this was by far the best sound I've ever heard at a concert ever. And it was so consistent too!

If I could do it all over again I wouldn't change a single second of it. From the moment I stepped on the farm to the last set I watched. I was expecting a good time, but what I experienced was beyond my wildest dreams. It honestly changed me. The random acts of kindness from strangers and all the high fives I gave out and received made it so much better. I was planning on visiting a different music fest every summer for the next couple years, but now my mind set has changed. I just want to go back to Bonnaroo every year and hang out with the coolest motherfuckers on the planet while listening to great music. Thanks everyone that I met for the amazing time and see you all next year!

Cops will be looking for reasons to pull you over! Avoid the following easy to remember things:

* **Obstructed view:** make sure you can see out your back window!

* **Riding too close on someone:** make sure the person in front of you has plenty of room.

* **Not using turning signals to shift lanes:** use them blinkers!

* **Littering!:** We're supposed to be green anyway, right? Don't throw stuff out of your window! Keep a bag in your car. 
&gt; **ALSO KNOW THAT THROWING A CIGARETTE BUTT OUT OF THE WINDOW IS CONSIDERED LITTERING IN TN, AND THROWING A LIT CIGARETTE BUTT OUT OF THE WINDOW CAN BE CONSIDERED THROWING A DANGEROUS OBJECT OUT OF A MOVING VEHICLE.** (consulted with a police officer on this one, he said if he's really searching for something to pull someone over for, that's usually an easy one)

* **SEATBELTS!:** Buckle up.

* **Make sure all blinkers, headlights &amp; taillights are working.**

* **KEEP YOUR SPEED DOWN!:** Theyre lowering speeds all through TN! Keep an eye on your speed and don't go over!

* **If you pass a car (especially a semi), don't merge until there's plenty of room between you and the car.**

* **Avoid passing too many people altogether:** Just goooo with the floooow man.

* **WRITING ON YOUR WINDOWS:** Bonnaroo bound all over your windows is just asking to get pulled over!

* **Have your co-pilot man your cell phone!:** Avoid having it in your hand at all. The naughty texts can wait, and your copilot can handle the rest! No copilot? Use hands free options on your phone or leave it alone.

* **Wear some plain clothes on the way up:** Your awesome, colourful, spiffy, scant festival wear is awesome at roo, but try to wear some normal garb on the way up. The loud clothing is a cop magnet.

* **Keep your eye on the road!:** Have a passenger grab the next CD or the cell phone you dropped in the floor. Taking your eyes off the road for one moment can cause you to swerve.

Also remember to keep an updated insurance card and registration in your car. Don't forget your ID! MAKE SURE YOUR VEHICLE REGISTRATION IS UP TO DATE. If it's not, stop by your DMV. If you can't, take another car. This is a freebie for the cops to pull you over.

**Know your rights.** You don't have to consent to a search, unless they have probable cause to search you. The magic words ""Am I free to go?"" are your best way out. If you get pulled over &amp; have to do this, DOUBLE WATCH YOURSELF THE REST OF THE WAY TO ROO. You'll have a giant target on your back as you'll look suspicious, even if all you wanted was to get on your way to get in line for roo.

**When you get to Roo, make sure you pull off to the side of the road in the line. Don't block the right lane.** Cops were apparently being really strict about this last year!

**Download the app WAZE!** It's a social GPS where lots of Roogoers (including my crew) will be reporting cops &amp; speed traps in real time! Make sure your copilot handles this as well. ;)

**If you like to, *ahem*, *smooooke* in your car, try to avoid it on the way to roo.** If you DO get pulled over, the second they smell anything, they'll have probable cause to search your vehicle.

1331923717.0,70,self.bonnaroo,qzqmh,Your Guide to Drugs at Roo,84,14,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/qzqmh/your_guide_to_drugs_at_roo/,"There has been at least 2-3 posts per day regarding drugs at Bonnaroo and I expect it to increase as we get closer and closer to the festival.  I'll be a four year vet to Roo, and I've seen and partaken in my fair share of extracurricular activities at all.

**Getting to Bonnaroo**

Let's start with getting there.  I wouldn't recommend bringing anything with you when you go.  Why bring sand to the beach?  If you're bringing to sell then you should already know the risks.  Talking about how to get things in over a public forum is a bad idea. 

A) You're labeling yourself as a dealer online and I'm going to wager it's not the best idea.  B) You're making the tips and tricks of getting things into festivals more widely known and thus less useful.  

The only tip I'll give you if you're bringing things in, is look like young professionals. Collared short sleeve shirt, a clean car with no NORML bumper stickers, and nicely trimmed hair will help.  Looking like a dirty hippy is going to raise red flags.



**Getting Your Goodies**

So you've gotten into the festival and not been arrested. Congrats!  Now set up your camp very quickly and decide one of two routes.  If you're there early then dealers will be walking around camps.  Wednesday night until Thursday at about 5 or 6 pm is when the dealers are most mobile. Sit in your camp, crack a few beers and enjoy yourself.  The drugs will come to you.  If it's later just go walk around the camps asking for things.  


Some things are more common and festival appropriate to ask for than others, but we'll talk about those later.  There are undercover cops, but they're going after dealers and pushers.  Asking someone for pot is not going to get you arrested, I promise.  

Protip: Don't be fucked up while you're looking for drugs.  It's easy to be taken advantage of or with pupils the size of saucers ask a policeman if he knows where some molly can be found.  Keep everything you get either on your person or in your locked car, Bonnaroo is 98% GGG's, but it only takes 1 SS to ruin your day.

**Particular Drugs**

I wouldn't recommend trying anything you're not familiar with at Bonnaroo, it's just asking for a bad time.  I'll make an exception for pot as it's comparable to alcohol. That being said be careful regardless.  It's easy to get swept up in the excitement and try something that your might not be ready for.

**Dosages**

If you intend on buying anything it makes sense to have a scale with you.  Not getting ripped off is a plus, but making sure you don't take 300mgs of Molly is even better.

**Pot**

It's everywhere, maybe more common on the farm than music is.  Generally speaking everyone is going to be saying they have headies, prices will be $50-$70 an eighth.  Go around and ask for it.  It's expected and all but ignored on the farm.  I sparked at joint in the front of the pit for Robert Plant last year, security looked at me, laughed, and gave me a little nod.  Virtually nobody there cares if you smoke at any point in time.  Don't bring your own glass piece as it WILL be taken if they find it at the check, bring rolling papers and buy a $10 one hitter when you get there.

**MDMA**

Don't buy ecstasy pills please.  I'm not talking to the responsible reader who has their own testing kit, but the shit that's in some of those pills can RUIN your late night.  Get pure MDMA (Molly) if you're looking to roll for a show.  It has become very common on the farm as they've increased the late night EDM shows.  It's ~$100-$150 for a g which is plenty for you and two friends for two nights.  It's not a drug I'd suggest you take for the fisrt time at Roo, but not bottom of that list either.

If you're going to take it know the following.  A) Bring gum, your teeth and jaws will thank you.  B) Add an *additional* two bottles of water per show minimum.  This is very serious, it's hot on the farm, molly will dehydrate you, you will be dancing, you will be sweating.  Please don't be stupid, this is the number one cause of shitty times at Bonnaroo.  You already should be drinking 10+ bottles of water per day, so what's 4 more?

**LSD**

It's much more common on the early days than the later ones to stock up.  Roughly $10 per hit from what I've seen, but I've heard anywhere from $5 to $20.  While LSD is a ton of fun if you're experienced, Roo is not the place for your first acid trip.  There's a lot going on and it's not uncommon for people to freak out on acid, especially in a setting with 100,000 people.  There is bunk acid at Roo just like any other festival.  Being a good judge of character is really your only hope for avoiding bad acid 100% of the time.  As with Molly I'd suggest increasing your water intake.

**Shrooms**

They come in to forms generally, plain old shrooms in a bag, or chocolates.  As with bunk acid, there are bunk chocolates so be careful who you buy from.  Prices on shrooms are much higher at the festival than I've ever seen outside of it at $40-60 an eighth.  As with anything, increase water intake and don't do it if you're not experienced.  Shrooms has a lower freak out rate, but a higher feeling ill rate.  Perfect ways to ruin an evening if you don't know what you're dealing with.  As with acid, it's most common on Thursday and Friday and more difficult to acquire on Saturday or Sunday.

**DMT**

DMT will be there, but is relatively rare. $10 a hit.  Not a whole lot to say because it's so short lived.  Do it in your campsite underneath a bowl.  Hit it like keef.  

**Others**

I'm not experienced with anything else really.  I know opium and cocaine are there in smaller amounts, as well as the 2C's.  I would exercise extreme caution with these and avoid anything you're not 100% familiar with.  The above should be MORE than enough to have a drug filled religious Bonnaroo if you see fit.

**Closing Thoughts**

Please be smart. Here are a few basic rules I have always followed at Roo in regards to such things.

1. Don't bring anything with you.
2. Drink more water if you take anything.
3. Don't take anything you're not experienced and/or very familiar with.
4. Don't get so fucked up you can't enjoy the music.
5. Have a buddy to do things with, it's way less scary and way more fun if you're with a friend.
6. Don't feel pressured to do something every night or even at all, the music is incredible regardless or your state of mind (as long as you avoid Neon Trees)

Check out http://www.erowid.org/ for all the information you need on any given drug you are thinking about trying.  The more literature you read on the subject, the better position you are in to make an informed decision when you don't have a computer handy.

If you have specific questions I haven't answered feel free to send me a PM and I'll do my best to help.  Good vibes and I hope that you all have a fantastic Bonnaroo, I'll be sure to see you at the meetup should you choose to come!

I made it when avoiding work... enjoy.",73,4,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1fs7v9/seriously_though_biggest_bring_to_bonnaroo_list_i/,"This was written for a trip with two people, girl and guy. This what we bring... you might have some changes. But we keep getting more 'My first Roo!!' posts. So shhh, this is a great set of guidelines. Make changes where necessary. 

In our Bonnaroo box we have the following:



*General (100% necessary/experience changing are bolded):*

- **WRISTBANDS**

- Multi-tool/Pocket Knife

- String 

- Twine 

- Duct Tape 

- A Tarp (ESPECIALLY IF YOUR TENT LACKS A FOOTPRINT) 

- **Cooler**

- **Sunscreen** 

- SPF Lip Balm 

- SPF Face Stick 

- Baby Wipes 
 
- Gold bond body powder (for women it’s to prevent chafing on the thighs, for men it would be to keep the boys comfortable and dry haha) 

- Hand Sanitizer 

- Spray bottles (they do wonders to keep you cool) 

- Camelbak 

- **Toilet Paper** 

- Paper towels 

- Ziplock bags for open food items 

- Small bottles of Shampoo and Conditioner (just in case. If you pay for a shower they provide these) 

- Towels 

- Extra tent stakes 

- cheap solar garden lights (not necessary but nice) 

- Headlamps 

- **Ear plugs (we only use them for sleeping, they’ve worked wonders)**

- Camping sleep pads (roll up, air inflating) 

- 1 sleeping bag 

- 1 sheet 

- Tent fan (not necessary but nice) 

- Mylar blanket to lay over the tent and keep the sun reflecting off 

- Tapestry (good for shade&amp;seating) 

- Folding chairs 

- **Tent** 

- **Easy-Up**

- Glowsticks!!!

- Giant Frisbee

- Ponchos

- Rain boots



*Food/Beverages (No glass containers are allowed!!):*

- Water (we bring ~3 cases) 

- Gatorade (electrolytes and all) 

- Java Monsters, 4 a person (energy drinks to keep us going on the late nights, plus the coffee goes well w our whipped vodka) 

- Beer 

- Pinnacle Whipped Vodka (a handle) (this brand because the handle is plastic) 

- Some people like some soda 

- Clif Bars 

- Cheese its 

- Goldfish 

And whatever food appeals to us in the store. Lots of people prefer to pack in food- whatever floats your boat. We enjoy eating throughout the fest, and you can do it for reasonable prices.



*Clothing (Men) (this is a general idea of what my boyfriend brings. he goes barefoot throughout the day, that's why there's no real shoes)*

- 2 Pairs of shorts 

- 1 Bathing Suit 

- A few Tshirts, but he generally doesn’t wear them. You may burn easier and want them, I don’t know. 

- Extra boxers, because you might use a pair during the day, and want a fresh pair before you go out in the evening 

- Extra socks if you are bringing close toed shoes 

- Flip flops for around camp 

- Vibrams for at night 

- **Bandanas (I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH)** you’ll probably want 2-3. They are useful for keeping sun off of your head and neck, and block dust from your nose and mouth. Wetting them helps keep you cool immensely. 

- He also owns a buff (which is awesome too) 

- Costumes! Optional, obviously 

- You may want a hat 

- One sweatshirt 

- One pair of long pants (sweatpants, jeans, whatever)



*Clothing (Women) This is a general idea of what I bring:*

- Several bikinis (I wear these all day. I don’t have to worry about getting wet in the fountain or mist tent and it’s generally more comfortable to sweat in them haha) 

- Two pairs of shorts (I don’t usually end up wearing these whole lot, when they get wet they chafe with all of the walking you do 

- Long skirt (I love it) 

- Dresses (I bring several, they’re really convenient) 

- Short linen skirt 

- Several tanks/tshirts 

- One pair of pants 

- One sweatshirt 

- Underwear 

- Bras 

- This year I am bringing biker shorts to wear under dresses, I don’t know if I’ll like them

- Two pairs of flip flops in case one breaks 

- Sanuks for at night 

- Socks for after I baby wipe my feet clean and get into the tent 

- Bandannas, like I said for my boyfriend. I also have a buff. 

Typically I go with a bathing suit and a short skirt/dress during the day, and switch to a long skirt and underwear at night. It feels good to change into clean things and the sun is down so a long skirt is comfortable. The sweatshirt I sometimes use at night.




*Toiletries that I bring as a woman:*

- Detangler 

- Makeup remover 

- Face Paint 

- GoGirl (because spot-a-pots are gross. You can get them at target) 

- A razor, because I don’t like prickles 

- Lotion 

- Lots of hair ties



*Tips (Misc. There have been plenty of 'tip' threads, but I find a few of these to be quite valuable):* 

- Get the port potties right after they are cleaned. They will be nicer, albeit wet (they clean them with hoses) 

- Covered port-a-potties in centeroo will be less muggy during the day -Chill out in the am to save energy for the evening 

- Make friends with your neighbors! 

- Have your pocket contents in your hands and raised when they do the pat down at the gate to centeroo. Makes life easier 

- Don’t sit against the wall surrounding centeroo, for the most part. People pee on it in the evening and when in lines to get in… 

- Check out the shops! Some of them are really awesome and the vendors are amazingly nice. They have great stories if you hit them in the evening 

- Frozen lemonade is huge, and cools you down a lot 

- If you get lost, flag down a Mountie (security on horseback) They’ll get you home with little to say 

- Drink/Do drugs at night… the heat is not something to mess with 

- Make a rendezvous point with your friends to that if you get separated during a show, you know where to find one another





**HAPPY ROOING!** (6 days till the fest, 4 days until I leave :))

But regardless I still need to share this: 
I talked to a girl right before Empire of the Sun started, and I must have said like two things before she motioned for me to get closer so she could say something. I leaned in and she said ""Do you like my lips."" It takes me a second to process the implication, because it's too good to be true. I didn't know her name, and I talked to her for 12 seconds. So I just said ""uhhhhhh...yeah."" Boom, right there she and I went for impassioned kissing right on the spot in two parts over the next 5 minutes. It was magical. Ecstasy. Happiness. She then crowdsurfed afterwords and I never saw her again.

If you are actually reading this: thank you. For my 18 years of living I've gone from being beyond nervous around girls to being simply OK. But that was the first time a girl truly showed affection towards me. I used to think no girls ever saw ANYTHING in me. But she saw something in me. She might have been tripping (actually, I feel 90% confident she was on something), but she still saw something, I am certain without a doubt. And ever sense, I've walked with more confidence, my happiness is beyond measure...I've honestly never felt happier. My anxiety is gone. Any girl I can talk to now. The world is mine.
I couldn't make this shit up, it was too amazing to lie about. It was the greatest moment of my life. So to you, girl with the phenomenal tongue: thank you for making me happy.",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,False,,roo-flair,True,t3_1gms6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1gms6l/to_the_girl_during_empire_of_the_sun_who_explored/,

Post any thing you've learned to do to make Bonnaroo more enjoyable here.

u/sirhobotooth offered this great advice that prompted this thread: 

Want a free ""almost"" shower every morning? Pick up one of those collapsible 5 gal water containers with a spigot, fill it up with free water and let it sit on the roof of your car. When you wake up in the morning it will be very warm water and refreshing... I've even managed to wash my hair this way.

I'll add another tip here as well: 

Those toilet seats can get extremely gross. You can grab an extremely cheap toilet seat for very cheap at a dollar store or something like that, take it with you, keep it at camp, and use it when you go near your camp...

Additions:

u/kmentropy brought up a great point about being a good neighbor. Let me add to this and say for anyone prone to feeling awkward meeting new people, talk to your neighbors right away. When you start unpacking and setting up camp, strike up a conversation. Offer a helping hand. The longer you wait, the more likely you'll begin to 'feel' too awkward to just walk up. Do it when everyones wrapped up in the excitement of just getting there and help people set up camp. You'll be guaranteed friends for the entire weekend.

And now myself, and my production company [Human Being](http://humanbeingmedia.com) are creating a sequel this year. 

Also we are creating a separate film for Bonnaroo that is completely crowd sourced. We are looking for any footage and photos you shoot this year, to make in to a Bonnaroo fan collaborative video. So Send us your youtube links at trueroo@bonnaroo.com or drop it on our facebook wall (below). For photos use #TRUEROO on instagram

And look for us this year, we will be cruising around all day with 5D's asking people to smile and to high five! 

The videos will be up on our [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/humanbeingmedia) once completed. So check back there. 

Or keep up with us on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/humanbeingmedia), and meet us at our camp!

Last year, I went with my boyfriend at the time (who I met right here  r/bonnaroo) and some of his friends. It was awesome, don't get me wrong, but I'm a Jesus girl, and the whole drinking/drug thing isn't really for me so I definitely wasted a lot of the experience being intoxicated; which IS the experience for a lot of folks, just not for me.. Anyway, this year, I plan on going lone wolf style, with a theme and all. I feel goofy for admitting this, but I feel like you guys are like super loving distant family or something so I'll tell ya. I'm a delivery driver and just spent the last 8 hours in a car dreaming about all the ways I want to help people at Roo this year. I go for the music of course, but this year I'm putting an equal emphasis on people. I want to bake a thousand cookies and pass them out, I want to piggyback obliterated girls back to their tents, I want to fill hearts with warm smiles, the way the music fills my soul, and the way Bonnaroo brings out the greatest qualities in each individual. I want to relieve the dehydrated with water, and I want to turn all the frowns upside-down. To me, I have seen the power of love work it's hardest when I am living my life for Jesus, and when I am spending a few days of the year at the farm :) I'm going to try to find a wolf head/jacket like the bear suit in Workaholics. If I succeed in finding one, come find me and say hi, and I'll give you a cookie baked with all the love in my heart :) 
I hope you didn't get stuck in my pool of sappiness,  but so excited to see all of your beautiful faces this year! Let's let the flame of love ignite bigger than ever this year!

As a big Walk the Moon fan, I've been following what they plan on doing at Roo, and when they tweeted that they were excited about the Kalidescope Space Tribe set, I decided to check them out in hopes I'd run into WTM at the set.

Google searches led me [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=kalidescope+space+tribe&amp;oq=kalidescope+space+tribe&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j0j62.4054&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8): A bunch of fan run WTM blogs.

I found this odd, so I found the [twitter](https://twitter.com/kspacetribe) that WTM was tweeting at (@KSpaceTribe). It's odd that this band only has 40+ followers and 20 tweets, isn't it? Well look at the [picture](http://imgur.com/giy9zsI). After looking deeper and deeper, I realized that this is just a distorted negative picture of Walk the Moon, more specifically, [this picture](http://imgur.com/aaxUwde).

After seeing all this, and some of KST's replies to people on twitter, I feel that it's almost definite that Walk the Moon will be playing a second, ""surprise"" show on the Sonic Stage.

Walk the Moon played Sonic Stage back in 2011 and have talked about how awesome it was, so it doesn't seem that crazy that they'd come back and play it. Plus many other artists play a second set/do interviews at the Sonic Stage, so this may not be a stretch.",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,False,,roo-flair,True,t3_1g38ta,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1g38ta/walk_the_moon_will_be_performing_a_surprise_set/,

I am only 20 years old and I grew up loving the Beatles. I was the typical 14 year old kid who just hit puberty with long hair who had 20 different Beatle's shirts. Being able to see a freaking Beatle perform live was amazing. The whole set I was blown away and I cried multiple times. (John Lennon tribute, blackbird, the second he walked on stage, hey jude, etc.) When the ""na-na-na's"" started it was the first time in life I have been brought to tears simply out of pure euphoric joy.

His show is something I will tell my future kids about and my grandchildren. Just the fact that he can play songs that he wrote in the 60's and have thousands of people my age recognize and sing along to blows me away. Whatever your opinion about him is, recognize that you got to see the most successful recording artist of all time play an amazing set.

I was talking with someone next to me before a show this year, who made a joke about how if Bonnaroo was held in the early sixties, none of the hipsters of that era would have wanted the Beatles to have played because they would have been seen as a mainstream boy band.  He thought it was funny and interesting how music and taste in it changes over the years, as the huge show of the weekend was Paul.

I joked that N'SYNC would have been boo'ed out of all of Tennessee if they had been on the lineup in 2002 when it first started, but I thought that Timberlake possibly might even be a welcome addition to the lineup if that were to happen today.

What would you guys think if he actually were added?  Would you be excited to see him, or would you just bemoan it as another factor in the ""mainstream-ification"" of Bonnaroo?",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,False,,roo-flair,True,t3_1hbwfj,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1hbwfj/would_you_like_to_see_justin_timberlake_at/,

1371428362.0,48,self.bonnaroo,1ghfjw,Roo Review From a First Timer!,59,11,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1ghfjw/roo_review_from_a_first_timer/,"My wife and I had to leave a bit early today because of work first thing tomorrow, but we just got home from our first Bonnaroo and had the time of our lives.  I have to be honest and confess that I was very hesitant before we left, as I'd heard horror stories about the heat, theft, and other potentially problematic issues, but we really ran into no big problems at all and had an amazing time.  

I did have a few quick thoughts on what I did enjoy and what I do think could be improved upon, and I wanted to share my thoughts with what seems to be a veteran community here.

Loved:

-The vibe!  Absolutely everyone I talked to was interested in meeting new people and were glad to make friends and get to know one another.  I made a lot of great new connections from people all over the country, and very much felt like I was a welcome part of a big community over the past weekend.

-Staffing / security: Aside from one unfortunate omission, absolutely everyone that I encountered with security or with a Bonnaroo shirt on was entirely upbeat, helpful, welcoming, etc.  I really felt cared for my entire time there and felt as if I was in a safe environment.  Even the mounted security were extremely pleasant and compromised and worked with my wife and I when we were having difficulty getting our truck out of the roadway for our spot.

-I was also really happy with the sound on the main stages.  We could hear bands clearly when we were far away, and didn't have our ears busted when we were on the rails.  I'd read complaints in the past about sound for the main acts, but I have no complaints, I thought it was great.

-Prices for concessions / dinner: I was also pleasantly surprised with how relatively inexpensive most things were.  They were higher than they'd normally be in the ""real world,"" but there was a lot of great food at somewhat reasonable prices, considering that they were being sold to a captive audience within a high-priced festival.  It was also really delicious, Jim and Nick's BBQ was my favorite!

-Bonnaroo ""magic.""  I don't know if it's a typical experience or if I was just really lucky, but so many great things continually happened for my wife and myself during our entire stay.  We got a great camping spot just a ten minute walk away from the entrance, got a spot on the rail behind the pit for McCartney after waiting only four hours, and even got to meet The Lumineers after we went to the Ed Helms comedy show.  I'd read from some attendees that this kind of ""magic"" happens, but I wasn't really planning on having as much good fortune.  I'm a believer now!

Didn't Like:

-I ran the Roo Run 5K Saturday morning, and it was kind of a joke.  It started 20 minutes late and seemed to not be professionally organized at all.  No timer markers, understaffed water stations, and there was a lot of miscommunication beforehand about many of the details that still were never fully explained on site.

-I'm also not a huge fan of those who somewhat inconsiderately put out blankets or lie down so close to what clearly are standing only areas.  It makes it incredibly difficult to navigate around without stepping on someone, I don't know how I made it through the weekend without accidentally stepping on someone's face.

-The pit line for the Lumineers that my wife and I waited four hours for was a real mess.  About half of the line cut in front of about 100+ people, causing a really contentious situation that very nearly became very violent with a lot of pushing and shoving.  Once security came in, they did their best to professionally sort it out, but still had to rely on baseless and largely inconclusive he said, she said information to conclude who cut and who didn't.  From what I saw, the pit lines seemed to be very poorly organized in general.  I'm not sure why they don't just hand out numbered tickets in a way similar to the way the Comedy Tent is handled.

-I know it's luck of the draw, but we saw firsthand how we could have easily had our weekend ruined by having our camp put next to a bank of portapotties or a generator / light at the corner of a street.  We were lucky to have the spot we did, but we would have been absolutely miserable if we had drawn the short straw and gotten into one of those kinds of spots, nevermind a spot far away from an entrance.

-I also wasn't entirely happy with how the Mumford / Jack Johnson situation played out, but I realize it's partially out of control.  It seemed to me that since Bonnaroo knew almost a week ahead of time, they could have booked a name on similar footing and a closer genre as Mumford without having to evidently beg Jack Johnson at the last minute when he happened to be sitting in with friends of another band.  I was really, really looking forward to seeing Mumford and I'm still bummed out about it, but not too badly since nothing could have been done anyways.

In summary, I really thought a week or two ago that I'd be one and done with Bonnaroo and would have been happy to at least have gone once.  But now I'm already looking forward to my next one and can't wait to go back.  Thanks everyone for being a part of the time of my life!",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,False,,roo-flair,True,t3_1ghfjw,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1ghfjw/roo_review_from_a_first_timer/,

I don't think I need to say that things have been dicey lately in the great US of A. 

With that in mind, I encourage everyone to keep an eye out for anything suspicious.

Security will be tighter this year, with the focus on explosive materials, but they can only do so much. As Boston has proven, a determined mind will find a way. 

I challenge you, fellow redditer, to add your eyes to those of security's. If it doesn't look right, then it probably isn't. Don't be afraid to report something that is out of place. It is better to be safe than sorry. They are few, and we are many. 

All I am asking is that you be aware of your surroundings. You don't have to be paranoid and afraid, just aware. 

I refuse to let that fear dictate my actions. I will be having a fantastic weekend and am looking forward to some artists I've never seen. I will not let my family and friends fret over my safety should they suddenly see Bonnaroo in the headlines. I've enjoyed this festival for many years, and I have no plans to stop any time soon. 

I wish you all a great weekend! If you happen to see the Blackhawks flag in the back of the Walmart, stop and say hi!

 We'd had all of three close personal interactions prior to discussing Bonnaroo plans. I'd always been quite smitten. But in 2010 a very close old friend of mine and his girlfriend, who was good friends with the girl that would become my fiance, were talking in January about getting VIP tickets to Bonnaroo. 

 Well, they contacted me on chat about getting tickets too. I said that it looked expensive, and wasn't sure I could get the time off work,  hadn't even looked at the lineup yet, etc. Then she mentioned that Susan needed a ticket buddy. 


 I said, and I quote, ""you had me at 'Susan needs a ticket buddy'.

&gt;My Story:
&gt;
&gt;During Radiohead in 2012, I was with a group of 6 people trying to huddle for space up close. At one point, I had decided it would be a great idea to take of my sneakers to feel the nice grass on my tired feet.  Well, **I WAS WRONG.** Not 5 minutes later, Radiohead has taken stage and the crowd rushes forward. I looked back and realized I had lost one of my shoes.....
&gt;    
&gt; Walking back to my campground shoeless was a nightmare, and with 2 days left of 'roo and no spare shoes, I thought I was done for. I ended up finding a single ""Marvin the Martian"" flip flop in my size (mens 13) on the ground in BFE, and decided that it was destiny. Not wanting to spend &gt;$40 on a new pair knowing they would be ruined at the show, I toughed it out and was walking around with 1 shoe and 1 sandal.
&gt;    
&gt; Fast forward to Sunday afternoon, my friends and I had started to wander over to the Phish set when low and behold, what did I find? No it wasn't my shoe, but the matching Marvin the Martian Flip Flop! At this point I wasn't even phased by the fact that I was wearing a random persons' sandals, I ended up just switching out my remaining shoe for the flip flop and went off to dance my ass off for Phish!
&gt;    
&gt;**TL;DR**  It's a metaphor dummy, I may have lost a shoe, but I gained a sandal

I'll be the first to tell you there were no drugs on the farm, but on the *off chance* that y'all were saucer-eyed, deliriously happy and dance-obsessed because of consuming little (...or a lot) of MDMA, consider looking into 5-HTP.

Here's one good write up, but there are a lot around: http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1dyckl/mdmamda_supplementation/

tl;dr is that MDMA use can disrupt your brain's serotonin levels as well as ability to restore those levels. 5-HTP, a dietary supplement that can be bought at many places like CVS or Walgreens in the U.S., is a precursor to serotonin which bypasses a pathway potentially disrupted by MDMA (ab)use. Taking it post-roll can hasten getting your brain back to normal.

**Food and Water**

1. Get dry ice. Wrap it in a towel, cover it with ice or frozen water bottles and this will help keep food and water cold/frozen all weekend.

2. Bring double the water you need, in the form of bottles. Freeze these ahead of time so that you don't have to buy the expensive ice at Roo. Also use this to keep food cold. Combine with dry ice for maximum results.

3. Buy a camelback. Check woot, they apparently have a sale every couple weeks. Or just check [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3400551). At least get the sac and keep it in a backpack. This is worth the investment.

4. Bring real food. Use the above methods to keep it frozen. Eat this the first couple days to ensure it doesn't go bad. Cook it on...

5. A grill. Again, worth the time/investment to get one. You can save the money on food alone if your thrifty.

6. Bring a lot of snacks to. Even if you don't eat it all, you can share. The healthier the better, to keep you energized and increase endurance. Bars like Clifbar are great choices: Nutritious, delicious, and easy for on-the go.

7. Make yourself eat breakfast. As in food, not just coffee and a donut. Even if you don't feel like it, this will help your body begin to get ready for the day. If you start your metabolism early, you'll have energy early and late.

8. The 'Jesus Tent' is a good place to check out for breakfast. Free water, fruit, snacks, and coffee. While you're there, they have free phone chargers you can use. 

9. Get the Fish Tacos. Just do it. And the nearby lemonade. Be warned, they sell out as soon as they are ready and you may have to wait.

**Campsite**

10. Get a flag or balloon and fly it above your tent. 

11. The sun is going to bake your tent very early. Get a silver tarp, or something likewise large and reflective, and set it up blocking the morning sun from making it to your tent. You may buy yourself a few extra hours of sleep. Warning: Not too close, it will create a pocket of hot air above your tent and you'll still bake.

12. Bring a collapsable water container for free easy showers. Fill this with free water at night, place it on your car, and the morning sun will warm the water to comfortable temperatures. Wake up and feel refreshed!

13. Have some sort of shade structure. Eazy-up canopies seem to be popular, but if you don't have the money, others recommend building something with PVC pipe and hanging tarps, blankets, sheets, etc.

14. Have a battery operated fan, and ideally a water sprayer as well to keep cool.

15. ""Unpack quickly. While you want to be neighborly, space is at premium. Make sure you spread out as much as is decent so that you can maximize your chilling space.""

16. Have one of he following three: An air mattress, a camping pad, or a inflatable pool raft. You will sleep much better.

17. Have some sort of pee bottle. Its gross, but much more convenient than making the walk to the johns at 4 AM when you wanna catch as much sleep as possible.

18. Earplugs may make it much easier to sleep some nights due to late night shows you may not want to see, or grab a nap during the day.

19. Have towels. You don't know what you may need them for.

20. Have a mallet for staking things in the ground.

21. Do not forget your chairs. Bring one extra for the one that will break. 

22. Have a safe to lock valuables up, also locked away inside the car. Its 99% friendly on the farm, don't give the others the opportunity to ruin your experience.

**Clothing**

19. Footwear is important. Do not rely on flipflops. In fact, leave them at the campsite. Have a reliable pair of sandals that stay on your feet. Have shoes for if blisters occur. Also, bandaids for covering the blisters. 

20. You know to bring cool stuff, but bring warm stuff as well. It can feel pretty chilly at night time, it can't hurt to bring a hoody and sweatpants.

21. Underwear, underwear, underwear.

22. Bring a bandana! Or a hat. Or both...

23. Sunglasses are also a good idea...

**First-Aid/Health Items**

1. Sunscreen. Use this excessively. Bring extra.

2. Any toiletries you want to use or normally use. 

3. A tub to soak your feet in with some epson salt may help reduce soreness and increase stamina for the next day.

4. Alcohol Wipes are a good idea. Sanitize your privates, Roo bathrooms can get dirty.

5. Babypowder for your thighs. Chafing may attack at anytime. And remember, prevention beats treatment.

**Misc, but Equally Important Tips**

1. Have a headlamp.

2. Beware of cops on the way down and the way home. The closer you are to Bonnaroo, the more there will be.

3. Fill your tank within 20 miles of Bonnaroo. You need the gas for waiting in the line, and it can serve as an easy way to get into air-conditioning while at the campsite.

4. Facing the main stage, start at the back and work your way left. People flock from the other stages and tents and fill it up from the right side in...

5. Cinema tent = Air conditioning and some unexpectedly good flicks 

6. Know how badly you want to see comedians. The line can get pretty long because so many people want to go. Last year Aziz was worth it. It all depends on your interests, but don't expect it to be quick.

7. Check out new things. New people, new performers, new genres, new food, new anything. Bonnaroo as so much to offer. Experience as much as possible.

8. Bring extra toilet paper.

9. Go to the bathroom at the gas station you stop at before going in. You will wait in line. 

10. Have extra lighters.

11. Don't think Thursday and Sunday aren't worth it. Come as early as you can, leave as late as you can.

12. Bring toys, games, and other things to entertain yourself during down time. Glow sticks, a deck of cards, a frisbee, etc...

13. Explore! This lets you find new things and get better acquainted with Bonnaroo. The more you explore, the less you will get lost.

14. There are other entrances besides the main gate. If the line is really long, you may want to check these out. 

15. Hug the people in the free hug shirts.

16. If there is any chance you may try a drug for the first time (be realistic with yourself going in) then read up on it before hand. Know what you are getting into and don't freak out.

17. Share with your neighbors. 

18. Ask and you shall receive. ",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,1361548428.0,,,True,t3_1905wc,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1905wc/here_they_are_50_bonnaroo_pro_tips_for_your_added/,

To say I was excited would be an understatement. About a year ago I moved to away leaving behind all my friends and family. Coming to Tennessee with all of my former roommates and another of my really good friends was honestly what I was most excited for. 

Thursday night, after going hard at The Other Tent all night we decide to walk over to This Tent to catch Alt-J, who I've never listened to despite all of my friends telling me how great they are. We decided to hang back and chill on those blue picnic tables instead of going into the crowd, and that's when it happens...

It was close to the end of their set, everything was covered in dew, chilly but not cold. Sitting there with my best friends who I hadn't seen in months but acted as is if nothing had ever changed. I didn't know it at the time but Alt-J was playing their song ""Taro"". Since I had never heard their music and I was in such a state of happiness, I was only half listening. The song became background music, a theme in a movie to me. I will forever remember that moment and how perfect it seemed to me. While I had many awesome moments at Bonnaroo that will stick with me for a long time, the simplicity and happiness I experience during that set, and that song, with those friends, in that place gives me chills thinking about.

Move over law - if there is a vehicle pulled over on the right side of the road, you are to move over to the left lane. If you are unable to move over, decrease speed greatly. (see comment on above article)

TN made a great deal of [money](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M2ndwlmBOY&amp;feature=youtu.be) last year.

On Hwy 111, speed limits change from 70 mph &gt; 65 &gt; 45 and then up to 55. You will want to do the speed limit. 


It is simple to bypass Hwy 111. Go through town (take 289, right on Bockman Way, left on Mayberry/Hwy 1) but do, please, study a map before attempting this.

That person for me was my really cute Canadian camping neighbor. She was really cool and interesting, and I thought we got along really well.  For half the weekend I contemplated asking her for her Facebook name, but decided against it because I thought it might be torturous to try to stay in contact with someone I'll probably never see again since she lives near Toronto and I North Carolina.  However, as soon as we said our goodbyes I immediately regretted not getting some sort of contact info, or at least a last name. 

I will probably never see her again, but not getting any info almost guarantees it. Even if we both go next year, there are so many people that the chances are we won't run into each other without discussing it beforehand.

Edit 1: Thank you everyone that has helped so far. I'm going to keep ever artist to just one album unless they (like Jim James and Paul McCartney) were/are also members of other bands of note. If you wish to check out other good albums by artists, the comment section would be a good place to look as these are fellow Bonnaroovians and therefore may have a similar taste.

Edit 2: I may have bitten a little more of than I could chew hah. I'm glad everyone is helping me out with this list.

I got to the gate and my car randomly selected for search by the state troopers. My heart sank. My license was suspended at the time for unpaid traffic tickets. Thankfully I had no drugs on me. My only passenger was a 16 year old kid I was ""keeping an eye on"" for his parents benefit.

One of the troopers asked for my ID I gave him my passport card. Its the only ID I have since my license was confiscated. The trooper got angry and demanded to see my drivers license. I told him I didn't have it and he asked if it was suspended or revoked. I was honest and said it was suspended and gave him the Number to run it.(cops usually appreciate it if you have the License number memorized if you don't have it, it makes it easier to look you up.) He asked if I had any warrants and ran off to his car to look me up.

Another trooper was searching my car and found a shit ton of alcohol. Two handles of Vodka and to 24 packs of beer. he came up to me and said, ""Now I know your going to claim this but your buddy here is 16 I know its not all for you. I gotta take this."" Now being without a license I was already subject to arrest so I just complied. I said. ""I understand officer do whatever you need to do."" I saw him put it all in the back of his car.

The trooper running my ID came back, and talked to me and my friend. he said, ""I could arrest you right now but I see where you've been making payments on you fines so I'm going to let you go. Be careful when you leave here, all troopers ain't as nice as me."" then he drew a star on my windshield and we got back in line. 

I get to the campsite and we start unloading the car. I open the trunk and right on top is all my beer and Vodka! At some point one of the troopers must have sneakily put it back into my car! Those troopers were awesome.

Tl;dr: awesome troopers didn't arrest me. they took my alcohol and then slipped it back into my car when I wasn't looking",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,False,,roo-flair,True,t3_163fwe,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/163fwe/did_anyone_else_run_into_these_awesome_troopers/,

I used to be extremely over weight. I wish I had some before and after pictures to show you but I never allowed my picture to be taken when I was fat. During my 4th year I had got sunburnt pretty bad on the backs of my arms on thursday afternoon. Figured I applied the sunblock everywhere, I couldn't reach back there. This made the rest of my weekend so uncomfortable.  I decided that I was going to spend the rest of the year loosing weight. I lost over 40lbs. I went to bonnaroo this year and was able to take my shirt off. I wasn't worried about my body and sunblock was applied effortlessly. I saved about $70 because I was eating less crap and I was enjoying my self, I wasn't dying of heat. I even got to dance with some ladies.

For the big Rooers out there, You can do it too!! Now is the time, dont wait. This can be your Bonnaroo resolution. Gyms get crazy busy after the new year, get in the groove now and beat the rush. YOU WILL FEEL AWESOME.

I think it may have just been the heat making everyone keep more to themselves.

This year though....was so different. I have never felt so welcomed and loved by everyone around me. 

Were there any special moments to you this year caused by the environment and people around you?

I found a purse during Radiohead. There didn't seem to be anyone around me whatsoever so it would have been easy to just take it, claim it, and steal all of the money and credit cards in it. The people I was with were even encouraging me to. 

I would have felt too bad though. I had nothing but love for me in my heart from how amazing and welcoming everyone was all festival long. Instead, I went through it looking for an ID or something helpful. I found a container of bubbles inside, some money, cards, a really nice phone, and so on. 

I thought about taking everything for myself, but realized that I couldn't do it. Instead, I composed a long note to the owner of the purse about finding their purse, not taking anything, but keeping the bubbles. I had this long plan to take the purse home with me, find the owner on facebook since they had an ID inside, and mailing it to them.

Let's face it: the lost-and-found at the festival isn't that great. I had little-to-no hopes of the owner ever getting her shit back through it. 

I took out the bubbles and started blowing them hoping someone around me would be like ""shit man, bubbles. I have some of those!"" and it actually worked. The woman whose purse I had found found me right away.

It felt good handing it back to her, though I feel like she thought I was trying to keep her stuff for myself. 

Regardless, I feel good. Did anyone else have any similar experiences where they've surprised themself like this? ",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,False,,,True,t3_v56k7,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/v56k7/roo_really_does_change_you_for_the_better/,

1371704122.0,35,self.bonnaroo,1gpj9o,My First Bonnaroo Experience (and Thank You to Sir Paul McCartney),37,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1gpj9o/my_first_bonnaroo_experience_and_thank_you_to_sir/,"Going into Bonnaroo, I was nervous, and I was a little sad that everyone came in such big groups and had all their amazing camp set-ups with cool flags, while I was all alone and had nothing but two lawn chairs(I slept in my car the entire weekend). I had come to Bonnaroo because I knew it was something that was going to help me. I had recently stopped talking to someone I was really involved with for over a year(it ended badly), and on top of that, my Aunt Lynn had recently passed away. I was very close to her, so it really rocked my world in a terrible way. I didn't know why, but I just felt like Bonnaroo was what was going to fix it all. It wasn't until Friday night, that I witnessed Paul McCartney's set that everything changed for me, not just on my Bonnaroo experience, but my life in general.

&gt; Before I go any further, let me start by saying that growing up, **I never listened to The Beatles.** I was raised largely in part by my elders; my grandfather, a Vietnam war vet who was a strictly country music person, and my great-grandmother, who probably to this day doesn't know who The Beatles are. My parents themselves are not big Beatles listeners either, so long story short, I just never had an outlet or connection to them like most people probably had growing up, so I never had the chance to become a fan.

&gt;In fact, the only Beatles song I ever liked was Here Comes The Sun, and I heard that my first time only a few years ago(I've recently turned 20). Not sure why. So Friday night, was my first time hearing a lot of Beatles songs, specifically *Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da*, *Blackbird*, *All Together Now*, and of course first time hearing Paul's Wings and solo stuff like *Here Today*. 


Before Paul's set, I gulped down my water I had mixed with molly. It kicked in around Midnight Special, and I remember just having so much fun dancing with the people around me, and just so happy to be around so many beautiful, happy people. A really nice girl I met looked at my face and told me I was crying, and I replied ""I am?"", and lo and behold, I check and I'm actually crying tears. I was crying because I was so happy. She was nice enough to wipe my tears away for me.


Now, it wasn't until Blackbird and Here Today that those happy tears turned into something else. I wasn't dancing anymore. I was frozen, mesmerized, and listening to every word Paul was singing. ""You were only waiting for this moment to be free"" was what really hit me, and I could just feel all the sadness and weight I had been carrying(pun very intended) over me for the past year just evaporate. When he followed up with ""Here Today"", and started talking about John, I already knew what kind of song it would be. The entire time, I just thought of my Aunt Lynn, and all the things I wished I would have said to her, and what I would say to her if she were still here. 


""Live and Let Die"" was the moment where I felt like an entirely new person. I finally felt free, like a new person. The rest of the weekend went amazing. It felt so great to feel legitimately happy finally. It got a bit overwhelming for Bjork and David Byrne &amp; St. Vincent, and I cried during those too, but only because I just could not comprehend that I was actually at Bonnaroo after SO many years of wanting to go ever since I was in high school, and actually seeing Bjork and St. Vincent, two people I thought I'd never really get to see. 


I had an amazing first Bonnaroo. I don't want to know where I would be right now if I had not went, and not seen Paul McCartney's set. He really turned things around for me and touched me with his set. Hope I get to see him again one day. This weekend was the best weekend of my life. Thanks to all of you who went and helped to create such an amazing environment.

1361402388.0,34,self.bonnaroo,18x0z0,"Beginners, This Is What You Need To Know...",37,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/18x0z0/beginners_this_is_what_you_need_to_know/,"So Bonnaroo is something that you can't quite understand until you have experienced it, but here is my best attempt to fully prepare you for the things you may not account for in preparing:

**Getting there**

There are tens of thousands of people attempting to get in to the farm at the same time. There are lines, and you will have to wait. But you also have to get to a line. I went early Wednesday last year, and all the exits off the highway were already shut down because there were too many people already waiting for gates to open. This will vary depending on when you arrive, but bring a map or GPS of the area. It will greatly help with confusion.

**Lines and Car Checks** 

Again, expect to wait in line. Don't worry, its worth it. As you probably know, there are car searches. These greatly vary in intensity though. The vast, vast majority of the searches are conducted by Bonnaroo volunteers. If you know the rules going in, know how much alcohol you are allowed to have, know not to have glass bottles, and more obvious rules, you likely can get through with little to no trouble at all. Again, the majority of searches are quick, and not very invasive, with quick checks of coolers and whatnot, BUT...

There are random searches done by state cops. These are VERY invasive. You don't want this done, regardless of if you decide to break the rules or not. They take a long time, and you have to repack EVERYTHING. I've never experienced this. I've heard estimates that they check maybe 1 in 100, maybe even less. There are no official figures on this that I know of. 

I know many of you are wondering, can I sneak in 'goodies'. All I can say is know the risks. If you are caught, you risk heavy fines, not being permitted into Bonnaroo, and possibly even worse punishments. It depends on what you have and how much. Anything you want will be inside. People get it in and if you ask fellow Rooers, most will at least point you in the right direction. That being said, it is possible. This point is up to you. I'll repeat, know the risks, plan accordingly.

**Once You're In**

If you are General Admission, you aren't going to get to pick your spot. There will be volunteers 'ushering' you in lines so that they can efficiently fill the spaces available. Last year they had spots pre-marked. There is enough room for you to have your car, a tent, and a canopy. Thats really it, unless you get lucky. Don't expect sprawling amounts of space. You'll be right up against other Rooers, but don't worry, everyone is friendly. 

Other options are group camping, VIP, and tent city. These are fairly obvious, except tent city. Tent City is an area very close to Centeroo where you can camp, but only with your tent. You park your car and take your gear down, expect a hike...

**Now What?**

These are the best tips I can give you regarding once you are in the farm:

1. **Know where your spot is.** Triangulate with 'landmarks' around your area, other tents and camps, the floating numbers (Bonnaroo has camping divided into Pods that are marked with floating numbered orbs in the sky) and bathroom rows. It can get very hard to find your spot at night...

2. You may have heard, Bonnaroo is a marathon not a sprint. You need to **pace yourself**. You will do a lot of walking. Some camps can be a mile from the stages. And its hot. Really, really hot...which brings me too

3. **You can't really sleep in**. When the sun comes up, the inside of your tent becomes a sauna. But its cool at night, you're gonna fall asleep under blankets/in a sleeping bag. You will wake up between 7 and 9 drenched in sweat. I can almost guarantee this... Which is why...

4. You need **water!** Lots and lots of water. Be safe. Get a 24 pack of bottles per person. Who cares if you don't drink it all, you have it if you need it. And if you can, take a **camelback**. This will greatly help with always having **water** to drink, monitoring intake, and not having to carry lots of bottles around.

5. Also, **BRING FOOD**. Many people think, ah I'll just buy it there. I strongly advise you to pack some food that is easy to heat up and make, or just eat quick. Clifbars are great, healthy, give you energy, and easy to grab and go, or pack and eat later. I always take a grill and pack a cooler with food to cook. I'm the one relaxing with a full, delicious meal while the others don't eat so they can save money for later...

6. Related to food, the bathrooms are a crap-shoot... hehe. But yea, you'll never know how they will be, and sometimes you can't walk anymore to get to one. Oh, and it can't hurt to take some **extra toilet paper** with you. Keep it at your camp, and late at night if you have to go, take it with you. That way if the johns near you are out, you can use them while everyone else goes searching.

7. There are lots of vendors throughout the camping area and Centeroo. You can get all sorts of cool things, although they cut down on the unlicensed selling which is a shame, but what are you going to do...You can still get anything from food to art to clothing to pipes. Yes, lots and lots of pipes. Cheaper than you'll find anywhere else, too. 

8. **Sunscreen.** Don't be that guy that turns into a strawberry. The sun can ruin your time very quickly. Take precautions.

9. If you find a section of time with no acts you want to see, **check out the comedy and cinema tents.** They are air-conditioned and even if you just sleep for a couple hours it can recharge your battery. But there is also some really rewarding things you may stumble upon. I saw a great documentary that I would have never chosen to see while at Bonnaroo on accident, but I'm happy it happened.

10. **Expand your horizons.** Bonnaroo has a lot to offer. Check out performers you don't know, talk to people, and experience new things. Its awesome.

**What To Bring**
* Tent
* Tarps
* Canopy (optional)
* Air Mattress (optional)
* Coolers
* Water
* Food and Quick Snacks
* Pots, pans, utensils and a grill if you can
* Camelback
* Backpack
* Extra Underwear
* Babypowder for possible chafing
* Bandaids for foot blisters
* Extra shoes, socks, and sandals
* Cool Clothes
* Spray bottles (spray yourself to cool down)
* Camera
* Map
* Sunglasses
* Hat
* Sunscreen
* Extra key for car to hide
* Flag (for above tent for easy location)
* Toilet Paper
* Lawn chairs and a folding table
* Small safe for hiding valuables in car
* A belt

One last thing: **on the way home, the roads throughout Tennessee are oozing cops.** They look for out of state license plates and check cars, regardless of reasons. Be careful driving home...

The girl next to us asks him to describe the phone.  After the wasted dude successfully ID'd the phone, the girl gave it back to him and told him that she had found it on the ground, called the contact ""Mom"", explained that she had found the phone on the ground at Bonnaroo, got the dudes dorm address and had planned to send it to him in the mail when she got home.

Needless to say, the wasted dude was super grateful and I think said something funny along the lines of, ""You didn't tell my Mom I was tripping, did you?"", and then did some ridiculous dance move as ""payment"" and walked off.

We are pooling resources, so you will have a pretty sick camp site complete with camping showers, grills, plenty of EZups, hammocks, and more.  The group is a pretty awesome mix of Redditors everywhere from Massachusetts to California, Michigan to Texas to Guam.  We have plenty of solo-ers, and people who are willing to carpool if you're looking for people to ride with.  You will need to sign up (buy your Bonnaroo Ticket, and pay your Groop Camp invoice) by this Friday the 13th if you're interested.  If you need more time to consider just let me know.  If you (and your group) are down to join us, PM me.  See you on the farm!

Edit:  **It's too late to join**, but feel free to come hang out at our after party Thursday night, or potluck on Saturday morning.

Me: bipolar, suicidal, lost father at 13, mother emotionally absent from my life growing up, friend killed himself at the start of summer, just a rough way to live.. Granted, I'm a privileged white boy living in a suburb of Houston. And now the story....
     Headed out on the 11th to drive with two buds to Nashville, where we were spending the night. These two guys want to smoke everything we have on the way and not sneak anything in... I wasn't about that, so I brought a secret stash of about a quarter ground up and 5 caps of molly, along with a big bud I brought to smoke otw. We head out, and they have 5 joints and two blunts, my bud makes 7 joints. The guy I'm with held onto it, and not going to lie, made me feel uneasy. He then decided we weren't going to smoke any of it and sneak everything in. Well, it was going smoothly until he was speeding right past Memphis. We got pulled over, asked if we had anything and my friends say no. They're state troopers ""only looking for big stuff"", they say if it's personal we'd just step on it and go. Guys still said no, and we got searched by a dog. They found the joints &amp; blunts pretty easy. Asked if there was anything else, ""no sir"". Kept searching. Took awhile, but they got my bud and molly. We're facing felony charges now. I say that stash was all mine, and for some reason the cop likes my 'honesty' even after the fact, that he lets us go. Mind you, there were 6 cops and a dog. They took our drugs, told us to ""buy them in Bonnaroo"" and we were off. The next day, we get in line for Roo at about 2, and the car dies once we start really moving. Some friendly Bonnaroovians jumped us and we got in. Once there, our car decided the alarm would go off anytime we wanted to open the doors, and later that the back door(Tahoe) would forever stay unlocked.. Had to tie that thing shut from inside. Then the start of Roo happened and everything was magic. Had such a great time that I will go back year after year for as long as I still live in the States. Then it ended, and we headed home. Cargo thing on top fell off past Tuscaloosa, and I got out to put it in the back. When I got back in, I had enough time to turn around and see before a truck came crashing into where I just was 4 seconds before. Freaking insane, and my life has never been better since the entire experience. So life changing, and even though I live with the same circumstances, my outlook is so different and I appreciate everything so much more.

TL;DR: Houston&gt;Bonnaroo, got pulled over, almost got felony, car dies, alarm everytime we unlock it, back stays unlocked, Bonnaroo was awesome, car gets totalled en route back to Houston &amp; I almost die. Entire experience so life changing and couldnt be happier now.",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,False,,roo-flair,True,t3_1jpnti,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1jpnti/the_story_of_my_first_roo_2013/,

If anyone has any ideas please post them!

Late night after Radiohead a friend couldn't sleep and walked across the campgrounds to the 2nd ferris wheel that was in the campgrounds. After arriving he 'followed the lights' to a shack that was decorated like a scene from Alice in Wonderland, and was the home of a very large man playing a Ukulele with his assistant. Cans of paint were laid in an area inside the shack that were free for anyone to freely paint the walls. He said this spectacle went on until 6 in the morning.

We took my friends his advice and followed him back the next night. We thought his story was fucked, but followed him there the next night as he was persistent that his story had no exaggerations. We followed. It was there, and it was nuts. It was basically full of other people who had ""followed the light"".

One of the greatest and unexpected experience of a fantastic festival that was not officially promoted but was there. Needless to say, this year I will also be following the lights. Doubt The Jive Joint will be there again, but no matter what happens I'm sure it'll be great experience.

Every time I speak to someone about it who had also gone, that same feeling of nostalgia just takes over me (as well as the other person). Even just now, as I was reading different threads in this subreddit, all I could think was, ""I miss Bonnaroo so much."" While I've had great concert experiences, no concert experience has ever made me feel the way Bonnaroo has felt. When my boyfriend (who went for the first time in 2011), tried to explain his feelings about it to me, I could only imagine the experience he had. And now I understand.

Bonnaroovians, if you could sum up your feelings of Bonnaroo in just a few words, what would it be? Why was/is this experience so meaningful to you?

*EDIT*

From reading everyone's comments so far, here is what I gathered, and what I initially feel as well (but couldn't put into exact words):
Bonnaroo is a happy place, and I don't mean that in like a dream-like quality. Looking back, the general feel of Bonnaroo was one of pure happiness and escapism. We all come from some sort of hardships in reality and when on the farm, those hardships are so far away and insignificant it's like they do not even exist. You're in a place where everyone is essentialy your best friend for a few days. I remember going and befriending so many people, it almost overwhelmed me. Of course, I don't remember everyone's name, but coming from Bonnaroo, I sort of expect a certain camaraderie when going back. There is no slanderous gossip, heart wrenching lies, or backstabbing. Sure you may get gipped out of some good acid or seeing a great artist, but in the end, you find some sort of peace with everything. I think instead of calling Disney World the happiest place on earth (but I still love Disney World), it should apply to Bonnaroo, at least for those who go and come back with that eternal feeling of kinship and magic that it offers. For a few days, we are all the same outcasts and misfits who walk around in barely any clothing... and no one cares. It gave me something that I seem to lack on a general basis, and that is a tight community that is free of any sort of malice or personal gain. Everyone is looking out for everyone else. Like hungrydyke said, it's what I honestly wish the world was truly like. But maybe that is why Bonnaroo is so special.",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,1355351340.0,,,True,t3_14qig5,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/14qig5/what_is_it_about_bonnaroo_that_creates_an/,

I am not going to say where, as I would like to remain anonymous, but I work in a court house in a county of TN on the way to Bonnaroo. And every year I see a tragic story unfold. 

The highway patrol targets cars with out of state tags every year before Bonnaroo hoping to find drugs. They will use any excuse to pull you over. Then they will ask if they can search your car. Many people say yes and get caught with drugs. If you get caught for simple possession of marijuana they often will tell you, you can just pay the ticket. This is not true. In the State of Tn you could be sentenced to 11months 29days in jail and a year of probation and a fine that is close to $1000. Every judge in every county will handle Bonnaroo people differently, most are quite lenient, but in my county at least, the judge makes you come to court.

We get lots of calls from people, on the day before their court date, they got stopped for simple possession and want to pay the fine. All we can tell them is that they have to be at court. Many times they will say they are out of state and can't make it. There is nothing we can do about it. If you don't go to court you may end up with a warrant out for your arrest. Talk about killing the post Bonnaroo buzz.

I am not an attorney nor am I qualified to give legal advice but I think this youtube link may help many of you next year.

I went to a local festival, it's pretty big for a local one. The headliners were Wu-Tang and David Byrne &amp; St. Vincent.

Anyway, the festival was fun and all, but the crowd was so rude and pessimistic. I mean like, worse than the employees at Pretzle Maker. If you bumped elbows with someone and said, ""oops sorry"" they were more likely to say, ""What the fuck?"" than ""You're fine"".

Maybe I sound ridiculous, but that wasn't even the worst part. My friend who went to Roo with me brought a Nic Cage totem inspired by the one at Bonnaroo. Some people came up and said they loved it but others were terrible. One guy threatened to rip it up if he didn't move. People are complaining on the festival's FB calling him a ""douchebag"" and a ""pain in the ass"". The sign wasn't even that big. Also, I was in the second row I suppose for Wu-Tang and after standing there for an hour and a half, I rest my hand on the bar because obviously my feet were starting to hurt. This middle aged couple freaks out and the guy tries to pry my hand from the bar. Then the woman bangs her elbow down on my fingers to try to get me to move. I said, ""I'm not taking your spot, my feet are just tired."" and the woman procedes to say, ""I ain't got no bar to give up."" and squeezes as close as possible to the guy next to her whom she didn't even know and then tells him about how terrible I am and how long she's been waiting there.

So the year is 2011 and it's my first trip to the Roo. My group is 3 cars deep and we are all waiting in line to get in at about 11 pm on Wednesday night. We'd been there since 7 and been moving very slowly since then. We are all stretching our legs and walking around on the side of the road for a bit when we see that cars start moving again. We all scramble for our cars and I jump in my buddy's 15 passenger, white, window-less, van that had all of the groceries we just bout at that Walmart that's close by. Keep in mind, it's only me and my buddy in the van. At the time, he was sporting a magnificent beard and long flowing hair. The dude looked just like Jerry Garcia. When we get to the front gate, a volunteer motions for us to pull over to the side where a state trooper was waiting.

The trooper tells us to get out of our vehicle. At this point I knew exactly what was happening. We got ""randomly picked"" to be searched for drugs. Now, we didn't have any on us because we weren't planning on partaking in any of the usual festival fare. So the trooper is telling us that he KNOWS we have drugs in the van and his drug dog is going to find it. At that time, another officer takes the dog to the rear of the van to search the trunk area. The whole time, the trooper kept berating my friend with questions about where the drugs were and telling him to give them up. The dog was barking and we could hear him going through the grocery bags. Finally, the dog and his handler come back around and say that they couldn't find anything. The trooper finally takes his eyes off of us for the first time and tells us to be on our way. We made it through the gate and joined up with our friends and had a great trip, but lesson learned.

Later, when we were leaving, my friend got pulled over again (this time I was in another car) for not having his headlights on (an excuse to see if he was high). So be careful going in and be sure you leave sober because the local police love to pull over Rooers.

We're just 12 days away from the best week of the year and I know everyone is extremely excited to make it down to the farm. Posts coming from the community have been extremely helpful not just to first timers, but also Roo veterans and those in-between.

Lately the amount of drug talk on r/bonnaroo has been going up. I'm not here to harsh on anyone -- what you choose to do with your body is your right and I'll defend it to the end. However, in light of events that have occurred with other festivals in recent years (read: Jam Cruise III, Wakarusa '06, and TAB playing at the Kennedy Center), other communities have cut down on the amount of talk about illicit things in order to protect the community and insure that people will still feel comfortable posting. Drug talk tends to reinforce some negative stereotypes about festival patrons that the majority of Roo'ers don't fit into, and I think it makes the community look bad. For reference, Inforoo and other forums have specifically banned it for reasons relating to the Bonnaroo name and AC/Superfly.

There are other communities where drug talk is allowed (see: r/trees, r/drugs), and they have chosen, as a group, to take that on. However, most of people I know who do festivals don't want to be associated primarily with something so generally verboten. I'm opening this up (karma-free) to elicit a discussion about how everyone else feels about it. If you think its alright, say so. Don't like it? Speak up. But I think its something that the r/bonnaroo community needs to decide on. 

NOTE: I have spoken to the Mods about this already -- we agreed that this was the best forum/way to discuss.

Thanks everybody -- see ya in 12 days.

I had lost all of my friends from my campsite early in the day so the walk back would have been pretty boring in any other circumstance, but who am I kidding this was roo.
Moments after going under the arch I was greeted by four ladies dressed as topless fairies (just wearing wings and bottoms). They had escorted me to a ""cardbord stripclub?"" Then disappeared the sign read ""show dem titays"" Normally I don't just go to cardboard jankie strip clubs but It was destiny that had brought me this far.  After what I thought was thirty mins of watching two girls ""dry"" humping each other I decided I really needed to get back to my tent. I would have made it too if it wasn't for a group of three guys looking for a fourth player for a beer pong competition. We played until the sun came up (two games).
When I finally had reached my tent my buddies had me breakfast waiting, I fell asleep mid bite just to wake up 2 hours later finish my breakfast and start another typical roo day.
TLDR: Just go to Bonnaroo!

twas the eve before Bonnaroo, and all through the house,
crunchy grooves were heard playing, like Phish and Modest Mouse

Our wristbands were registered, packed away with great care,
with hopes of lines moving quickly, and searches deemed fair

The stump of a pipe held tight by my teeth,
the smoke it encircled my head like a wreath

with bandana over my face, and my friend rockin his cap,
i pulled up the Centeroo map using my Bonnaroo App

Then over on Shakedown there arose such a clatter
a Wook selling paper with a name: The Mad Hatter

Away to the Other Tent, i came up like a flash!
though the search was ancillary, they did not find my stash

and there upon the What Stage arrose a psychedelic site
Thom Yorke wishing us a Happy Bonnaroo, and to rage all 4 nights

A few years have gone by and I've made a transition from a cold-hearted, anti-social, asshole to a peace-loving and overall caring person. 

Yet, in this society, even if you have a mindset like mine, it's hard to look forward to what interstellar and cosmic desires will add to your life. I live in an area that doesn't quite accept anything that strays from a Christian fundamentalist mindset and I'm lucky in the sense that I've found a few people that are willing to listen to me. 

Music festivals, though, give me a brief period where I can do nothing but walk on air and enjoy life as it happens. After one escape for just a few days, I can rest easily for the next several months of my life knowing that somewhere out there, I touched someone's life; maybe through enhancing an experience they were having with their own consciousness with a friendly hug and a good ol' ""I love you"" or maybe just because I took the time to sit down and smoke a bowl with them to show that someone cared, it all means the world to me.

Being in a dancing crowd makes you feel like a single wave in a giant ocean. To someone with a mindset like mine, it feels like I'm a single wave in the cosmic ocean of love and happiness.

So, we decided as a group to not bring drugs. We heard the stories and decided to just take our chances. But, as my friends picked me up, two of them decided to ignore our rule. Needless to say, we ended up going down there with an ounce of molly and a half ounce of bud. No problems on the highway, but what happens right as we enter the gate? State police search us. Better yet, shortly after beginning the search they decide to bring a drug dog over. Long story short, they somehow didn't find anything. But, newbies, take it from someone who was new last year:

You likely did not immediately notice that the battery is held in entirely by duct tape.

From reading the existing threads, it looks like meeting early at a recognizable place is best so we can get to know one another earlier rather than later. Then we can plan any later meetups if people want to get dinner, chill at camp, or other activities which are better with company.

**So, with that being said, I hereby announce the un-official reddit Bonnaroo meetup!**

**Time:** Friday at Noon

**Place:** Centeroo Fountain

**Who:** Redditors and their friends

**Look For:** People wearing Reddit t-shirts or holding up the upvote hand signal


I for one will be wearing my grey Reddit t-shirt and hand-upvoting everyone I see!


**Edit**: There is also another Reddit meetup being planned by the fine folks at redditgifts.com! They are gettin together at the first Silent Disco set with DJ Neil Armstrong. Learn more here: http://redditgifts.com/meetups/bonnnaroo-meetup/

**Edit 2:** Specifically, I will be wearing a reddit 8-bit alien shirt and an arab head scarf near the fountain. See you there!",,False,self,t5_2rg7a,True,,,True,t3_hd20f,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/hd20f/unofficial_reddit_meetup_at_bonnaroo/,

So last year my friend and I got pulled over and searched driving to the farm. We were about an hour away from the farm I believe, and we noticed we were being followed by a cop for a while. When connecting with another highway, the lights came on and we got pulled over. According to the cop we made some obscure infraction related to how we exited the highway, from what I can recall. We were searched right there on the side of the road. Nothing came of it, luckily, but I can't even remember how we consented to a search. Luckily this year we will not be carrying ANY illegal contraband with us because a friend is meeting us out there with all the party favors already.

They've been around for a few years and most Canadians know of them.  They recently traveled through my city.  They sold out two nights at one of the clubs here.  At $30 tickets, it was one of the higher priced cover charges for that club.

I saw them last summer at a festival that was also in my city.  They pretty much rocked it and were a highlight for me.  They played at the same time as John Mellencamp.  I don't regret skipping Mellencamp. :)

I'll be at their show this year at Bonnaroo.  I imagine most other Canadians that are making the trip will also check them out.

It was a rave party. I eventually started talking to this girl, while on X. Well, I ended up hanging out with her all morning. I know X is a very powerful social drug. Anyways, we traded Facebook names and we have been talking every since. Which both of us were sober by that time. Ever since I left Bonnaroo, she was in the back of my mind the whole time. We both said, while chatting on facebook that we feel like there was some kind of connection, even though we were not sober when we met. We have been chatting none stop. Our conversations have gotten pretty deep. We been talking about seeing and hanging out again. So she had the ideal to fly here from her cousin's place in NC. Stay with me a week, maybe longer. I will be working while she stays at my place and then hang out with her on my off days. I am excited about this, because I have never had something like this so random happen. I will take you back a few years to 2007 when I first went to Bonnaroo. After my first time, I have always wanted to meet a woman from there that I connect with. I feel like this could be my chance. What would you do????

**UPDATE**
Yeah.... So..... What a very interesting couple of weeks. To long of a story to get into. She is an amazing person, with an amazing personality. She is very open-minded, free spirited and intelligent. I have never in my life met a woman with the mind she has, it's like talking to myself when it comes to life in general. She also has some serious issues. She is carrying a lot of baggage, and she is out on a drinking binge now. She is a mess! Very depressed person who is running away from her problems. I wish I could help her, I wanted to help her and still do. I hate to see such an amazingly beautiful mind go to waste.  All I can do is wish the best for her. I had to get her out of my place, because I could not keep up with her, plus she would go out to the bar, hang out with random people and stay somewhere. So, it was not like I kicked her out. Lol, she did that on her own. Lucky she found a guy that works at the bar to take her in, I met the guy and hung out with him and her all night. I do believe she is at another safe place. She seems to be sinking further and further down the drain. Crazy ass 2 weeks. I am glad she was sent my way. I just wish I could do something for her to get her out of the darkness.

PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS BEFORE PARTICIPATING IN THE MAP 

When you go to mark your campsite, your pin should be placed where you camped on the farm and color coded per which toll booth you went through (ie. your pin would be red if you came in through the east Bushy branch road toll booth or perhaps YELLOW if you got on the farm from the freeway exit) and then you tag the pin with the time you got in line.

Only mark a pin for your spot at BONNAROO-2012, This is so we only have data from one year and this way it will be more accurate.

If you came in through the HIGHWAY ENTRANCE TOLLBOOTH make your marker YELLOW
If you came in through the WEST BUSHY BRANCH ROAD GATE make your marker BLUE
If You came in through the EAST BUSHY BRANCH ROAD TOLLBOOTH make your marker RED

And again, lets tag our markers with text stating the rough time that you got in line originally.


HOW TO BE ACCURATE:
Before you put a marker on the map, switch to the SATELLITE VIEW and zoom in as close as you can to make your marker more accurate.
The ADD MARKER button is underneath the SATELLITE button, Type in what time you arrived in line and then press (Choose spot on map) and click okay then click where your campsite was, AGAIN DO NOT FORGET TO COLOR COORDINATE YOUR PIN WITH THE GATE YOU ENTERED THROUGH

It's too commercialized"". First of all, you've only been a few times and have never seen it not commercialized. I first went in 2007 and it was commercial as hell then.  People will always call things commercialized but what they dont know is that this is what makes the festival possible. Ill put up with a few drunk frat boys every now and then to see the festival happen. Second of all, that doesn't make it not fun. There's no place on earth like Bonnaroo. Yes, I've been to many other festivals but I love bonnaroo and it will always have a special place in my heart. Its just so pretentious to me to think a 150,000 people at a festival are below you and its too ""commercialized"" when youve only been a few times, and it was commercialized then. Clearly they are the ones who are below being able to have a goos time without judging everything. The first time they went, they didnt care who was going or who was advertising of any of that judgemental crap because they were excited to go and experience it. And thats how everyone should be every year. If not, stay home and keep your negativity to yourself, we dont want those vibes. Im sorry, i dont usually complain like this its just that I'm so sick of pretentious elitists talking about it being ""commercialized"". It's funny because the only reason THEY ever even went or heard about it was because of how commercialized it was. WHO CARES!


Edit: as everyone is telling me, I am still going to go and have a great time and make new friends and dance. I don't usually complain but I just wanted to rant about this hipster like attitude, caring what other people do. There will be people there because of the commercialization and coming because of the lineup, but what everyone doesn't understand is that they will be far outnumbered by the 'roo veterans who come for the atmosphere, to make new friends, to listen to great music, and have an incredible weekend. No matter how commercial roo gets or people think it gets, I'll still be there, dancing around with my tits painted and having a great time.
