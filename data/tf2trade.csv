----------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have uncovered evidence of extremely dubious activity by the person who runs the widely-used TF2 Pricing Spreadsheet, at TF2Spreadsheet.blogspot. com. There's a *huge* amount of evidence which will take some time to read, unfortunately, so I'll first summarize my findings as briefly as possible and then show the evidence.

* **Case 1**. The TF2 Spreadsheet admin bought a Strange Botkiller Medi Gun for 8 keys at a time when they were trading for less than 10 keys, and he then gave this item a price of 10-16 Keys on his Spreadsheet. This unjustified new Spreadsheet price caused the market price to rise. He then sold the Medi Gun for a quick profit and adjusted the Spreadsheet price down.

* **Case 2**. The TF2 Spreadsheet admin apparently used anonymous shill accounts to attack competing spreadsheets and pricing sites, and to promote his own spreadsheet, without revealing his obvious conflict of interest.

* **Case 3**. TF2 Spreadsheet admin apparently also used the same shill accounts to inflate prices of items that he was trading and to gain exposure for his own trades.

Now I'll present evidence for all these cases. It's a *very* long read, but if you're interested in trading game items then you'll probably agree that this is important. Before you laugh at all this ridiculous drama about hats, remember that the TF2 trading economy is already worth [well over $20 million](http://theonlinesociety.com/2011/12/the-50-million-virtual-millinery/).

**Important** - A lot of the older evidence is in archived posts on the Steam Trading Forums (SPUF) at http://forums.steamgames.com. You MUST be logged into a Steam Forum account, or you will just get an error message when you try to look at those posts.

Case 1: The mysterious case of the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun
--------------------------------

My first piece of evidence is based on this trade offer at TF2outpost: http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3658466

First take a look at the item's ownership history: http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/1045336471

* STF2 and SmokedGouda001 are both accounts controlled by the TF2 Spreadsheet admin, as I will prove in Cases 2 and 3, below.

* quintosj is the totally innocent seller of the Strange Botkiller Medi gun 

Here's the sequence of events in the order that they ocurred: 

* The Spreadsheet had no prices for any botkiller items before August 19th (i.e. before the Spreadsheet Admin traded 8 keys to buy one) - These two screenshots show this:  http://i.imgur.com/TcR6V.png   and   http://i.imgur.com/K0bSt.jpg 

* At that time, the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun appeared to be trading for 10 keys or less, after the first few had sold for much higher prices. To get an idea of the market price at that time, here's a list of buyout prices for the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun from TF2OP traders during the day before the Spreadsheet first created a price for that item. You don't have to read all these, but to me, these buyout prices very clearly suggest a price range BELOW 10 keys for this item at that time. (This list shows the state of these trades 24 hours ago. It includes all trades that had a clear buyout during that period and had not been bumped when I checked them). I also have screenshots in case they are edited.


|Buyout prices of Strange Botkiller Medigun **before** Spreadsheet intervention
|:-
|[5 Keys - Sold @ Unknown price](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3650786) |
|[9 Keys - Sold @ 8 Keys](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3658466)|
|[12 keys - Sold @ Unknown price](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3644067)|
|['Some Keys' - Sold @ Unknown price](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3655155)|
|[10 Keys - Not sold](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3647708)|
|[Buds (26 Keys) - Not sold](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3650233)|
|[TS Bills (10 Keys) - Not sold](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3634070)|
|[Offer 7-10 Keys - Not sold](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3668560)|

(Don't forget that most people will accept less than their buyout price, and that the quantity of botkiller items on the market is increasing very fast, which tends to push the price down. Even at 10 Keys, most of these traders seemed unable to find a buyer, and some had cut their prices)


* At this point, with prices apparently falling below 10 keys, quintosj posts a trade, offering a strange botkiller medi gun for 9 keys, (his buyout price). Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/dJHgg.png


* The Spreadsheet Admin then uses one of his accounts, 'STF2', to buy the item from quintosj for 8 keys. Item history shows this: http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/1045336471 &lt;-- 

* http://i.imgur.com/zjEuA.png  &lt;-- Confirmation that the Strange botkiller medi gun was traded to STF2 for 8 keys, as the item history suggested.

* http://i.imgur.com/e2pXz.png  &lt;-- A new spreadsheet price of 10 -14 Keys for the Strange Botkiller Medigun is added immediately after the trade.

* After that time, if you look at TF2OP, you will see almost all buyout prices for the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun are rising above 10 Keys. Many people are asking for 14 keys or more. Why? The *obvious* answer is that people are now being influenced by the Spreadsheet's new price range of 10-14 Keys. But, as we have seen, this price range is artificial. It does not reflect the trading value of these items prior to the spreadsheet's intervention in the market - the price had clearly been falling as the supply increased, as one would expect.

* Next, the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun is passed to SmokedGouda001, one of the Spreadsheet admin's trading accounts, as the item history now shows: http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/1045336471

* SmokedGouda001 then quicksells the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun for 10 Keys: http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3687918 [(image)](http://i.imgur.com/4RkTx.png). Remember he paid only 8 keys for this, just a few hours earlier, and it's an item which is rapidly increasing in supply, which normally pushes the price down fast). Of course, it's not so hard for him to quicksell, because the Spreadsheet price is causing most other traders to ask up to 14 Keys for the same weapon.

* Finally, SmokedGouda001 sells the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun for 10 Keys, and within minutes, he changes its price on his Spreadsheet to a new, much lower, price range: 9-10 Keys [(image)](http://i.imgur.com/HRoT3.png). I was capturing regular screenshots of this activity, but you can simply refer to the history of the item, to see that it left SmokedGouda's Backpack at the same time the Spreadsheet was updated: http://backpack.tf/item/1043034684 [(pic)](http://i.imgur.com/bNmoP.png) - [(same item at TF2OP)](http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/1043034684)



TL;DR?
-----

*The guy who controls the Spreadsheet bought an item for 8 Keys, and then he immediately set the price of it on his spreadsheet to 10+ keys* and resold it for 10 keys.



*

--------------------------------

Cases 2 and 3 - Alt accounts and shill accounts
------------

The TF2 Spreadsheet admin has apparently used multiple alt accounts to attack competing pricing sites and to promote his own spreadsheet, without revealing his conflict of interest.

Evidence strongly suggests to me that the TF2 Spreadsheet admin also used shill accounts to inflate prices of items he was trading and to increase interest in his own trades.

Case 2 and 3 are closely linked, so I'll look at them together

Accounts controlled by the Spreadsheet Admin
-----------

There are **many** accounts apparently controlled by the Spreadsheet admin on various sites. Here is a list of the accounts which are important in this case. Later, I'll present evidence which shows they are all controlled by the same person.

Madking5150 / TF2S / STF2
------------------------

This account is used to handle items when the Spreadsheet has a promotional contest, and as an idle account. It is almost never used for public trading. (That trade for the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun above was a very rare exception to this). Note the avatar icon is the same as the Spreadsheet's

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037908684

[Madking Steam Forums account](http://forums.steamgames.com/forums/member.php?u=1069704). Notice that TF2S Steam account is [linked from that profile page](http://i.imgur.com/rDaVE.png)

*Note* that the Steam Forums Archives are a bit weird. You will probably need to be logged into the Steam Forums to see all the posts on these accounts

SmokedGouda001
---------------

This account is regularly used for trading. The owner appears to be making a great effort to conceal its connection to the spreadsheet.

[SmokedGouda's Steam Forums account](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/member.php?u=933713)

Prellis_V2.0
----------

'Prellis_V2.0' is a Steam Forums (SPUF) account which was apparently used for a wide variety of underhand activities in the trading sub-forum. These seem to include: posting fake bids on trades by its owner's other accounts, and attacking competitors or opponents of the Spreadsheet. Prellis never posts a link to his own Steam account. I believe this is because there is *no* Steam account, Prellis is simply an alt forum account controlled SmokedGouda/Madking.

The first thing you should know is that the Prellis_V2.0 account was very active in trading for several months, but it *never* bid on anybody else's trades, only SmokedGouda's...  you can read more below.

[Prellis_V2.0 Steam Forums account](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/member.php?u=979535)

*Note* that the Steam Forums Archives are a bit wierd. You will probably need to be logged into the Steam Forums to see all the posts on these accounts

Fact: The accounts SmokedGouda001 and 'Madking5150/STF2', are controlled by the same person
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SmokedGouda001 himself [admitted on SourceOP to controlling both accounts (where he says 'both my backpacks')](http://www.sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;p=589040#58904)[.](http://i.imgur.com/E4vn9.png) I guess this is a slip up by SmokedGouda, because this information is never repeated anywhere else (or it was edited out of other posts later).


What links these accounts to the Spreadsheet?
--------------------------------------

Firstly there is a huge amount of circumstantial evidence, which you can see below.

Secondly, the spreadsheet admin gives away some items to promote the spreadsheet. The 'Madking5150/STF2' account is used for this, and we can track these items, proving that this account is controlled by the Spreadsheet's admin, and therefore that SmokedGouda001 is also the same person.

For example, on June 19, the [Spreadsheet admin announced](http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.tw/2012_06_19_archive.html) that a Steam user called ['someonetookthenameiwanted'](http://steamcommunity.com/id/someonetookthenameiwanted) [won](http://i.imgur.com/U5CD8.png) a key from him. (That account now has the username 'Nameless', as you can see from their profile). The item history for that key shows it passing from SmokedGouda001, to STF2, to Nameless.  Here it is: http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/895088688


Anonymous promotional posts
-------------------------

In these posts, the Spreadsheet admin promotes his own spreadsheet, but gives the impression that he is not connected with it. This is maybe not the most serious of crimes, but it provides further evidence that this kind of underhand behavior is common for this person,. And it shows that these many accounts and the Spreadsheet, are controlled by the same person. There are dozens of these posts around on TF2-related sites, here are just a few of them:

[Gamefaqs](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/437678-team-fortress-2/59538786?page=4), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jsvxj/can_someone_please_tell_me_why_there_arent_any/c2exzk3)[,](http://i.imgur.com/4aPzY.png) [Reddit again](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/kc8bw/hey_can_i_ask_you_a_couple_questions_about_tf2)[,](http://i.imgur.com/bqpqf.png) [Steam Forums](http://forums.steamgames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2270365&amp;page=2)[,](http://i.imgur.com/sHaQn.png) [Facepunch](http://facepunch.com/threads/1061512), [SourceOP](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;p=658194&amp;highlight=#658194) -- note his last comment: ' this one is very good'.

Anonymously attacks competing spreadsheets and opponents of the Spreadsheet
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What happened to alternative Pricecheck sites like Bills and Buds? Well, running a pricing site is hard work, but it probably didn't help much that its competitor was slamming it anonymously...

[Madking and Prellis_V2.0 both immediately attacked Vathian and his new Bills and Buds site](http://forums.steamgames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2201619&amp;page=4  )[(image)](http://i.imgur.com/CpfPN.png). Madking claims to have 1750 hours in TF2. (In fact, he doesn't, but *SmokedGouda* does... perhaps a case of being logged into the wrong account?).


Why do I believe Prellis_V2.0 is associated with the Spreadsheet?
----------------------------------------------------

Well, apart from the dozens of posts where Prellis_V2.0 is promoting the spreadsheet, posting links to it and defending it against critics...

On 25 August 2011, MadKing [spams the spreadsheet's new address yet again](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2075076). Prellis quickly replies ""Ok, I was looking for it too. Much better address! ""[(pic)](http://i.imgur.com/RdGEY.png).

The only reason Prellis has for posting this comment is to bump the thread back to the top and promote the spreadsheet, because he is clearly lying - *he already knows the  spreadsheet's address very well*, as [his post](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=24575461#post24575461) from 2 days earlier conclusively proves.  

And notice how in that last link Prellis and Madking (who are actually the same person), then have a bizarre little 'conversation' about how great the spreadsheet is (each post they make keeps bumping the thread back up to the top so more people can read it, of course).



Why do I believe the accounts SmokedGouda001, Madking/STF2, and Prellis_V2.0 are the same person?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've already seen SmokeGouda admit that he is Madking/STF2, but what about the Prellis_V2.0 account?

Despite many months of activity, Prellis_V2.0 **never** posts bids on anybody else's trades at the Steam Trading Forums, only SmokedGouda's, but *Prellis_V2.0 never actually buys anything from SmokedGouda*. In fact, in the majority of his 84 posts over several months, Prellis only does two things: (1) [Attempts to trade with SmokedGouda](http://i.imgur.com/TGGtk.png) (2) [Promotes the Spreadsheet and attacks its competitors](http://i.imgur.com/hDGFM.png). Can anyone show me any other account which is so bizarrely focused on two such apparently unrelated issues to the exclusion of all else...?

I believe the sole purpose of the Prellis_V2.0's trading posts is to inflate the value of SmokedGouda's items, and bump the threads back to the top of the trading forum, to get them more exposure to genuine traders. 

This evidence already seems overwhelming to me. There is no rational explanation for the activity of the Prellis_V2.0 account, unless it is an alt account. I believe these accounts, SmokedGouda001, Madking/STF2, and Prellis_V2.0, are in fact all controlled by the same person. There's additional circumstantial evidence, but I suspect this is already way too long for most people to read, so I'll just leave it there for now.

### Questions
## Why can't I just use my Steam ID?
Reddit does allow links in Flair. Since Steam IDs can easily be changed, and your link will stop working if you change it, using your Steam Profile Number will ensure that the link to your Profile continues working should you change your ID. The bot will validate the URL you submit. If you didn't follow the instructions above to get the link, your Flair will be rejected.

## Okay, but clickable links really would be a lot easier...
Well, I have even more good news! Redditor [blueshiftlabs](http://www.reddit.com/user/blueshiftlabs) has [written a script](http://redd.it/wvn2s) that will make all the Flair links in this subreddit fully clickable, as well as adding extra functions. It's compatible with Chrome and Firefox with the [Greasemonkey extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

## My Flair is still not appearing!
Please allow up to ten minutes for the bot to process your request. The bot will reply if your request has been rejected.

I take more security precautions than surely anyone does with their Steam account. I've interviewed 90% of the people hijacked over the holidays in the long string of account hijackings and put together guides and info to help people avoid hijackings.

The hijacker IM'd my friends who talked to him, and he said that my attempts to help people avoid hijackers caused him to see me as a challenge. And he won despite the significant precautions I take (as a developer) to secure my account.

Here's the sort of stuff I do to secure my account and it wasn't enough. It may have just delayed the inevitable:

* SteamGuard enabled always (of course)
* My steam username is different than other known names for me
* My steam email is different than my other known emails for me
* I use GMail-based email accounts, all with SteamGuard + GMail 2-factor authentication enabled. It calls my phone whenever I try to log into GMail from a new browser, IP or device.
* I use a complex password that is different from other sites
* I run three forms of malware protection (Malwarebytes, Avast, Microsoft Security Essentials)
* Since the holiday hijackings began in earnest, I monitor my running processes multiple times a day with Process Explorer and look for any unsigned binaries or signed ones from unknown vendors. (This gets pretty easy, and I should do a tutorial on doing that.)
* I get added by lots of people and never click on a link that looks even slightly suspicious, or from people I don't recognize.

I know for a fact that any sufficiently motivated attacker with enough time will always get their 50/50 chance to get into any account at some point. This fellow was motivated and found someway to bypass all of those approaches.

**Edit1:** My profile (now just backpack) just went private, so this is where the merchandise gets moved to other accounts to be resold or redirected to the hijacker's private stashes.

**Edit2:** It's 7am my time now and I'm headed to bed. My answers are probably getting sleepy-incoherent anyway. :(

**Edit3:** A very nice and pleasant Valve employee who happened to be working the weekend locked the account at ~11am, but that only assures the hijacker can't use my identity anymore. The collection is surely filtering through accounts right now to hide its traces-- he's very good. :( 

**Edit4:** I'm back in my account, but don't assume it's me until I'm sure things are in solid order. All my unusuals and collectibles are gone now.

**Edit5:** **The hacker used personal information about me to convince Steam Support he was me and get them to give their account to him. So none of the above technical approaches fell victim, but he did have access to enough personal information to social engineer his way in. I haven't been as paranoid careful about my identity as I should have been, so be careful with yours!**

**Edit6:** I have most of my items back, waiting on a few stragglers to be added.


**Edit7:** I got this note supposedly from the hijacker himself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfmLDQ13DgY&amp;feature=youtu.be

Note that: 

* Steam required him to provide more information than just my email, heh. He uncovered more private details to make the ticket quite convincing. Social engineering is alive and well. 
* Of course anyone could be hijacked. Anyone who knows much about security knows that it's just a matter of time that it will fall if someone is determined enough. :( I just wish he'd put his cleverness to use solving more substantial problems and making money that way than causing unhappiness for people. :(

We've had the idea for a redesign on our heads for a long time now, so we're glad we finally got around to getting one!

We understand TF2Trade attracts many people that have never been introduced to Reddit, so we wanted to make it as easy to understand as possible, eliminating Reddit-specific elements that TF2Trade never needed, while making others more visible and easier to understand.

I also took the time to tweak the design to work well with the Reddit Enhancement Suite, including in Night-mode. I don't use it myself, but I'm sure many of you do.

We made the sidebar easier to read and added accessible links to many common resources that got lost in the previous design. Feel free to suggest other resources that may deserve to be linked there.

If you dislike the design for whatever reason, please remember it's possible to disable this style in your preferences options, but some content may not be optimized for you.

We also did a lot of cross-browser testing with different setups, but there will always be a few bugs in these designs, given how difficult it is to achieve something like this using only CSS. Please report any problems you may have with the design in this thread.

We hope you all like it!

Hello all! Kevin Spacey here looking to spread a little tf2 joy! I figured its time to pass along some of the wealth from my tf2 bp, and do another unusual give way (I have done this in the past, and love to give these and other items away to deserving new players, as well as the not so new players that can't seem to get to the unusual level). 

**Whats up to give away today is: Unusual Larrikin Robin (Green Confetti)**

So now, how do you get this fine unusual for the low low price of free you ask?  Simple!

 **First of all, fall within a few quick rules:**

No unusuals in your bp

No Buds in your bp

Have sniper as one of your top 5 most played class( I will modify this to say that the winner must be open to keeping the hat and expanding there sniper usage)


**Now past those rules I would like a to add a little extra challenge.**

Tell me your most embarrassing tf2 moment (ubering a spy by accident when pushing to last, trying to take out the enemy team with your freshly bought rocket jumper, etc). We all make these mistakes, lets hear yours!

**How will the winner be chosen?**

The most upvoted comments will get a slight edge, but in the end it just comes down to my preference. With all that being said, **GET TO POSTING, I""M GIVING AWAY A FREE UNUSUAL FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!**

This will end no later than 9pm tomorrow night (March 20th 9pm Centeral Time US), but could end at any time. Don't wait, post up **NOW!!!!**

Do you like free things? I like free things! (So I shall assume you like free things) 

I am holding a raffle for a selection of my finest wares. There are Genuine's, Vintage's and Strange Weapons as well as a HAT!

**You probably have some questions:**

* *""How do I obtain these wonderful items?""* 

Well it couldn't be easier, all you need to do is reply below with your username!

* *""What's the catch?""* 

None! I want to give back to you guys, I love playing on the Reddit TF2 servers with you lot and this is my way of paying you back!

* *""What is in it for you?""*

I get the happiness knowing that the people on here who are passionate about TF2 have got a new shiny item for free! This is a karma free post so I don't even get that! I genuinely want to make people happy!

* *""How do we know you wont just give the items away to your friends?""* 

I have given my friends plenty of stuff already, they have what they want! This is what is left over!

* *""Are shadows made of atoms?""* 

A shadow is the difference between an area well illuminated by light photons and an area not so well illuminated. It's made of photons, not atoms. Photons are particles of energy, the exact nature of which can be explained in terms of the quantum theory of light. 

**Onto the PRIZES!**

2. Genuine Companion Cube Pin
3. The Dead Cone (Pyro Hat)

The /r/tf2trade annual Secret Santa event has begun! The bot has been tested, the mistletoe hung &amp; the yule log is burning. Let's get started!

**How does this work?**

You are given a random match (your **giftee**) whom you must gift to. Another person will be randomly matched to gift you something (your **secret santa**). You can gift anything from hats to games, anything that is digital. 

Be creative! Stalk your receiver's account to get an idea of their favorite class, check his Steam wishlist, or even gift-wrap your items to forever remind your recipient of your kindness! Remember, this is meant to be fun!


**Is there a minimum/maximum spending limit?**

There is a **2 reclaimed** value minimum for gifting so people don't sign up just to get free things and ruin the spirit of the event. There is no maximum spending limit. 

--------------------------

**How do I sign up?**

Signing up is easy! Just follow the instructions below:

**^Please ^note, ^you ^must ^have ^a ^reddit ^account ^of ^3 ^months+ ^age ^to ^sign ^up**

**1)** Send a [message to Steambot (click here)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Steambot&amp;subject=Secret%20Santa) with ""Secret Santa"" as the subject and your SteamID64 as the message. A guide on how to get your 
SteamID64 can be read [here](http://redd.it/1404y7).


*Please make sure your SteamID64 does ****not*** *have a forward slash (/) at the end of it, otherwise the bot will send you an error message.*

**2)** Steambot will send you a verification string, place this in your summary section of your steam profile as seen [here](http://puu.sh/1w6yv.jpg). You must do this within 5 minutes of receiving the message. 

**3)** Wait 5 minutes for Steambot to check your profile and send you back a message and you're done! Well done, you've been entered into the /r/tf2trade secret santa event. You will be sent your match on December 7th. 



----

[Here's a video for this event made by our very own rolmos!](http://vimeo.com/54570790)

Signups for the event will last untill December 6th, and matches will be sent out on December 7th. 

The match you receive in your Reddit inbox will be the person you'll have to send a gift to. **The gift must be of at least 2 reclaimed in value, and must be sent before December 27th.** Gifts can be TF2 items, Steam games, and other digital items, but there's no limit! 

*Gaming the system or intentionally receiving and not giving is considered an act of dishonesty that will result in the offender being marked a scammer by SteamRep.*

Guess he just lost track of time. Sticks up a sign. ""Be back tomorrow.""

---

Proper story's supposed to begin at the beginning, but it's been a while now. We just collected stuff over time. Don't look like they're good for much, but we try to sell 'em anyway. Kid ain't had much luck the past couple of days, but he ain't complaining. He never was one for talkin' much.

---
**New items**

I guess since the calamity most people don't use real currency. Just barter instead. Guess I'm just old fashioned.

* **Pocket Purrer - 1.33 ref**

Cute little thing don't like to be alone. Likes to travel though. Sits in this pouch and purrs contentedly. Innocent eyes wide at the world. Loyal too. 

* **Blokes Bucket - 1.33 ref**

Ain't much fish to catch nowadays. Don't people from going fishin' though. Guess fish never were the point anyway.

* **Pyro's Beanie - 1.33 ref**

Ain't always much to say.

---


* **Strange Liberty Launcher (Crit Kills, Demomen Killed, Kills Whilst Explosive Jumping) - 1 key**

Knocked the kid right off his feet. Maybe leave it for another time.

* **Strange Stickybomb Launcher - 1 rec (x2)**

Some people let the enemies come to them. No harm in being prepared.

* **Strange Big Earner - 1 rec**

Some people convince others they're one of their own before they strike. Even the kid don't like to get that close.

---

* **Black Paint (A distinctive lack of hue) - 2 keys + 2 ref**

Calamity redecorated everything. Just gotta rebuild. Paint's scarce though. 


---

Guess most of this junk's gonna be here a while. Just rust and wreckage.

* **Strange Parts: Robots Destroyed 1 key 0.55 ref**

Some people like to count what they kill. Kid ain't much for that and I ain't much for killing.

* **Strange Parts Kills: Whilst explosive jumping - 2 rec**

Some people don't walk. They just about fly. Seem to get around faster that way, even if it hurts the knees.

* **Strange Parts: Sappers Destroyed - 1 ref 1 rec**



---

**SOLD**

Some stuff goes quicker than others. Kid records it in his diary. Suppose he's lost enough already, no point in losing memories too.

* ~~Strange Pistol - 1 rec~~

It's no repeater, but it fires smooth and fast. Gasfellas are gonna sting bad.

* ~~White Bills - 10 keys~~

Thought we finally found kid something to tame his hair. No such luck. The fine material looked nice though. Probably belonged to some fancy pants. Ain't got much use for that kind of thing 'round here.

*  ~~All father (Uncraft, painted white)~~

Thing looked like a Santa beard. Big, bushy and made of fine white hair. Stood out like a unicorn. Reminded us better times. 

* ~~Made Man - 2 ref~~

A real rose. Don't know how it survived the calamity. Best give it away if we want it to survive, ain't much fertile ground around here. Brought a smile to the kids face though. Made the day worthwhile.

* ~~Capo's Capper 1.33 ref~~

Found it on a Gasfella. Suppose he thought himself real tough. Kid popped him good.

* ~~Tricorne 1.33 ref~~

Robbed a scumbag of his last meal. Took his hat as well. Ain't worth much. But it's better than nothing.

* ~~Dr Whoa - 3.66 ref~~

Sometimes, you just need a bowtie. What I used to believe, anyhow. Ain't got much occasion for one since the world came tumblin' down. Looked nice though.


* ~~Gold Botkiller Wrench - 6.5 keys~~

Kid found a Squirt playing with this. Shiny thing ain't much of a play toy. We gave it a ball instead. Well, it's a touching reunion, but it don't fit anything around here. Guess it just wasn't our day.

* ~~Rust Botkiller Minigun - 2.55 ref~~

Thing's covered in rust, practically fell of a building. Ain't a gift from the Gods, but it'll have to do. Too heavy for the kid. Might be good for a bigger man though.

* ~~Genuine K-9 Mane - 1.33 ref~~

Not everyone retained their sanity. Some went back to the old ways, from the days before the wall.

* ~~Strange Sniper rifle - 2.33 ref~~

Kid likes to get up close. Guess it ain't everyone's style. 

* ~~Tour of Duty Ticket - 1.22 ref~~
A ticket to hell itself. Worse than even the who-knows-where. But someone's gotta go.

* ~~Green Paint - 0.66 ref~~

I ain't gonna begrudge a man who wants to blend in. Standing out? Not always wise. Guess the kid ain't never learned that lesson. Probably never will.

---------------------------------

Hello [/r/tf2trade](/r/tf2trade)rs!

You may remember me, or maybe not. I've quit trading, but that doesn't mean I've abandoned you guys!

Today, up for grabs in this **48 hour** raffle, is a **Fall Key**! That's right, guys and gals, I'm raffling away one fine looking piece of metal!  
You may think, ""This guy is a shmuck, I'm gonna win his key and never check out his servers, muahahaha!"" Well, to you I say this: &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;.

Let's list the rules of this little raffle first (powered by redditraffle.com) before I go on my spiel.

To enter this raffle, you must:

* Have a Reddit account **at least** a week old
* Have flair (**Non-negotiable, folks. Sorry! No flair, no entry!**)
* Include the word ""mentlegen"" in your comment (**SUPER IMPORTANT!**)
* Upvote this post (well, it's not required, but it's the least you can do, right?)

And that's it for the rules! Everyone has an equal chance to win!

--------------------------------

***Now onto the purpose of this raffle...***

Now, I'm a humble server owner. I run 3 little servers (trade, MvM, vanilla maps), and it's my dream to see them grow popular and have lots of people play on them.

So what I'd like *you* to do is to check out my servers! Favourite them, play on them often, and help me fill them! 

Oftentimes you'll join my servers and find them empty. But that's okay - please don't leave! Invite your friends, invite your enemies, invite your mother! I don't care, I just want my servers to fill up and have lots of people playing and enjoying themselves on them.

My servers are run with a simple philosophy: **community**. I like to foster an environment where everyone can chill and have a good time, and I watch over them to help it happen. So play on my servers, make friends, and have fun!

Would you like to help out? Join my [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CommunityTrade) and read about how you can contribute to the CTS community!

Check out the CTS's temporary (until I get a better domain and host) [homepage](http://tf2.servegame.com/) where you can see how many users are currently playing, or the [CTS SourceBan's](http://tf2.servegame.com/sourcebans/) page, which serves the same purpose essentially.

Or you can just **hop right in** and join any of my 3 servers! Simply click the IP to join if Steam is running!

The holiday season is upon us. Whether you wish everyone a merry Christmas, a happy Chanuckah, crazy Kwanza, or a Festivus for the Rest of us, it does not matter.


As we all know, the holidays is about **giving** and not receiving. In the spirit of that, I am gauging interest for a [/r/tf2trade](/r/tf2trade) TF2 item **SECRET SANTA!**

The rules would be simple:

1. If you enter the Secret Santa, you must deliver your gift by the January 5th. We understand people go out of town and whatnot over the holidays. So if you cannot make the January 5th deadline, you will need to contact a moderator.

2. You will be randomly paired (trying to figure out how to do this currently)

3. You may give games, TF2 items, or other digital items but try to make it something the person wants

4. There is a 2 reclaimed metal minimum, meaning you must spend at least 2 reclaimed for the person you are getting a gift for. **But there is no limit! So give a Bill's, some Buds, a Max Head!** 

5. To sign up, you must have a reddit account with at least 1 submission or comment as of December 2, 2011. 

6. Gaming the system or *intentionally* receiving and not giving is considered an act of dishonesty that may result in the offender being marked a scammer by SteamRep.

***

**SO! What do you think?** We need your feedback before we make our (well your) dream of hats a reality. 

Currently we are exploring our options as far as a system to get everyone signed up. Once we select a system we will allow registration and conduct pairings as soon as practicable.

1330979570.0,137,self.tf2trade,qj16q,So I decided to try trading through TF2outpost today,152,15,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/qj16q/so_i_decided_to_try_trading_through_tf2outpost/,"* I made 2 successful trades through it this morning. It seemed like a nice place to trade tf2 items. Then I noticed a nice offer in various paints that I was interested in. 

* The trader was selling co orange paint, among others at 1rec +2scraps each, as the trade thread was stating. I sent a friend request and waited for the trader. Shortly afterwards the trader came.

* The trader asked what was it about, and I said that I was interested in the orange paint at the price that he was asking. To my suprise, the trader asked 2 rec for it. I politely told the trader that this was not the mentioned price in the thread he made. The trader said that it was his last orange(..) and the price has changed. I asked him again if he is sure about this, stating that this is just bad trade reputation, the trader smirked that- I quote: ""bad rep is removed from tf2outpost"". As if it really mattered.

* I cancelled the trade. I also added my experience in the trade thread and his profile, as I do find this kind of behavior repulsive. And I head to work.

* Later tonight, I found out **I got banned from tf2outpost**. The site redirects me to this [page](http://i.imgur.com/6BFzH.png) that I read: 

* ""You have been banned until 16:36:31 GMT on 6th March, 2012 for the following reason:

* **Like I said, I have sold many, and I only have one left of it so I would like 2 rec for it. This is yet not why I am banning you. I am banning you for bursting out in hate on my trade. I'll give you a 24 hours ban.**

* Turns out the trader, [DeMo ☠ [WAIT FOR TURN]](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035908036), is some kind of administrator in the tf2outpost. 

* I think I laughed, really hard. When my wife read it, the laughter continued. For once the so called ""bursting out in hate"" is something I can't see myself capable of. I also fail to see how banning the person that stated something as obvious as ""the price is not the one mentioned in the thread"" can be justified. Petty people can only be funny, no matter how hard they try for the opposite.

* I will continue using tf2outpost for my future trade requests, if I am not banned for life after this thread (lol). I just felt I had to share this experience with others. For the laughs. I am sorry for a rather long post. Cheers.

* **EDIT**. Potatosol agreed to trade his orange paint for the same price without banning anyone in the process. Thank you reddit.

* **EDIT No2**. I finaly have **the orange hat I always wanted**. You can **check it out** [here](http://tf2b.com/item/76561198004569195/45101196). What is bizarre, is that the trader I got the name tag from, started the trade by saying ""I also got banned from tf2outpost"". lol. ""So you read my thread?"". I can't hold myself from laughing while I am typing this. Thank you all for your help in making this hat a pixel legend. I will take good care of it.

* **EDIT FINAL**. I have decided to close this trade story thread. I feel that it lived long enough for every side involved to be heard. I thank every redditor for the time they spent here and for the thoughts they shared. Many things were written here, but it is still a simple **""just for a laugh""** thread, as intended from the beginning.

Asks me for the price of one of my unusuals. Wants to check that my unusual is not duped and sends me a link, saying it's to check one's bp for any dupes.  We open up a trade,  he sends the link asking that I check if it's a dupe or not.  I click the link, less than 15-20 seconds pass, I re-open the trade window and see that it says ""trade completed"" and freak the fuck out, a split second later, he deletes me.

Anyways, I have no idea how this works but when I clicked it, he logged in as me or somehow had control of the trade,  the thing is that it happened in less than 30 seconds between me clicking the link and him stealing my 6 earbuds and [Unusual Defiant Spartan \(searing plasma\)](http://www.tf2items.com/item/708322732) 

Here's the conversation: http://i.imgur.com/qDFIq.png

***TL;DR:  don't click on any links within TF2.***

*Edit*:  To clear some things up:

-I did not have to log into anything after clicking the link.  I just clicked it and a pop up window came up saying it was checking my bp and might take a while.

-I did not have any items in the trade window.  He had to have added the items himself and completed the trade himself.  I am guessing that he tailor made a script to add the specific items I had (earbuds) and then complete the trade since it happened so quickly.

-By the time you read this I hope he's listed as a scammer on steamrep,  he appeared clean when he first contacted me.


*Edit2*:  After talking with a few others I am going to guess that this scammer wrote a specific script that added the earbuds and unusual and completed the trade by itself.  The scammer was after my unusual Defiant Spartan which I have never advertised as for sale, either that or he was after my earbuds and took a liking to the spartan.  The reason he did not take other unusuals is because  I would have quickly noticed things were being added on the steam trade window.  His script added the earbuds and the unusual immediately, which is why he deleted me almost right after I told him I had clicked it.   This script has to work in the same fashion that certain links auto-friend someone or opens up a steam survey if you have steam open.

Please be careful.,146,16,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/rm9rn/psa_new_popular_scam_attempt_middleman_injection/,"Today, someone in the RUGC chat was asking if $220 for his Stormy Marauder was a good deal.

We all told him it was, so he proceeded to talk to the guy offering it.

The scammer asked him to pick a middleman. Because no /r/tf2trade mods or SteamRep middlemen were online at the time, he asked me to middleman for him.

The scammer surprisingly agreed (I don't have SteamRep status and only 2 middleman rep) - and I was dragged into the chat.

I check the other guy's profile - private. No rep. Obviously this raised some red flags, and I told the owner of the hat not to do the deal.

A while afterwards, he chat-ed me, asked me to ""return his unusual"". I was shocked and told him I did not have it. Apparently, the scammer used an injection scam and got the guy to impersonate me quickly after he agreed on me being the middleman.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/sTcNs.png) is a screenshot of the guy's past names. (I'm The Cynical Cool Bean)

Honestly, this scam attempt is pretty ingenious.

**Unlike all other scam attempts, it throws you off and earns your trust by getting you to pick the middleman. The scammer then gets his friend to change his name/display photo to the agreed middleman, and the impersonator trades you.**

Another thing: Just because someone is going first doesn't mean they won't scam. **They can still chargeback PayPal payment.** This is why SOP sellers require some form of rep for you to buy from them, even when you're going first.

**Never do a cash trade with ANYONE with a private profile, unless they have a shitload of rep. Even then, make sure it's really them and not an impersonator.**

And remember, always, ALWAYS check the SteamRep of the person you're passing your items to, right before you do so.

1352053623.0,126,self.tf2trade,12mdu4,[PSA] An advice-filled rant from a veteran trader.  Kind of a semi-guide.,140,14,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/12mdu4/psa_an_advicefilled_rant_from_a_veteran_trader/,"Hello, r/tf2trade.

I’ve been planning on writing a guide for some time now, since I frequently get asked for trading advice.

However, instead of writing a generic “how 2 trade wepons” guide, I decided to do a sort of a rant on the art of TF2 trading.  

I apologize if the content of this post seems kind of random/disorganized.  I’m speaking my mind here, and my mind isn’t always the most organized place.

Anyway, there are a number of misconceptions and incorrect assumptions people cling to when starting off trading.

I’m hoping to clear some things up in this post, since I get tired of seeing people getting frustrated when their unrealistic expectations are not met.

**First off, some background information/credentials:**

(Be sure to sign in to tf2items.com or register there first).

[I have been playing TF2 since the very beginning.](http://www.tf2items.com/item/78656744)

[This is what my BP looked like before I started trading.](http://www.tf2items.com/id/Varren?time=1312176161)

[And this is what it looked like 1 year later.](http://www.tf2items.com/id/Varren?time=1343877992)

Quite the difference, eh?  And I never spent any of my own, real-life money on anything!  Nor have I ever unboxed an Unusual myself!

Now, some of you are probably thinking:

**“Oh look, this guy is just using this post as an excuse to brag about his successes in trading!  What a pompous, arrogant asshole!”**

But that is not at all my intent.  My BP isn’t even remotely close to being impressive compared to the true kingpins of the TF2 trading world.

Still, I have been trading for over a year now, and I’ve learned quite a bit about what works and what doesn’t, and I’d like to share my thoughts with some less-experienced traders.

**”So, how did you do it, Varren?  How did you go from a few Refined to Unusuals galore?”**

These are, in my opinion, the main keys to overall success in TF2 Trading:

**1. Luck**

**2. Persistence/Time Investment**

**3.  Professionalism/Politeness**

I’ll go through each one in-depth.

First off, **luck.**

I won’t lie; I got extremely lucky many times throughout my trading career.  Some examples (feel free to skip down to “the point”)...

When I first started buying and selling craft hats, I really didn’t bother with actually crafting them.

One day, though, I decided on a whim to craft two Ellis Caps together.

[Lo and behold...](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/558686202376963744/7B105DF1E1D70A0691F2C796813D7E7FC7329ED8/)

I ended up selling it for around 10 Keys.  Practically doubled my backpack’s value just like that.

And so began my love affair with hat crafting.

I started crafting hats together more regularly, and I kept getting nice items, such as the Last Breath, Team Captain, Dr. Whoa, and so on.

I didn’t *just* get good items.  I got plenty of crappy hats too.  But overall I gained more than I lost.

One day I ended up crafting the #4 Surgeon’s Side-Satchel.  I didn’t even know about craft numbers, so I wasn’t sure what to expect.

I ended up trading it for my first Unusual: Steaming Your Worst Nightmare.  This was when I realized how much better it was to craft things together only when new items were released.

And so I began hording craft hats like crazy.  I had over 300 craft hats and miscs when the Pyromania update was released.

[The results of my Pyromania crafting spree.](http://imgur.com/a/1j905#0)

I ended up trading about half of them for 2 Buds total.  Four of the lowest crafts were traded for a Smoking Dragonborn Helmet.

Another good example of me getting lucky was when I got invited to the DotA 2 beta very early on, and received two tradeable guest passes.  

None of my friends wanted to play with me, so I ended up trading the invites for about 1 buds each.  Not bad!

**Luck - The Point:**  Luck is a *major* factor in how successful you are.  Whether it’s randomly unboxing a valuable unusual, crafting a low craft # item, or just getting a good deal in a trade.

Now, does that mean I would advise opening Mann Co. crates until you unbox a Burning Team Captain?  **Absolutely not.**

Nor should you avoid taking risks altogether.  **The important thing is to be careful with what risks you take.**  Hat crafting is, in my opinion, one of your best choices when it comes to taking a risk, and can pay off early on.

The other thing to take away from this is to **not feel bad if you’re not making profit as fast as you wish you were.**  You can be offering a fair price for craft hats/weapons/whatever, **but so are many other people.**  You have lots of competition in the world of TF2 trading.

This brings me to my next point: **Persistence/Time Investment**

Basically, the more time you devote to trading, and the more consistent you are with “bumping” your trades, the more successful you will be.

I’ll be honest.  One of the big reasons I’ve been so successful is that I’m an unemployed college drop-out.  I spend almost all day at my computer, responding to friend requests, closing and opening trades on multiple websites, looking around for any good deals, and organizing my inventory.

When buying Unusuals especially, I spend a *lot* of time researching pricing and market trends.

I payed $10 to obtain the donator rank on TF2 Outpost.  That means I can have 25 different trade posts open at once, and they will each automatically bump to the front page after 1 hour.

The more time you spend creating and bumping your trades, **the more likely you are to actually buy/sell things.**

I use TF2 Outpost, TF2 Trade Post, SourceOP, TF2 Bazaar, **and** r/tf2trade to advertise my wares.

Back in the day, I used to have **10 different posts for buying craft hats on TF2 Outpost.**  One for each class, and one for all-class hats.  I worked my ass off in order to advertise my services more than anyone else.  I also had similar posts on TF2TP.

[Here’s an example of one of the hat-buying posts I used to have.](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3119544)

So, if you think you’re not making profit fast enough, you need to ask yourself:

**”Am I really putting in the effort needed to make the amount of profit I want to make?”**

And adjust your trading strategies accordingly.  If you’re lazy and just hope that you get a lucky break, then you are not likely going to be raking in the profits.

**”Yeah, but unlike you I actually have a job/school/real-life commitments!  I can only invest so much time into TF2 trading!”**

So LOWER YOUR FREAKING EXPECTATIONS!  No one is going to become a millionaire by trading virtual hats!  Even with all the time I put into trading, I still just barely make over minimum wage, if that!

**Persistence/Time Investment - The Point:**  For most people, TF2 trading is just a hobby.  If you’re one of these people, then **you need to treat it as such.**  If you already have a good job IRL, then congratulations, you’ve accomplished more than I ever have.

However, if you do have the time to devote to TF2 trading, and you do want to try and get to the point where you’re making a semi-respectable amount of money, then you’ve got to **make yourself stand out.**

Which brings us to my last point: **Professionalism/Politeness**.

Unfortunately, as this is the Internet, people are prone to [being excessively unpleasant and rude to other people.](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/)

Anyone who has spent a decent amount of time on TF2 Outpost can surely attest to this.

It seems obvious, but I really think it needs to be stated very clearly here:

**YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN TF2 TRADING IF YOU ACT LIKE A WHINEY, IGNORANT, SELF-ENTITLED LITTLE BITCH!**

Seriously, you’re not.

If you act like a prick, people are going to dislike you.  And if people dislike you, they are not going to want to trade with you.  Ever.

Does that mean you should be *excessively* nice and friendly?  Of course not.  That will make you seem obnoxious.

So, how should you act?  **Like a Goddamned Professional.**

Be nice and respectful towards people who are nice and respectful towards you.

If someone starts insulting you or treating you with disrespect, **do not insult them back.**  You’re a professional, not a 4th grader.

If someone makes an insulting post in your TF2 Outpost trade post, don’t even respond to them.  Just hide the post and move on.  Don’t waste your energy on trolls.

If someone adds you and it turns out they did not read the trade notes and get mad at you, just remove them from your Friends list and move on.

**You want to build a positive reputation for yourself.**

[Take a look at my steam profile.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/varren)

Notice the 60 pages of people saying “+rep”.  I have gone out of my way to make trading a pain-free experience for people.  I make my trade notes very clear and respond to Friend requests as soon as possible.

I have had many, many, many repeat customers due to how I treat people with respect and professionalism.

It got to the point where I even made a steam group just for people who traded with me on a regular basis.

I go out of my way to format my posts on TF2 Outpost and r/tf2trade in such a way that they are extremely comprehensive and easy to read/understand.

I constantly ask myself, **”Is there something I can be doing to make things easier/more painless for my customers?”**

Obviously there have been times when I’ve gotten into some very heated arguments with people, and there are still a number of people who have a vehement dislike for me, especially in this subreddit.  Oh well.

You *are* going to make *someone* angry at some point.  Don’t worry about it.  [Haters are going to hate.](http://i.imgur.com/MVOIR.gif)

**Professionalism/Politeness - The Point:**  It doesn’t take much to make yourself stand out from the masses on TF2 Outpost.  Most of my advice on being respectful and polite should just be common sense.

**Final Thoughts**

The art of TF2 trading is more complicated than it seems.  Just figuring out *what* to buy and sell can be confusing enough.  But it is just as important to think about *how* you conduct yourself in the world of TF2/Steam trading.

If the trading scene is stressing you out, just take a break, man.  You’ve got enough shit to worry about IRL.  You don’t need to be constantly worrying about buying and selling pixels.

I also recommend just asking yourself, **”What, exactly, do I want to accomplish with TF2 trading?”**

If you’re not going to try and make a living from online trading, then you should adjust your expectations accordingly.  **It took me over a year to get to where I am now.**

I hope I’ve helped at least someone out here.  If not, oh well, I just needed to rant a bit I guess.

If people still have some concerns or questions, I’ll be more than happy to discuss things further in the comments, but please keep your rude/insulting comments to yourself.

These are just my personal thoughts and comments and I don’t expect everyone to agree with them.

Anyway, that’s that.  I wish you all luck in your future trading endeavors.

So although I like my hat a holiday like this can't be passed up.

So selling my Moon Brain Slug for 13 buds or $360

This is a limited moon effect and it is 1 of 4. 1 belongs to sunspy, 1 belongs to a vac banned steam user, 1 belongs to someone else and 1 belongs to me. Only one on the market not being sold by a scammer :)

The hat is clean (I bought it directly from the unboxer).

It is described ""Luna's only friend for those sad 1000 years"" and is painted white.

This is the lowest I'll go on price, it actually hurts me a little to let it go for this price, so please don't offer anything lower.

Some of the lovely offers I've gotten in the past(in no particular order):

* Scorching Flames Milkman + 28 Keys
* Team Captain w/ Orb. Planets
* HOUWAR + fetti noble
* Stormy bonk boy + 3
* hearts villains veil + 3 (this one was really hard to not take but cash&gt;hearts)
* Stormy hard counter+Burning mining light+Burning bloke
* Lvl 100 blizz waxy wayfinder + rare clean craftable summer full use noisemaker and maybe some other minor sweets
* and about 100 lowballs. Funniest of which was 3 keys + a replacement regular slug...

This has probably been our most requested feature, aside from free hats for everybody. At long last, you can add a link to your Steam Profile next to your username! Here's how:

* Go to [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/) and enter your Profile Name.
* Find the line that begins with ""steamID64"". This is the URL you need. URLs containing your profile name will be rejected.
* Copy the URL and [send a message to BigFriendlyRobot](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=bigfriendlyrobot&amp;subject=tf2trade). Leave the subject line alone, paste the URL into the message, and hit ""Send"".
* You're good to go! It can take up to ten minutes for the bot to process your request, so please be patient. Thanks go to [ExtremePopcorn](http://www.reddit.com/user/ExtremePopcorn) for hosting the bot to automate all this!

### Questions
## Why can't I just use my Steam ID?
Reddit does allow links in Flair. Since Steam IDs can easily be changed, and your link will stop working if you change it, using your Steam Profile Number will ensure that the link to your Profile continues working should you change your ID. The bot will validate the URL you submit. If you didn't follow the instructions above to get the link, your Flair will be rejected.

## Okay, but clickable links really would be a lot easier...
Well, I have even more good news! Redditor [zedadex](http://www.reddit.com/user/zedadex) has [written a script](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/kaucc/tf2trade_flair_linker/) that will make all the Flair links in this subreddit fully clickable. It's compatible with Chrome and Firefox with the [Greasemonkey extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

## My Flair is still not appearing!

Full text of blog post:


Bidwell was taking stock of some of our older merchandise this week and found out some idiot's been using one of our warehouses to store pallets of spoiled mayonnaise. Raccoons all over the place. Fancy Fedoras, Prussian Pickehaubes, Football Helmets -- these items were part of Mann Co. history. Some of them were the first items we ever shipped. They deserved a better end than rotting in a puddle of rotten condiments and raccoon poop, let me tell you.

Here's a complete list of all the stock we lost: BATTER’S HELMET, SOLDIER’S STASH, PYRO’S BEANIE, DEMOMAN’S FRO, FOOTBALL HELMET, MINING LIGHT, PRUSSIAN PICKELHAUBE, TROPHY BELT and FANCY FEDORA. That's right, folks: These hats are gone. 

For the next two weeks, we're selling anything in the warehouse that wasn't damaged. Purchase and craft these things while you can, because once the two weeks are up I'm burning the warehouse down. Also, I don't know if you can get rabies from wearing a hat that a raccoon bit, but if you can don't come crying to me about it. If you don't want your hats to give you diseases, don't buy them out of warehouses, that's my advice. That's just one of the reasons I wear as few clothes as possible at all times. Never been sick in my life.
 


**Item retirement FAQ**


Q: What is happening to this set of nine hats in two weeks?  
A: These items will no longer be sold in the store, randomly dropped, unboxed as unusuals, or acquired through crafting.

Q: What happens to copies of these items that are already in my backpack?  
A: All existing copies of the items will remain unaffected.

Q: What about older crates that have these items as a potential drop?  
A: Crates that contain these items will still have a chance at unboxing them in normal quality only.

Q: How will I now acquire these items?  
A: These items are still useable in trading.

Q: Will these items ever come out of retirement?  
A: No. Once an item is retired it will stay that way.

Q: Will more items be retired in the future?  
A: Advance notice will be given if any other items will be retired.",,False,,t5_2s0s4,1357853767.0,,default,True,t3_16c5py,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/16c5py/psa_valve_is_retiring_the_original_9_hats/,

We are working to make it so your flair here will match your SR. This will help us mods determine who are scammers and who needs to go. It will also help you know at least at a glance who has neutral rep. 

Right now we are looking at a system where you will sign in through steam and then confirm your reddit name. That is all that is going to be required and should be only a 1 time thing.

Once you set your profile, you will not be able to change it. This will prevent people from swapping their flair and creating an alt. Understand, that people may create alternate reddit names and steam accounts if one is banned. However, I am also working on a system for detecting this, so within the future that will not be an issue.
***

As far as for the failure to have flair, I have not decided yet if we will set the subreddit to ""approved submitters only"" and only allow those with set flair to submit posts as they will be set to an approved submitter, or have AutoMod remove all posts from people without flair.

I am open to suggestions.

I entered my username and password and it prompted me for Steam Guard. My email didn't receive a message instantly, though, and I became a little bit suspicious. After looking back at the fake site, I realized it was a phishing link, and freaked the fuck out and changed all my passwords.

A few minutes later I received an ""access from a new computer"" email, which more likely than not was from a server hosted by the phishing website.

I would like to break this into 2 parts, firstly:

I found the woman of my life and she's better than anything I've ever thought was imaginable.  We've been dating for a while and the economy is kinda rough.. blah blah blah.  Anyways, I have my entire backpack for sale.  It is a very extensive collection of some of the finer things the Mannco world has to offer.  I have an engagement ring picked out and figured that since it's something she will be wearing everyday for at least the next 20-30 years that I might as well sell my virtual hats and get her the best I can reasonably afford.

Secondly, I must thank some of the best individuals that have become good friends and helped me out in the Reddit, trading, and general TF2 community.  Without you, I would not have accumulated such wealth and I hope you the best in the TF2 world and life in general: Rend (Biggest influence, got me into trading and my new player donation habit), [RG] Bacon (He paid for the reddit tf2 trade servers way long ago!), Craftbox, [MiT] Nurse, ScooterYDKJ, KevinSpacey, Cynical CoolBean, and all those in RUGC chat.  I could go on and on all day about how great these people are and the things they have done for the TF2 community.

I did my best to price at, if not much better, than what I saw on tf2 outpost, tradepost, and warehouse or was pc'd by RUGC members.  I am a very fair trader, so feel free to add me to offer.
* There are A LOT of things for me to sell, thus I am splitting this up into part1 and part2. Part2 will contain all the hats, miscs, genuines, stranges, and vintages.
* I really want to cash out quickly and get this done with, so any help would be greatly appreciated.  I already have a few rings picked out that I will choose from depending on how much money this turns out, and I'll make sure to give my fellow redditors a fair price on everything so upvote if for good prices and visibility.

This would be the next natural progression. As a mod/trading community administration team, we feel as if we are able to handle the increased traffic and whatnot surrounding cash trades. Before now we weren't. But, we have a very strong team and we think its time to make the jump into cash trading.

Here are the rules we would impose:

1. Trade at your own risk. 

2. Cash trades can **only** be made for Bill's, Buds, Max Heads, Refined Metal, HOUWAR, Keys, and Unusuals. **NOTHING ELSE**

3. RedditRep threads (such as A+++ would buy again) for sellers are not allowed. This is because they are easily faked.

4. Cash trades would be allowed on the server, chatroom, and subreddit. 

***

We, as mods, will compile a list of trusted middle men. Over time we may allow people to apply to become a trusted middle man. Also, short of some one being straight up **scammed** the moderators will not become involved in any trade. If someone over-pays for something, that is your own fault.

Also, **we will produce more trading guides to help those who jump from item/game trading to cash trading**. We are fortunate enough to have a few power traders as mods and willing to write guides for you all.

* Must have a Reddit account at least two weeks or older. 

* If not in flair, please link to your Steam Account!

*  **Upvote for everyone to have a chance!**

* Not required, but include an embarrassing story about yourself, whether it be in TF2 or real life. Make reading this thread more fun :)

I removed the post because it incorrectly is causing a false sense of panic.

First of all, relax.

Valve dislikes one sided trading. This is because it makes it harder for them to track hijackers and other people who steal items from people. So who is really effected by this?

Two classes of people:

1. Middle men, and 
2. People who do a lot of buying and selling of items over PayPal.

Why is this? Because middlemen generally receive an item without trading for it and then pass it on to another person who does not give anything in return. These sort of transactions raise flags at Valve because this looks like the item may be moving from a hijacked account.

As far as people who deal in big scale paypal transactions, same thing. This is because usually everything is given to another account without a return trade.

With that said, take a deep breath and relax. 

The **occasional** PayPal transaction **should not get you trade banned outright**. Usually there must be some interaction with a hijacked or stolen item.

The other way you may be trade banned, if you are a casual PayPal trader, is if you buy an item or that has been hijacked or scammed down the line. Why? Because once again, Valve will see that you accepted nothing via Steam Trade and it looks like you have scammed/received an item from a hijacked account.

**So what should you do?** Simple. Check all items before you trade, check out the seller, check out who the seller's seller and if all checks out, you *should* be okay. But what is the best practice? Always trade for in-game items.

I want to note **this is NOTHING NEW**! Back when I used to trade (like over a year ago), Valve had the exact same policy. This is nothing new, but instead it has just been realized on a wider scale.

**EDIT:** [Valve's Official Policy](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003#nottrade):


&gt; What should I not trade for?

&gt;Do not trade for anything that cannot be added into the trade window within Steam. The most common examples of these scenarios are the following: Trading items/gifts for money. You cannot add wallet credit or any form of money into the trade window. A common example of this is trading for items/gifts in return for money via PayPal.

I understand that some of you would love to trade something digitally rather than be bothered to pay $.01 at humblebundle.com. Getting a credit card # from your wallet or being bothered to remember your paypal password can be difficult, I get it. But this behavior is rooted in taking advantage of others generosity, something I think this subreddit should take issue with.

We're actively doing humble bundle a disservice. Trading is against the humble bundle terms of service, and if they cared to be dicks about it, they could deactivate the traded keys. But they aren't dicks, so the community walks all over them as if they were DRM-loving corporate suits without lawyers.

As the games are DRM free, there's no guarantee that someone paid for the keys and transmitted them solely to you; you could easily be trading for pirated goods, so humble bundle did not receive even the $.01 that was likely paid for your bundle. Furthermore, by not paying the $.01+ to humble bundle directly, they aren't recording you as a sale. These sales numbers help the company attract customers, developers and other supporters. Don't ruin a good thing!

**I propose that the subreddit agrees to stop trading humble bundle games. It skews prices, fleeces players unaware of the bundle, and takes money out of the hands of charity and indie developers.**

We currently are **requiring** you to have flair to submit trades and comment on the subreddit. We have some new back-end tools at our disposal that will make moderating easier for us. Flair being required also means no posts from people who don't leave their SteamID and don't have flair. 



**How do I update my flair?**

&gt;Go to http://trade.redditgaming.com/start and go through the two logins to receive approved submitter status on the subreddit. Once you go through this process and receive a message from SteamBot saying you're an approved submitter, you're finished completely. Simple as that!



**I already have flair, do I need to do it again through this system?** 

&gt;Yes, you'll need to go through the process once to get approved submitter status on the subreddit. 


**Can I change the steam account associated with my reddit account?**

&gt;Currently, no. The SteamID you sign up with is tied to your reddit account, so make sure you are logged into the correct accounts before you sign up for flair. 


**What is flair?**

If you haven't seen the site since the past few months, it's changed dramatically.

The auction system has been completely overhauled. I added the feature on a whim during initial development and didn't really put any effort into making it. There was no incentive to deliver on auctions and in general the feature was pretty useless. In January, I implemented the feedback system to combat non-delivery and to encourage users to use the system as it was designed to be used for. Recently, some of the rating punishments were tripled to prevent users using their collected reputation as a ""pool"" to constantly abuse the system with (although frequent offenders get warned anyway). We've also added automatically calculated starting bids recently, as it wasn't common for us to have inane starting bids as 50% of the daily report quota. Finally, Decision Time was modified to start when the auctioneer logged in so they would have no excuse to select a highest bidder.

The actions of an admin who is no longer with us inspired me to go for a system where it's hard to break rules. I have been looking over the rules and I effectively removed half of them by merging them or coding something in to make the rule redundant. You can even list quickbuys now - they'll just be completely invisible to users who enable a certain feature.

Miscellaneously, I've been fixing a ton of old bugs and grievances. The backpack.tf-based prices have been very wrong until a few weeks ago when I re-wrote the system properly (I was a bit lazy when Brad updated the API to a different format). Many other UI problems and system glitches were fixed - [see the changelog](http://bazaar.tf/changelog). We'll be updating the site's layout very soon as well.

However, we seem to be stuck in a rut where we won't get the attention of any additional users without running a raffle (try typing bazaar.tf and a space into Google). Our userbase seems to be at a standstill - it's there, however it isn't growing nor shrinking. We have been looking around and people seem to say we have the better feature set, but thousands of people, in unison, also say ""it has no userbase, so I'll go elsewhere"".

The reason I made this is because I'm partially worried people used the site during the production periods where the site was very slow due to poor caching and features weren't as great as they were, thus they think the site isn't worth the time. The site loads reasonably quickly now - I remember it taking a very long time to load, often resulting in internal errors, just because of a poorly designed backend.

So, what can I do to make you use Bazaar.tf more?

I got scammed out of my money because I got too trustworthy. I had hundreds of trades where everyone was so honest and nice. He traded, I traded, I thought I was going to make a profit and then suddenly he goes offline, trade stops and says he canceled.

Unbelievable.

This raffle wouldn't be taking place without their generosity.

______________________________________________

We've all been there, and it would be great for this hat to belong to someone who's never had the chance to rock their own unusual, but has really wanted to.  With that said, this is a raffle for **ONLY** newer players, or those who are not overly tf2-wealthy.  As simple as it sounds, it's been really hard to define exactly what that means, and I'm still not entirely sure about it.  For now, there are a couple of qualifications you must (roughly/somewhat) meet before entering:

- Currently possess no more than one earbud/unusual in your backpack .  This going to be a pretty hard thing to determine in whole, as someone could have 600 craft hats and no buds or unusuals, so ultimately wherever myself and the other guys decide to draw the line is what goes.  

- Less than 500 hours of tf2 played.  Compared to the first rule, this is *much* more flexible and those with more than 500 hours played are more than welcome to enter as well; it's more of an outline than anything.  The former is what's most important.

Please don't look too much into these as there are plenty of exceptions, but that should be a fair guideline.  If you're concerned that you might have a little too much in your BP, don't worry about it and feel free to enter regardless!

______________________________________________________

Now, to the actual raffle.  Rules are as follows:

1. Pick any number between 1-500

2. Come up with a unique number.  If two people were to pick #41, for example, the hat will go to whoever chose it first.

3. **Please do not enter if you are planning on reselling for profit.** I am putting extra emphasis on the rule this time around as I really want this hat to end up with someone who will truly appreciate it.

4. Post a link to your steam page if it's not already in your flair (this also helps with evaluating everything previously listed)

5.  Try not to downvote others - it's silly and won't increase anyone's odds of winning.

_____________________________________________________________

I may re-open the raffle a couple of different times over the next day or two depending on how long it stays on the front page.  In order for everyone to have the chance to enter, I ask that you **please upvote this for visibility purposes!!**

That should about do it.  Winner will be chosen on Friday around 12pm EST via www.random.org

Thanks and good luck to everyone!

this is why:

the only way one can acquire keys (outside of buying them from other traders) is to spend two dollars and fifty cents in the mann co store. this means we can safely assume that keys are worth 2.50.

keys = 2.50

when people trade refined for keys, they usually pay between 2.33 and 2.66 refined for a key. to save us the trouble of complicated math, I'm just going to call 1 refined a dollar.

1 refined = 1 dollar

now we get into the promos. earbuds are classically sold over paypal for somewhere between 30-35$. earbuds can also be traded for 26 keys. (what the fuck, I know) so technically speaking, earbuds are worth 65$. (mega inflation) this also means that bills that are being sold for 11 keys are worth 27.50$, which is also ridiculous. 

at the moment these are just some observations, which can tell me that key prices are really low. this makes no sense to me, because you can't craft keys or anything like that. someone is buying these keys that are eventually selling for such low prices. how does that make any sense? 

anyways, what do you guys think? 

my first suggestion would be to start selling buds for 12 keys as opposed to 26. 

12 keys = 30$

obviously people would take a price hit to start, but if everyone caught on then it would significantly reduce inflation and make unusuals and other items much more affordable.

1344067115.0,95,self.tf2trade,xnwzz,[PSA][Raffle][Giveaway] Gigantic uncrating! 500 crates!,104,9,225,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/xnwzz/psarafflegiveaway_gigantic_uncrating_500_crates/,"Steam group for upates! http://steamcommunity.com/groups/500crateunboxing

Hello, /r/tf2trade!

Being batshit insane as I am, I have decided to open 500 crates all in one go. Yes, I'm aware this is insanely expensive and I will be naught but guaranteed to lose money. Yes, I'm also aware it will take a whole lot of time and I will get carpal tunnel syndrome and die.

**I don't even care. ಠ_ಠ**

Depending on the interest, I will either do this alone on an empty server, crying softy to myself as I uncrate Strange Diamondback after Strange Diamondback, or I will set up a server specifically for people to mess around while I stand there invulnerable and livestream the whole thing!

Barring the admittedly small possibility I uncrate 500 unusuals, this venture will generate a lot of unwanted items. I'll definitely be keeping some of them in order to virtually lick my real-life money wounds, but I'm sure the vast majority I will have no use for.

So, this is a big part of where you guys come in: Free stuff! Who doesn't love free stuff?!

Commies. That's who. Filthy, dirty, freedom-hating commies. ^^^^^^^^No ^^^^^^^^offense, ^^^^^^^^brother ^^^^^^^^Russians.

&amp;nbsp;


On top of that, if by some miracle I manage to uncrate 5 unusuals (1 in 100 chance, 500 crates, so theoretically fairly possible) I will *raffle off one of my choosing :o*. I will do the same at 10, but as if that's going to happen.

Yes, it might be a cancer. Yes, I might uncrate 5 beams TCs and have to give one away. No, I do not care. I'll do that shit anyway.

Pretty cool, right?

All I ask of you guys is two things.

1. I need to gauge your interest! Let me know here if you'd be up for watching a stream of this/getting onto the server. The stream part is not quite as important, but knowing how many people want to get on the server would really help when it comes time to actually set this up.

2. **THIS IS EXTREMELY OPTIONAL AND WILL IN NO WAY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE RAFFLES OR ANYTHING ELSE!** If you're feeling generous, donations of crates and/or keys would be greatly appreciated! I'm currently sitting at:

&amp;nbsp;

    422 crates (+24! Thanks Lieutenant Huffman! +54! Thanks pragmatic[00]!) **Do not need more crates! Thanks so much!**

    396 keys

&amp;nbsp;

The crates should be no problem, but I'm not sure how long it will take me to gather the last 181 keys at a fair price (I'm Canadian; the USD conversion and fees always kill me T_T). Thus, any help would be great, as it means I can get to main the event sooner! Even a single key would be absolutely amazing of you.

*I will not be buying more than 500 keys if I get more than 500 crates.* Sorry, but I have to set a budget! However, if by some miracle I am buried in a wave of *key* donations, I will not be keeping any for myself for trading, and will obtain more crates until all the keys are used up. *Any uncrates above 500 will automatically be donated/raffled, regardless of whether I get 8 unusuals or a bunch of expensive hats/weapons from them.*

**The uncrating and raffles will happen regardless of whether or not I get donations.** I know I basically said that already but I really want to emphasize these are completely optional and I only mention them in case there are some people out there who are feeling generous.

I haven't set a date for this yet, but as soon as I have everything I need to do the actual uncrating, I will make another post to let everyone know when it will happen. Hopefully it should be early September at the very latest.

In the meantime, anyone who has any advice on setting up a server for this kind of thing, probably with novelty game-modes and the like, please get in touch with me! I've had someone offer to set up a server for this but I'd like to know what I'm doing just in case that falls through. Not putting all my eggs in one basket and all that.

Thanks guys! I look forward to (hopefully) entertaining and enriching you!

1338594697.0,95,self.tf2trade,ugfiv,"[H] A new beginning of a Hat Bank service (110+ hats) [W] You to have a look, and help you get your desired hat",113,18,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ugfiv/h_a_new_beginning_of_a_hat_bank_service_110_hats/,"After months of preparation, I have decided that today will be the first day that I open up my backpack (except my Christmas hats) and turn it into a hat / misc bank. This hat bank is exclusive to the lovely people from reddit, with the sole purpose to allow people get the hats they like by exchanging their less-liked hat between my crafting periods, since I like to craft hats if I am available soon after an update. This is the first time that I have done this, so please bear with me if the system has some flaws, and I shall fix it as soon as possible. 

*Hat / Miscs counts* - 130+   

Without further ado, let us get to the finer details :)
* I will be using the prices of hats from the spreadsheet, as I am still quite busy with uni work to keep a spreadsheet updated. http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.com.au/ 

* If the spreadsheet lists a hat with a +/-, e.g. 2+/-, I will count the value of hat as 2 ref. If it lists a hat with a price range, e.g. 1.66 - 2.00 ref, I will take the middle value of it. So the hat value will be 1.83 ref. 

* You may use your less- liked craftable hat to exchange for a hat that you like. * If you want a more valuable hat, you must also add the value difference.
 
In order to keep this hat bank always abundant with hats, I shall set the minimum value of hat to 1.44 ref if you desire to buy it with pure metal. This applies to hats with a value range of 1 - 1.33 ref. 

* A service fee of 1 scrap will be charged. Rest be assured, all the metal generated / collected will be used to purchase more hats so that this hat bank grows and benefits the reddit community. (This may be removed depending on the number of participations.)

**Some special cases:**  (only apply to my hats on sale, not your exchanged ones. i.e. I cannot pay extra if your hat has special paint or level.)

* Special level hats such as level 1, 42, 69, 99 will cost an additional 2 rec. 
* Level 100 hats will cost an additional value of 1 ref.
* The cheaper paint hats will be only an additional charge of 1 scrap.
* Hats with white paint will cost an additional of 1.5 key or 3.33 ref. 
* Hats with Slime paint will cost an additional 1 ref.
* Hats with Team Spirit will cost an additional 1 ref. 
I shall build on this list if I have other painted hats in my backpack. 

**In summary**

* for each hat, [Your hat] + [difference in value (may be 0)] + 1 scrap =&gt; [desired hat] 

* If you are buying with metal, hats with a value lower than 1.66 ref will have the service fee applied. i.e. a hat with value of 1.51 (range on spreadsheet 1.33 – 1.66 ref) will be charged 1.61 ref (which is 1 ref + 1 rec + 2 scraps + 1 weapon).  

**Hat control**

In order to keep the hat bank healthy for everyone to use, I will set the maximum number of each hat (including renamed or re described) to **3**. Once there are **3** of the **same hat** in the hat bank, the hat bank will request an additional charge of 1 scrap if you are to trade in the same hat when there are **3** in stock already (this is on top of the service fee). This hat control fee is implemented to keep the bank healthy for everybody to use. On the other hand, in order to promote the removal of these hats, service fee will not be applied to these overflowing hats (i.e. when there are 4 of them in the backpack) when exchanging a hat for them!! 


I hope that this service can help people to easily get the hats they want from my backpack with a very low fee. And once again, all the metal generated will be used to purchase more hats for people to choose! I will not add metal to my hat if your hat has more value than my hat as it will defeat the purpose of this bank. 
If you have any questions or have areas that you would like me to clarify, please ask! 
Please feel free to add me and if I am online / available, we can have a quick trade!

Open hours: subject to change, but should be till 24 hours after this post. When the time comes, it will be marked as closed. 

**FAQ:** 

 This bank includes both hats and miscs items. 

I can only accept craftable hats, and please try not to give me genuine hats as they would be wasted if they are crafted! 

I am not doing downgrades (where your hat is more valuable and converting to 2 or more cheaper hats, as the hats may have a chance to be crafted if they are not traded.

If using multiple hats to make up for the value of 1 hat, the value of the first hat will be valued as its usual value, then the second and subsequent hats will acquire a value of 1.33 ref.

1326849245.0,97,self.tf2trade,olp2j,I just got my TF2 Secret Santa gift. All I can say is: Holy shit,113,16,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/olp2j/i_just_got_my_tf2_secret_santa_gift_all_i_can_say/,"After being shafted from my first original TF2 secret santa (who got banned and reported to steamrep cause he didn't want to deliver), our awesome tf2trade mod rolmos matched me with someone...rather unique.

His name was just /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa. He added me earlier and kept increasing the suspense by talking about preparing my gift and all that.

So after about 10-15 minutes, he said the following:

12:29 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: TIIIIIIIIIIME FOR PRESENTSSSSSS

He opened the trade. I wondered what he would get me. I'm pretty sure he knew my favorite class was demoman, so I expected something demoman related, but you never know.

And then he started adding fists.

Strange Fists. Everywhere.

In fact, he added a total of 50 strange fists, along with a backpack expander. I was absolutely amazed because it was nothing that I was expecting. 

Here's a part of the chat that went on:


12:35 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: Right then


12:35 AM - [ewe] Alpay: Trading ingame or?


12:35 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: ahaha


12:35 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: you'll see why we can't do that in a second


12:35 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: Anyways


12:35 AM - [ewe] Alpay: ...what


12:36 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: I couldn't get the normal gift I got for my other santas because you already had one of the sort of gifts I gave out to others


12:36 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: So I thought i'd give you a nice, but different gift instead


12:37 AM - [ewe] Alpay: As you say


12:37 AM - [ewe] Alpay: ...oh my god


12:37 AM - [ewe] Alpay: SO YOU'RE THE GUY WHO GATHERED THE FISTS


12:37 AM - [ewe] Alpay: good lord


12:37 AM - [ewe] Alpay: it doesn't end does it


12:38 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: Don't worry I got you a backpack expander


12:38 AM - [ewe] Alpay: ...wow


12:38 AM - [ewe] Alpay: This is just..


12:38 AM - [ewe] Alpay: wow


12:39 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: Should be all 50


The best thing about this gift? It was just a disguise. Right after completing the trade, he said that he forgot to add something, and re-initiated a new trade. I mention that I correctly got 51 items (50 fists + 1 expander), but still accepted the trade.

12:40 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: The fists were a disguise!



And then he added 2 games: Trine 2 and Just Cause 2. I -really- wanted Trine 2 (couldn't afford it though), so the gift was perfect. Just Cause 2 also was on my wishlist, for which I am also genuinely happy.

I'm really happy about the gifts that I received (inb4 fisting jokes). Even though my original secret santa decided not to deliver, this mysterious and very generous TF2Trade Secret Santa made my day. Thanks a lot mate!

I would've posted on [/r/tf2gifts](/r/tf2gifts) but there aren't too many readers there and I was told it would be better if I posted here.

Introducing Mist - a portable, open-source Steam client that lets you chat with friends and trade TF2 items anywhere!",112,18,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1ahkc3/psa_take_your_trading_with_you_wherever_you_go/,"###What is Mist?###
Mist is a portable, open-source Steam client written in C# that allows the user to chat and trade TF2 items.
Mist is something I decided to write because I love doing trades, even away from home. Unfortunately I wasn't always able to go on Steam and trade due to restrictions on installing software, for example, and would miss out on business deals.  
So Mist is intended to be a solution for that. It's portable and doesn't require Steam, which means that you can put it on a flash drive and bring it anywhere with you.  
Mist is built on top of SteamBot (https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/) and heavily uses its underlying functions to handle chat and trading. And of course, it is open-source as well :)  
Scroll to the bottom for the source-code and download link.

###Features###

**MIST IS STILL VERY MUCH IN BETA.** Expect bugs, and also expect them to be fixed as they are reported. With your help, I'll be able to get it as stable as possible. I wouldn't recommend it for high-value, important trades at the moment, just to be on the safe side.

[Screenshots Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Lwlwc)

* Works with SteamGuard - no need to disable it to use Mist  
* Chat with friends  
* Trade TF2 items - you are limited to trading only TF2 items for now. Adding other types of items will cause the trade to expire.  
* Change display name and status  
* Add friends  
* Block/ignore friends  
* Backpack viewer - view anyone's backpack directly from within the program!  
* SteamRep Checker - check any of your friends' SteamRep status  
* More to come?  

###What doesn't work###

* Friend requests are not shown in Mist. You will have to accept/ignore them manually via steamcommunity.com. This feature will be implemented in a later release  
* Can only trade TF2 items  
* Occasionally adding items will cause the trade to crash and expire. This is rare but it happens. Close the chat tab, reopen it and trade the other person again.  
* Searching for friends - this is planned for a later release  
* **Linux support** - unfortunately Mist is not compatible with Linux, using either Mono or Wine. Some of the libraries used are incompatible. A separate Linux release is planned in the future, if demand is high enough.

1320004314.0,95,self.tf2trade,luc4d,So you want to buy or sell an item for cash! Here's a guide!,109,14,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/luc4d/so_you_want_to_buy_or_sell_an_item_for_cash_heres/,"Congratulations! You have gained enough experience to begin buying and selling virtual items for real money! Here's an entirely too long guide I tossed up to help you on your way. If you're confused, just PM me!

## ***Where to start: appraise your item! Please note: we will be using USD as the base currency.***

*****

Whether you're hoping to sell a single refined metal or a handful of top-tier unusual hats, your item has a couple of different values to keep in mind: item value and cash value.

**Item value** is determined by using certain key components of the TF2 item universe as units of currency. The units of currency and their relative values is as follows:

&gt;* Refined metal -- one refined, 3 reclaimed metal, 9 scrap metal
&gt;* Mann Co Supply Crate Key -- 2.44 - 2.55 refined
&gt;* Bill's Hat -- 20 - 25 refined, or 9 - 11 keys 
&gt;* Mac OSX Earbuds -- ~52 - 55 refined or ~24 keys
&gt;* Unusual hats -- At worst, one earbud or 22 keys or 55 refined or LESS. At most, 97+ earbuds.

These item prices are fluid, and change almost daily. You have to keep an eye on market trends! Places like /tf2trade, [TF2 Trading Post](http://www.tf2tp.com), [TF2 Outpost](http://tf2outpost.com), and trade servers (RUGC trade, anyone?) are great places to keep up on the average item price of other items.

**Cash value,** however, is not a direct translation of item value, but it's a close approximation. We use the value of the smaller forms of currency to help us price the value of larger forms. A lot of times, you will see earbuds going for $32, but 60 (refined) x $0.6 = $36. You can usually buy items from the cash market for less than in-game because you cut out the work involved with converting (buds, in this example) items into smaller forms of currency to sell. It is best to visit [SourceOP.com's item buying/selling subforum](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewforum&amp;f=21) in order to stay on top of current market price. 

&gt;* Refined metal -- $0.40 - $0.50
&gt;* Mann Co Supply Crate Key -- $1.15 - 1.35
&gt;* Bill's Hat -- $11 - $13
&gt;* Mac OSX Earbuds -- $30 - $35
&gt;* Unusual hats -- Anywhere from ~$15 to ~~$1500 (maybe even more!)~~ (a burning Team Captain sold for what amounts to $1500 cash + 2500 in unusuals, and again later for $2500+ in cash)

Appraising an unusual hat is a sometimes confusing task, because there are seemingly arbitrary rules regarding hierarchy of classes, hats, and particle effects. The following is a **rough** look at how each class and effect falls, from least-desired to most-desired. For brevity's sake, we will leave out the complete list of hats. This is not a catch-all! There are plenty of instances in which these hierarchies will fail! ***When in doubt, ask an admin, and then ask a few more!***

*Least-desirable -- Heavy --&gt; Spy --&gt; Engineer --&gt; Sniper --&gt; Pyro --&gt; Demoman --&gt; Medic --&gt; Scout --&gt; Soldier -- most-desirable*

*Least-valuable -- Logo --&gt; Confetti --&gt; Peace --&gt; Nutz and Bolts --&gt; Flies --&gt; Bubbles --&gt; Searing Plasma--&gt; Orbiting Planets --&gt; Orbiting Fire --&gt; Steaming --&gt; Smoking --&gt; Vivid Plasma --&gt; Cauldron Bubbles --&gt; Blizzardy Storm --&gt; Flaming Lantern --&gt; Haunted Ghosts --&gt; Eerie Orbiting Fire --&gt; Circling Heart --&gt; Stormy Storms --&gt; Energy --&gt;  Scorching Flames --&gt;  Sunbeams --&gt; Cloudy Moon --&gt; Burning Flames -- most-valuable*

Please note that this effect tier is basically meaningless because there are so many exceptions. The main thing I want you to take away from the tier system is that there are low, mid, high, and top-tier effects.

On average, Soldier hats will be the most expensive, but the hat is really the main determinant of value! The Exquisite Rack is the lowest Soldier hat, and in confetti or nutz, can be acquired for 1 buds or even less! As each slider moves further and further to the right, hats get vastly more expensive per tier. Google is your friend here. Here's what I type in when I want a very specific unusual hat price checked

I get lots of results of people trading and/or selling their Madame Dixies with burning flames, so I have a good reference point for

## ***PHASE TWO: Listing your item!***

*****

We will cover what the two types of threads should look like, **buying** and **selling.**

* Buying, or want threads, are relatively straightforward. [Here is a good example of a clean, simple buying thread.](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=86972) The only thing I could think to criticize would be his profile link, which goes to his /id/xxxxx page, and not his /profiles/###### page, which is much preferred.

A ""rep thread"" is used to list your former transactions and how you are trustworthy not to perform any funny business over Paypal or in game. Creating a rep thread on SourceOP by following the instructions listed there will allow you to keep track of purchases. Always make sure to ask people to leave you feedback when you buy an item! [Here's mine!](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=76672&amp;highlight=)

* Selling threads are not too complicated either. Register for SourceOP.com, SPUF, UTC, MannCoTrading, and whatever other sites you find will allow you to list. Your thread should [look like this](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=86518).

## ***So someone made you an offer you like! Time to buy or make a sale.***

*****

There are a couple of things you should do before going any further.

1. Set up a Paypal account to be able to send and receive money. Verify it, if need be. I have not recently set up a new account, but the steps are easy to follow.

2. Check your buyer or seller's SteamID on the SteamRep.com database. If they have been discovered as a scammer or otherwise unsavory individual, they will have either a ""Caution"" tag or a ""Scammer"" tag. I do not recommend dealing with either, as you are taking a big risk, and if you knowingly deal with a scammer, there is a chance that you will get a scammer tag yourself!

3. Verify that the person who has expressed interest is who they say they are. Ask for a PM from the user's rep thread, probably on SourceOP. Copy and paste the Steam ID from the rep thread back into your browser and compare the hours of TF2 played. If there is a discrepancy, cancel the deal and walk away!

4. If you end up using one, check the middleman's SteamID on SteamRep to make sure they are who they say they are! Plenty of users have gotten ""team scammed"" by people posing as reputable buyers, sellers, and middlemen. Ask for proof via forum PM, if need be.

*****

* Buying an item when you have little to no rep means you will likely need a middleman, which is never a bad practice. Finding a middleman is easy. SteamRep has a list of trusted middlemen, some mods of this subreddit (myself included) are fair game, and members of invite-only Steam groups, like [UTC Admins](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/utcadmins) are good to use. Some may charge a nominal fee for their services, while most do not ask for anything. Once you and your business partner have agreed upon a middleman, the seller gives the MM the item(s) to hold until you have sent money over Paypal or Moneypak. When sending money over Paypal, make sure to send the money as a ""gift,"" so that it is non-refundable on your end. Unless you have a ton of rep, sellers will require this step anyway. If they receive money as anything but a gift, they will refund it and ask for gift payment. Once the money has been sent and confirmed by the seller, the middleman sends you your item(s) and you either tip or not, depending on how generous you feel. Exchange rep threads, leave positive feedback, and you're done! However, *do not mess around with Paypal chargebacks*. You will get caught, and it *is* a form of fraud. It is exceedingly stupid to risk jail over virtual items, and yes, people have gone to jail for it.

* Selling an item means you don't have to have as much rep, but buyers will more often seek you out if you have a lot of transactions in your history because you can be trusted to send the item over *without* the introduction of a middleman. It is still always GOOD PRACTICE to use a middleman for any cash deal, however. 
The two most common ways to receive money as a seller are Paypal and Moneypak, and only one is completely safe for you. Paypal is quicker and easier, and most people will prefer it, especially for transactions under $100. However, if you are unsure about a buyer's reputation (not many forum posts, only a little feedback, etc), request that the buyer (USA only, I think) use a MoneyPak card. Moneypak cards can be ""charged up,"" like a pre-paid credit card, by going to a vendor, such as Wal-Mart, CVS, Walgreens, or others, finding the card near the checkout, telling the cashier how much you want on it, then paying for it. On the back of the card is a code which must be scratched off to be revealed. The buyer will give you the code, which can be input on [Moneypak's website](http://moneypak.com) using the ""Add funds to Paypal"" button. Once you have input the code and sent the money from the card to your account (you will receive a confirmation e-mail and money in your account), it is now time to send the item over to the buyer, and the transaction is complete.
It is customary to knock off a portion of the price for the inconvenience of this method, but you are **guaranteed safety,** as the buyer cannot charge that money back on you! Leave your buyer some good feedback, as this is an annoying process for most buyers, and they deserve a pat on the back for giving you not only money, but peace of mind.

**At this point, you are finished! You have bought or sold an item for real dollars, and it feels *good.* Congratulate yourself, because you just beat one of the harder stages of the Internet.

1313270926.0,93,self.tf2trade,jhyte,Common Trade Scams and How to Avoid Them,100,7,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jhyte/common_trade_scams_and_how_to_avoid_them/,"With any economy, there are always those looking to feed on the greed and innocence of others through unsavory trickery. Scamming is a pretty frequent occurrence on the tf2 trade scene. Many have fallen victims to some basic scams due to their inexperience. Below are some of the commonly seen scams and tricks that you can avoid while trading.


**1.The straight up lie. (semi-scam)**


This only works when the victim has no idea of values, Some one sees you wearing that pretty max head, or that freshly unboxed unusual. They add you/trade you and tell you they would like whatever it is you have. They through up a couple of Strange weapons and tell you that they are super rare and you can level them up and it is a totally fair deal. 

You can avoid this simply by asking someone for a price check on tf2trade or in server. People will tell you that such a trade is extremely one sided and you should avoid it. 


**2. The more than 8 trade**


This is when someone offers more than 8 items for whatever you have. For example I promise you 3 v hats 13 weapons and 2 paints for your earbuds. These items won't fit inside a single ingame trade window. However the guy seems quite nice and chatty so You think sure he will give me the rest of the items after i make the first trade. However they will instant delete you after the first trade is done and you never see them again. Valve doesn't care, because it was a ""fair trade"". 

To avoid this, either use the trade beta in chat trading which allows for more than 8 items, or use a trusted middleman. to hold all of the items for the trade. You can always do a background check on the person proposing the trade through steamrep.  Or simply do not do trades that have more than 8 items tell him to upconvert his stuff.


**3. The Rename Scam**


This was particularly popular during the early days of trading when the trade system was not fully scam conscience. People would rename billycocks into modests (there's a huge difference in value if the hat was unusual). People would rename their weapons to include qualities (vintage, genuine, strange). Some people would rename default spy pistol to BIG KILL and since a lot of people have never seen either items in a trade window they assume it's the real item.

This scam is now obsolete due to the fact that if you hover over an item in a trade window it will clearly indicate that it has been renamed. You can also distinguish between qualities of items by turning on item quality color in your backpack. Purple are unusuals, green are genuine, blue are vintages.


**4. DO NOT CLICK ON THAT LINK scam.** 


This is a very common phishing technique, one of your friends will send you a link which says ""OMG can you believe what they are saying about you on the forums? www.somethingthatlookslikeasteamcommunitylink.com You click on it thinking which MOFO is shittalking me, and you are lead to a page that looks like a steam community log in page asking for your login and password. If you check the address bar it is not a HTTPS. If you put your info in, it will just jump to some random page that has nothing to do with anything. Now some devious hacker out there has your account information and password. They can buy shit from the store if you have your CC info saved, they will clear out everything in your pack. 

How to avoid this, do not use the same password for your email and steam, do not let others know what your email account is unless you know them in real life (this can be obtained by asking for a paypal address). Do NOT click on random links sent to you over steam chat. DO NOT put in your login info to any website that is not HTTPS. You should not keep your billing info in your steam account saved, since that's invitation for some serious ID theft. Having steam guard turned on also helps against this kind of scams. Lastly Do not Rage on that friend who sent you that link, he's not the scammer, he probably did the same thing as you and clicked on a dumb link and scammers got his account too. 


**5. The Impersonator Scam**


There are established traders in each trading community. These people have Reputation of being straight and honest and trustworthy. When dealing with such traders it is common practice to trust them and give them the items first before they send you that paypal cash or that multi trade. These traders will ALWAYS have a public profile, a very loaded backpack (multi unusuals, loads of keys refined etc), and most importantly 500+hours on their tf2 time at least. Impersonators will copy a trusted traders profile down to the last detail and approach you   saying they are interested in buying something from you. They will claim to have a lot of REP so that you should go first in the trade. You look at the rep thread they gave you and think, wow the dude's legit. So you send him your max head/earbuds/unusual but the paypal cash never comes.

To avoid impersonators, you must check their profile closely. How many hours of tf2 do they have? How many friends? What does his backpack look like? Do not trust any link that he gives you, instead look up all this information through his profile/steam id. Private profile = instant redflag, empty backpack and low hours and low friends are other indicators. In the rep thread that they provide you there's usually a link the the real steam profile of the trusted trader, if you click on that and that person is not on your friendslist then you are dealing with an impersonator. 

To avoid impersonators, you simply check their profile/steamid against steamrep, look at their profile carefully, and check their backpack. Power traders/ trusted sellers will RARELY approach someone for a purchase, these people are connected, why would they add you randomly and offer to buy your stuff? 


**6. Fake Middleman, impersonator Variant.**


Some one wants to buy one of your hats for lots of money, or wants to sell you one of their hats for cheap. You check their profile, and backpack and everything seems ok, you ask them for rep they tell you they don't really have any. So they suggest a middleman, and you think to yourself, if he suggested a middleman that means he's legit and not trying to scam me. So suddently another person with a trusted name and profile joins the steam chat. You have heard this person on all the trade servers ""DB, Hamstar. Trell, Fildy, Blackened, Cloudy"", it will be the name of a trusted middleman. He will talk you through the process, and how he will hold that valuable item until both party confirms the sending/recieving of paypal payment. As soon as you trade the middleman your stuff though, both of them disappears and you will never get your money. 


This is a 2 person scam, the middleman is fake, careful examination of their profile/backpack will show obvious discrepancies. To avoid such a scam, find your OWN MIDDLEMAN on a trade server. These scams usually prey on the greed of the people. If someone offers you 40usd for your earbuds, which are only worth 18, you might think YAY my lucky day, instead you will be down 18. If it's too good to be true, it probably is a scam. Steam Rep check both the buyer/seller and the middleman. 


**7.Swap Scam, bait and switch**


Someone approaches you with your dream unusual, and they want some of your unusual/promos/cash. they start a trade with you, and they put up that SUNBEAMS KABUTO in the trade window, your heart skips a beat, you hover over the hat to confirm it is indeed what it is. You are excited and is willing to comply with every demand of the other person. You throw up your 400 dollar unusuals along with 100 dollar worth of promos, the other person will keep on asking for different things, aka throw in a refined, a key, no i don't want that change that to a paint. They will try their best to distract you will you are busy looking for stuff in your backpack. Finally the other person says yes, and you click on trade. However when you open up your backpack, its now a FLIES KABUTO, and you just wasted 500 dollars on a 50 dollar hat. How did this happen?

Amidst all the haggling and him keeping you busy, he swapped the hats out while you were distracted, the trader does indeed have a sunbeams kabuto, and a flies kabuto. While you are eagerly trying to get him to do the trade by complying to his demands, he has switched the goods on you. When he finally says ok, you are too excited to double check and made the mistake of being scammed.

To avoid this scam, you need to be cool headed. when you click on ready to trade, always hover over the unusual to confirm the effect is correct before you hit the trade button. If they other person is making you do many things and trying to distract you, you should be extra cautious. If the other person is losing value in a trade with you, you should question why. If there are multiple unusuals of the same hat different effects in their backpack you should be cautious. Check their steamrep profile. 


**8.Fake paypal email scam**


Someone just approached you inquiring about your unusual, they are willing to buy it for 300 dollars. They do not have rep and they will say, I am willing to go first because I trust you! Give me your paypal address. So you supply them with your email address and voila your email notification informs you that SCAMER X has sent you 300 dollars to your account. You open the email up and it seems legit. So you go in game and trade the item. 3 Days later when you want to use that 300 dollars to buy something online, you realize that paypal never received 300 dollars. That paypal notification email was fake. 

It was sent from a spoofing account with the name PAYPAL, the actual email address will be something completely non paypal related, or sometimes it will be from poypal or payaI. To avoid this scam simply check paypal payments by login into your paypal to confirm. 


**9. The backcharge/dispute paypal scam**


In tf2 trading world, the only accepted form of payment is PAYPAL personal GIFT. Do not accept paypal payments of any other form, They can all be easily disputed. You will need to hover over the payment and look at it's details, if it says payment for goods. You need to refund it and say I only accept personal gift. Sometimes people really forgot to click personal gift, other times they are trying to pull a fast one on your and get your hat then dispute that 800 dollar payment for a virtual good. 

*Buyers from certain regions have no access to Personal Gift option, it is up to you and the reputation of the person you are dealing with whether or not you want to proceed with the sales. 


**COMMON RESOURCES TO COMBAT SCAMMERS**

www.steamrep.com scammers are redflaged. 

www.sourceop.com has a great forum section with a giant sticky for scammers, using their forum search function you can quickly find out if the person chatting you up is a scamming sob. 

www.google.com just put in their steamid not profile, and if they have been flagged before then you will know. 

www.steamidfinder.com Profile link can be easily changed, steamid on the other hand is like a Social Insurance Number, it sticks with the account.

&gt;Your time is valuable, and the fact that you choose to spend it on Team Fortress 2 is awesome. When we introduced the Item Drop System back in 2009, one of our goals was to reward you for spending your time with us.

&gt;We recently made a change that helps ensure players are playing TF2, not just leaving their computers on in order to get item drops. As of last week, players can no longer receive item drops unless they are actively playing the game.

&gt;As with any update, this change is meant to keep the game as fair, fun, and rewarding to as many players as possible. We will continue to examine how the Item Drop System is used, and make any adjustments as needed to benefit the players.

&gt;Questions and Answers:

&gt;What is the definition of “actively playing” Team Fortress 2?

&gt;From an item drop perspective, a player is considered to be actively playing if they meet all of the following criteria:

&gt;Is connected to a VAC secured server.

&gt;Is responding to in-game drop notifications while not utilizing external programs to do so.

&gt;Is running only one instance of the game.

&gt;Is not in textmode.

&gt;A player who meets all of those criteria is earning time towards random item drops (subject to the weekly cap).

&gt;Will I be VAC banned for not actively playing the game, also known as ‘idling’?

&gt;No, you will not be banned for just idling. You may be banned if you use external programs to circumvent idle detection. See VAC FAQ.

&gt;Will I lose my drops if I'm idling? Will it affect my weekly drop cap?

&gt;No, drops are not lost and the drop cap remains unaffected. Players will simply have their item drops paused. Item drops will return when normal play is resumed.

&gt;Why are you changing how the Item Drop System works?

&gt;This change is designed to make the TF2 experience equally rewarding for all players. The previous system had flaws that allowed players to collect rewards without actively playing TF2.

&gt;I don’t idle. How does this impact me?

&gt;The new system ensures you won’t become disadvantaged for playing TF2 the way you always have.",,False,,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,t3_1ij2tk,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1ij2tk/psa_valve_has_issued_a_public_statement_regarding/,

Please note, I and the other admins will **never** randomly add anyone. If, for whatever reason we do - confirm that it is really one of us. Do the following steps:


1. From the message box, click on the drop down box in the corner and click ""View Profile""

2. Right click on the steam profile

3. Click ""copy URL""

4. Go to [www.steamrep.com](http://steamrep.com/)

5. Paste the URL into the box.

6. You will see green text saying [Reddit Admin](http://steamrep.com/index.php?id=scalia)


***

Always, always, always do this before you trade with anyone. It will save so much pain later. 

Also, please make sure that you report impersonators to our Scammer list on the sidebar. Be sure to capture their Steam ID otherwise there is not much we can do. 

The **FIRST THING** you should do when ANYONE asks you to trade, middleman, or talks to you about trading is to do the above steps. This way you can report them.

***
**BEST PRACTICES**

1. Always add moderators through their Steam Flair - the safest way to do this is to click on their name in the sidebar and find a post within the /r/tf2trade subreddit. An alternative way to add moderators is to go to the [Steam Community](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rugctrade) page and add one of the administrators there.

2. Always check the person you are trading with through Steam Rep using the above procedure

3. Keep copies of Steam IDs of people you are potentially going to trade with

4. ALWAYS check the steam ID of the person offering to middle man

5. Never accept a random middle man. Get one from Steam Rep's trusted middle men or a moderator/admin from here. Add **us** by clicking the link on SteamRep. 

6. Always be cautious of random adds. They may not be who they purport to be.

Whether it would be with an injection scam, which a PSA was made explaining it by The Cynical Cool Bean a few days back, straight up ol' middleman impersonation, or just ""lol i trust you cuz u redditor.""

Please guys, I must urge you to take precautions and protect yourselves from losing any of your hard earned TF2 items. Please take the time to check out the person who you are trading with via [steamrep](http://steamrep.com/). Plug in their community profile link, make sure they are clean first off. Check their hours, check their reddit account for how long they've been around, and their karma. Make sure you aren't just trading with an account that was made yesterday, both steam and reddit. 

I've been getting reports of people being scammed by **people who are already marked on steamrep as a scammer, or impersonator.** This can be totally avoided by checking their steamrep! Don't fall victim to this! Don't trade with them! If you do, **you run the risk of being marked on steamrep as a scammer for TRADING with a known scammer!**

When trading with paypal, make sure that the rep profile they give you is actually theirs! Verify via PM on sourceop, PM via reddit, steamrep them! Not enough rep? Urge them to use a [/r/tf2trade](/r/tf2trade) mod as a middleman, or an [official middleman from steamrep.](http://steamrep.com/list/M) Then verify that it's actually said middleman via previous methods that were mentioned. Be safe guys. Don't lose dem purples. (or buds, or whatever you are trading.)

**tl;dr:** avoid being scammed, avoid qq, check steamrep/steam profile/reddit account.

------------------------------------------------------------

###PSA and Raffle #2

------------------------------------------------------------

For those who missed the announcement yesterday, here it is again! Plus another raffle, with slightly better prizes!

You may know me from [an announcement I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ws4ye/psa_come_join_the_community_trade_server_where/) last week about setting up a new trade server, focusing on trading with a sense of community.

It hasn't been that popular, but it has gotten a fair amount of people occasionally. So I got to thinking, ""how can I help make my trade server more popular, and have more people join, and hopefully come back regularly?"" 

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, I decided to organize an event, hosted on my trade server, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His partner?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday, 12 PM PST**, I will be hosting an epic battle on my server! I call it: ""The Huntsman and the Spy"". 

---------------------------------

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers, and 7 spies.

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map, but spies are allowed.

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!), and the goal of each sniper will be to use their Huntsman to take out enemy snipers on the other side of the map. Your spy partner can either hang around you to protect you from enemy spies, or they can choose to sneak their way across the map and backstab enemy snipers. 

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats, until there are 3 semi-finalist teams on Red and Blu. 

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, the last team standing on Red or Blu will move to the final round. In the second round, the semi-finalists must keep battling until there is a winner on the team that did not win the first time (e.g. If a team on Blu won the first time, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round, the two teams must go head to head with each other. Sniper vs sniper, with both spies trying to protect their sniper and take out the other sniper and spy. The first sniper to die will cause their team to lose.

And that's it for the rules!

I will be announcing the grand prizes (one for the Sniper and one for the Spy, along with the prizes for each of the round winners) tomorrow. The grand prizes are both worth a couple keys each, and *if people are kind enough to donate*, the winners will get even more cool stuff! 

#**If you are interested in registering for this tournament, please fill out this fancy form [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHVOTVg0a21VdFJMN09BTm1nYlZrRnc6MQ). You MUST have a partner to be your Spy or Sniper before you can enter (only one of you needs to fill out the form)! So tell a buddy or an online friend about this. :) It is up to you to decide who will be who.**

The list of competitors will be announced on **~~Wednesday~~ Thursday**, along with the team that they will be on, so check back for the post! Join my Steam group as well [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CommunityTrade) so you'll know when I make the announcement!

Now, onto...

I am now in the midst of exams and a thought came to me in the shower this morning. I realized that I waste far to much of my time trading instead of enjoying TF2 as a game. Please help me fight my addiction, I put far to much time/effort into trading when I really should be putting it into my course work and family. 



Backpack.tf states my backpack to be worth over $200. I am willing to let it go for around ~~$180US~~ **$140US**, but I am open to every and all offers. I have to sell my BP as a whole so please don't offer on singular items.



Now you're all probably wondering what is in my BP... Here are a few of the more ""pricey"" items:

* Unusual Flipped Trilby (Steaming)
* Unusual Stout Shako (Bubbling)
* Menpo #30 (craft)
* ~~Freedom Staff #39 (craft)~~
* Vintage Ullapool Caber
* Strange Holy Mackerel (crit/low health/domination parts)
* Strange Mantreads



If you are reading this and it doesn't appeal to you, may I please ask for an upboat because I need this to be sold (I hate asking for attention -.-). Please feel free to ask any questions that concern you. Thanks for your time Redditors !!



**[EDIT] I have been convinced by my mates on steam to stay within the community. Because of this I feel obliged to keep a small proportion of my BP. I have worked out that the items I would like to keep cost $37-/+. I am now looking for offers around $140. Sorry for the throw around fellas.**

So you might be wondering why we didn't do a raffle on Monday, and that's because StagMan and I have decided to switch these to Fridays. This will make preparing for these raffles, as well as doing them, much more bearable as my Monday time is slowly dwindling away, as is StagMan's. 

Have no fear, though! We'll keep doing these as long as the reddit community appreciates it. I mean, seriously, who doesn't love free TF2 items?

(eg: sending bad funds on paypal and making off with your hat)

* **Shark**: Someone who looks for people who dont know their prices in order to buy at a very low price, or sell at a high one (eg: Ill buy your bills for 1 ref)

* **Lowball**: When someone offers a lot lower than what its worth, fully knowing its actual price.

* **B/O**: Short for ""Buyout"", what someone will take immeditely for their hat, usually higher than normal price but saves you from having to bid with others

* **C/O**: Short for ""Current Offer"", highest/best offer so far, what your trying to beat.

* **Quicksell**: When a seller tries to sell something quickly by selling it for much lower than what its worth. 

* **Rep**: Short for reputation, used mainly in trading for money, or other items that steamtrade cant do. If you scam your rep plunges, doing things to gain trust makes it go up. 

* **Sweets**: Something small to even out a deal.

* **PC**: Short for ""Price Check"" asking others what they think the price of said item is.

* **Cancer**: A hat or effect not many people like and is therefor very hard to sell.

* **Downgrading**: Often used in unusual trading, usually referring to making a hat worse (eg: if you have an unusual bucket helm with vivid plasma, you could downgrade it to flies and get some currency out of someone wanting to upgrade their effect)

* **ScrapBanking**: When someone (the scrapbanker) trades scrap metal for 2 weapons, usually to sell them later for 1 scrap each.

* **Vanilla**: Original items.

* **Dirty/Clean**: Dirty has something making it bad. In normal hats usually means store bought and therefore uncraftable and is only half as valuable as its clean counterpart. In higher trading could mean gifted or duped. Lower value here as well. Clean means not dirty.

* **Spycrabbing**: A form of gambling where people put up equal wagers (if higher than 8 keys in worth to a middleman), the players then switch to spy, switch to the disguise kit and taught until one person does the spycrab taunt 3 times, that player is out. The last spy standing wins the pot of wagers. If higher than 25 keys in worth please tip your middleman :)

* **STORES**: Tf2mm- Team Fortress 2 Metal Market. TF2WH - Team Fortress 2 Ware House. TF2OP - TF2 Outpost. TF2TP - Team Fortress 2 Trading Post.

**CURRENCY**

* **Buds**: Short for Earbuds, was a promotional item for playing tf2 on a mac way back when. Equals about 24 keys (this is disputed)

* **Bills**: Promotional item for L4D, equals about 8 keys or .33 buds; 10 keys if painted white or black.

* **Keys**: Orginal purpos is to open crates re purposed for currency. Equals ABOUT 2.55 ref (this is very disputed)

* **Ref**: Short for Refined Metal, equals 3 rec

* **Rec**: Short for reclaimed metal, equals 3 scrap

* **Scrap**: Equals 2 random weapons

* **Crates**: Unless new, salvaged, or a special number equals about 1/4.

Details inside.",106,24,181,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ohgv7/the_mann_conomy_is_currently_in_a_state_of_hyper/,"Many people have commented about this being a bad economy to sell unusuals at the moment and that it will get better soon. Unfortunately I do not believe this is so, and in fact, this is going to get worse. The price of promos, keys, refined metal, and Unusuals have become decoupled from what they are worth and the market is starting to reflect this. Here’s why:

Keys being used as currency are part of the problem. What is hard to acquire? Ref, Unusuals, and promos. If one wanted, they could simply go into the store and purchase a butt-load of keys, injecting them from nowhere. Metal is created at a constant rate controlled by Valve, and one cannot simply “purchase” metal out of thin air. Promos are even rarer, there is a **VERY** small of them amongst the ever increasing player base. Unusuals, however, are the reason this has all come about. They used to be valued SO high because they were rare and desired. But as more and more keys are bought out of thin air, more and more unusuals are flooding the market, driving the price down exponentially. Why? The amount of promos is **NOT** increasing, the amount of everything else is!

Now, the typical arrogant gamer here can’t believe his beautiful Flies Ushanka is worth anything less than the 3 buds he demands (ha!) and he simply holds it. He won’t sell and holds on to an Unusual that is worth less and less as days go by. (This is assuming demand for Unusuals, not desirability of one). So we are left with inflated prices of Unusuals that people will NOT part with their valuable promos for. Fewer promos on the market causes their price to increase faster than the market realizes. 
So where does that leave us? The prices are still wildly changing but in my opinion are nowhere near the spreadsheet values. In the past 2 weeks alone, the key:bud ratio on the sheet has increased from 20:1 to 24:1, *a ~17% change in a very short amount of time*. That’s the sheet value mind you. I personally wouldn’t dream of selling my buds at 24 keys. Keys on the market can be had for as low as $1.40. But the amount of keys on the market is skyrocketing, while the buds are not. 

What are things worth? I don’t know, all I know is, I’m holding onto my buds and bills while this Unusual deflation/promo inflation sorts itself out. In the end, I DO know that 1) Promos are going to be worth **A LOT** more **VERY** soon and 2) Unusuals are worth less promos by the day.

**The Reason**

Finally got the last of my dream items and decided to pass on the happiness to all you wonderful folks here at r/tf2trade!

*edit* since a couple people have asked, the final dream item was the sparkle lugermorph :)
________

**The Prizes**

* First place : Black Bills
* Second place : Unpainted Essential Accessories

[](/ppcute ""can you see me? if so leave an emote of your fav pony in your comment and you'll be entered in the soooooper secret secondary raffle. The prize is flair with an included decal tool! Will also include making the flair in full color if you don't know how :)"")

___
**The Rules**

1. Pick a number between 0001-1000. **BEFORE YOU CHOOSE A NUMBER CTRL+F TO SEE IF THE NUMBER HAS ALREADY BEEN CHOSEN!**

2. Please leave the numbers you choose in a 4 digit format. (examples 1=0001, 31=0031,  420=0420) This will make it easier for me to find the winner if it's a lower number. **If you do not leave your number in this format it will automatically disqualify you.**

3. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE! YOU MUST HAVE FLAIR TO ENTER THIS RAFFLE. This is non negeotiable. Don't have flair? [Then what are you waiting for ya dingus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/katuk/good_news_everybody_you_can_now_have_a_link_to/)

4. Please upvote this for visibility. I get no karma.

**The One**


I'm leaving this raffle open for about 14 hours overnight while I sleep. Might be 1-2 hours off depending on when I wake up :3 When I wake up I will be choosing a winner through [Random.org](http://www.random.org/)

If someone has chosen the same number as you and that number wins, then the person who chose first will be the winner. But **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE** check before you choose a number. If enough time has passed to the point where I can't discern which came first I'll be entering the names of both of you into a random generator and choosing that way.

5. Post your steam page if it's not already in your flair (much easier to get in contact that way).

By the way, whoever gets the key and crate has to open it for me to bare witness.  Both because I don't want anyone to pull any sneaky tricks, and because I want to see you fail at my expense.

Hey all! As some of you may be aware, we do an annual /r/tf2trade [secret santa event](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/njxqm/a_rtf2trade_christmas_announcing_our_very_own/) - and we need to stress-test the bot that will handle your entries and eventually matching you up to a giftee/secret santa.


To help stress test us the bot we need you to do the following:

**1)** Send a [message to Steambot (click here)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Steambot&amp;subject=Secret%20Santa) with ""Secret Santa"" as the subject and your SteamID64 as the message. Please make sure your SteamID64 does **not** have a forward slash (/) at the end of it.  

**2)** Follow the instructions the almighty Steambot sends you. 

**3)** That's it! If you encounter any bugs, please post them here. 

-----
**HOW TO GET YOUR STEAMID64:**

* Go to [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/) and enter your Profile Name.
* Find the line that begins with ""steamID64"". This is the URL you need. URLs containing your profile name will be rejected.

--------

Thanks to all that help and a major thank you to the developer of the bot, /u/drkabob! Please note, this is not an actual entry into the secret santa event - More info on the event (dates, how to enter properly) will be announced within this week.

**Be sure to read all of what I have to say here, or you will not qualify**.

I want to give away a **Smoking German Gonzila** to somebody who has always wanted to get into unusual trading but has never had the wealth. This is a lower tier hat/effect combo, you should be able to fetch a bud pure and slightly over in other unusuals (I was recently offered a 30 key engy hat for it). My goal is to give this away to somebody who won't just sell it for promos but rather try to work their way up the unusual ladder and begin to get into high-value trading.

I'll have everybody that believes they fit the above description post below, those who qualify (based on my judgement) [will be added to this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R6fBjeg8bTptONeP-Cg9bbMeFNcvFN3Dv4Vlc_GKULo/edit) and a winner will be chosen tonight or tomorrow morning.

**So here are the official requirements:**

* You must not be able to afford an unusual yourself. I want to give this away to somebody who needs it to get started.
* You must show an active interest in trading.
* You must make a top-level reply to this post saying why you're interested in trading and what you want to do with this hat
* You must have *reddit flair* on your account. Look at the sidebar to figure out how to do that.
* Do not add me, please. That will just make me sad

So there you go, good luck. I won't be posting an update or anything, this is it.

1. Pick a number between 0001-1000.

2. Please leave the numbers you choose in a 4 digit format. (example 23=0023,  420=0420) This will make it easier for me to find the winner if it's a lower number.

3. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE! YOU MUST HAVE FLAIR TO ENTER THIS RAFFLE. This is non negeotiable. Don't have flair? [Then what are you waiting for ya dingus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/katuk/good_news_everybody_you_can_now_have_a_link_to/) 

4. Please upvote this for visibility. I get no karma.

If someone has chosen the same number as you and that number wins, then the person who chose first will be the winner. But **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE** check before you choose a number.

Now, another site has been brought up by him. tf2-items.com is the same deal. (Note the hyphen in there! Don't confuse it with tf2items.com!) He makes you get in-game, makes you trade in the steam browser, and puts a tf2-items link there. You click it and it trades your items for you. He tries to bait you into clicking the link by saying ""This is a backpack checker, this will check your backpack to see if there are any dupes in there!"" Don't fall for it. It's obviously a scam. Let the admins know so he can get marked. Futhermore, [report the site to google](http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/), so the site can be taken down for phishing.

So, I tried to make a screenshot service using TF2 in-game, and a few days later, Source Filmmaker came out, so that went down the pan, but now I've got something completely more unique.....a .gif service. Yep.


As for the ""help you sell your unusuals"" comment, I personally get tired of having to use the slightly more than half broken itemtest, so if anything I just want more people to show what their unusuals look like before selling them to someone.


NOTE: As someone pointed out in the comments, I forgot to include the procedure for people who want these made, all I would need you to do is join a server with me. **No possessions need to be handed over for this service**

Update your bookmarks!**

I'll start off by saying that I'm not affiliated with scrap.tf in any way. (For those of you who don't know, scrap.tf is a site where you can do scrapbanking, hatbanking, keybanking and ticketbanking with 100% automated trade bots.)

The creator of scrap.tf, Jessecar96 (along with geel9) released a wrapper called SteamBot, written in C# which allowed you to interact with Steam and Steam Trading.

My keybanking bot is a heavily customized version of SteamBot, and you can view a demo by trading Klaus the Keybanker bot. Add him via his profile [here](http://steamcommunity.com/id/KlausKey/).

I originally wrote this bot for my small Steam community, [The CTS Community](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity) to use.  
Now I've decided to release the source code for my keybanking bot so that everybody can learn how it works. I've also coded a scrapbanking bot very similar to scrap.tf's, but I'm not ready to share it at this time.

**You can find the source code on Github's Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/waylaidwanderer/5127827).**

Why am I sharing this, you ask? Recently the admin of the so called ""Gentlemann's Estate and Haberdashery"" Steam group has decided to share and release an older version of the bot (without the source code), without permission or proper credit.  
Therefore I've decided that it'd be better if I shared my code - this way you'll get the newest, updated version of the bot *and* the source code.

Feel free to modify it and redistribute it as you wish, but *please* give me (and the original creators of SteamBot) proper credit! That's all I ask! Of course, I can't stop you nor will I know if you don't...

***If you're looking for instructions on how to use the bot, please read the comment on the Gist linked above. If you've read all that and you still need help, send me a message. I can be found on Steam via [my profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/waylaidwanderer) or you can just PM me or leave a comment.***",,False,,t5_2s0s4,1362908746.0,,default,True,t3_16hbof,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/16hbof/psa_ever_wondered_how_the_bots_behind_scraptf/,

I run a small trading community called [The Hooded Alliance](http://www.thehoodedalliance.com). I was on our unusual trading server last night and there were a few people who were just trolling and didn't even have the capacity to purchase any unusual hats.

Today, I launched a new server that I'm calling ""High-Value Trading"". When you connect, the server will check that your backpack is public and that its value is at least 75 refined according to [backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf).

Let me set this perfectly clear. This is *not* an elitism thing. This is *not* designed to be an exclusive club or anything. This is just a place for people to trade their expensive stuff and be sure that other people on the server are able to buy them.

The server's [GameTracker page is located here](http://www.gametracker.com/server_info/199.96.84.29:27015/), or you can get information on the clan's [servers page](http://www.thehoodedalliance.com/servers/).

I'd like to know if you have any feedback.

**Q: What happens if I trade someone on the server and the trade results in my backpack becoming worth less than 75 refined?**
&gt; A: Nothing. The server only checks your backpack value while you connect.

**Q: Can you whitelist my friend whose backpack isn't worth 75 refined?**
&gt; A: Sorry, no.

**Q: What happens if Steam or Backpack.tf goes down?**
&gt; A: If Steam or Backpack.tf goes down, no checks will be made on your backpack so you can continue connecting as usual.

**Q: Do I HAVE to be making high-value trades?**
&gt; A: Nope! As long as your backpack value passes the check, you can trade whatever.

Download [sandboxie](http://www.sandboxie.com/), install the free trial version and let it run. 

Create a new sandbox (name it as you wish) and delete the default sandbox that was already there. Right click your new sandbox and go to **settings**-&gt;**restrictions**-&gt;**drop rights**

 and **uncheck (!)** ***Drop rights from Administrators and Power User groups***.  
  

Next, click **Resource Access-&gt;File Access-&gt;Full Access**


and add your HDD or, if you have more than one, the HDD with Steam installed.

Close settings, right click on your sandbox and choose **'run sandboxed'** and then either start Steam from the Start menu (4th option) or run Windows explorer (5th option) and start Steam from within the window that opens.

That's it, log on to your alt with sandboxie and start Steam the normal way to get your main account online as well. You can only have one sandbox running with the free trial, but for trading purposes that should be alright.

------

Hi guys recently saw the screenshot service on the front page. Not ragging on that guy but there should be *almost* no reason to hand over an unusual.

I take my screenshots by having you join any server and I go spectate and free look follow you as you play the game. 

This accomplishes three things

1. **Your unusual never changes hands. You keep it the entire time!**
2. It makes for some nice ""action"" shots with explosions and such
3. Have your exact loadout included in the screenshots

Some examples of my work [Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/sRSZP.png), [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/vm6Ai.png), [Example 3](http://i.imgur.com/ShmBE.jpg), [Example 4](http://i.imgur.com/CDXyo.jpg)

And a good [before and after shot of my work](http://i.imgur.com/gnnyH.jpg)

As for payment, I do the service mostly to practice my photoshop skills so there is no fee for the service :)

On the other hand if you want to throw some metal over my way I will gladly accept it :)

Feel free to add me, but please leave a comment here first so I know who you are.

**edit** 

Received a comment from Shok

&gt;Ah ok, I tried to explain it above, but I'll try to elaborate a bit. There was one person, who insisted that I took screenshots of him while he wore the hat. The biggest problem I found was that it's very hard to coordinate. I had to tell him to stand somewhere, but I couldn't actually point to where I wanted him to stand, I had to instead tell him to move left, or right and when to taunt etc. The other big problem was, that in a public server, we didn't have sv_cheats on, so I couldn't switch off the HUD. Moreover, on that public server, there were constant popups of ""donate to get reserved slots"" and other such messages which ruined the screenshots. If you trade me your hat, I don't need to coordinate with you, and it makes it much easier and faster to take the screenshots. Moreover, I can use sv_cheats and therefore, switch off the hud and use thirdperson mode. I guess you don't have to trust me, but as I've said, I've done a few screenshots for some notable people. You can always check me by going in the RUGC Chat. TL;DR, its hard to take good screenshots if you wear the hats. it's easier to take good screenshots if i'm wearing the hats.

He brings up some good points. It gets rid of some of the problems of screenshotting but I still operate on the fact that there are other ways to go around those problems. 

Please don't downvote or discourage Shok he has great screenies and is just doing things his way. I put this trade up here to supply another service for the people that don't feel right trading their unusuals.

&gt;In ~2 weeks time we will be **requiring** you to have flair to submit trades and comment on the subreddit. We have some new back-end tools at our disposal that will make moderating easier for us. Flair being required also means no posts from people who don't leave their SteamID and don't have flair. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**How do I update my flair?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Go to http://trade.redditgaming.com/start and go through the two logins to receive approved submitter status on the subreddit. Once you go through this process and receive a message from SteamBot saying you're an approved submitter, you're finished completely. Simple as that!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**I already have flair, do I need to do it again through this system?** 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yes, you'll need to go through the process once to get approved submitter status on the subreddit. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Can I change the steam account associated with my reddit account?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Currently, no. The SteamID you sign up with is tied to your reddit account, so make sure you are logged into the correct accounts before you sign up for flair. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**What is flair?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Flair is the steam icon next to your name in the subreddit that links to your steam account.

_____________

**Rules and Introduction**

It's me, back again! I've decided how I'm going to do this now:

Every 2 weeks or so I will post a flair request thread. I'll start taking requests for 24 hours. Then I'll brew some tea and toast some crumpets and I'll go on a massive flair spree for an hour or two, making my way through till all requests are done. 

Also because I'm making this a semi-regular thing now I wanna make some rules (not scary rules).

+ **You must only ask for a flair if you have the intention of donating, or have previously donated.**
+ Please check the hat has not already been made by going to the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/121jz7/introducing_donator_flair/)
+ Please give me any info I might need; *Style, Paint, Unusual effect*
+ 1 request per person, feel free to come back next fortnight if you feel like switching things up a bit.
+ No down voting others. All requests will be seen and fulfilled.
+ I aim to please, but if you're unhappy with the quality of a flair, please politely ask. 

If you don't have [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) I highly suggest you get it. It gives you a little hand button to show [what the flairs will look like](http://i.imgur.com/hMdvj.png). 

If you don't have it yet, I strongly recommend [Flair Linker Enhanced](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wvmk8/psa_flair_linker_enhanced_is_now_available/) 
______________________________________

**What this is all about?** 

If you've been around in the last few weeks or so, you will know about the new hat flair that you get when donating to the server. 

To find out more go [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/121jz7/introducing_donator_flair/)

I think it's a brilliant idea, so I wanted to add to the hats being made flairs. 

So here's the plan. You make a request below then I will try to make it for you. I'm fairly new to this, so go easy on me. I will try to do as many as possible. 

All I want in return is for you to donate to the server. That's it!

I will add to the current weeks list with ones to be made. They will either be in progress or queued up to be made.

1352339312.0,71,self.tf2trade,12u08b,[PSA] Backpack.tf Prices,89,18,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/12u08b/psa_backpacktf_prices/,"==== **NOT MY WORK, CREDIT TO [guancialle](http://www.reddit.com/user/guancialle) I Just want to spread the word** *Upvote so Others can See please*=== **BE SURE TO POST ON THE ORIGINAL** Link at the bottom of the page.

This is a pretty long rant and there is a tl;dr

So Backpack.tf used to be a very helpful site where you could get an accurate interpretation on the prices of items. People in the community could vote on the price of an item and when a bunch of people agreed with it and had proof of there claim then the moderators would change the price of the desired item. This all seems like an awesome idea because you can vote on what you want and if you get say 160 people agreeing with you and 10 that don't, plus if you have proof that the item is what you claim it is then you've just helped out the community a little.


Recently thought well browsing certain items or browsing different websites I have found more and more proof that this so called ""great website"" is in fact becoming corrupt. I'll just start with some straight up facts


I am not saying that the admins are changing the prices for there benefit or that That these prices are wrong, I am showing Where Admins have either screwed up on purpose or have changed the prices for some apparent reason that the majority of the voters don't agree with


Price's that have a big positive majority vote and are denied
So the following are just a few incredibly bad decisions made by the moderators of backpack.tf


**Lumbricous Lid**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5096229fba25363d0c000000 The following link shows a trade that someone suggested. He started a vote to change the item from 6 ref to about 2-3 keys (5.33- 8 ref) Now around 238 people agreed with him and 79 people disagreed which is 75% agree. apparently though since no admins thought to close or accept the offer it was naturally declined.
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/507c4ce049d7b83071000002 194 votes for 23 votes against but Chancellor Puddinghead closed to trade because of some reason.


**Earbuds**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/508d8107ba2536e10f000002 wanted to lower the price by 1 key because thats what people were buying them for. 207 for, 86 votes against, Brad Pitt close the trade.
*Kringle Colellection*
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5089c77c49d7b8280f000002 all he wanted was to change the value by about .5 keys, he even had Proof of his accusation. 246 for, 74 against and was closed


**Festive Medi gun**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/50772ead49d7b80006000000. 219 votes for, 11 votes against and the suggestion was closed by ""Chancellor Puddinghead""


**B.M.O.C**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5066dbf349d7b8923d000001 240 for, 49 against. And it's declined.
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5074d8b149d7b82f7e000000 230 for the price, 58 against. And it's declined.
The list goes on forever but I really don't want to find all of them. obviously if the public are agreeing on something and there's a score of 100+ and they have proof then it should be changed to that price
Price's that have a huge negative vote and are accepted
These are literally worse than another trade. For some reason admins at backpack.tf seem to want to change prices of certain items even though majority of the community doesn't


**Buds**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/507bc5f149d7b83b3b000001 So this is just wrong. The Oatmeal wanted to change the price of an item by raising it's price from 27-28 keys to 28 keys. She had no evidence just 1 link that said that they have changed. Didn't show anyone buying or selling at that price. She had 45 votes for her and 201 votes against. That's a score of -155. Apparently though an admin liked this and though that he should change the price anyways.
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/508f26e5ba2536a601000014 Again a score of -15 with 236 for and 252 against. But the creator of the website thought he should change the price anyways


**Kringle Colellection**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/505cb2de9ae21ad704000000 . This person had no proof what so ever just the sentence ""Nobody is selling under 6 keys"" .9 votes for the price, 58 votes against but apparently ""Chancellor Puddinghead"" (this name comes up a lot) decided to change the price
There are more that are in the negatives but I haven't had the time to look at even close to a 1% of the items. There are at least 40 that I saw that had a score of 1-8 and are accepted. It just shows that these moderators are obviously wanting to control the economy on there own.
I don't know if anyone else agrees with me but I thought I should just share these facts. The moderators are either changing the price of an item when majority of voters don't. or they are not changing the price of an item when voters want the price to be changed.
This is really sketchy Stuff because http://bazaar.tf/ is based on these prices and multitudes of people go by backpack.tf prices. I for one used to go by backpack.tf prices but now that I have found loads of instances where the mods are using there ""powers"" against the majority of voters.
I would really like some input on this so please don't down vote and browse away.



**tl;dr**
Backpack.tf is supposed to be a place where you can vote on what you think should be the value of an item. If a big majority of voters agree with you and you have some solid evidence that people are either buying or selling at that price then an admin can approve the price and update the price on there website.
The mods though have been using there power against the community which includes: Changing an items price when a big majority of people don't want it changed or not changing an item's pice when a big majority of people want it changed.
Scores (positive minus negative) that include: 159 , 171 , 121 , 172 , 209 , 191 and 172 and declined the right to change there price and scores that include: -155 , -15 and -49 are accepted into changing there price when it should be the other way around.

I’m going to try to make this as short as possible, please bear with me.

I managed to get a BMOC and an Ebenezer—I’m very lucky, I know. I was one of the first few to get it I think. I came across a thread someone posted on SPUF stating he was selling his BMOC. Here is the post:

http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2378014

I took a look out of curiosity and saw the following user known as “Cheeser” made an offer of $361 for the BMOC.

Here is his SPUF profile:

I sent him a pm on SPUF letting him know I had one and this is the conversation that took place immediately after:

What a scumbag. Again, here is all his information:

Now I posted all this on tf2outpost and warned a few other people about this guy and thought to myself that would be enough to thwart his scamming efforts. I was wrong. Check out what happened today:

http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/385026

It’s the same fucking guy. He scammed someone out of a holiday headcase. He probably got away with it because I was TOO FUCKING LAZY to post more about this guy and urge the community to spread the word. It’s too late for Wyldecaveman but hopefully this post can prevent someone else from getting scammed by this asshole. 

Please reddit community, upvote this to the top. I don’t care about any karma bullshit and don’t even know how it works—just look at my account, I’m just not into that—and I’ll even delete my account if it will help. I just want to make sure this asshole NEVER gets the chance to scam someone else from that account. If I had just posted this last night maybe Wyldecaveman and possibly others wouldn’t have been scammed. 

If anyone can help get his steam and steam user forum accounts banned I’d appreciate it more than words can say. 

Please guys, ALWAYS check steamrep—no exceptions! Please NEVER trade for cash with anyone who isn’t very well known in this community—always trade for promos if you can help it. Never click on any link some unknown person sends you via steam pm. Finally, *please* don’t let greed cloud your judgement. ~~Wyldecaveman was offered $100 by mattie, who has one of the best and widely known reputations out there, but was turned down. For fucks sake, if mattie came to me with that offer I’d have taken it!~~

~~Look at his reputation:~~

~~If mattie ever makes you guys out there an offer please know, after you verify it’s actually him, that it’s the real deal.~~ 
I don’t know what else to say other than if someone ever tries scamming you log as much information as possible and report it to steamrep.
I want to thank fashnek for his help in tracking down the scammed item, here is a copy and paste of the information he posted:

There will be a raffle/giveaway every day this week up to and including Friday! Yesterday's raffle winner is now announced, and today's raffle is for a Villain's Veil!",76,10,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/x5bu1/psa_and_raffle_3_im_hosting_a_huge_event_to_help/,"##Please upvote this post for visibility, as it is important for the success of what I have planned! 

------------------------------------------------------------

###PSA and Raffle #3

------------------------------------------------------------

For those who missed the announcement yesterday, here it is again! Plus another raffle, with slightly better prizes (a hat this time)!

You may know me from [an announcement I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ws4ye/psa_come_join_the_community_trade_server_where/) last week about setting up a new trade server, focusing on trading with a sense of community.

It hasn't been that popular, but it has gotten a fair amount of people occasionally. So I got to thinking, ""how can I help make my trade server more popular, and have more people join, and hopefully come back regularly?"" 

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, I decided to organize an event, hosted on my trade server, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His partner?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday, 12 PM PST**, I will be hosting an epic battle on my server! I call it: ""The Huntsman and the Spy"". 

---------------------------------

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers, and 7 spies.

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map, but spies are allowed.

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!), and the goal of each sniper will be to use their Huntsman to take out enemy snipers on the other side of the map. Your spy partner can either hang around you to protect you from enemy spies, or they can choose to sneak their way across the map and backstab enemy snipers. 

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats, until there are 3 semi-finalist teams on Red and Blu. 

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, the last team standing on Red or Blu will move to the final round. In the second round, the semi-finalists must keep battling until there is a winner on the team that did not win the first time (e.g. If a team on Blu won the first time, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round, the two teams must go head to head with each other. Sniper vs sniper, with both spies trying to protect their sniper and take out the other sniper and spy. The first sniper to die will cause their team to lose.

And that's it for the rules!

I will be announcing the grand prizes (one for the Sniper and one for the Spy, along with the prizes for each of the round winners) tomorrow. The grand prizes are both worth a couple keys each, and *if people are kind enough to donate*, the winners will get even more cool stuff! 

#**If you are interested in registering for this tournament, please fill out this fancy form [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHVOTVg0a21VdFJMN09BTm1nYlZrRnc6MQ). You MUST have a partner to be your Spy or Sniper before you can enter (only one of you needs to fill out the form)! So tell a buddy or an online friend about this. :) It is up to you to decide who will be who.**

The list of competitors will be announced on **~~Wednesday~~ Thursday**, along with the team that they will be on, so check back for the post! Join my Steam group as well [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CommunityTrade) so you'll know when I make the announcement!

There will be a giveaway every day of this week up until the Saturday event. The prizes will get better and better!

I was wondering why Valve doesn't implement a system where when you log into your TF2 account, you can make it optional to set a 4 digit password onto your backpack so that there's an extra layer of security if you get hacked (you can always choose not to have this option). If you fail X amount of times, you're locked out of the backpack for X hours/days- anything that'll buy more time to recover your account and your original items. 

Just an idea. Would this be possible? Possible downsides? 

I know for sure if I were given this option, I'd buy into it, just because there's a extra layer of security to deter hacking or at very least make it a bit more difficult.

Winners are listed below along with commentary. Winners, you have been added to my Steam friends list, please accept the invite to claim your prizes!**

Before I get to posting the winners, I'd like to post a few thoughts and observations now that the contest is over.

When I initially posted this message here to Reddit, I did not expect the positive reaction I'd get from this community. I was told by a couple of friends of mine that Reddit would welcome my contest, but I hadn't really anticipated the warm welcome I would receive.

So many users not only took time to write out thoughtful and polite messages as they submitted their entries for my contest, but many of them even went as far as to give me something I very rarely receive from anyone -- gratitude.

&gt; Thanks again for letting me participate!

&gt; Congrats on your unusuals! Thank you for being extremely generous!

&gt; Thank you very much for this opportunity! 

&gt; Thanks for doing this!

&gt; Good luck on naming your hats - a great collection to be sure.

&gt; Thanks for doing the contest man!

&gt; Thanks for the opportunity, I hope you find some great names!

&gt; Gratz on the collection, and may your hats be blessed with names so great that Gaben himself will carry you to valve.

(That last one cracked me up, not gonna lie. :D)

I'm not going to sugarcoat this -- I've known some very, very selfish people. It's very much a foreign feeling for me to do something for someone (let alone a large group of people) and receive a ""thank you"" for it and yet, I'm honestly flabbergasted at how polite so many of you were. Not one person insulted me or gave me a hard time over this contest. There was a heartwarming lack of aggression -- some folks were eager to win a prize, sure, but there wasn't anyone who was pressuring or bullying me into giving them something. You were polite, you were diligent, and you guys put forth a good effort. To this end, I wish I could do more for you guys, I really do.

I offer my sincerest thanks to everyone here at Reddit who welcomed a grade-A newbie with open arms and touched my heart-- all of my hearts, actually-- with your clever wit and great attitudes. I hope you all have a wonderful Valentine's Day.

--Alice

**Who's getting a new unusual?**

This was a tough contest to judge. So many people entered (upwards of 70+ unique users entering, many going full-throttle and entering for all nine hats) that it was hard to determine a winner for each hat let alone which of the nine final submissions would be the one that took home the entire sandvich.

That having been said, Bracker's ""Dear John,"" entry for the Unusual Soldier's Stash caught me by surprise. I loved how simplistic and yet emotional the name and description was, and how well it worked on the entire theme. It didn't feel shoehorned or forced, but rather completely natural. So without further ado, congratulations to Bracker for winning the grand prize, an Unusual Capo's Capper with Orbiting Planets! Have fun with your new hat, mate! :)

To everyone else who won, a shiny new Mann Co Crate Key is waiting for you, so stop on by and pick it up!

Once again, thanks to all who made this contest a great success! Happy Valentine's Day, everyone!

~~Hi there, fellow TF2 fans! I'm new to Reddit and this is my first post so please be all gentle-like. (If I'm posting this in the wrong section please let me know; I ran a cursory search for ""contest"" over r/tf2trade and saw a few other users who posted similar threads so I just assumed it was okay for here.)~~

~~I recently completed my long and expensive quest to obtain an Unusual Hat with the effect of Circling Heart for each of the nine classes in *Team Fortress 2*. I want to celebrate by naming and describing them all, so I thought “hey, why not make a contest out of this so that I can share the wealth a little with some of Team Fortress 2’s awesome community?”~~

~~The contest is open to anyone who’s interested in entering and there are some prizes to be had (including an Unusual hat!), but there are some restrictions and guidelines.~~

~~**What kind of guidelines are there regarding entries (content, character length, etcetera)?**~~

~~First, the name and description must be able to fit on a Name Tag and Description Tag, respectively. For the hat’s name, the limit is 40 characters. For the hat’s description, the limit is 80 characters.~~

~~Any entries containing any of the following will not be accepted:~~

~~* Vulgar and/or offensive language (including profanity)~~
~~* Sexually explicit references/phrases/innuendo~~
~~* Hateful/racist words or phrases~~
~~* Entries containing website URLs or any form of advertising~~
~~* Otherwise inappropriate content (Use your best judgment; if you have to ask if it’ll be accepted or not you may want to rethink it.)~~

~~Incomplete entries (only a hat name or only a hat description) will not be accepted; both a name and description is required for each entry.~~

~~**How many times can I enter?**~~

~~You are welcome to submit an entry for as many or as few of the hats you prefer, but you are only permitted to enter **one name and one description per hat**.

1354667606.0,62,self.tf2trade,14ak0p,[PSA] How to trade your TF2 (or any Steam-tradable) inventory for currency over Paypal/Moneypak!,71,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/14ak0p/psa_how_to_trade_your_tf2_or_any_steamtradable/,"In this guide, we will discuss the safe methods by which to convert your TF2 (or any Steam-tradable) items for cash over Paypal or Moneypak. Old guide can be found [here](http://redd.it/luc4d).

I will assume you know how to find a buyer/seller and list your items. That information should be obvious, if you're using this community. I will also assume you have set up a Paypal account. Verify it!

**Full disclosure: selling items for cash over Paypal is never 100% safe. Chargebacks can and do happen, even with users who have a lot of rep. The best you can do is minimize your risk by following these steps OR using Moneypak (USA residents only, but read on).**

*****

***Step One: Rep rep rep!***

When selling or buying an item over Paypal, the #1 most important thing is reputation. Without it, you will have a hard time buying items of significant value because it's unclear whether you can be trusted not to incur a chargeback. It's also important as a seller because you will attract more business if you have a lot of +rep.

**[SteamRep](http://steamrep.com)** is your *best friend* when determining whether someone is reputable or not. SteamRep is a scam report database, wherein users submit proof that another user is a scammer. Under no circumstances should you trade with a scammer because you are putting yourself at significant risk to get the scammer tag passed on to you.

* [Here is what a community admin's profile will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197975564454)

* [Here is what a scammer's profile will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198039183046)

* [Here is what a person with no special tag will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197964482358)

*Special note:* You should Google the other trader's SteamID64, which is their **permanent profile link**. As /u/varrogath points out, there could be a scam report filed against them that has not yet resulted in the scammer being marked. This is a great suggestion!

**Reputation threads** are used to keep track of purchases/sales made over Paypal/Moneypak, and it's highly encouraged to set one up. There are only two websites that house rep threads that I recognize as legitimate (though more may exist):

* [SourceOP.com](http://forums.sourceop.com/forum/) is the birthplace of modern Steam trading. For reasons unknown to me, people came here originally to sell TF2 items, and it quickly gained fame as the most heavily trafficked trade site. Many thousands of rep threads are hosted there, [such as mine!](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=76672&amp;highlight=)

* [Dota2Traders.com](http://dota2traders.com) is a site created by some users of /r/dota2trade (my brainchild) and others who wanted to set up a home base of their own. It is now officially affiliated with SteamRep, so you can host your rep thread there and file a scam report with them. They have middlemen at their disposal, as well.

When examining someone's rep thread, you need to take into account the following things:

1. How old is the thread? If it's brand new, that may be a warning sign. If it's months or years old, that's probably a good sign.

2. How many +reps does this person have? If only just a few, I would avoid doing a large transaction with them. If there is any -rep, read it carefully and determine if it's worth the risk!

3. Is the person you're talking to *really* the person in the rep thread? Double check by asking them to PM you from that forum account with a secret phrase! I've been impersonated about a dozen times by people who link to my rep thread with a spoof account on Steam. Be careful!

If the person's rep checks out with you, move forward. If not, walk away! You have no reason to feel guilty about saying no.

**In the event someone doesn't have a rep thread, but you want to work with them anyway,** look at their Steam profile. Consider the following things:

* Profile rep means nothing. It can be deleted by the owner of the Steam profile, so you won't see any -rep if the owner doesn't want you to.

* If the profile is extremely new with *few* games and/or friends, you should probably walk away.

* If the account is old (think *at least* one year old) and the owner has many hours (think hundreds or thousands of hours) of game play, then they are more trustworthy than Joe Random, who has a sketchy profile. Still, a rep thread is best!

*****

***Step Two: Finding a middleman***

The use of a middleman when dealing with Paypal/Moneypak transactions is *imperative*. It significantly reduces the risk for both parties, since neither will have to ""go first"" when trading. There are many great and trustworthy individuals who offer their services for free, but some may charge a small fee. Tipping is entirely optional, but it is considered polite to tip the middleman if it's a large or time-consuming transaction.

* Some /r/tf2trade and all /r/dota2trade moderators can and do perform middleman services on a regular basis. [Message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTF2Trade) here or [over at r/dota2trade](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) if you need someone! I have middlemanned for well over $10000 in goods over two years.

* [SteamRep middlemen](http://steamrep.com/list/M) are community admins who volunteer their time, and can be trusted 100%.

* [Dota2Traders](http://dota2traders.com/pages/middleman/) has a list of middlemen. I recommend Leon!

If you can't find one, wait until you can! Do not rush a deal, or you might end up getting scammed, and there's nothing anyone can do about it at that point.

*****

***Step Three: Completing the transaction!***

Once you have found a middleman and all parties are online, the transaction should go as follows:

1. Group chat is opened with all parties involved.

2. Check everyone's profiles to make sure that there are no impersonators or fake middlemen.

3. Seller then sends the items to the middleman. [Beware the middleman injection scam!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/13072o/psa_trading_reminders_be_careful/) Check the person you're trading with before accepting.

4. Buyer then sends a gift payment over Paypal to the seller. Gifts aren't protection against a chargeback, but at least make it more of a pain to accomplish. Some people also request that the buyer includes a link to the buyer's Steam profile in the notes section and a bit claiming that they won't chargeback. Again, this won't save you from a chargeback, but it's good form to complete anyway.

5. Seller confirms that the cash has arrived as expected. If there is a dispute about the amount, fees, or whether the payment has arrived, the middleman holds the items until a resolution has been reached.

6. Middleman then sends the items to the buyer.

7. Exchange +rep on rep threads and/or profiles and/or reddit threads.

8. Tips are optional :)

It is at this point that you may all part ways with the transaction complete.

Please read on for how to complete a Moneypak transaction!

*****

***Step 3.1: Using Moneypak instead of Paypal***

[Green Dot Moneypak](http://moneypak.com) is a service that allows buyers in the USA to put an amount of money (usually up to $500) onto a pre-paid card. This card has a code on the back, which can be redeemed for 100% safe Paypal funds through the Moneypak site. This is a great alternative to straight Paypal, because even if someone has no rep, they can buy items using Moneypak with no risk to the seller.

If the seller is not located in the USA, then the code on the back will be irredeemable, meaning you will need a middleman (again, USA resident) to redeem the code and send the cash from his account. I have personally done this for many transactions from $200-1000 and more.

*Note:* it is polite to accept a smaller amount to compensate the buyer for the extra effort of this process.

Follow these steps to complete a Moneypak transfer:

1. Buyer charges a Moneypak card at a retailer such as Walmart, Walgreens, or any other participating store, with the desired amount. 

2. Upon returning home, group chat is set up with the middleman and the buyer/seller.

3. Seller sends the middleman the item(s). Again, beware the [middleman injection scam!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/13072o/psa_trading_reminders_be_careful/)

4. Buyer then sends the seller the Moneypak code from the card. If the seller is non-US, then the code goes to the middleman (who also must be US-based). Seller or middleman redeems the code on Moneypak's site, which transfers the cash to their Paypal account automatically.

5. If the middleman redeemed the code, he then sends the seller the cash over Paypal.

6. Seller confirms that the cash has arrived as expected.

7. Middleman sends the buyer the item(s).

8. Rep is exchanged, drinks are had.

9. Again, tipping optional :)

1329082577.0,61,self.tf2trade,pmhup,[PSA] How to check if an item is duped,74,13,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/pmhup/psa_how_to_check_if_an_item_is_duped/,"I've seen quite a bit of confusion about how to determine if a given item is duped (and who it was duped by), so I figured I would clear the air. There have been multiple incorrect accusations being flung around, and before you accuse someone of duping you should be certain.

Every item in TF2 has two numeric identifiers: a *current id* and an *original id*. When an item is traded, it gets a new current id, but not a new original id. These two numbers let sites like TF2Items construct a (partial) trade history of the item, so you can see who has owned it.

A duplicated item is one that shares the same *original id* with another item, but has a different *current id*. It used to be very difficult to determine whether an item was duplicated, but TF2Items has recently updated their site to make it easier.

To determine if an item is duped, you can either click it on TF2Items to view its history, or click it in TF2B and look at the bottom right to get its original and current ids. Then navigate to the following URL, replacing ID with the current id:

http://tf2items.com/item/ID

If this doesn't work, it means that TF2Items hasn't indexed the item yet. Try the same thing using the item's original id.

Scan the item history on the right hand side to see the previous current ids for the item. If you see the message ""This item potentially still exists"", the item *may* be duped. Here's a [duped pair of buds](http://www.tf2items.com/item/650293214) as an example. This item was possibly duplicated by [this person](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047163110), but it may have also been duplicated by customer support (see below).

Remember, though, that TF2Items isn't perfect. First, it relies on the Steam item servers being functional, which as we all know is not always the case. :) Second, it can't see backpacks of users who have set their profile (or backpack) to private.

Since most of the people who duped items were smart enough to set their backpacks to private before duping, it's very difficult to figure out who was behind it. Since TF2Items only learns about items when someone views the backpack of their owner, owners whose backpacks have always been set to private never appear in the history of the item. Also, note that if you see the ""this item may still exist"" message, but the person's backpack is set to private, it's possible that the item was just traded. Again, since TF2Items can't see into private backpacks, it can't figure out whether the item is still in there or if it was traded.

Now, just because someone has a duped item doesn't mean they're evil. Duped items have been in the system now for months, and if you deal in high-tier items it's likely you have some in your backpack right now. Also, there have been a rash of account hijacks over the past few months, and the items that have been stolen have been duplicated by Valve customer support to restore them back to the original owners. In this case, the *original owners* (the victims, not the hijackers) will be shown in the item history with the ""this item still potentially exists"" message -- so don't accuse them of duping.

So, how can we tell if someone duplicated an item? Only if *they currently have two items with the same original id, but different current ids in their backpack*. However, to my knowledge, Valve deleted all of the duplicate items that had not been traded, so it's very unlikely that you'll find anyone in this situation.

Now, to dispel some myths about duping:

**MYTH: Items can still be duped**

While no one knows for certain, neither Valve nor the TF2 community at-large is aware of a repeatable duplication exploit that currently works. No new duplicate items since the glitch was fixed, except those created by Valve customer support in response to hijacks. *(Edit: read the comments below. There have definitely been cases where items were duplicated, but it does not appear to be happening en masse.)*

**MYTH: Items in invalid backpack positions were duped**

This has *absolutely nothing* to do with duping. Most people have items in invalid or overlapping positions. It just means the items were acquired via Steam Trade and the user hasn't started TF2 yet, or hasn't clicked the ""you have new items"" alert in the game.

**MYTH: Anyone with a duplicated item is suspect**

Since the items have been in the system for a long time, most of them have been acquired by honest traders. Just because someone has a duplicated item doesn't mean anything about them personally.

**MYTH: Item history with the same owner twice in a row means the item is duped**

You can have the same owner twice in an item's history list for many valid reasons, including painting/un-painting the item, adding/removing name or description tags, and moving the item to and from a private alt account. (The last one *may* be a little shady, but it doesn't mean it's duped.)

Hopefully this clears things up a bit. If anyone has anything to add, feel free!

1326302043.0,65,self.tf2trade,ocjn7,A guide to unusual value,78,13,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ocjn7/a_guide_to_unusual_value/,"**I originally posted this in r/tf2, but it's definitely relevant here as well.**

Hello there! This guide is meant to educate people on how unusuals are generally priced. There's a lot of different variables involved, such as the effect and the actual hat, and I'm going to explain how each of them can affect the price.

**Class**

Which class is the unusual for? Some classes are played more than others, and thus unusuals for those classes tend to cost more. The general price ranking goes:

Soldier&gt;Scout/Demo/Medic&gt;Pyro/Engineer/Sniper/Spy&gt;Heavy

Note how the classes used in competitive play are more expensive than the other classes. Multiclass or allclass unusuals are worth a lot more.

**Effect**

What effect does the unusual have? This is probably the most important part of the pricing. Better effects (burning flames, sunbeams etc) increase an unusual's worth more than worse effects (fetti, flies, logo etc).

Unusual effect tier list (submitted by ubermuppy and edited by me). Descending value from top to bottom and left to right.

God tier - burning, stormy storm, sunbeams, cloudy moon

High - scorching, blizzard, orbiting lantern, purple energy, green energy

Mid - orbiting fire, ghosts, hearts, smoking, steaming, cauldron bubbles, vivid plasma, searing plasma

Low - planets, bubbling, nuts and bolts (unless on an engineer hat), logo, peace, purple/green confetti, flies,

**The actual hat**

Do people perceive the actual hat as being good? This is a subject of opinion, but an unusual will be worth more if people think the hat is good. For example, assuming they both have the same effect, an unusual Tyrant's Helm will be worth more than an Exquisite Rack, because people think that the Tyrant's looks better.

Cancerous hats - brain bucket, rack, dixie, beanie, coupe, hard counter, Capotain, elfin deal, steely boot, mining light, engie cap, doctor's sack, nanobalacava, raincatcher, geisha boy etc...

**Misc**

Is it a miscellaneous item? Unusuals that go in the misc slot can be worn with unusuals that go in the head slot, thus combining two effects. Therefore, people will pay more for them. Misc items that can be found in unusual quality are:

* Bonk Boy
* Large Luchadore
* Brainiac Hairpiece
* Blighted Beak
* Villain's Veil
* Le Party Phantom
* Noh Mercy

**Theme**

Does the unusual have a theme? If the hat and the effect create some kind of reference to something, it can increase the value. For example, a Mirror with the effect Smoking creates the theme ""Smoke and Mirrors"" But please, for the love of God, don't tag an obscure theme onto an unusual for the sake of trying to increase the value a bit. It probably won't work.

Examples of themed hats - any fire effect on pyro, purple energy experience/fro, peace or hearts medic hats, blizzard festive tree.

**How to search for your OWN price checks**

Type in on google - site:www.sourceop.com ""Burning"" ""Team Captain""

Use www.tf2outpost.com for a search function, see what other people are selling the hat for.

Use www.tf2tp.com for a search, keep in mind this site is actually pretty awful for searches.

Current offers are what you're looking for, buyouts are a terrible thing to go on. Someone may be asking for 12 buds for their hat, but if all of their C/Os are around 7-8 then realistically it's not going to sell for that unless you get lucky or have extreme patience.

Use your own intuition, do you really think your hat will realistically sell for what you/other people are pricing it at? If not, lower your asking price.

Price intelligently. Undercut the market for profit, or if you see a gap in the market then target it.

Promos are king, unfortunately. Try to obtain them as part of deals, even an extra 1 earbud for every trade you do will increase your buying power.

**Conclusion**

I hope you enjoyed reading my guide and gained some insight into how unusuals are priced. Keep in mind that almost all unusuals are worth at least 1 earbud, with the exception of some truly awful hats, which are worth slightly less. If you ever uncrate an unusual, don't sell it for any less.",,False,,t5_2s0s4,True,,,True,t3_ocjn7,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ocjn7/a_guide_to_unusual_value/,

1357851589.0,59,self.tf2trade,16c35e,[PSA] Price Checking Unusuals and Backpack.tf (Long Post),64,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/16c35e/psa_price_checking_unusuals_and_backpacktf_long/,"*""How do I price check an unusual?""*

It's not an uncommon question.

*""Try backpack.tf!""*

It's not an uncommon answer.

Backpack.tf has quickly replaced spreadsheet as the de facto method of pricing items. it provides an amazingly high quality service, with community voting and a very accessible method of looking a price up and astounding up-time and up-to-dateness.

But with all that it does right, I feel backpack.tf has made a mistake when it set up a section for 'Unusual Prices'. 

There are a couple of things that I would like you to take away from this, even if you don't read everything.

1. Don't use backpack.tf to price check your unusual.
2. Backpack.tf *reports* prices - it **does not set them**.

This second one is important. If people set their prices according to backpack.tf the market will never move. Backpack.tf becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

In their defence backpack.tf have a statement at the top that people really should pay attention to:

&gt; Prices listed are suggested values only. Price may not always be accurate or updated. Should you not agree on a price, you are invited to use the adjust icon next to the item in question to submit a price suggestion. Recent price changes are identified with an indicator arrow.

Unusual prices move slower and they move in a completely different manner to other pries, effects rise and fall and Valve patch them and introduce new effects and as other items come into play (Crown and King of Scotland Cape as an example).

*""So how do I price check my unusual then, backpack.tf is the only place I know!""

I will answer that question in depth on another day. Not today though.

So I would like to present to you my rather lengthy explanation of why backpack.tf doesn't work for Unusuals.

---
Backpack.tf and Unusual Pricing: Why it's not a good source.
---


Backpack.tf is a fantastic and valuable service that quickly reacts to market change on most items, attempting to put a certain amount of proof behind any price change. It's tricky to do such a thing - you need not just proof of sale, but proof of how much it sold for. 

This is one of it's strengths when it comes to pricing most items. Items can't just be suggested to be a value, they must actually be *selling* for that value.

But when it comes to Unusuals, these technique don't always work. Why?

---
1: Unusuals are complicated
---

Unusuals don't usually go for keys or metal. Or even buds. Or other promos. Most of the time an Unusual is traded for other Unusuals. This somewhat undermines the ability to price check something. You can start tiering things, but all the prices are relativistic. 

If I trade, for example, a Scorching Bicorne for a Scorching Crown and a Vivid Plasma Party Phantom, you only get a certain amount of the picture. You know that to 2 people, this seemed like a good trade. But we don't know whether the Crown and Phantom that were traded were of equal or unequal value. 

Also, it's not uncommon for people to 'overpay' when one person doesn't want the unusual that they're being offered, but will accept it for the raw value. So who overpaid? The person with the Bicorne? Or the person with the Crown and the Phantom? Or was it truly even stevens? (English phrase)

Sweets also muddy the waters. It's not like pure keys, they're generally considered to be worth less than keys because keys are considered 'pure'. But the value is there, added into the trade. But do you include that in the price check? 

When someone got 'sweets' on outpost and they accept, we never know how much they actually got in sweets. I sold an unusual for 2.6 buds (2 buds, 2 bills) and about 1 bud in sweets. But on outpost it looked like 2.6 buds and sweets. They don't really know how much I got.

---
2: Manipulation.
---

So let's temporarily ignore the above problem and concentrate on a more worrying problem. Price setters.

I have a lovely Scorching Beret. But oh wait! Someone wants to buy it! What's the price I'm asking for? Oh just 7 buds. Not a problem they say! Well, since I'm selling it for more than what backpack.tf says it's worth I better make sure they're kept up to date and get some proof!

[Proof!!](http://i.imgur.com/WmcIT.png) - (there are at least 3 major errors in this photoshopped version of a trade, can you find them all?!)

A Scorching Beret does not go for 7 buds. No matter how much I would like it to.

I am the only person currently selling a scorching beret (as far as I know). There is another one on outpost, but it's declined all offers and isn't really selling - just letting it accrue offers. 

So, being one of the only people selling this hat I could quite capably say:

""With most of these hats off the market and a high tier effect, this hat has become significantly more valuable. I wish I could provide more proof, but this sold 2 hours after I put it on the market and there aren't currently any more on TF2 Outpost that's actually taking offers.""

*""Preposterous!""* - some guy who disagrees.  
*""Outrageous!""* - a different person who is quite vehement about this.  
*""Backpack.tf would never accept proof with only 1 or 2 data points.""* - someone who likes statistics.  

Well, that's where you're wrong. How do I know? [I've gotten a price change before](http://backpack.tf/vote/id/50a46e63ba2536d55b00018d). I got a price accepted with two links on an unusual. The price *was* wrong. It still is, I think a Green Energy Tavish Crown should be an easy 3 or more in my opinion. But hey, what do i know? I've only owned 4 Unusual Crowns.

With a small organised group it would be very easy to change the price of a couple of unusuals and make a good profit. Generally only ~30-50 people vote on an Unusual's price. It can (and sometimes does) get veto'ed, but this is not reliable. Prices have gone through that shouldn't have done and they will almost certainly continue to.


---
3: Data Points &amp; Quicksells
---

I briefly addressed this, but Unusuals don't get sold at the same rate as other items. Not only that, but a large quantity of the data points go completely unrecorded. A lot of unusual trading goes on on trade servers. This means that when we see data points from one place you're missing a the iceberg ot data that you don't see on Unusual Trading Servers.

Also garbage data can easily get easily included.

If 5 people see their absolute most incredible perfect I-will-never-sell-this Unusual Hat within a month of each other and all of them, for example, have Blizzardy [Bonk Boys](http://stats.tf/item/451/Bonk_Boy) and sell them at a discounted price we are given data for 17% of the market in a short period of time. That is a very significant portion of data.

If this information got submitted to backpack.tf we could see a price change be put into effect that would have serious repercussions for other owners. People price check with backpack.tf and get not the standard price, but the discount price. This ties in with something I said earlier.

&gt; Backpack.tf *reports* prices - it **does not set them**.

But people don't act like that. We like the idea of things have a set price. It's understandable. But it is also  wrong when it comes to Unusuals. (See section 5 for more on this from a different angle).

---
4. Voters &amp; Knowledge
---

When you vote on a price check, generally you do so because you have some knowledge of the item. Or at least I hope you do. I do anyway. 

This usually means one of the following:

1. You have owned and sold the item very recently.
2. You have bought the item recently after checking out various offerings.
3. You haven't owned the item, but you have been on a server where the item is being sold often enough that you get a reasonable sense of the average (mean/median) price. ^p.s. ^those ^who ^want ^to ^know ^the ^secret ^to ^making ^big ^profits, ^it's ^the ^times ^of ^uncertainty ^that ^you ^can ^make ^them.*

We cannot check this. I cannot prove that anyone else that votes on the items has any degree of knowledge. You could all be dogs for all I know, clicking random buttons. But generally speaking the community voting creates a form of consensus and group knowledge that allows us to make an informed decision together.

This is less possible with unusuals. There are fewer of them being sold. Several orders of magnitude smaller. At any one time there are only ever [8 Cloudy Moon Crowns](http://stats.tf/item/342/Prince_Tavish%27s_Crown) being sold. At most. What's the likelyhood of all 40 people all voting on the price change of a Cloudy Moon Crown actually knowing what it's like to sell one? Know the offers that were given and received, what was put on the table and what was not?

When people price check unusuals with me (which happens a lot nowadays) I have to sometimes say ""I have no idea."" Because I've never been involved in any way with that hat - never even seen one sold. In fact, i specifically *don't* vote on unusual prices because I don't have any personal knowledge of a lot of hats. 

Off the top of your head, how much would you say an untradeable voodoo juju is worth? Without looking it up on backpack.tf. If you haven't owned a voodoo juju, chances are you don't know. If you haven't traded one within last month, whatever you just said is quite probably out of date and incorrect. This is what it's like having people who don't own or know a hat. Sometimes yes, we can make an informed decision. But a lot of the time, it makes no sense for someone who hasn't owned or tried to own a hat price checking the hat. 

---
5: Art vs Commodity
---

Unusuals also have one more facet, which I would like to talk about. This is somewhat trickier to explain. 

With most items, the market sets the price. Plain and simple. People have to compete to sell an item and generally there is a point where supply and demand find a market value which fluctuates as demand and supply does. Thus the market sets a price.

But with unusuals this is not always the case. Instead of competing to sell, people compete to buy. This is not always true, but it can be. 

Let us say that you are a circling hearts collector. Your collection is almost complete. All you need now is a Circling Hearts [Crones Dome](http://stats.tf/item/920/The_Crone%27s_Dome). You have 6 buds and you think that's a fair price. You find the seller and the seller asks for 25 buds.

You cannot go elsewhere. That item is 1 of 1. Perhaps another will be unboxed, perhaps it won't. There's no guarantee. If you want that item, you have to buy it from the person who owns it.

This is an extreme case, but it begins to display the difference between Unusuals and normal items. With some Unusuals this is not true (flies Jannissary Ketche anyone?) but with enough it is that the point is worth considering. If someone doesn't accept your price and no one else is selling, that item's price is what the seller sets it at, not at what the buyer sets it at.

This is somewhat moderated buy other sellers and generally sellers end up pricing their unusuals at similar prices - but when a whole load of them are taken off the market then the price is set buy the seller, not the market.

If you donate you get:

* A reserved slot! Join even though the server is full!

* Green [Donator] tag while typing in the server. Let it be known that you support the servers!

* Custom trails! Run around the trade server with an awesome custom trail of your choice! Edit your trail by typing /settings into the chat! 

* Experiment with the colours and different trail types, and find one that tickles your fancy!

* Both trade servers will have these perks, and more will soon follow!

The minimum donation amount is $10 for these perks or $26 for three months. These give you perks on BOTH trade servers.

Since March, I have been hard at work on this project, and after over [1,200](http://scrapbank.me/stats/) [users](http://scrapbank.me/users/), I am happy to say that it is finally ready to move out of beta^(TM).  
ScrapBank.Me is great whether you're a TF2 player or trader. With the 1:1 weapon swapping and scrapbanking service, you will always be equipped with whatever weapon you need the most.  
That's not to say I'm completely done coding this site! Oh no, not at all. There are still many features planned. What moving out of beta means, to me, is that I'm confident enough that the majority of bugs are fixed, neutered and spayed, sprayed with bug spray, and then thrown into a fire. Oh there's the odd ones that keep popping up, but I work hard and try my best to personally squash them as they come.

So to celebrate [ScrapBank.Me](http://scrapbank.me/) finally growing up, I'm hosting a **BIG**^(ish) raffle to thank all ~1,300 users for testing out and using the site these past months and reporting and helping squash bugs. Alright, cutting the crap...

**""You're just ripping off scrap.tf's ideas!""**  
Okay, so I kind of am, but at the same time, I've built [ScrapBank.Me](http://scrapbank.me/) to be different from the ground up. What I'm trying to do is take what's good and works, and improve upon it - like the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'll be frank with you - I like the site, I dislike its owners. I also have no problem with Jessecar96 - I think he's a mature, responsible guy.  
[ScrapBank.Me](http://scrapbank.me/)'s bots can bank **any type of item** (some restrictions apply), instead of each bot specializing in one certain type of banking. I found out during the beta phase, that as theorized, it allowed trading to be completed faster since you could buy/sell multiple types of items in one trade.  
[ScrapBank.Me](http://scrapbank.me/) **has no fees**. I'm really not about profit! I just want to provide a service for the average TF2 trader. **All [ScrapBank.Me](http://scrapbank.me/) bots base their buy/sell prices from backpack.tf's spreadsheet** to make things fair.  
What else is special with [ScrapBank.Me](http://scrapbank.me/) bots? You can **pay with items instead of metal**. This allows for 1:1 weapon and hat swapping, and if you owe the bot 2 refined, you can pay with a craft hat and 0.66 ref.  
[ScrapBank.Me](http://scrapbank.me/) also has a **leveling/points system** for the gamer within you - leveling up earns you ""Scrap Credits"" or ""Scredits"", which you can spend on tokens can increase your banking limits, give you priority for a limited time, and more absolutely free.

I am relatively new to this community, however I have been a trader for a fairly long time, on and off for 3-4 years. I have been scammed/ripped off countless times and thus have learnt the hard way how to make profits and how to not make profits. There is also a guide to avoid being scammed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jhyte/common_trade_scams_and_how_to_avoid_them/), however it seems to be rather dated. This site seems to have few recent guides on such matters and I guess I could lend a hand. I am not sure at what level to aim this at, as I have no idea of the experience of most of the traders here, however based on my experience on trade servers and outpost, I'd say that starting from the basics isn't a terrible idea. If this guide takes off, I'll be sure to update it and improve it when I have the time. Feel free to PM me advice or leave a comment about any mistakes/changes I should make.

*About me:*

I used to trade regularly a couple of years ago, however I cashed out to buy games and other things. Recently (about 5 weeks ago) I was loaned about $100 worth of items from a friend, which I have turned into [a fair bit more,](http://backpack.tf/id/76561198000068960) without resorting to sharking, scamming or similar dirty tricks. Just a bit of know-how, experience and luck. 

*****

**Miscellaneous things:**

It is helpful to make friends with trustable and more experienced traders for advice and perhaps in a quick loan for a great deal. To make trustable friends you need to be trustable yourself. Don't scam, don't try and rip people off, don't try and offend people or troll too much.

*****

**Some 'tools' of the trade**

*Trading Sites:*

[Outpost or OP](http://www.tf2outpost.com/) is one of the more used sites at the moment, basically where a fair amount of the action is.

The [Outpost Script by Vaicine](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/10orw4/psa_tf2outpost_toolbox_script_12_released/) is an exceptionally helpful augmentation to outpost. Allows you to search and view trades more efficiently, and hide annoying/not useful trades as well as the hordes of people ""buying quicksells.""

[SourceOP or SOP](http://forums.sourceop.com/forum/) is a place I don't use very much, but a lot of the higher trades are present here.

[Trading Post or TF2TP](http://tf2tp.com/index.php) is still rather active, however I prefer the user interface of outpost.

[Bazaar](http://bazaar.tf/) is fairly active, but in all honesty, the labeling of estimated price values on every item leads to a very sterile market, with little room for profit, and I rarely get any offers on the site.

*Spreadsheets:*

The bane of many of the pre-steam-trade-traders. They have cut down much of the scamming that was rather rampant, and allowed for a much more stable marketplace.

[backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf/pricelist)
I find that this is a thorough spreadsheet, with fairly accurate prices. However, there is a tendency for people to not accept these prices especially on trade servers. Selling for these prices on outpost is reasonably successful, as it often represents a true market value.

[TF2 Spreadsheet](http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.com.au/)
This is the default spreadsheet for most people, and many people will sell for these prices, regardless of their actual market value.

*Trade Servers:*

There are a whole bunch of trade servers which are, as the name suggest dedicated to trading. They can be found by scrolling through the list of servers, or typing 
""trade"" or ""trading"" or something like that into the search by bar in the server browser. Similarly unusual trading servers can be found by typing ""unusual"". Often these are based in Europe/America. 

*****

**A rough conversion of items:**
Promos/keys/metal are also known as ""pure currency"" and are often much more accepted than other items.
A brief list of conversions here; (if this is too basic just tell me and I'll remove it)

2 weapons = 1 scrap = 0.11... ref

3 scrap = 1 rec = 0.33... ref

3 rec = 1 ref 

2.55...-2.666 ref = 1 key

8-10 keys = 1 bills hat

26-28 Keys = 1 earbuds

2 earbuds = max head

9-10 earbuds = houwar which is the highest regular promotional item

Promos are items gained usually from pre-ordering a game or some other type of *promotion*. These include, not exclusively; earbuds, bill's hat, max's severed head, h.o.u.w.a.r, holiday headcase, b.m.o.c, big kill, etc. These are usually items that predate ""genuine"" items, with the exception of the holiday items.

*****

**Regular Trading**

*Buying items:*

It is important to understand a sellers' psychology, in order to understand how to get good deals. First of all you have to buy an item. You do this by exposing yourself to the market as long as possible to find good deals. Sometimes I just sit on a trade server while doing some work and occasionally glancing at the screen to see if any great deal has popped up. A less passive approach is to search for a small amount of items that you know you can buy and sell for a good profit, and try and own a majority of the market stake for that item. I once bought out almost every pink tosselcap on outpost and trading post that was under my selling price, so I would be the only seller, and I had the lowest price on the market. With people who specify their prices and *say they are firm* (with the exception of unusual traders) will most likely not take it kindly to you adding them on steam and offering on their items. If you are to offer on a trade, if you are paying pure currency, feel free to ask for a little bit less, so there is a profit margin for you. If you do it in the right manner, more often than not, people are often flexible enough to accept their price, since a reasonable guy with a reasonable price is a good person to trade with. I find that you can get **much better deals in game especially if you are paying with pure currency, than on trading sites**, so this is a good place to buy items.

*Selling items for a profit:*

**Note that this is more of an explanation of maximum profit, and is a little bit unnecessary to actually profit.**

When selling an item you need to understand buyer's psychology and some basic statistics (OH NO THE HORROR!). They want to do either three things with the item. **Use it, consume it or sell it**, roughly I'd say the proportions respectively of these people are 5:1:14, or 25%, 5% and 70%. When I say they want to use the item, I mean usually they want to wear it. Thus they are willing to pay full price (FP) or a little bit more (FP + 1 arbitrary unit). The arbitrary unit (AU) can be anything; a rec, a scrap, a weapon, a key and is tied to the value of the item. It is basically your profit margin for most items. It is often easier to find these buyers on a trading site. Occasionally they will be willing to pay slightly higher than full price, but it isn't enough to rely on the small proportion who do for most of your profits. Consumers are often people who are going to use the item to do something with it, apart from wear it. This includes, but is not limited to, crafting hats together, painting hats, renaming hats and so on. These people often realise that by doing so, they will lose the intrinsic value of the item, and thus will try and pay a little bit less (FP -1), but may not care about it and just pay full price (FP). Then there are those looking for a profit. Thus they will often be paying a low price (FP - 2 ~ FP - 1). If you have bought it for less than slightly underprice (=&lt; FP - 2) then you can easily flip it to these people for FP - 1 for at least an AU profit. What price you bought it for may determine whether or not you sell to a specific buyer. If you paid full price (FP) then you price your item at &gt; FP + 1 and search for the small proportion of people who are willing to pay more. I have found that the mean price you can get an item at is FP - 1, with a standard deviation of 1 AU. I found it optimal to focus on buying items at the price of FP - 1 ~ FP - 2. Thus at the highest range of your buying, you make a profit from 30% of the population, and at the lower end you make it from almost 100% of the population. Of course these numbers are highly speculative and may not correlate to any distribution found within a trading server. **Of course it is much easier to find type one and two buyers on trading sites.**

[Here's a **graphical explanation** for what I am saying.](http://gyazo.com/b9fff49ae968ff448569d0a7f71cfa93) This graph represents roughly the market for items. I am suggesting that you buy at FP - 1 and Sell at FP for **maximal consistent profit**, as in [this picture, where the pink is your sweet sweet profit, basically the **crux of my entire guide**](http://gyazo.com/5e2c3806c5474ed1e44082bd3f4de935), not only this is profitable, it is very **stable** and **consistent** and **safe** profits (with the notable exception of new items, which don't have a fixed FP, see my later section on ""new items"").

***TLDR;*** *Buy highly demanded items for slightly under the market price, which **usually** (not always) follows [backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf/pricelist) pricing (like 1-2 rec less for regular hats, or 0.5-1 key cheaper for nicer hats) and sell for market price for maximum profit/time.*

*Cutting your losses:*

Often you will find yourself with too many items to sell, or having an item that has suddenly dropped in price. This is when you cut your losses. Profit is based exponentially on what you have, i.e. the more you have, the more you profit you make. Thus it is often better to quickly sell some items in order to increase your total currency value (even at a loss of your theoretical currency value) as having currency allows you to make more profit than just trying to sell those damn 10 strange scatterguns you bought before the price crash for FP - 1. You should try and sell at FP - 2, or at a bulk discount, **as long as the recent profits you have made cover the losses incurred by the deal**. This ensures a smooth flow of items in and out of your inventory, allowing for maximum profit. 
*****
**Trading Strategies**:

Feel free to comment or message me with more suggestions here for this section.

*Scrapbanking:*

This is a very grass roots leveled trading method based on the simple premise, that people would like to buy certain weapons. Thus you can trade your scrap for two random weapons from other people, as the game only allows you to craft together two identical items (or of the same class?) in order to make a scrap. Thus you provide a service for the community. In return, you can sell a single weapon for a scrap (or 2 weapons) from the right buyer, who would like that item. Make sure that the weapons given are craftable, and it often helps to put the word scrapbanker in your steam name.

*Stranges:*

As stranges are often hard to sell, people will often sell for under the market value, allowing for profits of a scrap/rec or even a ref. This can be a good way to make a reasonable profit. However, this often isn't a very fast way to make profit, so you will have to be patient. The exception to this is of course the high range; salvaged, festive, botkiller stranges, which fluctuate in price greatly.

*Craft Hats:*

A craft hat is any hat that is craftable. This encompasses almost every hat/misc apart from the Ghastly Gibus/Alien swarm parasite and the halloween costumes.
It is reasonably easy to buy a craft hat for 1-1.33.. refined and either craft them together for the hopes of a nice hat, resell them for a true market price or trade two for a key, which you can sell for 2.55-2.66, which can be a few scrap profit. Nicer craft hats can go upwards of 2 ref. Buying these for a little under the market price and then selling for the market or just above can be a stable method of making profit. When selling, you should always consider offers in other items, as long as they are reasonably easy to sell and or more valuable. 

I traded a lot of craft hats near the start for good profit. The trick is to find a few hats that people really like. For me I found the Troublemaker's Tosslecap and the El Jefe are highly demanded hats. Even still with the tossle's tf2spreadsheet price at 2-2.66, it was easy to buy them on outpost/tf2tp for 2 and sell for a key or so. Paint can often increase the value of a hat, but is often tied to the popularity of the hat. For example a nice hat painted nicely will retain most of the paint's value when painted, for example, it was easy to buy a tossle with pink paint at 3.33 ref, and sell for 4.33. Craft items (apart from scrapbanking) is the safest way to make a reasonable profit, with prices fluctuating slowly and very slightly. 

*New items:*

These are high risk, high return items. I suggest you do not try this, unless you have a lot of free time, and are experienced and can afford to lose big time. This is basically when new items are released, and the true market price drops below what the spreadsheets say, so it is possible to get things for lower prices. A good example of this is the recent botkiller weapons. (Note this advice only applies for items that are relatively easy to get

*Marketing your hats/items for sale:*

This part deals with specifically how to sell hats on a trading site/server. On a trading site, for regular items to set things out neatly, with a list of prices. **People don't want to offer on regular items, regardless of their level/paint/etc** (exception is low/cool craft number). I cannot stress this point enough. Just put a reasonable price, and more often than not people will take it. Add a link to your steam profile or a steam add link for convenience.

Another important thing to note for trading is *don't flood the market*. If you have purchased multiples of a certain item (with the obvious exception being promos), don't put up all of them at once. I've found that putting just one or two in a single trade of a certain item makes them seem much 'rarer' and appealing. If you are looking for a cool rare hat and you  see a trade, and this guy has 8 of them! You may think that the hat probably isn't that worth getting then. Not universally true, but it seems to be the psychology of many of the buyers. If you have a lot of a certain item; especially stranges, strange parts, keys (not so much at the moment, with the high demand for keys), selling them at a bulk discount will help move these hard to sell items, (and in the case of keys, is often an instant deal-winner). Just try to be sure that you aren't losing anything overall. **Losing potential profit, is not losing,** but by sitting on items for too long, you lose potential profit through opportunity cost.

*Etiquette:*

Thanks to BDS_USH for some more tips. 
&gt; 1. For the love of everything, do not add a person on Steam unless A) they specifically ask in their trade, B) you are willing to pay the exact price they have listed or their best offer, C) you are willing to give them some kind of massive overpay. It's annoying and embarrassing to be added by someone who is trying to lowball you or offer up something that is nowhere near the value you asked. No, ""ten refined worth of items"" is not the same as ten refined, just as ""ten dollars worth of groceries"" is not the same thing as a ten dollar bill.
2. Please don't be ""that guy"" who never updates their trade. If you are selling a number of items on Reddit/TF2OP/etc, please update the trade to reflect items you have sold. At best, you'll just annoy people. At worst, people will think you're trying to run a bait and switch.
3. Similarly, use SteamRep to determine a person's character before trading high value items with them. If someone seems suspicious, DO NOT TRADE WITH THEM. It's just a video game, there's no reason to rush into selling things to people without checking who they are first. Would you do that in real life?


*****

**Unusual Trading**

Will be expanded on later, when I have time/if I get a higher character limit.

Tiers:

A hat's value is based on three factors:

* Tier of the hat

Nicer hats, all class hats and misc hats are often higher tier, and thus will sell for more, however a low tier effect may still not be wanted. Soldier/Scout/Medic and perhaps Demo are the more desirable higher classes, as they are often most used and prominent.

* Tier of the effect

Nicer effect-&gt;more value, however often the hat determines price more significantly. Eg. A mid tier effect on a high tier hat often &gt; high tier effect on a mid tier hat. A rough list of effect tiers is [here](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Unusual_Hats#Effect_Tiers), however a recent trend is that weather (blizzard storm, stormy storm) have been decreasing in value significantly, due to a relative increase in unbox rate. Generally the older effects are valued higher, such as; sunbeams, scorching, burning, energies, plasma, hearts, ghosts.

* The Effect fitting the hat

Otherwise known as ""themed"", certain effects suit certain hats or classes. A classic example is the flies (low visibility on sniper), hearts on medic, ghosts on spy, or even a blizzard toque, which is winter themed. Certain themed hats can be worth significantly more than the combination of the hat / effect tiers. A rule of thumb of ""themes""; if it isn't obviously themed, it often isn't themed. Unless someone explains the theme and makes you go ""Oh wow! Why didn't I think of that?"", then most likely it isn't themed.

Unusual Prices:

Your best bet in determining an unusual's price is to search for it on a trading site, and see what other people are selling for. Assuming they aren't trying to quicksell, somewhere between the current offer and their buyout is the true value of the hat. As before when I talked about flooding the market, unusual prices can vary depending how many are being sold at once. If there is only one being sold, the seller can be quite liberal with his pricing. Of course nobody would pay for it if it was hugely overpriced, but he would probably still get more compared to if there were 5+ of the same hat on the market. Prices are all determined by supply and demand. High demand can increase a hats value, as well as low supply (very few being sold). And the inverse is also true, low demand can decrease a hats value, as well as high supply.

**RGBacon has asked me to put a warning here about making sure you check prices thoroughly, and don't rely on a single source to determine the true price.**

[backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf/unusuals)

This is a pretty reasonable site for unusual prices. It is usually accurate enough to prevent you from being hugely ripped off. However, as it is community based, there are obviously still price fixing issues to deal with. I have found that high tier hats are slightly underpriced, and low tier hats are slightly overpriced, however that may just be the slow economy.

[tf2 price check](http://www.tf2pricecheck.net/Forum-The-Unusual-Bible)

This is often very accurate as long as the latest post is dated recently.

*Unusual Strategy:*

Set yourself a target. Have a ""dream"" hat you want to reach. This is very helpful as it gives you a direction and focus in your trading. It allows you to break down a potential target which may seem impossible into smaller checkpoints. Be patient when selling an unusual hat and try not to rush into a deal without reliable advice, but don't sit on it forever waiting for an amazing deal unless you really like the hat. You often make more profit by keeping the sales goings, by just keep churning through hats.

*How to start unusual trading:*

to be added

*Unboxing a hat:*

It is worth noting that unusuals have an **equal** chance of being unboxed from a crate (unless stated differently by Valve), and [supposedly, the older effects drop more commonly, and perhaps from crates released before those new effects, i.e. crate 25 and lower, according to experienced unusual unboxers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/167wjm/psa_the_effect_of_an_unusual_does_depend_on_the/)

*****

***Unusual Marketing and Selling Strategies:***

Your preference when selling an unusual is almost always pure promos. Put a list of Current offers or C/o on your trade, so people have an idea of what is reasonable and put a Buyout or B/o price. Make your B/o slightly higher (like 0.5-1 buds higher) than the price you will be willing to take, as often people will be scared away from a buyout, but will try and find a middle ground, which is the true price you want.

However people expect to pay less for a hat (unless they want a hat to use) as they want a profit of this. This can most blatantly be seen by the hundreds of pages of people buying quicksells on outpost alone. Secondary to that is a mixed offer of promos and unusuals, where you plan to either take these and sell for promos or use it to upgrade to a nicer unusual than the one you originally had. Finally an unusual offer is preferable if they are trading you a hat you intend to keep, or slightly overpay you so you can make a reasonable profit. 

How you determine what value in unusuals to sell for is pretty simple. Take your realistic promo price, and compare it to the price you can get fairly easy of the unusuals being offered. It is often easier to get straight promos for 2 x 2 bud unusuals, rather than one 4 bud unusual. If they can be fairly easily sold for the same amount, (and aren't hard to sell hats) you should take it. Be realistic with your prices. Don't say ""this is my dream hat so you will pay twice as much as it is worth"". If you don't want to sell it, don't advertise it to be sold. Simple.

To work out how easy a hat is to sale, ask experienced traders and search the hat on outpost. Look for current offers on the hat to price it most accurately (be wary though of fake current offers). Nice Mid-tier hats move fairly easily, but cheap ones/really high tier ones are often harder to sell for a good price. 

Selling as a set is a good idea, but make sure that the items in the set aren't too highly valued. What I mean is people are more realistically not going to buy salvaged crate stranges / strange festives / high tier promos / weapons / stranges with an unusual. A good set is one that consists of the unusual hat and two complementing miscs, which are anywhere from 2-16 keys in value. If you want more for your hat, sell those things for promos/keys and put them in the trade, saying you have ""x earbuds, keys"" for upgrades.

*Sweets:*

*Screenshots:*

What better way to complement an unusual set, than a screenshot! There used to be an issue with having to give screenshotters your items, however that is not necessary anymore with Source Filmmaker. A good screenshot can draw a lot more attention to your set and is often worth the price. If you know of other good screenshotters, please let me know.

There are several screenshotters, but one person I have commissioned is [Dildo Baggins](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000203252). Some of his work can be seen [here](http://dildo-baggins.minus.com/).

Another screenshotter who is excellent is [Ty an Wobbi](http://steamcommunity.com/id/KFCCanada/). Some of his work can be seen [here](http://tyanwobbi.minus.com/).

These two guys helped with the last unusual raffle as well, and we're hoping to do one of these every month!

______________________________________________

Anyone is more than welcome to enter, but *please note* that we have the intentions of giving this hat to either a newer player/someone who is not overly TF2-wealthy and is relatively active on the sub-reddit.  For example: If you already have a couple unusual hats/nice promos and have experience with trading them, odds are you are not eligible to win (sorry =[ ).  If you're newer to the unusual market and/or only have maybe an earbud or two/equivalent in your backpack, that is perfectly fine and don't hesitate to enter!

Again, not to discriminate against anyone because the sole reason for this is to give back to the r/tf2trade community, but we'd prefer give this to someone who fits the previous description rather than merely increase the wealth of someone who already owns multiple buds/unusuals.  Ultimately Bean, Trec, and myself will decide where to draw that line.  

_________________________________________________

As for the actual raffle, rules are as follows:

1. Pick any number between 1-500

2. Come up with a unique number.  If two people were to pick #41, for example, the hat will go to whoever chose it first.

3. **Please do not enter if you are planning on reselling the hat.** I am going to over-emphasize this rule, as it would really suck to see this get turned into profit for someone when there's others who would enjoy wearing it.

4. Post a link to your steam page if it's not already in your flair (this also helps with evaluating everything previously mentioned).

__________________________________________________________

That should about do it! In order for everyone to have the chance to enter, I ask that you please **upvote this for visibility purposes!!**

The winner will be chosen on Friday around 11pm EST via www.random.org

Thanks and good luck to everyone!

**EDIT2:** Thanks [LPfmAAF](http://www.reddit.com/user/LPfmAAF) for your donation! 

I never wanted to do this, but /r/tf2trade, we need some money. Our monthly server fees are taken care of up to 2,000 GB of bandwith (Thanks Bacon and Team Railgun!). However, in a few hours [we will be exceeding 2,000 GB of bandwith](http://puu.sh/7a1T). Our trade servers use approximately 100 GB of bandwidth a day. Each GB over our limit, we get charged 10 cents. So each day we will have to pay roughly 10 dollars a day. 
***
**WHY**

The reason why this is happening is two fold: 1) we have a very active server and 2) we were DDOSed earlier in the month that chewed up a ton of data. 

[This is the guy that DDOSed us](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/j8e9e/rugc_trade_ingame_server_ban_appeal/c2mfsnp) as some of you will remember.

***

**WHAT WE CAN DO**

We are left with few options:

1. Get $60-70 to take care of data overage fees until end of the month

2. Shut down one of the trade servers and cut the player slots to 8 -  12 until the next cycle starts

3. Wait until we hit the max for this billing cycle and then shut down both servers until the next cycle starts.

***
**WHAT YOU CAN DO**

There is only one way to help right now. And, that is by donating money to the server.

Below are donation links. The top is a direct link to the server company. If you donate there, the money will be directly credited to our sever account. No one other than the server company will touch the money.

The bottom link is the Team Railgun Paypal account. Team Railgun fronts the cost of our server and has been paying 100% for it so far. If you donate there, Team Railgun will be able to access the funds and pay for our overages as well as potentially buying prizes for future server events.

As you may know, I'll be raising money for [Child's Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org), a charity that raises money to provide sick kids and outpatients with video games to help keep their spirits up. I'd appreciate it if you would make a donation when the time for the stream comes, or spread the word so that others might. 

I will be personally donating $50 per 100 people in the stream at one time (double the rate from last time), to a maximum of $500. This is concurrent viewers, and I'll use the highest value that I hit for the whole event. For example, if I have 300 viewers (the max I had at once last time) in the room when I start, and 1 for the rest of the event, I will still donate $150. 

When the unboxing ends, I will start crafting the hats and creating the raffles. For those of you who can't stay until the end, worry not! I will post the link to the raffles in the Steam group as well and leave them open for 24 hours. I may, however, have a few smaller raffles that happen during the stream. 

Keep in mind that I will have to leave for work the Monday morning of the weekend I am doing this, which leaves me only part of Sunday evening the actually hand out prizes. After that, I may not be available again until the 3rd or 4th of April. This sucks, but is an unavoidable byproduct of my job.

So I got bored and created a little (or not) spreadsheet.  This spreadsheet calculates the profitability (or not) of opening Mann Co. Supply Crates.

However, I could not figure out what to do with the 1% chance of getting ""An Exceedingly Rare Special Item"".  This 1% chance is really the only thing that could make these crates profitable.  If anyone knows what I should do about that, let me know.

Speaking of suggestions, if anyone sees anything wrong with anything (calculations, spelling, etc), please let me know.

Well, it's not all that big a deal.

Steam trade crashes at least once every day for me, and that's not including the busy times when it doesn't work at all.

In the past, I just kinda laughed about it and told my trading buddy that I'd just boot up tf2 and use that trading system.  Now apparently that's been taken out, and we're left with a slow, clunky, unstable, and unorganized Steam Trade to use in its place.

I want to know where to send a complaint about this, and if anyone else here cares about this issue...


Follow-up (22 hrs after OP): I think taking down tf2 trade TEMPORARILY to deal with duping is a good idea.  i wasn't aware of that issue at the time.  But I'd still like to see the old tf2 trade back eventually.  

However, the argument that steam trade was better in some ways than tf2 trade, so it's good that tf2 trade is gone, is just plain silly.  They both had advantages and disadvantages.  tf2 trade being taken down was bad mostly because it was stable.  There will be some points in time when we won't be able to trade at all because steam is down with this current system.

Firstly, thankyou to everyone who upvoted/commented on this thread to help make it reach the top of r/tf2trade. I've managed to find 11 interested buyers. With that many buyers, I was sure to get a good deal, and get a good deal I got.

Others offered unusuals, which were tempting, but this is the hat that I really want.

Preliminary offers were given, and I told everyone what the highest offer was, and that offer won as no one were willing to offer more. The offers were very close though, with someone offering 25 refines on top of the Max's.

The winning offer, for Deus Ex Human Revolution + Assassin's Creed Revelations, was:
---
Max (Waterlogged painted)
3 keys
Capo's Capper
Pocket Medic
Teddy Roosevelt
and a shitload of crates

Buyer's remorse is probably going to set in soon, as soon as I realise I've given up two good games for virtual items, but at the moment I'm over the moon.

PS: pigfat got the games in the end, he's a very helpful buyer, and I definitely would trade with him again.



~~I've decided that buying this hat will be much faster than trading up for it.~~

~~I'll trade approximately $90-100 worth of games for a Max's head.~~

~~If any of the games listed works for you, then add me. Otherwise, please leave a message below on what would make you sell your hat!~~

~~PS: Please upvote if you think its a good trade, as I really want this hat, and would like to increase my chances of finding a seller.~~

~~PSS:My rough calculations showed that it takes about an hour to make 2 refs worth of profit for me while doing the low tier trading I used to do. I earn well over that in my part time job. Decided to give up trading, play the fucking game, and just buy the stuff I need :P~~

~~And the hat will go to a good home, I will never sell it *cross my heart and hope to die*~~

~~Edit: wow, thanks for all the offers guys. Looks like I'll actually get my max today :) Its 7am here and I need to be at a lecture soon.

1361429673.0,58,self.tf2trade,18xx8j,[PSA] Be wary of prices on the Tux (and probably most untradable promos),69,11,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/18xx8j/psa_be_wary_of_prices_on_the_tux_and_probably/,"Now, I've been around the block when it comes to TF2 trading, I really have. I started trading almost two years ago and it both fulfills me and kills me on a regular basis. I have made some of my best friends through trading and I have seen some of the ugliest displays of impoliteness throughout these years and I swear the Tux promo is really doing it in for me.

**What's happening?** People are trying to inflate the price of this ~~shitty~~ penguin.

**But, why does it matter? People always try that and never succeed.** It matters because it's working. Look around outpost for trades involving the Tux. The offers range from a few refined to 10 keys with very little middle ground, *why?* It's because there are two types of users offering; those who are genuinely interested in the item but can't get Linux for whatever reason and those who own the Tux and are creating fake C/Os to bump its price.

***Here's what I've noticed*** Users offering way above current offers in the form of 7 keys+ while they:

a) Have cheap backpacks (albeit not a serious red flag)

b) Don't have enough keys

c) Are selling the Tux or own one themselves

**Okay, so people are doing this, do you think it will actually affect prices?** Well, lets consider the deal with the Holiday Headcase about a year ago. If you remember, one user was telling owners of the HH to raise their B/O and (correct me if I'm wrong) posted fake C/Os on other users trades in an attempt to inflate the price and it worked for a while. In fact, I think the price might still reflect the fake prices now.


**So a lot of talk/speculation. Where's the proof?**

1) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8686758 - offered 5 keys, owns a Tux

2) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8711812/ - epitome of scum. Hijacks other users threads. S. Ullapool looks legit. 6 keys is not. Also has the 6 keys guy running around posting on his friends' trades to top their C/Os.

3) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8775275/ Had to say something here. 

4) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8695508 Offered a painted bills by someone who owns one. Also, if you look at the item history of that user, you can see he's had the tux longer than the OP.

5) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8688842 Offered 8 keys by someone who owns a Tux

6) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8713526 Offered 20 keys....you guessed it, he owns a tux as well


I'm collecting more, but it's 2am here and I have a test in 12 hours. It's also tough as I'm browsing the new queue as it's not searchable.

**TL;DR** Traders are trying to inflate the price of their own items (go figure) by creating fake C/Os on other trades.  

 --------------------

**Adding something else that may be a good discussion, taken from my comment below:**

""Well this is actually completely unique in the sense of promotional items.

Buds were never untradable so as soon as one received them they could sell for whatever they wanted.

The tux is (i believe and please correct me if I'm wrong) the first initially untradable promo that is **not** genuine. The question is, will Tuxs be craftable once they are tradable. Most promos are released in the genuine version to distinguish between those received from the promotion and those crafted.

Take this for example: Bill's Hats, Earbuds, Essential Accessories, Lumbricious Lid, Portal 2 promos (despite some being genuine) are all completely uncraftable, which has made the the first 3 (well, somewhat with the EA) into what we generally refer to as ""promos.""

So **tl;dr** the price of the Tux is up in the air depending on whether or not it will be craftable. So the normal advice of trade as soon as it's tradable may not apply.

So I guess the real question is, will these reflect Bills/Buds, etc. or any other normal promotional item.""

The topic of the day today is sharking.

What is sharking?

Sharking is understood as paying lower than the true value of an item because the person who owns the item doesn't know the true value of what he or she owns.

Sharking is known as sharking because ""sharks"" hunt these unaware traders so they can take advantage of their lack of knowledge to score rare items cheaply.

What makes sharking bad?

At the moment it is generally understood that sharks are evil monsters who get off to the deals that they score and that they have no morals or pity. Potential socio/psychopaths welcome. (Also known as the Witcher 2 for Burning Ballcap).

Why is this the case?

Has anyone ever rationalized that the people who are trading these hats for these terrible offers are in full command of their motor functions at all times? Has anyone ever considered that the owner of the Burning Fruit Shoot who traded it for Railworks: Train Simulator maybe wanted Railworks: Train Simulator and asked for it? We enforce these ridiculous value structures on these virtual items for what purpose? Maybe a game is worth more than an unusual hat to some people. Who are we to say that they got “sharked.”

The thing that bites me about sharks though, is the lying. If someone outright says “Your Burning Fruit Shoot is worth Railworks: Train Simulator,” then that is a flat out lie. On the other end of the spectrum if I ask the owner of the Fruit Shoot what he wants for his hat and he says Railworks: Train Simulator, is it my responsibility to tell him that he could get one hundred copies of Railworks: Train Simulator for his hat? (based on current value structures).

To put into a real life context, I’ve recently been frequenting tag sales where I can (and do) buy a 3,000 dollar couch for 250 dollars. Is it my moral responsibility to let the owner know that I am getting an insane deal on a (very comfortable) couch? I would be out of my mind to spend 2,750 dollars more than I need to.

To get back into trading, I’m sick of all the promos, I’m sick of all the price checks, I’m sick of all the cash sales. The trading economy is falling apart and we have only ourselves to blame. Real scammers take advantage of the fact that we use rep to facilitate cash trading, hence impersonators. If everyone could just chill the fuck out and trade for what they want, values aside, it would be simpler for everyone.

God knows sharking already jumped the shark.

Love,

JJJJ (SR Admin, UTC Admin, TF2TP Admin, AF2 Admin, Sexual Deviant)

/r/TF2Trade has actively been pursuing scammers both within our community and trade servers. However, we have received a lot of messages to mod mail lately from scams from other places. 

Well, we hate scammers. And just because it doesn't happen on our servers mean we can't do something about it. As a member of [SteamRep](http://www.steamrep.com), our scam bans are banned across all SteamRep.

**[Common scams are listed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jhyte/common_trade_scams_and_how_to_avoid_them/)**

Misrepresentation Scams: If someone represents something one way and it turns out not to be that way, that is a misrepresentation that amounts to scamming. In legalese, the ""risk of loss"" is on the buyer. However, the buyer must reasonably inquire to find out what they are purchasing. If they do not, then it is not scamming if they did not get what they thought they were getting for failure to ask.

**Examples**

1. Bill says his hat is worth 4 refined. It is worth 2. Jim does not research the hat, but buys it. He finds out later it is worth 2 refined. This is **not a scam** because Jim had a duty to find out what the price was before purchasing.

2. Bill says his hat is craftable. The trade window does show whether or not a hat is craftable. There is no way to determine whether a hat is craftable or not other than the seller's word. Jim buys the hat and then finds out it is, in fact, not craftable. This **is a scam** because Bill misrepresented his hat as being craftable when it was not.



***
To report anyone for scamming, please reply to this thread. Include the following:

1. ALL of the scammer's steam IDs as identified by [SteamRep](http://www.steamrep.com)

2. The victim's Steam ID

3. Evidence in the form of screen shots or other trustworthy forms

4. Witnesses, if any

5. The items that were scammed

***

Not every report will result in a ban. But, hopefully we can make a dent in the scammer population.

Too often people lose out massively when they are trying to trade their unusuals away with no prior knowledge.



First of all, go to SourceOP.com and see if you can find the hat you unboxed. This is absolutely vital, get a proper check on how much your hat is worth.  And, no matter how pretty that other guys hat is, do a pricecheck on it. You could be losing out on a lot of money, sometimes hundreds of dollars. 

One other major tip: don't let the other trader pressure you. Don't listen to them if they tell you your hat is 'crap', they only want to get it out from you as cheaply as they again. [Sharks](https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B5HnYvVrpRZSZTI2NDdhZGItNTBhMi00OTBhLTk1N2UtNzQ5YThiYjUzNGVi&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1) also will probably want to buy your hat, they employ tactics which involve trying to relate to you or stuff you like, overvaluing their own items and being deceptive. 

Last week I lost about $50 because the person went through my profile in order to determine stuff I liked to talk me into giving him my hat for less, I was fine with it until I found out he was just lying in order to get me to trade. 

***
*Notes:*

* Buds are roughly $25-28, (~15 keys)

* If your hat can only be found in $$$ then divide it by 26~ to get the value in straight buds. (Multiply by ~26 to get the value in $$$ etc.)

* 0.5 buds is roughly a Bill's hat + 1-2 keys, or 15 refined

* Before trading, check up on steamrep.com to see if they are noted as scammers, it'll help a lot.

INSTALLATION
----

**Firefox**

1. **Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).** Greasemonkey is a Firefox extension that allows userscripts like mine to work. It's been around for a long time (and isn't a virus, promise!)

2. **Restart Firefox.** Greasemonkey won't be installed until you restart.

3. **[Download the script.](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/112566)** ([Tf2items version](http://userscripts.org/scripts/version/112566/373890.user.js)) Greasemonkey will install the script and when you hit refresh, you'll see it in action. Hopefully. Or maybe you'll see a Youtube video of King Kong fighting Godzilla. With Firefox, it's all up to you!

**Chrome**

1. **If you have a previous version of the script, uninstall it.** This is especially important in Chrome, as the new script will be installed under a script manager and won't overwrite the previous version.

2. **Install [Blank Canvas](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pipnnjjknlabchljabhmnpdfpdobpnkk) (or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)).** Originally this userscript ran fine in Chrome, however it now relies on Greasemonkey functions that can only be found in script managers such as these. I went with Blank Canvas.


3. **[Download the script.](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/112566)** ([Tf2items version](http://userscripts.org/scripts/version/112566/373890.user.js)) Make sure that your script manager of choice is doing the heavy lifting, and not Chrome itself.

~~**Opera**~~ *(Opera support has been temporarily suspended with 1.2)*

**All you have to do is leave a link to your Steam ID in a comment below**. That's all I need to write your name on a slip of paper and place it into a hat. If I happen to draw your name from said hat on Friday night, this will make it far easier to get in touch and deliver the prizes.

Now, that's good and all, but what about those of you with a little metal to throw around?

Around 5-6 months ago, a small guy named /u/Strafeh met up with /u/Cheesydude and asked for his help to make a new sub.

A sub designed with friendships and connections in mind, along with giveaways to unite us all in friendly giveaways. With /u/MagicalKillaCow as our first ""public"" moderator who helped us to spread through his YouTube Channel and a few x-posted raffles from /r/TF2Trade and /r/tf2, we managed to grow to a community of 1.25k subscribers around a month ago.

However, in an attempt to try to increase our subscribers, I started planning a HUGE raffle, called the Community Raffle. With 2 weeks of donations from not just /r/RAOTF2 members, but also from /r/mylittlefortress, /r/TF2trade, and /r/tf2, we managed to scrounge up a total prize pot of **8.5 buds**.

There's a bunch of different ways to gift your giftee their gift! 

1. You can add them on steam through your main steam account and simply trade them their gift. 

1. You can make a new steam account and name it ""x's Secret Santa"" and trade that account your items you want to gift, then have your giftee add that account. Non-premium users can't add new friends, but they can accept friend requests, so you'll have to ask your giftee in a reddit PM (use an alt here too!) to add that specific account. 

1. You can gift wrap the item and send it to them if you're both on the same server - no need to add them, just click ""send gift"" in your TF2 backpack and select your Secret Santa to gift it to them! 

1. You can add them on steam and gift them a game with a message included if you want to gift steam games to them. 

1. There's loads of ways to do it, be creative and most of all have fun doing it!

* How do I find out what to gift my Giftee? 

1. Try doing a search for their reddit username in /r/TF2fashionadvice, /r/TF2, /r/tf2trade and check their current posts on TF2Outpost &amp; TF2TP.com to see what they may be desiring. 

1. Make sure you check their TF2 gameplay stats to find out if they play a main class (e.g. http://steamcommunity.com/id/IMACTUALLYACRATE/stats/TF2 obviously *loves* spy). Get them something for their favourite class! 

1. If you can't find anything on their reddit account or steam profile, send them a PM using a throwaway on reddit asking them their favourite class! 

1. You could also check their Steam wishlist (e.g http://steamcommunity.com/id/IMACTUALLYACRATE/wishlist) to see if they want any games if you are gifting them games.

------------------

* What are the consequences of someone being a Bad Santa and taking gifts but not giving them? 

Gaming the system or intentionally receiving and not giving is considered an act of dishonesty that will result in the offender being marked a REDDIT SCAMMER by SteamRep. I don't want to have to do this to anyone, so please don't be a Bad Santa :(

1354723387.0,58,self.tf2trade,14bs3q,"[PSA] Grey's Guide to Max Heads: Levels 1 &amp; 7, the Duped and the Gifted",69,11,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/14bs3q/psa_greys_guide_to_max_heads_levels_1_7_the_duped/,"So, I've been meaning to write this piece for a while. It's a small essay on the pricing of the 'promotional item' known as the ""Max's Severed Head"", the unwillingness of the market to pay market price for the item when it is level 1 or 7 and whether the market pays for duped versions of this items, regardless of level.

---
**Duping, so what is it?**
---

When an item is 'duped' it has been replicated using an exploit/glitch to make more than one version of an item. The second version retains the 'Original ID' of the item and is identical in every other way. Theoretically speaking duping an item reduces its value because it changes the amount of supply in the supply/demand curve. 

With the Max's Severed Head, at some point someone figured that these items were in limited enough supply that by replicating it over and over again they could make a large amount of money.

It is also 'known' that the level 1 and level 7 versions of the Max Head were the most duped and have secured themselves an infamous history, the likelihood being that if you got a level 1 or 7 it was more likely to be duped that not - that was how common the duped versions were.

This, so far, is all common knowledge.

What is less commonly known is that all the Max's Severed Heads had their histories wiped by Valve, resetting the histories such that the level 1 and 7s were as clean as any other level. If you cared about the item history, it should no longer be a problem. But of course… it is. Level 1 and level 7 Max Heads are still looked down upon in the trading community, seemingly worth less than the usual Max Head. 

So, does it deserve this? If the history has been wiped, what matter does it really make?

Let's look at some statistics.

---
**Statistics**
---

According to stats.tf and backpack.tf we find the following:

Max's Severed Head currently sells for ~2 buds

* In 3,047,803 scanned inventories, 8,479 copies of this item exist, just 0.28% of all items.
* 9 are of the Vintage quality.
* 24 are of the Self-Made quality.
* 31 are not crafteable.
* 78 have gift text &amp; 1 is inside a carefully wrapped gift.

If we then look at the [statistics page of the Max Head](http://stats.tf/item/162/Max%27s_Severed_Head) we can break down how many of each level exist and find out just how badly duped the Max's Severed Heads was during its duping heyday and the results are rather surprising.

The average (mean) quantity of a Max heads at any given level is  84. So unsurprisingly when we look at the quantity of level 3, 4 and 5 Max Heads we find:

* Level 3 - 76 exist
* Level 4 - 83 exist
* Level 5 - 87 exist 

All fine and dandy, nice and within range. In fact, this trend continues throughout most of the Max Severed Heads of Unique quality.

---
**Level 1: The Easiest Level**
---

Now let us look at the level 1 Max Heads and 

* Level 1 - 1208 exist

There are 14 as many level 1 Max Heads than average. This item at this level was duped so many times that it makes up 14% of all Max Heads, not 1% as it should.

For me, this is the reason why I now don't value a level 1 Max Head as highly as other levels. It has nothing to do with duping. It has to do with supply and demand. There is a *much* larger supply of level 1 Max Heads than average, driving the value down significantly. It is by far and away the most common Max Head.

In fact, there are so many of the level 1 Max Head, when we remove level 1 from the equation, the average quantity of a Max Head at any given level drops from 84 down to 73.

---
**The Shadow Effect**
---

So, how about level 7 Max Heads? Level 7 Max Heads are also notorious for being duped. But when we look at the figures...

* Level 7 - 68 exist.

No, really. There are fewer level 7 Max Heads than average. There is no good reason for a level 7 Max Head to be worth less than a level 1. Except, of course, that the marketplace is full of sheep. By the time that the histories had been reset, it was too late for the level 7 Max Heads. Its history had been tarnished. 

When we look at a chart of quantity of Max Heads at every level, [this is what it looks like](http://i.imgur.com/NOBDY.png). It is utterly staggering how large a quantity of Max Heads are level 1.


*Apologies with the graph for not labeling each and every bar with its level, it's 1 to 100 left to right. Unfortunately the numbers were constantly overlapping and it was completely unreadable*

So, what's the conclusion? The price of a level 1 Max Head is decreased for a damn good reason and should, accordingly, stay that way.

The reduced price of a level 7 Max Head is completely unnecessary and now unfounded. A below average quantity exist and the price should be considered to be the same as any other level (excluding level 1). Unfortunately, I am not sole arbiter of pricing of items so I cannot do anything about it. Perhaps, neither can Reddit as a community. 

The only thing we can do is propagate this knowledge. Share the stats.tf page freely and invite people to look it up for themselves. When you advertise that you're buying Max Heads, put your reduced price for level 1 but not for level 7. 

---
**Other duped levels of Max Heads**
---

*So, what about the other levels? Do dupes not exist?*

Of course they exist. It's just that the duping wasn't as prolific. But a duped Max Head matters far less than a duped unusual. Why? Again, supply and demand.

There are usually between 10 and 40 of a given hat/effect combination. The effect of duping an unusual hat is significant upon its price. However it is *not* significant on the price of a Max Head (unless you do it to the point where the market is saturated with a single level).

I value duped Max Heads at the same price as unduped. In my experience, you will find that 95% of unusual traders will act similarly.

---
**So what about about gifted Max heads?**
---

This is a different kettle of giraffes altogether. Gifting is the use of the gift wrap item (available in the store) to give an item to someone else. Gifting an item permanently emblazons your name on that item (unless the item is regifted).

The reason for gifted items having a lower value is that the gift text can never be removed. It will, from now and forever more, have the text 'Gift From...' on it. Aesthetically, this isn't a problem for most people. But when the gifter's name means nothing to you, it is naught but an annoyance. Rightly, the value of the item is now decreased, like an art piece that has had an owner squiggle his/her name on the back. It might not be visible to anyone else, but it is still tainted.

Further to this, it is known that one of the methods of 'duping' an item is using gift wrap. So not only is the item marked, it is also probably not the original.

I'm sorry those who were hoping for better news - gifted is worth less for good reasons.

---
---
**TL:DR** 
[Max Heads level 1 should be worth less, Max Heads level 7 shouldn't be.](http://i.imgur.com/NOBDY.png) Duped doesn't matter. Gifted does.

There's been quite a number of ""Stranges for cheap"" threads, which have not a single item priced or ballpark. Some folks are advertising ""for cheap"" and after you've had to track them down, message them, let them know you found them through reddit, they're actually sticking firmly to the spreadsheet price or higher. This wastes a lot of peoples' time. Please do not do this. This subreddit is quickly feeling like any other trade server - ""Make me an offer"". Ok, well you're going to reject anyway, so how about you, as the seller, designate the starting point.

This isn't craigslist, I'm not negotiating a new refrigerator here people. This is a video game. So let's not waste any more peoples' time than is necessary. :)

**PS.** For those of you who have posted and sold your backpacks to your follow redditors with no hassle and at fair prices, thank you. You're doing your part in making this a great place to learn about and to enjoy trading in TF2. Thanks

That is all 

**EDIT** I'm not flaming sellers who are looking to make a profit, or people who list so much that it's too tedious to price everything. The broader point, is that it is encouraged to set an expected ballpark or range for specific items (ie. reg weps, vintage weps, craft hats, vintage hats, etc). And if you ask for offers, don't be disrespectful to someone who has made a reasonable offer, as they've spent their time adding you, waiting for you to be online to give you business. I felt like this was something that needed to be brought up since there has been a wave in the last week or so of these stores that request offers only.

* One massive community for events and charity drives.

* Unified and simplified rules across communities. You know what will be expected of you no matter where you go - no surprise rules. (This will take some time to implement.)

* Cross linking subreddits. Each participating subreddit (soon) will have links that cross link to other participating subreddits. 



* Unified reporting and appeal system. Check out the [cross community reporting/appeal system here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bans). Eventually this will be the only way to report/appeal for /r/tf2trade.

* There will be a shared ban list across each community that participates. This way we can put a real bite into a subreddit ban. Further, if applicable, SteamRep tags may be applied if the offense was scamming.

* In the works is a full service website that will aggregate all open trades in one easy to read place.

**How To Participate**





-pick a number from 1 -2000





-**don't be greedy** If you already have a lot of stuff, don't participate. I will look through everyone's backpack. 










-I will announce a **winner** on 8/4/12 or 8/3/12 if I have more time. 







-there will only be one winner. Also, I'm cross posting this to reddit.com/r/tf2.






**EDIT**: there has been some confusion. **There will be only one winner**





**EDIT** I keep editing this and adding more stuff.... I've decided to give away my entire backpack (except for some weapons that I want to keep....) So, on top of everything above, whoever wins gets most of my backpack. I know what this is worth. I've traded and accumulated this over a long time and through different accounts. I won't regret this.

1333891955.0,59,self.tf2trade,rz6tk,[PSA/Q] Who runs the spreadsheet and how can we trust them?,74,15,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/rz6tk/psaq_who_runs_the_spreadsheet_and_how_can_we/,"The spreadsheet should only be used for rough pricing, but increasingly more nowadays, people are using it as the be all and end all of pricing goods. I've had people reject offers simply for being ""below spreadsheet"", when in reality if they did a simple search on /r/tf2trade or something, they'd see that noone was buying for the spreadsheet price, and it was out of date. 

All this means that the price the spreadsheet gives for items is becoming more and more important to trading - I'm sure if the spreadsheet gave a price which was vastly inflated from what an item is actually being sold for, and the 'manager' of the spreadsheet tried to sell that item for a price somewhere between its 'actual' value and the false spreadsheet value, he wouldn't have too much of a problem.

I looked on the spreadsheet ([this](http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.co.uk/) is the one I'm referring to here, there may be others) and couldn't find any information on who runs/controls it. How can we trust them?

Lastly, I think the system of a single spreadsheet controlled by a group of people needs to die. The data it provides is very useful, as its tricky to have a rough idea of what every single item is worth in your head all at once. 

What could be one solution is using data from a website such as tf2outpost (easier than TF2trade since everything's in a kind of standard format), for each item an average buy and sell price is calculated from recent offers/successful trades (slightly more like the stock market?). This would be influenced by the community, and could respond to jumps in price (for example s. kritz after #30 stopped dropping) very quickly. It would also reflect that there *is* always a difference in price between what people are buying for, and what people are selling for (ideally, that is).

This is all just ideas and guesswork, so please comment with your thoughts (and info on who runs the spreadsheet, if possible)

_________________________________________________________
So, by now, everyone has likely heard of Valve’s hiring of a resident Economist, to study the in game TF2 Economy and now likely the burgeoning DoTA 2 economy as well. Well, this is intended to be sort of a crash course, not only on how to make money within the trading that’s developed, but also the history of said economies, and what exactly makes them tick.

***Introduction***

So, to start off with, let’s look at the current currencies in place. Namely, (In order of value) Metal, Keys, Bill’s, Buds, and HOUWARs. The last one, HOUWARS, I have no experience in, and are rare enough that they will not really come up unless in god tier Unusual trades.
Metal is a currency tied to one main thing: time. It used to be tied to the time that people spent playing the game, and is now tied to that as well as something more regulatory: Hats and crafting. There is a large amount of speculation regarding idlers and their influence on Metal’s value, but in my opinion, it is just that: speculation. The reason that metal and hats are important is crafting. Metal, along with the weapons needed to make it, can be used to create either weapons or hats. Hats, as generic value, are accepted at 1 ref and 3 scrap, a seemingly arbitrary number. However, if you look at the other crafting recipes, you’ll notice one titled “Build Headgear”. It costs either 3 ref, or 2 hats via “Rebuild Headgear”, to make 1 hat. Therefore, the value of hats cannot exceed this 3 ref: 2 hats ratio, else people would have no reason to buy the other. As it so happens, a difference of a reclaimed is enough to convince people to trade for hats rather than craft them, and 3 – 1/3 = 8/3, and half of that is 4/3, or the 1.33 people are so used to paying for a ‘craft’ hat.

***Keys***

Keys are an altogether trickier proposition. They are not, like metal, a ‘fiat currency’, which is to say  currency because everyone agrees it is one, but rather are only made when someone buys one in the Mann Co store. This means that at the most, a key is worth $2.50, the amount needed to make a new one. The general equilibrium that settled pre- Beta market/Halloween was that 5 ref was roughly 2 keys, heading upwards to 2.66 ref. With the convergence of 3 things, Keys began to rise in value relative to metal. What 3 things? The first was Base64’s discovery of carders injecting vast amounts of keys illegally into the TF2economy by purchasing stolen credit cards, trading them into mule accounts, using those keys to trade for Earbuds, then selling those Buds for cash, hemorrhaging value along the way. Who in their right mind would buy keys for 2.50, trade 30 of them for a Bud that was worth around 26-27 keys at the time, and then sell said bud for a large loss? Valve caught on soon after Base64’s PSA, and banned and locked several accounts, and stymied that inflow of keys. The second event was the 2nd Halloween event. Even though the event special Eerie keys were popular at the time, normal key already in circulation at the time were still able to uncrate the lucrative Halloween effect Unusuals. This meant that while more keys were being introduced to the market, many more were being consumed, as well the ones that would have normally been traded were now being used. Seems fine, increased demand, but there was increased supply as well; prices should equalize after the event, right? Not exactly. The introduction of the Steam Community Beta Market meant that keys could now be purchased with far more security than paypal trading (strike one for stability), keys that would normally re-enter trading from being sold via paypal would now float around (since the Beta Market removes the tem from your backpack until it’s sold, making it useful crate storage) in limbo until sold (strike two), and most significantly in my opinion, keys were no longer limited to two uses, namely trading and paypal or uncrating (strike three). While people did trade keys for games, the market there was based off of sale prices from the games and the paypal value of keys, roughly $1.25 at the time. Well, the convergence of all of these meant that metal was no longer as desirable, and keys sorta entered a free fall in terms of pricing, but more on that later.

***Bill’s***

Bill’s Hats are a good example of a fiat currency. No, not like the car. It’s a currency solely because people say it is. Paints on it don’t count for as much though; Team Spirit and such add .5-1 key, and Black and White paints (NOT After Eight) add 1 key to the value, which is currently 7.5-8 keys. Why is it an effective currency? Well, there’s a limited amount since more cannot be created, people like the hat, and it’s been around for a while. Well, why not just make a Genuine hat into the next currency, you might ask? People did try that, with a controlling amount as well (70-80% of the owners banded together), for the Genuine Archimedes. But people can be ornery, and simply refused to accept it once they realized it was attempted manipulation. More on why said hats can or cannot be a currency later.

***Earbuds.***

 One of the most popular hats, primarily because it was available for a veeery short period of time, only a weekend, it’s been around for a while (since before trading was there in TF2) and they were the first hat/misc to have an effect, no matter the visibility. Currently, they fluctuate between 22 and 25 keys (Current price as of 7/7/2013 is 23 keys), or a range in between there. Not much to say here, so if you have anything to add, drop it in the comments and I’ll throw it up here.

***HOUWARs.***

Much like keys, they’re an effective currency because of the USD value tied to them, with the games people had to purchase and play in order to ‘earn’ them. Why not Treasure or Bounty hats? Well, simply put, they’re too many of em. And they’re too unstable. As of this time (and correct me if I’m wrong) they’re worth 11 buds.
Now, a lot of you might be asking “Why isn’t hat X (Genuine Archimedes, the Tux, Holiday Headcase, other random hat) a currency?” Well, the reason is relatively simple. A currency needs to be accepted by a large number of people (bye bye Archimedes) have a relatively stable price (See ya, Headcase), and be tradeable in some fashion (toodles, Tux. At least, for now). “But keys aren’t stable” you cry, “they’re metal mongering heart breakers! 2.66 ref! 2.66 ref!” Well, they are stable. Since October 2012, Keys have gone from $1.25 paypal to $1.35 [EDIT: At about $1.85 right now (7/7/2013), which matches the pace of USD inflation], and remain constant relative to Bill’s and Buds. That 10 cent increase is barely enough to account for inflation of the USD since then, making them pretty darn stable. Rather, it is *metal* being unstable that’s the problem at hand. It’s fallen from $0.50 since October 2012 to $0.35 and dropping right now.
Now, that’s the basic of each currency. What’s the point of all that, and why do you care? Well, you care because TF2’s like the Foreign Exchange when it comes to its items. You don’t really have a set value on a currency, and so you’re not really gaining or losing money as much as swapping one kind for another. Why is that important? Well, metal is weak relative to keys, and keys are strong relative to Buds. Therefore, you can buy Buds for metal, and swap for keys, rather than undergo all the steps in between and risk losing money. Assuming, of course, you find a willing seller. Which brings us to our next topic.

***Trading Sites***

Outpost, Trade.tf, Scrapbank.me, Scrap.tf, Backpack.tf, /r/tf2trade, and other assorted trading means. What’s the best way to use them? The fact remains, that (apart from backpack.tf’s pricing suggestions) they serve one basic purpose, which is to connect buyers and sellers. Outpost is, for me, a go to place to either post up high value goods such as Unusuals and rare Stranges, or to purchase specific items at a low price. The sheer quantity of trades upon Outpost selling any given item means that using proper methods (skip the first 2 pages, expand notes not the link itself, and scan quickly before expanding the notes) you can quickly find specific items of low value quite cheaply. Now, I’m not saying you’ll score craft hats for 1 ref each or anything like that, but you can, given a quick browse and a bit of luck, find items of low value (think assorted stranges) for .33-1 ref below market price. Not enough of them to make ‘money’ flipping them, but enough that you can use it to fill out loadouts quicker and cheaper than posting Buying trades. Backpack.tf, famous for its pricelist and voting, has recently introduced classifieds into its list of services provided. This is great if you’re trying to find a rarer item, or one whose price is accurately reflected by backpack.tf yet. For example, if you’re trying to find a S. Sandman, and all you see is people selling them for 2.33, but backpack.tf days 1.66-2 ref, you head to the classifieds, and hope someone was looking to sell theirs fast. /r/tf2trade is a fantastic resource on finding items at market or slightly below market value, and for meeting high profile traders and polite individuals. Use it to post up items you’re reselling, have time for, or to find paypal trades as well as PSAs and questions. Keep in mind though, that the trade severs of /r/tf2trade, while patrolled by Mods and Admins such as [RG]Bacon, Hoovy Santa Guy, Elite, 007, Solid Scout, and others, are not always as polite as the subreddit. Use it and other trade servers to sell medium value items (1.33 ref to 4-5 keys) as well as buy things on the cheap. In a trade server, look for people selling items with no set price, one that is low, or that are using voice chat to advertise their trades; these tend to be the people that, like Kestrel, Chris Kirkman, Jadinko, myself, and others, are keen upon volume rather than price of small items, meaning you will be able to haggle more effectively. Also, they tend to be playing and trading for fun, not to try and push you for that last scrap, so it pays to get to know them and the server’s regulars.

***Effective Sales***

Now, the most effective way to do large amounts of trading is to categorize your buying and selling. Unless you’re after some specific item, don’t spam chat with “BUYING ITEM X” or “BUYING QUICKSELLS”: people tend to catch the idea after a couple of posts. Same goes for /r/tf2trade, Outpost, and backpack.tf. This subreddit has a limit on how often you can post, and Outpost has restrictions on how often you can bump your trade as well as rules against posting the same item for sale twice. In general, you want to use the following division:

* Outpost, post high value buying and selling trades, anything above 8 keys. Go to Unusual trade servers if you really must.

* /r/tf2trade, backpack.tf, Trade.tf for medium value items, ranged between 1.33 ref and 5-6 keys. Something that needs more time to sell, and the requisite interested parties to have some cash at hand.

* Trade servers for low end stuff worth around .11 to 1.33, as well as (important part here) *buying* stuff. You gotta have something to sell, and if you’re just another quickbuyer on Outpost, you aint gonna stick out at all. Trade servers you really have the chance to haggle.

* Scrapbank.me and Scrap.tf for banking services, such as 2 weps to a scrap, or 1.33 for a craft hat. Pretty self explanatory, just save you a bit of time on a hat you don't want.

Second... [**Zaffaro**](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zaffaro) with a number of 0404! Congrats, Zaffaro!

Thirdly... [**sossego!!**](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048716603) He picked the number 0869!

And finally... [**BurningChildren!**](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043861734) He picked the number 0231!

Congratulations to ALL! But one thing before I go: sossego was the ONLY winner that *actually* chose the item he wanted in his comment. I guess that proves how much everyone pays attention to our **RULES!** We try to do good things for this community, but sometimes you guys really make it hard! Oh well, enjoy your items, guys!

Oh, and join our [group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JINX_CLAN) and join the group exclusive raffle [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JinX_Clan#announcements/detail/1317563420536832763), and invite ALL of your friends, because that's the ONLY way the raffle will actually happen! 

Bye.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey /r/tf2trade, you lovely bunch you! How are you today? Oh, well that's just fine! Oh, I'm doing good myself, thanks! What's that? You want me to continue with the raffle?

... Oh.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week's raffle will include a few **BEAUTIFUL** items, for you, and only you to enjoy (If you with them, that is.)! They are:

**Strange Part: Domination Kills** - This cool little gadget will enable you're stupid, petty little Strange weapon to track not only kills, **BUT** the dominations you get with the weapon! Noice.

**A Track Terrorizer** - This sexy jacket will have all the girls chasing after you... Quite litterally *chasing* you... Because you're a scout? Get it?

**A Sober Stuntman** - Protect your Demoman with this stylish, sexy piece of helmet goodness. Not sure if you care about craft names (it is crafted by me), but I will remove it if desired. 

And last, but certainly not least... **Flair!** - Give your class some flair with these sexy badges, you can even put **YOUR VERY OWN PICTURES ON IT!** Amazing, if you ask me.

*Quick Note:* Make sure, along with your number and profile URL, tell me out of **ALL** these beautiful items, which one you would like!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the rules:

**Post a number between 1 and 1000 in the *0000* format.** Example: 0532 for 532.

**Up-vote the post for visibility!** Seriously, we want everyone to have a chance to win something! As this is a self-post, I receive no karma.

**Remember to have your Steam profile in your flair, or in your post!**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The drawing of the numbers will take place when the post is approx. 1 day old! **Keep an eye out for the results!**

There will be **FOUR** winners for this, one for each item!

Numbers will be drawn via [RANDOM.ORG](http://www.random.org/)

Also, if you don't know, and probably 1% of you do, JinX is having a group exclusive raffle! Come down and join the group, read the instructions and you could win a **BIG SHINY KEY!** [Announcement HERE!](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JinX_Clan#announcements/detail/1317563420536832763)

If you have any questions, add either myself or [DrHaxx](http://steamcommunity.com/id/drhaxx). Keep in mind that we live on polar opposites of the world so one will usually be online while the other is not.

**ONE FINAL NOTE:** We don't really like saying this, but we do accept donations! Please, if you have any unwanted items that you would like to donate for future raffles, contact, as stated, Myself or [DrHaxx](http://steamcommunity.com/id/drhaxx)!

Found some strange stuff lying around.  

* Team Spirit Bills Hat - 9 keys

Old Bill was a war hero. Ain't much left to remember him by. Guess the calamity didn't care much for bravery.

**SOLD**


* ~~Fancy Dress Uniform - 1 key, 1 ref, 1 rec~~

Fancy tie belonged to a general. Kinda thing that would make a man straighten up with pride. No shame in looking good.

* ~~Salvaged Crate #40 - 12 keys~~

Kid found box marked valuable, just lying in the road. Kid don't stop to wonder why. Salvaged it and brought it back to the bastion. Opening it is probably best left to the professionals.

* ~~Buccaneer's Biccorne - 2 ref (x2)~~

Kid's never been one for the ocean. With a feather that fine, must have belonged to a rich man. Guess he made his money the easy way instead of the right way. 

* ~~Cremator's Conscience - 2 ref~~

Pair of dolls come as a set. One an angel, the other devil. After seeing the calamity, not so sure there's a difference.

* ~~Bonedolier - 2 ref, 1 rec~~

Kid find's an old momento from a man who thought he was a shaman. Didn't do him much good when the calamity came. 

* ~~Crone's Dome - 2 keys, 1 rec~~

Never seen a hat smile before. 

* ~~Vintage Tyrolean - 1 ref, 2 rec~~

A fine old hat with a feather in its brim. Kid don't like it too much but he's never been much of a healer. Probably a good thing not to get attached to what you're selling.

* ~~Strange Mantreads - 4 keys~~

Some boots for an old soldier. Heavy enough to trample someone. Still got a bit of that polished shine. Bit o' work and they'll be just like new. 

* ~~Strange Widowmaker - 7 keys~~

Strange gun takes any sort of metal for ammo. Heaven for a tinkerer with spare parts. Kid ain't got much patience with machines. Probably better off in someone else's hands anyway.

Go check it out here: http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/10orw4/psa_tf2outpost_toolbox_script_12_released/

------------------------------------------

[UPDATE] 1.1

First new version since I released this. It's just got a few fixes as requested:

 - Lower browser resolutions are now fixed
 - The notes show up everywhere that they should!

I'll be adding the new features into a bigger release later on.

You can download the new version from: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/148791

If you had a problem with the 'my trades' or 'trade' page, update again. Did a quick fix! :P

----------------------------------------------------------

Hi guys,

So this is a follow on from this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/10b946/q_what_greasemonkey_scripts_do_you_use_to_make/

A fair amount of interest was shown in the script, so I went about making it more user friendly and a bit more robust. I also took out some stuff that would probably cause TF2Outpost to slow the shit down.

So without further ado, you can now find the script on userscripts.org:

http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/148791

The text from userscripts.org:

This is an all in 1 script for TF2Outpost improvements. Features include the following:

- Saved searches. Add an option to the main navigation where you can save and load searches. 
- Hide trades. You can hide trades from ever showing up again! 
- Toggle dontators. Show and hide dontators (Undecided whether this should persist across search pages) 
- Toggle by keyword. Enter a keyword and it'll filter all the trades with that keyword. (thinking of adding an option to allow the user to choose whether it's a positive or negative keyword) 
- Show the notes on the right of the trade (and hide the adverts) 
- Auto refresh when you hit a 503 page 
- (forgot about this one) if a search listing shows no trades (because you've hidden them all!) then it'll automatically move onto the next page!

Features to be implemented (ideas from you guys!)

- Highlight trades you've already put an offer on. 
- Allow the user to load all trades on one page, instead of having them paginated - i've taken this out for now as I fear if I left this in, TF2Outpost would show the dreaded 503 more often!
- Adding prices from the tf2 spreadsheet to items - like bazaar.tf. This would get the data once a week or so and store it locally on the browser.
- Adding a WYSIWYG editor for when you make a new trade.
- Toggle trades to only show trades by users that are online

If you like this script, please tell me :) You can find me at http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaicine

If you feel like donating anything, please also feel free :) If you can think of some feature you'd like and are willing to donate, more than likely I will write it for you!

Also please rate the script!

If you have any ideas for features to add to the script please let me know!

Thanks

Since my last raffle only had 6 people comment, and no one joined our group, I deleted it, and am starting a new one. 

Once again, this is to promote our new Buy-In Raffle group, in which there will be raffles everyday, and how expensive the raffle prize is decided upon how large the community is.

The buy-ins are only 1 scrap, so yea, it's pretty cheap.

Now for the raffle on here.

1) UPVOTE the thread for visibility (I don't get karma from this)

2) Post a number below between 1-200 in ""000"" format

3) Wait until I decide a winner (via Random.org) at midnight

Please, join our group, and support us, it would be appreciated :D

And invite all of your friends!!

Edit 2:Going back in for round 2 in the servers....hmm vanilla or not.....

Edit: It looks like the trade severs are down for a bit. I have already given out a few items and i will be back in a few to check and see if things are up and going again for more free items. PS.... feel free to leave the comments asking for a specific item in the comments below. However you must acompany it with the funniest joke you know. I will then select my favorite and give them the item they requested. i will choose this one at 10pm tonight. CST Thanks!!!



I recently collected 100 crates and keys to do a live unboxing on the tf2trade servers for fun. A couple of days laker, I awoken to all 100 crates being opened and me having a groggly recolection of saying fuck it and opeing them in a random server the night prior while doing one of my oh so favorite ""drunken tf2 nights"". Well needless to say I am dissapointed in myself over this. I had promised some of the crate sellers I would unbox live as most people like to watch those. So to make up for it and to show a little love for the community I am going to be giving away nearly all the contents of the crates I unboxed that night for FREE!!! (I have take some select items out to help fund key purchases for more of these uncratings later.) I would also like to say I have the following 2 unuals up for trade to help fund those as well if any has offers


**Unusual Hats**
* Unusual Armored Authority (Purple Confetti)
* Unusual Handyman's Handle (Circling TF Logo)

**Ok so on the the good part. FREE SH*T!!!!**

Below you will find a list of most the of contents of my bp. I will in some cases choose the item, others i will let them chose from a group, or maybe even from the whole BP. I will do this on one of the 2 tf2trade servers at random times over the next 2 days, or in the tf2trade group chat when im stuck at work (hint 8-5cst tomorrow). My name on there will be as always, Kevin Spacey.  I would appreicate getting this on up towards the top so everyone has a chance to join in for the fun. I may just invite someone to trade and give them items, or i may have people in the server perform tasks (first to kill me, find me, backstab me, etc...), hell i could even throw in some triva. Who knows!?!?!!? During the day tomorrow I will be at work, so I will probably join up on the tf2trade group chat to give some stuff away.

Got into trading a few days ago. It was a lot of fun. But I've been having arguments at home and finally decided to fuckall.

Trading away everything I have for free.

How this will work is, for any regular weapon, just call dibs and its yours. Post a number from 1 to 300 for entering the raffle for the hats. Also, I'll give away the stranges to random people who post funny jokes here for people when they are looking at what is not taken yet.

PS - I'm grounded right now and can only do so much from my phone. Be a little patient. I'll trade as soon as I come online.

I'll need a giftwrap to send the marauder.

If anybody feels like donating a weapon to add here, or crates or even keys, you're welcome to do so. I'll uncrate and raffle whatever I get, if I get any keys. Forgive me if greed overpowers me in case I uncrate an unusual. Other than that, enjoy!!

_____________

**Rules and Introduction**

It's me, back again! I've decided how I'm going to do this now:

Every 2 weeks or so I will post a flair request thread. I'll start taking requests for 24 hours. Then I'll brew some tea and toast some crumpets and I'll go on a massive flair spree for an hour or two, making my way through till all requests are done. 

Also because I'm making this a semi-regular thing now I wanna make some rules (not scary rules).

+ **You must only ask for a flair if you have the intention of donating, or have previously donated.**
+ Please check the hat has not already been made by going to the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/121jz7/introducing_donator_flair/)
+ Please give me any info I might need; *Style, Paint, Unusual effect*
+ 1 request per person, feel free to come back next fortnight if you feel like switching things up a bit.
+ No down voting others. All requests will be seen and fulfilled.
+ I aim to please, but if you're unhappy with the quality of a flair, please politely ask. 

If you don't have [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) I highly suggest you get it. It gives you a little hand button to show [what the flairs will look like](http://i.imgur.com/hMdvj.png). 

If you don't have it yet, I strongly recommend [Flair Linker Enhanced](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wvmk8/psa_flair_linker_enhanced_is_now_available/) 
______________________________________

**What this is all about?** 

If you've been around in the last few weeks or so, you will know about the new hat flair that you get when donating to the server. 

To find out more go [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/121jz7/introducing_donator_flair/)

I think it's a brilliant idea, so I wanted to add to the hats being made flairs. 

So here's the plan. You make a request below then I will try to make it for you. I'm fairly new to this, so go easy on me. I will try to do as many as possible. 

All I want in return is for you to donate to the server. That's it!

I will add to the current weeks list with ones to be made. They will either be in progress or queued up to be made.

The specific URL in this case was meant to appear to be a *.jpg on imgur.  The actual URL being `http://imgur.&lt;snip&gt;.com/analcookie.jpg`.  (Domain removed for security)

The simplest solution to avoid the exploit currently is to uninstall Java 7.  The exploit doesn't work on older versions of Java so if you have Java 6 or older only you are safe from this specific exploit (others may exist so you may want to look into if you need Java, and if your browsers need to have the Java plugin enabled).  A few other methods to work around the Java 7 exploit can be found in this article here: http://features.techworld.com/security/3378335/six-ways-protect-against-new-actively-exploited-java-vulnerability/.

Everyone should always be careful when clicking any links on Steam but until this Java bug is fixed make sure you are extra careful!

I am writing this for two reasons: (1) to clarify changes that have occurred, and (2) to set out objectives for the growth of this community.

***

**The Trading Subreddit**

Currently, the subreddit has almost 8,000 people. We currently receive  over 1.5 million page views a month. This month, out of the roughly 1.5 million page views, 93,503 of those visitors are unique - meaning people who do not just bash F5. 

Since our subreddit has grown so much, a concern has been a flood of the PSA announcements that do not pertain to community concern. As a result, we have [implemented rules](http://redd.it/j8po5) as to what qualifies as a PSA. Please take a moment to review them before you post a PSA.

Another thing that we will be implementing shortly to help those unfamiliar with reddit is altering the ""hot"", ""new"", and ""top"" tabs. Each tab will have a bit more of an explanatory phrase to help those new here navigate. This will not interrupt the way that those of you that are used to using the subreddit use the subreddit. 

I'd also like to update everyone on AutoModerator. Our initial reason for bringing in the Automoderator was to take things out of the spam queue quicker. I am proud to report that AutoModerator is actively working better than expected and approves over 100 posts a day, placing the trades into the new queue. 

***

**The Chat Room**

Recently rules were rolled out and enforced in the chat room. The enforcement of those rules drove the regular users away from the chat room. The rules, in short, provided for no ethnic/racial/homophobic slurs, being respectful, and a limitation on trolling other members. 

After reviewing these rules, I fail to see any problem with them. However, the issue, in this case, occurred once they were enforced. As soon as the rules were posted the moderation team took swift action in enforcing them and several chat bans were issued. Going forward, all moderators will be enforcing the *spirit* of the rules and not the letter. This means you can say anything you want to your friend, except for racial/homophobic/ethnic/etc slurs and not worry about being banned. However, you may not troll, harass, insult, etc, new members/joiners of the chat. Our community was *founded* on being noob friendly and we will continue to be noob friendly.


 I reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding the chat bans and, effectively immediately will be lifting *some* of the chat bans. The others, however, will stay for a period ending one week from their time of the ban.

In determining which will be unbanned immediately, I took into account a number of factors. However, the heaviest factor I took into consideration was the actions that the person took *after* they were banned. Therefore, for those that continued harassing or condescending comments toward the moderator staff or disrupted the chat room *after* their banning will not be immediately unbanned. However, once the ban period ends, everyone will start with a clean slate.

As an aside, moderators are volunteers. Belittling, harassing, or insulting moderators or administrators in our community will not be tolerated what so ever. If it ever comes down to permitting a person or group of people to belittle, harass, or insult a moderator for the sake of having a chat room, I rather not have a chat room. No person deserves to be belittled, harassed, or insulted for the sake of their *voluntary* job in an *internet* community.

That aside, chat bans will not be time capped. The first ban will be for one week. A second ban will be for one month. A third ban is a perma ban. Permanent bans shall be issued for any sort of scamming activity **including** marked scammers. No exceptions.

Chat bans will be appealable **directly** to me. I will have the final word whether or a not a chat ban was justified. Moderators are required to screen shot/log each ban and the reason for the ban. Failure of a moderator to do that will result in an immediate unban - regardless of reason except for marked scammers.

***

**Trade Servers**

As some of you know, our unusual server has been taken down. We still, however, have two very active trader servers. Please feel free to donate and receive donor perks. If you donate, be sure to include your Steam ID so you may receive those perks on our server. You may donate via paypal or with keys.

Overall, our community continues to grow. In fact, I am currently working on a consolidation of resources across all reddit trading communities including shared reputation. As our community continues to grow, so will our staff. Therefore you may see a few more friendly faces about willing to help.

You go to [TF2Toolbox](http://tf2toolbox.com/bbcode_lookup.php), type in your Steam ID in the top right, select the checkboxes for the pages you want, and the app will generate some BBCode of all the items in those pages.

1366408819.0,51,self.tf2trade,1cpbkm,[PSA] The Max's Severed Head and its Value Versus Stats,58,7,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1cpbkm/psa_the_maxs_severed_head_and_its_value_versus/,"So we all know that the level 1 and 7 Max's Severed Heads are all duped and sell for much less, right?

Wrong. 


First of all, [here's the stats page. ](http://stats.tf/item/162/Max%27s_Severed_Head)
Scroll through the level list and look at the level 7 Max. Only 78 exist. That's less than many, many other levels.

Now you're probably wondering, why is it so low if level 7 Max Heads are all duped?

Answer: They're not. 

The level 1 and 7 thing was a rumor started by traders that all Max Heads of the aforementioned levels were duped, simply because the majority of Max Heads on Outpost etc. were level 1 and several were level 7 during the Steam Beta, in which the duping glitch took place. This led traders to believe that *all* level 1 and 7 Heads were duped, thus beginning the Max Head stigma.

One of the biggest reasons there are so many level 1 Max Heads is not that they were duped. It's that a little over halfway through the promotion, Valve decided that not all promo hats should be the same level and instead randomized the levels. The promotion only lasted a single week, so people bought the game in a hurry to secure their promos. Those that bought the game early received level 1 heads. However, the promotion was, without notice, extended by a week, so those who bought the game after the initial promotion still could receive a Max Head, which had a 1/100 chance of being level 1. There are currently a little over 8000 non-level 1 Unique Max Heads and slightly under 1500 level 1 Unique Max Heads. That gives a nice idea of the time span of the event and when the level 1s were turned into level x's.

Now, we come to the ID wipe. A little while after the duping exploit was patched, Valve decided do renew the histories of all of the Max Heads that were duped from the glitch. This gave them new IDs but left the original IDs the same, letting people track the dupes. [Here is an example](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/10051878) of a non-duped level 1 Max. [Here](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/10039875) is an example of somebody being confused about whether their hat is a dupe or not (it's not). [Here](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/7211122) is a duped one. A hat with an identical original ID (1189008198) resides [here](http://www.tf2outpost.com/backpack/13288). [Here](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/9275833) is a Max head with a one-owner history, because of the history wipe. You can also see ""❤skaPANeas❤"" claiming it to be duped.

Last but not least, if the duping of level 7s is all but a myth, and the level 1 somewhat less so? While it is true that there are many duped Max Heads (~8/94 on Outpost as of this posting), the level 1 and 7 Max's are devalued simply because people believe them to be worth less. Buyers dictate the market, because they are the ones that give the final say in what is paid for an item. These buyers all believe that level 1 and 7 Max's are not worth 2 buds, and will not pay that. This creates an impasse between firm 2-bud sellers and under-2-bud buyers, which the buyers will win. Thus, the level 1 and 7 Maxes are brought down in price, and the repetition of this action by many traders drives the stigma further. The entire reason the level 1 and 7 Max's are worth less is simply because of the value people believe it to be worth, like any item. 

That's about it. I may tack stuff on later, but I'm submitting this so I don't lose the form &gt;_&gt;

Back in September I went absolutely crazy and **bought 500 keys** just so I could **open 500 crates** and **livestream the whole thing**. Then, I **gave away the majority of the items** I procured by raffling them off. Individually.

This was an incredibly stupid idea, perhaps even more so than spending almost a thousand dollars on keys. Doing ~500 trades is not fun. In the end, I got the majority of them done, but was rather put off the idea of having to deal with that again.

Shortly afterwards, I thought of a better idea - **give away one of each strange I unbox, and most hats and special items**, but turn the rest into metal. Then, using that metal, **craft hats and give them away** instead! Still a lot of work, but much less so than before. Plus, people get hats instead of largely worthless strange weapons. Win-win! And if they feel it's added value (a piece of history or something) they can even leave the 'crafted by aryst0krat' tag on them.

Also, something I did last time was pledge to **raffle off the 5th unusual** if I get 5 or more (going by straight percentages, this is how many I should get from 500 crates). This will be carrying over! Last time I only got two, but I raffled one off anyway because I didn't particularly want it. There is a very good chance this will happen again, but I won't make any promises other than that 1 of 5 will be given away for sure.

One other thing I did (poorly) was **donate to Childsplay** for every 100 viewers that were in the stream. I peaked around 300, a $75 donation at $25 per 100 viewers, but I upped it to $125 because I forgot to make the donation at first and felt bad. No one actually called me out on it, surprisingly! I guess more people were interested in the crates! :P

Unfortunately, I thought of this idea too late to actually get sanctioned as an event by Childsplay, but this time I hope to be able to do so, and depending on my finances I will probably either up the donation or the milestones at which I donate. I would love it if you could donate, too. :)

###So, when is this going to happen?###

Well, there are a few roadblocks here. The first one being that I am **totally out of crates.**

Last time, I asked for some help with this problem and was absolutely *floored* by the response. I could easily have received 1000 crates as donations if I'd had the room or desire. Unfortunately, but expectedly, a lot of these crates were fairly worthless. Not that their actual worth bothers me, but for the people receiving the items it would be nice to get something useful/expensive.

So I'm going to ask for your generosity in this field again, if you don't mind, but this time I'll try to be a little more discerning about the **quality of the crates**. That said, if you have some to give away, I'm going to post a comment that you can reply to so that the thread at large isn't clogged up. From there I'll decide which ones I'll take and open.

If I don't get any/enough donations (which, given last time, is unlikely but still a possibility) I will still do the unboxing, I'll just have to get crates the slow, expensive way. Not really a big deal.

The second roadblock is **keys**. No, I'm not asking for help on this one. I won't necessarily *turn it down*, but when you're buying 500 keys, a gift of one is sort of like trying to raise the sea level with an eyedropper. Besides, the whole point of this is that I'm crazy and I spend way too much money on nonsense.

No, the real issue here is just time; I have *no* idea how long it will take me to make room in my budget for the keys, or how long it will take me to find a good seller. If I find a good seller and have the money, it could be as soon as two weeks from now that I'm ready to go, key-wise. Or, it could be a few months.

So if you know **anyone who is selling keys for a good price in bulk** (preferably I'd buy them all at once, but hey), let me know! A good price is anything $1.35 USD and below, as far as I am concerned. I bought most of mine at $1.25 last time, but unfortunately that seller was cashing out and I don't think he even plays TF2 anymore. Bulk means... well, unless the price is ridiculously good I can't imagine buying less than 50 at once. I'd appreciate if I could get a bulk discount or something, but I understand that this is asking a lot of the seller. :)

**Canadian sellers are preferred, as I am Canadian and if I could avoid Paypal's conversion fees that would be wonderful.**

The other roadblock is **my internet connection**. I work 10 of every 14 days, and during this time I am unable to sign into Steam, except for the actual website. My work camp is absolutely bonkers about their internet filters. So unless someone knows a way to get around WatchGuard Technologies' filters (which seem really damn robust), **I am only able to trade/chat for very small periods of time** (I have to see my friends and family while I'm at home, too!).

All that said, I'm going to try to do this **some time in the spring or early summer.** It will be on a weekend, maybe a Friday evening or Saturday, and will probably go for about... 4 hours, I think? I can't remember exactly how long the last one was.

###Any questions?###

And then this week, not only do I get a hat drop, not only do I get *two* hat drops, but I get... *four* hat drops!? And one of them is a [Team Captain](http://tf2b.com/tf2/item/izzalion/1198991320)?!

Well. Gosh.

So, since I still have more keys and metal than I know what to do with, I've decided I might as well just *throw this darned hat in the trash*-er, I mean, give it away to some nice redditor.

So here we are... raffle time!

**HOW 2 ENTER**

I'd like to make this a little bit fun, so! In order to enter, you must comment below with a link to your steam profile **and** a link to a spooky tf2 Halloween screenshot taken by you! It can be from in-game, SFM, even hand drawn on a napkin, as long as it's tf2 and Halloween related you will be considered eligibly entered.

**WHO WINS**

Even though I'm asking for screenshots for entry, the winner(s) will still be determined randomly - so don't worry about competing with any masters of SFM or, heaven forbid, napkin artistry wizards! And did I say winner(s)? Because I meant **winners**, as in *multiple tiers of winnitude*.

Winners will be chosen **Thursday** at around **sometime in the afternoon where I live (which is GMT-5)**.

**WHAT WE WIN**

Raffle prizes are as follows!

* **1st** - 1x Team Captain, 1x Eerie Key, 1x Regular Key
* **2nd** - 1x Genuine King of Scotland Cape (Spooky, right?), 1x Regular Key
* **3rd** - 1x Cream Spirit Paint

### Questions
## Why can't I just use my Steam ID?
Reddit does allow links in Flair. Since Steam IDs can easily be changed, and your link will stop working if you change it, using your Steam Profile Number will ensure that the link to your Profile continues working should you change your ID. The bot will validate the URL you submit. If you didn't follow the instructions above to get the link, your Flair will be rejected.

## Okay, but clickable links really would be a lot easier...
Well, I have even more good news! Redditor [zedadex](http://www.reddit.com/user/zedadex) has [written a script](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/kaucc/tf2trade_flair_linker/) that will make all the Flair links in this subreddit fully clickable. It's compatible with Chrome and Firefox with the [Greasemonkey extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

## My Flair is still not appearing!

I was trying to sell my Unusual Ze Goggles with Orbit Fire when I got added by someone. They asked me if they would be able to record me playing TF2 for some videos on their YouTube. I said alright and he said to use TeamViewer so he could see me playing. Then he tells me that he wants to pay me before doing the shoot for helping him out. Then he wants me to put up my unusual so the people on YouTube can see it. He then uses TeamViewer to accept the trade for both me and him and then trades the unusual over to him. After looking around, I also found that he did the same thing to someone for 4 buds and 2 bills and to someone else for a Max's. [Here](http://www.tf2outpost.com/backpack/28525) is his Steam ID just to have everyone know. And also for people to be aware of this new scam that I never heard of before.

The following rules may change with or without notice.*

***

**GENERAL POSTING/TRADE RULES**

1.  **Conduct.** Offensive, rude, or inappropriate posts or comments will be removed and/or the user is subject to a ban from both /r/TF2Trade, the chatroom, and the in-game trade server.

2. **Negative Comments. DO NOT** trash talk, put down, ""crap on"" or insult other people's trades, posts, or comments. If it is a bad deal, ignore it. You will be banned for one week if you violate this rule. It will be **your responsibility** to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftf2trade) and request an unbanning after your week ban has expired.

2. **Money Trading.** Money trading is done at your own risk. /r/tf2trade, its moderators, administrators, and/or anyone else with a position of authority within the /r/tf2trade community, actual or apparent, does not warrant, represent, or otherwise guarantee the safety of cash trades. **You are responsible for your own trades.** [If you are new to cash trading, read this](http://redd.it/luc4d). It is **highly suggested** that you use reputable middle men. Only TF2 items may be traded for cash. No game, code, or sales of other kinds are permitted.

3. **Game Trading.** Trading games for items and vice versa is permitted, so long as TF2 items are involved and the game can be traded via Steam Trade. If you want to trade game for game, try [/r/SteamGameSwap](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamgameswap). 


4. **The [H] Tag.** You must post exactly what you are trading in the post title unless it is over 5 items. If your have over 5 items, you do not need to post everything for sale. If your items are **not** posted in the title of the post because it goes over 5 items, the items you are trading must be posted within the thread itself. Simply linking only to the backpack is insufficient. 
&gt; This means do not just post: ""[H] Backpack"" if under 5 items. Without your items listed in the title, people cannot search for your post. However, if you have over 5 items for trade, ""[H] Backpack"" would be sufficient


6. **The [W] Tag.** Your post must list at least something you will consider for a trade, either in your title or in your description.
&gt; For instance, ""[H] Stout Shako [W] Offers"" is unacceptable. However, [H] Stout Shako [W] 2 refined or offers"" is acceptable. If you don't know what you want, no one else knows what you want. Statistically speaking you are more likely to trade your item if you state what you want.
&gt; This also means **NO AUCTIONS**

7. **Stores/Shops.** [Special ""Store"" and ""Shop"" Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/irely/rules_regarding_stores_or_shops/)

8. **Raffles.** Raffles with buy-ins are not permitted. ""Free"" raffles or give away raffles where the holder of the raffle receives **nothing** in return is permitted

9. **Game Codes/Item Codes.** The trading of game codes or item codes is strictly prohibited. The general rule is if it does not fit into the Steam Trade window, you cannot trade it here. The exception to this rule is cash trading discussed above.

10. **Prices.** You must set prices for each and every item that you are buying or selling.

11. **Reposts.** You may post (or repost) one trade every 12 hours.

12. **PSAs.** PSAs may only be posted if they meet the following three criteria: (1) the PSA is not personal in nature (ex: no posting about bans in other communities), (2) the announcement is directly related to the trading community, and (3) the PSA will benefit the members of the trading community. Advertisements and other posts that do not meet these criteria may be allowed with prior approval from the moderators.

13. **Tags, Generally.** Every post must contain a tag. Tags are required as we utilize an AutoModerator to both approve and remove posts. When posting you must type in your post title as follows ""[Tag] text here"". Appropriate tags are below:

&gt; * [PSA]  

&gt; * [Store] - Stores may use the Store tag as opposed to [H] and [W], but you must classify first as a [store](http://redd.it/irely).

&gt; * [Raffle] - Raffles

&gt; * [Contest] - Contests

&gt; * [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item

&gt; * [Free], [Giveaway] -Free items or giveaways

&gt; * [Q] - For Questions

&gt; * [H] items here [W] items here - General trading





**NOTES**

* It is *highly* suggested that you demo your screen when conducting these trades. 

* It is *highly* suggested to not purchase games for a trade, only trade what you have. Meaning if someone says ""I want $15 worth of Steam Games"" and you go out and buy it instead of trading what you already have.  If the other guy backs out of a trade after you spend a ton of money on games - **there is absolutely nothing that the moderators or game admins can do**. The simple solution is **DO NOT TAKE THE RISK!** 

* Watch the ""Item"" text box to ensure what has been put in the box is what you think has been put in the box.

**Remember:** Best trade practices do apply. Always research the other guy, prices, etc. Once the trade is done, it is done",,False,,t5_2s0s4,1346116450.0,,trusted hat,True,t3_j8po5,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/j8po5/official_rtf2trade_trading_rules/,moderator

--------

That is eight events total! Please note the days that these events will take place.

------
------

The availability for these events will most likely be 30 slots for players per server, since two will be taken by admins/mods to help run the event. That is a total of 60 slots open on BOTH servers. Like I said earlier, this would probably be a multi-day event. And it will be! I've marked the days that these events will go by, so be sure to look at that! 

To gain entrance into the server, you will need a password which will be provided via the posts for that day. Inbetween events, we **will** be removing everyone from the server and putting a different password on. There's going to be about 5 minutes inbetween the events, and they may run for awhile, so we'll have to see how long. The new password, will be put on the same post the original password came from.

Quick note as well: **If you are playing in these events, intentionally messing with other players, not following typical server rules, etc. will be under the discretion of the admins/mods who are supervising.** So listen to them. Don't argue. If there's a bad enough problem, report it to the mods here on the subreddit, with proof please.

-----

Can't wait to see y'all there! Friday will probably be hosted closer to midnight (I believe I am working next Friday, I don't know the rest of my schedule though). I will make a post about it when I get on my break, but won't release the password until we're ready to go.

1348961117.0,51,self.tf2trade,10orw4,[PSA] TF2Outpost Toolbox script 1.2 released!,58,7,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/10orw4/psa_tf2outpost_toolbox_script_12_released/,"Hi everyone,

As you may or may not have seen, last week I released the first version of a greasemonkey/tampermonkey script to help improve trading on TF2Outpost.com. The response I got back has been amazing. As of now, the script is being used by over 600 people.

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, this is what the script did in the first version, before this update:

 - Saved searches. Adds an option to the main navigation where you can save and load searches!
 - Hide trades. You can hide trades from ever showing up again!
 - Toggle dontators. Show and hide dontators
 - Toggle by keyword. Enter a keyword and it'll filter all the trades with that keyword.
 - Show the notes on the right of the trade list (and hide the adverts)
 - Auto refresh when you hit a 503 page
 - If a search listing shows no trades (because you've hidden them all!) then it'll automatically move onto the next page

Since I released the script last week, I've been gathering feedback and finding out what people like about the script, and what people want.

Today I'm happy to release the first big update to the script. The following features have been added:

 - Lots of UI Improvements
 - The toggle to hide all donators will now persist across pages (so now you only click it once)
 - I've changed how quickly the script refreshes the page when TF2Outpost returns a 503 error. Now it's once every 3 seconds.
 - Added a button to delete individual saved searches
 - The script will now check for a new version when you first open the TF2Outpost website
 - Added negative and positive keyword toggles (so you can now show by keyword as well as hide by keyword)
 - Added toggle by item level
 - Added toggle by craft number
 - Added toggle by unusual effect
 - Added a button to show/hide more info on the trade listings page
 - Added a 'toolbox' menu item which will include settings and things like that
 - Show how many trades have been hidden in the toolbox menu
 - Added a 'clear all hidden trades' button to the toolbox menu (careful with this one!)
 - Added a 'clear last 10 hidden trades' button to toolbox menu
 - Added a 'clear first 10 hidden trades' button to toolbox menu
 - Added a block user button to trades page
 - If the toggle doesn't match any trades, automatically go to the next page
 - Fixed a bug with cancelling on the keyword toggle

With this script, TF2Outpost now looks a bit like this:

http://i.imgur.com/81mTW.png

There is one new feature that needs a bit more explaining - 'The script will now check for a new version when you first open the TF2Outpost website'. This works by checking a server run by me to see what the current version of the script is, and check that against your script version. Some people will argue 'why don't you just add a @downloadURL or a @updateURL?' two reasons for this. I don't like the greasemonkey implementation of this (slow), and chrome doesn't support this! Most people using this script use chrome, so I don't want to alienate those people.

After the first release of the script, quite a lot of people added me on steam to say thank you and some kind people even gave me tf2 items as a way of thanks. These are the people that drove me to add more features to the script and continue improving it.

With all that in mind, I've decided the auto update functionality will work on a 'donators' version of the script. Everything else is exactly the same, and you'll get all the same features as everyone else.

If you like the sound of the update notification version and you think this script is worth donating to, you can add me on steam and i'll give you a toolbox unlock key: http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaicine :)

If you want the regular version, you can download that here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/148791

Also, this is the last [PSA] post I am going to do. So either get the update notification version, or keep an eye on the userscript page or the script homepage.

To use this script on firefox:
 1. Install greasemonkey: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
 2. Go to the script page: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/148791

(To keep firing the launcher press mouse1 like normal, otherwise bugs may occur. If you run into issues using this script, like the grenade launcher firing instead of you charging, change classes in spawn and then change back to demoman.)

* There was a bunch of promo codes leaked for Dirt 3 that will likely be blacklisted at some point and could possibly get your steam account banned if you add it. 

* I've heard of people trading leaked Dirt 3 Keys for tf2 items, and had someone ask myself if I wanted to buy one. 

* I am not sure that someone can add one of these codes as a gift or are just telling people the key, however you should definitely not buy one from someone with just a key outside of steam as it's likely one of these codes, especially if the offer is too good to be true.

The clean ones are worth nothing, do not be scammed by people trying to take advantage of you.",53,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/164rlf/psa_all_grordborts_crests_are_now_clean_dirty/,"The Jan ~~~4th~~~ [2nd (US timezones) / 3rd (GMT)](http://git.optf2.com/schema-tracking/commit/?id=20f89c117c7f251094ebe33e06e66bd71f6963a4) update made all grordbort's badges (the ones from the Victory Pack) craftable, and auto-converted existing ones from dirty to clean. ~~~The supply of clean jumped from 200 -&gt; 8000 and counting.~~ (completely wrong)

They are not worth 16 keys. Selling 16 keys @ 1.25 would give you enough to buy the _entire victory pack_. Buying the crest for 16 keys _is an even worse deal than the Mann Co store_.

Do not be scammed by a seller who is banking on you not knowing about that schema change.

EDIT: As pointed out below, some people still have uncraftables. I'm not entirely sure what the conditions are for this happening.

EDIT2: I now see the schema has a new attribute called 'can_craft_if_purchased'. So I would guess that it uses the last 'state' of the item (purchased, gifted, dropped, etc) to determine whether it's craftable, and as such, ones marked 'traded' would not be converted.  It also seems possible that trading this 'clean' item to someone might cause it to turn dirty when it enters their backpack?

EDIT3: The 'origin' flag on the crest is not what impacts the dirty-to-clean toggle, as there are instances of crests with 'purchased' for the origin (yet have still been traded), and those traded ones are not craftable. What seems to be consistent is that those who traded for them retain uncraftable crests, and those who purchase them end up with clean crests.

EDIT4: I traded my clean crest to a friend, and it remained craftable for him, despite him never purchasing the victory pack, so it is not tied to the purchase history of the current owner. When I viewed the badge on backpack.tf, my 'original id' matches the current id, even after the trade, which _may_ be the reason it's clean? Checking the crests of those who have uncraftables shows that the original id no longer matches the current item id.

Once you request a picture, I'll ask you a few questions over Steam chat about the details of your render, create it within a few days (depending on my schedule) and then send you the picture!

Leave a comment with your Steam information and a request, or just go ahead and add me! If you do leave a comment here, tell me if I should use my judgement and create the render as I see fit (doing this will allow me to finish the render very quickly), or if you have any specific ideas in mind we can discuss them before I create the render.

------------------------------------------------------------

###PSA and Raffle #4 - The tournament competitors have been announced!

------------------------------------------------------------

For those who missed the announcement yesterday, here it is again! Plus another raffle, with slightly better prizes! As **it is Thursday** today, I am also announcing the competitors in this tournament - congratulations for all who got in, and for those who didn't, don't worry! Feel free to come by and watch on Saturday! I will be enabling SourceTV on my server, so feel free to come and spectate, everybody.

You may know me from [an announcement I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ws4ye/psa_come_join_the_community_trade_server_where/) last week about setting up a new trade server, focusing on trading with a sense of community.

It hasn't been that popular, but it has gotten a fair amount of people occasionally. So I got to thinking, ""how can I help make my trade server more popular, and have more people join, and hopefully come back regularly?"" 

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, I decided to organize an event, hosted on my trade server, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His partner?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday, 12 PM PST**, I will be hosting an epic battle on my server! I call it: ""The Huntsman and the Spy"". 

---------------------------------

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers, and 7 spies.

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map, but spies are allowed.

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!), and the goal of each sniper will be to use their Huntsman to take out enemy snipers on the other side of the map. Your spy partner can either hang around you to protect you from enemy spies, or they can choose to sneak their way across the map and backstab enemy snipers. 

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats, until there are 3 semi-finalist teams on Red and Blu. 

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, the last team standing on Red or Blu will move to the final round. In the second round, the semi-finalists must keep battling until there is a winner on the team that did not win the first time (e.g. If a team on Blu won the first time, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round, the two teams must go head to head with each other. Sniper vs sniper, with both spies trying to protect their sniper and take out the other sniper and spy. The first sniper to die will cause their team to lose.

And that's it for the rules!

-------------------------------------------------

###THE GRAND PRIZES ARE: For the champion Sniper, he receives a Team Spirit painted Genuine Anger and a strange Sniper Rifle! For his faithful parter, a non-genuine Dashin' Hashshashin and a non-genuine Sharp Dresser!

As stated before, there will also be prizes each round for the teams that come out on top. **Redditors, if you are interested in donating a few items, be they weapons, miscs or hats, please do so! They will go into the prize pool! Also, as a for-profit trader, it'll make me feel better after giving away so many prizes... haha.**

Plus: The Crafting Sytem - The Hero We Need, or the Hero we Deserve?",51,2,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/nguy9/discussion_state_of_the_mannconomy_metal_for_keys/,"This was originally going to be a quick response to [I_Hate_Reddit's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ngo66/with_the_steam_sale_coming_up_what_is_the_current/c38yotq), but it got out of hand. Any discussion on this topic is encouraged, thanks!

--------------------------------

""No matter how many keys people buy from the store, there will be too many people willing to pay whatever to get them for metal, and sell them for cash later.""

And since this is obviously detrimental to Valve since idlers basically buy keys for free (weekly drops) and sell for money (one less sale at the Mann Co store), it begs the question of how can this be fixed?

**EDIT:** _Re-reading my post, the biggest hole I see in my argument is this: Even if someone sells a key in the black market for $1 and the price of keys in metal goes up to 5 ref, at some point someone had to pay the Mann co store $2.50 for that key. However, I still think metal inflation is a concern, and is ultimately detrimental to the mannconomy and tf2. First, it creates a barrier to entry that may deter people from entering the market and second, it gives those hoarding goods more power to influence the market._ **/EDIT**

**Supply &amp; Demand**

_Demand_

Right now Valve is approaching the problem by making keys indispensable. Do you want a festive/strange/unusual? No matter how much metal you have, someone somewhere has to have had purchased a key from the store in order to open a crate and create that festive/strange/unusual. This obviously works, but I feel it is only a short-term solution. Someone in another thread pointed out the absurdity of the ""Strange Festive Weapon"" -- how many adjectives can they tack onto an item before it becomes too ridiculous even for tf2? So then, how does Valve deal with the surplus of metal and subsequent devaluation of keys?

_Supply_

One approach is to attack the supply right at the root of things: crack down on idling and persons with multiple accounts. Hopefully Valve doesn't take this route because, as DRM, the War on Drugs and countless other examples have demonstrated, it doesn't work and usually does more harm than good.

_Supply, from a different perspective_

Another approach is to target the the supply once it's in the system. Right now, what do you primarily use your metal for? Mostly to buy other things -- keys for uncrating or selling, hats for personal use or crafting, or games through steam -- right? And none of those things affect the supply of metal (metal is not removed from the mannconomy, but only switches hands). So, in order to increase demand for metal, there needs to be some sort of mechanism to remove it from the economy. 

_Solutions?_

Crafting, I think is the most obvious solution. The current crafting system can be improved in two ways: first, change incentives so that recipes make mannconomical sense. Now, you can't just change the craft random headgear recipe to 2 ref - that wouldn't solve the problem, only decrease the value of the loser hats people use strictly for crafting. 

You also then, have to increase the value of possible craft results. A possible way to do this, which Valve is already doing with a few items (e.g. Last Breath), is making them only available through crafting (or purchase through the Mann Co store, of course). What if they took it a another step and made it so some items were only available if crafted with metal? What if there was a recipe to craft crates? At this point I'm just brainstorming, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.

**tl;dr** To sum things up, the wide availability of metal is detrimental to the mannconomy and, perhaps more importantly, Valve's bottom line. New updates are only a short-term solution to creating interest in buying keys from the Mann Co store, and targeting idlers/multiple accounts is not feasible. How then can the metal problem be fixed? I believe changing incentives in the crafting system to encourage the crafting of metal is the most tenable solution.

**tl;dr the conclusion** - Too much metal in tf2, tweak crafting to get rid of it.",,False,,t5_2s0s4,True,,default,True,t3_nguy9,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/nguy9/discussion_state_of_the_mannconomy_metal_for_keys/,

1373244492.0,52,self.tf2trade,1hu0b3,"[Q] Got banned from Outpost, which lead to the ban from MCT trade servers, some people treat me as scammer now. What would you do in my situation?",55,3,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1hu0b3/q_got_banned_from_outpost_which_lead_to_the_ban/,"This is gonna be a long story that I'd be grateful if you, fellow traders, put some time into. Thanks in advance.

Well, it all started in March 2012 when I got scammed out of my only unusual hat that I've been building my way to for almost half a year, which made me quit TF2 for quite long time until I unboxed a cheap unusual from Naughty crate in late December 2012.

Been trading on tf2outpost since september 2011 iirc, never broke the rules nor received a warning. After taking a long break off trading, I logged in to tf2outpost again to find myself being unable to figure out how to bump my own trades. It was stupid of me to not putting some time into checking the rules once again just to refresh my own memory and to check if any new rules were added to the list. Been successfully making trades via tf2op until late March 2013 iirc, when a guy I wanted to buy an unusual from, who was permabanned from tf2op for faking current offers on his items, asked me to help him to look for offers on one of his unusuals. Being unaware of the rules and generally dumb, I agreed to help him. Moreover, I donated 7 keys to tf2op few days ago. Which again proves the point that I would not knowingly break the rules if I knew it would lead to the permanent ban. 
http://www.tf2outpost.com/user/26592 this is my outpost profile. You can find the trade where I was ""brokering"" his hat (I never had it in my bp though) and the guy I was trying to help from the ban reason. Both of us are Russians, just his english was on the level of a 5-grader (rules are the same for everyone so lack of english skills does not save him). As soon as I got warned by guy named ""Itz just meh"", I checked the rules, found the line regarding brokering for banned users and closed trade immediately. Turned out someone already reported me since samhudson333 sent me a PM saying that I'd be banned if I didn't close the trade instantly. He told me that he understood that ""it was a matter of ignorance and was quickly corrected as soon as you read the rules"". He basically let me free. However, the next day I checked tf2op to find myself permabanned. I made an appeal on the site and samhudson333 was on my side (he was chatting with me on the ban appeal page) but later the appeal was denied by another mod. 

So, after that, I've spoken to Mr. Rager (head of bans and appeals those days) and even though it was a pleasure talking to him, he rejected all my appeals saying ""You still broke the rules"". I can't deny it was my own fault that I didn't read the rules after having a long break from trading of course. It was just quite sad to realise that I couldn't be given a second chance. Oh, and yeah, I lost 7 keys I donated of course but I couldn't care less about them.

Here's what recently happened at MCT unusual trade server. I've been trading on MCT since fall 2011 and everything was fine. A couple of months ago, I met a guy named ""CoffeenTrees"" who started making fun of me in chat when he saw that I'm asking for at least twice as much as my hat is priced on backpack.tf (my hat is a pretty expensive one, I rejected an offer of ~80 in unusuals a few days before I met this guy, which he considered fake of course). Later on, I realised that he was just envious, his backpack was way cheaper than mine and he never had an unusual worth even 4 times less than mine. You know, he was like ""hahahahaha ur so dumb, ur hat is 30 buds"" and stuff like that, his grammar and behavior were telling that he's no older than 15 basically. Then he found my profile on outpost and started spamming the chat calling me a scammer because I'm banned from tf2op. Some guys started defending me telling that ban from outpost doesn't make me a scammer yet and that it's pretty easy to get banned from there. Kid just refused to listen and calmed down. Couple of minutes later, Pink Taco (server owner) joined the server and permanently banned me with the following reason ""Scamming"" (link to sourcebans http://manncotrading.com/sourcebans/index.php?p=banlist&amp;advSearch=STEAM_0:1:19202144&amp;advType=steamid&amp;Submit). I started stalking the kid on other servers and each time he saw me on server, he started making fun of me, saying that my only account is a scammer alt etc, without providing any proof and he always disconnected when I asked him to provide proof of me scamming. I have tons of chat logs and screenshots but even they did not help me when I was appealing my ban on MCT website. I made 3 appeals asking to at least change the ban reason because I never scammed anyone. Each time I was ignored and I got all appeals denied. If you look through them on http://manncotrading.com , you'll see that mods were completely misinformed. Taco himself ignored my request to provide proof of me scamming. I tried adding him but he just kept ignoring my requests. I even added SR admin (Chaos &lt;3) trying to convince him to help me since he was both MCT and SR admin. He's been assisting me for quite some time and told me that it's pretty obvious that I was innocent and the ban on MCT was undeserved but later he just removed me without any reason. Last word from MCT admins was that I brokered an unusual for a banned user on tf2op and therefore the ban will not be lifted.

So, this is my story, I've met some people since MCT ban who were thinking of me as of scammer which really bothers me since I never scammed anyone and I wouldn't want to lose my reputation. Small mistake on tf2outpost in fact ruined my reputation across the part of tf2 trading community and my problems kept growing ever since. I would only want some advice from you because I kinda got my hopes lost. I have many screenshots, chat transcripts in case if you want more detailed info on the past events.

1372651270.0,47,self.tf2trade,1hemnm,[PSA] Sharing ways I make money,63,16,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1hemnm/psa_sharing_ways_i_make_money/,"I am working on cashing out so I figured I would share a couple of the simple ways I have learned to make money using the Steam Marketplace.  You may already know to do these, but I know many ask how to make money trading.

**Low Priced Genuine Hats:**

When genuines get to around $0.43 or less you can make a profit buying them off the market.  It takes 4.25 craft hats to make a key (5.66 ref) so that means you are spending at a maximum $1.83 per key in steam wallet.  Right now selling a key on the market gets the seller $1.93 so that is $0.10 profit for you with minimal work.  When you start building the amount of wallet you have you are able to have a large volume flowing through your pipeline bring in money to you.  Often times you will also find hats under $0.43 each thus bringing the price you pay per key lower.

**Watch genuine Prices when Updates come out:**

The last two updates that came out have made the steam market very wacky in regards to genuine prices.  I expect this to happen again with the TF2 summer update and with the summer sale.  People realize they  have genuine items from purchasing some game and want to dump them for quick money to buy robo keys, get trading cards, and in the case of the summer sale buy cheap games.  For both of these last two updates I was able to snag many genuines even below $0.20.  With these genuines you can either sell them for metal and then buy a key to sell or hold them until when the prices normalize again.

**Higher priced Genuines**

When genuines are more normal in their price you are usually able to net at least $0.61 an genuine.  I like to buy keys and then sell for metal to then buy genuines.  Fairly easily you can find genuines for 1.33 ref each and it is also pretty easy to leave a trade open on outpost buying for 1.11 or 1.22 and get a lot of people selling them to you.  With a key at 5.66 currently that means you would be getting 4.25 genuines per key.  A key costs $2.21 on the market at this time and selling 4.25 genuines for $0.61 each means you are selling a key for $2.59 each.  Some genuines sell for a little less and some sell for more, but over all when genuine prices are normalized it is very easy to make money.  The market will probably be pretty wacky until after the summer sale so this method of making money may have to wait.

**Get priority at trading websites**

I know some people don't like Outpost or scrap.tf, but I will say they have helped me get most of my games and money.  The autobump on outpost definitely helped with visibility and getting priority+ definitely helped this past month or so with all the cheap hats I needed to sell.

If you have any questions of other things I have done ask me questions.  I know I don't have a multiple thousand dollar backpack like some people, but I do know that trading made it so I did not have to buy many games.  I spent about $300 total in real world money, but all other games I got on Origin, Steam, Uplay, and Battle.net were through trading.  I have done small cash outs in the past through Paypal, but this one is my largest and it more than covers ever penny I spent with real world money.

If you're skeptical and don't believe this is real, you can see my last two ""[Have] *X number of* Keys [W] 2.33 Each ONE PER CUSTOMER"" threads in the following links:

[Key Thread 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/15i0gr/h_8_keys_w_233_ref_each_one_per_person/)

[Key Thread 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/15lwlo/h_22_keys_w_233_ref_each_one_per_person/)

Some people are confused as to why I do this. I admit, keys are worth 3.22 refined right now, and selling them for 2.33 refined doesn't leave me with much ""profit."" But, to be honest, I don't really care. It's not about profit to me, it's about being fair. In my opinion, 2.33 is--and always has been--the fair and reasonable price for Mann. Co. Keys. I remember back when I used to save up and craft every weapon I received from drops, and how long it would take to craft 3 refined (which would, back then, be used to craft a hat). Though there are a lot more items in the game now, and a lot more places to get them from, it still doesn't change the fact that a large majority of TF2 players still have to save up for long duration of time to either: a.) buy something they want, or b.) craft a hat/something else. I believe that we must be understanding of everyone's situation, and thus, selling keys for 2.33 refined seems fair to me. It's a reasonable price. It'll still take time for some users to save up for, but at least it's a lot cheaper than most sellers' prices :)

**TL;DR - Key prices are too high. For most people, it takes a long time to build up metal. My way of providing support and understanding to these people, and all users in general, is by selling keys for 2.33 refined. I believe that is, and always has been, the true key price.**

    RULES: Not rules, but *the* rule: Please don't resell my keys for a higher price. I won't know if you do, and won't report you or anything if I find out, but it's just the nice thing to do :)

Thanks /r/tf2trade for always being awesome! You guys are da best :D

0. Uninstall or disable any other flair-linker addons you might have installed.
1. Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
2. Restart Firefox
3. Click ""Install"" on [this page][dl-firefox]
4. Click ""Install"" on the dialog box that appears.
5. Go enjoy your new fancy flair!

## Chrome Installation Instructions

Flair Linker Enhanced is now available on the Chrome App Store. [Install it here.][dl-chrome]

***

***HELP! It won't work!***

First, try these common troubleshooting steps:

* Refresh the page you're on.
* Restart your browser.
* Make sure that Steam Community and SteamRep aren't experiencing downtime. If they go down, the corresponding parts of the script will stop working.
* Reinstall the script.

If that won't work, try posting in the comments below.

Ever since then, I've been hard at work on pushing out a new update for Mist, one that improves stability and brings many improvements.  
For those of you who missed the previous post, [here it is](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1ahkc3/psa_take_your_trading_with_you_wherever_you_go/)! I'll be explaining what Mist is again for the newcomers.

###What is Mist?###
Mist is a portable, open-source Steam client written in C# that allows the user to chat and trade TF2 items.
Mist is something I decided to write because I love doing trades, even away from home. Unfortunately I wasn't always able to go on Steam and trade due to restrictions on installing software, for example, and would miss out on business deals.  
So Mist is intended to be a solution for that. It's portable and doesn't require Steam, which means that you can put it on a flash drive and bring it anywhere with you.  
Mist is built on top of SteamBot (https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/) and heavily uses its underlying functions to handle chat and trading. And of course, it is open-source as well :)  
Scroll to the bottom for the source-code and download link.

###Features###

~~**MIST IS STILL VERY MUCH IN BETA.**~~ Mist is a lot stabler now. But still, expect bugs, and also expect them to be fixed as they are reported. With your help, I'll be able to get it as stable as possible. I wouldn't recommend it for high-value, important trades at the moment, just to be on the safe side.

[Screenshots Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Lwlwc)

* Works with SteamGuard - no need to disable it to use Mist  
* Chat with friends  
* Trade TF2 items - you are limited to trading only TF2 items for now. Adding other types of items will cause the trade to expire.  
* Change display name and status  
* Add friends  
* Block/ignore friends  
* Backpack viewer - view anyone's backpack directly from within the program!  
* SteamRep Checker - check any of your friends' SteamRep status  
* More to come?  

###What doesn't work###

* ~~Friend requests are not shown in Mist. You will have to accept/ignore them manually via steamcommunity.com. This feature will be implemented in a later release~~ **This has now been added**  
* Can only trade TF2 items  
* Occasionally adding items will cause the trade to crash and expire. This is rare but it happens. Close the chat tab, reopen it and trade the other person again.  
* Searching for friends - this is planned for a later release  
* **Linux support** - unfortunately Mist is not compatible with Linux, using either Mono or Wine. Some of the libraries used are incompatible. A separate Linux release is planned in the future, if demand is high enough.  

###Feedback, Contributions and Suggestions###

I've never seen this kind of scam before, so I thought it needs to be brought to attention quickly before more people fall for it.

He was added by a person trying to buy his unusual. (See: [chatlog](http://puu.sh/2hH5V.png))

The scammer posted a link to their actual SteamRep profile, and on first glance it seems to be legit - [the scammer's profile comes up clean](http://puu.sh/2hHhz.png).  
However, there is something very fishy with the SteamRep url he posted.

http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198068807468?t=1345099378

Notice the ?t=1345099378 at the end? This tells SteamRep to pull the profile data **[from a previous point in time](http://puu.sh/2hHis.png)**. When my friend first showed me the link, even I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary at first.

Removing ?t=1345099378 from the URL turns it into http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198068807468 which in fact shows that [the user is a scammer](http://puu.sh/2hHgW.png).

**This is a serious flaw in SteamRep.** I believe that viewing historical data should still show that the user is *currently* a scammer, no matter the state of the profile in the past.

This flaw needs to be fixed ASAP.

Edit: SteamRep has now been updated to make it more clear that it is showing historical data. http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198068807468?t=1345099378

1362873339.0,49,self.tf2trade,19zvu2,[PSA] Remember when I released the source code for my keybanking bot? Now here's the source code for my scrapbanking bot.,54,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/19zvu2/psa_remember_when_i_released_the_source_code_for/,"**Edit (March 10 4:50 AM): I've just fixed a small line of code which caused the bot to fail to ready up and accept the trade. If you've tried to compile the bot or you've forked it, you'll need to update your code to the latest revision.**

Hi everyone. You may remember that I released the source code for my [keybanking bot](https://gist.github.com/waylaidwanderer/5127827) a few months ago.

Well, I'm back again (actually, I've never left), and this time I'm here to give you the source code for my scrapbanking bot! Scrapbanking bots are easy to run, since they don't require you to be rich in TF2 to stock their inventories, and so it's easy to set one up for your own community if you wish to :)

This particular scrapbanking bot of mine does scrap banking and reverse banking. This means that it will sell any 2 weapons for 1 scrap, and buy any 2 weapons for 1 scrap. No profit, just pure service! Of course, you can recode it for-profit if you'd like.

**[You can find the source code as a Gist here.](https://gist.github.com/waylaidwanderer/5126244)**

The scrapbanking bot is coded in C# using Jessecar96 and Geel9's [**SteamBot**](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/), which means you need that first before you can compile the scrapbanking bot.

Once you have SteamBot set up, you can add an empty code file to the project (I called mine ScrapUserHandler.cs), and then paste the content of the source code into the file. Alternatively, you can just replace the contents of SimpleUserHandler.cs with the scrapbanking bot's source code.

**If you do decide to use the scrapbanking code for your own purposes**: it'd be nice if you gave me credit somewhere to let your users know! (You don't need to, of course.)

----------------------

**How to use the scrapbanking bot when trading**

* If you are selling weapons, simply add 2 weapons and the bot will automatically add 1 scrap. If you want to buy weapons, first you must type ""buy"", hit enter, and then type in what weapon you want. For example, if you wanted to buy The Original, type ""original"" and the bot will automatically add it for you if he has one in stock. To add multiple weapons at once, you can separate each search term with a comma. For example, you can type ""original, black"" to tell the bot to add The Original and a Black Box. If the bot has added the wrong item, type ""remove"", hit enter, and the type in the weapon name you wish to remove.

----------------------

**Credit where credit is due - thanks to:**

* Jessecar96 and Geel9 for the inception of SteamBot, allowing me to have hours and hours of fun
* All of SteamBot's [wonderful contributors](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/graphs/contributors)
* [Derongan](http://www.reddit.com/u/derongan) for helping me out a ton when I first started coding my scrapbanking bot

I got the idea from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/17c6dc/hprogramming_ability_w_to_make_a_website_to/) thread where I came upon a post stating that the old user script that someone wrote is outdated; specifically [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/11p0lv/psa_tf2outpost_and_backpacktf_integration_script/) script.

Unfortunately the plugin only works on Chrome as of right now, although the only other browser I really tested is Firefox on Linux, so it might work on Windows still. I am however working on a native Firefox extension and hope to have it done soon.

As far as features go it only grabs the prices from TF2 and displays them. I do however plan on adding more features in the future (which is why I ported it from a user script to a Chrome extension; I can push updates when features are done).

You can install it as a [user script](https://github.com/kschat/tf2outpost-prices) (requires Grease/TamperMonkey; also won't be updated in the future) or as a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tf2outpost-price-integrat/ndflpbfgklcjpkepbmfgjjancaocpnmp/details?hl=en&amp;gl=US) (will be updated in the future).

Please let me know what you guys think, if you found any bugs, and suggestions for features!

EDIT: There was a bug with cross domain requesting and permissions with the Chrome extension. It's fixed now. Make sure you have version 1.1.4, sorry for the confusion. 

EDIT 2: If you had a version that wasn't working and updated  ake sure you clear your cache and data hosted by apps after you update (it might be reading for a ""corrupt"" value in local storage).

EDIT 3: to anyone who is getting an error saying ""Download was not a CRX"" it's a bug with the Google Web Store. According to [this](http://www.ghacks.net/2012/12/07/fix-chrome-error-download-was-not-a-crx/) you need to be logged into the store to fix the bug. 

UPDATE: Version 1.1.6 has been released. It now factors in paint to the price of painted items. I also added a ""never ending tf2outpost"" feature (much like the ""never ending reddit"" RES feature).

Apparently it'll come with a nifty tf2 item (from what it appears), so that's an nice little plus. Likely the bear thing on the heavy. 

All participants pick a number between 1 and 200. Be sure to answer in the 000 format. So 50 would be 050, 6 would be 006, etc. etc.

Don't look for too long though; we've got an appointment with Cleopatra and George Louis Stevenson and I'd hate to let them down on their hats. Oh, wait, we're in a time machine, take your time.

**Hats**; These hats are the finest human history has to offer, each with their own backstory. They're also discounted!

* ~~**The Fed-Fightin' Fedora**~~: *Yours for only *1.33 Refined!** This hat once belonged to a bank robber so infamous, his name was censored by the American legal system for fear of causing panic attacks. The man in question believed that shooting holes in his hat would allow him to avoid capture when escaping banks by posing as one of his own dead victims. Believe it or not, this tactic served him well on 36 of this 37 successful robberies; the 37th involved him dressing as a giant duck, which worked well, until police found the head of said costume in his house and he was tried for his crimes.

* **The Grenadier's Softcap**: *A bargain at *1.66 Refined!** This hat belonged to one of the fiercest chefs ever to walk the battlefield. Sure, it's not very chef-like, but it served Borris Von Cookoff so well that he personally credited it responsible for the *18-course meal* he successfully cooked for his superiors during the bloodbath that was the 18th Regiment's failed training exercise. Notorious for the fact that the soldiers believed the enemy had landed in the grounds of the training field, this friendly-fire incident cost *fourteen-thousand* lives and one of the commanders a damn good bottle of scotch. This hat smells faintly of the salmon mousse which it contained on that fateful day. There may be a live grenade still inside it, we don't dare to lift it out of the crate it came in. **Are you manly enough to own this?**

**Miscs**; Whilst not as suitable for warming your head as hats, these certainly make the man, or rather, his composure.

* ~~**Dillinger's Duffel**~~: *Wow! Cheap at *2 Refined!** You may be wondering to yourself *""Why don't they just take the money out of that thing and use it? It's perfectly good, right?""* **Wrong.** What you mistook for real money is actually *fake money*. We're not just banging two Monopoly sets together and seeing what pops out here, we've manufactured that money on the finest toilet paper money can buy, just for you! That's right, that makes it more valuable than real money, but it has all the appearance of normal money, meaning you'll be less of a target for pickpockets, ragamuffins, and scallywaggers! In addition to this, we've packed it into a lead-lined leather case, so, when you're lugging that obscenely heavy bag of money around, you'll be assured your money will survive the next nuclear war, even if you won't.

**Collector's Items**; Are you feeling fancy? Your glowing, burning, or swarming hat not enough to show off? Then here's what you'll need!

* ~~**Genuine Widowmaker**~~: **1 Refined!* They must be MAD!* This weapon may look like an average Widowmaker, but with one crucial difference; it has a green name. That's right, *GREEN*, the colour of precious money! Show off how opulent you can be with a weapon that not only reflects your wealth, but also your choice in fine weaponry! What's more is that this special-edition item is only in a limited quantity, making it a perfect investment for a rainy day; not that you'd ever need to sell it, you rich haberdasher, you. In fact, you're so rich, why not just give all your money to us? That time machine doesn't run on gravel, you know. It needs liquid money *(don't ask)*.

* ~~**Mann Co. Supply Crate Key**: *THIS PRICE IS SO MAD, I'M SHOUTING! *2.33 Refined!**~~ **SOLD** Despite the fact that we only have one of these for sale, I'm sure you'll enjoy the fact that this key can unlock so many (*one*) doors (*crates*) that your mind is boggled! In fact, don't use this thing, just stare at it for all it's shiny worth. *This key may unbox an unusual!* Personally, I'd be happier with the shiny key. Mmmm...

Well, time is ticking on, and so I must be gone. You know what to do! Pick up that phone, call that cat, and use the timey-wimey detector to find out where I am, or, alternatively, use the special flair which you probably can't can't find anywhere else to send me a trade request!

2. Use a simple tag to identify traders. Example: zxc. This enables you to find traders who you've added in a snap.

The raffler may choose to use filters to *only* enter comments with ""entering"", or not enter comments with ""not entering"" (for example, these filters may be any character/words). You may also specify minimum comment/link karma, and account age. Once again, these are filters for the raffler to specify himself.

Our Steam forums were defaced on the evening of Sunday, November 6. We began investigating and found that the intrusion goes beyond the Steam forums.

We learned that intruders obtained access to a Steam database in addition to the forums. This database contained information including user names, hashed and salted passwords, game purchases, email addresses, billing addresses and encrypted credit card information. We do not have evidence that encrypted credit card numbers or personally identifying information were taken by the intruders, or that the protection on credit card numbers or passwords was cracked. We are still investigating.

We don’t have evidence of credit card misuse at this time. Nonetheless you should watch your credit card activity and statements closely.

While we only know of a few forum accounts that have been compromised, all forum users will be required to change their passwords the next time they login. If you have used your Steam forum password on other accounts you should change those passwords as well.

We do not know of any compromised Steam accounts, so we are not planning to force a change of Steam account passwords (which are separate from forum passwords). However, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to change that as well, especially if it is the same as your Steam forum account password.

We will reopen the forums as soon as we can.

I am truly sorry this happened, and I apologize for the inconvenience.

Gabe.

So I got this bright idea to give my Unusual away today, what do you guys think? 

Hat in question is a Armored Authority with Purple Confetti

First the why: It's fun as hell to do and brings a little bit of joy to my day, as well as the winners. I have done giveaways in the past, but no unusuals.  Seeing that ass from tf2raffle take back his unusual raffle kind of pushed me to go though with this (i had been thinking about it a while).

Next, the how: I will be accepting the numbers 1-50 as an entrance to this raffle. The winner will be announced live tomorrow morning (around 10am CST in the tf2trade chat group). Now I will not limit who can enter this, but if you have 10 unusuals chilling in your bp, don't be an ass and let someone else have a shot at one. 

So there it is. A free unusual to one lucky redditor. Btw, I had thought of doing this in tf2 for the larger group, but have had some good times in the tf2trade servers, so did it here instead.

I am starting a 1:1 weapons exchange because I don't think people should have to pay more than 1 weapon for 1 weapon.  This is as non-profit as it gets.  I do not want any extra weapons, I do not want one scrap per weapon.  If you really want to give me an extra weapon I'll take it and the next person who wants something off me gets it free.  If you want one of my weapons and all you have is a scrap then you get 2 weapons.  If you want to help me out all I ask is that you see if you can swap me a weapon I don't have in stock, absolutely at your discretion of course.  My selection is modest for now but hopefully will get better.  Ed: Big injection of stock thanks to a guy in desperate need of a scrapbanker.

One last thing for those of you who made it this far.  While I was scrapbanking some sneaky person has given me 6 uncraftable weapons.  So my loss is your gain.  If you want these weapons to use and not to craft you can have them absolutely free.

I was trading a bit to try and get all the strange weapons I wanted for my main classes, and have managed to end up with a few surplus as a result. I don't have the patience to try to trade or sell them, so I figured I'd give them to my reddit brothers and sisters who will make good use of them!

Not having a specific item in mind is cool, and you never know what might come drifting in, but you *must* include a buyout or value with your trade. For example:

* **[H] LFD2 [W] Offers** will get your post spam-filtered.
* **[H] LFD2 [W] Eight Refined or Offers** is kosher.

Also:

* **[H] Valve Complete [W] Metal** ain't cool, either. When posting something like that, you obviously know how much you're willing to settle for, but just want to see if somebody will overpay. Post a price. If somebody has an offer that's close, either take it or hold out for more. But nobody likes to take shots in the dark without knowing what the other party wants.

If you aren't sure how how to price your stuff, ask around. Search Google, look at the various trading forums, or post here. Lots of people are happy to help you value your stuff, and this community prides itself on giving advice to new traders. Also, if you're only trading games, Coal, or coupons, /r/steamgameswap would be a better place to get some trading done. If your post doesn't involve *Team Fortress 2* in some fashion, it will be removed.

The one gray area is new, rare stuff, such as the Festive Hats obtained through the Steam Great Gift Pile, which have no set market price at the moment and the only way to determine one is by shopping around for offers. New hats, new Unusual effects, new items all fall into this gray area. But after a few days and things settle down, decide on a price and don't settle for less.

You just have to trade the bot in-game, and it'll act as a scrap banker. (Any two weapons = 1 scrap).

Just do a direct trade **in TF2** with the bot using its profile link:

http://steamcommunity.com/id/TF2pc_Scrap_Bot/

The bot's also designed to craft weapons together automatically, so it should always have a solid supply of scrap. That also means that there's no real profit in this for anyone; it's just offered as a service to the community. Everything happens within a single trade, so there's no scam potential or anything. It doesn't work via Steam Trade (yet), but I'd imagine it will eventually.

Anyways, just thought it was a cool bit of automation, and wanted to let you guys know about it.

EV is in ref**
---

Hey again! 

Decided to update my spreadsheet calculating the profitability of uncrating.  The previous thread was [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/wb3jh/psa_the_truth_behind_mann_co_supply_crates/).

I updated old prices for all series, phased out Series 46.  Decided not to do the winter crates cause they'd be expiring soon enough.

I grabbed all the data I could from backpack.tf/unusual.  Piped each hat to Sheet2 of the spreadsheet and found out I could just grab the data from the website on demand through excel.  If you download the spreadsheet, you should get that security warning.  It was done in Excel 2010 but there shouldn't be all too many problems with compatability, except maybe on the on demand price updates.

Then to get that data in an easier format to work with, all 5367 lines of price data, wrote a script (see bottom for link) to better crunch all the data.  Hindsight I could have probably done an easier job with find and replace functions in notepad++, but the script didn't take entirely too long to write and can easily deal with updates in prices.

For those not familiar with Python, it's heavily commented.  Just open it in a text editor.

Some notable things:
---

* Remember: Both the sell value of the crate and the value of the key are subtracted from the value of the items you might uncrate.
* Crates are now profitable, long term, to open.
* This is because of a calculated average unusual cost of 3.73 buds

*Note: For those who wanted the st dev, open up the spreadsheet.  When I first submitted it people wanted it, and for some reason Excel wouldn't have a 3 column sort.*
---

Table: Crates by order of profitability of opening

EV= Expected Value

I multiplied the value of the items you can unbox by the rate at which they are unboxed.  Summed all that and subtracted the value of the crate and key.

[crates.xlsx](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22365883/valve/crates.xlsx). Crate calculations are on Sheet1, Unusual raw data on Sheet2

[pricestripper.py](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22365883/valve/pricestripper.py). Heavily commented, script to turn the raw price data on unusuals into easily usable data.  Then, manipulate that data (averages and st dev).  I ran a test with a smaller data set (20 actual data points to be extracted, with expected non-data entries and ranges) and then calculated by hand, everything matched up.  If you see an error in my code, **PLEASE** let me know. Done in v3.3.

This email came in *immediately* after I accepted a PayPal payment from somebody else just earlier today, and all the links genuinely go to PayPal and not some phishing site, so I'm 99% certain that this letter is legit.

I'm not too familiar with how this sort of thing would be taxed. I have always accepted payments in the form of a personal gift, so I was under the assumption that these payments were not taxed at all. Have I been mistaken?

Does anybody have any clue what other ramifications this may have for us PayPal traders? ",,False,,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,t3_w732q,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/w732q/q_are_my_trades_being_reported_to_the_irs_now/,
1340993900.0,45,self.tf2trade,vt0x9,[Store] Flutter's absolutely gigantic super awesome pretty big store. Now featuring 11 unusuals!,61,16,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/vt0x9/store_flutters_absolutely_gigantic_super_awesome/,"**I am exhausted. That's been 4 hours of pretty solid trading. I apologise for the long waits people had (I had a LOT of people). I plan to reopen the store at about 12PM GMT tomorrow. Be there! :D**

http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecommieduck

So yes, I have a lot of stuff. I'll probably re-run another one of these tomorrow when I have more time...but I felt like doing one tonight too.

I plan to be on tonight for another **half an hour; I am tired now.**. Please not this is **not always up to date due to so many people**

My advice is to search my backpack.

All prices are **negotiable to a degree, moreso as the price/volume of stuff you buy increases.** Feel free to add me, I do not bite. Upvotes always appreciated. First come first served, so please add me on steam. A lot of prices (especially ? ones) I guess so they are really flexible.

I also take items at an overpay; **I am not currently accepting new stuff most of the time, due to pricing going everywhere.**

Anyway, here is all my stuff. I take keys at 2.55 ref and can add for them. I take buds at $30 and can do up to $30 of cash without rep.


**Unusual Hats - A lot of these I just got, and as such B/Os will not be set to a really cheap price so I can field some offers. I will take lower than B/O price on most of these obviously.**

One of the regulars, someone I was friends with and chatted with a lot, was practically broke in TF2. He was envious of my first and only dream unusual, a beams crocleather slouch. Just an hour ago I told him I'd let him use it for a couple rounds just for fun. As soon as the trade was complete, he disconnected from the server, removed all members of the server group from his friends list, and changed his profile name. I've been tracking the hat and saw someone put it up for trade on outpost. I commented on it, but he promptly marked the trade done and changed his name. I've reported both of them and am not sure what to do.

I get why the price is changing, but I just feel like there's so many benefits of a key being exactly 4 ref.

1. Keys are easily divided now. 1/2 of a key is 2 ref, 1/4 is 1 ref, 1/10 is 0.38 ref, etc., as all you have to do is divide 4 by the required amount and round to closest scrap(instead of 2.33 or 3.77, ugh).

2. Keys go 1:3 with craft hats. Seriously a big feature when you can easily trade hats instead of metal without having to calculate change. This could be even more awesome if scrap.tf allowed you to sell 3 hats for 1 key (or vice versa) in just one trade!

3. Larger value currencies are also easily traded for metal and hats. Bills are exactly 32 ref, or 24 hats. Buds go for 104-8 ref, or 78-81 hats. HOUWARS would fetch some 1144-1296 ref, or 858-972 hats! And all this with an easy to remember formula- just multiply keys by 4 for ref prices, or by 3 for hat prices.

Please leave feedback.,49,7,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/13uggf/psa_steam_value_new_and_improved_steam_pricing/,"Hello all.  This is an update to my previous posts.  I had a previous version of the website at www.steamprice.blogspot.com.  The new and improved website can be found at www.steamvalue.com.  We have worked hard improving the website and think we have come up with a pretty good product.  Please let us know if you have any feedback!  

We have just made the switch to this new website, I hope everyone enjoys it.  The purpose of this website is to provide the current, lowest, and average price of the top 100 selling games on Steam.  But more importantly, these prices are then calculated, using our own unique algorithm, to provide the equivalent price in both Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 keys.  

+
+

if you like, join us at this subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/steamvalue/

We will be hosting a raffle for some TF2 items soon.  Please stay tuned.

+
+

Change log:
 
-Draws the current price from Steam

-Stores the lowest price for the year

-Auto-updating!  

-Revolutionized UI

-Search function

-Game images

-Link to store page in title

-Now holds top 100 selling

-Current price shows green if the value is less than or equal to the lowest price

+
+

On the website, TF2 keys are valued at $1.30 and Dota 2 keys are valued at $1.85.

+
+

Future changes include possibly implementing a voting system to the prices/key prices.  More games and more pages.

+
+

Once again the url is www.steamvalue.com

Thanks again,
Matt

Hey guys, this is a pretty long post so I really do hope you read everything! :3

You may know me from [an announcement I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ws4ye/psa_come_join_the_community_trade_server_where/) last week about setting up a new trade server, focusing on trading with a sense of community.

It hasn't been that popular, but it has gotten a fair amount of people occasionally. So I got to thinking, ""how can I help make my trade server more popular, and have more people join, and hopefully come back regularly?"" 

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, I decided to organize an event, hosted on my trade server, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His parter?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday, 12 PM PST**, I will be hosting an epic battle on my server! I call it: ""The Huntsman and the Spy"". 

---------------------------------

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers, and 7 spies.

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map, but spies are allowed.

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!), and the goal of each sniper will be to use their Huntsman to take out enemy snipers on the other side of the map. Your spy partner can either hang around you to protect you from enemy spies, or they can choose to sneak their way across the map and backstab enemy snipers. 

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats, until there are 3 semi-finalist teams on Red and Blu. 

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, the last team standing on Red or Blu will move to the final round. In the second round, the semi-finalists must keep battling until there is a winner on the team that did not win the first time (e.g. If a team on Blu won the first time, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round, the two teams must go head to head with each other. Sniper vs sniper, with both spies trying to protect their sniper and take out the other sniper and spy. The first sniper to die will cause their team to lose.

And that's it for the rules!

I will be announcing the grand prizes (one for the Sniper and one for the Spy, along with the prizes for each of the round winners) tomorrow. The grand prizes are both worth a couple keys each, and *if people are kind enough to donate*, the winners will get even more cool stuff! 

#**If you are interested in registering for this tournament, please fill out this fancy form [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHVOTVg0a21VdFJMN09BTm1nYlZrRnc6MQ). You MUST have a partner to be your Spy or Sniper before you can enter! So tell a buddy or an online friend about this. :) It is up to you to decide who will be who.**

The list of competitors will be announced on **~~Wednesday~~ Thursday**, along with the team that they will be on, so check back for the post! Join my Steam group as well [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CommunityTrade) so you'll know when I make the announcement!

Now, onto...

------------------------------------

###**The Giveaway**

There will be a giveaway every day of this week up until the Saturday event. The prizes will get better and better!

Today's prize: Degreaser, Reserve Shooter, and Axtinguisher (my favourite Pyro loadout, incidentally).

Pick a number **between 1 and 200**. Please do a Ctrl+F and make sure your number is not already taken! If multiple people have the same winning number, the first one that picked the number will be the winner.

When this post is 22 hours old, or at 12 PM PST on Tuesday, the winner will be announced, along with the next giveaway.

----------------------------------

Well, this is me hoping that everything will work out and we'll all have a blast on Saturday!

Don't forget to check out my trade server! Occasionally, I will be running the map that the event will be hosted on (trade_compound), so you guys can come explore and get a feel of the land, so to speak.

How is it themed one might dare to question. The answer is simple.

 The king of cheap drinks and Iced teas (Arizona) has a beverage called Peace Tea. Peace Tea is peace related. AND comes in cans. This hat is both Peace related and it has cans on not just ONE SIDE, but on **BOTH SIDES**.

Now you might be questioning whether or not this mighty fine hat even worthy of you to own it. (Don't worry you all can have a chance to own it for the right price) BUT this hat will not discriminate against anybody or anything because it is peaceful. A whole **two cans** of peaceful.

The latest TF2 update seems to have rendered sourcemod and metamod: source inoperable on a server. The only solution is to run the server without these addons. **However,** we are unable to do this because our servers need these addons to be able to record our bans, upload our bans to [our ban database](http://bans.tf2trade.com), and then give our ban list to steamrep. This is also how we prevent other scammers from other communities to be able to join our servers and scam you guys.

**As of right now, the servers are in an unstable state.** Trade server 1 will crash once the player count gets too high. It will randomly crash whenever the hell it feels like it. Trade server 2 is somewhat more stable, but can crash at any moment. At the time of writing this, trade server 1 has 0/32 people (due to crashing not long ago) and trade server 2 has 24/32 players from being slightly more stable. I will be able to fix this once metamod: source and sourcemod both release updated plugins for the continued use of our servers.

I'm sorry guys, this is the best that I can do, other than completely taking the servers offline. I hope you will understand the situation that valve has put us in. Sorry for the inconvenience. Hopefully updated plugins will be released within the next day or so.

This is the second pay-what-you-want weapon bundle. That’s right, pay-what-you-want for weapons of your choice.

With incentives, of course.

Proceeds will go towards funding a relatively new project, which I am co-founding with two **awesome** guys.

This project, currently known as Saxtons, will provide gifts for those recently scammed. I am sure many of you know what it is like to be scammed. How much better would you feel if some random guy friended you, and gave you that sharp dresser you have been looking for, saying how sorry they felt for you? Well, that is what we are doing, and this store will hopefully get it kick-started. If you wish to donate, or have extraordinary skills that we might put to use, add me to chat!

So, without further a-due, the Macro Pay-What-You-Want Store.

Now, you may have found yourself asking, ""I'd like to get into trading, but how do I protect myself from being cheated or how do I know the true value on my items?"" Well, I'd like to try to help as many of you as I can to get you started on a path to trading.



Now you may be saying, well who am I to teach you? Truthfully, not anybody special. I'm not a huge trader or anything, but I've been around for awhile, and have done everything from trading unusuals, to games, to keys and metal. I can hopefully outline some things to help you awesome redditors out! Now then, enough of introductions, let's get down to business...


**The Basics**

Okay, so I know this may already be highlighted in some other Reddit posts, but just as a run down, here are the general value of some of the ""currency"" items of tf2:

* [Refined Metal](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Refined#Metal) - 1 Ref (Around $0.55 atm)
Please note: 1 Scrap = .11 Refined, 1 Reclaimed = .33 Refined

* [Keys](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Key) - 2.44-2.55 Ref (Around $1.45 atm)

* [Bills Hat](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Earbuds) - 8-9 keys (Unpainted) or 9-10 keys (Painted) (Generally $10-$11.50)

* [Earbuds](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Earbuds) - 24-25 keys($28-$30 atm). Buds are king, these are the ultimate currency atm, and are also the hardest to get away from the many hoarders the game has brought about. Used to buy pretty much anything.
* [Severed Max Head](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Refined#Metal) - Around 2.33-2.5 buds each ($65-$70)

These are the current values of each currency item. Please note that buds are really changing constantly, as is the monetary value of these items, so I'll update as often as I can!

**Knowing The Value Of Your Items**

If you're looking to get into trading, knowing the value of your items is critical. Luckily, there are a few websites that you can use for ballpark estimates on all of your things!

* [Tf2 Spreadsheet:](http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.com/)


This spreadsheet is great for giving ballpark estimates of what your items and valuables should go for. Of course it's not 100% accurate, I personally like to sell my things for around 2 scraps below the spreadsheet if I want to sell my items quickly.

* [TF2 Unusual:](http://tf2unusual.com/tf2/)


Not sure what your unusual is worth, or how desired it is? This site, although honestly at times highly unreliable, is great for giving an okay estimate at what the demand for your unusual is. Be sure to take prices with a grain of salt here, as anybody can put any sort of number they want. By no means use it as a solid price checker, but it *can* be a good place to find somebody interested in your unusual.


* Want a more in-depth look at unusual values? I've made a small Google Doc which can be viewed here:

 [TF2 Unusuals And You](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8wnhJRbk8wKlhqyPse37rjbllFSgkvIzACVL6KFqLI/edit)

* You can also check out [Burpman's](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Burpman/) Unusual guide [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ocjn7/a_guide_to_unusual_value/)



**Trading Your Things**
Now then, you've got yourself acquainted and have a general knowledge of the price of your item(s). What next? Well, you can of course post here and see who all is interested, but there are also a number of other venues for you to sell all your shineys!


[TF2 Outpost](http://www.tf2outpost.com/):
TF2 Outpost is a fantastic website for all of your trading needs. Unusuals, miscs, random weapons, even Steam games. Anything you've got, they'll list! You can also comment and view other peoples' comments there, so it's much like Reddit.


[TF2 Trading Post](http://tf2tp.com/)
While a little bulkier and less popular now-a-days, TF2 Trading Post is also another good website to trade your things if you want to have the full range of users seeing what you've got for sale.


[Sourceop](http://www.sourceop.com/)
Used mostly for unusual trading, Sourceop is a great place to go to list those valuable unusuals you've been lucky enough to unbox! You can also find middlemen for your cash trades, rep threads aplenty, and lots of other things for all of your unusual and high-value trading desires.


**Scammers: What to Expect, What to Avoid**
Luckily, the fine gentlemen of Reddit have already come up with a great guide to prevent getting scammed during all of your trading adventures, which can be viewed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jhyte/common_trade_scams_and_how_to_avoid_them/). I'd highly recommend you check this out, and become well situated with it if you wish to trade for cash later on! As a rule of thumb, always look for a high rep person, or worst case scenario, *always* have a middleman ready.


**Hints and Tips**

* For those looking to uncrate:
Buy keys from here, or from Sourceop. You can easily find people selling *well* under the price in the Mann Co. Store (Around $1.40-$1.45, sometimes even lower!) It's a great thing for those new traders who just want to unbox, and I've even sold some keys to two people who've unboxed unusuals.

* For those looking for price checks and other such things:
My Unusual trading Google Doc above gives two great websites for getting people to price check things, but if you're in urgent need of a price check, simply toss me an add and I'll try to give you a ballpark estimate to the best of my knowledge.


**The Wrap Up**
So that's about it for now. You know the values, you know the websites, and you want to get trading! If you don't quite have anything yet, the best advice I can give is to just keep it up! Play to your hearts desire, and remember, every week you get more items from random drops, which you'll be able to trade and sell and build yourself up. If you have any questions, or just want to chat with me, feel free to add me through my flair or by visiting my profile [here](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sound_Off). I'd be more than happy to try to answer any questions you may have.


Thanks for taking the time to read this long guide, and as always, happy trading!

I hope you had fun with the Secret Santa event, and we really hope we get more of you to sign up when we repeat it next year (or maybe sooner :D).

I know we had a few problems with the system, and we plan on working to solve them for future events. Using the Reddit message system for notifications was an easy and fast solution, but caused several unforeseen problems.


**************************************

It is also time for the ugly part of the exchange that I wish I didn't have to do. We will now start sanctioning those who haven't delivered their gifts to their giftees. Only a few cases have risen, and most are due to scheduling difficulties and the holiday vacations. I'll be reviewing each case individually.


If you have received a matching PM in the past, and sent a gift but NOT received one, please message me with the title: ""**Bad santa**"". If you have tried contacting your giftee, but have not been able to, don't worry; message me with the title ""**No Chimney**"", and the details.

All shafted participants will get a gift one way or another, so don't worry, since I have already been contacted by people willing to regift, and I'll take care of you personally if I have to :D

Remember that if you think you signed up, but never received a PM informing you of it, you were most likely never matched. We are sorry about such cases, but out poor little bot (programmed by the amazing [Virindi](http://www.reddit.com/user/virindi), without who's help none of this would have been possible) sometimes couldn't handle some of Reddit's hiccups. We'll have more time to avoid this in the future.

**************************

**And now for the awesomeness!**

Be sure to visit /r/tf2gifts to browse through some of the gifts! Many, if not most of you, went above and beyond the minimum requirement set, and gave away everything from personalized unusuals to great games!


This event was made possible thanks to the great community we have. Keep being awesome, /r/tf2trade!

Welcome to the *third* pay-what-you-want weapon store! Pay 1 scrap for 2 weapons, or pay 1 bud for 3! It’s all up to you!

This store has some very special incentives however, unlike most pay-what-you-want stores.

100% of *all* profit gets liquidated and donated to [thebogg.org](http://thebogg.org) This is a very cool project that gives out food to people who need it for free! So, you’re turning pixels into food! Worth it? We think so! (We also encourage direct cash donations, and you can send us the receipt for your position on the top contributors list.) 

----------------------------------------

***HOW THIS WORKS.***

We have two people who will be trading with everyone. Myself (macropower) and Hagabao. You can pick and choose up to 6 weapons (if you are paying minimum) or up to 20 (if you are paying average or above). You can view both backpacks, and choose what weapons you want from each. It is recommended that you stick to just one backpack, just because it makes it simpler for us (we both have the same stuff, give or take a few weapons.)

**Please don’t add us. Post a comment below, and we’ll add you.**

**Please upvote for visibility! :)** (we gain no karma)

**Backstory:** [This guy, brooksfosho,](http://www.reddit.com/user/brooksfosho) gave me a Vintage Ushanka and 3 ref for **free**. Show this guy all the love.

He said it was for giving regular price checks or something along those lines. I've gotten his approval to raffle this away.

3. Optional: Draw out your dream unusual.

4. Don't downvote other people. It's something that goes on here when free stuff gets given out. I know this is something I can't control, but I hope you guys won't do it. It won't increase your chances of winning.

Winner will be picked via random.org. I'm not going to record my screen because it's too troublesome, but rest assured I'm not going to rig the thing.

Hey there r/tf2trade, and welcome to my little Screenshot Service ""store"" ^ ^

Ever want a screenshot of you and all of those funny things you wear on your head, but you just didn't know what to do to get a good shot? Well then you've come to the right place!

For a limited time (until mid-April) I shall be taking screenshots (and even editing them!) for **free**!

*(Donations appreciated, but not required :3)*

---

So how does this work? Easy! Just follow these steps:

* **Know what you want a screenshot of** - *I mainly take shots of Unusuals, but I do get requests of just regular shots every now and then*

* *Try* to **think of a map/setting you'd like as a background** - *Example: Burning Hats go nicely with a dark background, Cloudy Moon hats go nicely with a night background, Bubbles and Stormy Hats go nicely with water backgrounds, and so on*

* **Comment/PM/Add me!**

After doing all of this, we can discuss further and make plans on how we'd like to make these photos happen!

* **Discuss/Plan**

* **Run around a server and pose/taunt/do whatever**! I'll be a spectator taking screenshots of you ^ ^

**No trust required, you keep your hat at all times!**

**Why am I doing this?**

A couple of reasons - mainly to practice my photo-editing skills (I'm taking Photography class and I am planning on taking designing courses later on as well), but also to help people out with their sales, since I know from first-hand experience how hard it is to sell Unusuals. And also for fun!

Anyways thanks for looking, and as always feel free to comment/PM/add me if you'd like to take part in my services, *or* if you have any questions, comments or concerns.

See this blog post for more info: http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html

This means that r/tf2trade will be inaccessible for the afternoon of the previously stated date. You won't be able to post trades during the blackout.

If you're planning on trading on the stated date or are thinking about it but have no plans exactly, you should find an alternative trading site before next week. Good alternatives are [TF2Outpost](http://tf2outpost.com), [TF2WH](http://tf2wh.com) for the ""need-it-now"" traders, [TF2TP](http://tf2tp.com), or, in the worst case scenario, trade servers.

There have been no plans from the r/tf2trade mods and server admins on whether or not the trade servers will go dark, so those are also a good alternative. ~~Keep in mind that things may change, but as it stands right now, no trade server blackout is planned. Other trade servers not those of r/tf2trade will likely stay up, but they could decide to black out too.~~ **edit: lawlyer confirms no trade server/chat room blackout will take place: http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/oblrz/attentionpsa_plan_on_finding_other_trading/c3fylwx?context=3**

While Valve has not been approached about SOPA/PIPA, keep in mind that while unlikely at this time, they could blackout Steam if they wanted to. Unlikely, but still a possibility. Do note that the previously mentioned sites may also be blacking out too, but you'll likely receive warning through their notification systems.

1312972419.0,41,self.tf2trade,jegmi,PROPOSED RULE: You may trade for games available on Steam ,47,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jegmi/proposed_rule_you_may_trade_for_games_available/,"Since people are already posting trades with games, and the ""yes"" has over 100 up votes with no having 2, I think we have a clear winner. 

Below is the proposed rule for allowing the trade of games. Keep in mind, this is only **proposed** and if no major flaws are within the rule, it will become active within 24-48 hours.

In the mean time, any trade for games must comply with the proposed rule. 

***
**RULE FOR TRADING STEAM GAMES IN /r/TF2TRADE**

1. The proposed game to be traded must be able to be traded in the Steam trade window via Steam trade.

2. The trade **must** have TF2 items involved

3. Know the value of your TF2 items. You won't be able to trade for a $50 game with only equalizers and backburners.  

4. The moderators and game admins take zero responsibility and will have zero recourse available if the other party does not complete the trade.

5. No posts will be allowed complaining of another person backing out of a trade.

6. It is preferred that the user already **own** the copy of the game they want to trade.

7. ""[H] (insert game here) [W] Offers"" is not acceptable. You must state exactly what items you want offered.
***

**Note on scams:** Trade at your own risk. Currently, this is still in beta and may still have bugs. There also is still a chance of scamming available. Make sure the game that is being traded *is* the game you agreed to and not DLC or something else. 

* It is *highly* suggested that you demo your screen when conducting these trades. 

* It is *highly* suggested to not purchase games for a trade, only trade what you have. Meaning if someone says ""I want $15 worth of Steam Games"" and you go out and buy it instead of trading what you already have.  If the other guy backs out of a trade after you spend a ton of money on games - **there is absolutely nothing that the moderators or game admins can do**. The simple solution is **DO NOT TAKE THE RISK!** 

* Watch the ""Item"" text box to ensure what has been put in the box is what you think has been put in the box.

**Remember:** Best trade practices do apply. Always research the other guy, prices, etc. Once the trade is done, it is done

http://steamcommunity.com/id/key-seller/

Follow the instructions to buy keys.

**How much does it cost?**

The price will fluctuate, type price in the chat box to display the current price.

**What's the current stock?**

Type stock in the chat box to display the current stock.

**Why is your bot trying to communicate?**

Any non-command chat message will trigger a response from Cleverbot.

**Any known bugs?**

If you purchase a large amount of keys, it will probably tell you the trade *might have* failed. It won't have failed 99% of the time, but I left that warning there just in case.

For a few users, the trade might expire every single time. I am looking into that.

**How can I be sure it works?**

I am the owner and the only admin of the bot. If anything goes wrong, I can assure you that you will get your keys or your money back.

Additionally, I can guarantee that I will be online until this post is 3 hours old.

**What if I decide to initiate a chargeback?**

Don't do that. Contact me if you want a refund.

**Is this thing on 24/7?**

Yes, except when it goes down for maintenance. That shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

**What's with the flat fee?**

PayPal's fault. It should be less than or equivalent to the fee you pay when buying keys from a human. There are no other fees here.

**And what's that about free keys?**

If you find a bug that allows an user to get free keys or stops the bot from confirming a payment, and the problem is reproducible, add me for your free CS:GO/Dota 2/TF2 summer/robo key.

Cheers everyone.

Yep, you read right. I'm just giving it away. Don't want to deal with TF2 anymore. As fun as it is, it's mostly a black hole for my time and money. I'd prefer to just give it all to one person, to simplify the process. Don't want to ""cash out"" just want to do something nice for someone else. I won't lie and tell you that I have an incredible collection, but there's some good stuff.

How will I decide? Well post three things: 1) Your favorite book 2) Your favorite N64 game 3) What historical figure would you tickle and why?

&gt;In 1 weeks time we will be **requiring** you to have flair to submit trades and comment on the subreddit. We have some new back-end tools at our disposal that will make moderating easier for us. Flair being required also means no posts from people who don't leave their SteamID and don't have flair. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**How do I update my flair?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Go to http://trade.redditgaming.com/start and go through the two logins to receive approved submitter status on the subreddit. Once you go through this process and receive a message from SteamBot saying you're an approved submitter, you're finished completely. Simple as that!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**I already have flair, do I need to do it again through this system?** 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yes, you'll need to go through the process once to get approved submitter status on the subreddit. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Can I change the steam account associated with my reddit account?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Currently, no. The SteamID you sign up with is tied to your reddit account, so make sure you are logged into the correct accounts before you sign up for flair.

The CTS Community is a group of friendly and awesome people! I built up most of my community from fellow Redditors like us, along with other great people who have shared fun times and great memories with us.

To promote my server, and to get people to join our community (here's our [***Steam group***](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity), please feel free to join us!), here's the **fourth** raffle of the week!

I'm sorry about the delay in getting this one up today; I had a final exam for Calculus in the morning. Hopefully I did okay, but I'm kind of worried I'll fail the course and have to retake it :/

If you'd like to donate, refer to the last section below :)

*How do you enter?*

Well, simple! All you have to do is comment and include the words ""I love free items and I am not ashamed of it!"" (quotes not required) exactly how it's spelled, punctuated, written and capitalized. It's okay to write other things in your comment if you wish!

Upvotes are not required but *will be appreciated*. :) And maybe join my [***Steam group***](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity)? That would be awesome!

Just a heads-up. Use a middleman, or whatever, if that really works, but know this: you are no more protected from chargebacks on gifts than on any other payment method.

No I'm not cancelling it or anything. That title is kind of misleading but hell if I can think of a better one.

The gist of the post is this: I was planning on maybe the 18th, Saturday, as the date for the stream, but then gosh-darn MvM came out.

I pretty much psyched my pants, and if you guys are anything like me, you just want to play the hell out of it. So I was thinking of pushing my event back a bit so that you don't have to choose one or the other.

If most of you guys want me to do it anyway, I will. I'm not going to delay it just so I can play MvM if you all still want it to happen now. I just figured I'd get some input before making a decision.

Let me know what you think! When enough people have replied, I will make an announcement in the Steam group. I'm not sure if I should post another announcement here at that point, as it might be considered spamming? I could edit this post, but that doesn't notify people so it wouldn't do much. Can any mods weigh in on this?

Then i proced to contact Steam Support...

Meanwhile i was checking my bp (Cuz i think i was suspend because some protection about someone hijack my account) and see some Vintage Hats i trade early that day was missing, then proced to check the bp of the person who trade me and i see he get back that Vintage Hats:

This is the trade i see and did:

My BP Now:

Him BP Now:
http://www.tf2items.com/profiles/76561197991276565

So i think he trick Steam Support say i scammed him. 

I have a lot of reports of scammers on “Sourceop Scammer database”, so i think this is a payback for this guys.

I dont see this before, he only have 0.2 hours of TF2 playtime... Obviously this is a phantom account for trade stoled items. He is a Scammer. 

What reply Steam Support:

---
First Answer:
Thank you for contacting Steam Support.

We are investigating this issue further. As soon as we have more information, we will update your ticket.
---

---
Second:
Your account was disabled due to scamming or hijacking another user's account in Team Fortress 2. This violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement and /or Steam's Rules of Online Conduct.

Per the Steam Subscriber Agreement, we have disabled the account and any games contained in it. The account will not be reactivated. 

The Steam Subscriber Agreement can be found at:
http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/

In addition to violation of contract, said activities on the account may violate state and federal law. Valve reserves the right to refer the matter to the appropriate authorities.
---

I already negate that and i ask for more info or what suposedly i scammed or hack ...

How is posible Steam Support believe on some user with only 0.2 hours instand of my i have 1000 hours...

I post a new thread on Steam forums and was deleted... Why? I dont know. I see a lot of threads of that type and none is delete... Why mine is deleted?

If some one can trace this item history:

http://www.tf2items.com/item/666534511 (Earbuds LV45)

If you see this item was traded ""supposedly"" on date : January 20, 2012, 21:28:18 GMT from my account to a unknow account. 

This cant happen because i trade this item to this account: 

1. http://www.tf2items.com/profiles/76561197991276565 on date January 19 (For the Vintage Hats). 
2. My account was suspend on January 19. 

I apreciate the help you can give me guys or any other thing i can do...

**EDIT :**
Ok finally a clear answer about my suspend and some progress:
&gt;We have revised our decision and your account is now enabled, however your account was reported for actions relating to obtaining items from hijacked accounts. As a consequence, we have removed any stolen items/gifts from your account. You will not get any lost items/gifts back.
&gt;
&gt;Your trading privileges have been suspended permanently. We have a zero tolerance policy for scamming.

So this was because i trade the V. Hats for the buds from a Hjjacked account... 

In part is my fault because dont check the profile before of did the trade but this can happen to anyone. Now before we can make the trade we need: 1. Check Profile 2. Search on google if someone report 3. Finally do the trade..

1326754341.0,41,self.tf2trade,ojxm2,A quick refresh on safely trading cash. ,50,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ojxm2/a_quick_refresh_on_safely_trading_cash/,"Hey TF2trade, I posted the following in response to a post in r/TF2 asking how to safely trade for cash, and I thought you guys might benefit from it as well. Always good to keep yourself updated on how to safely trade.


--------------------------


Go to steam settings, look for a little thing that says ""show url bar in steam windows."" Activate that. 

First thing I do when trading someone is grab their steamID from their profile and paste it into steamrep.com. If it comes up clean, okay, but we're not clear yet.

I'll usually have a look at their profile next, check out their hours played - if it's below 200 i'm generally on medium alert, if it's below 100 you better be extra careful. If they only have TF2 installed and nothing else, that's another warning sign. 

If they have profile rep, disregard it. IT MEANS **NOTHING**. Seriously, it's completely worthless. The only reputation I accept is a reddit account with enough karma/long enough join date, or a SOP rep thread. Profile rep is extremely easily faked. 

Also, if they link you to a SOP rep thread and their profile looks the same, **check that you're actually dealing with the right person and not an impersonator.** To do this, just click on the SteamID in the SOP rep thread and check that you're added to the guys friends list, or check that the hours played match up with the person you're trading with. 

Middlemen, should you use one. If you have low rep and they won't go first, use a middleman. I barely ever go first unless i'm 100% sure I know  who i'm dealing with (i.e Mattie i'd happily go first with, and have in the past.) If they invite a middleman to the trade, ask for the middleman's rep thread and again, **VERIFY YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE CORRECT PERSON** I can not stress this enough, if you don't do that you're going to end up being scammed. 

Now onto paypal. It's fairly simple what you're able to do - Make sure it's sent as a gift. It'll say payment type ""Instant"" down at the bottom. If there's any crap about shipping details or anything unusual that you don't normally see, **refund it to him.** If it says the payment is not completed yet and will be in a few days, **refund it.** Do not take any risks with paypal. 

Unfortunately, they can still chargeback with a paypal gift, but to do so they must claim a fraudulent payment on their account. This is committing fraud and is illegal, but if you're dealing with someone who you think is a bit sketchy - ask them if their paypal is verified. Verified means that you have linked your bank account to your paypal account, and thus means claiming fraudulent payments is a lot more risky for them. Unverified means they've not got a credit card linked to their account, and can easily just claim fraudulent payment and take their money back with little repercussion. It will show you on the payment details page if the person is ""Non-US verified"" or ""Verified"". If you're ever unsure of a person and they don't have a verified account, don't do the trade. 


And the last thing i'd like to say:

If someone comes to you offering your buyout on a hat, or a ridiculous amount of cash, **don't do it.** Greed is the number one reason I see people getting scammed - they get offered $200 on their $100 hat and think they've hit the goldmine, when in reality it's just a scammer trying to fog their senses with greed. **If you are ever unsure of a trade, do not do it.**

Here's a few useful links:

Hope that helped, if you have any other questions just shoot. 

------

**An added tip from Mattie/thorax:**

Before doing a transaction over PayPal, ask them for the email address they'll be sending the money from (or that you'll send the money to). Log into PayPal and then paste this special little URL into the address bar:

https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_seal-entry&amp;pal=THEIR_EMAIL@ADDRESS.COM

Replacing the all-caps part with their email address. This will tell you 2 key things (1) the date they started their PayPal account and (2) whether they are Verified.

Both of these are useful bits of information to have because if it's too new or not Verified, you have more red flags.

Don't let greed cloud your judgement! Slow and steady and careful wins the race.

Neeed immediate help,45,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1ca0dj/pc_will_get_hijacked_neeed_immediate_help/,"Ignore the tag, I downloaded  a .rar file with supposedly ""screenshots"" and now steam closes randomly. My PC is corrupted, but it will take more time. How can I tell Valve that some1 is trying to hijack my steam ? I can still access it, but it closes randomly

**EDIT:**

How I proceeded after downloading the files:

- Tried to open them. they were 3 .scr files (screensaver). Nothing happened.

- Panicked. Opened Spybot Search &amp; Destroy shredder. Managed to shred one file. (This might have saved my account in the end). The others were already gone, or should I say ""unleashed"".

- It was a virus, not a trojan. My mouse began to move randomly at occasions, I got error messages saying ""Your valve account has been banned. Please check your mail."" Yes, it said 'Valve' account. ^ ^

The process itself was called [""Cookbook and Calendar setup""](http://imgur.com/4a0SYJ3) and was located in Windows' Temp files. Whenever I closed it, it relaunched. I couldn't delete other suspicious folders either.

- I tried to trade my earbuds and unus. away. Thanks IRL friends and Holy Crap, my non-IRL friend whom I could trust. 
Steam closed during this time and the trade window closed too. I had to open it up multiple times.

- Told my friends to reset my steam and mail accounts. Saved the most important files, lost all my music videos though (external HDD wouldn't work).

- Reinstalled Windows with the available option in windows 8. The apps reinstall automatically, but everything else is 
gone. Took the whole night.

- Turns out I forgot an earbud in my backpack. It's still there. Apart from that, I didn't lose anything, except a few keys I gave as a reward for my friend.

My hacker hijacked another trader's account, then began to post the links via that hacked account to multiple people, including me. I checked it before downloading, but of course I didn't find any steamrep scammer tag because the account itself is legit. [Natman](/user/Natman117) has taken control of his [account](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044119770) again (or so do I hope), the real scammer has yet to be confirmed. [This thread](http://forums.steamrep.com/threads/general-ragequit-hijacked-me.27381/#post-83219) deals with this issue. Thanks /u/SheeEttin for providing it. Natman has made [a similar reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1ca56u/my_account_was_hijacked_i_know_who_did_it_what/).


**TL;DR: Problem solved. Have my account back. I didn't check outpost though (might get marked). Thanks for your support. Hacker never got into my steam (forgotten earbud still there).
If I sent you this link via chat on steam, don't worry. My items are safe and I'd be glad to trade with you again after everything is solved.**

WARNING: WALL OF TEXT. SKIP TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU JUST WANT THE RAFFLE.

Hi everyone! (Look for how to enter the new raffle at the bottom of this thread, along with the re-picked winner of the previous raffle. Keep on reading for an explanation of the giveaway and how to enter.)

***Please help this get as much attention as possible. You know what to do! :3***

Remember me? I sure hope you do! I'm waylaidwanderer, known as ""[CTS] Phoenix"" on Steam. I'm the admin of the CTS community and its servers, a little community that started mostly with members of /r/tf2trade who have joined me on my servers (a full list of which may be found on my [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity)) and had tons of fun! However, for the past few months, it's been pretty much dead. Most people would connect, see an empty server... and then leave! :'( So what I've been trying to do is to liven up the place and get tons of people on it!

For the past week, starting last Monday, I did a raffle every day up to and including Sunday, all in an effort to fill up my servers with people. Each post has drawn a lot of attention, and with the tons of participants (and over 500 entries total), I managed to get more than 50 people to join my [Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity)! Not bad! However, my servers ***are still dead***! Yes, you heard that right. They've mostly been in the same state as before, with a few extra people due to the raffles. At most we've had ~10 people on my trade server, and that was only for less than half an hour!

So now, in a last ditch effort to put a spark back into almost lifeless community, I'm holding an EXTRA BIG MEGA GIVEAWAY! But this time, it comes with **conditions**. No more just typing a random entry phrase in the hopes of winning a free item in my raffles - this time, if you want the prizes, you're going to have to work for it! But not too hard!

---------------------------

###The Giveaway

All the rules and conditions are posted on the CTS community [&gt;&gt;&gt;forums thread&lt;&lt;&lt;](http://www.thectscommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?5-The-CTS-Community-s-first-BIG-giveaway!-Play-on-our-servers-for-a-chance-to-win-BIG!) (the forums are a new thing!), so feel free to head on over and make an account there! You don't even need to sign up - just log in with Steam and an account will be created for you! **To enter the giveaway, you must have an account on the [forums](http://www.thectscommunity.com/forums/forum.php).**

I've also included the rules here for ease-of-access:

**What:** Play at least ***FIFTEEN (15)*** hours and win BIG prizes!  
**When:** December 10th to midnight on December 31st  
**Where:** [Our trade servers](http://www.thectscommunity.com/stats/hlstats.php) (general trade server and unusual trade server)  

(That's ***less than an hour each day*** spent on the server from now until the end of December 31st!)

What are the prizes?

* **GRAND PRIZE #1: Strange Sapper** - show those pesky engies who's boss!
* **GRAND PRIZE #2: Salvaged Mann Co. Supply Crate #40** - treasure lurks within... keep it, unbox it, or sell it? It's up to you!
* **GRAND PRIZE #3: Bill's Hat (painted White)** - An ancient relic from a post-apocalyptic time. Wear it with pride!
* If we reach **50 eligible participants**, the general prize pool will be opened! That means all the donated items will be open for anyone to win! There are tons of awesome prizes too, so that means many many chances to win!
* If we reach **100 eligible participants**, a fourth GRAND PRIZE will be added! This means there are a total of four possible grand prize winners.

###Detailed rules:

* Breaking any of the in-game [rules which can be read on the forums](http://www.thectscommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?12-IMPORTANT-Basic-Server-Rules-follow-them!) is grounds for disqualification, at the discretion of our admins.
* Circumventing the AFK Manager, idling, or other methods of not contributing to the server will disqualify you.
* One entry (and one account) per person. Having the same IP logged on multiple accounts is grounds for disqualification with the exception of pre-approved cases of family members and roommates.
* You must have an account on our forums that's clearly linked to your in-game account.
* **Prize drawing will be done by randomly assigning entrants numbers, and then drawing the winners using RANDOM.ORG. It will probably be live-streamed and recorded for transparency, if necessary. You can vote for this in the forum thread!**
* Accumulating **15** hours of playtime on our servers will grant you one **(1)** entry to the Grand Prize Pool, and if the requirements are met, the General Prize Pool. The bonus entry described below provides up to one additional entry to the Grand Prize Pool only.
* Due to the nature of a trade server, this giveaway is opened to **premium players only**, so I am very sorry if you're free to play. However, you can still be eligible for the general prize pool if you have met the requirements!
* Your Steam account must have been created before December 10th, 2012.
* Additional rules may be added at the discretion of the organizers and admins at any time.

###Bonus Entries:

* First, you must fulfill the entry requirements through playing for 15 hours.
* By participating in the forum community and making at least 25 posts on our forums, you will get an additional entry into the Grand Prize section of the pool.
* Breaking our posting rules, spamming, and negatively contributing to discussions as determined by the discretion of our admins will disqualify your extra entry and may result in revoking your forum account and eligibility for the contest entirely.
* ***NEW***: By referring a friend, as long as he also meets the entry requirements, you will gain one (1) additional entry into the Grand Prize section of the pool, for a total of three (3) entries and tripling your individual chance to win.

###General Prize Pool Entries:

* As long as we have **50 eligible participants in the Grand Prize pool**, the **General Prize Pool** will be unlocked.
* By participating in the forum community and making at least 25 posts on our forums, you will get one **(1)** entry into the General Prize Pool. By making at least 50 posts on our forums, you will get one **(1) additional** entry into the **General Prize Pool**, for a total of two **(2)** entries and doubling your individual chance of winning a prize.
* Breaking our posting rules, spamming, and negatively contributing to discussions as determined by the discretion of our admins will disqualify your extra entry and may result in revoking your forum account and eligibility for the contest entirely.

###Support Us:

* Donations of items, keys or metal for the prize pool are happily accepted, and your will be credited with your donations in the information and prizes threads.

###Raffle

[Day 1/?: Just gotta keep on moving sometimes. No good staying in one place too long.]

Due to the last raffle's winner (Raffle 6/7) never claiming his prize and **not having flair so I couldn't contact him**, I had to pick a new winner.

***The last raffle's winner (6/7) is now /u/santana011, with his prize of a*** **Strange Part: Demomen Killed** ***, a*** **Strange Bottle** ***, a*** **Decal Tool** ***, and a*** **Dueling Mini-Game** ***PLUS a*** **Strange Shortstop** ***! Congratulations!  
Add me anytime you see this and claim your prize!***


***The previous raffle's winner (7/7) is /u/Arcanize, with his prize of a Strange Part: Soldiers Killed, a Strange Crusader's Crossbow, a Strange Direct Hit, a Strange Eyelander, a Frying Pan, and a Strange Part: Kills While Explosive Jumping! Congratulations!  
Add me anytime you see this and claim your prize!***

Today's prize up for grabs:

* A **Refined Metal** (donated by /u/evilphotosynthesis), a **Strange Persian Persuader**, and a **Strange Scottish Resistance** (both donated by /u/googanautgod)!

***Thank you for all the donations*** Many thanks to all your generosity, and Happy Holidays! Thanks for spreading the Smissmas cheer!
For /u/IIAmA who [donated](puu.sh/1zHFx.png) and requested a cat picture, [here you go](http://i.imgur.com/LUuWY.png)!

#####Here is an album of all the cat pictures I've done so far! [Link](http://imgur.com/a/3MUTf)

*How do you enter?*

Well, simple! All you have to do is comment and include the words ""Giveaways are cool and I should join your Steam group!"" (quotes not required) exactly how it's spelled, punctuated, written and capitalized. It's okay to write other things in your comment if you wish!

##PLEASE INCLUDE A LINK TO YOUR STEAM PROFILE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE FLAIR. If you are picked and do not have flair, another winner will be chosen.

**Upvotes** are not required but *will be appreciated*. :) I'd like this to get as much attention as possible!

And maybe join my [***Steam group***](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity)? That would be awesome!

Using [RedditRaffle](http://redditraffle.com/), a winner will be automatically chosen out of everyone on this thread who enters.

So good luck everyone (and join my [***Steam group***](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity), and submit your entry for the giveaway)!

Remember, the entry phrase for the raffle is ***""Giveaways are cool and I should join your Steam group!""*** (bold, italics and quotes not required but can be used)

You won't find the earbuds in my current account. They are in another alt of mine which contains just that. I made that account when my current account was banned by Steam due to account sharing (GO DOTA2). I stopped using that account once I reclaimed this. WHY am I keeping them on an alt?

I'm one of the mods from [/r/NewtoTF2](/r/NewtoTF2), and I'm setting up a glossary of terms for our users.  No one knows inventory and trading terms better than the folks at /r/TF2Trade, and I could use some help putting together the Inventory/Trading terms.  I have a very basic list of terms going already, but we could use some assistance getting a better list going.

Post either here, or over at the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/qnegn/newtotf2s_glossary_of_terms/).  Don't stress about posting something that has already been posted; I'll sort them and handle duplicates later.

The Armory has always helped two different groups of people: New players that needed weapons to get started, and veterans that needed to do 1:1 weapon swaps. We are now making both tasks easier by dedicating different accounts to each task.

[All the guidelines are detailed in the Reddit Armory steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditarmory)

We have also teamed up with the great people at /r/NewToTF2 to help new players reach us.

********************************************

Up until now, I've been the only person hopping into the Armory accounts. There have been times where I have been unable to login daily or even for extended periods of time due to my other TF2Trade moderation tasks, the other subreddits I moderate, or simply personal reasons. I'm now opening the Armory to trustable volunteers that want to help by hopping into the accounts.

If you think you can help volunteer your time, please reply to the comment I'll leave below. Keep in mind you would have to be available to hop in randomly multiple times a week.

PLEASE remember to only friend the accounts for active trades or donations. We have limited slots and we want to help as many people as possible.

I didnt get an unusual, but the other guy unboxing did. A scorching flames something. either way i had a lot of fun and gave away a couple of strange machinas, kritzs, and many other items. I will be posting before to long with a giveway thread, so keep your eyes peeled. Thanks again for taking part!

**EDIT:**  Looks were about 2 hours from the start of this thing. I will probably be dropping in periodically on the tf2trade server to have some fun and maybe do some smaller give aways (hats, weapons, etc). Also remember this is mainly about the uncrating tonight. I will be doing some give aways before and after, however the big give aways will come in the next couple of days. I will probably ask on here for some advice on them since they seemed to get a bit confusing on the Unusual Hat give away from before. I now have all the crates I need. Looks like I will be going in with **22** 30 crates to uncrate. The others will mostly consist of crate 1s, 19s, and 32-34s. 

Its that time again! Time to aimlessly waste 100 keys in a big back to back uncrating on one of the r/tf2 trade servers. I am going with the tf2trade.com server this time. I will be doing 100 crate live around 10 pm CST tomorrow evening (Saturday that is, and around 24 hours and 30 minutes after this post). 

Now as most of you know from when I have did this before (you would probably recognize my tf2 name as Kevin Spacey), you know this will be followed up within a day or so after with a huge give away/cheap sale on most of the uncrated items. I am excited to announce I currently have 19 crate number 30's (and looking for more) that will be included in this as well (some of these items will be given away as well). 

I am currently still looking for a few specific crates, so please look for my other post detailing what I'm after. 

Well guys, I just wanted to give the heads up and invite all to come watch all my dreams come true as i uncrate one of the burning TC's , as alot of people have asked for details of when this is going down. I have been trying to spread word of this on the servers the past few days as I've held small give aways each night (now totaling around 50 keys I have given over that period). 


Here is a group ~~ChatnNaked (lol just wanted to type that out)~~ (Actually noticed Oxynoak suggested this first) just noticed so I can post more details when the time gets closer. Feel free to join. I may use this for the giveaways as well. 

http://steamcommunity.com/groups/uncrateathon/
So please join me that night for the uncrating, some preliminary give aways, and more details on when the big give away will be. Hope to see you there.

* Please use tags in your title. [H] Have, [W] Want, [PC] Price-check. We know the the temptation is high to use a catchy title, but with dozens upon dozens of new posts made each day, keeping things  orderly makes scanning new posts easier for everyone.

* You need to have an idea of what your looking to get for your stuff. Vague ""want offers"" posts are just frustrating for everybody involved and either lead to no responses, or a post full of people shooting in the dark. They will be spam filtered as when we see them. The exception to the rule are Unusual Hats, which can be highly subjective. It's your responsibility to price-check your Unusual so you have a ballpark to aim for, and we suggest you qualify ""offers"" with ""want XX buds in value"".

* As it stands, trading for cash or items that do not fit in the Trade Window is not allowed. Posts asking for Paypal offers will be pulled.

* Lowballing, ripping uneducated people off, etc. is greasy stuff, but *not* considered scamming. We strive to be a fairly safe place for trading, and part of that is educating inexperienced traders. Please refrain from contacting mods/admins looking to get somebody banned because they offered you a couple of Strange Weapons for your unusual. Either educate them on values, or block them on Steam and never have to deal with them again. If somebody makes a post wildly over/under-valuing their item, make a comment, but don't crap in somebody's thread over a couple scrap.

* Posting your Steam ID without a working link is next to useless. People will have to comb Google and the Steam Community website, looking for IDs that are similar to yours, but may or may not be you.

Speaking of which, I'd also like to remind people that you can now put a link to your Steam Profile next to your username to facilitate trading. Here's how:

* Go to [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/) and enter your Profile Name.
* Find the line that begins with ""steamID64"". This is the URL you need. URLs containing your profile name will be rejected.
* Copy the URL and [send a message to BigFriendlyRobot](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=bigfriendlyrobot&amp;subject=tf2trade). Leave the subject line alone, paste the URL into the message, and hit ""Send"".
* You're good to go! It can take up to ten minutes for the bot to process your request, so please be patient.

I'm down 16 hats from last time, because I've been selling stuff like hot-cakes.  Probably because I lowered the prices on many hats since last time.  Lots of 2-Bud hats became 1.66 Buds.  Lots of 1.5-Bud hats became 1.33 Buds, and so on.  
  
---  

**RULES, NOTES, AND INFORMATION** (please read this through at least once)

---

1.  Prices are set in stone for the most part, but you can still offer if you really want.

2.  I *can* trade for other Unusuals, but **you must overpay with Unusuals.**  No free upgrades here!

3.  I have no interest in: *anything* besides **Buds**, **Keys**, and **$USD**.  Sorry, I don't have time to re-sell random stuff anymore :&lt;

4.  **All sales are final.**  I leave it to the buyer to do their own research.  Buyer's remorse is not my problem.

5.  Unusuals that have been ~~sold~~ will have their names ~~crossed out.~~

6.  **Do not add me unless you are paying the exact listed price in Buds/Keys/$USD.**

7.  For cash trades, I **only take Paypal/MoneyPak**.  None of that online gift card silliness.

8.  [**Here is my SourceOP Rep (click).**](http://forums.sourceop.com/threads/123164-Varren-s-Rep-Thread!)  You'll be going first unless you've got more rep than me.

9.  I reserve the right to not trade with anyone for any reason.

10.  If you have any questions, PM me and I can offer clarification.

---

**HOW I VALUE THINGS**

---

Currently, this is how I value things:

* 1 Bud = 27 Keys
* 1 Key = $1.35 USD

Hat prices in $USD are based on Keys.

---

**SCREENSHOTS**

---

They can ALL be found [here (click)](http://thegoddamnhatman.imgur.com/).

Pro-Tip: Use ""Ctrl+F"" to find the hat you want to see.

Every hat that has a visible album is for sale, unless I goofed up.

If you're more of a visual shopper, then you may want to just browse the screenshot galleries.

Please don't hate me :(


Recently the cost of server and bot hosting has risen dramatically. While we have been surviving on donations for a long time, it is now impractical to do so. However, rather than close down the subreddit and all the features you've come to know and love, we have decided to make the subreddit open to all who donate one key a month.

_____________________________

With the recent addition of our Donation Bot, donating has never been easier! Simply follow these steps, and you're on your way to keeping /r/tf2trade around for a long time.

________

1.  Add our bot via his [profile](http://i.imgur.com/o4WdHCE.png) or this link [here](steam://friends/add/76561198075186001)
2. [Send our bot a trade!](http://i.imgur.com/407DVxw.png) He will accept if he is not currently trading someone else
3. Sometimes the trade will encounter [an error,](http://i.imgur.com/iattPRI.png) be patient and try again
4. After successfully entering a trade, [add keys or metal](http://i.imgur.com/vul3ZxD.png) to pay for your subscription. 4 ref = 1 key and 1 key = 1 month!
5. The bot will tell you [how long](http://i.imgur.com/R2Tncel.png) you have subcribed for!
6. The bot will then automatically [delete you](http://i.imgur.com/dFG5AQi.png), add him again if you wish to add more time!

_________

Thank you for your understanding and we hope to see you for many years to come.

__________

FAQ
___________
&gt;**Can I donate other items?**
&gt;&gt;No. For now, you can only donate keys and metal. In the future when the prices of items becomes more stable we will consider accepting other TF2 items.

__________

&gt;**What if I encounter an error?**
&gt;&gt;As this technology is new, we are bound to encounter an error now and again. Please be patient and stay calm. The bot will first try to verify your identity. If this fails please leave a comment on this post and we will get to you as soon as we can.

_______

&gt;**Will /r/tf2trade ever be free again?**
&gt;&gt;As this is a pilot program, we cannot be too sure. We will see how many donations come in and decide based on those figures. If we do not reach our target quota of donations we will, sadly, have to close the subreddit. At this point, even one refined could make the difference between making us, and breaking us.

__________

&gt;**What will happen if I do not donate?**
&gt;&gt;On April 2nd those who have not donated will temporarily lose their flair until they donate sufficient funds to be resubscribed to the subreddit.

_________

&gt;**I don't have enough funds to donate! What do I do?**
&gt;&gt;It is understandable that some newer traders will not have the ability to pay a key every month to use the subreddit. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the funds to support the large number of newer traders that exist in the TF2 userbase.

___________

&gt;**Who wrote this sexy bot?**
&gt;&gt;None other than the steamy /u/drkabob!

1357933790.0,43,self.tf2trade,16e8yp,[Q] Why do random mean Russians keep adding me about trades? I'm not kidding...,50,7,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/16e8yp/q_why_do_random_mean_russians_keep_adding_me/,"In the past few days I've been getting almost 2 friend requests every hour from random Russian people asking if I'm selling hats. I've never posted anywhere that I'm selling hats so why would people even think this? The thing that is weird about this is I haven't posted my steam name anywhere besides reddit in 3 weeks (outpost). And yes, every single person who has added me is Russian, and very mean. 

So my question here is really why this could be happening so suddenly, why me, and has this happened to anyone else. I usually ask them how they got my steam name and they all say is ""From Team Fortress 2"". And if I ask them to elaborate they never respond. 

Edit: Actually one of I'd say the 20ish was very nice. He was very polite and reasonable but the others are all mean. 

The weirdest one was about the 4th guy who added me and when I said hello he replied ""I'm not going to buy any of ur fuckin hats"". So he added me just to tell me that he didn't want to buy any of the hats that I wasn't even selling in the first place. wat

Edit: Baggses might be right that they're all after my uncraftable football helmet that I have open on outpost from 3 weeks ago. Still doesn't explain why no one has even asked for it, why they're all Russian, and why they were so mean if they wanted something from me.

Be aware, we are not changing the rules itself. Nether camping is still not allowed, we just now have a way to define it. Technically, Mehberry has already started enforcing these ""mini-rules"", I just wanted to get the word out.

_____

**Nether Camping:**

--------

AS OF JUNE 26TH, THE NETHER SPAWN IS A NO-KILL ZONE. NO EXCEPTIONS. KILLING OTHERS INSIDE THE NETHER SPAWN OR BAITING OTHERS TO KILL YOU IS ALSO PART OF THIS OFFENSE.

____

_When it is camping:_

* Blocking the entrance in anyway

If you put a dispenser, yourself, or other thing directly where people spawn, you are officially camping.

_Allowed/Not allowed:_

* No sentries in the Nether spawn at all.

Clickers are not allowed under this rule (in the spawn).

* Sentries in Nether outside of spawn are allowed, no restrictions.

This means they can be everywhere in the Nether (excluding the spawn). 

* Players can kill if stuck by other players.

This was allowed before. Don't stand near the spawn.

* Players can kill in spawn.

I know that I personally have enforced a no-kill zone in spawn, but that has changed. You may kill in spawn, granted you do not break the rules given in this post.

* Groups of 4+ are not allowed to kill.

This affects the Nether spawn only. Outside groups of 4+ is allowed.

---------------------

This is different than the previous ""rule"" as it was just a general ""don't do it"". 

Mehberry has made a spray that usually goes in the Nether spawn anyways, but for all of you regulars, here's the update.

Just because you don't agree with someones trade prices or asking  doesn't mean you should be down voting them.

I have been looking through trades and seen legit offers being down voted, some heavily.

So what's going on? Are people so cheap here that they down vote anything they cannot afford out of spite, or that they down vote because it's not what *they* want to pay?

Help me out here guys, because it's getting out of control.

*edit:* Point in case. This post is already being down voted.

**Out of almost 200 entrants yesterday, a whoppin'** ***SIX*** **of you joined my group! Thanks!**

**I will not take less than buyout price for any of these hats!**

New hats and prices will have their names **bolded.**

I can take 27 Keys in place of a Buds.  Thus 0.33 Buds = 9 Keys = TS/VoT Bill's.

If you make an offer with one or more of your own unusuals, they will be valued at quicksell price.  No exceptions.

**I can take Paypal as long as you go first and pay all the fees.  And you agree that 1 Buds = $33.**

**If you want to pay the buyout on any of these items, add me right away for a fast trade!**

1347914742.0,40,self.tf2trade,101hsm,[Q] Anyone noticing oddities with backpack.tf price changes?,44,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/101hsm/q_anyone_noticing_oddities_with_backpacktf_price/,"I've started using backpack.tf as a pricing resource a lot lately but over the past few days I'm wondering why they are deciding to accept/deny price changes.  Here's two quick examples that leave me scratching my head.

Yesterday someone proposed a price drop of the [Strange Shotgun](http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5055ea279ae21a6207000000) from 2.88 ref to 2.55 ref.  A total of 23 people voted on it and the vote was split at 13 for and 10 against or +3 (not even enough to show the total votes in overview) yet the price was accepted and changed relatively quickly.  I don't think there was nearly enough evidence provided to warrant a switch, especially not with a vote that even.

Last week someone voted to drop the price of the Genuine Quadwrangler from 10 to 9 ref and it passed.  Yesterday someone proposed [a price revert](http://backpack.tf/vote/id/50569ffc9ae21a4c70000000) as evidence suggested that they were still selling strongly at 10 ref.  With the vote sitting at 45 for and 6 against or +39 the suggestion is suddenly closed.

I'm not suggestion that there is some sort of behind the scenes price fixing or anything but I know the creator of backpack.tf has posted on here a few times and I'm just trying to get some clarification as to the methodology of approving/rejecting a pricing suggestion.",,False,,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,t3_101hsm,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/101hsm/q_anyone_noticing_oddities_with_backpacktf_price/,

1329510701.0,40,self.tf2trade,puc5b,[PSA] Steam trading for games is still very risky. Here's a way to protect yourselves a bit more if you decide to do so.,45,5,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/puc5b/psa_steam_trading_for_games_is_still_very_risky/,"Remember that fraudulent purchases are very common, and that any game you get in a trade may not have been originally purchased by the person trading it to you, but from someone more dishonest. Always ask!

Steam does try to help people that get affected by such game copies:

https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003

&gt; **What if a game I received in a trade is fraudulently purchased?**


&gt; If this happens, the account where the fraud took place will be suspended. Your account will not be suspended, however the game you received will be removed from your account. We will restore the items/gifts that were associated with the trade back to you. **If you did not trade any items/gifts for the game directly then we are not able to restore anything to your account.**


I'm highlighting the last part, since I was a victim that lost games because of this. One copy of Skyrim, for example, was gifted to a friend for his birthday (he obviously didn't give me anything for it). The game was revoked, and Steam couldn't/wouldn't restore anything to *me*.

**********************


This would have been avoided the following way:

Never trade for a game without giving something back for it. **NEVER**.

* Before gifting the game, give the receiver something of similar value (in my case, a pair of buds and a Bill's would have been enough for Skyrim).

* Trade the copy of the game for the items. 

This way, Steam now has a record of items being exchanged. It sounds unnecessarily tedious, but will help you avoid a headache.



If you are buying games while paying with cash, this is especially important. [**Remember that Steam is against selling Steam gifts for money**](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?p_faqid=549#sellgifts), threatening to even suspend the accounts of those selling games. While they may not enforce this much, if a sold game is revoked, you're basically on your own.

Since all cash sales **should** involve middlemen, you should do something like this:

* The game seller sends the game to the middleman.

* You, as the buyer, give the middleman items or games of the same value of the game to the middleman for the game in the same trade session.

* When the payment is done, and the items are returned to you.


This way, if the game IS revoked, you will get those items you traded with back. If the buyer doesn't have items to trade with, you can work something out with the seller and middleman to protect yourself in a similar way. 

******************************

The best way not to get scammed trading for games is to only buy from trustworthy traders that bought the games themselves.

**TL;DR** Never trade Steam games without having something on the other side of the trade window of the same value, or you won't get anything if it's revoked. Even if it's a gift or a Paypal sale.",,False,,t5_2s0s4,False,,trusted hat donor,True,t3_puc5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/puc5b/psa_steam_trading_for_games_is_still_very_risky/,moderator

Post trades on reddit or outpost or other websites asking for offers on your low craft number. If your low craft number is over 10, I doubt it will go for over 1.5 buds as the low craft market has crashed. 

**There is no set price for these items as they are one of a kind.** Your hat/misc is worth what some collector out there is willing to pay for it. Bump your trades as many times as possible to increase exposure and increase the chance that someone interested will see it.

I have also increased the base price of keys in metal to reflect recent prices increases. As always, you can easily change these values to anything you see fit.

Big thanks to [HattensHatClub](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/HattensHatClub) and [Hattencrap](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041886106) for hosting this cross-community tournament. 

This is how it will go down. I will turn our trade servers into tournament servers. The three winners from our servers will move on to the finals and fight it out for a Bill's Hat! (or the other three prizes mentioned in the video!) So there will either be 64 or 94 players at once inside the three servers. I'm not sure yet if we will dedicated two or three servers. This will be dependent on how many people are actually interested in this sort of thing. If you are indeed interested, leave a comment below showing you would like to see this happen!

More details will be released as we get closer to the tournament date. Keep your eyes out!

I posted [this appeal](http://unusualtradingcommunity.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=6179) on the UTC forums. Not because I was hunted down, but because I brought the issue to the attention of Atom. I've always prided myself on being a fair trader, helping out newer members of the community, and overall, trying to be a positive influence. I've helped people sell Max Heads for charity, worked on organizing a free TF2 league for reddit, (Scalia can tell you how well that went...) and stay an active member of the trading community.

I brought up the ban with Atom because I wanted to see if there was anything that could be done about getting the scammed person the items they deserved. As expected, that wasn't possible, but to my horror, I was informed that I would now have to argue a case against the ban being moved to my account. Aren't the point of SteamRep bans to warn against harmful traders? I've had multiple opportunities to steal hundreds of dollars in stuff, and always, always, ended up helping out for free with no strings attached. Am I really a threat of some kind, one that needs to be publicly defaced?

Do you guys have any suggestions of what to do? I felt you guys would understand more than anyone else how this can be something more than a simple hobby, something that you pride yourself in, and to get labeled a scammer, over something a friend did, on a different account, a half year ago, without my knowledge, that I then brought up in an attempt to rectify would be such a big deal.""

tl;dr: I noticed there was a ban on my alt, which I let a friend use, from half a year ago for running on a spycrab. Asked if there was someway to get the rightful stuff to the owner, got banned instead, all in less than half a day.

They want me to explain my relationship to a specific account which I have never heard of before. I replied with that, and they responded with me having recently completed a trade with the person and that they claimed their account as hijacked while the trade was completed.

The first thign I did was check my inventory trading history to see where that name comes up. It doesn't, I only have a few trades with people since its my main account and I hardly do any trading on it. I leave most trading for my trading account, yet that's not the one being blocked right now.

- I can't find this mysterious person.. apparently I need to explain my relationship to the account ""neddlepoint"" yet I have tried every way possible to find whoever this is and see if it comes back to my memory but nothing....

Only thing I can think of is before being blocked I did alot of steam market buying/selling... what if I purchased hijacked items from an account... ? I have no idea how that would work.. but I am honestly lost.


Any help please? 

**Edit:** Thank you so much for all the help. I have responded back to steam support yet again stating I still have no idea about this account they claim I have a relation with.

* You can pay in metal, but you must overpay by 1 scrap*.

* Your low-tier or cancer strange plus a scrap for mine, you choose

* If yours is worth .22 more than mine, then the swap is free

* If you have a strange that I don't have in stock, the swap is only 1 weapon!

So I finally got around to realising my fundraising for my school (annoying, considering I had 3 different currency balances at the start in paypal, other payments from the same paypal, stock of my own I sold...bleh) and **I calculated my earnings for the school fundraiser to be £200.34 ($317.25~).**

A lot of the sales have been on here from a number of stores. I've literally sold hundreds of items on here in the past few weeks. To show my thanks, I'm raffling off a couple of the remaining bits of stock (I did take these into account; it's going from my generosity).

Prize pool (**there will be ~~7~~ lots of winners!**):  
1) Grimme Hatte.   
2) Exquisite Rack, painted 216.    
3) Vintage Stockbrokers Scarf.  

Also some smaller prizes:

6) S. Diamondback + S. Overdose pack.  
7) S. Diamondback + S. Backscratcher pack.

13) S. Dead Ringer + S. Quickfix

I was able to get a few of the bugs fixed and have started working on improvements (I'll launch those soon), but I also released something new.

I created a ""Price Calculator"". Yeah, I know there are many out there, but none of them worked how I wanted them to. This one is simple, you can either select buds or keys, then you type in the amount. 

For example; You put in 2.55 keys and it tells you that's 2 keys, 2 ref, 2 rec, 1 scrap, and 1 weapon.

The price from keys and buds are automatically pulled in from backpack.tf, but I also give you the ability to edit those prices. If you only value keys at 5 ref, you can manually adjust that.

Metal and key numbers are taken from stats.tf, key prices taken from tf2finance.com.  Knowing that, what's important is not the exact numbers but the overall trends.

****

**Finds**

* Keys increase in price roughly 1.5 scrap per week.
* Number of keys has come back up significantly.
* Key price correlates more to the amount of metal and not really to the amount of keys.
* Ratio of keys to metal has been pretty steady for about 2 weeks.

****

So this suggests some possible solutions to rising key prices.  The obvious is to address the increase in amount of metal.  Drop rate could be altered, Valve could do a ""Craft Day/Week/Month"" and make hats craftable for 2 ref (or perhaps permanently), ....that's all I got off the top of my head.  And though this is only 1 month of data, based on the trends I do not believe keys will come down by sheer force of traders; it will have to come from Valve.

**EDIT:**  Ok, I know some of you are pissed but here's what happened.  We lost FTP access first thing this morning and that means our ability to modify configs and enable/disable plugins was screwed.  When the event was about to start Magicalkillacow's reserved slot wasn't working and we couldn't fix it.  Our only option was to temporarily set a password to get him in.  I know this threw a lot of you out after waiting all day but it couldn't be avoided and I apologize.  Once the event got rolling, we kicked anyone who won but allowed them a chance to rejoin and that's the best we could do.  Please understand that there were people from all over North America and Europe trying to get in and we only had 32 slots to work with.  We did our best under the circumstances.  I'm sorry things weren't ideal.

**EDIT2:** Understand that we lost access to our FTP at about 6 this morning.  We still had plugins to disable and configs to adjust and we couldn't do any of it.  We contacted support and they ultimately said that they'd have to take the server down to fix it and didn't know how long it would take.  This was around noon and the server was already full so we decided to roll with what we had.  We got off to a really shakey start but thanks to Destructo, we got things rolling and carried out what we said we were going to do.  There are only 32 players that can be on at any time and there are *THOUSANDS* of you.  I'm sorry if you got kicked unjustly but the event was already being streamed and we had to  make it happen.

I like to spread some joy in the festive season leading up to Christmas.

I'm wearing my Santa Stockings tonight and would like to gift a few of you some Team Fortress 2 items. 

I'll select people randomly, add them and gift them a item from my inventory.

It can be anything from a craft hat to a few unwanted Stranges I've to something a bit more expensive. My goodie bag is quiet huge, so there's something for everyone.

A few things to keep in mind 

* You mustn't be flithy rich and come here asking for gifts. 
* People who're relatively new to this game or don't have much to spend or buy takes priority.

Although, I'll choose randomly, here's how you can increase your chances of being sent a friend request.

* Posting a funny comment
* Posting a funny TF2 related video/image
* Being awesome in general.

So, good luck and post below if you're feeling lucky tonight :)

Cheers!

Check out the new raffle - the prize is a Genuine Neon Annihilator!

-------------------

Hey /r/tf2trade, it's time for another raffle! The last one was super-popular which made me really happy, so I'd like to make another raffle to thank you guys. This will be the first of two raffles.

Yet again, I would like to brazenly say that the sole purpose of this raffle is to promote my servers, and the prize up for grabs in this **24 hour** shindig is ***The Soviet Gentleman***, kindly donated by fellow tf2trader /u/kahafb!

Let's list the rules of this little raffle first (powered by redditraffle.com) before I go on my spiel (again).

To enter this raffle, you must:

* Have a Reddit account **at least** a week old
* Have flair (**Non-negotiable, folks. Sorry! No flair, no entry!**)
* Include the word ""spah"" in your comment - don't combine it with other words though (**SUPER IMPORTANT!**)
* Upvote this post (well, it's not actually required in any way whatsoever, but if you feel it's deserved, feel free!)

And that's it for the rules! Everyone has an equal chance to win!

--------------------------------

***Now onto the purpose of this raffle...***

I run 3 servers (trade, MvM, vanilla maps), and it's my dream to see them grow popular and have lots of people play on them. From my previous efforts, I've managed to be able to see a little community grow, but I'd love to see it grow even more.

So what I'd like *you* to do is to check out my servers! Favourite them, play on them often, and help me fill them! 

Sometimes you'll join my servers and find them empty! But that's okay! You simply need to invite some friends, tell them to invite your friends, and before you know it, it'll be full! Running these servers is a **team effort**, mentlegen, and I'm proud to have you as part of my team.

My servers are run with a simple philosophy: **community**. I like to foster an environment where everyone can chill and have a good time, and I watch over them to help it happen. So play on my servers, make friends, and have fun!

Would you like to help out? Join my [***new*** Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity) and read about how you can contribute to the CTS community! The reason this Steam group is new is because I felt the old name was, well, old and represented the infancy of the CTS servers. Now it's growing up, and getting bigger, and thus it needed a new name: The CTS Community.

Check out the CTS commmunity's [sexy new website](http://www.thectscommunity.com/) where you can read about the CTS, see how many users are currently playing, or the [CTS SourceBan's](http://www.thectscommunity.com/sourcebans/) page, which serves the same purpose essentially. The CTS also uses [HLStatsX](http://www.thectscommunity.com/stats/hlstats.php) so you can keep track of your kills and stuff. Visit the page [here](http://www.thectscommunity.com/stats/hlstats.php) and type ""hlx"" in game to check out your ranking!

Also, the CTS community also has a [forum](http://www.thectscommunity.com/forums/) which I'm hoping to get started. It's a ghost town right now and boasts a total of 2 members (including me :c). There are sections for general discussion, discussions about all things TF2, and a section for posting trades as well. Register there and introduce yourself, and I'll do my best to make you feel welcome! I hope to be able to hold private CTS-exclusive raffles and contests there one day once it gets popular enough.

Or you can just **hop right in** and join any of my 3 servers! Simply click the IP to join if Steam is running!

There have been widespread reports of issues with the item server in the last hour (as of 7 PM CDT, midnight UTC on 8/19/12). The problem specifically is that the game has been thinking people are F2P when they're not. As such, premium players that are affected are unable to trade.

As such, if you're affected, trading is practically impossible. Due to the widespread nature of this issue, it's best to wait for Valve to do something.

Some reports have come in that people have lost items due to this. Due to the unconfirmed nature of this, this is currently not a particularly dangerous situation at the moment.

The issue at hand, in a nutshell: **I** (apparently) **dun goofed.**

My plan was this:

1. Go purchase a Visa Gift Card.

2. Add the funds from it to PayPal.

3. ???

4. Keys for days.

The problem came around step 2.

Apparently, according to the multiple support threads I've looked up that contained negatory answers, PayPal can't verify the address linked to the card, meaning it can't be used or linked to the PayPal account. I've seen a few conflicting answers on the matter.

As a note, I have activated the card and registered the zip on it, same as the address I've put into PayPal for it.

So, it's questions time, round dos. This time with no crazy letter/number combo because srs bsns.

**1.** Is there a way to add this card to PayPal? If so, how?

**2.** Are there any alternate ways I could pay a seller? Ones that don't involve PayPal?

Due to the last posting for scammer reports getting unweildly, I started a new one.



**[Common scams are listed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jhyte/common_trade_scams_and_how_to_avoid_them/)**

Misrepresentation Scams: If someone represents something one way and it turns out not to be that way, that is a misrepresentation that amounts to scamming. In legalese, the ""risk of loss"" is on the buyer. However, the buyer must reasonably inquire to find out what they are purchasing. If they do not, then it is not scamming if they did not get what they thought they were getting for failure to ask.

**Examples**

1. Bill says his hat is worth 4 refined. It is worth 2. Jim does not research the hat, but buys it. He finds out later it is worth 2 refined. This is **not a scam** because Jim had a duty to find out what the price was before purchasing.

2. Bill says his hat is craftable. The trade window does show whether or not a hat is craftable. There is no way to determine whether a hat is craftable or not other than the seller's word. Jim buys the hat and then finds out it is, in fact, not craftable. This **is a scam** because Bill misrepresented his hat as being craftable when it was not.



***
To report anyone for scamming, [GO HERE and include the following information in the comments section](http://bans.tf2trade.com/index.php?p=submit)

1. ALL of the scammer's steam IDs as identified by [SteamRep](http://www.steamrep.com)

2. The victim's Steam ID

3. **Evidence in the form of screen shots or other trustworthy forms**

4. Witnesses, if any

5. The items that were scammed

I'm giving them away to needy nublets. 
 
Let me reiterate, these are NOT CRAFTABLE. Don't think you can make some new account and be all like ""please mister, can I have some sandvich?"" trying to make scrap out of it. And since valve marks craftable items properly now in trade, you'll be hard pressed to trade them. Please, just leave these items for the needy.
 
That said, here's what I have. I'll try to keep this updated, but since I'm being charitable I have little incentive to give a fuck about being tidy.

**UPDATE**: I'm going to bed. I'm on east coast and have to work early as hell tomorrow. If anyone sees anything from the few items remaining, please send me a PM and ask me to reserve it for you; tomorrow (Monday) I intend to try to donate the remains to the Reddit Armory. 

Thanks to everyone that helped in donating, and I hope everyone that got some weapons gets to rack up some kills with them.

Hey /r/tf2trade, here's raffle 2 of 2! The stakes have been raised, *hard* - up for grabs this time is a ***Genuine Neon Annihilator***, also donated by fellow Redditor /u/kahafb! This raffle will run for **24 hours**.

Yet again, I would like to brazenly say that the sole purpose of this raffle is to promote my servers. Please read everything - it would make me very happy!

Let's list the rules of this little raffle first (powered by redditraffle.com) before I go on my spiel (again).

To enter this raffle, you must:

* Have a Reddit account **at least** a week old
* Have flair (**Non-negotiable, folks. Sorry! No flair, no entry!**)
* Include the entry word in your comment, which can be found in my [&gt;&gt;&gt;Steam Group&lt;&lt;&lt;](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity) - don't combine it with other words though (**SUPER IMPORTANT!**)
* Upvote this post (well, it's not actually required in any way whatsoever, but if you feel it's deserved, feel free!)

As a side note, please join my group while you're looking for the entry word (hint: scroll down)! The reason I'm doing these raffles to promote my servers, and yesterday a grand total of **3** more people joined... so that's why I'm changing it up a little :)

And that's it for the rules! Everyone has an equal chance to win!

--------------------------------

***Now onto the purpose of this raffle...***

I run 3 servers (trade, MvM, vanilla maps), and it's my dream to see them grow popular and have lots of people play on them. From my previous efforts, I've managed to be able to see a little community grow, but I'd love to see it grow even more.

So what I'd like *YOU* to do is to check out my servers! Favourite them, play on them often, and help me fill them! 

Sometimes you'll join my servers and find them *empty*! But that's okay! You simply need to invite some friends, tell them to invite your friends, and before you know it, it'll be full!  
Running these servers is a **team effort**, mentlegen, and I'm proud to have you as part of my team.

My servers are run with a simple philosophy: **community**. I like to foster an environment where everyone can chill and have a good time, and I watch over them to help it happen. So play on my servers, make friends, and have fun!

Would you like to help out? Join my [***new*** STEAM GROUP](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity) and read about how you can contribute to the CTS community!  
The reason this Steam group is new is because I felt the old name was, well, old and represented the infancy of the CTS servers. Now it's growing up, and getting bigger, and thus it needed a new name: The CTS Community.

Check out the CTS commmunity's [SEXY NEW WEBSITE](http://www.thectscommunity.com/) where you can read about the CTS, see how many users are currently playing, or the [CTS SourceBan's](http://www.thectscommunity.com/sourcebans/) page, which serves the same purpose essentially. The CTS also uses [HLStatsX](http://www.thectscommunity.com/stats/hlstats.php) so you can keep track of your kills and stuff. Visit the page [here](http://www.thectscommunity.com/stats/hlstats.php) and type ""hlx"" in game to check out your ranking!

Also, the CTS community also has a [&gt;&gt;&gt;FORUM&lt;&lt;&lt;](http://www.thectscommunity.com/forums/) which I'm hoping to get started. **Please join!**  
It's a ghost town right now and boasts a total of 4 members (including me :c). There are sections for general discussion, discussions about all things TF2, and a section for posting trades as well. Register there and introduce yourself, and I'll do my best to make you feel welcome! I hope to be able to hold private CTS-exclusive raffles and contests there one day once it gets popular enough.

Or you can just **hop right in** and join any of my 3 servers! Simply click the IP to join if Steam is running!

/r/tf2trade is currently the fairest place to trade by far, but the problem is matching buyers with sellers.  It's about right place/right time, because posts only hours old fall down the list, and not everybody searches whenever they want something.  Outpost is ""I'll buy everything you have for half price"" spam, and tf2 metal market gets close, but it drives me crazy seeing people with the same buy/sell price listed, but without a transaction happening.  I would like to expedite the process by making the matching automatic, where you can click a little button and it will send you to a trade within a trivial amount of metal of your current price, and if you accept the price a friend request will be sent and the trade will continue.  Online players will take a priority over offline players.  You will still be able to browse new trades should you want to, current-sites style.

___

**What I will use:**

So, I believe I will be hosting with blogspot (because it's free) and using google's arsenal (because it's also free).  The plan is to AUTOMATICALLY hook up buyers/sellers WITHOUT WHOLESALE/BUY SPAM.  I don't want another outpost clone, I want a place for people to buy/sell at fair, middle-ground prices that don't result in a significant gain of wealth for one party or another.  No more buying all stranges for a scrap.  Fair market buyers and fair market sellers.

___


**How it's going to work:**

I'd like to have 2 sections, one for item&gt;metal/promos and vice versa, and another for item to item.  I'm still working out what will decide a fair trade or not, but it will most likely be a range based on backpack.tf's listed prices, which won't allow you to lowball if you are buying or highball if you are selling.  If you want to pay more/sell for cheap, I don't want to stop you.  The items are trickier, I'm thinking it would probably work like the metal trades, where the values of the items would have to be similar in order for a trade to be valid.  You would be allowed to wholesell/buy, however the profit margin would be fair.  Buying revolvers at .33 and selling at .66 is acceptable in my book, however .22/11 &gt; 1 ref clogging my screen 24/7 is not.

___
**What I need:** (WILL UPDATE)

* Somebody to help with the layout, design, code, etc.  My experience is limited, I need somebody who knows what's up.

* Community feedback.  If you guys don't want this, tell me.  If you do, tell me as well.

___

If you have web design experience and have ample free time (I have too much time on my hands, and I'm willing to spend some of it keeping something useful running, I would like you to be able to do the same), PM me or comment.  I would prefer if you are free between 8-12 PM MST (GMT - 7) weekdays, and within 3-4 hours of MST so that weekends can be made most useful.  If I get good feedback and suggestions, I will have an outline and potential visual mock-up ready should you want one within 24 hours.  So /r/tf2trade, would you like to see this become real?

###PSA and Raffle #5 - The final raffle!

------------------------------------------------------------

For those who missed the announcement yesterday, here it is again! Today is the **final raffle** before tomorrow's event! Yesterday, I announced the competitors in this tournament - again, congratulations for all who got in, and for those who didn't, don't worry! Feel free to come by and watch on Saturday! I will be enabling SourceTV on my server, so feel free to come and spectate, everybody.

---------------------

You may know me from [an announcement I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ws4ye/psa_come_join_the_community_trade_server_where/) last week about setting up a new trade server, focusing on trading with a sense of community.

It hasn't been that popular, but it has gotten a fair amount of people occasionally. So I got to thinking, ""how can I help make my trade server more popular, and have more people join, and hopefully come back regularly?"" 

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, I decided to organize an event, hosted on my trade server, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His partner?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday, 12 PM PST (noon)**, I will be hosting an epic battle on my server! I call it: ""The Huntsman and the Spy"". 

---------------------------------

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers, and 7 spies.

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map, but spies are allowed.

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!), and the goal of each sniper will be to use their Huntsman to take out enemy snipers on the other side of the map. Your spy partner can either hang around you to protect you from enemy spies, or they can choose to sneak their way across the map and backstab enemy snipers. 

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats, until there are 3 semi-finalist teams on Red and Blu. 

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, the last team standing on Red or Blu will move to the final round. In the second round, the semi-finalists must keep battling until there is a winner on the team that did not win the first time (e.g. If a team on Blu won the first time, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round, the two teams must go head to head with each other. Sniper vs sniper, with both spies trying to protect their sniper and take out the other sniper and spy. The first sniper to die will cause their team to lose.

**EDIT: CLARIFICATION OF SOME RULES. If your Spy partner dies, you as a Sniper may continue playing, and if you as a Sniper dies first, your Spy partner may continue playing until both of you are eliminated. No respawning allowed!**

And that's it for the rules!

-------------------------------------------------

###THE GRAND PRIZES ARE: For the champion Sniper, he receives a Team Spirit painted Genuine Anger and a strange Sniper Rifle! For his faithful parter, a non-genuine Dashin' Hashshashin and a non-genuine Sharp Dresser!

As stated before, there will also be prizes each round for the teams that come out on top. **Redditors, if you are interested in donating a few items, be they weapons, miscs or hats, please do so! They will go into the prize pool! Also, as a for-profit trader, it'll make me feel better after giving away so many prizes... haha.**

1333947442.0,35,self.tf2trade,s0cvl,[Information] Sharking and What to Avoid,42,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/s0cvl/information_sharking_and_what_to_avoid/,"Hello folks, it's been a couple weeks since I've posted here (Except that super raffle that I created). However, some more disturbing information has leaked out about a few big name traders around the community and I thought I should at the very least remind everybody about sharking and what to look out for. 


Sharking, basically, is the act of offering somebody that you know has a valuable item (an unusual, a promo item, a rare vintage) something far less valuable. These people prey on low-hour players, freshly unboxed unusuals, and I hate to say it, but a lot of the times Redditors. 


To all those reading this, if you do every have the great fortune of unboxing an unusual, I advise you ask for a price check before doing -anything- at all with your hat. I can almost guarantee you that with the new unusual searches floating around, your unbox will appear to every shark within a day or so, and you will have a lot of friend requests. This is a hassle, but unfortunately it's bound to happen. Simply ignore them or say no thanks, because more often than not they're simply trying to scam you out of your hard-earned shiny purple hats!


I have myself been doing an investigation of a fellow named Anubis and/or Tangled, who has sharked well over 100 max sets, rare vintage items, buds, bills, and unusuals with his own personal search engine. He has made thousands of dollars off of people just like us, people that were unaware of the true value of their items. This type of behavior has become widespread within the community, and it's up to us all to keep ourselves informed, and help out our fellow Redditors. If you have any questions or concerns, I'd be more than happy to help each and every one of you out. Please add me via flair, or by going here:

I found it odd in the part I didn't screenshot that he started asking for my real name, which was public information to him already since it was in the paypal payment he sent to me, so I didn't think there was any harm in him knowing it.

He spent the first 20 minutes social enginering me. I thought he was about to buy another hat saying he was getting more keys and then he pops out with the ""GOTCH YA!"" scam statement.

I've taken advantage of it occasionally (one such trade actually got me started in the unusual 'business', to which I've made $375 from $5), much to the dismay of the ""redditors are better than the regulars!"" mentality we like to display here.

But, I decided to stop, and make up for it by making this PSA (public service announcement). 

**NEVER, EVER trust the person you're trading with to give you prices. This is the deal I** ***almost*** **made (he accepted), before admitting to him that I was taking him for a ride and cancelling the trade**.

* Strange Crusader's Crossbow (maybe 1 ref if sold right now)

* Strange Bushwacka (1 reclaimed)

* Vintage Stockbroker's Scarf (about .6 refined)

* Vintage Banner (2 scrap)

**TOTAL**: 8 ref, maybe. That's &lt;4 keys.

for 

* Unusual Respectless Rubber Glove w/ fetti.

**TOTAL** : Probably 2 buds. Or 20 keys.

*What I would have taken him for*

***More than 1.5 buds***. All because he trusted me when I said ""My offer is worth more than your offer"".

Thankfully for him, and my conscience, I didn't go through with the trade. It took some willpower :P, but I didn't.

So, to recap **don't trust the dirty, filthy, selfish traders**. There are a lot of really good people here that will GLADLY give you a price check. Or, if you're really in a pickle, ask the server itself. They will (usually) tell you if it's a good or bad deal.

Source:

*  http://forums.sourceop.com/forums/32-TF2-Item-Buying-Selling. Just look; the cheapest on the front page is currently $1.69. People are buying in bulk at $1.4, $1.45.  
* Buds have gone from $34-$40+ whilst *decreasing* in key value (27/28-24/25).  

As someone who enjoys being a market spectator and speculator, I'm currently completely stumped as to why this has happened. Anyone got any ideas?

Stuff I know can't be right (at least not without further justification)  

* Events. Nothing is going on right now to lower key supply.  
* Inflation. Keys are rising in metal at the same rate as when they were $1.25-$1.3 each. Plus this is a recent thing. They surged 30 cents in 3 days.  
* Supply. We're still at 487k keys in the game. (Source: http://stats.tf/item/5021/Mann_Co._Supply_Crate_Key). I believe this isn't far off the 500k figure given in a separate discussion about inflation a month ago. **However**, it certainly *feels* like there's less keys floating around. I'm not seeing a flurry of 'SELL KEYS 10 REF EACH' on outpost anymore. I've seen ONE 'keys for paypal' trade there in the past week.

Or is there no actual reason at all?

I also realise that by limiting the amount of trades per day you really do allow people to get a lot more exposure. 

However I have recently been finding it more and more frustrating, especially since the addition of purple text for Unusual tagged trades.

People who would be interested in the strange weapons that I bulk buy aren't going to click on a [STORE] with purple text.

I find that mixing the two detracts from both sales and I am constantly forced to pick what I advertise on a day. My Unusuals, or my Essential Accessories and my Strange Sniper rifle?

Even if it was just increased to being able to put up a trade every 6 hours instead of every 12 hours that would make a real difference to me as a trader or being allowed to do 2 trades a day, but allowed to do 2 at a time it would make /r/tf2trade a tonne more useful to me as a trader.

As it is, I find myself fading away from using /r/tf2trade except when I have a bulk of stranges to sell.

Anyway, putting it out there for discussion, I understand that if we were to do something about increasing the limit of trades per day the amount of admin work would increase dramatically and it might simply not be possible to administer /r/tf2trade effectively with an increased number of posts per day.

Hi!

I have a lot of weapons, and instead of scrap banking them, I decided that I'll start a weapon exchange. Weapons are 1:1 - you trade one weapon for one of my weapons. Metal is also accepted.

(read: This is probably a stupid idea please try not to laugh too hard)


What if the reddit armory took advantage of the newly-created ""uncrafteable"" weapons floating around?


1. **New source of donations.** We all rage at our uncraftable weapons. If the Armory could use them, I'm sure plenty of people would gladly oblige their weapons. (I've got an uncraftable sandman atm, it's all yours Armory) Maybe the armory could even have a ""cleansing"" service where people trade in some amount of untradeable weapons and get (either fewer or equal) weapons that ARE craftable in return. (think the armory should have some uncraftable and some craftable of every weapon btw, not all uncraftables. That might be going too far.)


2. **Minimizing potential abuse of the Armory system.** With uncrafteable weapons, the armory becomes exactly what it was intended to be - a big pile of spare weapons intended to be used in gameplay (and nothing more), for those who do not already have them. Uncraftability makes these weapons less appealing to people who may be looking to take advantage of the Armory.


3. **Uncrafteable weapons find a purpose, and a home.** What is the only use of an uncrafteable weapon? To use it in the game. Why have some uncraftables taking up space in your inv when some newbie could use them? This is practically what uncraftables were made for.

1319043377.0,31,self.tf2trade,lhn8n,[PSA] regarding store bought hats and items.,36,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/lhn8n/psa_regarding_store_bought_hats_and_items/,"Hi /r/tf2trade, can i have a minute of your time?

Okay, now that i have you hooked, let's discuss *non craftable store bought hats.* 

If you buy a hi five taunt, and it turns out not to be craftable, dson't post their personal information and stuff trying to get them marked as a scammer on steam rep, banned from steamrep servers, etc. you weren't going to craft that hi five taunt of schaudenfraude or team captain anyways, were you? im not saying that you would be in the wrong and it was okay. In fact, i understand why you were angry even.

but come on, unless they specifically tried to say that it was craftable, you are just complaining to the air. it should be your responsibility to ask the seller if it is store bought. if they say yes and you dont like that, then you dont have to do the trade and its all good! but if they tell you it is not store bought, and it turns out to be, THEN is the time to take action. 

now so the people who did get affected by this sort of transaaction, i will explain when it is not right to selll store items.

* Store bought weapons. nobody wants a store bought weapon, since pretty much everyone converts weapons to scrap. 

* Craft hats. this is where i see it go rampant, but if they say selling hats for 1 ref ask if its a craftable hat. say yes? buy it. say no? dont. its all about communication. without communication. cause if they DO trick you, you would have nothing to show for it.

* there should be nothing wrong with selling uncraftable more ""rare"" items such as taunts of TC etc because in reality NOBODY is going to craft those. the shaudenfraude, hi five taunt and TC are three examples ive seen from pissed people about them being uncraftable. on /r/tf2 alone.

tl;dr if you buy an uncraftable item and are mad, consider if you would ever actually craft it anyways. if the answer is yes, then you better ask next time.

and if you sell cheap hats as craftable and they aren't, **fuck you.**

1315978294.0,36,self.tf2trade,kf2nc,Trading tips I've learned over two weeks of rigorous trading. People new to trading please read. Experienced traders may learn a thing or two.,38,2,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/kf2nc/trading_tips_ive_learned_over_two_weeks_of/,"This started out as a reply to a comment, but I felt that it would be more beneficial to the trading community. Feel free to add anything I'm missing.

1) Use this site for most of your trades. http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.com/. You have to be careful though because this site doesn't account for demand of an item, which is very important. An item is worth way less if no one / only a small percentage of people are looking for it.

2) Post stuff you want to sell on this subreddit along with the steam forums for tf2 trading. More potential customers never hurts. The worst that can happen is you telling them you don't have it anymore.

3) In trade servers, try not to say the price of the item you're selling. I know it's somewhat unethical but in terms of negotiating the one who speaks first loses. For example, say you are selling a strange grenade launcher in a trade server. Someone bites, engages a trade with you, and then offers you 2 refined metal. You know that is the lowest amount you can possibly get from him. You can probably ask for 2.33 and he will accept. Now, take a step back and think about what would happen if YOU had advertised ""strange grenade launcher 2 ref"", then that's the max amount you can get. He may offer you 1.66 ref and then you would be forced to settle at 1.8. This is actually something I learned from my uncle who negotiates real estate properties for millions of dollars, it makes perfect sense!

4) Again, in trade servers, advertise your goods for 5-10 minutes, if no one is biting go on to the next. You will reach the most potential buyers this way. In addition, be on the look out for good deals when doing this. 

5) When buying, try to pay with things that are not in high demand but have a lot of perceived value. The main example I have of one of these items is the Strange Sniper Rifle. On the spreadsheet it is 2-3 ref, but there's no chance you're ever getting 3 ref, maybe not even 2 ref. BUT, in some transactions you may be able to give the opposite trader it valued at 2 ref. And you never know, maybe the trader will actually use that item!

6) Last but not least, BE FAST. In a trade server or in this sub-reddit, good deals expire quickly, because you have a lot of experienced people trading on both. I know its obvious but learn the path to trading with someone on the same server as you. As a corollary, I don't know how many times I've seen a good deal only to open up the current server list and not remember the seller's name. Make sure you remember it even if you have to repeat it to yourself every trade you make. 

Happy Trading Everyone

**Something HUGE coming up!**

Sometime next week, I will be announcing a big giveaway. ""Is it just going to be the few remaining stuff you got from your donations?"" you ask.
Oh no, no. It's going to be more. SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. *coughs* Sorry about that. But it won't be simple to win. You're going to have to work for it!

Look forward to an announcement sometime next week, but hopefully by the end of Monday tomorrow!

That's all, folks, thanks for reading!

1354891080.0,31,self.tf2trade,14g0z6,[PSA] Introducing The TF2 Economy Project,44,13,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/14g0z6/psa_introducing_the_tf2_economy_project/,"Many of you might have seen the previous discussions held on /r/TF2Trade about having an official, secure, price guide system for the uses of its members.  Well, my team and I are finally able to open for alpha testing, The TF2 Economy Project!

----

**Project Vision:**

To provide the TF2 trading community with a fair, balanced price guide, with votes from elite traders setting the basis of the values.  We also will be aggregating pricing data from several sources, such as Backpack.tf, and present that pricing data to the user.  The TF2 Economy team is dedicated to providing a fair system that we can use ourselves, in light of the main TF2 Spreadsheet conspiracy.  Our system is built from the ground up to be efficient, fast, and secure, without being prone to price manipulation, with myself as the head developer.

The system runs on elected trade officials having votes, not just the average person.  This allows those that are deemed trustworthy by the public to vote to set the price a certain way, and others can enforce or deny this value.  No ""administrator"" has tools to change values directly in the database, although I do have access to this database (which I need as the web dev :P ).  This eliminates many of the issues seen on Backpack.tf and the TF2 Spreadsheet.  Any addition ideas to combat price fraud will be considered.

As for the current design, yes, I know it's horribly ugly.  Yes, I know the front end is fairly bad.  As a front end web developer myself, I've spent most of my time working on the APIs and back end to make TF2 Economy work.  I do have graphics people working on a design, but feel free to submit one of your own if you feel the need.  I'm sure they would love to have additional input.

This system is planned to be the official pricing guide to /r/TF2Trade, so we must build a very good system for their use.

----

**Leadership:**

The leadership of the TF2 Economy project is being divided between several key figures, with several distinct jobs to handle.  The team is as follows:

&gt;MLGM - Head of Graphics
 &gt;&gt;VideoVideo - Graphics Support, along with overall Project Support

&gt;Qwix and ME Chihuahua [MCT] - Project Support, Bug Testing, Brainstorming

&gt;macropower - Head Pricer

&gt;agg23 - Project Lead and Head Developer
&gt;&gt;Ponco - Domain Owner and Development Support

Additional members will be added/removed as necessary.

----

**Pricers:**

What we now need from the community are members who are willing to start using the system.  People who have a high trading reputation, those who are willing to file bug reports, and all around good people.  This system is very much in an alpha state, but as far as I can tell it should be usable.  Additional features will be added as time goes on.

I'm going to shuffle stuff around and get as much stuff from my alts onto here, and have another big store with new stock tomorrow.**

**You'll probably not be seen unless you add me.**

I have 3 accounts full of stuff. I was planning on doing 2 accounts today and running between them, but ugh it's taken me 25 minutes to price this stuff up so I'll re-examine the situation tomorrow.

However, I'll just say that everything in http://steamcommunity.com/id/communistflutter3 and http://steamcommunity.com/id/communistflutter5 is also for sale, if you so want.

As always, my rules:

- Overpay in items, prices flexible but usually the cheapest around.

- Cash accepted at $1.25 per key, $0.50 per ref ($5 minimum; no more than $20 without rep and you must post here as well)

- Keys preferred and accepted as 2.55.

- Just add me; it's fine.

- The list is usually accurate, but not always. Double check my bp.

I've noticed quite a few pricing guides around the web, but none that are community driven. I know the people who write the guides have a great understanding of the pricing in the community, but don't always paint an accurate picture and can dictate the pricing quite well. What I have done and am still in the process of is producing a community driven pricing guide which is based off what people are currently trading for. For this to work I needed a good data set to work off. I work as an analyst programmer for a holiday company and know how to write accurate reports based off trending and growth. This is what I would like to do with the Team Fortress 2 Items, but have absolutely no input myself on what I believe the items value should be. This would be a good project if it was based an existing data set, but it would be pointless to simply ask another trading site for a copy of their data without being laughed at. So along with the pricing data I needed an accompanying trading site which is what I have done. This isn't a money grabbing exercise, I don't ask for subscriptions, donations and my site is completely AD free (based off what the hosting costs reach).
Here is a sample page of the pricing guide http://www.tf2trader.net/items/item/id/40 ( this is a very early concept and I need to factor in other currencies to it yet ).
The site can be found at http://www.tf2trader.net
It is in early beta and the code needs to be cleaned up a lot, I've written the entire site myself and any feedback is much appreciated.

But that is not the point here.

If you know someone who has been scammed, PM me, and tell me about it. I have about 20 packages to send out to people who have been scammed. They are not much, but it is enough to make your friend's day. :)

Just write up a little something, make sure to include your friend's steam ID (and a link to their profile!). If it touches our hearts, we will send a gift.

You can't write something for yourself. Only something that has happened to someone you know. (Hopefully within the last month or two)

Please don't post in the comments (you can post stuff like 'awesome' or whatever, but just don't put your letter down there), we want it to be a suprize to anyone who gets it!


If you want to donate to our cause, or just have a chat, friend me on steam.

* If you take the risk, make sure to examine the URL closely before clicking

* If the site is a forgery, as stated in another PSA about said forgeries, contact the abuse department of the webhost (use [DomainTools](http://domaintools.com) to do this), [report it to Google](http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/), and [rate it on WOT](http://mywot.com)

* And as always, [check SteamRep](http://steamrep.com) to see if the person you're trading with is a scammer. If you're trading in money or other high-value items, ask for a feedback/reputation thread.

**UPDATE: Hello all! This morning was very busy, I will continue to do this until tonight, but for the next several hours I will be on and off my computer.  Just add me and I will get to you soon.**


Hey everyone! I've got some time to burn this morning and want people to make use of these weapons, or scrap them down for me, and I'm trying to get my inventory down to metal and keys, hopefully these prices will help facilitate that, soo...

If you want weapons it's just a 1:1 exchange with craftable weapons, OR I will obviously take metal.

I used to do a lot of trading in tf2 but just before Christmas i gave all my stuff away on /r/tf2. I have since been working on this app which lets you track your trades, so that you know when you bought an item, how much you paid for it and potentially who from.


The app is in early alpha (mainly because i kill the server by accident once a day) but the main functionality is there and it is already quite useful.


Here is a link to the website [tf2bank](http://tf2bank.com). You dont have to do anything else but sign up (we use steam openid so you dont have to give us your username or password only an email address). The app does the rest and you can go review your trades at anytime.

Here is my [trades page](http://tf2bank.com/monitor/trades/?id=76561198044442098), so you can get a feel of what it looks like. Dont worry your trades cant be seen by other people.

Im releasing this exclusively on reddit for now and depending on the reception i might have to limit numbers because im not sure what the server can handle. 

Any questions or feedback please let me know, i am adding new stuff making it better nearly daily. Im currently trying to get it to show more information when you hover over an item :).

Cheers thorhat - i dont get any karma if you upvote, but it helps spread the word :)

The hats are found on TF2TP here: http://tf2tp.com/profile.php?user=104179

They have all come out of [Sgt. Woods' pack](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031239009), and he was a notable hearts collector.

Please do not justify or encourage this type of behavior by knowingly buying these hats at quicksale prices! This is a classic hijack/quicksell scheme; the hijacker gained access to the account and quickly traded off the unusuals to an alt, where they are dumped at very low bud buyouts, and the buds later converted to keys or cash. You can identify that this is the case because of the backpack of the mule account having 0.4 hours of TF2 played, and a backpack full of unusuals.

Any trader found with one of these hats after this psa gets posted is subject to judgement from not only /tf2trade, but SteamRep as well.

Edit (I was asleep): What I mean by ""subject to judgement"" more or less implies what thoax has posted below [(here)](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/p2x6k/mini_psa_hearts_unusual_collection_hijacked_do/c3m31ee).

The above message is what you will get if you buy a gift copy of a game from somebody who has either purchased the game with a stolen credit card, or issued a chargeback through PayPal (if they bought the game from Steam with PayPal).

What does this mean for you? It means you no longer own the game you just traded for. You can't get it back, either. Whatever items you traded away are likely to be gone forever.

But, if this happens to you, I **strongly** suggest that you open up a Steam Support ticket. Steam Support can easily look up the trade where you bought the gifted game, and they may be able to return your items back into your Steam inventory for you. Then report the person to the admins of whatever network you met them from, and hope that you can get them flagged on SteamRep as a scammer.

While this particular person hasn't been flagged on SteamRep yet, I'd suggest being on watch for [this particular trader](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eddisthebest). Judging by the comments on his profile, he's been doing this a lot. His inventory is full of keys, hats, and other items, so he's been ripping a lot of people off.

Also keep in mind that you can't scam an honest man. If they're offering you a game for only a few TF2 items, it probably is too good to be true.

Thought I would give a tip of advice to our newer players here to help them avoid a common mistake!

Many items require a nice chunk of metal + weapons to craft. For example, lets say you want to make a Tomislav! Fine Heavy weapon I say. Well, here's the steps involved:

* First step is making a Brass Beast. You'll need a Natascha and 3 scrap (1 Reclaimed.).
* Now, you'll need to take your Brass Beast and add Two reclaimed (6 scrap) to make a Tomislav.

Sounds simple, right? Until you learn that most people sell Tomislavs for only 1 scrap, 2 at the most. You just spent 9 scrap making it, losing 8 in the process. With those 8 scrap, you could've gotten 7-8 more weapons, saved them to be turned into reclaimed for trading, or whatever else you want!

General rule of thumb : If it's a normal weapon and it hasn't debuted in 4+ weeks or so, it's probably only worth 1-2 scrap at best. The newer guns are already dropping in price. I give it 4 more weeks until they're worth about 2-3 scrap.",,False,,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,t3_jpcte,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jpcte/a_friendly_note_to_newer_players_regarding/,

* State if there's anything special (I don't want to sell page X, everything except this unusual, just page 3, etc).

However, some people transferred these spells to their alt and idle accounts causing them to not disappear. 

However, there emerged a glitch where some of these paints were still usable and their effects were still visible in game. **Valve has acknowledged this glitch and said they will not tamper with the spells or items with spells on them.** 

**HOW TO ADD PAINT SPELLS TO HATS** 

Launch tf2 *without* the spells in your backpack. Obtain the paint you want by trading your alt/a seller. The paint will now be in your backpack. Select the paint and press ""use with"". Select the hat you wish to use the paint on. That hat now has a Halloween Paint spell on it that is visible and distinguishable in game! They look amazing on unusuals and bills hats!

***PLEASE TAKE THESE AWAY FROM ME AS I WANT TO PLAY TF2 AND MY ALT IS MALFUNCTIONING*** ;_;

* Strange sapper: 9 keys 1.66 ref (backpack.tf: 10 keys)
*Because if you don't have a strange in every slot one is available in, you are clearly inferior. Also the most valuable of the crate 40 stranges, and I'm sure crate 50 will arrive within the next year or so.*

It seemed like the right place to ask for suggestions, as I'll explain.

So Windows 8 comes out today/tomorrow, and some of you may be upgrading to it. Reservations you have about the UI aside, TF2 works fine, so I decided to make a TF2 item app to learn about development.

For this application, which I have affectionately dubbed [Fat Scout](http://i.imgur.com/leBvM.png), I currently have [integration with Win8's search charm](http://i.imgur.com/OzSTfh.png) which pulls in data from the item schema and sorts it by name, applicable classes, slot, etc, which you could all search for.

On the search page itself [you can sort by slot type](http://i.imgur.com/7E3FQh.png). To make things simpler I grouped all the extra things (from sappers to medals) in the ""other"" category.

The item page itself [pulls images from the item schema, and pulls relevant information from the official TF2 wiki](http://i.imgur.com/04fBFh.png).

It also currently [pulls pricing data from backpack.tf, and searches this subreddit for the most recent relevant trade posts (or at least as relevant as Reddit's silly search thinks so)](http://i.imgur.com/8SamDh.png). As you can see on the side, I'm planning on pulling trades from [bazaar.tf](http://bazaar.tf) as well, but that'll be a bit more difficult since they don't provide an API for trades, so I'll have to scrape data from their actual webpages (if they give me permission of course).

Clicking on the reddit posts [brings you to the relevant page of course](http://i.imgur.com/8OzVIh.png). In the future, instead of opening links in a browser application, I want to put a pop-out iframe so that you can browse relevant websites without having to leave the application, a convenience.

Here are some other things I'm planning on doing:

* Front page will show list of most recent items looked at, and a ""watched"" item list, a list of items that you chose to pin to the front
* The ability to set notifications for prices - the app'll poll backpack.tf once a day or so for the prices of your watched items, and if the price changes since you initially watched it, you'll get a notification, either in the form of a toast notification (think the growl popups in Mac OSX if you're not familiar with Win8) or updates to the tile of the application
* Third column on the main page, ""popular items"". You can see what items other people are most looking at. Market interest analysis, anyone?
* Some sort of integration with a TF2 item stats website, provide more item data than just from the wiki
* Some sort of user backpack integration. I know the API for accessing backpack data, but I have no clue how to integrate it into the existing UI smoothly

[](/ajsup) So what do you guys think? Any missing features immediately jump out at you? The UI making your eyes bleed? I really would love some suggestions before I decide that this is ""finished"". Whether or not you ever use the app or not (it'll be free if you do!), or even upgrade to Windows 8 (I understand not everyone loves it), I'd still love some feedback, because this is definitely a learning experience for me.

I've been getting orangereds for this post but a lot of comments and replies aren't showing up.

I've decided to liquidate most things in my backpack for metal, since I don't use most of these items - so please, take them off my hands! Every item is a good deal, and you'll probably be able to turn some profit from it.

If you don't agree with my price, or don't have metal/keys, feel free to make a different offer!

Add me; I'm online now!

Please **upvote this post for _visibility_** - I receive **NO KARMA** for this.

------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, I also started up a trade server a few days ago. It doesn't have a lot of traffic/people right now, so I'd be very happy if you guys would go there to check it out! :)

**The IP address is tf2.servegame.com, so you can either add the server from the ""Favorites"" tab and then click ""Add a Server"", or just type ""connect tf2.servegame.com"" into the console.  Alternately, if you have Steam running, you can just [click here!](steam://connect/tf2.servegame.com:27015)**

Stay tuned to /r/tf2trade next week as I will be announcing several giveaways and one BIG EVENT with an awesome prize! All hosted on my trade server, of course.

Here's a couple of thoughts to keep in mind when trying to value your new item:

- For a low-craft item or hat (#1-100), no one has a damn clue what it's worth.  There's obviously going to be a lot of hype about them given Meet the Pyro and shiny new things, but just put the item out there, be patient, and see what all comes your way.  It's difficult to put a price on any craft # item, let alone brand new ones.

- For the normal/strange, craftable version of new items/hats/crates/keys, do the exact same thing.  Will be a lot easier in this case as you can check places such as here, tf2outpost, etc. and get a fairly good estimate of what they'll sell for by simply looking at offers and what others have sold/purchased them for.  Just note that the price will likely fall over the next few days/week when the interest starts to die down.

There's literally nothing else to do at this point as there's no ""set"" values, and won't be for a few days at minimum.

today I have my first unusual hat for sale here. It is a larrikin robin with the nuts and bolts effect. 

I am looking for around 16-17 keys on this hat, as my own sniper skills are ~~not good enough~~ ~~abysmal~~ so bad I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. 

So if you enjoy playing sniper and want a cheap unusual, then this is your chance. 

I am open to all kind of offers or comments. So if you got keys, refined, lots of items or a mix of all the above that sums up to around 16-17 keys, feel free to offer and add me. 

If you have none of the above I would also accept money, as long as your reputation on reddit and/or sourceop is good.

**current offer 1: ~41 ref+g. war head (44 ref total) by Mueffls**

**current offer 2: str. Kritzkrieg+stuff (16+2 keys) + dirty marauder (1.66 ref) ref by IrrelevantGeOff**

**current offer 3: crate 40 + 10 keys (~18 keys) by Dave+**
*****
**Edit: Yeah, the hat is still for sale, as I just woke up again. I should be reachable during the next 14 hours, as I will be on and off during that time. Just add and drop me a msg, so that I can come back to you**

**Edit2: I'll take the highest offer when I come back from dinner with my friends. 

As of writing this the local time here is 19:46 (in NY it's 13:46:57 EDT now), and I should return around midnight-2am. Ergo, in approx 4-6 hours from this point. 
**

**Edit3: Currently on my gf's laptop without steam. Just updating this, to tell you that I'll be home in around 30 mins. The bidding will end then.

 - Add the object entindex to the object_deflected game event

 - 本地化檔案已更新

**For other Source engine games**:

I'm going to try and help there as much as I can.  Because of a combination of this, and the fact that I have a pretty busy meatspace life at the moment, It's unlikely I'll be making more weapon swap threads in the near future.  I'll still keep the weapons and sign on from time to time so you're welcome to add me if you're patient but I wont be making any more threads for a little while.  My intention is to help more people and do more swaps as part of the Armory than I could here.  When I get a break in real life I'll probably make more threads but not in the near future.  Until then, add the Armory for all your weapon swap needs.  So thanks everyone for the support while I've been doing this.

tl;dr After this thread my weapon swap is on hiatus but I'm still swapping as part of the armory.

The rules are simple. You tell me what you want for your unusual, and I get it. When I find a trade for you, then I inform you as soon as I can and then get you your awesome profit! I only require a small fee for this that is always negotiable.

1324351794.0,30,self.tf2trade,njdbv,[PSA] This Friday (12/23) I will be buying Steam games for TF2 items,38,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/njdbv/psa_this_friday_1223_i_will_be_buying_steam_games/,"Hey Guys!

[A lot of you probably remember and participated in this thread during the November sales.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/mr4vx/h_7495_in_my_steam_account_w_to_buy_you_games_for/) I will once again be doing this for the Reddit community. It will be somewhere between $200 - $300 this time around (last time was $250). For those of you not familiar, you will post the game you want on the thread to come, and which items you are paying with. I will then add you and sell you that game for those items.

However, due to the drop in the monetary prices of metal and keys, I will be readjusting my pricing scale. This way, you can make sure you have the items you need available when this goes live. The pricing will be as follows:

* Reclaimed Metal = $.20

* Refined Metal = $.60

* Keys = $1.60

* Bill's Hat = $11

* Buds = $25

While I had to unfortunately change the prices, and I understand that some of you may be upset, understand that I am still taking a slight loss. 

Ex: $200 would get me 8 Buds at $25 each. If I am paid via this in all refined metal it works out as follows. 

$200/.60 = 333.33 Refined

If I could manage to get every key at 2.5, 333.33/2.5 = 133 Keys

With Buds at 17 Keys each, I would get 7.8 Buds.

With the above example, I hope you understand why I lowered the value of everything.

Mark your calenders though, if you're still interested! I will most likely start the post at 6:30 PM EST. It will once again be on a first come, first serve basis.

Happy Trading!

Over the past week I've been hard at work on pushing out a new version of Mist for you guys. I can say that v3.0.0 of Mist has been jam-packed with new features, tweaks and fixes to make trading more secure and better than ever.

I won't be explaining what Mist does again, so if you're curious, check out [the previous thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1arac1/psa_hey_guys_remember_mist_the_portable/).  
**TL;DR:** It's an awesome portable, open-source Steam client that lets you chat and trade on any computer without installing a thing. It's under 2 MB zipped up :)

Now at this point I'm sure you're eager to hear about the new features, so I'm proud to present Mist v3.0.0's changelog:

###ChangeLog
- Added a ""View Profile"" option when right-clicking on a friend. This will open their Steam profile in your default browser.  
- Implemented filtering/search in the friends' list.  
- **Implemented an auto-updater. Mist can now update itself without you going to the Steam group.**  
- **Implemented chat logging. This can be turned off if you wish. Feature is on by default.**  
- Implemented chat log viewer. Just right click on your friend.  
- **Added automatic SteamRep checking when chatting with people on your friends list. You will be notified of scammers or users with special reputation.**  
- Added colors to chat. This makes everything much easier to read.  
- Added backpack.tf price-checking in the backpack viewer.  
- **Added backpack.tf price-checking in trade. This feature is turned off by default.**  
- Added colors to trade chat. Items added to trade will now be displayed with their respective quality colors in trade chat.  
- Trade events will be logged in the chat log.  
- Mist now notifies friends that the user is using the application via a ""Now Playing"" notification.  
- Added exit option to Mist.  
- General bug fixes and tweaks.

1362873475.0,29,self.tf2trade,19zvym,[PSA] Attempting to Sell Gifted Stranges as a Certain Rank is Scamming,33,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/19zvym/psa_attempting_to_sell_gifted_stranges_as_a/,"More accurate when it says Now Scamming. This is due to the recent update where gifting stranges now resets their counters where as they used to not. Never really a major problem, but since this was changed recently, so has the feelings towards this.

---------

An Example:

Player A is selling a Saxton's Own [Strange] that is gifted to anyone willing to pay ""X"" amount of currency. 

------------

I've consulted with fellow admins like Crate about this and this is considered scamming by them, because since the counter resets it is no longer the item you have advertised it as.  Do **NOT** sell items like these on the servers (and by effect I would also assume here). Doing so will get you marked and banned from multiple servers.

I don't think the effects generated are random anymore and I'm thinking they have chosen some effects to be much more common than others, and the common effects all seem to be on the lower side of desirability. I imagine this has been done to keep some effects as high value to encourage unboxing. But when you look at the numbers it has never been such a bad time to unbox.

----

Edit, looks like the old effects are all but discontinued if you look at the particle effects sheet on [stats.tf](http://stats.tf/particles), months ago when I looked at it everything was fairly even with the exception of the Halloween effects, now there are twice as many new effects as old.

I'm not personally affiliated with the site but I do use it. As a seller you have to be comfortable with leaving your items on their bots and the potential risk of glitches and bugs, but as a buyer there is no real risk involved as you can trade entirely through Steam.

1351393259.0,30,self.tf2trade,127bse,[PSA] I made a guide for this years drop system. (Xpost /r/tf2),34,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/127bse/psa_i_made_a_guide_for_this_years_drop_system/,"Hello! I am 95% sure I have this year's present drop system figured out, and how to get more drops/less time.

For starters, let's check out how the private gift system works. As taken directly from the wiki; ""Gift spawning is timed in 5 minute intervals, with the gift appearing 5 minutes into the round or 5 minutes after the last gift was claimed. An alert will be sent to a random player when it appears in the map. The gift can only be seen and grabbed by the random player that was selected."" There must also be at least 10 people in the server, whether they be spectating or in the process of joining and loading the map.This means that once every five minutes after the start of the round or 5 minutes the last gift is picked up, a new one will spawn. NOT 5 minutes after the last gift spawned. This means if the recipient of the last gift take three minutes to find the gift, the next gift will have an interval of 8 minutes before the previous.
Now, for the odds of the private gift being yours. The gift will spawn for one person, and one person only, with even odds for each player. In a 32 person server with 32 in it, you will have a 1/32 chance. Now, in a 12 man server, you have a 1/12 chance to have the gift be yours.

Now, for the odds of the private gift being yours. The gift will spawn for one person, and one person only, with even odds for each player. In a 32 person server with 32 in it, you will have a 1/32 chance. Now, in a 12 man server, you have a 1/12 chance to have the gift be yours

For perfect gift dropping chances, you need a server with exactly 10 people, giving you a 1/10 chance. Even people spectating or joining have a chance for the gift, so a constant 1/10 chance. Gifts will have less of an interval if the gift is picked up faster, so the person with the gift should say in chat ""Gift, truce"" so the gift gets to other people faster, minimizing time.

Idle accounts can be utilized if you A) Run two instances of TF2 at a time or B) Use a spare computer. This would give you a 1/5 chance, optimally, if you have a 10 person server.
TO find a server with a small amount of people limit, type in the map name in the search (under map) and under max player count type either 10 or 12 (or another low number) so there can only be a small limit of people at a time, further increasing your odds.

Now, the best possible server and odds would be 10 people, 2 accounts going at once, with truces and cooperation. Insta respawn time is good, and when you pick up the gift, you won't get the item found screen. If you refresh your backpack by dying and clicking ""Organize Backpack"", the item will appear in your backpack, but you will have to manually scan for it if you want to know what it was.

With an insta respawn with 10 people with 2 accounts and fast pickups, you have a 1/5 chance of getting the gift and greater odds of actually being able to reach it. This averages to a low amount of time.
In a 32 man server with 1 account and low cooperation, the odds are 1/32 with small chance of reaching the gift to get your reward. This takes about 1 1/2 hours for each gift obtained.
This works on all the gift dropping maps.

On the new map, it spawns near the CP, so look in that area. If you go into the buildings or through the tunnels near the spawn, they won't be there (based on my experience).
Also, these should be correct, but if some are wrong, son't get mad at me. It's based off of my experience, so some things might be different for you.

TL;DR Find a server with low max players, with at least 10 in the server, and be nice and cooperate. Check near the CP in the new map for the gifts. Use more accounts in the same server for greater odds.

Edit: 1 Gift drop per team? Seems to make sense, and I think that does happen.

2. Say what coupon you want

3. I want to say 1 coupon per person but if you really want more than one, I might make an exception.

I have recently concocted what I believe to be quite a useful little tool for frequenters of steamcommunity profiles like ourselves.

It adds and modifies the ""Actions"" section on a steamcommunity profile page to make it more convenient for power users.

Features:

* Adds handy ""View Backpack on TF2B"" and ""View SteamRep Profile"" links.
* Adds an ""Edit Notes"" section, allowing you to keep per-user notes - now you won't forget why you added people!
* Adds a basic link containing the Steam ID of the user, for easy copy-paste access.
* Makes ""Add to my Friends List"" use a steam:// protocol link, so you can add people via profile pages without having to be logged in to steamcommunity via the browser.

If you have basic programming knowledge it's also quite simple to customise to your own liking and add your own links. Just edit the userscript and take a look towards the bottom. **Edit:** A quick general editing tutorial [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/phlh0/tool_greasemonkeyuserscripts_to_make_trading_life/c3plhc4), and instructions on how to change it to TF2Items [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/phlh0/tool_greasemonkeyuserscripts_to_make_trading_life/c3plpcq).

I've personally found this useful and I hope you guys do as well. If you use Firefox, you can install this after first installing the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), Opera users can install it if they have the [Greasemonkey Emulating Script](http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/operaStuff/userJavaScript.html#compatibility), and Chrome users can install it without the need for any extensions.

[Screenshot here](http://imgur.com/qy6C2)

[DOWNLOAD/INSTALL HERE!](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/125279)

Other Greasemonkey scripts that you may find useful: 

* [Add SteamRep to Steam Community profiles](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/124931) by Mattie! - Adds SteamRep and TF2Items as frames at the bottom of a steamcommunity page.

* [tf2items tweak + Unusuals](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/119856) by Mattie! - makes unusuals and earbuds more noticable on TF2Items.

* [TF2TP ""Add Friend"" Button](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/126864) by me - Adds an ""Add friend"" Button next to [TF2TP](http://www.tf2tp.com) trades.

Current offer 300$ by http://steamcommunity.com/id/sripakdp

Hello all, 

Let me introduce myself, I am Orion Supergan. I am posting here today in hopes that I can find someone who is interested in what I am selling. And BTW, yes that is my real name, feel free to google it. 

So story goes like this: Yay it's Christmas time. Ooooh, shiny crate. Hey I have a few spare dollars, *buys key*. Huh, I got a hat... aww sucky, it doesn't look very cool. Oh well,  my very first unusual! 

I get lots of random friend invites over the next few days asking to trade for the hat and become suspicious. Eventually I look up the hat and find it is considered very wanted. Cool... Then I am told its apx value in cash is up to 500-600$! Like... holy $#!+. 

Now to the situation I am in that would have me trade away my first and only unusual hat. Simply put, I want to propose to my girlfriend. Having her in my life has enabled me to become a happier, more contented person than at any point in my life before. And after 1.5 years of dating, now feels like the right time to take the next step. And with the sale of this item, I can propose with a ring suitable to the woman who will be wearing it. (here is a pic of us on a date to Seattle: https://d.facdn.net/art/orion/1305871886.orion_sketchy.jpg )

To me, TF2 is a very fun game that I have played consistently since it was released. I have never gotten into trading because I would rather spend what few hours I have actually playing than item swapping. After the looking into trading I have done since getting the hat, that may be a factor that bites me in the butt since I have zero trading rep.

The 600$ is what I was told was the value, if I was mis-informed please forgive. 

If anyone is interested in the trade, I will to use a middleman that is recognized by SteamRep/SourceOP. 

I thank you for reading this. And to whoever does end up purchasing the hat, you can expect wedding pictures to be sent to wherever in this world you live. :)

They list server admins, trusted sellers, and trusted middle men. But most importantly, they also list scammers.

Think of it like a background check for TF2 traders.


SteamRep also allows a plugin for game servers. Meaning if you are banned from one of the SteamRep network's servers as a scammer, or marked as a scammer by an admin then you cannot connect to any server that participates with SteamRep.

As of last night, our server is running this mod that hooks in with SteamRep. So, if you try to connect and it automatically bans you, do the following:

1. Go to www.steamrep.com and see if you are marked as a scammer. if you are, go to their FAQ and follow those directions.

2. If you are not marked as a scammer, send me a reddit PM with your Steam ID, the time you tried to connect, and the nickname you use.

We are very excited to team up with SteamRep. If you have any questions, please ask!",,False,,t5_2s0s4,True,,trusted hat,True,t3_j9qts,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/j9qts/we_are_now_part_of_steamreps_antiscammer_network/,moderator

I buy buds literally all the time, and I get paid every day or two. So, if you have a lot of buds and are always restocking, I would be interested in having you supply me for the long term. I generally pay a dollar or so more than the market price, and I'm paypal verified-- so you don't have to worry about chargebacks.

--------------------

We will need people to be ""Rematchers"" for Secret Santas that got shafted by Bad Santas and didn't receive a gift. Simply send [this message (click)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Cheesydude&amp;subject=Rematcher&amp;message=I%20would%20like%20to%20be%20a%20rematcher%20please) and you'll be entered as a Rematcher. Please note, you will only be assigned someone to gift to and will not receive another gift by signing up to be a Rematcher. There is no guarantee that you will be called upon as we're hoping that we don't have any Bad Santas this year. Rematchers will be called upon in the following days if necessary. 


It's been a great event, most of which would have never been possible without help from /u/DrKabob who created our Secret Santa bot &amp; helped provide us with server hosting for the bot itself.

So first you need to ascertain the reasonable market value range of your new unusual. To do this, I'd start with the following guidelines:

Harvest Moon + It's a Secret to Everbody is approximately equal to Cloudy Moon of the same hat. Those prices should be fairly established (check backpack.tf/unusuals and google 'pc moon XXX' for some idea of the range).

The other effects are probably worth a bit less, I'd put them around the value of Scorching Flames/Sunbeams. So price check your hat accordingly. Others will surely disagree with my pricing strategy, but it's a start. Ultimately hats are worth only what someone else is willing to pay.

So let's hypothesize that your new hat is worth 10 buds based on the above. I'd want to move it into a more-stable situation asap. That means trade it for buds or for an established-value hat.

So with that 10 bud unusual you just unboxed, list it on OP for 11-12 buds, and sell it for 10. You'll get mostly unusual offers. I would take unusual offers that have a median selling price of 12 buds. You might get 2 or 3 hats that add up to your overpaid BO in unusuals. They need to overpay in unusuals, but ultimately you really want to get that halloween hat (which could have a second or third unboxed at any moment and the market on those effects could crash) as soon as possible.

Now that you've got buds or a slightly-more-valuable established-price hat, you have to decide whether you want to trade that hat (or hats, if you sold yours for 2 or 3) for unusuals of your choosing, or you want to get the cash out, or a combination of the two.

If you do want to convert some or all of the value back out into cash, then make sure the person you're selling to for cash has strong SOP rep. Make sure it's from sourceop.com and not soureop.com (as many scammer use) and always check everyone you deal with against streamrep.com to be sure they haven't already been marked as a scammer. 

I'd also make sure their SOP rep thread is at least 2-3 months old so you're not at great risk of a chargeback scam.

Hope that's helpful!",,False,,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,t3_12futp,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/12futp/psa_what_to_do_after_unboxing_your_first/,

First off, I'd like to apologise to everyone last night. I expected it to be busy, but not THAT busy (I had a queue of 8 people at one time)...and I had to go off earlier than I had hoped due to tiredness. I also never got around to updating the list, so a lot of people didn't get what they wanted. I woke up to a lot of messages and invites as well. All in all, I am very sorry for the general lack of organisation and everything. :(

I'll try and make stuff neater too, since the text here gets hard to read.

* I take keys as 2.55 ref in items and will add for them. I will buy them outright for 2.5 refined too. Scorched at 1 key + 1 ref (note I do not buy scorched keys outright, only for items).
* All prices are flexible.
* I do take items, but you need to overpay.
* Add me please (http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecommieduck) since I get too much activity to hunt down all the commenters. :)
* ~~UPVOTE OR DIE~~  
* I do take paypal; up to $30 of it without significant rep. Just ask.
* Keys and metal are interchangeable; I just list some in keys and some in refined.
* if you do not see your tf2 inventory, f5 a lot. If you cannot place in the window, resend the trade.

Thanks guys, happy trading!

Is there something I'm doing?

I am buying keys at 2.55 ref each, but you must have 4 or more else the price drops to 2.5 ref each. They always count as 2.55 ref in hats or other stuff and I can add for them.

I sell:

* 84 keys @ $1.32 each
* 62 ref @ $0.52 each. 

http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=77419

You need rep for any more than 10 keys/25 ref. 

Everything is flexible, especially if you buy lots. I always take paypal for items at the above rates.

**If you want my backpack buying services, scroll to the bottom please.**

Upvotes are always appreciated. :D

Drop me an add! :) http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecommieduck

**Backpack buying**

Sick of TF2? Need monies?

I am buying entire backpacks for Paypal/Steam wallet. I have $500+ to work with. My ideal limit is around the $200 per pack, but I'll see what appears.

I can buy everything, or only certain pages, or everything minus a few things. If some stuff needs wrap I will provide it.

You do not get full price (needs to be clear); I take a cut but you save the time of selling everything and selling that stuff for paypal. That can be an awful lot of saving. I know I've spent &gt;$1000+ on backpacks.

---

Leave a note here/PM/add me if you're interested. Leaving at least a guideline price ($10 or $200 or whatever) will help me save time and help us work out a deal.

Note I do not treat promos or unusuals or # numbers or other difficult to sell/price items at market price; everything is hand valued and then I subtract a small percentage.

Hi everyone.

I am the_surgeon, some of you may remember me from my previous weapon swap threads.  I am taking care of the armory for now.

~~The main reason for making this thread is that I am looking for help.  A lot of you have probably realised the armory has not been online as much as it should be, which is largely my fault.  I have a busy IRL life.  I'm looking for a couple of people to help us out.  You would just need to jump on the armory account from time to time and do some swaps.  It would be ideal if you could do this every couple of days or so.  For obvious reasons I can't give access to the armory account to just anyone.  I don't have set requirements but you can't be a brand new reddit or steam account or anything like that.  Please send me a PM or add me personally (not the armory account) on steam (flair) and we'll talk about it.~~

Because the friends list is becoming very full I will also ask that if you are in the armory friends list but not actively looking to trade at the moment please remove us so we can free up space.  You are welcome to join the [armory steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditarmory) to keep in touch with us.

The new players armory has been restored in all its former glory.  It is technically a different account now but it is linked from the group page and anyone who is new and looking for help getting started is welcome to come and say hello.

I don't have admin access on the group page or new players armory so I will comment there with this information.

Finally, [our current stock.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/redditarmory2/inventory/)

Thank you very much for reading and thank you to everyone who has already helped support the armory.

After many, many hours of playing, trading and idling it is time for me to say goodbye to TF2 (at least the trading aspect of it). I am getting rid of my vast collection of Hats, Genuines, Vintages and Promos (keeping the stranges to continue playing). Most of these will be sold as sets so I can be rid of this as fast and as easily as possible. 

I am open to negotiation but I am firm on most of these prices so please add me via flair to discuss. Thanks in advance! I accept Keys as 2.44 Ref or 2 for 5 Ref to make it easy.

In only a few months of trading I was never offered cash that I didn't request. When I asked for hat offers I got hat offers.

**In just the last week I have been Friended approximately a dozen times by people offering me cash for my hat.**

If it isn't already your policy to Decline those then consider it - it is rude unless you specifically ask for it anyways. If you are looking for cash or will entertain cash offers then be 10x wary. You pick the middleman. You open the dialogues. You double-check and screen cap everything.

I just lost $30+ on a trade with a 'reputable' trader.",32,1,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/nuq4n/psa_dont_trust_reputation_and_do_your_research_i/,"To start off, I don't really care about the money, but hopefully this helps you in the future.

Initially, I had a trade going for selling keys, both here and on http://www.tf2outpost.com/. After no luck here, I got a friend request by a person called 'Dannyz' (http://steamcommunity.com/id/dannyjaya/) who says that they are from tf2outpost.com and were after my keys.

After a lengthy discussion on reputation, I figure that the rep on his profile is more than enough for me to believe him as well has a ton of hours played on TF2. 

After a bit more discussion on the method of transfer, I agree to give him 20 keys first, and he will follow up with a payment of $32. I trade him, send him the keys, and then poor grammar and (hilariously bad) excuses ensue.  

*****

Dannyz: i have friend working at paypal dont worry

Dannyz: i can call him in-phone now

*****

drfunbuster +M: Paypal is instant my friend.

Dannyz: yes its 100% true

Dannyz: wired with you =/

Dannyz: i guess your balance is $0 the problem

drfunbuster +M: No, that isn't a problem.

Dannyz: paypal will let any transaction pass if at leat there $1.95 balance

Dannyz: $1.95 is ""safe condition""

*****

Now to the thing that completely fucked me over. His reputation. First off, I checked it and looked at each of the persons profiles, and they seemed reputable enough so I thought nothing of it. After trading the keys and the paypal payment not arriving I figure he is just delayed somewhat. A few excuses later I look at the reputations again. 

**""Fuck""**

They're all from Indonesia. 

(*to clarify, I'm meaning that each person on his profile was from the same place that he was, it could be any country, it most likely means that they are either his own accounts or his friends*)

*****

Moral of the story: Do some god damn research on the people on their profile, don't listen to shitty excuses (no matter how terrible they are) and if nothing else refuse if they don't go first or don't have SourceOP or any other reputation. Steamrep is too easily forged, and I fell for it.

It's the seller's responsibility to research the value of their item. Think about selling a car, or a rare comic book, or a vintage guitar-anything really. If an item has a chance to be valuable, you are only hurting yourself to not learn the value and get the proper payment (virtual item or real world cash). 

Smart buyers will shop around and try and find the best deals. It may be thought of as ""ripping off"" a misinformed seller, but that's not really how an economy works. 

We think of ourselves as redditors as slightly more honest and ""good"" people than the rest of the Internet, but you must remember that all others don't have that moral compass to guide their decisions and transactions. You can't blame others for screwing you unless you take the time to learn what your value is worth. That's the nice thing about reddit, and a large chunk of the tf2 community. We are a generally helpful group, who are willing to be honest and lend a hand to the less knowledgeable new guys. 

Just don't expect everyone to show you the same courtesy.

You really don't have to price check them - they have a value already, in USD (or pounds or Euros or whatever) and then you should just translate that into in game currency.  

Sure it's not going to be foolproof or 100% accurate, but price checks aren't supposed to be.  The value of the item you are selling is what a buyer is willing to pay for it.  Price checks are to make sure you aren't being ripped off, more or less.  If you paid $20 for a game and someone wants to give you 2 hats for it? Probably not worth it.  Price checking the in-game items you might trade for? That's logical.  The game? Not necessary.

**Edit:** For those of you that are new to this game, here's a cheat sheet of in game values in USD:

1 Refined - $.7-1

1 Key - $2-2.50

1 Bill's Hat - $8-12

1 Earbuds - $18-24

1 Max's Head - $~70

(Obviously these figures are not exact - but they give you an idea what a fair trade might look like.)

**Edit #2:** As GrayFawkes points out, the in-game value of an item is *not* in any way reflective of its price in the MannCo Store, (with the exception of items that can only be bought (or difficult to acquire otherwise, i.e. - keys, gift wrap, etc.)  While that would seem to be a perfectly logical and efficient way to price our economy, it does not reflect the supply and demand that drives the trading market and would simply turn otherwise valueless items into currency.",,False,,t5_2s0s4,True,,trusted,True,t3_jexaf,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jexaf/a_note_about_price_checks_and_steam_games/,

Cheers for entering guys, over 250 entries wow! It's really great that you guys loved it so much, and some were even so nice that when they won, offered me to back out. 

That said, not all the items have been won this time round. 6 keys, as well as the color 216-190-216 bill's hat, were left behind. While this is a bit of a bummer, I have been thinking a bit about what I can do with them now. 

As those of you who read the post know, I quit because I was having a bad time with unusuals. The market is just too volatile and stressful for my liking, but after cooling down and considering my position, I think I would still like to keep trading, just not in unusuals. I believe this is the best decision for me, as I'm currently doing year 12 (final year of school in Australia) and this way I can spend less time focusing on this, and more on filling other life commitments. 

So expect me to return, with something big. It may not be tomorrow, or next week, but rest assured when I do, it will be worth it. And next time, the raffle will be up until someone wins it. No time limit.

So sorry to those who didn't win this time, I wish you all the best of luck. Watch out for me around /r/tf2trade, and stay tuned for Part II.

It's that time of the year when you cuddle up with your loved one, wear some warm clothes and pray to God to make the coming year the best in your life and look back on the year which is soon going to be a distant memory in our lives.

But, 2012 is no ordinary year, the MAYANS predicted we wouldn't see the end of it, but we DID. And that calls for some celebrations. 

And that's what exactly I'm going to do. I'm going to be giving away a LOT of items I think would serve others better than being in my backpack lying unused tonight. 

SO, if you're in need of a free item, feel free to post here. 

Here are the few things you should keep in mind.

* Do NOT add me if you're rich and able enough to be giving away items yourself. Because you should be just doing that rather than asking for some. :)

* People posting something cheerful or why I should giveaway some stuff to them might get some better items.

* New players of TF2 should definitely add me.

* Please do not be **greedy**. The item can be worth anywhere between a rec to a few keys. It'll entirely be upto be. DO NOT demand me anything.

Now, that that's out of the way. Let's start.

I'll be giving away items until nothing I don't want remains on my backpack. So, let the fun and festivities begin!

**NOTE** - DO NOT ADD ME, POST HERE. I'll ADD YOU!

After the first successful raffle of a [full tour of tickets](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/13ff8f/raffle_1_free_tour_6_tod_tickets/) went off without any problems, I have decided to have a little more fun with Christmas time.  Starting on the 13th, I will do 1 raffle each day leading up until the day of Christmas.  The plan is to elevate the level of prizes from day 1 all the way to day 12 in terms of value.  

But is there a catch???

There is always a catch.  If you win anything, you can't enter the any more raffles.  That is, until the last day.

* Exquisite Rack
* Industrial Festivizer
* A Rather Festive Tree
* The Bootie Time
* The Jingle Belt
* Dirty Merc's Pride
* Dirty The All-Father
* 5 ToD Tickets


IF you would like to donate a (Christmas Themed) prize or a little metal, feel free.  I have a feeling this is going to end up costly and I'll regret it.  But screw it, it's Christmas.

I can't believe how fast that was.  A player that goes by the name ""Burrito"".  He has asked me not to link to his profile directly.

I'l post the how-to crack down below.

&gt;Hey, I made a summary post at http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/14cxhn/check_out_my_first_map_i_made_for_tf2_it_also/
&gt;It was posted at /r/tf2 but I believe people from this subreddit would be more interested though. Basically I setup a difficult coded message in the latest map I made and first person to solve the code will win a bud. The message is encoded with several layers of encoding so it will take some work and possible a group effort. If you interested check out the post linked upon and check it out!
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: 
&gt;So here is the latest update, A tf2 player has already found the room.  He has shown some players where it is located so I will give a hint to where it is at.  There is a metal button sticking out of a tree in the lower level of the map.  Get close as close as you can and shoot it, it will teleport you to the secret room.  There you will find the code that needs to be decoded.  Once the code has fully been decoded you will end up with a message on how to claim the prize.  Goodluck everyone!

**PUZZLE SOLVED**: here is the step by step guide required to crack the code.

After the secret room was found, you were faced with the code.

I won't post the full code here but it is converted using the following method

Hex to ascii, Base64 to ascii,
Once the hex and base64 was decoded you were left with a link to an image with swedish writing saying ""You're not done yet"".  After that, the image can be renamed from image.jpg to image.zip then extracted.  It will extract a readme file that tells you how to claim your prize.  The prize has already been claimed and all other requests for the prize will be ignored.

The numbers only ever seem to go up, if this was movement between private backpacks I would expect ups and downs, I do not think however that 10,000+ buds coming onto the market can be explained by this.

I'm wondering if there is a constant stream of dupes entering the market in an as yet unknown glitch or some other system is in place.

The number of Bills has also gone up by around 10,000 in this time.

As these items are old I would expect Stats to have collected all statistical data on backpacks many times since their release, so Stats not finding the items yet seems very unlikely to me.

[Details Inside]",36,5,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/yenjb/h_tour_of_duty_tickets_x20_w_your_random_crap_so/,"Okay, I've been playing MvM as much as I could since the beginning, which, unfortunately, hasn't been that much, due to EVERYONE THE FREAKIN' WANTING TO PLAY TOO. Dangit people.

Anywho, I have bought a whole bunch so you can play too!

According to TF2 Spreadsheet, each ticket is worth 2.3 refined. That's alotta bologna, so I won't try and gouge you.

I don't want to give them away for nothing, so you will find that they're not free.  Then it will not feel earned! So I have a few, thrifty options!

----------------------------------------------------------------

Option 1: **Refined!**

You read it correctly. Refined is the life blood of TF2 trading! So simply, for people who want to play Mann Up who have refined, I ask for **2 refined** or **1 refined, a scrap, and a TF2 limerick.**

Because who doesn't love a good limerick?


-----------------------------------------------------

Option 2: **Keys!**

Let me be honest with you. I have almost a page full of crates. The only thing I'll be using these keys for is opening those puppies up. If I don't get any, I'll probably just throw them away, so let me know if you want a crate too!

1 Key per Ticket.

----------------------------------------------------------

Option 3: **HATS**

I need hats. They keep me sane. So if you have a craftable hat, any craftable hat at all, I'll trade you 1 ticket for it. 

Please. Help a brothah out.

--------------------------------------

Option 4: My Special Wants

These are for people who actually have the specific items, but I'm looking for these. (Must be craftable)

**Genuine Original: 4 Tickets**

**Genuine Righteous Bison: 5 Tickets**

**Sneaky Spats of Sneaking: 3 Tickets**

**Genuine Half-Zitoichi: 2 Tickets**

------------------------------------------------------------

That's it! **Max 2 Tickets Per Person, unless otherwise stated!**

Message me here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/nixon_smash

I will happily trade you, and I will be on for the next 2 hours for quick trades.

Thanks!

1342116538.0,28,self.tf2trade,wgc55,[Q] What do you consider good trade etiquette?,29,1,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/wgc55/q_what_do_you_consider_good_trade_etiquette/,"Hello fellow traders. Just a question of what you view as a good example of trade etiquette.

A bit of input from me:

- I hate when I get trade requests and the other person puts up a random item and says ""Offer"". I didn't ask to trade with you!

- Patience.

The total list:

- Changing the price when the window is open, items are loaded, and the trade is all ready to go.

- Opening a trade before saying a single word after friend invites are accepted. This more applies to approaching mass sellers...they might not have your item anymore. Just ask. Say hi! Anything!

- Responding to a post that asks for metal, getting to the trade window, and instead of metal adding all kinds of items to add up to the right amount. Check first, some people don't want to have to sell more stuff!

- Don't ask for a rep post on a normal freaking trade. Its just a bunch of fluff if you do that...trades have no inherent risk if its all in-game.

~El Mangosto

- Be polite

- Be fair

- Be understanding

~bigfrenak

- I hate when I get trade requests and the other person puts up a random item and says ""Offer"". I didn't ask to trade with you!

- Patience.

~Boozhau

I hate when I get trade requests and the other person puts up a random item and says ""Offer"". I didn't ask to trade with you!

That's a good one.

And on a related note, it's annoying as hell when I get unsolicited adds for my vivid defiant spartan (which I'm not selling and have never posted for sale), and they offer a medium-low price like 2.5-3 buds. Then I tell them I'm not really looking to sell it and I'd only take 4 buds for it (quite a high price), and they mock me for ""highballing"" them. Grinds my gears.

Also:

- Asking for +rep after a simple trade. Completely reasonable to ask for +rep if you've just made a cash trade or an unusual trade, but not after a basic trade.

- Adding people just to offer a price lower than the asking price. That's why trading sites have messaging systems in place.

- After adding someone, don't request a trade right away... Talk first, agree on a trade, then trade.

As always I offer discounts on bulk buys (that means you hat crafters) / I also welcome offers on expensive items and general pricing comments -- per subreddit guidelines just message me if any of my prices are bad or down vote me to hell as they prohibit us from publicly (pubic-ly?) bitching.  

All prices are in ref, however we can work payment out between a mixture of keys / metal / promos etc.

I'll also pay 1 scrap to the 1st person that can walk me through creating flair.

**On Reserving**

I will allow reservations of up to **six hours**. This is due to several people reserving things and then never returning. It gets very difficult to keep track of those reservations, and isn't very fair to other folks who wanna trade.

1. No ACE is not a scamming clan, it is a MW3 and a TF2 9v9 clan. 
2. Pillow, the scammer isn't related to us. I kicked him out right as I knew that he scammed people items.
3. All of our members don't scam. We don't even trade often except a few members. We care about the community and play games only.
4. I would like to point out that Pillow has scammed multiple items, beware of his steam rep on his profile page. It is all his friend's helping him out to fake rep. Here is a list what Pillow scammed as far as I know : 2 Buds, $150, 4 Unusuals, 4 Bills.
5. He told me that he will give me a free unusual a while ago, I asked him why but he never told me the reason. I did NOT accept it.

Accept a trade request you have shown interest in, don't make a player wait for more than 15 seconds.

Don't ask for a player to 'tell you what they have' when they say they are trading weapons for scrap.  Ask for what you want.

Nobody cares you got a strange sniper from your brother for 1 scrap, just because someone is selling at market price doesn't mean you're getting ripped off.  That shit is infuriating.

If someone has a shop, don't try to sell them something, that's a waste of their time.  They are obviously not in a buying mood.

If someone's selling something for a scrap, don't agree to it, and then offer two different class weapons.

When you accept the invitation you should shoot them a message over steam. This lets them know that you've accepted their friend request. Otherwise they wouldn't know that you've accepted unless they're ocd and check their friends tab constantly.

Next, the proper thing to do is usually to confirm the trade in steam chat (or if you've forgotten or don't know why they added you, ask them what they want).

After the trade is confirmed/agreed upon, agree upon using either ingame trade or steam beta. I don't really care either way, but you or the person you're trading with may have preferences.

Make the trade. This is the easy, obvious step.

Thank the person afterwards for the trade. It never hurts to be courteous. (Hint: People generally like it better when you aren't a total asshole towards them)

[Optional] Remove them from your friends list after the trade is complete and you both bid each other farewell.

Don't spam the same trade. Honestly, saying your trade more than once per minute is spamming. It's annoying seeing a flood of ""LF X WILLING TO TRADE Y FOR IT,"" but it's just as bad seeing the same message every minute for an hour when nobody new has joined the server. If there are no new players, after awhile you gotta think they're uninterested.


For here:

If you're going to put up a store, or want to trade, at least be around for 10 minutes before deciding to leave. Nothing is more annoying than finding a store that's been up for 46 seconds, and the person went to sleep.

I just today managed to get the [hat I always wanted](http://i.imgur.com/woORj.jpg). To begin with, thank you to all the fine young gentlemen on this subreddit who helped me get there. Whether it was prompt and accurate price checks or selling shit for appropriate prices, this place has been pretty sweet. Whenever I got a trade request from somebody I didn't recognize, I would ask them before the trade concluded where they found my name. I could **always tell** beforehand if they were from reddit, because these trades were always infinitely more courteous and pleasant. With your folks help, over the course of about 3 weeks I went from having two tradeable hats and no knowledge whatsoever to my very own, probably-should-be-painted-a-slightly-less-obnoxious-color Max's. So, in order to give back just a tad bit, I offer this thread filled with what little I know about trading to help the next person who wants to trade up.

**1) Fuck Vintage Hats**

Vintage hats are worth more than normal hats. This is true. But, by how much more? And to who? 

Here's the thing with vintage hats. Everybody wants a good vintage hat. If you have a vintage hat that's the best in the class, such as a Kabuto or a Tosslecap, that's in high demand. Everybody likes to wear a Kabuto, and the only thing better than a Kabuto is a hipster Kabuto that says ""my Kabuto is better than yours."" Enter vintage. But does anybody really want to wear that vintage old guadalajara? No, because it's ugly as shit. So who are the possible buyers for an v. old guadalajara [edit: whoops!]? 

- bargain hunters: you won't get much from these guys
- vintage collectors: people who are hunting for literally every single vintage hat for a specific class or just, pokemon style, catching 'em all.
- some weirdo who actually likes that hat! (I kid, I kid)

The fact of the matter is that with the exception of the true high-value vintage hats, the market for vintage hats is pretty damn small. If you want to sell your vintage hat, you either have to be extremely patient to find a collector or a weirdo, or you have to sell it so cheaply that somebody will buy it in hopes of flipping it for more. If you are offered a deal on a vintage, subtract a reclaimed or so from the ""market value"" and imagine that you'll have to sell it that cheaply. If you're not willing to be patient, you probably will.

Well, you ask, what's wrong with being patient?

**2) Fuck buying low, selling high**

Don't do that. Buy ridiculously low, sell slightly low. I'm not good with patience. You shouldn't be good with patience either. Here's an example. You have a Killer's Kabuto that you're trying to sell for 2ref. You post a thread on r/tf2trade, but nobody wants to buy it! That's no good. You post a trade on TF2TP, but you can't get it sold there either, because a thousand other traders are also selling their Kabuto for 2ref. It's a buyer's market. If somebody wants to pick a Kabuto, they choose a seller at random, and the odds they pick you aren't good. Now, in the meantime, while you were trying in vain to sell this Kabuto for 2ref, you could have sold it for 1.66, bought a craftable hat for a ref, and then flipped it for the reasonable price of 1.33, and made back the reclaimed you ""lost"" by selling your Kabuto for cheap. In the meantime, while you're trying to sell your 1.33 hat, run searches everywhere you can think of to see who is looking for it. Very frequently you can find either a 1.33 hat that's more in demand (meaning you can sell it faster) or somebody who's willing to trade a more expensive hat for it. Take these offers. A normal trade path goes something like: buy really shitty hat for cheap (1ref). Trade this hat a couple times until you've got a pretty decent hat that you can sell immediately for 1.66ref. Rinse, and repeat. 

**3) Fuck scrapbanking and weapon selling**

Yes, I know. It's guaranteed profit. Somebody's got to do it. Give up a scrap for two random weapons. Flip these weapons for a scrap apiece. If you get too many of any individual weapon, such as 4 or more, scrap a couple of em down and fuel future scrapbanking operations. It all sounds nice, but there's one gaping and horrendously irritating flaw: in order to make any decent sort of profit by doing this, you need to be incredibly committed. You need to be posting on reddit all the time, spamming TF2TP, and spamming trade servers constantly. What's more, you actually need to READ all the stuff people are saying in trade servers, because the majority of your profit comes when somebody pops into the server and says ""need a sydney sleeper quick.""

Is that really how you want to spend a few hours at a time, eking out a paltry few scrap here and there, reading all the garbage spouted on trade servers? Maybe it is. But it wasn't for me, and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody else either.

**4) Keep a bit, but minimal, amount of currency on hand at all times**

When a great deal comes by, you need to be in a position to take it. Recently, I saw a trade on TF2TP from a fellow who was willing to trade two decent vintage hats, five 2ref hats, and a 1.33ref hat all for a Bills. Clearly, this was a good deal, as you can, if you're patient, find a Bills for as little as 4 keys. If I hadn't had a Bills in my backpack at the time, though, I would have missed out on that easy profit opportunity. Keep a little bit of all types of currency in your backpack at all times, whether it be scrap, refined, keys, bills, or buds. Other than this bit of currency you keep for that day when you stumble across a great deal, though, you want to be as active with your currency as possible. You don't want to have 20 refined sitting in your backpack, you want to go out and buy 20 craft hats that you can then sell. Make your money work for you.

**The Good Stuff: Finding the Great Deals**

All of the above stuff I've said is all well and dandy. This place is not the best place to find profit, nor is this, nor is this, nor is this, nor is that. But people who have managed to read through all of the above will note that I haven't really given a great strategy! The advice of ""buy super low"" and ""don't populate trade servers as they are soul sucking havens of despair"" don't seem to go together. Where, exactly, does one find these great deals? How can you spend all of your built up refined metal into cheap hats which you can then trade? 

Automation. To begin with, it's incredibly simple to make a TF2 script that will say a message in alltalk and then bind that message to a key. You can hit that key periodically, or even make a macro on your OS of choice which will automatically ""hit"" that key periodically for you, perhaps once every minute. At that point in time, you're then free to go into trade servers while you read a book, eat breakfast, watch TV or a movie, and you only need to look up or pay attention when somebody trades you. This is a fantastic way to handle trade servers. Although you will probably miss out on the occasional deal that passes by (especially the cheap weapons deals), in my mind it more than makes up for that by relieving you of the tremendous tedium.

Well, you say, that's all very fine and dandy for hats, but what about more expensive things? What if I want to find keys for only 2 refined, or bills for only 4 keys, or buds for only 2 unpainted bills? How would I go about that?

It's very good of you to keep asking these relevant questions. The answer, of course, is more automation. And so I present to you, a [little script I whipped up](https://pastee.org/2e6za). The password is r/tf2trade. This perl script is a web scraper for TF2TP. It automatically refreshes and reads the recent page of TF2TP every 45 seconds, which is about enough so that you don't ever miss a single trade. Tell it what you're looking for and what currency you're looking to pay, and your browser will open up every new trade that meets those requirements. It's not very well written; I'm no CS major and I had never written anything in Perl before this. However, despite the miserable programming style, it's (as you can see) very easy to modify. If I learned how to program this in under a day, you can figure out how to modify this in just a few minutes, I have little doubt. Use this to know, immediately, the moment anybody on TF2TP is selling a key for 2refined. Use this in conjunction with your macro on a trade server spamming that you're buying keys for 2ref, and hats for 1ref. Things I would recommend adding onto the script include: an array of recent trade numbers, so that it doesn't pop up the same trade twice, and a more accurate wishlist parser (to stop you from seeing things such as trades offering keys for 2.33 when you're just looking for 2). None of these things would be prohibitively complex to implement, but I was lazy. This really is incredibly effective; I turn it on when I'm watching a movie, and usually by the end of the movie I've made a couple of quite good trades. Every day people are offering items for well below market value. You just need to be the first person to notice.

Enjoy the profit. Enjoy getting the items you're looking for while expending the minimal amount of effort possible. Enjoy spending your TF2 time actually playing TF2. 

Good luck :)",,False,,t5_2s0s4,True,,,True,t3_jco32,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jco32/im_selling_nothing_at_all_fireside_chat_inside/,
1310838825.0,29,self.tf2trade,irely,"Rules regarding ""Stores"" or ""Shops""",34,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/irely/rules_regarding_stores_or_shops/,"**Chances are this post does not apply to you if you are a casual trader.**

We have seen a rise in people opening ""stores"" or ""shops"" where they offer a large amount of items. Sometimes these stores ask users to make private offers that are either accepted or rejected.

Well, /r/TF2Trade's mission is the ""facilitation of smooth and *fair* item trading"". The other mods and I have discussed the issue and as former traders of unusuals and other items, we realize this can easily be abused. Generally, these stores operate mostly for profit and work this way: you make an offer and the ""shop keeper"" looks at your back pack, gauges your interest, and attempts to make you over-pay. That isn't cool. Therefore, we have decided that the following rules will apply to any ""store"".



All of the following criteria are required to be classified as a ""store"":

* Selling more than five items, resulting in your title requiring users to open the thread to see what you are selling

*  Only trading for ""keys"", ""metals"", or ""offers""

* Have a somewhat re-occuring thread submission selling the same or substantially similar items.




If the above are *substantially* met, you are considered a ""store"". Once considered a store, the following rules will apply to you:

* You must list all items for sale within your thread. You *may* list your backpack, but it isn't required.

* You must allow offers in the thread. However, you are permitted to request people talk to you in PM or Steam only after the initial offer within the trade thread.

* You must clearly state that you are a ""shop"" or ""store"".

* Stores must list the prices of each item or prices for items in a category.

**Failure to follow these rules will result in your post being removed.** ",,False,,t5_2s0s4,True,,trusted hat,True,t3_irely,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/irely/rules_regarding_stores_or_shops/,moderator
1374979435.0,30,self.tf2trade,1j72nu,[PSA] Cash trading guide: Bitcoin,37,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1j72nu/psa_cash_trading_guide_bitcoin/,"[Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org) is a good way to transfer money online. However, it's significantly from traditional payment processors such as PayPal in that it's decentralized. But what does this mean?

Bitcoin is not a payment processor. Bitcoin is a currency, it is a network, it is a system. There is no ""bank of Bitcoin"", and Bitcoins are not US Dollars. When you transfer Bitcoins, you're not transferring USD or any other fiat currency, you're transferring Bitcoins.

### What are the advantages?

When compared to PayPal, Bitcoin has a number of advantages:

- Decentralized: Nobody can freeze your account (like PayPal is so [prone to doing](http://www.paypalsucks.com)). And since it's decentralized, it's not regulated by any government. No paperwork!

- Lower fees: PayPal charges a fee of 2.9% + $0.30 for international transfers. Bitcoin's fees are much lower, usually less than $0.10. More importantly, **you pick your own fees.** (More on that later)

- **No chargebacks!** This is by far the largest advantage. When trading TF2 items via PayPal, you don't know if you've gotten scammed until 6 months later since the buyer can file a chargeback at any time.

### What are the disadvantages?

There are only a couple of disadvantages:

- Slightly slower: You don't truly *have* the money for about an hour.

- Slightly higher barrier to entry: If you want to convert fiat to Bitcoin, you have to go through an exchange.

- You're responsible for your money: If you have money in PayPal, PayPal isn't going to lose it. If they do, you can sue them. With Bitcoin, if you somehow lose access to your wallet (computer crashes, you forget a password, etc.), your money is **gone**.

### What is one Bitcoin worth?

A good Bitcoin conversion rate is located [here](http://www.preev.com/).

### How does it work?

There's a good video at [weusecoins.com](http://www.weusecoins.com).

### So how do I trade TF2 items for Bitcoin?

To get started, you're going to need a Bitcoin *wallet*. You can either download a client application on your computer or use a web-based service. My service of choice is [Blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info/wallet). If you sign up there, your wallet is encrypted with your password. They don't have access to your money, but if you forget your password, all of your money is gone forever.

Once you sign up, you should be taken to a screen that looks like [this](http://www.doctormckay.com/screenshots/2013-07-27_2216.png). The important thing to note is the jumble of numbers and letters in the center of the screen. This is your *address*. You'll share this address with people in order for them to send you coins. Think of it as an account number. You can create as many addresses as you want per wallet, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll stick with the one.

In order to get Bitcoins into your wallet, you can either have someone send some to you (sell something) or buy some from an exchange. [Mt.Gox](https://www.mtgox.com) is one of the most popular. I personally prefer [Camp BX](https://www.campbx.com).

### Getting Paid

Once you're ready to sell an item and you know how much BTC you want to get paid, just give the buyer your Bitcoin address. They'll send their coins to your address and you'll see the transaction on the ""Transactions"" tab of your wallet. **This is very important:** Note the ""confirmations"" that should be displayed by the transaction. When a payment is fresh, it is ""unconfirmed"". That is, nobody in the network has picked it up yet and declared that ""This is a valid transaction."" While a transaction is unconfirmed, there is a very small chance that the buyer will be able to ""double-spend"" the money, preventing you from getting it. This is a guide of how many confirmations you should wait for before considering the money ""yours"":

| Transaction Volume (USD Equivalent) | Confirmations |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|
| &lt; $10                                           | 0 - 1            |
| $10 - $25                                      | 1 - 2            |

The more confirmations a transaction has, the less the risk of a double-spend. 3 transactions is usually enough to ensure the funds, but 6 is the generally accepted verification number. Each confirmation takes about 10 minutes, so waiting for the full 6 confirmations will take about an hour. If a trader has large amounts of reputation, it's reasonably safe to accept lower numbers of confirmations.

When sending coins, you have the option of paying a fee. The buyer always pays the fee, but they may choose to pass it along to the seller by sending less coins (if both parties agree, of course). The fee is entirely voluntary, but highly recommended. The amount of the fee is determined by the buyer. **The higher the fee, the quicker the transaction is confirmed.** The recommended fee is 0.0005 - 0.001 BTC (currently $0.05 - $0.10). For a larger transaction, you should generally pay a higher fee (but it will always be cheaper than PayPal!).

### Converting to Fiat

You can convert your Bitcoins to fiat currency (traditional money) at a Bitcoin exchange. See the last paragraph of the ""So how do I trade TF2 items for Bitcoin?"" section.

### Staying Safe

PayPal is safer on the buyer's side, while Bitcoin is generally safer on the seller's side. However, by taking the necessary precautions, it's possible to make it safer for both sides. Standard cash trading rules apply. Those with more reputation should generally go first in a transaction. Middlemen are also highly recommended for high-volume transactions. With PayPal, the buyer has the dispute system to fall back on if they don't receive the items. This is not true with Bitcoin, so make sure that you're trading with someone who's very reputable.

Bitcoin addresses are entirely anonymous. There's no ""verified"" status like PayPal has. Ensure that the person you're trading with is trustworthy. Look for the traditional signs of a scammer: fresh Steam account, low number of items in their backpack (except for the high-value ones they're selling), low hours of TF2, no reputation, private backpack. These are all signs that you may be dealing with a scammer's alt. You may also wish to take into consideration the user's Steam Level. A user with a higher Steam Level has invested more into their Steam account and is therefore less likely to risk it by conducting a scam.

* A custom particle effect trail! (Customize it to your wildest dreams!)
* Some commands to use on the server!

--------------

Server perks will be given on a monthly basis at a rate of:

After you've donated, send [a message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftf2trade) with the type of flair you'd like and we'll set it for you. 
--

You can get your SteamID32 by:

1. Copy your Steamcommunity link at the top of your Steam profile page - [example picture](http://i.imgur.com/qvJ0p.png) - *If you don't see that, go to steam&gt;Settings&gt;Interface and tick on ""Display steam URL address bar when available.""*

Please be aware this may take a bit longer than donating through the sidebar.

**What exactly is my donation going towards?**

The donations we receive go straight into a coffer that we can only use on providing servers. Currently the donations are hosting:

* The main trade server at 66.151.138.145
* The vanilla trade server at 66.151.138.146
* Hosting our SourceBans site - where we ban all those nasty scammers and griefers from. http://bans.tf2trade.com/
* Hosting www.tf2trade.com

--------

**In-Server Perks:**

* /resizeme and /resizemyhead

This command does what it says. You can become super tiny or a giant and the damage you do will scale down or up with the change in size. If you change your head, it just changes the hitbox for your head depending on how you changed it. 

There is something weird with the plugin, where in some cases if you are at the highest setting of /resizeme, your hitbox will sometimes act as though you were the smallest. So for non-donors, aim for their feet pretty much anytime you see a resized player.

-------------

* /trail

Any donor/moderator/super mod/admin has their own trail which they can edit in several ways.

The NBS minecraft trade server is the sort of trade server made exclusively for sharking new players of their stuff. The rules include providing sanctions against linking or discussing any outside websites (including the spreadsheet to give new players the ballpark values they need to start trading), from commenting on other people's trades (when someone is obviously on the losing side of a trade), and more.

Just over two months ago I was banned from their server for posting links (which I apologized for) and commenting on trades (commenting wasn't against the rules then!). Basically, I was banned for a month. I wrote up an appeal on their forums, and without any response got the ban length extended to 2 months. After the two months were up, I headed back to the server to trade. I was banned again with the reason listed as the exact same as the previous ban without doing anything to provoke such action. Even if this is just my side of the story, there shouldn't have been a second ban if I had served my original 2 months.

The NBS server is clearly an authoritarian community where new players go to have their valuables removed from them and the owner, Markg, overexerts what little power he has.

Be very careful. I would advise Reddit not to head over there. It's not a friendly place.",,False,,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,t3_tc17d,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/tc17d/psa_nbs_trade_server_warning/,

1323367286.0,26,self.tf2trade,n52u0,Unusual Traders (Observations),32,6,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/n52u0/unusual_traders_observations/,"Sit down, boys and girls, and let me tell you a story.

A few weeks back I got it into my head that I wanted an unusual for my medic. Simple enough, I love playing medic, and having something shiny on my head sounded fun. I start hording keys and uncrating. Bad idea, don't uncrate for unusuals. I sell the stranges for cheap, take the metal, and eventually convert it into buds. 

So, I figure, alright, I'll use this singular bud to buy a logo or fetti medic hat. Something low end, one of the 'shit tier' hats. This was my first warning flag that unusual traders might just be ponces. No matter how hard I looked, I was 'lowballing'. These are highly undesired unusuals that I coulda sworn were marked for $30 roughly, so a bud shouldn't have been that low of an offer.

A little peeved, I open up my wallet and begin the long, painful process of buying unusuals. 

The first thing that I noticed is that once you get an unusual, you are screwed. Nobody gives a damn about your low-to-mid-tier effects; if it's not buds, it's not worth it. 

And then came the rip-off artists and scammers.

The scammers would urgently demand you pop open paypal so they could overpay for your unusual. Sometimes, I wished they weren't scammers; at least their prices reflected how unusual traders think the market is.

The rip-off artists are the worst. Scammers are dime a dozen scumbags, but rip-off artists form little cliques and pat each other on the back. Essentially, they target people new to unusuals and offer them very little (a couple of normal hats, maybe a bills if you're lucky). These fellas then turn around and sell the hat for what it's worth.

But you all surely know these things. No, the observation that I'm bringing to the table is what this thread is even for:

Unusual traders have absolutely no clue what their hats are worth.

I noticed that most unusuals have no basis for their price, offering up ""one of a kind!"" as an excuse to hyper inflate, or ""someone paid this much for it, you just have to take my word for it"". There are people who horde massive amounts of unusuals so they can horde massive amounts of buds so they can...do...something. I dunno, I'm still kinda fuzzy on what the purpose of this all is. If it's cash, when will they finally cash out?

There's no real rhyme or reason to the value of unusuals, either. Since it's based on appearance, you would think that'd make it highly subjective. You'd be right. Everyone's personal opinion of what looks cool shapes the hyper-inflated, bloated costs of unusuals even further. And while we're on this, is hearts medic actually valuable or not? I've had multiple hearts medic offers on what I *thought* were low-mid tier medic hats, at least low-mid tier according to the unusual trade community, which may or may not be as reliable as throwing a dart at a price chart.

Anyway, my simple little foray into unusuals is coming to a close. I've offered what I managed to scrap together for a medic effect that I particularly like, from someone that isn't turning their nose up at me or believing their unusual was gifted to them by God, and once I have my hands on the hat (it could be this one, or it could be that they reject my offer and I keep looking and find 'the hat') I plan to -never- touch unusuals again.

My advice, at the end of the day? Never get into unusual trading. Ever. The majority of the traders are rude rip-off artists that don't appear to play the game, hording items to inflate their prices so that they can continue to increase the difficulty for entering their 'elite' market. It's e-peens x50, and all I've gotten from it is a headache and a sour taste in my mouth.

I get a friend invite from Captain Crab Man: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050816434/

He says he has some money in his pay pal and he is interested in buying my p.energy Grimme Hatte. I check his profile and he has 23 hours played and only 14 items in his backpack. I ask him about it and he says he is on his brothers account, trying to get him set up with an unusual before he starts playing. I ask if he has a SourceOP rep thread. He said he does not because he only uses middlemen and real cash so its pointless for him to have a rep thread, but he gives me the steamrep of his middleman. He said he has a couple hundred bucks in his pay pal and asks what I will sell it for. I say 175$. ""hmmm.. ok, we will do it"" and then said for the hassle of me opening up a paypal account, he can overpay a little if I want. Which I thought was odd... Anyways, he says he knows a good middleman. and gives me the steamrep thread for an admin at UTC named Cloudy. I tell him I will set up a pay pal account and to hold on...

This is when I go to UTC and search through their admin for someone online. Their Head Forum Admin J.Jonah Jameson was online and when I explained what was happening, he was quick to help. feel free to drop him some love on his steam account http://steamcommunity.com/id/dailybugle/  . He tells me Cloudy is not even online. Anyways...

so I tell the scammer Im ready to go. I get into their trade. I tell them that I want a friend to join just to make sure everything seems legit. I invite the Admin (who has changed his name as to not send them running). We have a good laugh how the other two guys pretend to send their money to each other, and how they are thanking themselves for the tip they gave them. and then its my turn to trade. I stall them a little more while Jonah asks then how being an admin with UTC is. Then he changes his name back to his real handle and lets them know they are all busted, banned, and a negative mark on their steamrep. They act like its no big deal and and tells him the next time they do this they will impersonate him.

We are recruiting Junior Admins to help and operate the second account. Applicants from different time zones would be great!

Requirements: Minimum of 300 hours on tf2, Active Redditor and subscriber to r/tf2trade, commitment of 1 hour every other day. 

Responsibilities: Operate the Armory and maintain a basic idea of inventory. Smelting of certain weapons and trading for shortage weapons. 

To apply please leave your steam profile below. Rolmos and I will hold a small interview for selected candidates. 

Armory Usage Guidelines:
The Armory is a non for profit organization run by volunteers, remember to be polite to the Armory admins when dealing with them. 
The Armory is primarily meant for newer players (Players with less than 150 hours on TF2). 

As a new player you are allowed to pick 2 weapons from the Armory free of charge. 

Experienced Players may use the Armory for some 1:1 trades for weapons that are not shortage weapons. 

Each trade will only contain a maximum of 1 Shortage weapon. 

Any weapon with a stock of 4 or less is considered to be on Shortage.  Any weapon that the operating admin deems to be on shortage is considered a shortage weapon. (We might have 6 cow manglers, but the Armory just spend 2 refined getting them so they won’t simply be traded for an equalizer to an experienced players) 

We do not trade vintage/strange weapons or hats/paints/metal. The Armory reserves those as rewards for donation of shortage weapons. 

There is often a queue for trading the Armory, the order of trade will be determined by the order of when chat was first initiated. Randomly trading the Armory without prior chat will most likely be rejected. 

The on-duty admin of the Armory reserves the right to refuse any trade that they are uncomfortable with. 

Once you have finished getting your weapon, PLEASE REMOVE THE ARMORY ACCOUNT FROM YOUR FRIENDLIST. Our friend list is constantly on the verge of being full so this helps a lot. 

Trading the Armory:

1.	Join this [group]( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditarmory)
2.	Check the inventory of the Armory by clicking on the links in the group and see the availability of weapons you want and make appropriate adjustments so that your request would only involve one shortage weapon.
3.	Add the group admins named Reddit Armory / Reddit Armory 2 as friends
4.	Wait until your friend invite is accepted, and initiate a chat with the admin on duty [be polite]
5.	Type out your request, list out the weapons you want and donating if any. 
6.	Wait for the Admin to give you the heads up to initiate trade either in game or trade beta
7.	Do the trade, remove the Armory account from your friend list and repeat the process when you need us again.

1373648619.0,24,self.tf2trade,1i5w9j,[Store] [F]orty+ Unusuals to choose from. Please cum in and take a look?;),36,12,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1i5w9j/store_forty_unusuals_to_choose_from_please_cum_in/,"Hello! Welcome to Toreutic's Unusual Shoppe. 

Here I present to you a wide arrangement of many sexy hats, with something for everyone.

Before offering, **PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING**

When offering these are things things I **do not** want or will **severely undervalue**:

* Craft Numbers
* Rare Glitched Items
* Special Levels
* Rare Vintages
* Large amounts of small sweets
* Games
* At the moment **I do not take cash**

Generally I'm open to all offers, however, pure obviously takes priority. For unusual offers I expect overpay

For a **general idea** of what I would value your unusual at in terms of pure:

1. Go to bp.tf  

2. Take the lower end/minimum price. 

3. Prices will vary depending on my personal feel for the hat

4. Number 3 applies especially for higher tier effects

As I said before, I'm open to all offers but effects I am **not particularly fond of/will undervalue**:

* Cauldron Bubbles
* Eerie Fire
* Lantern
* Nuts n Bolts
* Knifestorm


I prefer cheaper hats over multiple to one for a higher tier hat. 


**Notable Offers**

* N/A

**NOTE: Please DO NOT add me unless paying the listed price!**

**Key Stuff**

* N/A


**Shit Below Bp.tf**
 
* N/A


Without further ado:

**Also Buying Other Unusuals**

As you know I am an unusual dealer, so I'm also down to buy other people's hats for pure. 

However, I trade for profit, so sadly I **usually don't pay above bp.tf's minimum price**. 

Depending on this situation, my offer will change.

If you want to sell me an unusual, just leave the **hat/effect/asking price**, along with any other additional details you feel I should know about. If I'm interested, I shall accept/counter offer. Please do not be offended if I lowball. 

Cheers!

1361581308.0,28,self.tf2trade,191zrp,[PSA] New Unusual Server from PyroProtectMe!!,32,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/191zrp/psa_new_unusual_server_from_pyroprotectme/,"Hello everyone!

Over the past couple of months it has become apparent that despite having multiple unusual trading servers, including RAWR, TF2-T, PinkTaco and WantedGov (amongst several more) there is still a real gap in the market.

PyroProtectMe has recently started up a new unusual server and has employed EFF and Katniss as Primary admins and they have taken me on as a third admin.

After just 4 days we're already seeing our server begin to fill up and a community brewing and we'd love more to come and join us and become regulars!

So first things first, for those who want the technical details:

* Website: Rules, Faq's and other information can be found here www.pyroprotectme.com
* Server's IP is [68.232.169.106:27015](steam://connect/68.232.169.106:27015#/btn/lft/serverlink/1/)
* All the server maps are available for download at the website for your convenience. We are currently using Unusual_Trade_Pyro_v2ubeta3 on the Unusual Trade Server.

What gap are we filling?
---

**Nurtured Community**  
We really feel that as admins enforcing the rules is only part of our jobs. Keeping the peace in a server is less than a bare minimum. People should feel welcome on our server, feel free to seek out advice from us and from other community members.

We'd like the PPM server to become a home for many unusual traders but a welcome stopping point for any and all traders and somewhere that they can feel welcome to seek out advice from those who have more experience or simply experience in different areas.

If you haven't owned a hat or traded it a lot of factors can come into play when accepting an offer, from relative worth to the payoff of consolidating multiple hats to higher tier hats/effects or vice versa, breaking a high value hat into multiple lower value hats for better liquidity.

We hope to be able to breed a community where people can rely on both the knowledge of the administrators and the knowledge of the community to make informed decisions on their trades so that people are more satisfied with their trades.

**New Unusual Traders**  
We've really come to understand that the market is in a place where there are a lot of people getting their first unusuals and just cutting their teeth in a higher tier of trading and that there isn't really anywhere for them to go. We hope to really help nurture a community in which newer traders can get a handle on Unusual trading and seek advice without worrying about looking good - a lack of experience should not mean you have a second rate experience.

We look forward to seeing you around!

All the best,

Most of them I've kept as friends, but now they've all retracted. Why? Because Backpack.tf says that my unusual is now worth 2.33-2.66.

What the fuck is up with that? I couldn't comment anymore because it was done, but that's really frustrating knowing that a single fucking website dictates the prices.

1359588195.0,29,self.tf2trade,17lccd,[Q] Anyone else think Unusual's should be measured in bill's instead of bud's?,53,24,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/17lccd/q_anyone_else_think_unusuals_should_be_measured/,"PSo over the past few months the price of buds have fluctuated incredibly. I remember when they were around 28 keys and since everyone measured unusual's in buds, the price of a 2 bud unusual was 56 keys. Now even though the price of this unusual was 56 keys since it was measured in buds the price could fluctuate incredibly. Later on during halloween the price of buds dropped and at one point you could get one bud for 25 keys. Now all the sudden this 2 bud unusual went from being 56 keys all the way down to 50 keys in a matter of months. Not because the unusual devalued but because the currency that it is measured in devalued.

Now bud's are back to around 26.5 keys. This unusual all though it has never changed in value all the sudden the price went from 56 keys to 50 keys and is now around 53 keys. Hopefully your still following me.


Now if we change the unusual we were talking and create one worth 10 buds, all the sudden that small difference add's up. that unusual would have been 280 keys then 250 keys then 265 keys. that's over 37$ in fluctuation. Not because the unusual devalued but because the currency it's measured it devalued.

Bill's however haven't changed price in 5 months and the last time they changed price was around a 1.75 ref change. Everywhere the consensus is a bill's hat is 8 keys. Obviously painted bill's can very but a non painted bill's is always been 8 keys since i started trading. 

For this reason I believe Unusual's should be measured in Bill's and keys compared to buds and keys. Obviously with the really high unusual's there will have to be a different form of measurement like the HOUWAR, holiday headcase or max head. Hopefully some people understand what i'm saying because i just typed this out and i don't want it to go wasted. 

Here's some stat's for whoever is still reading this
**According to stats.tf**

* 55,202 Earbud's
* 126,001 Bill's Hat's
* There is 2.28 Bill's hat's for every earbud
* If we make 1 earbud = 27 keys then 1 bud = 3.375 bill's

**TL;DR**

Unusual's should be measured in bill's and keys instead of bud's and keys. The reason is because bud's have been fluctuating in price over the past few months. For example a 10 bud hat that hasn't changed in terms of buds in the past 4 months has changed from being 280$ to 250$ to 265$. Not because the unusual devalued but because the currency it's measured it devalued. I believe measuring unusual's in bill's may solve this problem because a bill's hat hasn't  changed price in 5 months and when it last changed price it was only around 1.75 ref change

WINNER IS Solum **734!
My favourite moment was going Battlemedic, with my regular Overdose/Medigun/Ubersaw set. A scout jumped over my head to try to flank me, and I managed to crit him from underneath. It was incredible to see him flying. I think I managed 10 kills in that life, even.
Both teams weren't very good :(**

[W] Offers in Promos/Keys.",29,4,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/wcas3/h_the_ugliest_awefulest_unusual_ever_to_grace/,"It is said that on the night this hat was unboxed, a chorus of demons could be heard singing hymns to Satan while playing orphan's intestines like stringed instruments. The masses cried out in misery, praying to God for a quick and painless death so they could escape the torment. Their cries went unanswered, and the horror continued on through the night. Or maybe that was just a Nickleback concert. Regardless, something terrible must have happened the moment this hat was uncrated, there is no other explanation for its power of awefulness.

I see other posts offering Unusuals in trade and trying to enhance their value by espousing a theme for it. Well, there's no theme here. This hat looks like a turd complete with bits of shit flying out after it. A turd with flying turds is just a fresh turd, and my conscience cannot allow me to say otherwise. This hat has been known to make children cry, make women faint, and it has caused men to forsake all honor and go hatless for fear of associating with this piece of head ware. This hat will haunt your dreams and harrow your very soul.

This hat is so ugly, Steve Buscemi was going to take it to high school prom but chose to go stag instead. The hat was heartbroken, of course, even though she was just a regular mountain cap back then. She'd had a crush on Steve ever since he killed that spider for her in second grade, but she'd always been too shy to ask him out until senior year prom. This was going to be their night. But instead, she stayed at home, watching soap operas and eating generic brand ice cream. She boxed herself up that night, hoping that some day she'd become a beautiful Unusual, and maybe her sunbeams would be enough to win Steve back and get her happy ending. Then, years later, I opened the crate and disappointment hit us both like a train of... well, disappointment.

The following is a picture of the hat, but I must warn you to vacate the area of children and small animals before you follow it. Seriously, shit could die. You have been warned.

See? Told ya so. And now your cat's dead because you didn't listen. Don't pay attention to the Medic in the photo. He's just thumbs upping the Sniper across the street to end his hat induced misery. So that's the hat I'm selling. God only knows why you'd bid on it though. I feel dirty just having it in my backpack. Seriously. Don't buy this hat. It brings nothing but sorrow and heartbreak.

Opera.",28,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/w8e63/psa_i_ported_the_flair_linker_script_by_zedadex/,"So, um, hi there.

As the title suggests, I took [this script](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/kaucc/tf2trade_flair_linker/) and ported it to Opera. I liked the idea of this script, but sadly, it wasn't available for Opera so I decided to port it on my own.

Currently, it's offering the exact same functionality as the original user script. There are no different versions for the different backpack viewers because you can change your preferred backpack viewer in the settings.

It is *not* a user script. User scripts can't access the internet (or in this case, steamcommunity.com to check the user's status) in Opera, that's why it's now an extension. Extensions *can* access the internet (but only the background process, that makes it a little bit more complex), so that's the only way to make this work in Opera.

If you don't feel like installing an extension made by a random stranger on the internet, don't worry, because I assure you it's perfectly safe™. If you want to take a look at the source code, feel free to do so! The .oex file is actually a renamed zip file, so you can extract it with your favorite zip tool and look at the source code.

So, let's get to the point. **Download it [here](http://jerry.devzero.info/up/code/extensions/opera/tf2tradeflair.oex)!** The default backpack viewer is [TF2B](http://tf2b.com/), but it also supports [TF2Items](http://tf2items.com/) and [backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf). If you want to change the backpack viewer, press Ctrl + Shift + E to access the list of currently installed extensions, and go to the settings page of this extension.

(If the backpack link doesn't work, that's probably [Opera's fault](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10772322/opera-extension-preferences-through-config-xml). In this case, just set your preferred backpack viewer in the settings, they can be accessed by pressing Ctrl + Shift + E.)

Hey everyone who's signed up for /r/tf2trade highlander!

Firstly, if you haven't joined this group (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/tf2tradehighlander), please do.  It's much easier to make announcements there and I feel like I'm bothering people trying to trade in here.  

We're about to have a group chat in 5 minutes, (5PM PST), so please join the group chat.  We're going to discuss times and availability for scrims and also an informal meet and greet. 

If you are reading this and have either missed the chat or are unable to attend, etc. please PM ASAP about your availability to play scrims, etc. so we can get those started!

We're aiming to start scrims around mid-July, after we do a few more MGE matches with some classes.
